It passed the smooch test and didn't transfer to my guy's lips.   Lasted way longer than NYX soft matte lip creams. Not as long as KVD, but since those are $20 a piece I can't complain. Needed to be touched up in the center after eating and drinking. I was impressed for the $3 I paid."

I have Vivid, Artistic, and Striking and I love all three. The pigment is fantastic, the longevity of the wear is all frickin day, and while they do take a while to dry, they don't budge once they do dry. Seriously I love these lip products so much. Definitely one of the better Ulta brand products!"

drugstoreMUA,3duqaw,dutchessgummybunz,4,Mon Jul 20 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"I love liquid lipsticks and KVD is my favorite brand. I have a ton of those, but $20 a pop is so much. I bought one of the Ulta ones for $3, not thinking too much about it. For that price, I could take a chance.   My first try, it was okay. A little patchy. I got a dark color. I forget what it's called, but it's a purply color.   When I tried it again, I balm and lip primer under. I did one thin layer and let it dry and then applied a second layer. It was actually really nice. It's a really light formula. I didn't find it any more drying than any other liquid lipstick. And it was actually much less drying then some I've tried. I actually like it a lot and will probably buy one or two other colors. I want to try to new NYX liquid suede ones when they're all out too.   Here's a sort of lame photo! Evidently, that's the only photo I took that day lol."

I haven't tried it out yet but I just wanted to let you know about the deal! Edit: I just tried it out for a few hours and it's actually really nice! It's not at all drying and it lasted through eating and drinking and general wear for a few hours. I'm sure it actually wears for much longer but I wiped it off for bed."
drugstoreMUA,3duqaw,Ysenia,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:59 2015 UTC,"Hope you don't mind me linking, I did a review a few months back when they first came out :) There are swatches, including allusive :D  I found them to be more moisturixing and not as dry feeling as the Nyx matte creams, but that also made them a smidge messier to apply. They lasted longer than my Nyx creams did and passed the smooch test. There was also very little transfer to my coffee cup, and I had to use coconut oil to get the swatches off my arms.  They do take a bit to actually dry to matte, though, so be aware of that."

The darker colors are a bit more work to make not patchy,  but it's really not that bad.  KVD vampira is harder for me to get looking smooth. They do take longer to dry,  but once they do they stick really well on me.    At $3 each,  they're totally worth it if you don't have those colors yet.  I use tender sooo often!"

drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,horse__tornado,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:48 2015 UTC,i actually just bought the wet n wild pearlescent pink one yesterday and im wearing it today. i was worried it would be too sparkly but its not and the color is gorgeous!
drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,obamanisha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:23 2015 UTC,i had a wet n wild blush in mellow wine or something like that and i liked the soft texture but goodness that was a bad shade for me lol. kinda glad it broke so i had a reason to throw it away

drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,Dream-On,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:14 2015 UTC,I concur. I was totally let down by Luminoso but I picked up Berry Amore and it's just the most beautiful colour! Corals look a bit bland on me but berries are perfect. Maybe it's the same situation for you?
drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,dangerstar19,3,Sat Jul 18 04:08:45 2015 UTC,ive heard a lot about it but the only store that carries it near me is cvs and its alwaaaaaaays empty. if i ever get my hands on it i cant wait to try it
drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,nutmegs226,2,Thu Jul 16 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"If they have Rose D'Oro, that's a good one too. Luminoso is one of my summery blushes and Rose D'Oro is my wintery one, it's a nice rose with a hint of bronze. But I'm fair and it works on me. I know they have some newer matte blushes too that you could try.   Also I second the recommendation of the NYX Cream Blushes. I have one in Glow and if I layer a Milani blush over it, it lasts all day."

drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,itsok_imapirate,3,Thu Jul 16 15:57:41 2015 UTC,have you tried the bouncy ones at all? they look like so much fun but that doesnt really mean they go on well lol

drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,USB_everything,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:30 2015 UTC,I absolutely love the bouncy peach one. I'm almost finished it actually and have had it for a year. It's my go to between 6 other drugstore blushes that I own.
drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,nutmegs226,2,Fri Jul 17 00:25:39 2015 UTC,that one looks gorgeous to me

drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,misskayleykay,2,Fri Jul 17 02:47:29 2015 UTC,Looks like you have a lot of light pink/peachyness going on. Try Maybelline Master Glaze in Plums Up and elf Pink Passion for something different.
drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,deanywinchester,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:18:40 2015 UTC,yes i was looking for a natural look but those seem to be too subtle on my skin. my skin is just naturally red (no eczema or rosacea) so those ones dont seem to show up over the little bit of redness that's left after foundation
drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,deanywinchester,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"I like the rest of the essence line as well. I had the one in sweetheart I think, it was a bit too pigmented for me (my first blush so I didn't really know how to work it haha) and then it shattered when I dropped it :( I put it back together with alcohol but the color is different now, so I don't use it anymore. One of my favourites is their Adorable shade, it's very light so it's easier not to mess it up even with my heavy hand. I have their gradient one in Heat wave, it goes from pink to orange so there's a lot of shades to work with. There's another shade in the gradient collection, going from pink to a lavender purple, which I would totally buy if it wasn't shimmery (I have oilier skin so anything that shimmers is a bit off limits). You should also check out Catrice if you can, they have a few gradient ones as well, but they follow the same color coordination instead of mixing 2 colors. I like getting it onto my brush in such a way that the lighter color will get on my cheekbone, the middle shade is on the apples of my cheeks, and the darker one goes underneath for the tiniest bit of contour ever."
drugstoreMUA,3di5dm,deanywinchester,3,Thu Jul 16 15:31:50 2015 UTC,i just got the essence blush last time i was at ulta and plan on getting more when i go back. i had no idea that i would love their formula this much lol. those colors sounds great! wherei have oily skin but i still love some shimmer lol oh well. where is catrice sold?

I found pictures of the packing and it looks familiar and I remember that brand. But unfortunately I couldn't find the actual lipstick for sale anywhere or even just a picture. I did find reviews on it and everyone described the color and smell I remember. Do you happen to know if that brand was sold at Walmart? Because I'm pretty sure that's where I got it.

Usually a few 8 pan palettes, a liner, and a few satin finish lipsticks. I haven't seen this one in stores unfortunately :/ I'll keep my eye out for it, but mostly I have: NYX, Maybelline, L'oreal, NYC, Revlon, Physician's formula, Marcelle, Annabelle, and a very small selection of E.L.F, Milani, and Wet n Wild. Probably a few others whose names escape me too"
drugstoreMUA,3crj43,lady-darlington,3,Fri Jul 10 05:35:39 2015 UTC,what about NYX Matte Lipstick in Maison? or Milani Teddy Bare (lighter brown/darker nude with a creamy finish) or Double Espresso (darker brown with a frosty finish).

drugstoreMUA,3crj43,ProjectCherry,2,Sat Jul 11 08:49:46 2015 UTC,I like Revlon's ColorBurst Lacquer Balm in Coy! It's a brown I wear in the evenings and to work. You do need to reapply once every 30-45 minutes but it's a comfortable formula and the sheen is pretty so I really like it.
drugstoreMUA,3crj43,kaleidoscopic_prism,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:04:26 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm your brown lipstick best friend!!!!  I just realized Truffle in Paradise is in my collection, which means you have probably looked at many of the same colors I probably have.   LipStain- Palladio Lip Ink in Nude   (buy at Sally Beauty) Medium brown felt tip marker style, will even out your lip color.  Cover with a nice gloss and you're good.  I did try a similar Cover Girl stain, but it dried out super fast, and I had to throw it away.   Lip Stain- Maybelline Super Stay 10 Stain Gloss in Blissful Brown   This came in a tube with a wand applicator.  They don't make this anymore (as far as I know).  I am very upset!  It is by far my favorite lip product and if they still made it I would buy 10 of them and not buy anything else.  If anyone reading this knows where to get some, let me know!   Lip Pencil- Revlon Colorburst Lacquer Balm in Coy   (this is very similar to your Wet & Wild pencil so maybe skip this one.  It is slightly less red, but only slightly)     Lipstick- Rimmel Lasting Finish in Metallic Seduction   This is a deep berry brown with pretty shimmer, you may not like this one if you don't like your Wet & Wild pencil.   Lipstick- Rimmel Lasting Finish in Heather Shimmer   This is a medium brown with a hint of mauve frost.     Lipstick- Maybelline Super Stay 14 HR Lipstick in Lasting Chestnut   I can't wear this alone.  This is a super dry matte lipstick.  But if I put this on and put a color or gloss on over it, it extends the wear of that product by A LOT.  And it's brown so it's the perfect base for whatever I put on next, which is also going to be brown.  I guess I consider this my brown primer now. :)   Lip Gloss- Palladio Herbal Lip Lacquer in Tahiti Plum    (buy at Sally Beauty) This is one of the only lip colors that I get regular compliments on, so this is what I color match when I'm at the store buying other lipstick.  (gloss just doesn't last right?)  Rich berry brown.   Lip Gloss- Almay Color + Care in Truffle   Brown with a hint of shimmer.  Lightly scented, super moisturizing, never sticky.  This is what I get out when I need moisturizing, and then I look fabulous too. :)   Lip Gloss- Almay Color + Care in Just Plum   More of a berry, but looks good on me so will probably look good on you too.  Lightly scented, super moisturizing, never sticky.   Lip Gloss- Rimmel Stay Glossy 3D in Love At The Movies   This is a very glossy brown with light pink shimmer glitter in it.  For when you really want to be glossy shimmery.   Things that did not work out:    Wet & Wild Megalast Liquid in I Can Bare It - This is not a bad color, but the formula is not good.  It makes my lips look wrinkly and dry, and they feel like they're coated in plastic.  It looks bad and feels bad.  Don't waste your 3 bucks.  I have tried the Revlon Just Bitten Kissable Balm Stain in Adore.  It goes on dark red but when it comes off it is definitely pink stain.   The red looks pretty good.  The pink looks pretty bad.  The formula is AWESOME.  I can put it on and eat and drink and talk and it stays put. If you find a color you like, this could be a lifetime product for someone.  I'm very disappointed that they don't have a brown in this line.   Wet n Wild Vicious Varnish High Shine Lip Stain in Runway Red - well this is actually hot magenta pink on me.  It has to be the formula, because when I wipe it off with a tissue, it is definitely hot pink on the tissue as well.  Another 3 bucks down the drain.  (When brown isn't readily available, I go for the closest option which is usually a dark red)  I think maybe some of the other ladies here can vouch that red in the tube doesn't always mean red on your skin.  Ok what do you have so I can look them up? :)"
drugstoreMUA,3clz0g,BabyyImaStar,7,Wed Jul 8 23:07:38 2015 UTC,Do you actually use the flat foundation brush for foundation? Or do you repurpose them? I can never find a use for mine :(

drugstoreMUA,3clz0g,Preziosavita,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:51:10 2015 UTC,I really like Maybelline Fit Me (original / dewy + smooth) applied with the ELF stippling brush. It gives such a good my skin but better finish!  If only it was a better color match for me.

drugstoreMUA,3cmjui,Daniamador912,4,Thu Jul 9 01:54:47 2015 UTC,"What kind of liner do you usually use? I have been pretty happy with NYX super skinny marker, but I am most used to felt-tip pens. It's opaque and it hasn't smudged on me in hot subways and always applies perfectly, and is super dark. Only thing is it can fade. It doesn't move though.   I have also had very good luck with gel liner in a pot, but for everyday I gravitate to pens and they are faster for me and easier to do half asleep. But gel liner has stayed and not faded for me all day."
drugstoreMUA,3cmjui,ughomgg,5,Thu Jul 9 03:13:44 2015 UTC,"For pens, I use Rimmel, usually either their retractable or precision ones. If you're looking for coloured eyeliner, I really like Annabelle's pens. Both Rimmel and Annabelle eyeliners tend to be pretty pigmented. I'm South Asian and the colours still show up amazingly on my skin.   My go-to eyeliner is definitely Maybelline's Lasting Drama gel eyeliner. I usually use the black one, but the Eggplant one is pretty amazing too. The colour payoff is pretty fantastic and I really like the brush that comes along with it. This stuff also stays.     DO NOT, however, buy Maybelline's Master Duo Liquid Liner. I have two, in teal and purple, and the colours are completely muddy and the liquid is too thin. I do not recommend this product at all."
drugstoreMUA,3cmjui,Crazy_Overlord,2,Thu Jul 9 08:23:43 2015 UTC,"if you're looking for a retractable pencil, revlon color stay is my go-to. For gel, I use maybelline 24hr which is fantastic and i prefer it over a lot of higher end gel eyeliners. I have slightly hooded eyes and neither smudge, so I consider that a pretty good test!"
drugstoreMUA,3cmjui,belletaco,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:22:58 2015 UTC,Pencils are more of my thing. I used gel eyeliner for a while but abandoned that ship. I thing I might go back to it though.

drugstoreMUA,3cmjui,BabyyImaStar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:16:32 2015 UTC,"I used one of Hard Candy's new liquid liners last night (It was a beautiful bright blue color) on my upper lash line, and it lasted a full 8 hour shift. When I got home, I even had to use a liquid eye makeup remover, as my makeup wipes wouldn't budge it!    It's the brush type, and controls easily.  The brush is a little wide, though.  I think you'd have to use the tape trick to get a sharp wing."

I have both in shade ivory, the lightest (or second lightest, I can't remember). The liquid one seems like it's a tad darker. I doubt they can get perfect shade match when they change up the formula but they seem to try. The difference in color is about my natural difference between tan and untanned skin (read: basically nothing and I can barely see a difference) so it works out nicely."

drugstoreMUA,3ch1p9,jsitch,0,Sat Jul 11 08:53:48 2015 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of the milani eye primer but I've seen a few looks on here with that in the product list and they were fierce. Also an oily lid friendly primer
drugstoreMUA,3ch1p9,Ireselle,2,Wed Jul 8 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"I have never tried the urban decay one, as it's not available in my country. But the elf one is good enough that I use only that, because I can't be bothered with anything else anymore. My lids also tend to get quite oily and the formula in the elf is quite dry so I'm enjoying it.   Either way I think it's worth it to try it. It isn't expensive, and it could be the primer for you. :)"

drugstoreMUA,3ch1p9,MissyTX,3,Wed Jul 8 07:51:01 2015 UTC,"I love the Hydrating Under Eye Primer. It has been the only thing that has helped any form of concealer not crease under my eyes.

Normally, the brown tone in it is brown (shocking) but when I use it over the elf primer, it takes on a reddish/purplish tone that is really nice.  Just a tip to try if anyone else has those things! I haven't noticed a change with any other eye shadows I have, but give it a try."

drugstoreMUA,3ch1p9,azumane,2,Wed Jul 8 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"I love the cream eyeliners (especially the little brush that comes with them; it's tiny, though, so you have to make sure to store it somewhere where it's not going to escape) and the Studio blush and bronzer, both the cream and the powder. Also, their clear lash/brow mascara is great, though it tends to run out pretty quick, and their Studio matte lip colour is great, too, but both of the ones I owned snapped right at the base."
drugstoreMUA,3ch1p9,Kentorrr,2,Wed Jul 8 03:56:20 2015 UTC,"The angled blush brush, the small tapered brush (for contour or highlight), and the eyeshadow crease brush are all exceptionally good. The prism shadow palettes are fantastic if you like the metallic-foiled shadow look."
drugstoreMUA,3ch1p9,deadpolice,2,Wed Jul 8 05:33:24 2015 UTC,"I loooove their studio brushes. Also, the eyebrow kit and the daily brush cleaner. To be honest, I was super into ELF for a while when I got back into makeup but their products are super hit or miss for me. I would say the studio line (the products that come in the black boxes) are well worth the few extra dollars. I've switched over to using mostly NYX and L'Oréal."
drugstoreMUA,3ch1p9,floppy_catfish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:18:07 2015 UTC,I swear their cream eyeliner is the best of its kind. The brown one makes a passable dipbrow dupe (that will NOT budge) so if you can make the color work for you I highly recommend it. But the black one is a must have... drugstore winged liner does not get better than this.
drugstoreMUA,3ccwof,tsunshun-,7,Mon Jul 6 22:52:07 2015 UTC,"I posted this to /r/makeupaddiction but figured it'd be fitting to post here as well!  Hello MUA! I live in New York and was able to grab the E.L.F ALP in one of their stores today. I've heard much hype about this product and have been dying to check it out. It's currently out of stock on their website, but it should hopefully restock soon.   Anyways... On to the review!    Packaging ― I'm in love with the overall design of the palette. The matte black case itself is very compact and minimalistic. It comes with a huge mirror which is a huge plus. I can see myself putting this product in my bag, as I believe it'll travel very well. However, the product's pans are quite small. I usually use a large buffing brush for my finishing powders, but when I used that brush it would accidentally touch another color (because the brush was much larger than the pan).  Texture ― All of the colors have a very creamy feel which makes them great for blending. I didn't however like the amount of fallout during application. If you look closely at the swatches, you can see the excess product that was left over top. In the album I did a brief comparison to my Hourglass ALP, and found that the Hourglass colors were a lot smoother and had a overall greater consistency (which was to be expected).  Colors ― I don't have any complaints. The palette seemed to cater to the usual ""finishing powder"" color scheme. I'm a NC30 and found that the colors showed up just fine. I don't know how they'll hold up on darker skin tones.    Disney Highlighting Stick Review   I stumbled across Disney's Dare to Dream collection at my local Duane Reade. Nothing in particular caught my eye, until I saw the Pocahontas highlight sticks. They came in three shades: Wild Spirit, Great Spirit, and Free Spirit. I only purchased Free and Wild Spirit, but can definitely see myself picking up the third shade. They're only $3!!!! Insanity. These products are made by the same people of WnW Cosmetics, so the quality is quite good!    Packaging ― Not a huge fan. The plastic feels cheap and easily breakable. It's feels essentially like the plastic shell of the WnW Megalast lipsticks.  Texture ― Truly amazing!! The colors were incredibly pigmented and creamy. There are no visible chunks of glitter. It was a dream blending these. I used to own the NARS bronzing Multiple, and while the quality isn't exactly the same... I would say that they're similar!  Colors ― Free Spirit is my favorite out of the two. It's a perfect golden or pale yellow highlight. The other color Wild Spirit is also very beautiful. As I said before, I'm a NC30 and feel that this shade gives me a nice healthy bronzed glow without making me look orange."

drugstoreMUA,3ccdw0,toofacedjas,5,Mon Jul 6 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"I usually don't use matte foundation, these are two foundations I've used on others that left a matte finish + held up well on hot, summer days: × Revlon Color stay foundation × Cover Girl Ready, Set, Gorgeous foundation  EDIT: More costly foundations w/ a satin-matte finish: Make Up For Ever HD foundation — this foundation has a good shade range, catering to the palest and deepest skin tones. It gives satin finish without clinging to any dry spots i have. Its medium coverage and can be sheered out by using a beauty blender. It is a personal favorite of mine.  Stila Stay All Day foundation: I have a love hate with this foundation, on hot summer days it works well to control oil, leave me with a beautiful semi-matte/satin finish; during the winter/colder days it sits on the skin, making my skin look dry. This another one that I like sheering out with a beauty blender, because I do have dry skin."

As mattifying foundations from the drugstore go, though, Rimmel Stay Matte is great. It's SUPER thick but buffs out well and has great coverage."

I'm suuuuuper pale and neutral toned and similar skin (no acne/scars/etc.) so maybe it'll work for you! I can check when I get home if you're interested?
drugstoreMUA,3ccdw0,frecklesandgeckos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:00:38 2015 UTC,"Depending how far off the fair scale you are, I have tried a few you might be interested in:  Maybelline Fit Me Dewy and Smooth -- This isn't matte, and the palest (110 Porcelain) is slightly too dark for me, but it applies beautifully and just looks like perfect skin on me. Otoh, it's a little slick and transfers more than I'd like (mostly into my phone) and it has that traditional makeupy smell, which I find gross. I like it, in spite of all those caveats, better than any other liquid foundation I've tried prior to today, drugstore OR high end.  I haven't tried the Fit Me Matte and Poreless, but I understand the 110 Porcelain is actually lighter than in the Dewy and Smooth, so that might be a thing to try. I've heard it runs more olive, however.  I say 'prior to today' because this is Day 1 of trying out Wet N Wild Coverall Cream Foundation in Fair. So far so good! It's medium-full coverage, matte, and it dries down really thoroughly quickly but not too quickly. There's essentially no transfer at all, which is wonderful. It's maybe slightly cakier than my ideal, but not terribly so given how matte it is. It doesn't smell, and if anything at first I thought it was a little pale for my summertime skin, but it matches my neck quite well. I bet it will be perfect come winter.  I've also been using Maybelline 8-in-1 Perfecting BB Cream in their lightest shade, which is quite sheer and may be a touch dark for me but nor enough to matter given how sheer it is.  If you're very pale, you may also want to try Hard Candy Glamoflauge Foundation in Porcelain (at Walmart). It's a really interesting super-lightweight consistency which seems sort of like a whipped liquid not-quite-mousse thing; almost fluffy. It's actually really definitely too light for me. It also emphasizes my pores, but nearly every single foundation I've found (except the above three) does that, and I haven't heard of other people having that problem.  I'm NW-10 (probably more like NW-12 in summer) and very dry, for reference.  If you're looking for more products which work for pale girls (or have suggestions!), do you know about /r/PaleMUA? I find it a useful resource."

L'Oreal infallible lipstick was clearancing in my stores like crazy last year, and it was because they were changing the packaging.  If say Nyx was changing their logos or something they might change a bunch of their packaging at once.  This is what I am hoping for anyways, I love their stuff. 😟"

drugstoreMUA,3bx5jp,MsMessica,3,Fri Jul 3 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"I have really been liking NYX so far and trying a ton out, my favorites are a lot of the kinds of products others have said, the lipsticks, cream, matte, and butter, are amazing. I am still figuring out my colors, a lot of the favorites don't look quite right on me. Whipped caviar is slightly too purple for my tastes and Cannes is not quite what I'd hoped it would be (amazing color, a little too bold for me?). I have been really liking Eurotrash with Zurich on top. Eurotrash is a tiny bit brown and Zurich is a tiny bit light for me. have light-medium skin (I think according to NYX I am light-medium with golden undertones) that is probably a little too warm for whipped caviar (for my tastes). I just got the butter lipstick in pops and I'm excited to try it tomorrow during day tomorrow, it looks amazing. I want to find the correct-toned butter in a reddish color. I got the sable nude lip pencil and it looks amazing, absolute perfect color, but, it broke a bit out of the cap as I first opened it. I am super sad about that. I wish they had more sheer options and clear-cut berry tones. Your tastes are of course going to vary :)  I really like the tame and frame, love the brunette color. I am gonna try a couple other brow things. I love the eye base, I have dry eyelids and the only thing that used to work for me was the Mac painterly paint pot, but I really love the skinned-toned eye shadow base. I want to try the milk pencil too.  I love the concealer pots. The under eye concealer is ok but creases. I'm going to try the HD concealer to compare.   I love the pinched blush. Also like the HD blush in intuition, but it isn't as sheer, so definitely need a light hand.  I also LOVE the super skinny eye marker. I have tried like different black felt-tip pens recently and this is my keeper. I love this pen. I just love this pen. I also like the gel liner but I just want to use the super skinny liner. It goes on super exactly and super opaque. I wear a heavy line but I like to draw the line and fill it in with this. Great control of the liquid. Just my favorite one.  Some powders are amazing, the blushes and the matte bronzers, but some are not for me. I tried the mineral setting powder hoping for a really light-weight mineral-powder foundation but it was not what I was hoping it would be. I have had mixed results with their eye shadows -- I really like their ""love in rio"" sets, I have 4 of the neutral-toned sets (they were $3 each) and I really like using barefoot on the sand and voodoo love spells together. And they last all day at work. The white of barefoot in the sand is a bit chalky, but the others are great for me. I did not have the same luck with the ""butt naked"" palette. Great colors, went on just fine, but did not last as well all day at work."

Our skin tones sound similar, so I'll definitely have to check out the sable nude lip pencil (I can never find one that matches well!). Your other suggestions sound awesome as well, can't wait to blow my paycheck on NYX products now hahah"
drugstoreMUA,3bx5jp,WheresTibbers,4,Fri Jul 3 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"definitely their other lipsticks. i don't know if you want specific shade recommendations, but i will give them! :p i have a bunch of the Soft Matte Lip Creams; my favourite will always be Cannes. their Matte lipsticks have an awesome formula, too (most flattering shades on me are Sierra, Maison, Whipped Caviar, and Euro Trash - but yours will probably be different as we probably have different skin tones). as do the Butter, ""Simply"", and (discontinued?) Wicked and Black Label lines.  as for other products, their eyeshadows are generally chalky with poor pigmentation, so i'd advise you to stay away from those. i love their BB Cream (unfortunately, though, the darkest shade is ""Golden""), setting spray, HD concealer wand, cream blush, and Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk for an eyeshadow base. also, if you're fair-skinned, their HD Blush in Taupe will likely work well as a contour shade. and i've heard their eyebrow cake powder is pretty good!"
drugstoreMUA,3bx5jp,USB_everything,2,Thu Jul 2 22:21:53 2015 UTC,"Ooh, thanks! I'll have to check those out - A store near me recently upped their NYX game and I've been eyeing up their lip creams and eyeliners for awhile :)"
drugstoreMUA,3bx5jp,rwturner,2,Thu Jul 2 23:06:38 2015 UTC,I like the jumbo eye pencils; I previously just had Milk and Black Bean for using to prime under shadows but I just picked up Rust which is a cranberry color and it's awesome. I also love the lip pencils.

The sparkly liquid liners are actually quite nice. They don't have much of a base color, just sparkle, but it's a nice sparkle. The black liquid takes awhile to dry and the staying power is mediocre, but it goes on smoothly and is a nice black."
drugstoreMUA,3bwrb1,jsitch,3,Fri Jul 3 18:44:47 2015 UTC,About what I expected. If I didn't have better quality products and experience I'd probably use it as something to play with. I really like the Mulan shadow and blush colors though...

drugstoreMUA,3bkhw9,mommafatpimp,7,Tue Jun 30 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"No clue but that's really weird. I don't use a whole lot of NYX stuff but I peeked at their website since you said something and could pick out a whole bunch of products I couldn't find (cream blush, Wicked+Macaron lipsticks, color mascara, mosaic powders, illuminators, dewy+matte setting sprays, lots of stuff I've heard people rave about!).  A little worrying, but here (DC metro) we have a ton of independent beauty stores that carry NYX and might have the dc'ed (if it's so) stuff in backstock for ages, but they have a lot of stuff and colors that are unique for the drugstore and dupes for the longterm won't be easy :("
drugstoreMUA,3bkhw9,ughomgg,4,Tue Jun 30 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what's wrong, but it looks almost like they were redoing the site did not work out all of the kinks. The worded descriptions of colors are missing. It's... weird."
drugstoreMUA,3bkhw9,Uhleesuh,3,Tue Jun 30 02:50:01 2015 UTC,It would make sense if they are doing a huge overhaul of products. They are having a 40% off everything at all the ULTA stores in the U.S. and there is not much left on the shelves. I asked a store clerk yesterday if they were getting another shipment before the sale ends Saturday and she didn't think so.

I feel like it's more waterproof. I have black eyebrows (Asian) and I use brunette, which is a cool tone ashy colour :) Ulta is currently having 40% off NYX so it's only $4.19"
drugstoreMUA,3bh5po,feuilletons,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:17:00 2015 UTC,I've looked at that but I am concerned that because it is so liquid and opaque that it would be hard to get a more subtle and natural look.  I dont do the whole sculpted harsh lines and concealer thing and all the examples I have seen using that seem a bit drawn on I guess.  I dunno maybe I'll try it and return it to ulta if I don't like it.   Have you tried the nyx micro brow pencil? It's  supposedly a dupe for ABC brow wiz  but idk about it's  staying power.
drugstoreMUA,3bh5po,M_tridactyla,3,Mon Jun 29 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"I think if you used it with a very thin brush to make hairs (like the Pixiwoo sisters do), it would work well."
drugstoreMUA,3bh5po,feuilletons,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:17:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not into the super sculpted carved out with concealer brows either. It takes some trial to find the best way for you to apply the gel. Start with very little product on your brush and use a spoolie to blend out as you work. Seems like a lot of work but once you get the hang of it, it goes fast and it lasts. I haven't tried the micro brow pencil but I'll definitely purchase it with the Ulta sale. It's worth giving a shot! Funny enough, the wax in the ELF kit used to be my go-to brow product before I started using the MUFE & NYX gels but I didn't set it with powder. I barely use it now."
drugstoreMUA,3bh5po,scarfyjackanapes,2,Mon Jun 29 23:47:41 2015 UTC,I went to ulta and played with it in the store and I was a bit scared of the liquidiness.  I ended up buying the tame in frame in black though because the texture was really build able.  I could see it being really soft or really sharp depending on the brush I used. After the swatches on my hand dried they did not move for the rest of the until I took them off with remover!  I had no idea so many of nyx's brow products were waterproof.
drugstoreMUA,3bh5po,USB_everything,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"As tenacious as the tame and frame is, I actually have no trouble washing it off with my regular cleanser at the end of the day so if you don't want to go to the trouble of a separate remover you probably don't need to."
drugstoreMUA,3bh5po,scarfyjackanapes,7,Wed Jul 1 08:30:16 2015 UTC,"Would Maybelline Color Tattoo in Permanent Taupe be too light for you? It has the ashy base and a great consistency, maybe you can mix it with a darker powder to have both darkness and long lasting brows!"
drugstoreMUA,3bh5po,erkala21,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:00:46 2015 UTC,Yes it is too light for my eyebrows.  I could top it with powder but I would worry about the powder disappearing and leaving that taupe uncovered.

Nyx makes a potted kind which I like, but I use the blonde so I can't vouch for the coloring of the darker ones. They also have a pomade in a tube which I thought was interesting but have never tried.  EDIT: So It looks like they don't have the tube kind any more? I guess they only had it for a short time because I don't see it on the website."

It's not that much of a difference when you compare it to quality drugstore liners such as Revlin Colourstay which retail for around $11.

It definitely has a great finish and covers my pores a bit better than my others (even when I use a poreless primer with the others).  I can't speak to how well it blends if you tan a bit since I'm fairly rigid about my sunscreen use though.
drugstoreMUA,3b14z8,steenface,-7,Thu Jun 25 03:51:03 2015 UTC,I'm talking just natural tan that you would develop from the sun. You should still tan with sunscreen.
drugstoreMUA,3b14z8,kelccc,8,Thu Jun 25 04:01:35 2015 UTC,"Your skin can still get a ""tan"" even with sunscreen application depending on your skin tone. I know what you're trying to say.   ETA: Who downvoted this? No sunscreen can block 100% of UV rays. If you have a higher Fitzpatrick level where you tan easily you CAN still get a little darker, even through properly applied sunscreen. That's why it's important to not rely on sunscreen as your only method of sun protection."

drugstoreMUA,3axjth,scarfyjackanapes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:35:21 2015 UTC,"I'll check it out today, thank you!"
drugstoreMUA,3axjth,dangerstar19,3,Wed Jun 24 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"I would reccomend the NYX HD concealer in the tube. I have the yellow corrector and the one in my shade, and I love them. I haven't tried the nars obe, but I have tried the maybelline fit me which is supposed to be a dupe. The NYX one is more opaque and comes in a lot more shades."
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,moutonrose,6,Tue Jun 23 18:24:20 2015 UTC,I use Colorstay whipped! The staying power is pretty great and I don't get any oil breakthrough for at least 5 hours and then it's only on my nose. In the heat I get about the same staying power which in the summer humidity is a godsend. I highly recommend it.
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,raezura,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:30:19 2015 UTC,That's fantastic! I'm going to be out in NYC all day sunday and I don't want to have to bring all my makeup to go out later that night so I figure if I can get a good foundation that won't slide right off then I can just slap on some lipstick and touch up with powder and be ready to go!
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,theywerecones,3,Wed Jun 24 01:56:59 2015 UTC,I would recommend it. It's pretty great at oil control and has great coverage.
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,neckbracechic,3,Tue Jun 23 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"I actually just bought this a few weeks ago! I saw a post about in mua lasting a long time and figured it couldn't hurt to try. My skin is pretty oily and so I typically skip foundation if I'm going to an event because it will just slide off. I use an off brand beauty blender to apply it all over and then do my contour, highlighter, and a light mineral powder over top. Set with some setting spray and it will last for hours without sliding off my face!"
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,xxxsas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:48:24 2015 UTC,That's awesome. I cant wait to try it out!
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,xxxsas,3,Wed Jun 24 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely terrible skin. Oil, cystic acne, large pores... the whole 9 yards. I use the colorstay combination/oily (not the whipped) and I LOVE it. It makes my terrible skin look and feel great. I highly recommend it.  Edit: to add, I work 8 hours a day and the coverage is the same in the afternoon when I get off work as it was when first applied.  And also, I live in Mississippi.  Aka, the most humid place on Earth."
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,buttersunset,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:56:27 2015 UTC,omg is there really a place that has worse humidity than New Jersey?! How is the coverage of the regular colorstay? Is it super heavy or buildable?
drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,adjblair,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"It's pretty severe.  The coverage is buildable. It doesn't feel thick at all and it doesn't transfer terribly, like when giving a hug or on a phone.  I apply with a brush. It's like magic."

drugstoreMUA,3auw1z,Kikiwanderer,2,Wed Jun 24 04:23:44 2015 UTC,Colourstay Whipped is my HG for my oily-ass skin. I only have to blot once or twice a day with this which is amazing (I used to blot hourly; it was terrible). Lasts even better when I use Ben Nye Final Seal overtop.  A friend of mine raves about the Colourstay liquid as well so I don't think you can really go wrong :)

drugstoreMUA,3artsa,atouchofyou,3,Sat Jun 27 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm definitely going to pick up some of those polishes. Although, I am really annoyed at the cherry blossom stuff. Cherry blossoms are A Thing in Japanese culture, not Chinese culture, and they're not interchangeable."

drugstoreMUA,3artsa,atouchofyou,-2,Tue Jun 23 14:14:08 2015 UTC,"Still annoying. I'm not frothing at the mouth or anything, but it's annoying. I majored in Japanese Studies and it's really surprising to me that the people involved in Mulan didn't do enough research to know that cherry blossoms = Japan ≠ China."
drugstoreMUA,3artsa,kasuchans,4,Tue Jun 23 14:30:45 2015 UTC,"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2015/0405/Japan-has-China-to-thank-for-its-cherry-blossoms-says-China-video  Interesting viewpoint, though."
drugstoreMUA,3artsa,atouchofyou,-3,Tue Jun 23 15:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised that the blossoms originated in China. There was a long period of time when all Japan wanted was to be China 2.0. They were kind of like the annoying little kid who desperately wants to be friends with the popular, successful big kid. Even Japan's choice of characters for their country name came out of this: ""sun origin"" was an attempt to show how important the sun was to Japan, too, and how it made China and Japan equals. When the emperor of Japan wrote a letter to the emperor of China saying as much, China basically responded with a massive eye roll of ""who the hell is this kid?"" Even today, if you want to study traditional Chinese architecture, you travel to Japan and look at their old buildings. So Japan has a long history of intentionally absorbing Chinese culture. (Religion, writing systems (Chinese character are incredibly not suited to the linguistics of Japanese), literature, food, government systems, and, apparently, cherry trees.) But none of that changes the fact that cherry blossoms reached a much, much greater cultural significance in Japan than they did in China.  In the grand scheme of things, the marketing is pretty insignificant. I'm not going to write an angry letter to anyone about this, because I'm not even angry, just mildly annoyed. But it's kind of like using the idea of apple pie to advertise the UK's culture. Sure, they made the pie before the US, and it was UK immigrants and colonists who brought it to the US. But it's got greater significance as a cultural signifier of the US than the UK."

drugstoreMUA,3an57c,StrobesNQueens,5,Sun Jun 21 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Okay! So my receipt labelled these as ""Profusion 6 Color Eyeshadow Palettes."" However, I can't find anything that even looks like these on the Profusion Cosmetics website.  The only thing I can find is these same palettes on Sam's Beauty and Ebay, and one review from someone in Australia on Makeup Alley.  Not sure what's up with that."
drugstoreMUA,3an57c,thegraveandthegold,4,Sun Jun 21 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"Weird. The design and lettering look a lot like the NYX eye palletes (here, here, and here) but obviously these don't say ""NYX"" on the bottom corner (and NYX already has a smokey palette). It looks like that was the idea they were going for, though."

drugstoreMUA,3afedj,heatsensitive,3,Fri Jun 19 23:15:46 2015 UTC,It's elf and I'm really happy with both. I had seen the Snow White collection online but I hadn't seen any of them in person. I'm a disney junkie and a makeup addict so this was perfect for me! And the colors are really nice!
drugstoreMUA,3afedj,scarfyjackanapes,2,Sat Jun 20 04:32:30 2015 UTC,Oh MAN I've been keeping my eyes peeled for these at my local walgreens. I'm dying for the whole collection. I'm worried it won't work on me though since it all seems to be better suited to a more olivey complextion (I'm super pink and cool toned). But Belle is my favorite so I don't even care!
drugstoreMUA,3agis6,theothermoose,15,Fri Jun 19 23:36:01 2015 UTC,"I really love Wet 'n' Wild's Megalast lipstick in Bare it All. It's a great nude for medium to deep skin tones and it's very pigmented. The only downside is that it can be a bit but drying for some, but it personally doesn't bother me."

drugstoreMUA,3agis6,dangerstar19,7,Sun Jun 28 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"I like Natural Nymph from elf's mineral lipstick, but it might be paler than you're looking for. I'm fair-skinned with pink undertones and it definitely works with my coloring but is more of a Kardashian-style skin colored nude on me. You might try out something like the Revlon lip butter in creme brulee, since it's sheer. It won't completely wash out your lip color, just mask it a bit."
drugstoreMUA,3agis6,scarfyjackanapes,6,Sat Jun 20 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"I alternate between Nyx's Round Lipstick in Frappucino, Nyx's Matte in Whipped Caviar, and Maybelline's Latte Beige.

drugstoreMUA,3agis6,icolorthesky,2,Mon Jun 22 04:53:46 2015 UTC,"Came here to say Julianne's nude, it's pinky toned, rather than orange. It's actually almost the same colour as my lips so maybe it is wasted on me because it barely shows, but it's a really pretty colour, feels nice on the lips, is inexpensive and smells of palma violets if you're into that!"

drugstoreMUA,3aft5o,StrobesNQueens,4,Fri Jun 19 20:01:49 2015 UTC,That's really weird! It looks almost exactly like NYX's Smokey palette. The only difference seems to be the name/lack of logo and a few of the shades being switched around.

drugstoreMUA,3a77eb,PinkPonySwag,4,Wed Jun 17 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"If you're cool toned, I suggest NYX Taupe HD blush. It's perfect for contouring. NYX also has a cream contour stick, and if you can find the right shade, it's pretty amazing."
drugstoreMUA,3a77eb,dutchessgummybunz,3,Wed Jun 17 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"I just got the NYX Taupe HD blush and I like it pretty well. For a third NYX suggestion, I'm a fan of the matte bronzer in light. It's definitely more of a bronzer than a straight up contour, but the matte keeps it from being TOO bronzey to use as a contour. It all depends on your skin tone.  I also enjoy the bronzers in the Tarte aqualilies palette and rainforest after dark palette."

I do use an eye lid primer, which generally works well and has boosted pigment/longevity in other products, so like, what gives!?  Is it just something that will pass over time with use, like once I get past the top layer? (I've read about this happening with other products)  I really want to love this palette! (It's my first one pretty much lol) So any news from you would be appreciated :)"

Yeah, pigmentation isn't great in some eye shadows (black one for me) BUT I've realized it's just about keep adding layers of the eye shadow, do you know what I mean? I used it today and my friend loved her smokey eye and I was even amazed myself. All I did was keeping adding layers and layers until I reached a point where I was pleased with the result. If you hate the process I would understand but I think it's a good way to practice and be comfortable with colors and brushes (I think! haha)"

I didn't find it draggy at all - the tip of the pen is quite flexible. I also like the Maybelline Master Precise liquid eyeliner pens, if you wanted to give those a shot too.  As for the lipsticks, I have two, one is Infallible Red, which is probably too bright for a casual daytime look, and one called Corail Constant, which is quite a subtle, sheer and shimmery coral."

I also use the Rimmel waterproof scandaleyes mascara in the orange tube and that stays on too well- you will need makeup remover to get it off.  Brows are always the elf eyebrow duo- and i never have an issue with that moving even with Texas heat and rain!  I use a regular bb cream, like nyx with the spf 15 but when I'm outside sweating it doesn't last as long for me. A new thing I've been using is setting spray- urban decay all nighter which I picked up as a sample at sephora, that does tend to keep my eyeshadow (comfort zone by wet and wild) especially in place.

I've heard a lot though that the wand isn't user friendly.      I've been on the fence about buying it as I have the other new Cg mascara (lash bloom). Which I have to apply 5+ coats to see a difference."

drugstoreMUA,39qkpd,Womenwhokill,4,Sun Jun 14 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"Colossal didn't do it for me.     To get enough volume I have to use Cg CC, Ulta Amped lashes and then Smashbox full exposure. That's not even giving me the length I want either...    FYI I bought the Seohora Lash Stash and was unimpressed with all 5 mascaras. If that doesn't prove how picky of a lady I can be."
drugstoreMUA,39qkpd,MsSarahR44,2,Sun Jun 14 05:00:49 2015 UTC,"I bought the Sephora Lash Stash too.  They were ok, and I'll definitely  use the coupon, but I wasn't blown away by any of the mascaras either."
drugstoreMUA,39qkpd,Womenwhokill,3,Sun Jun 14 05:03:53 2015 UTC,I liked the Lancome one but it's not waterproof. So it flaked like crazy and smudged underneath my eyes.      I've used Lights camera lashes before so I knew what to expect. I love the length but volume was lacking.     The rest did nothing for me. I disliked the Josie Maran the most then the Blinc (I never liked tubing mascaras).     The SA sold me on this because she said the TF Better than Sex mascara is amazing. She wanted me to try it and I just wasn't impressed.
drugstoreMUA,39qkpd,Erinescence,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"I actually like this one, but if I apply too many coats it then clumps my lashes together.   Rolling the wand didn't work too well for me, but alternating between the short spikes and the long ones works beautifully on my lashes.  Maybe that will also work for others?"

I think I tried different things underneath, finger application, beauty blender application, and brush application, and ended up throwing it out, because it always looked really weird on my skin."
drugstoreMUA,38qoib,FierceMamaCat,2,Sat Jun 6 00:50:40 2015 UTC,"Same here. I have combo skin and it settles in lines and accentuates dry patches no matter if I use a primer or what amount of foundation I put on. I try to moisturize a lot, but maybe not enough and I could probably try another primer, but apart from that I'm out of ideas. I'm gonna check this thread because I'm curious about any tips as well. I don't wanna give up on the foundation because I haven't found a shade that suits me better and I've been looking for a while :/"
drugstoreMUA,38qoib,bereneko,2,Sat Jun 6 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"I've been doing some experimenting and today it stayed quite nicely. I used Tony Moly egg pore primer and then sprayed UD Oil Slick on top. I let it dry, then applied the foundation, then dusted a bit of translucent powder and sprayed again. It's time consuming but I like it for summer."
drugstoreMUA,38qoib,bereneko,2,Sun Jun 7 01:41:53 2015 UTC,"Came up with something, I've never done that with any foundation, but have you tried mixing it with moisturizer or something? Do you know what kind of moisturizer would be good? Plus it seems like I should invest in a setting spray, can't afford UD but I've seen some others in the drugstore so I'll make note of it next time I go there ;)"
drugstoreMUA,38qoib,PinkPonySwag,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:32:20 2015 UTC,Mixing it sounds like a good idea. I'm not sure if a certain kind would be best though. Maybe a lighter moisturizer? I'll try it! I've heard the L'Oreal setting spray is good. I'll probably get that when my UD runs out.
drugstoreMUA,38qoib,Beanpod79,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:00:15 2015 UTC,"The CeraVe PM moisturizer is super light, and generally mild."
drugstoreMUA,38qoib,misskitty5077,2,Thu Jun 11 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"Late to the thread, sorry. I bought a tube over the winter that ended up being way too light for me. And yes, the formula is crazy thick. I was using a very small amount as a concealer topped with a setting powder for a while with ok results. Recently I've been mixing it with a darker shade of BB cream to get a closer match and to thin it out a bit. I don't use it as a full-on foundation (not a fan of liquids), but it works well to spot conceal."
drugstoreMUA,38qoib,OhhBuddy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:37:22 2015 UTC,"I use the stay matte primer, foundation and powder. I use the primer then buff in a little translucent powder with the RT bugging brush. I then cut the foundation with ~40-50% primer on the back of my hand, mixing it with my brush and buff it on with downward strokes using the RT expert face brush. I start on my nose then work outward under my eyes then do my chin and forehead working out to the hairline. I cut the foundation because I like a lighter coverage but I never had the problem described here when I didn't cut it with the primer. Finally, I buff a little more powder on.   Long before starting, I wash my face, use a treatment under my eyes then moisturize. It's at least fifteen minutes before I start my makeup and then I do my eyes first. Sometimes it will be a few hours but it's always more than 30 minutes before stating on my actual face.   My normal face wash and moisturizer is fromTrader Joe's Nourish line. I use either an Olay gel or some random eye treatment sample although I do save the heavier ones for bedtime.   Note that I've never had a problem with dry skin on my face (the rest of my body is scaly lizard dry though). I'm super oily but since I went to the SM line, I rarely need to blot and then it's only after 14 hours or more. I will sometimes use Misha BB in the same manner except for cutting it with primer - I can get a lighter application with it.   ETA: I use primer to cut the foundation because I sit in the floor to do my makeup and was too lazy to get up the first time. I grabbed the primer that was convenient and it worked well enough I just kept using it."

drugstoreMUA,38ny1b,plastic_soul,2,Fri Jun 5 15:03:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed completely about the Goss method. I use NYX Studio Photogenic powder for this. It keeps my face so matte compared to any combination of products and techniques I've used in the past. I still have to gently blot a few times a day, and I finish my face with a mattifying setting spray because my skin is just an oil slick no matter what, but the Goss method has improved things drastically."

drugstoreMUA,38fh07,Womenwhokill,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:21:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation
drugstoreMUA,38fh07,Womenwhokill,3,Mon Jun 8 15:13:52 2015 UTC,"My skin has such olive undertones that next to other pale girls (I am a pale girl with strong olive undertones) I will look literally green or sick next to them. In terms of lipsticks, Coral pinks (MAC Ravishing/MAC Vegas Volt/MAC Costa Chic) look AMAZING on olive skin, and in terms of bright pinks, gear more towards red-pinks(MAC Relentlessly Red / MAC Impassioned) rather than purple-pinks (purple-pinks look really strange on me). So that means no MAC Snob or St. Germaine :(  But yeah for olive skin I can't emphasize enough that CORALS will suit you like NO OTHER!!!  When it comes to darker colors, Wine reds or berry colors will also look amazing! So think MAC Media / MAC Diva / MAC Sin will all look great. Just stay away from cooler undertones when choosing your lipstick otherwise it comes off looking like you're sick :("

You can check if yours has one (it could go unnoticed since it's small and just seems like... the end of the pencil I guess?) or buy a cheap pencil that has one, and see if it fits. I have a NYC eyeliner and a L'Oréal eyeliner (infallible something) that both have it."

It reminds me so much to Tarte's Timeless Smoothing Primer. Now, I don't have really large pores but it does help blurring mine and it feels so good on the skin. You should check it out :) - Also, have you tried to use an alpha hydroxy acid cream for your pores? Because I am and I think that's why mine are so minimal. I bought one at Walgreens from their Studio 35 line that has 8% AHAC and I've been using it for 4 months now (day and night) and my skin loves it. If you search for it, a lot of people on youtube love it and I can vouch for them. When I started using it it didn't sting at all but after a few months it did but it doesn't hurt, so don't be scared. Check it out too! Read what AHAC is all about and if you think it's something you want to try then go for it :D I hope this helps<3"

drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,sleeplessMUA,2,Wed May 27 21:46:37 2015 UTC,I came here to suggest the Nyx concealer. Either in the jar or the tube. I buy the one in the tube and I have not bought another concealer in years.
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,Special-Kwest,7,Thu May 28 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"Glamoflage is pretty good. If you have red spots, you should look for a green concealer as well. Physician's formula has a good one, imo. Edit: Physician's Formula can be bought at CVS and Glamoflage can be found at walmart.   However, if you have super-duper oily skin and dry patches? I'd suggest heading over to /r/skincareaddiction if you want some skincare help. It was a lifesaver for my cystic acne and then the leftover pigmentation."
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,ughomgg,2,Wed May 27 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks! Yes, I see a dermatologist in a regular basis and my oil production has reduced a lot (it was a monstrosity before, and I've gone from ""pizza face"" to very few pimples and a bit of scarring. Still working on the scarring with my dermo!) I'm also trying out SCAs starter routine, and this has helped a lot. I don't normally have dry patches, I just had a reaction to a concealer that I returned. Thanks for the tips though!"
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,Special-Kwest,1 point,Thu May 28 00:34:58 2015 UTC,My amazing dermatologist (took a couple of them) has gotten my cystic acne under control with two topical prescriptions (one in am/one in on) but how did you get it under control?
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,ughomgg,1 point,Thu May 28 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"I went on Spirolactone. It did wonders! I also stopped trying to make my skin submit by not using harsh products. I'm talking a benzo-scrub/face wash, cetaphil (my skin hated it) and bad moisturizer. And harsh spot treatment.   Now my routine is oil cleanse (if I wear makeup), water and a gentle cloth (microfiber), and CeraVe. I switch between the PM if I wear makeup since it plays nicer with my foundation, or CeraVe in the tub if I just feel dry. Sometimes I do a queen Helene's mint mask if I feel gross. When I had serious hyper pigmentation I was using alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic oil-free/anti-wrinkle gel and stridex redbox. But I've gotten lazier since my skin got better. I work well with barebones. If you have serious spots and use these products (or any acids) USE SUNSCREEN. You should use it anyways, but especially if you have old spots. The sun makes them worse and if you use acids, your skin will be way more sensitive to burning."
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,Special-Kwest,1 point,Thu May 28 13:48:59 2015 UTC,"I was put on Acanya for morning and Epiduo for night. I still use my scrub but only at night. I tried to stop and I broke out, so, sticking with that. However it really seems majorly hormonal and stress-based in terms of its timing. But also the medication and my dermatologist are amazing! Hehe."
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,ughomgg,1 point,Fri May 29 04:25:27 2015 UTC,"If it's hormonal, can you try birth control? Or spirolactone if you're willing. Obviously do some research if you're interested in either. Or disregard this if you aren't. :)"

drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,deathbyblackhole,7,Sat May 30 02:40:38 2015 UTC,Make sure that you set the area around your eye with powder. The oil from your skin is what's causing the mascara to transfer.
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,Cameo-Illustrated,2,Wed May 27 23:55:53 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that before. Thanks for the tip, I'll give the mascara another go after adding powder."
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,kalikooz,2,Thu May 28 00:46:45 2015 UTC,No problem! I had this problem too. Now I can forgo the waterproof mascara on occasion without the fear of panda eyes. Just make sure to powder up to your bottom waterline as close as you can get without actually pondering your eyeball.

drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,noepicadventureshere,2,Thu May 28 01:29:25 2015 UTC,I second the telescopic mascara! It separates my lashes really well
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,glaceauglaceau,2,Thu May 28 10:14:20 2015 UTC,"You could try the Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer (this stuff is great - pigmented and never creases on me) and the L'Oreal Beauty Tubes mascara (it's a tubing mascara so removes with just water and never smudges or flakes...it's the only thing drugstore I've used that hasn't done one of those two things. If you wear a coat of just the mascara end - it also comes with a primer end - it ends up looking pretty defined, but it doesn't hold a curl well so you'll neee to overcurl your lashes if you're like me and have stick straight lashes beforehand to keep them from falling)."

I have allergies and a tendency to cry at the drop of a hat, and it doesn't smudge for that either. I was looking for something natural looking but with a little oomph and this has given me that."

As another poster mentioned, definitely set your eye area with powder especially under the eyes. I actually like to use a primer under the eyes such as essence I heart stage, and apply concealer, then apply powder."

You can't go wrong with most revlon products. Since you're oily like I am, check out the Wayne goss method. It gives me great coverage without looking cakey while using less product and looks flawless all day! Good luck!"
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,st0nerp0ny,1 point,Thu May 28 06:55:05 2015 UTC,I really recommend glamoflage! Here's my results: http://imgur.com/a/rW2Gl  Since you have some dry areas on your skin I recommend using an oil free moisturizer and letting it set for a few minutes before you do you're makeup (I normally tie my hair up etc) then apply SMALL amounts of glamoflage to each blemish (it goes a very long way) and use a concealer brush to pat it and blend it out.   As for mascara I'm a big fan of L'Oréal's voluminous line and I also LOVE the Revlon Grow Potion mascaras.   I bet you'll look great for grad (:
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,att4ck_,1 point,Thu May 28 09:28:50 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same issue with mascara and to be totally honestly, a mid end mascara is the -only- thing that works flawlessly. If you decide to bite the bullet, the cheapest option for mid end is Clinique Long Lasting Lash Power Mascara. I have some drugstore options that are pretty good.  Firstly, make sure your eyelash curler is clean. If the other trick of setting under your eye doesn't work (it doesn't for me), try a different brand of mascara. I've had decent luck with Maybelline but I'd also give Cover Girl a shot. Clump Crusher is quite good. For the love of pie, don't try L'Oreal. It makes my lashes look amazing but -every- formula smudges like no tomorrow on me."
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,PinkPonySwag,1 point,Thu May 28 12:20:45 2015 UTC,"I was gunna suggest Glamoflauge as well, the only two issues are that they only have Hard Candy at Walmart (and I know you were hoping for CVS) and the color range is limited.  However I have super oily (and sensitive!) skin and it's the only concealer I've ever REALLY liked. (And it's heavy duty to say the least) Other than that I know my Rite Aid carries some NYX stuff - not sure if CVS does but their HD concealer (in a tube with a wand) is also pretty nice and I've found the coverage to be buildable, but still Glamoflauge would be my first choice."
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,Alison_Wonderland1,1 point,Thu May 28 14:40:54 2015 UTC,"Glamoflage looks like shiiiit on my oily skin. I've been using loreal infallible pro-matte and it's been beautiful. I use two faceds primer under it, dunno how it'd look without a primer. But infallible stays silky looking all day long and doesn't smear or budge."
drugstoreMUA,37i8t4,confettiqueen,1 point,Thu May 28 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"I can't say shit about concealer, but I'm a super-oily person, too, and I swear by these three mascaras:  1) The Rocket Waterproof by Maybelline.  These are big, full lashes that have very long wear.  It's a rubber-bristled brush with little bristles.  2) Lash Sensational Waterproof by Maybelline.  This ish is immovable.  The brush is odd and has a comb on one side, but works like crazy. Like, my skin, makeup remover, soap, NOTHING moves it.  I have to massage with argan oil to get all of it off.  It's a longer, lighter, lash and is more natural/fluttery.  3) Bold Lacquer by Revlon.  I'm surprised I like this, since the brush is soft-bristled (not my fave) and it's not waterproof, but it does a full day with me at work and beyond. It separates my lashes, looks long and suuuuper natural, and is undeniably the softest mascara I've ever used.  YMMV since it got mixed reviews, but I love it.  EDIT:  added brush description"

drugstoreMUA,373y0i,deadpolice,2,Sun May 24 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I like it a lot more then I thought I would. I thought it would be too dark, and I think I have light-medium skin? Its not an issue at all for me, but I apply it very very lightly and build and blend tons. If you use a lighter brush and a light hand, I think it works well. I also got the Aesthetica  contour kit for this exact reason (afraid the City Color was too dark). So far I think I like the City Color better. The Aesthetica powders seem a little dry to me, and I definitely did not use enough, I thought I looked a little pale (and skin felt dry). But I have only used it once, I need to try it at least a couple more times to know for sure. When I try the Aesthetica more, I want to write a comparison of the two... Maybe the Aesthetica is a good option for you?  I watched this video which convinced me to try the City Color (she looks rather fair): https://youtu.be/s5IELJekl6E  Here's a photo of bunch of Bronzers to the City Color. If you're comfortable with a ""medium"" bronzer, I think the City Color Contour bronzer could be considered a medium bronzer (looks about the same as the e.l.f Tan Toffee)... http://imgur.com/u092N7D  If you have any products you'd like me to try to compare it to (that I might have, you never know) let me know and I can take a picture."

I don't like a lot of mascara on my wand so I do wipe off excess, so that may be part of the lack of clumping, but I digress, I have wiped off with other mascaras before and still clumped like crazy."

I combat this by using a different water resistant mascara over it, but I think I would really like to try the water resistant one."
drugstoreMUA,36wx8l,kloudnein,2,Sun May 24 05:22:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I also have super watery eyes (thanks allergies and medication!) and I've noticed it can run a little bit but it makes my lashes look so good that I've forgiven it.

They also have a ""Lash Boosting"" formula that's serum infused (blue packaging), and a Tubing version (red packaging) that I have seen in drug stores but haven't had a chance to try and see if they're as good as the original.

I like travel size mascaras better anyways since you're not supposed to keep mascara for too long and, you can use it all up before it dries out :) The only downside is it can get smudgy in humid weather but it's easy to fix-up"

drugstoreMUA,36vtez,jessy_k1065,6,Fri May 22 14:57:40 2015 UTC,"The Organic Wear Fakeout Mascara (in the pink tube) is the only mascara I wear anymore because it doesn't irritate my eyes. Even during this horrific allergy season, I haven't had an issue with it getting in my eyes and burning or irritating them.  Pros: Definitely pumps up the thickness of lashes on me. I also like the nice fat brush and think it helps with adding thickness. It doesn't clump. And obviously, it's organic and non-irritating and a reasonable price.  Downsides: It doesn't give you the ""false eyelash"" effect, ie, a ton of length. However, I use a comb carefully and can get a great look from applying a couple of layers.  It does tend to flake when applying, so I often have to touch  up with a little remover under my eyes. Once its dry, I don't have an issue.  Basically, a great everyday mascara if you have sensitive eyes and don't need to have crazy length added."
drugstoreMUA,36vtez,I_Dont_Own_A_Cat,2,Fri May 22 15:46:24 2015 UTC,For me it does burn my eyes! I've never had a mascara burn my eyes before. I also tried the tinted moisturizer which was okay texture wise but it had a very strong chemically type smell (probably from the spf) and it also burned. I've heard such great things about physician's formula but I guess I tried the wrong things.
drugstoreMUA,36vtez,BarbieTheHedgehog,1 point,Fri May 22 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, sorry to hear that about the mascara. Maybe you have a specific allergy? As for the tinted mousitirizer, I have found that PF is generally not good for liquid skin makeup at all! They have good bronzers and blushes but the other complexion products always fall short, in my experience."
drugstoreMUA,36vtez,I_Dont_Own_A_Cat,1 point,Sat May 23 00:45:02 2015 UTC,Good to know! I only tried the TM because I bought a pack of both the TM and the mascara for $15 and thought I'd give them both a shot.
drugstoreMUA,36vtez,BarbieTheHedgehog,5,Sat May 23 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"The Organic Wear CC Curl + Care Mascara (in the silver tube) was my go-to for quite awhile.  I went through tubes and tubes of it!  I've moved on to other non-organic mascaras since then, but I still love it. While it's not waterproof, I didn't have any problems with smearing or flaking.  However, I did try the Jumbo Lash Mascara (green tube) first and it kept smudging on the inside of my glasses.  I didn't have that problem with the CC one.  In the other lines, I also have the Shimmer Strips All-in-1 Custom Nude Palette in Natural Nude.  It's for both eyes and face, so you can use it for eyeshadow, highlighter, and shimmery bronzer.  Use a light hand though, the shimmer is powerful.  A nice matte shadow is the Matte Collection Quad.  I have it in Canyon Classics.  It's a nice set of neutrals to add to a collection.  As far as prices, CVS in the US has sales on Physican's Formula ALL THE TIME.  Right now, it's buy one, get $7 back, limit on 1.  I've never spent more than $5 on any item.  They have a sale every 2-3 weeks.  (Rite-Aid does too)  I don't personally like Tati's (GlamLifeGuru) channel as much now that she's focusing on a lot more high-end makeup, but she has an older review of her favorites from Physician's Formula."

I have mascara allergies and their organic wear ones are the only mascaras that absolutely do not cause my eyes any irritation. I have used several tubes of the green mascara, one or two tubes of the brown tube with the green top and most recently got the white tube. I love that they do not irritate my eyes at all, and they give pretty good volume but they never seem to set and in the humid south that doesn't work for me in the summer. The white tube (which I think is called BB mascara) makes my lashes look amazing and would be HG status if I could get it really set for me."

drugstoreMUA,36nkhx,cat_with_giant_boobs,5,Wed May 20 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"Hello! I saw these for the first time ever seeing them today and wanted to check them out. I purchased these four for $9.98 at Wal-Mart and I believe there are 13 colors total.  There are five pictures of my lips, the first being a picture of my lips completely bare. The other four are each of these on my lips (two layers) in the following order: 002 Buffest Beige (lightest nude), 030 Miracle Mauve, 035 Iconic Iris, and then 010 Premium Pink. They are also swatched on my arm (bottom to top) in this same order as well.  All of them have sparkles in them, but it's not too much for me and I wasn't bothered by it. The staying power was surprisingly good, as they could only be removed with makeup remover. The pigmentation is true to the tube and it can layer well.  The drawback for me is that they are sticky. They are uncomfortable to wear and the stickiness doesn't dry or go away, causing me to lick my lips and feel irritated.  Overall, I do like them but I won't repurchase any others due to the way they feel on the lips."
drugstoreMUA,36nkhx,Nanya_business,6,Wed May 20 18:10:50 2015 UTC,"I have 2 of these and I know what you mean about the stickiness, it's really annoying. Try patting some translucent powder over them, it helps a lot. Still though, I don't find myself reaching for them a lot because they wear sort of weirdly over time, they get a little gummy, especially if you apply a second thin layer to get them opaque."

I own two of the Essentials line (white handled)- a spoolie (aka the brow & Lash wand) and the concealer brush.      I also like the essential custom compact because the plastic divider pops out and you can place a magnet there. Thus creating a tiny z-palette.      Back in the day (~2008ish) I made a large order from the Essential line as the Studio line didn't exist then. I wasn't too impressed by most of the products. But I know some of the Studio line ones are impressive.     Fyi: I put my brushes through a lot. Some of the ELF ones have held up through 5+yrs of torture from me.

drugstoreMUA,363a2i,doodlebug25,1 point,Sat May 16 05:56:24 2015 UTC,Their felt pen eyeliner is also REALLY good! The brushes I have found so-so.
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,ProjectCherry,20,Fri May 15 13:33:54 2015 UTC,Rimmel provocalips in Heartbreaker looks just like that on me. I'm slightly darker than Bey.
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,glaceauglaceau,7,Fri May 15 15:40:47 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I have Play With Fire and I love it so I won't hesitate to pick up Heartbreaker.
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,glaceauglaceau,5,Fri May 15 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"You'll love it! I really wish they'd expand the color line, I love the Provocalips formula so much but the color selection is so limited. I'd love to see some deep berry colors, a vibrant purple, and a deep pink.   Edit: Actually, what skintone are you? If you're significantly lighter than Beyonce, I'd recommend the Make Your Move Provocalips over Heartbreaker."
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,glaceauglaceau,3,Fri May 15 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"I am lighter than Beyonce, so I'll take your advice and swatch both before making a purchase. I checked some of the online swatches and they looks amaaazing but in-store is always better.  Oh who am I kidding. I'll probably end up buying both. They're way too nice! (Also the boyfriend appreciates the lack of lipstick transfer greatly.)"
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,eisenkatze,3,Sat May 16 04:07:51 2015 UTC,"I know! I love the formula so much.   Where do you live that your drugstore has swatches? Ours don't, you just have to take the leap and buy it. So annoying."
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,eisenkatze,3,Sat May 16 04:46:20 2015 UTC,"I live in the United Arab Emirates! All our stores have testers, and products I've heard are normally unsealed in the States are all taped up and nice :) I don't know what I'd do without testers, honestly. Online swatches look very different IRL depending on camera quality, lighting, editing...I always swatch on my hand and then see how it looks under store lighting and natural lighting before buying. That way I also get to know if I like the texture or if the color can be built up. Downside is, we don't get a whole bunch of brands :(  Are you somewhere in North America?"

Anything you'd recommend?"
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,twinkiegg,2,Mon May 18 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot from them since their sales always come at an inopportune time, but it's just interesting that it's such an obscure brand despite being American, and only shows up in other countries! I have their ""shimmering eye dust"" which isn't shimmering at all, but a super strong loose matte pigment. Difficult to work with since it stains everything if I'm not careful, but very longlasting and vivid on me! Matte pigments are life.  I also tried on several of the matte lipsticks and they were the creamiest, softest things I'd ever touched in my life, so it's interesting that you had that reaction... it's probably silicones, they feel soft but can be bad for some people. They wore amazingly on my lips though. Unfortunately the shades are too bright for my olive skin, they're beautiful but I couldn't see myself wearing them. I've never seen another lipstick with a formula like that and assumed that MAC mattes would be similar since everyone's raving about them but they're completely different... perhaps I should just decide on a color and properly try it out in everyday life!"
drugstoreMUA,3624jg,confettiqueen,2,Tue May 19 07:46:02 2015 UTC,Bright colors are totally my thing. I think I'll try one of their lipsticks again :) Thanks for the mini-review!

I just received a collection of items from Onyx Box that is sponsoring Onyx Beat. You get (5) items for $15. Sweet.    There is one particular item that's in this collection that is worth the purchase alone. This liquid lipstick by Cailyn, that is a Pure Lust Extreme Matte Tint in 'Corruptionist' brings me to LIFE!   You will get the liquid lipstick along with Mirabella eyeshadow, Revlon mascara, Cargo blush, and BB Cream/Tinted moisturizer HERE for $15 (and I have paid that much for two tubes of lipstick that don't even compare in quality to this Cailyn)  This liquid lipstick - You apply it in it's liquid form and within seconds it dries to this BRILLIANT matte finish! It is OPAQUE, a little goes a LONG way, it's not streaky, and it doesn't dry out your lips like some other matte lipsticks do. Also, it's light. I barely notice it's on - especially when I smile. So $15 deal for 5 QUALITY products, by OnyxBeat and sponsored by OnyxBox. Cheers!"

No subscription, just buy the bundle and roll with it.   But I have to say that I am CONSTANTLY on the lookout for matte lipstick that: -is not drying -not streaky -has longevity -is opaque -is light on the lips There are fewer out there than you would imagine - though I like my Ruby Kisses Drug Store brand that hits a few of these marks. For $19 to get this kind of quality (or $15 for the Onyx Beat bundle), to me, it's an investment and 100% worth it.   I would be curious if there was a dupe of this as well. I hope to see it here one day! :D  Makeupaddiction and I, are on the outs with each other. I like the community but the moderators have their claws extracted for some reason."
drugstoreMUA,35c3wl,BuffyTheMoronSlayer,2,Sat May 9 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"No subscription has me intrigued. It looks fabulous on you and not drying is great bonus.  Have you had the opportunity to wear it for long periods of time? What gets me about mattes is that they wear off unevenly and when you go to reapply, it's a complete mess."
drugstoreMUA,35c3wl,NYXaddiction,2,Sat May 9 11:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yes. The cool thing about this matte is that it blends BEAUTIFULLY with the last application.  I was wearing it most of yesterday, ate with it, and a small portion came off around the biting area (of course). I reapplied and it looked fresh!  Sometimes with mattes you HAVE to do the whole lip because the color is off from previous to reapplication. This stuff is so opaque that wasn't even a concern."

drugstoreMUA,35bol7,chaydaw,21,Fri May 8 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yay! I love posts like this! I was here a year ago and we have similar skin. I'll keep these on the less expensive side. I am also going to go way overboard, forgive me. You can also reference the HG Master List in the sidebar.   Things you should get for starters   Face primer: this makes your foundation stay in place and can do a number of other things for the appearance of your skin. For oily skin go for Rimmel Stay Matte Primer. If there are days you don't want to do full makeup, you just want to make your face not shiny, you can put on some of this primer and setting powder and you're good to go.  Foundation. Obvious use, get your face one color. Maybelline Fit Me Poreless + Matte for oily skin. Concealer for your problem spots.  Gotta recommend Maybelline Fit Me again. Setting powder to keep everything in place. Rimmel Stay Matte is an excellent value for the price. I just gave you a lot of matte recommendations and hopefully it isn't too much to dry out your skin. If it is, just play around with different brands! Blush. I recommend starting cheap here and figuring out what colors work well for you. In that light, go elf Studio Blush. It's $3.00. Good brushes. In my opinion there's no point in trying on lots of different makeup if you're not applying them correctly. If I could tell myself a year ago anything it's ""you don't need lots of fancy makeup, you need good brushes!"" If you're going for cheap the always recommended and always right are elf Studio and Ecotools. Start with (1) a larger powder brush (2) a blush brush (I like angled but that's just me) (3) a concealer brush (4) a blending brush. There are a few different styles for blending brushes. I like ones like this but you could also go for a larger one.  I just linked to all elf there but you can find their corresponding Ecotools. You can also bite the bullet and get a brush starter kit which will likely be cheaper in the long run. elf has one which is $15 off right now! Ecotools has a few different brush sets that are more themed Foundation application. I splurged to get a beauty blender ($15-20) because I think it's worth it. I really really enjoy the way this guy evens out my foundation and makes it look natural. If you don't want to go that route, then you can get a foundation brush in pointed or angled. I have no opinion on this. Baby shampoo. You gotta clean your brushes! Aim for every week. Mascara. Cover Girl Clump Crusher reigns supreme for me. You look quite fair so I really recommend you use brown mascara for everyday and reserve black for more dramatic looks.  To round out with a dewy look you could get NYX Setting Spray in Dewy.   Start there and get comfortable with everything. I swear what makes the biggest difference in my appearance is getting my complexion even. I spend the vast majority of my time on my face makeup.  When you're ready to get crazy   Lipstick.  You're going to want to spend time figuring out what colors look best for you before you buy anything more expensive. I like Wet n Wild Matte Megalast for this because they are between $1-2 and are incredible for the price. My other favorite drug store lipsticks are Maybelline The Mattes and NYX Matte.  Lipliner. To be honest, I don't use them because I don't have problems with feathering.  I use elf's professional concealer brush with whatever lipstick I'm using to line the outside of my lips.  I think NYX has some good ones. You could also get Sephora's clear lip liner which is good for all lip colors.  Eyeshadow. Probably start with Maybelline The Nudes palette to get the hang of everything. After that try Wet n Wild Eyeshadow in single and trios.  Eye brushes. I'll step off my high horse and won't give this sermon again, but I recommend starting with a crease brush, a smudge brush, a blending brush, and a C brush.  Once you're ready for more advanced looks consider getting a flat brush or a pencil brush. I know elf has a flat brush, I think Sonia Kashuk at Target has a pencil brush. Eyeliner. I use only liquid liner and like Physician's Formula Eye Booster Liquid Liner. Rimmel Scandaleyes is a good pencil one.  Getting good brows pulls your whole look together. To do this you'll want a spoolie and an angled brush. For the actual makeup some well reviewed ones are NYX Brow Pomade and NYX Brow Duo.  Contouring.  I use NYX Blush in Taupe and elf's angled blush brush, but they also have a contour brush. Highlight. Wet n Wild Reserve Your Cabana is wonderful for this. elf Shimmering Facial Whip is also incredible and retails for $1.00. Not kidding, $1.00. There isn't a hard rule for how to apply highlight, but good bets are a fan brush or a small stipple brush.    Wow. Wow. I went a little crazy but I hope that helps :) If you want a direction for lipstick/blush colors let us know if you're warm or cool toned. If you don't know look at this picture. If you look best in clothes in the top colors you're cool toned, bottom is warm toned."
drugstoreMUA,35bol7,hodiernal,2,Sat May 9 06:31:07 2015 UTC,oh my goodness. this is absolutely perfect! Thank you so much
drugstoreMUA,35bol7,hodiernal,2,Sat May 9 14:01:00 2015 UTC,"No problem! I remember how overwhelming it was trying to choose things :)  I forgot to mention eyeshadow primers! They keep everything in it's place and from smudging.  Wet n Wild Fergie Take on the Day is the best drugstore one and is coincidentally great for oily skin.  You also may want to use something that evens the colors of your eyelids so you have a consistent base.  Any cream based, skin colored eyeshadow will do this. You can use Milani Eyeshadow Pencil in Almond Cream or Jordana Eyeshadown Pencil in Continuous Almond.  If you use a primer and a cream eyeshadow you're essentially priming twice which isn't totally necessary, you can do only one if you prefer. I like having the extra staying power and even coloring."

drugstoreMUA,35bol7,KnvckleFvck,1 point,Sun May 10 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"Where are you looking? Do you want to replace a specific product? I get my NYX products at Target, CVS, or Ulta.  If you still can't find them in store you're going to have to order online.  If you order enough most places have free shipping. Ulta has NYX BOGO often and 40% off occasionally if you're willing to be patient. The other great thing about ordering NYX online is there's much more to choose from than in stores."

drugstoreMUA,35bol7,confettiqueen,1 point,Sun May 10 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"Try the company website.  There's free shipping with any $25 purchase, and if you sign up with your email, they give you a discount code for 25% off of your first order."
drugstoreMUA,35bol7,KnvckleFvck,5,Tue May 12 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"You could try L'oreal True Match Lumi foundation for a dewy finish. If your skin is oily it probably won't have the staying power that your MAC Studio fix does. You'll probably have to set it with a powder to stop it rom sliding around your skin.  I really like Rimmel's Stay Matte powder. It's lightweight and you can just dust it over your skin to help set your foundation. Elf also has a loose HD powder that is really great, especially for the price.   If you find you have to use a more matte formula to have your foundation last, you can always get a glow from other products. Physicians formula has some really nice bronzers and highlighters that can make your skin glow even over your matte foundation. Just be sure to take a brush and blend everything so you don't have harsh lines and it will look natural.    I hope that helps!"

It's not the BEST palette out there, but for just starting out, I think it's perfect. They also have another version called the Blushed Nudes, if you'd prefer a more rose gold look! I believe that's a Walmart exclusive though.   Edit: /u/captaincatbee 's post reminded me about my favorite primer! Milani has one for $6, I believe, and it's great!"

drugstoreMUA,35ctwq,asadhouse,4,Sat May 9 02:01:42 2015 UTC,"See if you have any hair/beauty supply stores near you.  They always have brands you won't find in the drugstore like Ruby Kisses, Nicka K, an expanded NYX line up, and LA Girl."
drugstoreMUA,35ctwq,frumperbell,2,Sat May 9 14:51:39 2015 UTC,"Ruby Kisses Ultra Matte pastel lipstick is GOAT esp the pale blues, which is rare to find in pastel. It is one of the most pigmented brands that I have encountered and that's including the upmarket Nicka-K Absolute line.   My dollar store sells LA Girl but it is a rarer brand. Nicka-K is a local company for us but is the most common brand I've encountered in that category."
drugstoreMUA,35ctwq,gianttribble,3,Fri Jun 5 04:43:45 2015 UTC,"I actually just found these at a local beauty supply store this week and I love them. I've tried a bunch of drugstore liquid lipsticks and these are probably the closest to the higher-end formulas I own (KVD & Stila). They dry down completely matte, little to no transfer, great pigmentation. They feel slightly 'heavier' on the lip than KVD/Stila and they don't fade evenly so you get that weird fading from the inside of the lip after eating, but otherwise, they're REALLY similar to the more expensive formulas. I haven't found them to be particularly drying but I haven't had a chance to wear them for more than a couple of hours yet...definitely give them a shot, totally worth it for the price."
drugstoreMUA,35ctwq,oopsupsideya-head,3,Sun May 10 09:22:54 2015 UTC,"BTW the colors I picked up are Rebel, Secret & Bazaar. The latter two are a breeze to apply but Rebel requires a little bit of patience. Pretty typical for a darker color imo."

drugstoreMUA,358odg,tonnabelle,3,Fri May 8 01:42:07 2015 UTC,Their customer service is generally good and consistent. In the past I had received a broken eye shadow and they offered to replace it as well!
drugstoreMUA,358odg,Cameo-Illustrated,2,Fri May 8 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"honestly speaking though, you are an excellent customer by virtue of having your order number on hand. It really does help move the process along... the number of times people say ""What do you mean you need an order number?! My name's Mary Smith and I live in Pennsylvania! This is terrible service!""   But yeah, I always wondered if people ever bought there... now I know!"
drugstoreMUA,358odg,sharkxie,2,Sat May 9 00:41:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't have it on hand when I called the first time. Automated recording told me it would speed up the process to input it at the beginning of the call, so I hung up, found it, and called again."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,StopRightMeoww,16,Mon May 4 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"I'm actually quite a fan of their eyeshadows, especially their Top 10 palettes. I have the blue and green ones. The shadows are very shimmery, but I like that look.  I'm also all sorts of in love with their Glamoflage concealer. I have yet to try the foundation just yet though."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,Ysenia,2,Mon May 4 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"I use the foundation in the lightest shade and I quite like it. It's very thin, yet covers well. I like to pair the foundation with the concealer a lot, they go so well together :)"

drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,Ysenia,1 point,Thu May 7 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"I use the concealer in extra light, so that one is definitely lighter than the lightest foundation at least by a little."

drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,anskipper,5,Mon May 4 23:26:50 2015 UTC,I like their natural eyes palette but despise the primer that came with it.
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,Raewynrh,10,Tue May 5 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"I am pretty meh about Glamoflauge-- and I hate that the name pun is misspelled-- it just seems too heavy and liquid on me. I like potted concealers better.  I have and enjoy the Birthday Suit palette-- all mattes and quite decent for the price.  1,000 Lashes Fiberized Lash Weave Primer is garbage on my lashes and just falls into my eyes, but it's brilliant to add volume to my brows before a tinted brow gel.  Brows Now! is pretty good-- I like the formula, but the packaging is kinda flimsy. I dropped it on the floor and it snapped at the screwneck. The small wand tip is easy to use, but overall I find that Maybelline Brow Drama is a better color match and sturdier, and I like its weird wand.  Fierce Effects in Adrenaline is not a great formula because it's a bit patchy but it's a unique color and looks good over a dark lipstick."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,M_tridactyla,2,Tue May 5 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"I never thought of putting 1000 Lashes in my brows! Thanks so much for the tip. I'll agree, it is useless on the lashes"

It was really drying and it broke me out like crazy. I've been meaning to try the original Glamouflage though.  Edit: grammar."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,emocanadian,6,Mon May 4 23:42:32 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend the original formula Glamoflage, the one in the squeeze tube. I have dry skin problems and I don't find it drying at all."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,Ysenia,3,Tue May 5 00:49:09 2015 UTC,"If you look at the ingredients, it's really heavy on the petrolatum (basically vaseline), so it's the opposite of drying!"
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,jocoseshrubbery,5,Tue May 5 10:28:50 2015 UTC,"i have Glamoflauge and it does an okay job, but i feel like its formula is overly oily.  their 'bronzer' in Tiki is absolutely lovely, though. it's my favourite drugstore highlighter, along with Wet n Wild Reserve Your Cabana."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,lady-darlington,3,Tue May 5 05:12:40 2015 UTC,I loved the coverage of Glamoflauge but the oily formula was a killer for me.
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,BuffyTheMoronSlayer,2,Tue May 5 14:51:25 2015 UTC,"The Plumping Serum lip gloss is my favorite product. It's not sticky, smells great, and has a slight tingle from the plumping ingredients. The other products I tried in 2009-10(?) have either been discontinued or aren't worth mentioning. I used to be quite the fan when it first relaunched."

drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,ShazamBitches,3,Tue May 5 10:35:55 2015 UTC,I really like the Glamoflauge foundation!  The formula is smooth and a little goes a long way!
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,abbeyftw,3,Tue May 5 17:07:37 2015 UTC,A friend bought me the Naturally Gorgeous palette which I like for the most part. I really like the second shadow from the right.  It kind of reminds me of a UD shadow (Smog maybe?).  The champagne shades on the left are pretty good too.  The ones in the middle are maybe a bit too warm/red for me though.  I also like the Fox in a Box boxed blush in Truth or Dare.  The name of that blush line reminds me of the Lonely Island song. :)
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,mem1003,2,Tue May 5 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"I tried Glamoflauge a while back while on the hunt for the perfect shade of concealer for me. It's okay, but I found the lightest shade to be too light and the next darkest too yellow on me, so that was kind of a bummer. I have very neutral toned skin. I ended up settling for the lighter one, which was okay for brightening underneath my eyes but I couldn't really use it elsewhere on my face. I also found it to be a really weird heavy sticky consistency that felt cakey on my skin (overall dry with some oiliness on t-zone). It also comes out runny if you don't shake it but it's a pain in the butt to shake a gel in a tube, so you need to squeeze it around in the tube which is a little awkward. But that's okay, because I've found the perfect concealer for me right after that so at least I didn't have to keep searching long."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,Nanya_business,2,Tue May 5 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"I had this problem too! I love Glamoflauge though so I use it after primer and before my foundation. This way I still get coverage, but the foundation covers so it doesn't look like a different colour than the rest of my face."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,jjanetsnakehole,2,Tue May 5 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"the regular black liquid eyeliner is amazing.  it stays like cement.  it can be difficult to apply, but its very opaque and the price is great."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,_cat_wrangler,2,Tue May 5 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"I've fallen in love with their 1000 Lashes Mascara, specifically the coloured versions.  Do you know how hard green mascara is to find?  Very.  I've got Indigo Blue and Mermaid Teal.  The baked blushes are my favourite out of all of their products though.   I'm pretty happy with the palette I just bought as well, the Top 10 in Raining Men.  It's got some gorgeous jewel tones and the price point is reasonable.  The only thing I can think to complain about is their primer, specifically the Dark Spot Correcting one.  I wanted to like it, as it did give me a bit of a glow-y finish, but it broke me out quite bad and had the oddest smell.  It also didn't do much to correct, sadly."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,Ninamaroo,2,Tue May 5 04:57:47 2015 UTC,"Glamouflage (the tubed kind) is an in-between thing for me. I love the coverage, it's great with that, but it makes my dry areas look even drier. On my oilier spots it is fine though.  The ""plumping"" lip serum lipsticks are fabulous. More of a stain really. Comfy and stay on for hours. I don't get the plumping part though, or at least I don't notice my lips looking any fuller than normal.  Really wanting to try those new eyeshadow palettes that are out - the ones that look like too-faced palettes."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,alexcampbelllllx,4,Tue May 5 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"I use the glamoflauge concealer under my eyes to conceal and brighten, because it's wayyyy too pale to use as a normal concealer for myself. I have their Eyes The Limit Eye Primer and I LOOOVE it. It reminds me of urban decays primer potion."
drugstoreMUA,34vlf4,ReservateThatRoom,1 point,Wed May 6 06:45:27 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem with the color being too light to use as a regular concealer, however I had a serious problem with creasing in the fine lines under my eyes, regardless of how well I primed and hydrated beforehand.

I tried those new ultra pigmented glosses and those are okay, I got lighter shades so those aren't as good as some others I've seen. I have the all matte shadow pallet in birthday suit which I used A LOT when those were my only mattes. I have some of their regular lipsticks which I use frequently, annnnnnd I've used the L'Oreal eyeshadow pressed pigment dupes by hard candy that are more messy, but still beautiful. Jesus, I have a lot of hard candy!"

It's not my favourite lip product but I'm not really into glosses anyways. So it depends on if you really like a colour.

Once it's on the lips and after a couple minutes its not bad, but the actual smell and feel of the application makes me hate it :("
drugstoreMUA,34jhcu,ddeevv,3,Fri May 1 21:23:43 2015 UTC,I agree. The smell can be off putting but like you said it's not so bad once on. But I loveeee the applicator! It's more foolproof imo than other wands.

It is more pigmented than any other brow mascara I've tried and I think the lightest shade would do well with ashy toned brows. It also has little fibers that thickens the brow hairs.

Because the formula thickens the hairs a little bit, it covers up the sparse areas just fine.  Unfortunately, there isn't a huge range of colors - Light to Medium, Medium to Dark and Clear.  But if one of the colors works for you (I use Med-Dark) it's a brilliant product. And it's inexpensive - I don't remember what I paid for mine, but the L'Oreal site lists it for $8.99."

I do not use that end but I use the brow mascara end because it also has fibers in it. But you can only get this one online.   My other favorite is the NYX one. It looks like my brows but tamed. It stays in place all day. In fact when I commit the ultimate sin of sleeping in my makeup, it's still on my brows in the morning. The only downfall of this product is very limited color choices.   Also it's not a brow mascara but if you want something a little more high maintenance then look at the NYX tame and frame. Again, it has limited color options but you can sculpt a perfect brow with an angled liner brush and those suckers aren't going anywhere, ever. Extremely long wearing and resistant sweat, sleep, snuggling, etc."

drugstoreMUA,3475qn,Ysenia,6,Tue Apr 28 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, when it comes to summer, I start stocking up on waterproof products and powders. I also try to keep my looks minimal and natural - powder foundation, concealer only where needed, maybe a sweep of shadow and eyeliner. Primers and setting sprays are my best friends!  I'm loving the Rimmel Stay Matte line for long-lasting products that help keep away the shine. I'm also very partial to Nyx matte setting spray. I will sing the praised of the Wayne Goss foundation method until the cows come home.  When it starts getting warm out I usually switch out my heavier lip products for glosses and balm stains. They feel lighter, and usually have less wear-off from constant water and ice tea sipping."
drugstoreMUA,3475qn,SassySandwich,3,Tue Apr 28 21:00:46 2015 UTC,I'm with you and definitely look for a great waterproof mascara first and foremost. I also just do the basics like you mention but I'm moving to the south this summer and I know I'm about to be forced to reevaluate my entire face from the humidity I will not be use to!   I have to mention that I SWEAT more than the average girl. As in I wave to somebody and I will break a sweat. I have to keep a fan on me at almost all times. (Stupid medications).  I'm interested to see what other people recommend here because I am definitely going to need it!
drugstoreMUA,3475qn,magicmsfrizzle,3,Wed Apr 29 03:10:31 2015 UTC,I've said it before and I'll say it again - the Wayne Goss method is some straight up witchcraft. Powder before foundation and the entire thing lasts so much longer!

drugstoreMUA,3475qn,sadcatpanda,3,Sun May 3 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"I use Maybelline Color Tattoo eyeshadow and Eyestudio eyeliner, which both stay on through a lot of sweating/Southern humidity. Really a fair bit of sweating, it's terrible, but after biking somewhere and going between classes all day my liner's a bit faded/bottom lid is usually a bit smeared looking if I don't check it but otherwise both are great.  For foundation I've been using Revlon Colorstay, which is OK on its own at least. It's better than BB cream for obviously sweating off."
drugstoreMUA,3475qn,frumperbell,4,Wed Apr 29 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"Around about the end of May, my skin goes from combo/oily to SUPER OILY.  It was so bad, for years I didn't bother wearing foundation; it would just melt off by noon.  Last year though, I finally found two foundations that could take the heat and humidity.    My current favorite foundation, CoverGirl's 3 in 1 is amazing.  It holds up pretty well without melting off my face until the worst parts of July and August.  When it was really disgustingly humid out, I reached for Revlon's ColorStay in Combo/Oily.  It wears like iron.  I've worn to outdoor festivals in high summer without it sweating off.  The only reason I prefer the CoverGirl is that it's a better match for my skintone.  Recently though, I've been testing out L'oreal's new Pro Matte foundation and powder.  When they say matte and long wearing, they're not screwing around.  I put it on around noon yesterday and didn't take it off until 9pm.  I looked just as matte as I had when it first went on, and while I did have to touch my concealer up after about 5 hours, I did not have to blot once.  I am very excited to try it out this summer.    Another long wear thing I'm looking forward to using this summer is Rimmel's Provocalips.  It lasted through eating for me... actually it lasted until I took it off with mineral oil.    For cheek color, powder blush over cream blush will last longer than just powder by itself.    For eyes, more often than not I just tightline because it's hot and I'm lazy.  If I really want a nice melt proof eye look, I reach for Maybelline's Color Tattoos.  They're another product that will stay put until you take it off with mineral oil."

The Loreal setting spray is fan-freaking-tastic.
drugstoreMUA,346jc2,dangerstar19,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yes! Fit me matte+poreless has withstood the test of this muggy Florida spring on my suuuuper oily skin. I also use rimmel's stay matte primer and powder, and the combination seems impressive."
drugstoreMUA,346jc2,PatientLlama,2,Fri May 1 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"I've always had trouble getting foundation to last on my oily skin, but I recently found a combination of products that has totally changed the same for me. Revlon Color Correcting primer, Maybelline Fit Me Matte+Poreless, Neutrogena Shine Control powder, and Nyx Matte setting spray.   Give the Matte+Poreless a try. :)"
drugstoreMUA,346jc2,AlyseNovetti,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:18:31 2015 UTC,I definitely second the Matte+Poreless and the Neutrogena powder!! My other favorite combo is L'Oreal True Match foundation and powder.

They sell clothes, shoes, bags, beauty products, etc.) and my mom told me it was a bad idea because I would end up paying all my money back to the store xD   Normally I have to trust my mom and family to fund my spending from birthdays and chores and such, but I think hope that once I'm working to earn my own money, it won't burn a hole in my pocket so badly."

drugstoreMUA,33xotv,kloudnein,3,Mon Apr 27 02:27:39 2015 UTC,In Ontario they only seem to carry some of the larger Elf palettes at Christmas time. :(
drugstoreMUA,33xotv,Hummingheart,2,Mon Apr 27 14:40:30 2015 UTC,I just started working there last month but I think elf products have been in ours for roughly a year. We definitely don't get the larger palettes or specialty items like the Disney palettes but we have the brushes and foundation and primers. If you're lucky your local dollarama or dollar tree may also carry them. I know the ones here have their lashes and some brushes.
drugstoreMUA,33xotv,creamcheesefiasco,2,Mon Apr 27 19:32:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  I actually just got back from grocery shopping at Superstore and did a quick walk around.  No luck spotting any elf products... I don't think I've ever seen them at Dollarama or Dollar Tree either.  I HAVE seen the line carried at Giant Tiger and Winners, but the selection is strongly lacking and hit-or-miss.  Again, I only seem to be able to find the fancy palletes around Christmas.  But I will continue to keep my eye out! =)"

drugstoreMUA,33uovf,freezethefire,11,Sun Apr 26 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"So if you're specifically looking for MLBB: Revlon Colorburst Balm Stain in Honey. It's gorgeous, long lasting and looks like your lip color (but better)."
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,aralimwastaken,3,Sat Apr 25 23:53:34 2015 UTC,"Oooohh I like that. Does it have good lasting power considering that it's a stain? I don't really mind reapplying through the day, but I'm just curious.   Thanks for the suggestion!"
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,speaksincolor,2,Sun Apr 26 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"I consider it to be fairly long lasting. My lips are notorious for -anything- long lasting to rub off in an hour or two (even lipsticks touted as having amazing staying power). I think I get around 4 hours out of it without paying attention to maintaining it at all (and drinking as well). And that is a huge achievement for me personally. On a normal person, I'd imagine it lasts longer.  The one drawback is that it's not quite matte. When it's freshly applied, it has a -slight- satin finish. When just the stain remains, it's matte. You could probably blot off the finish if it bothered you. Honestly, it looks natural freshly applied or when it's been on your lips for a few hours."
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,Womenwhokill,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:35:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't mind a satin finish, really. I just didn't want like a gloss or a shiny balm. Thanks for the tips!"
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,cicadaselectric,3,Sun Apr 26 11:28:36 2015 UTC,The Jordana dupe balm stain in Honey Love is really good too! I think I might prefer it to the Revlon one.
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,lasttoast,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:18:24 2015 UTC,Is the Just Bitten Kissable different as in different formula from the Colorburst one? I was wondering if I should get it since I have the former (and like)
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,marashade,1 point,Fri May 1 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"Revlon originally released the just bitten kissable balms that had balm on one end and stain on the other. Then they discontinued those and released new ones as a 'balm stain' with just one side - this is what honey is. THEN they released the colourburst matte balms and lacquer balms, which aren't stains but look the same (crayon packaging). THEN to the best of my knowledge they changed the name of the just bitten kissable balm stains to the colourburst balm stains. So it depends what you have right now but the colourburst/justbitten kissable balm stains are the same formula, just different names, however the colourburst matte and lacquer balms are very different formulas! Hope that helps."

drugstoreMUA,33uovf,mhsrq82,2,Sat Apr 25 23:06:56 2015 UTC,The first thing that came to mind for me was the Jordana ones. I think there's even a shade close to OPs lip color.

drugstoreMUA,33uovf,ProjectCherry,4,Sat Apr 25 23:22:25 2015 UTC,"I have antwerp, and I love it! I actually looked at Zurich yesterday in ULTA thinking it might be a match, but the bottle looked a little to brown, and there wasn't one already open (I'll swatch on my hand if they're already open, but I never open them). I looked at a few swatches of it on google and they all look like they'd be a really good match. Plus, I love sheering these out over lip balm. It's like two colors in one. Thanks for pointing me towards the right shade!"
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,ProjectCherry,2,Sun Apr 26 01:07:12 2015 UTC,Cannes might also work. I have both that and Stockholm and Cannes is more pink and a little darker.

drugstoreMUA,33uovf,ProjectCherry,3,Sat Apr 25 20:46:33 2015 UTC,"Those specific shades look a little off (the first too light and the second and third too dark), but you still led me in the right direction. I found one in that line called pinkerbell that looks pretty close. Thanks!"

drugstoreMUA,33uovf,tabemasuuu,3,Fri May 8 03:45:59 2015 UTC,ELF Studio Mineral Lipstick in Pouty Petal or Runway Pink may work for you! The website makes the colors look glossy but the finish on skin is more matte. Or their Studio Matte Lip Color in Natural.
drugstoreMUA,33uovf,horse__tornado,3,Sat Apr 25 23:06:43 2015 UTC,"I just bought their studio matte lip color ib coral because it was more muted than the other lipsticks I own, but still a different color.

drugstoreMUA,33ir5d,MrsExplosive,2,Thu Apr 23 02:52:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing these are brand- spanking new to Walmart Stores; I've been looking to buy one locally for forever. I went into Walmart and saw all of the displays were new and saw the foundation!

drugstoreMUA,332tyy,momsgotink,4,Sun Apr 19 00:02:31 2015 UTC,I would look into some of the Asian brands. The Skin79 bb creams are pretty popular and if you're pale with yellow/pink undertones then the bb creams will oxidize nicely to match your skintone. However if you're NC25 or higher it might end up looking a bit greyish so you'd have to balance it out with some powder or bronzer. They're a little more expensive than drugstore products but the beauty is that you can buy samples to try out before you buy the full size (depends on the website).

drugstoreMUA,332tyy,spiderman_with_a_sub,2,Sun Apr 19 02:53:14 2015 UTC,"I actually had the same problem! I'm quite pale as well and with a cool skin tone, so finding BB or CC creams that weren't orange (or prone to turning orange) was exceptionally hard. But I've found that the Bourjois CC Cream in Ivory really suits my skin tone well. It's a bit on the yellow side, but not in a way that's noticeable on the skin at all. Which is quite odd for me, as I've always had to buy foundations that were specially designed for cool skin tones (like Tarte's 12 hour one). But this product is delightfully different. It blends very well, looks quite natural, and has never oxidized on me. My skin also tends to be a bit blotchy and red, and it does a wonderful job at covering that up. I do still need concealer for the major spots and the incredibly red areas, but never an excessive amount.  I'm not sure if this is drugstore, as I'm from America and it's an English brand, but it's sold at Boots, and I think that's basically like a drugstore over there. It's a bit on the higher end of drugstore prices at $18, but I've really found that it's worth it.  Definitely look it up on google images. There was one girl who must have been as pale as snow, and it looked lovely on her.  I hope this helped!"

drugstoreMUA,332tyy,Kentorrr,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"Like others are saying, powder before foundation with a mattifying powder like Rimmel stay matte. But before powder and after moisturizer has had a chance to sink in, wait a few minutes and thenblot the heck out of your face with blotting papers. The best I've found are the blue clean&clear ones. And then blot periodically throughout the day too, I believe us the oil that's causing oxidation on your face. Try moisturizer that doesn't have chemical SPF in it, I feel that helps make skin greasy. Look for a light moisturizer with physical sunscreens or use a powder sunscreen. Physicians formula makes a good powder one. I also think that bb creams often make skin greasy because they're so moisturizing, so I think stick with mattifying foundations."

drugstoreMUA,332tyy,CaptainCatbee,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:13:47 2015 UTC,I was going to try the cushion actually! What didn't you like about it?
drugstoreMUA,332tyy,chocolatechoux,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:17:24 2015 UTC,"The application was a lot more patchy and the color is much more yellow than the bb creams (I have swatches here). I used the cushion applicator for the perfect cover and it worked like a dream, so it seems like there's just something off with the formulation. Maybe it's just disagreeing with my moisturizer or sunscreen, since it swatches on my arm just fine. Sigh."

I use Etude House's BB cream Blooming fit in the lightest shade and it fits me PERFECTLY. Honestly I don't blend into my neck often because it fits me that well. It stays well and gives me that nice shine everyone wants. It's not orange either and I love it! A little goes a long way, you can try samples before buyung a full tube :)"

Also, to put in my two cents- I also own Rock On Ruby (and a bunch of other shades in that collection of lip stains), but I don't wear it by itself. I wear it underneath other red lip products to make wear go smoother. I find that if my lips are sheerly tinted red underneath a red lipstick, wear is a little less obvious and it helps me get away with eating fries while wearing lipstick. I also like pairing it with tinted balms- then they appear to have the opacity of a lipstick but still have the hydration of a balm."

drugstoreMUA,32x766,jikajika,2,Fri Apr 17 13:43:45 2015 UTC,"For any black outlines, I used: Wet 'N Wild's gel eyeliner or Maybelline's Kohl Eye Pencil, but any regular eyeliner pencil or gel eyeliner will do. On some spots like around my eyes, and lips, you want to use a gel eyeliner because the pencil will pull at the skin, not giving you a nice clean line.   For the inside of the eyes (starting from the outer corner) I used:  Black from MAC's Bleuluxe palette, then Ruby Kisses Tropical Paradise, and my favorite eyeshadow, Maybelline's Color Tattoo Pure Pigment in Never Fade Jade.  Color Tattoo is one PIGMENTED eyeshadow for about $5 at any of your local drugstores and a little goes a LONG way! :)  Afterwards, blend baby blend! I used the same color palette on my forehead and chin. The outline under my cheeks, I just blended together the Ruby Kisses and the Mac black to achieve that color.  Also, brushes kind of matter for this, well, two brushes really matter.  I purchased two Elf brushes from the Dollar Tree (!!!), one was a Smudge brush and the other a Blending brush.  You know what to do with the Blending brush, but the Smudge brush was great for applying the black on the outer corner of the eye and for accuracy in general. So if you don't have those two brushes, now you know where to get them CHEAP!  And that's it! Cheers!"

I performed spoken word tonight, so I decided to go all-out by pairing this neon lip with a purple smokey eye with metallic bronze and turquoise liner. I got a lot of compliments on it, and one girl told me that it looked like what people do for YouTube tutorials.  This product felt sticky as it went on and before it set, and it still felt a little sticky later on, but less so.  The wear was really great, though.

The trick is patting the foundation on. With a brush I will do a layer over my entire face and then dot more foundation on my red areas and tap with my fingers.
drugstoreMUA,32qk0d,BasorexicPoltergeist,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:06:45 2015 UTC,I have a lot of redness and I use the L'oreal Magic Anti-Redness Correcting Primer. It covers almost all the redness in my face. It doesn't look cakey. The green color blends away completely so it can be worn alone. I have tried various foundations over it and it works well with all of them. It's also really lightweight so it feels like there is nothing on your face.   I use only this primer and concealer when I'm really in a hurry and it makes a big difference. The only downside is it has a tiny bit of shimmer. The shimmer isn't too noticeable. I can't see it at all after I put on my foundation. I wore it for a month and didn't even realize it was in there. Then I wore it alone and went out in direct sunlight.   Edit: If you only have a few red areas you want to cover a green concealer would probably be better. If you have redness all over your face a green primer would probably be best.

This product was my first wearable red, so I have a special place for it in my heart. It’s not a great product, though.  It goes on pretty wet, and feels thick. When you blot it, though, that lifts most of it off. It then feels fine, but it’s so sheer that it looks entirely different than when you apply it. The color is still nice, just very different.  The wear on this is terrible, though. The after picture was taken only three and a half hours later. To be fair, that did include eating, but still, the pigment is almost completely gone.

I love how bright and cheery this color is. It looks really pretty and it feels nice, too. The formula for this lipstick is great.  It didn’t transfer too much, which was nice. The wear was pretty good, though nothing to rave about. The after picture was taken about then and a half hours later, which included eating.  Overall, there’s really not too much to say about this product. If you’re looking for a super bright matte/semi-matte pink, this is a solid option."

I absolutely adore this color, so I knew I wanted to save this for a day when I’d need a pick-me-up. Purple is my favorite color, and this is my only true purple lip color.  I am a huge fan of this lipstick. It goes on really well, the color is gorgeous and super fun, and it lasts for a while. I know it doesn’t look like it from the after picture, but I took that almost eleven hours later, which included plenty of eating. I’m fairly impressed that there’s even that much pigment left.  The one thing that bothers me about this lipstick is that it transfers to everything. The transfer doesn’t seem to diminish the color much, but if anything brushes your lips while you’re wearing it, that thing will have a swipe of purple on it, even long after you apply it.  Overall, I’d highly recommend this product, as long as you can be careful about not touching your lips."

The lines between the swatches are the liquid eyeliner in Hunter Green. The lipstick/glosses are inconsistently pigmented as the Vamp is really sheer in both products and Warm Berry is nicely pigmented in both products and Iris has good pigment in the lipstick but uneven in the gloss. My lips didn't dry or flake so that was nice. It's not a long wear product but I like having the gloss attached to refresh during the day.    The eyeliner had a bit of a learning curve with the applicator handle. It's not a brush but a pointy plastic nib. It's long wearing (5:30 AM until I removed it at 8:30 PM) without flaking. And it's a real dark green and not sad greenish black."

I had a job interview today, so I needed something that I knew would last. Naturally, I went with a lip stain.  I originally bought this product because of an entertainingly aggressive post I saw on Tumblr, and it definitely lived up to the hype of that post.  The one downside is that you have to wait for it to dry with your mouth wide open for quite some time. However, I compensate for that by applying the stain before doing the rest of my makeup, then doing my makeup while it dries.  I love this bright, shiny pink, but I’m also very interested in getting this stain in different colors. I don’t use this nearly as much as I should, and I think part of the reason is that I don’t have many chances to wear a bright, shiny pink for 24 hours.  It did fade a little, but that was after more than 12 hours of wear, which included eating and exercising.  Overall, I’d highly recommend this product."

drugstoreMUA,326lah,StrobesNQueens,-1,Sat Apr 11 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"Product List   L’Oreal Paris Colour Riche Lipstick in British Red (350)   My Review (from my Tumblr)  20 Lips in 20 Days – Day 13 – Thursday, April 9 – British Red  For the thirteenth day of my 20li20d challenge, I used L’Oreal Paris Colour Riche Lipstick in British Red.  Given that I had a quiet Thursday night in, I used my least-favorite lipstick. I originally bought this for use in theater, because the director at my high school required all girls to wear red lipstick onstage.  This fire-engine-red is unwearable for me. It’s too bright, and I always feel like a clown (unless, of course, it’s for a costume/performance).  The wear, however, is pretty great. The after picture doesn’t reflect it that well, but after almost eight hours, which included eating and exercising, there was still noticeable pigment left.  Basically, I wouldn’t wear this around, but I’ll always wear it onstage.  Also, sorry this is so late! I’ve been pretty busy."
drugstoreMUA,323c9b,mierehl,5,Fri Apr 10 06:14:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe try the foundation without primer?    Personally, I have better luck using a mattifying finishing powder over long-wearing foundations; primers have never worked for me with ColorStay, KVD Lock-It, or any of my other long-wearing foundations."

I've noticed that it's really difficult to spread the foundation in certain areas because of the matte primer, so I use the Revlon Photo Ready primer over top of it. It's a little bit thicker, so it's more slick (if that makes sense). I think the combination of the two keeps my makeup in place pretty well without separating."
drugstoreMUA,323c9b,misscolorjunkie7,2,Fri Apr 10 10:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I had a little bit of a harder time spreading the foundation after the primer. And I did have my eye on the Revlon Photo Ready, I'll test that one out when I get a chance. Thanks for the input!"

But I'm glad I helped out some how.     I'm very big on drugstore products and using them over ME or HE products (partially due to my teeny tiny makeup budget). The only products I use that are ME are those I can't dupe (BM hydrating veil) or those I had dupes for but the drugstore brand stopped making it. For an example I used Hard Candy Undercover concealer instead of MAC Studio Finish. I haven't found a replacement dupe so I'm still using the MAC product.

Nyx Powder Blush in Flamingo is similar, but also looks to lean more pink.

drugstoreMUA,31s21r,ScoutFinch12,3,Wed Apr 8 04:32:24 2015 UTC,"Yup. Swipe it on your cheek and/or finger and pat and blend with your fingers. I don't have any problem with it smearing anything as they are very creamy and blendable, but I also do not wear a heavy foundation. If it feels to heavy you can blend it out with your foundation brush or sponge that has the leftovers still on it. I know most people that use cream blush in pots use a stipple brush to dip and apply, but I don't think it is necessary with the sticks."

It fills my brows without darkening them too much and doesn't smudge. Only take a a little product. Here's a pic after I applied it then took a nap."

For reference, I use the NYX Cake Eyebrow Powder kit in Blonde, but mostly use the darker shade in that.   I LOVE it! It looks extremely natural and I don't find it difficult to use at all.  The color isn't too warm or too dark, though if I run through my brows a few times with it they get very Cara Delvigne-ish and slightly too dark for me.  I run the brush through opposite the growth pattern first and then brush the hairs into the shape I want.  This is by far the most natural-looking thing I've tried that still makes my brows look fuller and more even.  The finish on the brows is matte, not shiny."

I picked up some Wet N Wild lipsticks today since Rite Aid is having a sale. I got Mauve Outta Here, In The Flesh, Ravin Raisin, Spiked with Rum, and the liquid in High-pitched Wine. Plus I got single shadows in Brulee and Nutty.  I bought three of the Milani Bella eyeshadows. I haven't used them yet but they swatch beautifully.   I decided to try a Bonita Velvet lip Cream. It's a pretty color but it smells horrible. This is coming from someone not usually bothered by the scents in cosmetics. It smells so bad I'm thinking about returning it.  I bought one of the L'oreal Infallible Pro Matte glosses. I loved it so much I got two more. I wouldn't call them matte more satin but gorgeous and a lot more long wearing than I expected.   I bought the Nyx Tame and Frame, Dark Circle Concealer, HD eyeshadow base, and soft matte lip cream in Prague. I got the Tame and Frame too dark, should have returned it. I like Prague. It looks better and lasts longer than the other matte cream I have. I didn't like the Dark Circle Concealer. It creases pretty quickly. Oh and the Intense Butter Gloss in Toasted Marshmellow. It's absolutely gorgeous. I really like the hd eyeshadow base. I didn't expect it to be this good.   I tried two of the Rimmel London Provocalips and love them. I also picked up one of the new L'Oréal version. I love the color (Neverending Nutmeg). It's my favorite atm but it doesn't last as long as the Rimmel version. It is also harder to apply and takes longer to dry. Once you baby it on and let it dry it looks nice. It feels heavier on the lips than the Rimmel.   I bought the Rimmel Lasting Finish with comfort serum and the Radiance BB cream. I was very disappointed in both these products. Would not recommend either. Picked up one of the Rimmel Color Rush Balms in Sun Kissed. I've only swatched it on my lips but like it so far.   I picked up the Maybelline Illegal Lengths mascara and the Super Stay concealer about a week ago. Haven't opened the mascara and love the concealer. Also an Eco Tools blush brush. I've been using to blend rather than apply because it's a bit wide.   I got a Maybelline Matte in Mesmerizing Magenta. Love these and this shade is beautiful. Maybelline Rebel Bloom in Orchid Ecstasy and Lilac Flush. Plus the  L'oreal Magic Lumi Primer. Love the rebel blooms but OE is pink instead of purple on my lips. I like the primer, it gives a sheen instead of a shimmer.   I didn't realize I'd bought this much drugstore stuff over the past few weeks!  I almost forgot the Revlon lipsticks in Va Va Violet and Violet Frenzy. I like va va but violet frenzy has too much shimmer for me. Now I'm really done."

It's actually a really decent TM, the coverage is pretty much nonexistent for heavy spots and discoloration, but it evens things out just enough for me to be comfortable putting a touch of concealer over my darker marks and leaving it at that. It has a lovely finish, described on the package as ""radiant"" and I fully agree (I've got dry skin, so YMMV), it has no discernible smell, the price is great for what you get (40ml for around $6)   Doesn't seem to oxidize either. The version available in the US claims to have SPF 15 in it, while the Canadian version (the version I have) doesn't boast this, but they seem to have the same ingredients, so I think it's fair to assume it also does.   I'm pretty happy with it, and if it's good in the long run, I'm going to repurchase."

drugstoreMUA,31s21r,Womenwhokill,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:46:51 2015 UTC,I have issues with foundations and concealers caking on me.     I find the L'Oréal Pro matte just okay. I'll probably use it up and move on to whatever new one they'll be pushing. I haven't found a foundation yet that I like enough to keep around for at least a year. As for the Master Conceal cakiness was my issue. I'm sure if you don't have issues and with products being cakey then it'll be fine for you. I didn't like the Wet N Wild one because I couldn't get it to set (similar issues with Hard Candy Glamoflauge).     I use MAC Studio Finish concealer in NW20 and then Maybelline age rewind in brightener over it. I'm still in a hunt for a dupe for the MAC concealer.

I was pretty lazy today, so I didn’t actually wear anything but the lip crayon. I decided to just go with a nice, subtle red. I love this color. It’s one of my favorite reds.  When I put it on, it felt kind of wet. Two hours later, it still felt kind of wet. It really didn’t feel like this product set at all.  Considering that, the wear is surprisingly decent. After about six and a half hours, which included eating and working out, there was still a little pigment left (although you can’t really see it in the after picture). That’s not all that impressive, but with the texture of the product in mind, it was pleasantly surprising.  Overall, I’d recommend this product. It’s a great red if you want to look nice, but in a casual way."

I had some freedom to experiment with my makeup a little today, since I put it on in the late afternoon, so I did a heavier contour and more obvious blush than I normally do, as well as a gold and copper eye. I think it turned out really well and pairs very nicely with this lip color.  This is my first time using this product, and I really love it. The color is such a gorgeous, rich red. I love this balance of bright and dark.  The formula felt a little dry at first, but the second layer didn’t feel that way. Once it was on, it felt light and natural.  The wear, however, is pretty bad. Most of it came off while I ate, and some of it ended up elsewhere around my mouth (eating a burrito, some spots where the lipstick touched then touched other parts of my face or my hands). This is basically the opposite of transfer-proof.  Overall, I’d highly recommend this lipstick, but not if you need anything at all to touch your lips."

It'd dry out on me and do this weird pilling up when I did my brows (I even bought a 2nd pot of Dipbrow and the ABH #12 brush to get it to work). Which means that I'd get super concentrated Dipbrow in places I wanted lighter strokes and vice versa. It was so hard for me to work with. I tried adding Argan oil to one and it just made it an oily mess. The other I just don't use ATM.       The NYX Tame & Frame just glides on, lasts all day and looks more natural than Dipbrow on me. I can do my brows in about 10 minutes max (on a bad day where I can't makeup). With Dipbrow it'd take me 20 minutes minimum on a good day when it decided it wasn't going to be as fussy. I don't feel like there's as much of a learning curve with this stuff.     I own the Dipbrow in shades Medium Brown and Dark Brown. I own NYX Tame and Frame in Espresso.     Edit to add: I can do swatches but can't guarantee you'll get a decent picture. My phone's camera is a POS.

drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,asadhouse,24,Sun Mar 29 20:50:26 2015 UTC,I'm definitely interested in drugstore skincare tips!  I don't have a budget to try all kinds of high-end products that will work for my sensitive skin!
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,Caitir,13,Sun Mar 29 21:17:33 2015 UTC,I'm interested in drugstore skincare as well. SCA has great information but some products are out of my budget. I wouldn't mind if people asked about skincare in this sub as well as make up.
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,LuLusiPad,13,Sun Mar 29 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"I know SCA is kind of up in the air right now, but it still had some of the most useful sidebar links in regards to your question. I have a mostly drugstore budget as well, and the product reviews on beautypedia. com have been the most helpful thing ever.   Take the reviews themselves with a grain of salt since beautypedia is owned by Paula's Choice, but it's a great guideline to help you decide which drugstore products are worth looking into. You can even get brand overviews.  90% of my routine is cheap-ish, especially considering I spent a couple months building it up, so I didn't lay down a ton of money at once. Started out by finding a Cerave moisturizer I like for my body. Then came across Alpha Hydrox selling for $12. Bam, got a decent AHA product right there. I knew I'd need a great sunscreen to accompany the AHA and decided to splurge on the Olay Pro-X spf/moisturizer. It was okay, but considering the high price tag I decided to try the Olay Regenerist version instead. Holy shit, I love that entire line of product.  Olay Regenerist also offers a decent AHA that I enjoyed as a night serum before falling in love with Alpha Hydrox's stuff. Neutrogena is another brand that has a lot of great products. I use their gentle cleanser and anti-wrinkle night cream (which is a great/cheap option to add some retinol in your routine.)  Even products like vitamin c serum and BHAs have a wallet friendly version. Plenty of skincare addicts love stridex in the red box. I personally love Paula's Choice bha products; decent value for the amount and quality. As for vitamin c serum, you can actually make it at home!   There's no reason skincare has to cost a fortune. You can build a really solid routine for cheap just by taking it slow and weighing your options."
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,Earl_E_Byrd,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:12:12 2015 UTC,"I recently bought Paula's Choice 8% BHA, if you don't mind me asking, what are your personal results with Paula's Choice BHA products?"
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,sarahzot3,2,Mon Mar 30 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"BHA is usually a term used when taking about salicylic acid. If you've got a product from PC with 8% of anything, it's probably glycolic acid, not salicylic, and would be considered an AHA instead.   Usually you don't see daily-use BHAs sold with anything over 2% because it'd function more like a chemical peel than a daily treatment. That being said, I use Paula's Skin Perfecting 2% BHA every morning and I've definitely seen improvement. Some old blackheads on my nose finally surfaced and cleared out, I no longer get random whiteheads from clogged pores (although I still get hormonal, cyst pimples from time to time) and the enlarged pores on the apples of my cheeks look much more shallow these days.  All in all I'm really happy with it and will probably stick with PC as a source for my BHA. I paid $25 or so for my bottle and after almost 2 months I still have half a bottle. Worth the price for me, hopefully it works well for others too."
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,Earl_E_Byrd,3,Mon Mar 30 00:32:47 2015 UTC,I just looked at the bottle and realized it's 8% AHA gel. Ha. I feel like an idiot. Thanks for the reply!
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,sarahzot3,2,Mon Mar 30 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"Andalou probably makes the cheapest serum that's packaged properly. You can find it at whole foods for sure. I think it's a little oily, but I don't care so long as I'm using it before bed. Then I wake up with nice, plump cheeks :D  But if you're gonna go to whole foods you might as well just buy a big jar of crystallized vitamin c (usually ascorbic acid?,) glycerin, an opaque pump bottle, and distilled water. Check Google for the exact mixing measurements (cuz...ya know, you're playing with acid) and storage advice, but with those few supplies you can mix yourself fresh batches for months and months!"
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,Earl_E_Byrd,2,Thu Apr 2 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"Vitamin c crystals and powder can be found plenty of other places! Check anywhere with a big pharmacy or vitamin section :) As for Andalou, yah, that's one of the only places I've noticed it on the shelf. Might be elsewhere, but I wouldn't know where to send you."

drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,herMUAaccount22,7,Thu Apr 2 17:32:32 2015 UTC,"I have found that the cleanest drugstore products, ones with the least amount of scent, extras, etc are the best. Cerave, Cetaphil, Eucerin are facial care brands I love. I use Thayers witch hazel (more like found at whole foods then a drugstore) And Stridex alcohol free pads are my chemical exfoliant when I need something stronger.  A big skincare lesson for me was understanding that your facewash doesn't remove your makeup. Once I figured out I needed to use a remover first I had significantly less breakouts. Breakouts I was attributing to bad products that were really just me not cleaning effectively. Do this and it will open up a lot of drugstore product options for you."
drugstoreMUA,30qgr4,idabakedacake,5,Thu Apr 2 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"The drugstore skincare recommendations from /r/skincareaddiction are usually   CreaVe Moisturizing or foaming cleanser Stridex maximum strength (in the red box) or Alpha Hydrox 10% AHA Creave or Cetaphil moisturizer in the tub.   I've been using this for about a year and it's been working well. I have no desire to ""upgrade"" to more expensive products. In fact I just got some samples of clinique moisturizers and I find I don't like them as much as my $10 CeraVe.   I've also found to great masks. Not sure if they're ""drugstore"" strictly, but I found them at walmart.   Freeman Charcoal and Black Sugar mask, hands down one of my favorite masks. Leaves my face feeling so great.  The Queen Helene mint julep masque - I don't use this as much now that my skin is clearer and less greasy, but it's a mud mask so it's great for pimples and oil."

I just tried searching ""drugstore"" in a bunch of skin/haircare subreddits and the results were very scattered, so I'd love to see this thread build up.  My personal recommendations:   There's usually, almost always, sticks of 100% cocoa butter in drugstores and groceries. They may be in the ethnic care sections, but they're like $1 or $2 each! I apply them at night for toning and smell like a chocolate bar going to sleep. Neutrogena's Body Oil (~$9) is fantastic for showers or general moisturizing. I have very dry skin, so regular lotions don't cut it. I use this stuff as lotion, a shower moisturizer, and massage oil. Sometimes I mix it with Vitamin E oil for scars. It also serves as a makeup remover for stuff that doesn't come off easily. I use Burt's Bees facial cleansing towelettes for when I travel/when I'm on the go. Very mild and refreshing and removes makeup. Oscar Blandi's dry shampoo is $11 for a small bottle but lasts you forever and works/smells better than most other drugstore dry shampoos I've tried. Zum Mist Sea Salt Spray ($10, found in health food stores?) doubles as a room refresher and beachy wave spray because it's all natural oils and ingredients. It smells lovely.   I'd love a recommendation for a hair repair masque on the cheap!"

I've been using Squalane oil (~$10/ounce) and it works for me. Then I use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer sunscreen (I've found the two packs at Ulta then use the $3.50 off of $10+ coupon). I occasionally will spray my face with the Mario Badescu Face spray ($7 for 4oz) too to help.      I need to add an Aha and vitamin C serum to my routine."

I prefer it to the UD ""All Nighter"" spray - doesn't make my skin feel tight but does a great job of locking my makeup in place. PSA - if you go to Mario Badescu's website and fill out the questionnaire (I'd link, but the Mario Badescu site isn't accessible from my work internet), they send you a whole slew of free samples a few days later which correspond to your skin type/concerns from the questionnaire!

I've added some higher end anti-aging skincare, but that's optional depending on your budget. I know we're not suppose to mention age here, but I have added more products as I've gotten past my party years.   Olay Regenerist Cream Cleanser (morning) - this is my exfoliater, even though it says it's a cleanser. I'm not sure I'll repurchase it, but I like it enough to finish it. 10% benzoyl peroxide treatment (morning) - this can be used as a spot treatment or I use it all over my face for a treatment. Be careful with this as benzoyl peroxide can be really drying on the skin. Also be sure to use SPF. Eucerin Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 (morning) waterproof liquid makeup remover with waterproof makeup remover wipes to remove my makeup.  Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser - Creamy Formula - I use this to remove my makeup. I do have a Clarisonic which I know is an investment, but it's totally worth it.  Oxy 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Face Cleanser (evening) Lumene Bright Now Vitamin C moisturizer (night)   I also use the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch sunscreen on my face in the spring and summer months.  I recently heard a makeup artist say that layering your SPF isn't always the best option. That you should choose the product with the highest SPF and make that your priority, not sure how truthful that is.  Not drugstore, but I use Mario Bedescu Hyalauronic eye cream and the Dermadoctoc Kakadu C 20% vitamin serum.  Edit because my reply posted before I finished."

drugstoreMUA,30nt4x,Mahtiggah,4,Sun Mar 29 05:00:37 2015 UTC,The smokes palette is exclusive to walgreens/boots locations.
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,DrSassyPants,6,Sun Mar 29 06:16:37 2015 UTC,"I have it and I really like it! It's become my daily brow product, and I use it more often than my ABH tinted brow gel (I find the wand is way too big) and the Dipbrow (needs some time, takes some effort). The Brow Drama is quick and simple. I will say that I have pretty full brows naturally, so it's fine for me, but those with sparser brows may want something else."
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,MyLittleLabMonkey,3,Sun Mar 29 06:49:55 2015 UTC,I have mildly thick brows. They aren't sparse but I don't want to say thick. The product seems to fill them in a bit more but I can't seem to get it to do that on my tails. Like it doesn't seem like its doing that much there. Maybe I just need to fill in my tails a bit more with pencil first.
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,tinysteinyk,3,Sun Mar 29 07:06:49 2015 UTC,I thought the formula was fine but the brush is so terrible. The Loreal version (dupe of Benefit's Gimme Brow) is AMAZING. I no longer have to spend $20 on that little tube. Instead I pay $9 for a tube twice maybe three times as big that does the exact same thing!
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,tinysteinyk,2,Wed Apr 1 03:25:23 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the Loreal one. What's that called? And is the brush similar to the Gimme Brow?
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,LittleHummingbirdy,3,Wed Apr 1 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"It's the Loreal Brow Stylist Plumper. The entire bottle is basically a larger version of the Gimme Brow, including the brush. It's still small enough for perfect control and it doesn't seem to waste as much product as the gimme brow or dry out as fast. I actually prefer it."
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,spandxlightning,2,Wed Apr 1 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"I like this too! I was on the fence about which on to buy (the Brow Stylist Plumper or the Brow Drama) and just took a shot in the dark. I'm pleasantly surprised with the Brow Plumper. I have fairly sparse brows, so I use the ELF eyebrow duo (but only the gel portion)  and then use the Brow Plumper to set and define it slightly. It's awesome."
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,78whispers,3,Fri Apr 3 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"It's not for someone who likes a heavy, sculpted brow, or someone who needs to fill in a lot. I love this product for days when I'm running late and need to do my brows in a hurry, or even at my desk (oops). It's easy, not messy or fussy, and gives me a natural look with minimal effort."
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,MyLittleLabMonkey,2,Sun Mar 29 18:13:02 2015 UTC,I already have kinda thick brows so I figured this would be good. I don't want intense brows just a little definition. Its probably user error but it doesn't seem to be doing much. I'm going to keep playing with it though.
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,speaksincolor,2,Sun Mar 29 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot but I don't need much filling in. I tend to use it alone on light make up days, and over Dipbrow or Gimme Brow if I am going full out. I use it after I am done with my face powder. I feel like it is more for hold and subtle definition than filling in. I hope you find a way to use it!"
drugstoreMUA,30ofh5,protectors,2,Sun Mar 29 15:01:33 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear your thoughts on Gimme Brow! I've been thinking of getting it mainly for the wand - it seems like it would be the perfect size.

drugstoreMUA,30k60g,MeGustaTacos,9,Sat Mar 28 01:58:19 2015 UTC,"I always apply concealer (not color corrector ones) after foundation because then I use less, since foundation should cover up most of the minor issues. I would probably either use the pressed powder or the tone correcting powder, but not both since it could start to look cake-y. I think if you want a matte finish, use the pressed powder since it doesn't appear to have any shimmery ingredients. If you want a luminous/dewy appearance, use the tone correcting powder as a setting powder because it has a lot of mica which will reflect light."
drugstoreMUA,30k60g,simplythere,3,Sat Mar 28 05:08:41 2015 UTC,"I usually do primer first, then any sort of tone correctors and concealers. Once that has set or dried (I use liquid concealers and cream color correctors) then I apply my foundation and finally top it all off with powder (and sometimes a setting spray).  Doing the correcting powder before everything can help all the other stuff 'stick' better, a la the Wayne Goss method :)"
drugstoreMUA,30k60g,Ysenia,2,Sat Mar 28 02:42:21 2015 UTC,Thanks. How well does primer work for you? I was considering getting one but wasn't sure it would make a difference.
drugstoreMUA,30k60g,alysaface,7,Sat Mar 28 02:48:35 2015 UTC,Primer makes all the difference in the staying power and smoothness of applications of any foundations.

drugstoreMUA,30k60g,Ysenia,2,Sat Mar 28 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you use. Right now I'm using a Smashbox sample I got a little while back. As far as drugstore primers go, I'd recommend Rimmel Fix & Pro. It really does make a difference in how long the other products last, just like priming a wall makes a difference before you paint it, lol!"
drugstoreMUA,30k60g,bee_fast,2,Sat Mar 28 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"Try vagisil's (yes,  I'm serious ) anti chafing cream.  Damn near identical to smashbox's primer.  $8 and sometimes goes on sale"
drugstoreMUA,30k60g,Ladyghoul,2,Mon Mar 30 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"When choosing a primer, make sure to get one that matches the ingredients in your foundation. I tried looking on the website but they don't seem to list the ingredients in that foundation. If it has a lot of -cones at the beginning of the list, it's probably silicone based, so you should choose a silicone based primer. If water seems like the main ingredient, choose a water based primer. Sometimes mixing the two will give icky foundation results, but choosing the right primer can really make your foundation last all day and apply more evenly. Hope that helps!"
drugstoreMUA,30k60g,heyitsliz,3,Tue Mar 31 23:54:52 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I'm not quite sure about the tone correcting powder, but for the rest I would do the following: concealer, liquid foundation, pressed powder I would maybe suggest putting the tone correcting powder in between the liquid foundation and pressed powder Hope this helps! Let me know if you figure out something that works for you!"
drugstoreMUA,30kg5u,toomanythoughtss,2,Sat Mar 28 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"I picked this up once cause it was at my local dollar plus store.  Not worth it in my opinion.  They had the highlighter, and the Skin Perfecter for 3$ each so I picked up both.  The highlighter was a huge glitter bomb so I would definitely stay away from that, the Skin Perfecter was okay, kind of strange though and I definitely prefer a traditional primer or setting powder.

drugstoreMUA,30f4mw,speaksincolor,5,Fri Mar 27 13:55:49 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I have that shade. I don't like the cream side - it smears easily and doesn't blend out that smoothly, but the glitter liner side is nice.  It's easy to get a good amount of glitter out and the color is pretty. The cream side is workable as a base for other colors, but it's a pain on its own."
drugstoreMUA,30f4mw,steinbucks,3,Fri Mar 27 18:40:08 2015 UTC,Not yet but I'll swatch it again or put it on my eye for a photo later tonight. It's basically a cream eyeshadow (very pigmented) that can. E used as liner too and a glitter gel that matches. I want to say it was around $8 at CVS
drugstoreMUA,30f4mw,ScoutFinch12,2,Fri Mar 27 21:23:14 2015 UTC,Here are two photos (having trouble making an album via mobile) of the Eye  Art in action. I agree with the other commenter that it's not blendable and transfers to the brow bone easily. It was very pigmented though and the shade is actually pretty nice once it dries.   It goes on like a lip cream with a little doe foot applicator and I actually needed to blot it. You can see some transferred to my brow bone on my right eye. I used the cream shadow and a line of the glittery goop on both eyes. The glitter is great but the shadow isn't the easiest to work with.

Also a Rimmel Kate lipstick in 107. A wine color that's almost raspberry-ish.   Third is a Joe Fresh Longwear Liquid Lipstick in Plum. Available at JC Penny or, if you're Canadian, Superstore. I haven't had much experience with it yet but it's a reddish, almost bricky wine color.   Next is the Rimmel Provocalips in Play With Fire. It's a pretty basic red but it's like, blood red and what's more metal than blood red lips? ... Aside from literal blood on your lips, anyway.   Last is Revlon's Black Cherry. Some people aren't a fan of the formula - personally I've never had a problem but I hear there's a pretty good dupe by Wet n Wild if you're hesitant. A vampy, wine color, super comfortable. The swatch does look a little uneven bit that's mostly due to like... Tendons and stuff in my hand making my swatching canvas fairly bumpy, hahaha.   Edit: damn you, autocorrect."
drugstoreMUA,306mjd,JP731,2,Wed Mar 25 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"If you do get a chance to try out your Joe Fresh lipstick, please consider posting a review. I've been eyeing their Baies Sauvage for a few weeks but I've heard its drying. I'm just not sure if the bloggers in question mean that they're the same amount of drying as other liquid lipsticks (for example, I find Stila's liquid lipstick very drying, and Kat Von D's and NYX's both drying but less so), or like, sandpaper-your-lips-off drying."
drugstoreMUA,306mjd,spandxlightning,2,Wed Mar 25 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"I actually put it on after doing swatches last night, and then wore it all day today. I didn't find it to be drying at all, in fact I thought it was quite comfortable. I did put it on top of a balm though, so that absolutely helps. It doesn't dry quite the same as every other liquid lipstick I've tried, so it does transfer a bit, and doesn't last through a meal. It felt more like a really thick gloss in texture, though I'm sure that was partially due to the lip balm I'd applied beforehand. The pigmentation and application is spectacular though. And it's not pricy at all, so I'd definitely say it's worth picking up."

For dark red, check out Cherry Bomb or Cinnimon Spice (my everyday color). They are sooooo fucking pigmented and stain your lips well so it lasts pretty much all day with a small touch up or two. FYI, Cherry Bomb is much darker than what many swatches on Google images shows, but maybe that's just me"

SO I'm looking for another brand to try lol. But thanks though!

For reference, I have tried CG Lashblast , fusion, Clumpcrusher, Maybelline falsies, telescopic, great lash, collossal etc Even Loreal carbon black waterproof doesn't hold for me!!! :(  The only mascara that holds my curl is: Covergirl Professional Waterproof Mascara. Walmart Link: http://www.walmart.com/ip/COVERGIRL-Professional-Waterproof-Mascara-Very-Black-225-0.3-fl-oz/37301658  ^ I think this pic has old packaging, a more accurate picture is this one:  http://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDwacKBiJXg/maxresdefault.jpg  It holds curls extremely well, but it is waterproof. It doesn't thicken as much as it lengthens though! However, theres no point in thick lashes if they just end up falling and become invisible again!  However, a good solution is to: 1.) Curl lashes like crayzeeey 2.) apply 1 coat of this mascara, let it semi dry 3.) go in with a thickening one (be careful of clumping though!!!)"

The only drugstore mascara I have found that does this is L'oreal telescopic (or however it's spelt) in waterproof. From 6am to 8pm my lashes stay curled. This mascara is mainly just for lengthening so I layer Maybelline Falsies on top. Works pretty well.
drugstoreMUA,306ufn,creambunny,3,Thu Mar 26 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"Sadly telescopic didn't work for me, but I do like the idea of layering the falsies on top of a waterproof one that will work."

Such as: the Colossal, Mega Plush, Pumped Up, and the Falsies.  I honestly rotate between them all and layer them sometimes.    I like big fat fluffy brushes though - the bigger, fatter, and fluffier the better.  I also prefer slightly drier formulas and not waterproof.  But, that's just me :)"

Instead of going into Ulta, visit a couple of beauty supply stores (weave shop/wigs) near you.

Lots of very glittery and shimmery stuff.   I was scoping it out last night and bought a pink eyeliner too. :D"

I will say, I've ordered from them at the weekend, but as it hasn't arrived yet I can't comment on quality- I looked up a lot of reviews first though and everything seems super positive.

I've also been eyeing this cat compact powder for a while.    If she's into cutesy princess-y type stuff, Etude House is definitely the way you want to go. t didn't work too well with my skin, and I remembered not liking the taste on their lip stuff. I tried this chocolate eyeliner which looked great and applied well for a couple of weeks.. but the packaging made it so susceptible to drying out that it's probably better to go for a more traditional pot like Maybelline Eye Studio.

Love them!  I haven't had trouble with it bleeding, but I tend to apply it to the center of the lips first and then define the borders when there is a little less product on the applicator.   When I've tried it with a generic lip balm over it instead of the one that is included in the prouct, I find it will transfer. But it won't with the included balm."
drugstoreMUA,302p8z,Erinescence,5,Tue Mar 24 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"Maybelline 14 HR Super Stay are my HG lipsticks for the same reason (husband and I are very affectionate) and what I ultimately chose for my wedding.   You have to let it set. If you test it within the first half hour, you're going to be disappointed, be patient and let it set. Once it does it's not coming off on anything. Some people have dryness with this (but to be honest, most long-lasting lipsticks have this complaint). I don't have any issues myself, especially if I put on a lip balm prior. After about 6-7 hours my lips do get dry (but that's normal without lipstick on any day, and the color is still awesome) so I may put a balm over the lipstick. It's an easy fix and not really an issue since the payoff is so great."

I'm a makeup newbie for sure but right now I have two Revlon ColorStay lipsticks from the Ultimate Suede line. I don't have enough experience to say for sure whether these are typical for ""long-lasting"" lipsticks but I find they last pretty long without smudging if I apply them right. I got them for about $12 from Shoppers Drug Mart (Canada). So far I find that they smear a lot if I put too much on, but a light layer works pretty well if I let it dry for a while before I touch my lips to anything. A bit of colour comes off on my waterbottle throughout the day, but otherwise it's got pretty good staying power - enough that at the end of the day I still have a bit of a stain even if I didn't reapply at lunch. I haven't tested these with intense makeouts or anything but they don't transfer with just a typical kiss :)"

drugstoreMUA,302p8z,wittyusernametaken,3,Tue Mar 24 01:08:53 2015 UTC,"Oooh stains are my favorite types of lip products. Revlon Balm Stains, Revlon Just Bitten Stains, NYC Lip Stains (the marker ones I haven't tried the new doe foot ones), Jordana Balm Stains have amazing opacity (and are like $3!) but they transfer a tiny bit if they are freshly applied, Loreal Infalliable are amazing liquid lipsticks that totally set but I personally don't like the feel of them. I prefer the texture of balm stains or the marker style stains that I can put a lip balm over them. Exfoliate your lips well when using these products as the stains really exaggerate imperfections and dry lips."

drugstoreMUA,302p8z,allrattedup,3,Tue Mar 24 04:35:57 2015 UTC,"I bought a couple and maybe it was the batch I got but they were the biggest waste of money for me. They applied so patchy, they dry out so quickly without use, one of the red colors I got only stained yellow, they were so ridiculously drying and ruined my lips and the balm was a joke with absolutely no hydration. (I wrote them and they gave me free replacements which were also only staining yellow, indicating either that they were from the same batch or they're hit or miss) the balm stain jumbo crayon things on the other hand I liked so much, I can't wait to bust out the bright color for spring!"
drugstoreMUA,302p8z,bo_ob,2,Tue Mar 24 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"Really?! I have 7 of them and the only one that dried out on me was the red (gothic) but I used it like 3 times a week for like a year and as long as I exfoliated well I had little patchiness. The balm isn't great, that's for sure. I use a separate one and have never had a problem.   I do generally prefer the balm stains though. I agree with you on that."
drugstoreMUA,302p8z,allrattedup,2,Tue Mar 24 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I had shitty luck because the first couple applications were alright but after that they were just completely useless for me. Gothic is the one that came out yellow for me I think.   It sucks because I wanted to like them sooo much, I actually really liked them at first but the novelty wore off after the first use. At least some other people have had good experiences with them though"

You can turn any lipstick into a kiss-proof, long-lasting lipstick with a British product called Lipcote which you can find on Amazon.  It's a little expensive for the typical drugstore products, but it is soooooo worth it.  You can't turn ANY LIPSTICK into long-lasting lipstick.  You have to follow the directions exactly, but I swear by it."

I've had great success with it. Very nourishing, lasts for quite a while (I've had mine for nearly 3 months and I've still got over 1/2 left - I wear lipstick almost everyday) and it doesn't have a strange smell or taste. Goes on clear and matte, and creates a lovely semi-tacky feeling to really grab the lipstick and make it last. It also makes the colour glide on without a bunch of streaking.

drugstoreMUA,2zyqxm,eisenkatze,2,Mon Mar 23 10:41:26 2015 UTC,"I had that issue with Touch of Spice, too.  The way I fixed it was to exfoliate my lips with a brown sugar/olive oil mix right out of the shower before I do any makeup.  I rinse it off gently and then apply either vaseline or a thick layer of chapstick (original is great for this; there's less slip on the lips).  Then I do my whole makeup routine, blot the vaseline/chapstick a bit, and then I apply the Touch of Spice in very thin layers and gently blot between.  Usually I do two layers.  Side note, I LOVE my EOS, but I never use them under lipstick.  I don't find them moisturizing at all unless they're alone/used as just balm.  Chapstick is my HG.  edit: spelling"

drugstoreMUA,2zug13,Womenwhokill,4,Wed Mar 25 04:28:23 2015 UTC,"Echoing the L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation suggestion. The N1-2 shade might work for you.  As far as primers go, I've seen the L'Oreal Magic Lumi Light Infusing Primer recommended for folks with dry skin. It's supposed to be a dewy, hydrating primer. I picked some up but haven't had a chance to test it yet. I think ELF just came out with a hydrating primer too, but I haven't heard much about it."

drugstoreMUA,2zug13,CaptainCorpsie,3,Sat Mar 21 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"I have very dry skin that's often dull or patchy. It was only until recently that I found the right foundation and primer combination.  The original Maybelline FITme would be your best bet. I have found it more hydrating than my L'Oreal. While my True Match foundation is okay, I'm just itching to finish the bottle so I can run out and buy another FITme!  EDIT: As for primer, I usually use Monistat's Anti-chafing gel. If you want to increase the longevity of your makeup, maybe changing how you apply the foundation will help. I've tried the Goss method and ohmygod that shit stays on.  After letting my moisturizer absorb into the skin, I'll add primer and let that set on my skin for about a minute. Before foundation, I lightly apply a loose powder and let that set for minute or two before applying my foundation. I've found that a) I use less product and b) it applies so much more smoothly.  This is what works for me! Let me know if you try it and works for you. :)"
drugstoreMUA,2zug13,starpocalypse,7,Sun Mar 22 20:54:43 2015 UTC,The Revlon Colorstay foundation is amaaaaazing. I use the oily formula but I've heard great things about the dry skin formula.  On top I'd highly recommend NYX Dewy Long Lasting Setting Spray. I know you said foundation or primer but I swear that stuff helps increase the staying power and genuinely gives off a dewy finish.

drugstoreMUA,2zpr0u,ospiteohell,8,Fri Mar 20 16:39:03 2015 UTC,"Overall Review: I like the e.l.f. Studio line of brushes. I think they are generally good products for the price, and I think that most of these new offerings are even higher quality than the rest of the line (as they should be, since they cost double what most of the other brushes in the line do). I've washed them and didn't notice any shedding or dye bleeding into the water. They all feel sturdy, and the ferrules felt secure. I think these are good products for those on a budget, and I still use some e.l.f. Studio brushes every day even though I own more expensive brushes.  Ultimate Blending Brush: Very soft, densely packed bristles. When I use a brush for my foundation, I've usually preferred a flat-top brush like the e.l.f. Powder Brush (pictured) or the EcoTools Custom Coverage Buffing Brush. I don't own the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush, though it looks very similar to the e.l.f. Ultimate Blending Brush. This brush did a fine job blending out my foundation, and the curved edges made it feel softer than the flat-top Powder Brush. I didn't see any streaks or uneven coverage. It was also small enough that I could use it to blend out my under-eye concealer without needing an additional brush, which was nice. I recommend it if you're looking for an effective, inexpensive foundation buffing brush.  Contouring Brush: I was a little intimidated by this; at first I was afraid it was going to leave a really harsh, obvious line. Again, the bristles are very soft but still densely packed. Since they're so short, they make the brush pretty firm, which I found actually aided in blending. It picked up the product easily and blended easily. This is one of two standouts from my order. If you're looking for a drugstore Ita-style contouring brush, I definitely recommend this one over the SOHO Disney Ariel contouring brush, which is apparently for ants.  Eyebrow Duo Brush: This is the other standout from my order. I really like the e.l.f. Small Angled Brush for any kind of brow product, and the angled brush end of this is identical to that. It's good for precision work. The spoolie end, as you can see, is quite a bit smaller than the spoolie on the e.l.f. Essential Eyelash & Brow Wand--I'd say close to half the size. It's very, VERY sturdy, though. The whole brush feels very high quality and solid. This brush is fantastic, definitely my favorite out of all of the ones I bought.  Blending Brush: This isn't as new as the other brushes, but it's been sold out every time I've tried to order it, so I jumped at the chance to get my hands on it when it was in stock at the same time as the other three brushes. As I mentioned in the Imgur album, I was really hoping it would be a ""dupe"" for the RT Base Shadow Brush, which I use every day. The e.l.f. brush is just a tiny bit bigger than the RT one--bristles are longer and the brush head is a little wider. Aside from that, it looks the same. Unfortunately, the bristles are a little too floppy to be very effective at packing on shadow, and it doesn't pick up product very well. I am disappointed in this purchase. Out of all the brushes I purchased, this is the only one that I can't really recommend."

I was concerned about the contour brush after I saw how tiny the SOHO brush was, so I wanted to show it with the other brushes for scale. It's a really good size for my face: not so wide that it's hard to control, but not so small that it's impossible to blend."

drugstoreMUA,2zh4gy,Womenwhokill,3,Thu Mar 19 04:48:55 2015 UTC,I actually wouldn't recommend it because it is too long lasting. Such a bitch to remove.

As in, I'm still wearing eyeliner the next day after a shower and washing my face. I haven't tried their liquid liner yet, but I'm going to. The pencil tugs a little bit, but much less than other drugstore pencils I've tried. I'd highly recommend them."
drugstoreMUA,2zh4gy,anathea,5,Wed Mar 18 17:07:48 2015 UTC,I like their liquid liner!  I don't tightline but the staying power is comparable to mid range brands.

Probably my favorite drugstore lip color ever. Jordana - Terra Crave - a terra cotta MLBB-y color. Unfortunately, after a few hours it turns into a weird raspberry-ish color (Revlon Honey did the same thing on me), though this might not happen to you. Revlon - Peach Me - a light-medium peach Revlon - Teak Rose - hard to describe, kind of reddish-brownish but not a brick red Revlon - Wine with Everything (creme) - brick red Revlon - Coralberry - a pinky coral Revlon balm stain - Rendezvous - a more orange-y coral   Favorite drugstore blushes:   Milani Luminoso - light shimmery peach Milani Rose d'Oro - deep shimmery golden peach Wet n Wild Pearlescent Pink - shimmery peachy pink"

So far my favorite things that I've bought that are drugstore items are Revlon Matte Balm in Sultry, Wet n Wild Comfort Zone palette and NYX Tea Rose lipstick. Higher end items I've bought and love are Lipstick Queen in Saint Pinky Nude, Nars Heat Wave lipstick, Nars Exhibit A blush, MAC Twig and Kinda Sexy lipsticks,  Naked 1 Palette, and Bobbi Brown peach corrector.  Things I've bought that didn't really work for me are MAC Pure Zen (too light for me, I'm definitely a tan olive as opposed to a light olive) and Revlon balm stain in Rendezvous (too orange).  Edited for typo"
drugstoreMUA,2zcxac,eisenkatze,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:42:33 2015 UTC,I'll have to try some of those :) I have Revlon Sultry and Naked1 and agree they are good :)   Mac Pure Zen is pretty but oh so pale.  I've pretty much reconciled with myself I'll never get away with pale lips.  It looks awful and my lips already have a little color so unless they're saturated they don't even show good.  Oh well. Tis the life ;)
drugstoreMUA,2zcxac,ashleemalfoy,2,Thu Mar 19 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"How did you find out that you have olive skin? I'm fair and not sure if my undertones are yellow, green or just plain neutral, so I'm interested in how other people figure this out. I'm trying to look at guides and failing, and looking at pictures of myself with other people as per the Musicalhouses blog post isn't helpful either because we all either have varying tans or the skintone shows up basically the same. I follow the ""warm skin"" rules but a lot of the olive recommendations really suit me as well, so I don't know what the hell is going on! How ;_;"
drugstoreMUA,2zcxac,asadhouse,8,Tue Mar 17 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm not 100% sure I have Olive skin.  So my understanding is olive skin has both warm and cool tones and the blending on the surface is ""green"".  I don't quite get it and that post you're referring to I swear I could never tell In her pictures!! I took note of what colors of makeup and clothes looked good on me and noticed they didn't fit in either warm or cool... Which could be neutral.  Same with silver vs gold jewelry.    I read Olive skin has under eye circles a lot and they are the bane of my existence.  Some photos I swear I look warm toned in some pics and cool in others.  I never see the green tinge, but, I never saw it in that blog post photos!  I knew that pale or frosty lips look awful on me which is said of Olive skin. I prefer darker berries or my new favorite is the Burts Bees Redwood Forest.  I get compliments on that I have seen on reddit that is great for Olive skin.  I did recently take a photo though where I swear my chest looked ""green"".  They also say you can be more golden when you tan and but pretty pinkish when pale.  I honestly am not 100% sure, but, I have a feeling I am Olive skin.  I figure trial and error with products and I'll figure it out :)   Hope this helps!   Ps the link on MUA someone mentioned has some decent information too :)"
drugstoreMUA,2zcxac,sierralfa,3,Tue Mar 17 23:08:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was very helpful! I'm like more than half convinced that I'm olive, but I don't know if I'm qualified to advise other olives on this. I'm super yellow but ""warm"" doesn't seem quite right, so it was good to see comments about yellow being an olive trait! As for makeup, I look bad in pretty much anything light, especially brightly colored, but bright red lipstick looks amazing. My brightest is a limited edition Catrice lip cream which I think is equivalent to Essence's matt effect lip gloss in ""silky red"". Lip creams often have the pigmentation and saturation that I need. That lip gloss in ""soft nude"" is also a lovely nude that doesn't make me look like a corpse. Deep browns are good, but I'm still struggling to figure out eyeshadows beside bronze."

drugstoreMUA,2zbrnv,Ysenia,6,Tue Mar 17 13:10:04 2015 UTC,"The Glamoflage foundation is a lot lighter coverage compared to the concealer. I would qualify it as a medium coverage but you can build it up. That being said, I love the Glamoflage concealer!"

drugstoreMUA,2zbrnv,Miss_Anthropie,3,Sat Mar 21 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely a fan of it. Doesn't oxidize orange, and the lighter tones have a lovely bit of a yellow cast rather than pink. Opaque as a mother and a little goes a long way. The tube lasts forever as a result. I've had mine for about a year and I've yet to see very much of a dent in it! I ended up decanting some into a small sample jar and even that's going slowly."
drugstoreMUA,2zbrnv,secretlyMIA,3,Sat Mar 21 00:24:52 2015 UTC,It's the most pigmented concealer that I've found at the drugstore for covering blemishes. I find it does need a minute to dry and be set with powder. It's a thicker consistency though so I can't personally use it under my eyes.

Let it be known that it does not have full on coverage like Mac studiofix powder, but for $2.99 it may be HG for a lot of us who like a natural medium coverage or like to use powder to set their foundations. I feel like this powder looks better the more I buff it in, given i exfoliate well beforehand (as with any time Im wearing makeup). For the price, more people need to try it! It looks beautiful when I set it with a spray to take away the powdery look."

Sorry, can't help you there, but I will say that at $2.99, you wouldn't be losing much if you went ahead and bought a Coverall just by taking a gander through the packaging.

I'm so excited to give this powder a try :) also, some cc, i think you could benefit from darkening the beginning of your eyebrows (closest to the bridge of your nose) a bit more and then brushing the whole brow upwards in with a spoolie. It makes a huge difference :)"
drugstoreMUA,2z7a57,fuzzy_theropod,2,Mon Mar 16 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed my brow(heads? like, as opposed to the tail of the brow?) looked a little nonexistent when viewed at an angle. Thanks for the CC! When I do fill in the beginnings of my brows more, it always seems so...harsh to me. Maybe I'm just not used to my brows looking that way?  Re spoolying: I have a hard time keeping my brow hairs shaped the way I want. They're very coarse and straight; the wax from my NYX kit is not doing it right now :| any suggestions?"
drugstoreMUA,2z7a57,whalebabeh,2,Tue Mar 17 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"Always brush the brow hairs up before beginning! And filling in the head can look harsh at first but the trick is to apply very little product on the head and drag your spoolie from the head to the middle of each eyebrow pretty much like you're trying to erase the head of the brow you just created. All it does is soften the look of it and make it look more natural. Sometimes if it STILL looks too harsh i even apply a bit of concealer  between my eyebrows right beside each brow head and then respoolie the shit out of it again. :) i use a brow pencil, though, i prefer it to a wax or gel product and to set my brows i use mousse (which stays longer than wax) and just brush the mousse upwards. Usually they stay when i go through this whole process and my thick and coarse latina brows are pretty defiant as well. :) also, youre welcome and good luck! Let me know how it works for you!

Girl Concealer, Cover Girl Foundation, & a Bronzer, but use whatever does the trick for you.  -I then used a flat brush to paint on the heart using MAC Retro Matte Riri Boy (and boy is this matte).  -I then outlined outer part of the heart with my Kiss High Precision Liquid Liner, of course, in ink black.  -Next, I used my smudge eye brush to apply the black shadow inbetween my lips and along the dark corners which I previously outlined. I used MAC The Monster's Bride Palette in Carbon (but any black eyeshadow will do). I then used my blending eye brush to blend it in so it does not have a harsh line.  -The highlight, you MUST use a liquid or gel liner to apply this final touch. Tried to use a pencil and it tried to turn my heart pink (argh)! I have no idea of the name of the product I used (it has zero labels), but I used a very skinny, and small, paint brush to apply the highlight.  *And to give credit, I got this idea from @depechegurl on Instagram.

Initially, I was in love with them and wore one of them almost every day. They smell wonderful (like cake batter) and go on very smoothly. My biggest complaint is that they rub off very easily and make my lips SUPER dry. The color, however, is fantastic."

I don't think they're really drying just make sure you exfoliate and use ChapStick before if your lips are chapped beforehand. They last about 3 hours on me I think before it starts fading in the middle of my lips. I know Kathleen lights has a review and swatch video,  if you want a link just say so."

I'm an Nc45 and both are super flattering on me. I really love the colors and the way they feel light and not drying no on the lips.

She said some of the lighter shades took a slight cast from her lip color but nothing super detrimental. In general liquid lipsticks will probably be a good bet though, they're usually very pigmented or almost totally opaque.  I personally only have experience with the Wet n' Wild Megalast lipsticks and those are pretty amazing, if a little drying. I have a Purty Persimmon and Mauve Outta Here and they're really pigmented."

They are the first nudes that have worked for me with my light skin and contrasting features. The first one is VERY nude but somehow avoids the concealer lips look. Applied on bare lips it's a bit pinkish, on lipliner it's more brown. I never thought such a color could look good on me. The lipgloss in ""soft nude"" is slightly darker and coral-ish. They both have a semi-matte finish and cover well without gathering in creases, and have decent staying power on me."

drugstoreMUA,2yxbo6,ospiteohell,13,Fri Mar 13 16:43:01 2015 UTC,Your swatches really show the differences incredibly well. I love how it seems to be a sparkle 'booster' for already-sparkly shadows or an easy way to make your favorite mattes sparkle. All the sparkles!
drugstoreMUA,2yxbo6,mistikate,14,Fri Mar 13 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"Review:  I've been a fan of the original Wet n Wild Fergie eye primer for quite a while now. It's the most effective eye primer I've used. I vastly prefer it to Urban Decay Primer Potion, which never worked particularly well for me. It keeps my makeup in place regardless of how humid it is, whether I'll be active or just sitting at my desk, whether the air conditioning poltergeist is feeling magnanimous, etc. This primer can sometimes make shadows difficult to blend; my work around is to apply it before I do my brows so it has plenty of time to set.  Given how much I like the original, I decided to try the shimmer version. Upon application, the shimmer primer feels identical to the original (if you hate the feeling of the original, I regret to say you probably won't like this one either), though it seems like the shimmer primer might be a little thicker--I have to squeeze the tube harder to dispense the product. The product itself is a neutral, slightly pink shimmer--if you're interested in something similar to UDPP in Sin (though not an exact dupe), this might be a good option, especially since it costs less than $5.  In the swatches, you can see that the original primer makes colors look more intense than on bare skin, but the shimmer primer seems to make them look darker, too. It gives the matte color Sandstone a pearlescent sheen, and it intensifies the shimmer in Bubbly while also giving it a subtle pinkish tone. It's a beautiful effect if that's what you're going for, but if you want a totally matte finish, you'll be happier with the original.  As far as lasting power goes, I've worn the shimmer primer a few times now, and I've found it to be just as effective as the original. I apply my makeup at 7:30 every morning, and both primer formulations keep it locked in place until I wash my face at 9:00 PM. I haven't tried using the primer on its own for a quick, subtle work look yet, so I don't know how well it lasts without a powder shadow on top. If you've used it alone as a cream shadow, please feel free to let me know how it worked out for you.  Final verdict: as a primer, the shimmer does a great job intensifying eyeshadows and helping them last all day. If you're looking for something to really enhance your shimmery shadows, this might be a great budget-friendly option. If you're a matte lover, though, be aware that this will change the finish of your shadows in ways that you might dislike.  Product list:   Wet n Wild Fergie Take on the Day Eyeshadow Primer (For My Primas) Wet n Wild Fergie Take on the Day Shimmer Eyeshadow Cream Primer (A Little Party...)

drugstoreMUA,2yx9ur,havenflavem,9,Fri Mar 13 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"(Not drugstore but) I bought a Too Faced anti-feathering liner, and first tried lining inside my lips like you would with a colored one... my lipstick showed up darker on top and I had an ugly ring around the mouth effect. So yes definitely pay attention to directions like I didn't do, and line outside your lipline. Also, one clear lip pencil theoretically saves you money since it works with all the shades :)"
drugstoreMUA,2yx9ur,jerk--alert,4,Fri Mar 13 20:14:27 2015 UTC,I've tried the Rimmel one and noticed zero difference
drugstoreMUA,2yx9ur,BasorexicPoltergeist,2,Fri Mar 13 16:43:16 2015 UTC,I have the Rimmel one and don't like it either. It does stop feathering for me AT FIRST. It doesn't last long and drys out my lips. I wouldn't recommend it.

drugstoreMUA,2yx9ur,cat_with_giant_boobs,3,Fri Mar 13 17:19:44 2015 UTC,"I used it last night (I actually just bought it last night) with a liquid lipstick and I remember looking at my lips and admiring how well and evenly I put it on (because normally it looks like I put lipstick on left-handed and blindfolded) and then I was like duh, it was the lipliner. So who knows. Maybe they reformulated it?"
drugstoreMUA,2yx9ur,MissRepresentation,2,Fri Mar 13 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"I actually read that clear lipliners are supposed to be used on the outside of the lips! I didn't know that until recently so I am literally trying it out tonight. I'm wearing Milani's clear lip liner and Revlon HD Ultra lipgloss in Tourmaline. I generally expect feathering from these glosses because they are SOOO pigmented and thick.   I will hopefully remember to give an update tomorrow on how the lipliner holds up.   EDIT: So, I ate wings last night while wearing the lipliner. Most of the lipgloss came off, but there wasn't really any feathering, so I'm impressed with that. HOWEVER, I do want to test half my lips with the lipliner and half without to see if it truly does work and prevent feathering. But I think that will be another challenge for another day, since tonight I'll be wearing a Wet n Wild Megalast lipstick which just doesn't feather haha."

People rarely talk about them from what I've seen, but Loreal's nail polishes in the square/rectangular bottles are so good. The brushes are cut in a rounded shape so getting a clean line is super easy. The formula is killer on all the shades I own and are all nearly opaque in one coat but are perfect in 2. Self-leveling too and I get a long wear time from them with my top and base coat.  I also like Revlon's polishes in the ""cone"" shaped bottles, but the brushes aren't the best (very thin and don't fan out well). But they're pretty pigmented, you get a generous amount and there 's a good selection of colors. Their quick dry topcoat is pretty solid too but nothing amazing, I used it before I found my HG quick-dry. Sally Hansen polishes are usually good bets too, but I'm not fond of most of their colors so I don't have a ton of experience with them. I know the Intsa-Dri's are great for stamping though. NYC's polishes are solid too, though a good deal of mine tend to be quite sheer and don't build all that well."

I will say that the Sally Hansen has better/smoother application on the light colors like yellows and light blues, Revlon can be a little tricky to apply without getting bare spots on those lighter colors.  Sinful is pretty decent, but I've found that some of their colors chip faster than others.   Rimmel is pretty good too, and this week all Rimmel cosmetics are 1/2 off at Walgreens which means their polishes are less than a dollar in my area!"

Hair dryer gave lipstick swagger, but it still has the security sticker.  Acetone helped with the sticky, but it removed the gold paint of the tube, leaving a dull grey corpse colored tube with metal security fibers on it. I also enthusiastically tried to remove the fibers with tweezers and gouged the tube so I really screwed up the texture.  So, friends, learn from my fail. Buy lipsticks from the cvs in the nicer neighborhood that doesn't have security stickers on everything. I go there often enough I'm going to talk to the manager, not that I want a refund but let him know that he's making the stuff hard to used if he tags the stuff directly."

That said, some bigger places may have testers.  I remember walking into my local Walgreens for the first time and being shocked to see that they had testers for the full range of L'Oreal True Match foundations.

drugstoreMUA,2yebx4,crazymakeuplady,3,Mon Mar 9 01:55:27 2015 UTC,"Hourglass ALP in ""Dim Light"": Described as a ""neutral soft beige that provides a perfect balance of warm and cool tones to blur imperfections"", which I think stands pretty true to the powder's overall performance.  The closest ""dupe""  (although I would consider it less of a dupe and more of an adequate alternative) to this powder I have found would have to be Makeup Revolution's Radiant Light Powder in ""Breath"".  As you can see from the images, they differ in colour just slightly, ”Breath” is about half of a shade lighter than ”Dim” and slightly more warm-toned.  With a light hand, both make lovely setting powders that I truly believe blur imperfections and give you that “lit from within” glow without looking shiny.    Hourglass ALP in “Diffused Light”: This powder is described as “a soft, warm, pale yellow that reduces redness, eliminates shine, and gives skin clarity”.  While, I do not find ”Diffused” to be nearly as perfecting as ”Dim” it is a nice powder for daily use and does moderately deliver on all of its claims.  I have heard that Wet n’ Wild’s “Reserve Your Cabana” Bronzing Powder is a good dupe for ”Diffused Light”, and since I just happened to have it lying around I decided to put it to the test.  Overall, I am not overly impressed with “Reserve Your Cabana” (I think this might be an unpopular opinion, but oh well).  I enjoy the smell, the pan is huge, and it is dirt cheap, but with that I find it to be pretty chalky, hard to build up, and a strange color.  While, ”Diffused Light” is described as being a “pale yellow”, as you can see from the images, “Reserve Your Cabana” is several shades darker but also yellow.  It might just be because I am fair skinned, but I find the combination of the Reserve Your Cabana's colour and texture to look very muddy on the face whether it is used as a highlight or an all over setting powder.    Hourglass ALP in “Incandescent Light”: Incandescent light is exclusive to the ALP palette and makes a lovely, subtle highlighting powder.  When I was first doing research about the ALP palette, everyone seemed to be raving about this gem, and I understand why.  Unlike all of my other highlighting powders, this one gives an unbelievably natural glow to the skin, and is incredibly easy to use.    When I first received Makeup Revolution's Radiant Light Powder in *""Exhale” I was blown away by how it was almost the exact colour of ”Incandescent Light”.  After a week of wearing ”Exhale” I have to say that it is very similar, but just a tad bit more pigmented than ”Incandescent Light” making it a little harder to apply perfectly, but with a light hand I have to say it is definitely worth saving ~$45 on the ALP Palette.    OVERALL, I think that Makeup Revolution’s powders can work as an excellent alternative to Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder’s, at a much lower price.  That said, there are a few inconsistencies between the powders that should be considered when determining which would be the right one for you specifically."

I own 5 of them (I am a shameful person, I know) and I find each of them lovely, and truly unique in my collection.  ""Dolce Pink"" and ""Luminoso"" are cult classics and it is easy to understand why.  ""Dolce Pink"" is a true pink with gold shimmer that is reminiscent of highend blushes on the cheeks as it really gives you a lovely glow.  ""Lumnioso"" is a light peach that it flattering on almost anyone, and very easy to use.  Other favourites of mine are ""Red Vino"", a deep red with gold shimmer, and ""Fantastico Mauve"", which is a mauvey shade also with gold shimmer.  I also have ""Coralina"", which I do not love as much as the other 4 but looks really nice on fair brunettes, or girls with freckles IMO.    I also recently got 9 of the new HD blushes by NYX in an EBAY auction.  I am really impressed with them so far and I am in love shade called ""Soft Spoken"", which kind of reminds me of a muted version of Milani's ""Luminoso""."

Definitely not something I'd recommend, but then I see a lot of people who adore it. It might work better for people who use sponges instead of brushes.

To me Reserve Your Cabana has a shimmer to it, the Ambient Lighting Powders were more brightening.  Since you're oily, I would stay away from using Reserve Your Cabana as a finishing powder, it might exacerbate any oil."
drugstoreMUA,2y7lyj,theangeler,3,Sat Mar 7 04:25:50 2015 UTC,I use it as an all over finishing powder because I am too light to use it as a highlighter. I use it over a powder because I am so oily.

After foundation, setting powder, blush, bronzer etc.  I personally use Hourglass/Guerlain a lot, but I recommended RYC in a thread the other day as a finishing powder that I personally find works for me.  Its much more shimmery than its higher end counter-parts, so it definitely needs a light hand. RYC doesn't work as a highlight for me at all.  Also, oily girls (like myself) can definitely use this, and other finishing powders. Its all about the placement and products you use. I have a very matte base, and I only highlight the top of my cheekbones, and the inner corner of my eyes. Then a light dusting of finishing powder takes me to a satin finish."

I believe they are around the same price as well. I think I saw nyx bb cream for 12 dollars at ultra today. I work at Walgreens and the Garnier products go on buy one get one half off all the time so I'd snag a bottle or two then.

It was really nice at first and so so soft I thought I was converted. Well its been 2 months and it's dry and clumping all the time now. I think what makes the formula soft is what's causing it to dry so fast.

Full bloom will give you more volume (in my experience) but I'll need to use my lash comb (which I use with both of them anyways). I think full bloom is drier, but clump crusher gets starts drying out eventually.  I've noticed that full bloom tends to smudge under my eyes, but that may be because I don't have the waterproof one. Full bloom is easier and I don't have to work with it as much as I do with clump crusher. I've noticed that it is a softer mascara, and not as crunchy, which I really like."

The orange one is honestly the best for long eyelashes that need volume. I found FB to be too dry and gave me really natural looking lashes (which is fine, but I want VOLUME). CC tends to weigh my lashes down, and I kind of hate the plastic wand. Lately my eyes have been irritated by the Orange kind so I've switched to the purple CG Professional mascara on my top lashes and I'm using CC on the bottom lashes because the brush is nice and small and it doesn't transfer very much.

We do have L'Oreal, Maybelline, Rimmel and such here, but I can't find pictures of one that seems to do the same thing, and they're still too expensive to buy blindly. Essence is a big player in the mascara game but their ""no clump"" mascaras are just completely no. I wish they brought back the one single Essence thing that worked... maybe I should wait for a free gift again, for some reason all the best mascaras I've ever gotten were free :D"

drugstoreMUA,2y1psl,glaceauglaceau,3,Thu Mar 5 23:20:02 2015 UTC,I second the wet n wild shadows and will throw in a vote for the L'Oreal Infallible shadows - they are amazing.
drugstoreMUA,2xz7wa,WiggleWerra,12,Thu Mar 5 02:25:15 2015 UTC,"The Covergirl 3 in 1 has a thinner consistency and a medium coverage. The Fit Me has a  thicker consistency and a medium to full coverage. I like the finish of the Fit Me better because it doesn't accentuate dry patches and leaves a smooth, demi matte finish. However, Covergirl 3 in 1 lasts much longer without getting shiny. It really just depends on what you're looking for. Long lasting- covergirl. Smooth finish, full coverage- Fit Me"
drugstoreMUA,2xz7wa,nutmegs226,2,Thu Mar 5 02:56:12 2015 UTC,"this was really helpful, thank you! I ended up getting the 3 in 1, but the fit me sounds good so I can't wait to try that in the future."
drugstoreMUA,2xz7wa,music_at_work,3,Thu Mar 5 04:13:53 2015 UTC,Fit Me Matte & Poreless is a tricky foundation to work with. It gets cakey really easily and I found that it definitely takes a lot trial and error to get it to work. I found that in the end it works best when I mix it with some moisturizer.
drugstoreMUA,2xz7wa,Cameo-Illustrated,2,Thu Mar 5 14:09:49 2015 UTC,"I like to mix mine with primer. This way, I don't lose coverage and it's more pliable without caking."
drugstoreMUA,2xz7wa,Cameo-Illustrated,3,Thu Mar 5 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have only tried the Fit Me! And I wouldn't really recommend it. It accentuates a lot of lines and dryness that you wouldn't otherwise notice. I do hear a lot of good things about the L'oreal Pro Matte. I haven't tried it but it might work out for you. I don't think I have heard anything bad about it yet."
drugstoreMUA,2xz7wa,initial-friend,2,Thu Mar 5 14:55:27 2015 UTC,I didn't care for the Fit Me and I took it back. But I have really dry skin and it really showed the dry skin flakes. It also wasn't very hydrating and I don't think it lasted that long. It also looked kinda cakey imo.   I've actually been very impressed with the 3-in-1. It's become my go to drugstore foundation and I'm really impressed with how long it lasts on my face. I do wish it gave slightly better coverage though because I have some redness and acne scars it doesn't cover as well. But it is buildable without looking cakey.
drugstoreMUA,2xz7wa,SoftMetalFoxes,2,Thu Mar 5 17:07:32 2015 UTC,"I see you got the CG - I liked it too when I still used DS foundation. I don't recommend putting powder all over it, as it can cake, but I have skin on the dry side, so YMMV! Otherwise it's a nice formula and I wish it matched my skin a little better."

Plus they wear on the eye for a long time.  If you get a neutral color like ""Bad to the Bronze, you could just weep it onto your lids as a fast eyeshadow look.  Also if you look to the sidebar you will find the Drugstore Master list."

I used to only buy high end stuff for my face, but I've found this works just as well and is superrr cheap.  I would also suggest, if you're on a budget, that you check out ulta. They always have coupons on retailmenot, and carry most of the drugstore brands."
drugstoreMUA,2xx3tg,touche_parfait,3,Wed Mar 4 21:59:31 2015 UTC,"So I'm at work on my phone at the moment (I know, I know), so I'll have a hard time with specifics and formatting, but some things I've really liked:  -I've had great experiences with pretty much any CoverGirl mascara. The most recent one I tried was the double-ended pink one (is that the Fusion?).   -Also with CoverGirl, the 3-in-1 foundation is great!  -I'm currently using a Revlon foundation. I think it's the Airbrushed one? It gets the job done.   -the Revlon balm stains are amazing. Especially the shade Honey. I would highly recommend it!  -if you're more of a tinted balm person (like I am most of the time) I'd suggest Maybelline's Baby Lips or Nivea's tinted balms.   -as for blushes, I've tried both Maybelline's Fit Me line and some of No. 7's blushes, and loved both.   -I haven't had much luck with any drugstore primer, but by far the best was Baby Skin from Maybelline.   -For eye primers, I'd try Nyx's HD primer.   -For setting powder, I really like Elf's translucent HD powder.   -Maybelline's Fit Me concealers are hands down the best I've ever tried. I also like their under-eye correctors.  -Eyeliners: L'Oreal has good eyeliners. NYC and Rimmel do as well.   -Last but definitely not least in my heart, eyeshadows. I love eyeshadows. Nyx has great eyeshadows. Sonia Kashuk has amazing shadows, but are a bit pricey for the drugstore. I'd also check our L'Oreal and Maybelline.   I feel like I'm forgetting something. I'll edit if I remember what it was.   Edit: already. Oy. You said brushes. Elf has some great brushes for a reasonable price. Make sure you go with the black handled ones, though."
drugstoreMUA,2xx3tg,riseandrise,2,Wed Mar 4 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, that purple liner you have would probably do great things for your eyes as well! Purple helps bring out blue (not sure why but hey) so it might be worth experimenting with it to get that ""pop"" you're looking for :) I have gray eyes and I always use purple liner when I want them to look more blue."
drugstoreMUA,2xy5dw,LaFeltinelli,3,Wed Mar 4 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"I have both and I personally like Clump Crusher more. Lash Sensational's formula is really wet and the brush shape apparently doesn't work for me (too curved?). Every time I use LS I get mascara all over my undereyes and eyelids... not saying it flakes or runs during the day, it's just very messy to apply for me. However, LS has a really nice, dark black color... not a dull grayish-black like some mascaras.   Clump Crusher is my tried and true favorite mascara. I like the drier formula, brush shape and overall effect. Lash Sensational is a good mascara too (dark color, adds volume, doesn't flake) but I always make a mess when I apply it."
drugstoreMUA,2xy5dw,bigrob31,4,Thu Mar 5 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"I hated the Clump Crusher. Lash Sensational is one of my top mascaras.  BG info on me and my lashes: They're thin, asian lashes that lack in volume. My lashes are pretty long so in a mascara, I look for something that defines and volumizes.  Thoughts on Clump Crusher: first off, I hated the smell. In fact, I also hate the smell of CG's Bombshell mascara so it might just be the fragrances the brand uses. The formula is rather thick, closer to wet than it is dry. This mascara performed poorly on my lashes. It did not add any volume or length. And it is not very buildable. A single light coat looked fine for very natural days. The more I built it up, the ""clumpier"" it got. My lashes would still look separated.... But they were more sparse in appearance because the mascara would just brush through so that 2 of 3 lashes would stick to look like one each. My lashes never looked messy though, just sad and pathetic.  Thoughts on Lash Sensational: no scent. The formula starts off very wet and thin. It is easy to brush on smoothly, as it glides onto your lashes. The longer bristles really add the product while the shorter bristles are brilliant at separating. This mascara doesn't do too much for length but it gives the illusion of volume. It defines and separates each lash so well that it does in fact, give a fan effect. It builds well also! This mascara isn't great for drama though. I really think this mascara is perfect for giving you your natural lashes at their best. It's what Clump Crusher should have been with a little bit of L'oreal Butterfly's flair.  Keep in mind that certain lashes will react differently to different mascaras. My lashes hated Clump Crusher and they have also hated Benefit's They're Real! So if you think your lashes are similar to mine, then I recommend Lash Sensational. But I have seen Clump Crusher do wonders for lashes that are entirely different from mine.  Hope this helped."
drugstoreMUA,2xy5dw,Cameo-Illustrated,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"My vote is for Clump Crusher. Lash Sensational was very clumpy on me and smudged onto my upper eyelids, despite me getting the waterproof version. If I may throw a third option into the ring, L'oreal Butterfly has the same separating, feathery look as CC but gives more length and volume."

drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,Mahtiggah,4,Tue Mar 3 14:47:55 2015 UTC,"THE BEST:   The $3 brushes are amazing. I picked up the fancy ten-piece set from their website for like $7 (they were having a ridiculous sale for their seventh birthday or something, this was a couple years ago, so worth), and they're fucking wonderful. I've gotten some to supplement my collection (picked up a couple UBU brushes on clearance for $5 at Ulta, all natural bristles, kabuki, angled bronzer, and powder; an old as the fucking hills natural bristle brow brush from Target that I've literally had since like sophomore year of high school seven years ago; a NYX eyebrow angled brush that I promptly lost and have replaced with an Essence Cosmetics one that's just as great because my eyeliner brush is for my gel eyeliner and not my NYX brow pomade dammit; a couple Lancome brushes I need to give back to my bestie; a Crown double-sided brush that I got from ipsy), but I use them all the time. Especially when I do crazy cosplay make-up. They're so soft and lovely. Also, their gel liner pots are fucking FANTASTIC. I've got the patience for gel liner when I do cosplay or modeling, and it's so worth it. It's buttery smooth to put on, super pigmented, and seriously so hard to fucking smudge. It's the best. Most of their lipglosses are pretty nice, too, tbh. I have two of the 100+ eyeshadow palettes and they're seriously such beautiful colors. There's a lot of variety, and they're ridiculously pigmented. Also, there's a good tonal variety in the browns (both warmer and cooler shades), and even a few warmer greys in my 144 palette. I bought both of the Summer Look beauty book things in summer 2013, and those bronzers are gorgeous. Unf. Still use them religiously. (Downside, I got powder from the bronzer all in the glosses and those are dead. But whatever, I never liked glosses like that. Too goopy.) Their liquid eyeliner pens are pretty good, and you can get them in some fun colors from the website. They don't hold up at ALL on the waterline, though, or in general on the lower lash line. And my wings will fade hard at the corner of my eye. But the colors are super cute! I HAVE BRIGHT TEAL. The little $2 foundation compacts are great when you just want to use powder because you're lazy as fuck. THE FUCKING EYELID PRIMER IS SO AMAZING I JUST WANT TO SING PRAISE TO EVERY GOD POSSIBLE AND IT'S ONLY A DOLLARRRRRRRR I'm in love with the mineral primer, the clear one. It makes my skin so soft that I literally put it on then just TOUCH MY FACE SO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S BABY SMOOTH no but seriously I could go on ad infinitum about the stuff from them I love.   DA WORST:   oh my god they did this weird liquid eyeliner over the summer in like 2013 that was so cool in concept, it had three nubbies and it was so pigmented and smooth, but it leaked hardcore into my eye and I looked like a demon from Supernatural because literally my eyeball was BLACK and it stung a little. it also tended to get weird drips, which then fucked up your eyeliner. (the eye thing was sort of cool in a freaky way, but it also stung, so I mean, no bueno.) The Studio blush/bronzer duo? I tried my friend's, and while I liked the bronzer, the blush was so pale it literally didn't show up. And not like, highlighter pale. Just... Weirdly light. As much as I want to love it, the tinted moisturizer clogs my pores like motherfuck. The lip lock pencil is just weird and doesn't seem to do anything for me. The plumper/primer duo thing doesn't really cooperate. The primer doesn't go on very smooth, and it just kinda makes my lips white and blends with the lipstick? And the plumper stings in a way that really isn't okay, like I'm used to regular plumping stuff (ah, high school), but that's just no. I luck out by having full lips, I guess. The concealer (both tube and the little greasepaint-y guy) is finicky at best. The tube stuff also, weirdly, smells JUST LIKE Fruity Pebbles? And it's super goopy. The greasepaint one would be better if it didn't settle into creases, even with powder. THE LIP GLOSS CRAYONS ARE SO HIT OR MISS. The red settled into the lines on my lips weird, and the pink probably does the same, but it practically matches my lip color so I can barely tell. But I like the minty kinda scent, weirdly. The lip stains super blow. Which is sad, because I'm lazy, and lip stains rock. The pink is literally ineffective, and the red, while starting a GORGEOUS BRIGHT RED, fades so fast in the middle of your lips, like you wouldn't even believe how crazy that shit happens. I work at a Starbucks, and I talk a lot and drink from straws, but holy SHIT that went from red to old New York lady lipliner in like an hour.   THERE YOU GO HAVE A REALLY LONG LIST OF THINGS I LOVE AND HATE ABOUT ELF?  (Also I want to try their fancy liquid foundation but I never could find one to match my skin.)  (Stealth edit to add another one I almost forgot about.)"
drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,Ysenia,6,Mon Mar 9 05:23:38 2015 UTC,"Their studio brushes, the $3 ones with black handles, are amazing. My kabuki brush came from them and it feels the same as an It Cosmetics brush.  I love the lipgloss stick in Movie Star. It's red but not an overpowering red, it moisturizes, and I like the minty smell.  The lip exfoliator is aces, I'd highly recommend it.  Don't bother with the primer. It's good but you get so little of it. The packaging is deceptive."
drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,Dlorian,3,Mon Mar 2 21:16:51 2015 UTC,"I agree about skipping the primer! A little went a long way for me, but it made my dry skin oily. There are much better primers available even at drug store prices."

drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,a_mazz,3,Tue Mar 3 15:09:33 2015 UTC,Best: lip exfoliator  Worst: lip primer. God I hate it so much.
drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,Emac2014,2,Tue Mar 3 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"Best -Contouring blush and bronzer is great! I've repurchased this about 4 times.  - I use their studio line powder brush to apply my foundation, I love it  - The HD blush, while EXTREMELY pigmented, is great and lasts all day -Their blush in Tickled Pink is a gorgeous color  -Their lashes are a steal at $1 and have gotten a few uses out of them each time I've purchased them   Worst -Their volume mascara just doesn't do it for me  -I had a lipgloss from them that was just awful. The applicator just fell apart.  -I had an eyeshadow palette from them and the colors were pretty in the pan but they had no pigmentation and were really tough to work with"
drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,donteatolive,3,Tue Mar 3 02:20:25 2015 UTC,"I agree on the HD blush. It's scary at first because it is so pigmented, but I feel like it really lasts forever because you only need to use so little. It applies evenly and lasts all day."
drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,SoftMetalFoxes,2,Tue Mar 3 15:20:04 2015 UTC,"Best:    I avoid liquid eyeliner, but I know several people who rave about theirs. YMMV. Their Studio Blush Palettes. I have both Light and Dark, and they are seriously really good. The peach shade is my HG and looks simply amazing on my skin. So pigmented. Also, ShopKo inexplicably had them labeled $1, so that was awesome too. Their Luscious Liquid Lipstick. They're somewhat more like glosses, however, if they're applied thickly, they look really  nice. Brownie Point and Cherry Tart are my favorites. Cherry Tart has gold flecks!  Their Studio Tone Correcting Powder. At first I was really skeptical, but I did a half face of this, and it does make a difference. It's not going to replace my Physician's Formula Retro Glow  (discontinued, rrrrh) as an HG finish/correcting powder, as it's not as fine, but it isn't bad at all. Good for a little natural touch up on redness, I just avoid the pink square.   Worst are definitely the white handle brushes from the Essentials line (though the concealer brush is okay) and the Essentials lipsticks. So dry."
drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,abbeyrogue,2,Tue Mar 3 04:38:35 2015 UTC,"Love their black brushes, honestly the Angled Blush Brush is my favourite. Their setting spray is alright - does what it needs to do.   I have their glowing highlighter/bronzer thing? 4 colours in the pan, looks beautiful - does not do a thing for me. There are a couple shades that I can make work but the other two will be tossed when I finish the others (if I ever get there, it's not my go-to).  Their Lip Exfoliator is a excellent. Can't beat the price and it comes in some nice packaging, smells great and does the job well."

drugstoreMUA,2xpgzd,AgentKittyfeets,2,Tue Mar 3 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"Something I don't think I have seen mentioned here that I use all the time is the lock and seal. I don't know the intended purpose but it is great for loose pigments or baked products. I  really like the eye primer, blush, makeup wipes, I have been liking the setting spray I poured it in to my UD spray bottle and its so much better, the baked eye shadow and the little stipple brush UHH I need like 5 of those things for all the cream blush. LOVE   I don't like most of the eye shadows, the white brushes are a dud as we all have found out. There lip products are more miss than a hit but not a total waste.

drugstoreMUA,2xotqv,DrSassyPants,7,Thu Mar 5 04:31:15 2015 UTC,I've seen red used by drag queens under their foundation and contouring to hide stubborn stubble. I'm not sure how effective it is but a salmon concealer stick might help too. I don't have a specific brand to help with that though. Exfoliating before shaving and moisturizing can help a lot though.   I've also heard good things about the new Fergie eye pallet from Wet N Wild. For eyeliner instead of a pencil a felt tip liquid liner might help getting over the fear of eyes stuff. Just don't use it in the waterline.

drugstoreMUA,2xotqv,DawnaBard,4,Mon Mar 2 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"Tweezers and a nice brow kit.  Neutral blush.  Darkish neutral lipstick.  A heavily pigmented eye-shadow that can be used to accentuate upper lid. (I have one in mind, but I'm at work, so I can't figure out what it's called. I'll try to update when I get home and see it).  A nice, dark mascara.  If she accentuates her eyes and doesn't go overboard with blush, it could be a very lovely effect, and I find dark eye-shadow easier to use as liner than a pencil or gel. I find a lot of trans women tend to go overboard on contouring, blush, and bright colors and it's not as flattering as it could be."

Eyeliner: the ColorIcon liner is my HG.  I use the Mink Brown to fill in my brows.  How much do I like it?  I went back to it after a week of using Dip Brow.  It's great as an eyeliner for tightlining too.  It's one of the few I can wear with my contacts without it irritating them. Blush: There's only 4 of them but they're pigmentated like WHOA.   Reserve Your Cabana: My HG highlighter and brow highlight MegaLast Lipsticks: You need to make sure your lips are exfoliated and moisturized, but these are ridiculously nice matte lipsticks.  Considering how cheap they are, they're a good way to experiment with colors you aren't sure of (and there's a few of them that are MAC dupes).   Worst:   MegaProtein Mascara: Ran into my eyes and irritated the crap out of them. The 5 pan palettes: The permanent line up is really disappointing.  The shades in each palette are very hit or miss.  The LE 5 pans were pretty good, and I've heard that they're reformulating the permanent ones soon.  Until they do, pass."

Lasts over my BB cream during an 8 hr shift at work and is very pigmented so I like that I don't end up with powdery cheeks from trying to get it to show. I also have a Fergie highlighter, ""Center Stage Shimmer Pallette"" in rose champagne glow. I wasn't a highlighter user til I began using this one, and I love it too. Probably am too heavy handed with that but yolo. Echoing the nail polish sentiment, the Fergie polishes seriously have the best brush and I liked the colors I got from them.  Realizing how much I like the Fergie stuff especially, I'm feeling an intense urge to go grab a WnW haul... /cries"

Seriously, some say it works too well. It is a little harder to blend over as compared to other primers, but now that I've used it for a long time I prefer this texture. I recommend it to anyone who will hear me.   I also really like their MegaLast lipsticks. The formulas are really hit or miss, but the colors are nice and it's not a big hit in the wallet if one is a flop. I love Sugar Plum Fairy, Cherry Bomb, and Mauve Outta Here."

drugstoreMUA,2x78dx,hectordoesgorug,7,Thu Feb 26 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"The reviews you read did not mention anything because there should not be any burning sensation. I have 2 Revlon just bitten balms, but I never had any reactions from them as you described. However I have been allergic to some lip products previously and it definitely felt similar like you described here. So I thought you might need a heads up, that something in the balm may disagree with your skin."
drugstoreMUA,2x78dx,Helena_Way,5,Thu Feb 26 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I own three and never had this sensation. My first thought was that it's an allergic reaction."
drugstoreMUA,2x78dx,far2frail,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:34:11 2015 UTC,Afterwards I tried it again and it was just a minty tingle so it's probably not allergies. The first time felt more like burning because I wasn't expecting it at all and the shock made it feel worse than it is I think.  I'll do some more research on the ingredients just in case though.
drugstoreMUA,2x78dx,Helena_Way,2,Thu Feb 26 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"Since Revlon is not available in my country I have read and watched reviews of this product, the more detailed ones mention the minty smell or feeling this product has. I think some other lines from them has it too, like the matte balms. So if you get used to it then it won't be a big deal however if you still don't like the sensation of minty lip products then with a little bit research you could avoid them altogether.  I had a little shock with the little lip gloss that comes with Naked 2 palette. The mint in them left my lips uncomfortably cold (like I got toothpaste on my lips and left it there). Especially in winter I don't like any lip product or even shampoo or body wash that does that. I just avoid menthol or mint and I'm golden. So I hope it's just this not mild allergies."

The trick that helped me was I bought some natural lashes as opposed to thicker lashes  and they were good ""training"" wheels- now I can apply any kind. The natural ones are just easier to put on and then you can get the hang of it.  You can use them 2 or 3 times, and I buy them on sales so now I can rock them whenever I want!  For mascara, I second the CG lash blast (Orange) and the CG Lash fusion (Purple)- I have the purple in brown and the orange in black, so I use one or the other err day err day."
drugstoreMUA,2x4k84,nixedreamer,7,Sat Feb 28 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"My favorite is the Maybelline Full n Soft mascara. It's not a mascara for the ""faux falsies"" effect.

I learned that part the hard way because it made one of my eyes turn red from not getting it all the way off. I have no problems with the dry skin cream though. It soaks in nicely, definitely need to use it no less than 30 minutes before putting any primer/foundation on though. It can get greasy feeling if you use too much. My skin gets really dry and tight after I wash it and when I use the dry skin cream it changes that as soon as it's on. My face doesn't dry out during the day after using it."

It's rich without being greasy, and it sunk right into my skin! If it's still not doing the trick, try using a hyaluronic acid serum underneath to help your skin soak it up a bit."
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,pinkertongeranium,1 point,Wed Feb 25 10:31:38 2015 UTC,"Ya I use a gentle cleanser from them and my skin loves it! lol, I find Neutrogena is the only thing that hasn't quite broken me out (or so I think) what hylauronic serum would you recommend?"
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,snesbear,2,Wed Feb 25 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"Check out /r/asianbeauty if youre having trouble finding something a product that works for you, cos they have MILLIONS of recommendations. My personal recs are a light hyaluronic acid serum type product layered underneath an emollient moisturiser with a high water content, and then a layer of oil on top just before you go to bed, either argan or rosehip. A product ive recently fallen in love with is Origins Drink Up Intensive Overnight Mask, but its very very rich and i have oily skin so i can only use this once or twice a week. If your skin is crying out for a moisture hit this may be a HG for you though."
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,Kentorrr,1 point,Wed Feb 25 04:29:16 2015 UTC,Thanks those are some good tips to keep in mind! I'll definitely check into it!
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,Kentorrr,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't found too much that works. On /r/SkincareAddiction they recommend glycerine (breaks me out), hyaluronic acid (does nothing for me), and Squalane (derived from olives).      I'm using Squalane and it's okay but I still have issues. The air where I live is so drying that drinking extra water and overly moisturizing my skin does practically nothing. I'm going to get a humidifier soon and see if that helps any.        I even bought and returned a small travel jar of Philosophy Hope in a Jar as it did nothing for me."
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,jekylll,2,Wed Feb 25 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"If your environment is dry hyaluronic acid will do very little. The trick is to apply it as a layer underneath a very emollient moisturiser, something with a high water content. HA works by drawing moisture to your skin, either from the external atmosphere or the other products on your skin. Once i figured out i needed to layer it hyaluronic acid has become a staple for me and has transformed my skin!"
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,AlyseNovetti,2,Wed Feb 25 04:25:43 2015 UTC,Which moisturizer do you use?      I'm using CeraVe PM and I'm not finding it doing too much to my skin. I feel like the Squalane does more on its own than anything else I've used. I'm debating about getting some rosehip oil and argan oil.
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,callmepeterpan,2,Wed Feb 25 05:14:50 2015 UTC,"Squalene is a great ingredient for dehydrated skin. I use lots of different moisturisers, at the moment i'm using one from theallnaturalface.com that has a variety of different oils and extracts mixed in with glycerin and water, it suits me very well. I use a lot of products from /r/asianbeauty as well, i find they give excellent bang for your buck - high end results at drugstore prices. If you want i can provide direct links to the ones i'm using right now and would recommend"
drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,sleekkills,1 point,Wed Feb 25 05:52:40 2015 UTC,"Ya it could also be my environment just being so overly drying to my skin. We live in a walkout basement apartment, but are moving in a couple of months. I'm hoping once I get a good moisturizer that I'll see a difference! So could I find hylauronic on its own at the drugstore? I know that Neutrogena has a new water gel moisturizer...so many options lol!"

drugstoreMUA,2x2g9x,wittyusernametaken,2,Wed Feb 25 15:03:02 2015 UTC,You might be able to find it at a co-op or health food store.      I got mine online on Amazon.

drugstoreMUA,2x2c9k,Paradise-Kiss,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:23:10 2015 UTC,"I bought one of the new Infallible lipsticks and I wasn't crazy about it.  It didn't come off when I ate  but instead it got sort of wrinkly?  I love the Infallible eye shadows; the texture and pigmentation is great.  I also recently picked up the new tinted brow gel they came out with (I think it's called plumper something?) and I really like it for a quick brow on a workday morning.  The applicator is small enough for detail like the Benefit Gimme Brow.  I haven't tried the gel liner from them (I like the Maybelline one) but in general the best gel liners are smooth and won't tug, so if the makeupalley reviews are good I'd say it's a safe bet."

drugstoreMUA,2x2c9k,woltdosnoy,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:20:17 2015 UTC,Jumping in to say I returned the NYX mascara the next day. They require tons of layers and give very little color playoff. I hate the miss manga mascara too but I use a lash comb to get rid of a lot of the clumps

drugstoreMUA,2wzoo0,McGeezy88,5,Tue Feb 24 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"This is my makeup revolution haul.  This is a review and swatches as I thought drugstoremua would appreciate this.  Let's start with the swatches.  They are of the iconic pro 1, I didn't swatch iconic pro 2 as its a gift.  As you can see the lighter shades really are duds, there isn't much difference between them once swatched.  The darker shimmer colours are probably they best for pigmentation and blending.  The mattes are a little harder to blend out but not impossible.  I've used this palette twice now each time I used nyx milk as a base which I think is a must if you use this palette.  I also dampened the brush for my lid colour which made a huge difference.  The palettes are £6 each.  The double ended brush comes with each palette, I attempted to use the flat side and it hardly picked up any product.  I know my lorac pro 2 palette is pretty well loved but hopefully you can see how similar the colours are between it and the iconic pro 2.  The pro fix spray is 100mls for £5 which is great value for money.  I put my nyx dewy spray for a comparison in size.  There is 60mls in the nyx bottle.  The thing with the pro spray is it has a really chemically smell, once it dries it goes so it's only unpleasant for a minute and it does dry pretty quickly.  It's fairly good at preventing cake, I would say the nyx performs better though.  I have used this twice and I think it's pretty good considering the price tag, however I am not particularly oily and I don't struggle with my foundation coming off throughout the day.    The heart blush in peachy keen was a sample which I really like!  I love peach blushes and its easy to blend.  Subtle with a nice sheen.  It's not overly pigmented but in all honesty I prefer that with blushes as I tend to have a heavy hand.  It had good staying power too.  I did try to do a swatch of this but my phone camera was really struggling to pick it up.  The full sizes of the blushes are £5.  The price point of these products is amazing, of course the lorac pro 2 shadows out perform the iconic pro 2.  If you are on a budget these are a great alternative.  If there is anything I have missed anything please ask me."

Their matte lipsticks are really nice, too, so maybe Divine Wine would be a similar lipstick to Alabama. I don't know if they're dupes, but they're both in the dark red wine family. And if you haven't tried their concealers, I'd say to go for it! I got the Age Rewind one on a whim and it has decent coverage without feeling heavy."

Findation matched me to both 110 and 115. When my natural red goes down I'm actually pretty pale.  I'm not sure if this starburst pink is just that I was lighthanded with application or if I need to find a less pink leaning shade/formula."

drugstoreMUA,2wmfey,whatsupdoc25,1 point,Sat Feb 21 08:53:28 2015 UTC,Maybe I'll try a heavier application then. This one is a lot sheerer than my normal foundation.

I did notice after some time that it did go pink toned which made me look grey as I have warm toned skin.  It also got kinda streaky on my chin which gets oily and cakey even though I set it with powder. I'm not a huge fan of this foundation for that reason now. I usually use the liquid foundation in the glass jars, the Clean Oil Control in 525 Buff Beige and like that one a lot!"
drugstoreMUA,2wmfey,NicoleanDynamite,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:21:39 2015 UTC,It's not a love product that's for sure.  It's a good match for my not pink areas but it really amps where I am naturally pink. A heavier application and ELF tone correcting powder helped some.

I think the value for money on that is fantastic. But apart from that everything else I put on my face on a daily basis is drugstore.

That shit costs two euros and comes from a shitty store brand for teenagers, I can't believe it! I haven't seen any Urban Decay in my life though, so I can't compare, but the numerous reviews seem promising... so a UDPP-like primer is worth two euros, you say? I might just treat myself."

drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,jenniferx302,28,Fri Feb 20 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% on the mascara.  I wear mascara every day, and I can't get through a whole tube in six months (or however long it is you're supposed to keep it).  I'd rather just buy a drugstore brand.

But I refuse to go high end for moisturizer. My aveeno moisturizer works so well that it's all good!"

Oh man, yeah, moisturizer is a huge scam past a certain point, for the most part. I use Simple Skincare's Gel Moisturizer and while it's kind of expensive for the drug store (seven dollars for a somewhat small bottle), it's so good. Sometimes I'll switch it out to for Replenishing Rich or for Nivea... I've tried more expensive ones, but I just keep coming back to those. Ain't broke."

drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,Cameo-Illustrated,2,Sat Feb 21 10:11:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard their lipsticks to be anything special (they have Catrice for that), but their new shade ""Oh So Matt"" is the first nude I have ever liked in my life, in years of trying on everything I could find. And they just put out a new range of nude lipsticks and high-quality baked neutral eyeshadows! Eyeshadows can also be hit and miss with them, I have a great one and a badly pigmented, hard one, but the new baked ones are great. And yeah, they are so underrated! It seems that the US doesn't get a lot of the awesome limited editions, so the awesomeness is cut in half... those are often their best, super exciting products, almost everything I own is LE! Germany is the motherlode of motherlodes for this and other super affordable, interesting brands. So excited to see all the new editions next time I come over <3"
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,teachmetonight,2,Sun Feb 22 10:27:03 2015 UTC,"I'm in the US, and we don't seem to get Catrice, unfortunately! I'll definitely have to scour Essence's small display at Ulta, though, next time I'm there, so hopefully there will be something new!   Ah, bist du Deutsche?  I guess I should have figured that with a name like Ironcat, eh? (ich kann ein bisschen Deutsche, aber...  ein bisschen. I should have continued to study the language). I really like to travel, and I'm not going to lie, when I get the chance to visit other countries again, I'm going to be on the prowl for local makeup. Every country has different tastes and it's really neat to experience that in such personal things as makeup. I do remember that some of Too Faced's items have different names in the UAE, but that's not very exciting. Sephora's Sephora anywhere, I'd rather check Carrefour or something."
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,teachmetonight,2,Sun Feb 22 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"Nee, leider bin ich nur Wannabe-Deutsch :D I have spent a lot of time living in Germany and I love the country and culture, so I try to keep up with the language, and I come back quite often from my current home in East Europe! Which, by the way, is enraging, as here we have wages several times lower than the Western world, but all the products are more expensive... which makes MUA very frustrating a lot of the time. For that reason, going to Germany is really exciting for me as they have all the drugstore brands cheaper and then a bunch of additional ones. And the makeup at the euro store is actually good! O_O Producing cheap, high quality industrial products is how Germany is becoming our new economic overlords, and I'm not complaining... for makeup looks in the street it's not too interesting though, I was instead always surprised how good everyone's skin is and how healthy they look. Although Southwestern Germany does wear more makeup than the East, they have a huge concentration of makeup stores compared to Berlin of all places, and most of my beloved companies are concentrated there.  So yeah, visiting Germany is awesome for makeup tourism, but it's really a bummer that you don't get Catrice! It's barely more expensive than Essence, but is packaged for adults, has a somewhat wider product range, higher quality for some things and also puts out really exciting limited editions! I look at MAC ""limited editions"" and can't wrap my head around what's supposed to be interesting there... Catrice and Essence just basically release every possible product for each new trend and then some, just to see what sticks. It's a real shame that a lot of these collections aren't available abroad."
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,jamiiiiii,5,Sun Feb 22 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on mascara. I love my MAC and Bourgois (not high high-end, but definitely higher end on my spending scale, lol), but honestly, Maybelline works pretty damn well too.  For bold, bright lip colours which I'm still getting used to rocking, I prefer to stay on the cheaper end of things (ELF, Nyx) because I don't know how often I'll use the colour - even though I love owning the colour, lol.  I'm all about drugstore buys for my eyelash curler as well as lip balms (as you said) as well.  I can't bring myself to skimp on foundation and concealer. I feel like it's so important to have a good base. And smudgeproof black pencil liner. I wear that every single day, and I really don't want to have to work to keep it clean and non-raccoon-y throughout the workday, which I find happens with cheaper pencils - either it smudges terribly or vanishes completely."
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,FriggityFrack,3,Mon Feb 23 08:06:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah - I have a pretty big lip products box, it's my favorite thing in makeup. I have maybe four higher end lip products? Basically, I don't need that funky shade in MAC when it's a shade I bought just for fun.    I wish I'd gone in for higher end concealer and foundation   a lot sooner. It really improved my makeup overall to not be frustrated with having to work with a base that wasn't good enough.   I don't really use pencils, but I totally know what you mean. No one wants that melted halo look."

drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,NoxNeno,5,Sat Feb 21 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"Im pretty stuck on going mid-high end for eye shadow. I've been really disappointed by most of the drug store brand eye shadows now that I have things like the Lorac pro and Chocolate bar- I'm spoiled. Mascara, I have one I like that more on the high end but I really dont care, I'll use anything. Lipstick I'll use anything because I want to try ALL the things."
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,redydg,3,Sat Feb 21 06:34:34 2015 UTC,"I'm devoted to the $10 sample size of They're Real mascara. I figure it's almost drugstore prices, and I have very short, straight lashes that need all the help they can get. So I always go high end for mascara and concealer.  But I'll always use drugstore for lid primer, eyeliner, lip balm, setting powder."

drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,outrunningzombies,2,Sat Feb 21 01:02:37 2015 UTC,"I've tried TONS of higher-end mascaras and eyeliners but the best ones I've used are from the drugstore! My two best friends swear by high-end mascara but it's a waste of money - at least for my lashes - they look much better with my drugstore mascaras. I've been using the same eyeliner for years and I'll never change (Revlon). I 100% agree with you. I also use drugstore blush, lipsticks (NYX is my favorite of course), and lip liners.  I'm picky about my shampoo, conditioner, and hair products (not exactly makeup but you get the point) as well as my powdered foundation and BB cream - I always go high end on those. Also, concealer because of dem circlez :(  I used to use drugstore stuff for my eyebrows. I use dipbrow now and I've also used IT cosmetics brow power but I think you can get some pretty solid brow pencils at the drugstore.  I'd say I'm about 50/50 with drugstore and high end products. I've found you just have to experiment with what works best on you - sometimes that means splurging on the higher end products and sometimes it means buying drugstore :)"
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,paperclip1213,2,Sat Feb 21 04:30:10 2015 UTC,"I've tried drugstore for everything and have had a solid relationship with MAC and Sephora for a couple of years now.  Mascara is something I NEED to go drugstore only on. I just bought a purple MAC Mascara because I couldn't find purple anywhere else. My other MAC Stuff has great brushes with it but the formula is so so and it burns me so much that I'm having issues with $25 mascara.   Eyeliner is strictly Essence in either Fine-Eyeliner pen or Midnight in Paris. The Gel pot is the exact same as my Fluidline.   I have to go Mid-High end for Foundation, MAC has more shades and I've found it doesn't oxidize on my skin at all. I go MAC For my shadows too, I've just had more luck with them and honestly there is a larger variety all in one store. So I'm lazy and satisfied."
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,Alora44,2,Fri Feb 20 16:51:45 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on mascara for sure. I have similar lashes in how I'm pretty happy with them; they just need to be curled and darker. Otherwise, I am all over the place! I tend to prefer mid-range eyeshadow and mid/high lip stick, but I still love trying new products from all over the place."

I have pinkish/neutral skin with a full face of freckles and I've only found that MAC NW15, NW20, and N2 work. Other brands, including benefit, MUFE, Kat Von D don't even have a match. If anyone can let me know if they have a dupe for these colors I would love to know about it."

They are as good or better than mid- to high-end. Lip balm: For real tho. Skintone concealer: Maybelline is bae. Natural to moderate-drama mascara: CoverGirl and L'Oreal have this covered for me. Cream and cream-to-powder eyeshadow: Maybelline and L'Oreal outperform high-end any day. Nail polish: I have a few high-end ones, and none of them come close to my Wet N Wild or Revlon polishes.   Mid- to high-end only:   Color correcting under-eye concealer: The drugstore hasn't come out with anything that's the right consistency or color for me (yet). Powder eyeshadow: I've found that eyeshadow palettes actually aren't a bad value (~$4/shadow for the Naked palettes and ~$2.60/shadow for the Lorac Pro), and I do notice a big difference in quality. Foundation: Again, the drugstore hasn't come out with anything that gives my UD Naked Skin or Estee Lauder Double Wear a run for its money (yet). High-drama mascara: Anything from the drugstore that has come close to Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara has ended up flaking on me. No me gusta."
drugstoreMUA,2wjyn6,FriggityFrack,3,Fri Feb 20 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"You're really not kidding about Maybelline's cream eyeshadows. So, I haven't owned many cream shadows before, the ones I have I'm not super excited by. Today that changed when I found a Color Tattoo at Dollar Tree buried in a bunch of random stuff, and decided to see what it was about... No exaggeration, it might be one of the best eye products I've ever tried at any price point. What a neat product - I really hope I can find more.   Powder eyeshadow, too, I generally agree. I've come to prefer loose eyeshadow anyway, but palettes below mid range can be so hit or miss.  I have plenty of drugstore palettes, and like most of them, but..."

I agree with you on drugstore palettes. It's hard to find one that ticks all the boxes. I find the ones with good pigmentation aren't as blendable as I'd like, and the ones that are really blendable have poor staying power... Screw it, I'll just pay a little extra for the good stuff!"

For drugstore, I love the Revelon Colorbust Matte Balm in the colors Elusive and Striking. Elusive is a more pinky-nude color and Striking is a bold red color. But I love using Striking if you barely put some on and kind of blend it it; on me, and probably you, it can look like a gorgeous darker pink color."

Also the Loreal Julianne pink (just saw someone else mentioned that one as well). I also like the Loreal in Fairest Nude (pinky color).

drugstoreMUA,2wk2ji,horse__tornado,2,Mon Feb 23 06:55:40 2015 UTC,Redhead here! I always gravitate twards either a brownish neutral or hot pink fuchia. My favorite is maybelline 10h lip stain gloss in pink plush. I think it is discontinued but if it isn't please let me know!!!!!!! Redheads can handle more contrast on their face without it being overwhelming since their features are dramatic as is. I'm also a fan of berry and fire engine red. Stay away from light pastel/ petal pinks with lots of blue undertone. As long as you stay on the warmer side of things you'll be fine

drugstoreMUA,2wbq7l,nutmegs226,3,Wed Feb 18 17:44:51 2015 UTC,I think maybe they don't stock them around here then. Mascara around here is a sea of dark black/ebony/blackest black.

I so you say that you would only use black if the formula is amazing, well what makes a formula amazing for you? Different mascaras will do different things to different types of lashes. So one formula type is amazing for short thin lashes versus someone like me who has long, thick lashes ya know?  I like Maybelline The rocket Volum' Express as my all purpose mascara. I also though like to layer mascaras, so I would use clump  crusher as my 1st application and then build with The rocket or another. Cover girl Lash Bast and Clump crusher I think work well for a lot of people."

The brown shade is really nice though! It's a true brown, not too red or too dark.  It doesn't do much for my lashes, but I seem to be in the minority there. There's nothing actually bad about it though, like it doesn't flake or smudge or anything. I've seen pictures where people get really fantastic results so it's worth trying just for the fact that it's brown."

I went through at least 2-3 bottles before trying something else. I would definitely rebuy.  To me it felt like the foundation actually was absorbed into my skin instead of just sitting on top of it. Likely because its a very thin formula, it goes on very smoothly and blends so well. I found that when I did get oily and blotted the foundation wouldn't come off on my blotting paper which was really nice."

It really reduced my need to blot my cheeks and nose during the day. I've recently been trying the new L'Oreal Infallible pro-matte 24hr foundation and setting spray, and it's working out great."

drugstoreMUA,2w3dpb,GoblinTart,6,Tue Feb 17 18:33:06 2015 UTC,"Revlon whipped foundation. It's horribly patchy on me, slides right off after an hour, and is really cakey. I've tried using it so many times with different primers and techniques but doesn't even compare to Maybellines BB cream (which I love and gives great coverage while not being heavy).   Nyx eyeliner markers are great for a few days and then they dry out.   Nyx baked blushes are really hard to get onto my brush. I almost just want to grind them up and use them as a loose blush powder."
drugstoreMUA,2w3dpb,abbeyrogue,3,Wed Feb 18 04:39:51 2015 UTC,Yes! Revlon whipped is cakey beyond cakey on me. I look like I applied a silicone based and tried to use a water based foundation over it.      But cakiness has been an issue I've always faced. I've found ways to minimize it but not fully get rid of it.
drugstoreMUA,2w3dpb,yesmydarling,3,Mon Feb 16 21:20:09 2015 UTC,Same. I've accepted that full coverage will never be a thing for me. I just wish my skin wasn't so splotchy and gross.
drugstoreMUA,2w3dpb,abbeyrogue,4,Tue Feb 17 02:56:53 2015 UTC,Is it the NYC blushes that everyone likes? Cause I hate those. Way way too much pigment for me. I end up looking like a clown no matter how much I knock off the brush before applying.
drugstoreMUA,2w3dpb,smilesbot,3,Tue Feb 17 08:52:47 2015 UTC,"Try the powder blush in Dusky Rose. I am very fair and it looks so natural on me, it's got bown-ish undertones and it's a pretty neutral so I think it would work well on most fair to medium skins.

I will admit it is super cheap - but there you go. Might I also mention that I live in Canada, where the entire Fergie line is not available, so I have not been able to try anything and I DO see lots of kudos for the primer.  Their lip products never last on my face. I've purchased 2 of the bigger palettes and was again, disappointed. I can make them work if I do 2 or 3 more steps than I usually would and even then the colour payoff isn't really worth it.  All this Hype around Elf eyeshadow palettes? Why. I've been given the Endless eyes set and a multi-set that Winners had with blushes and lipstick and whatever, but the pots for eyeshadow are tiny and the payoff is pathetic (lip products and blushes were fine). Even over primer, I have to get product on by brush 4-5 times before colour starts becoming opaque.  Have not tried the single shadows, maybe it's because of the pots being so tiny that contributes to the crapfest I own, can anyone confirm their shadows are better than what is in these palettes?"

I keep trying to use them and I think I've just got the wrong skin tone for the palette. The greens lean a little too cool and though a greyish browbone color would probably look nice on someone with darker skin than me, it's just completely the wrong thing on my eyes.   I DO dearly love Megalast lipsticks, but I think Maybelline's 14-hour lipsticks come in a better range of colors (WnW Megalast leans very dark, and it's tough to find a natural-looking everyday shade), have a better scent, and have better wear time."

I have tried the Age Rewind AND the FIT Me concealer, and neither work due to their lack of colors.  I don't think FIT ME is on par with the NARS RCC that everyone seems to compare it to. NARS is slightly drier and not as slick. I like that formula. The NARS one you need a little bit to get what you wanted covered. It has more pigmentation with less usuage."

The suit paint is SoHo Acrylic Urban Art Paint  I CAN NOT rave enough about the Ben Nye products. This product is opaque (bright white and deep black - no streaking), goes on smoothly with a paint brush, it doesn't smudge (only comes off with soap and water), and I have so much more left. It's this little compact the size of store bought eyeshadow and it barely looks like we put a dent in it. A little goes a LONG way. So if you are ever going to dress up as a kabuki, geisha, black swan or do any theatrical makeup to yourself, go Ben Nye. You won't regret it.   On top of that, the cakes cost $7 each that I bought at my local theater store, which I just found out about.   And I know you're wondering, ""How much did I photoshop this image"". 99% of the photoshop was done to my hair - lol! It had a dent in it from me banding it down to shellack my sides down of my afro to create the illusion of the box haircut. Bumped up the levels and brightness and this is the result.

drugstoreMUA,2vz6ub,sadcatpanda,5,Sun Feb 15 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"There are a couple tricks I've found help my foundation last a bit longer.   The ""Goss Method."" Basically, you buff a thin layer of your powder on before you apply foundation, and then just set your foundation afterward in the spots where you tend to be most oily (for me, it's my T-zone and chin).  Spritz on a thin mist of setting spray before and after you apply your foundation. I've never used WnW face powders (other than blush), but I've had trouble getting their blushes and eyeshadows to last more than a couple hours. Try switching to a more long-wearing powder, like Rimmel Stay Matte or Maybelline Dream Wonder. This last solution is the most expensive, so I saved it for last. Sephora liquid foundation isn't known for being very long-lasting. I haven't tried it personally, but most people I know who have, have gotten rid of it pretty quickly because it just doesn't have any staying power. If the other tricks don't work, it may just be time to switch to a more long-wearing formula."

Revlon Colorstay is pretty good, though. If you're like me and have combo/oily skin, this is great. Skip it if you have dry skin, though, because it will cling to dry patches.  I've also heard good things about Neutrogena's and Rimmel's foundation. My sister swears by the Maybelline Mousse one, too."

drugstoreMUA,2vwbo5,WasabiPeaAddict,4,Sun Feb 15 01:16:38 2015 UTC,I used to love their eyeliner pen. Then they went and changed the tip and it's three times wider than the old felt tip and I can't figure out how to use it without looking a fool.  Terrible photo but a good photo wouldn't save this.

drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,ghostthecoast,16,Thu Feb 12 16:02:46 2015 UTC,Only problem is that now I have to figure out my skin tone .... Can never figure out if I'm warm or neutral. Haha
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,ladyanneboleyn,4,Fri Feb 13 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"The only way I ended up figuring it out for myself is because so many drugstore foundations in the palest shades lean very cool-toned, and oftentimes come off comically pink on my skin."
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,clitulhu,2,Fri Feb 13 05:12:28 2015 UTC,I know I had luck once someone suggested to me to look at the veins on the inside of my wrist. I was fairly sure I was cool tone (but my skin tone is mostly neutral so I can still get away with warm tones) and my veins are blue instead of green which is why I just go with cool tones
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,wildebeesties,6,Fri Feb 13 04:01:15 2015 UTC,"Sometimes my veins look green and sometimes they look blue. That usually indicates neutral tones but when I wear neutral foundation it looks too pink. However, most warm toned foundation don't seem to match either.  I'm an enigma."
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,ladyanneboleyn,5,Fri Feb 13 04:08:17 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I'll olive but incredibly pale actually which makes all the warm, neutral, cool stuff not quite fit for me. Usually olive undertones are medium to deep so there's not much out there for fair olive. Sigh... It sure gets complicated."
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,ladyanneboleyn,3,Fri Feb 13 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"I'm light medium olive and true match warm seems to come pretty close, though I sometimes blend it with neutral. I'd give the neutrals or warms a shot!"
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,whisker_patrol,4,Fri Feb 13 04:20:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried the rest of the line, but I only tried one of these and actually really didn't like it! I have n3-4 innocent flush, and it is a pain to work with. You get a lot more glitter than pigment on application, and the pigment wears off very quickly and you're left with what looks like just glitter on your checks. I might have gotten a dud, but I recommend not choosing that color if you can avoid it since OP likes the rest s/he has tried!"
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,therambunctiousotter,2,Fri Feb 13 06:59:23 2015 UTC,"So weird, the one I picked was a bit shimmery, but it didn't look glittery or anything once applied. Might just be that shade."
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,therambunctiousotter,3,Fri Feb 13 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"It looks shimmery in the pan, but was straight up glittery on the cheeks. Though like I said, it might have been a dud. Oh well guess that means it's time to give them another shot!"
drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,lexxy18,2,Fri Feb 13 14:42:28 2015 UTC,Nope not a dud. Same thing happened to me. I wear n4 foundation in the winter and n5 in the summer and this blush doesn't show up on my skin at all. It looks like some liquid glitter I got as a kid from Claire's. :(

drugstoreMUA,2vnu1e,wittyusernametaken,4,Fri Feb 13 10:14:57 2015 UTC,"They have about 4 shades per skin tone, which is nice. Darker blush for winter, lighter for summer."

drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,riderriding,2,Thu Feb 12 00:04:52 2015 UTC,I LOVE this highlight. It is so beautiful and natural looking for me. Plus it's huge and super cheap. I totally recommend it as well.

drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,malevolenceisavirtue,2,Thu Feb 12 01:18:58 2015 UTC,Oh I don't think it looks bad! I am just not brave enough for any shimmer.
drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,missaeiska,3,Thu Feb 12 05:07:41 2015 UTC,"It really does not feel shimmery at all, it looks really natural IMO! But that may be because I'm so used to super shimmery over the top highlighter..."
drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,Arriettys_mom,3,Thu Feb 12 05:29:32 2015 UTC,It's more of a glow rather than a chunky shimmer glittery highlight.
drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,StrobesNQueens,2,Thu Feb 12 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely not shimmery. I own this one too, and on my face it was almost too subtle (needed to build it up, methinks), at least compared to other highlighters (Hard Candy Tiki, for example). I can post comparison swatches tonight when I get off work if you'd like."

drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,mscarsonelle,3,Thu Feb 12 05:34:28 2015 UTC,Those are my natural lashes! I put aquaphor in them every night and they're super long and thick. I only need a light coat of mascara.
drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,mscarsonelle,2,Thu Feb 12 09:37:28 2015 UTC,Oh wow! They look out of this world fantastic!  Were they always this luscious or did the product help?
drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,MissyTX,3,Thu Feb 12 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"Not at all, they used to be super short and stubby. I'm so surprised more people haven't heard of this tip. Look up ""eyelash growth vaseline"" for info. You can use any type of jelly like that, aquaphor or vaseline or whatever. Even castor oil. Has also helped make my eyebrows more dense and growing them out has sped up a ton!"
drugstoreMUA,2vlg50,amandamaea,2,Thu Feb 12 19:35:17 2015 UTC,"I literally just grabbed the Vaseline next to my bed and coated my entire eye area in it! Of course id heard the Vaseline tip when I was younger but it hadn't worked for me(maybe I didn't try it for long), I think I will buy the aquaphor product and hope for the best. I have very sparse brows where the hair doesn't opaquely cover my skin so encouraging hair growth is top priority."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,shadowsandmirrors,20,Thu Feb 12 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"Mine would be the Revlon Just Bitten Kissable Balm Stains, specifically in Rendezvous (Orange), Sweetheart (bright pink), and Romantic (red). They're HG status for me. I like layering Rendezvous and Sweetheart for the perfect coral and they make for great stains under other lipsticks as well."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,mathsnail,4,Thu Feb 12 07:04:06 2015 UTC,"I have rendezvous and smitten (fuschia ish) and man, they are so stupidly easy to use but with an amazing finish and staying power."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,recycledpaper,3,Thu Feb 12 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, I still need Smitten. Don't know why I don't have it yet. And yeah, great staying power AND even fading once they do start to wear off. Fading evenly is so important! Super low-maintenance lip colours; if only they added more to the line. I'd love a rosy MLBB tint since Honey is a little too mauvey for me."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,mathsnail,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:21:38 2015 UTC,I just tried one a couple weeks ago and was unimpressed by the swatch but gave it a try anyways.  Well a swatch doesn't do it justice because it takes a little while for the lips to stain with this product and it looks so gorgeous.  I think I need more
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,Zabnut,4,Thu Feb 12 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"You definitely need more. You're right, they don't swatch great. It's on the lips that they really shine! I love how long they last and that they fade evenly so you don't have to worry as much about maintenance."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,mathsnail,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest these exact three colours! Smitten is great too, but it's stain is quite similar to sweetheart once the initial colour wears down."

drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,unicornsexisted,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:52:25 2015 UTC,I use the pointed foundation brush from the real techniques core collection just to apply the color to the area then I blend it out with a knock off beauty blender. Then I go in with bare minerals original mineral veil and a little more powder contour in the form of NYX taupe.
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,mandarin_duckling,11,Mon Feb 23 04:55:56 2015 UTC,"Maybelline Superstay Lipcolor . Holy shit. This is the best lipcolor I've ever used. Every expensive lipstick I own flakes or fades after an hour, and they completely dry out my lips.   Not these. Today, it lasted through an entire shift at work, where I was testing acidic coffee for 8 hours. Normally, my lip color would have needed reapplying multiple times for that sort of day, even with primer. Even products that have been sworn to be long lasting. This $9 product is godsend. Go get it."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,quin_violet,2,Thu Feb 12 07:04:20 2015 UTC,"Right?? I've been preaching about these. It stays perfect through kisses, meals, and even dental visits, my dentist finally asked what lipstick I was wearing, she was so impressed. It beats MUFE aqua rogue and sephora cream lipstain by far. Completely transfer proof too, which is rare."

drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,Prettyundead,10,Fri Feb 13 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"Revlon lip butters. They're just the perfect lip product for me. They're lightweight and feel nice, and I love that they go on sheer, because I need work-appropriate makeup but even bold lip colors can be fine with a sheer application. And I can build them up if I want more opacity. However Fig Jam was one of my favorite colors and Revlon discontinued it and I'll never be over it, ever. #foreverbitter"
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,ghostthecoast,7,Thu Feb 12 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"Wet N' Wild blushes. Pretty colors, not powdery AT ALL. The only one I don't like very much is Mellow Wine but that's just because it looks bad on my skin tone. They go on nicely and do not budge. My foundation will all disappear by the night but that blush is still there. Absolutely can't beat it for $2-3."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,supermodella,4,Thu Feb 12 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"NYC liquid liner is the best I've used, ever. Worth every penny. It's deep, dark black. It isn't too shiny, nor too matte. Doesn't flake, doesn't run, doesn't smudge. The only draw back is the brush, but that's probably just me.  Because of my terrible vision, I have a really hard time using those long bristle brushes. I need either felt tips or, as in this case, I just use a tiny angled liner brush."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,nutmegs226,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:14:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. I tried this once. Loved the formula, could not handle the brush and had to take it back."

I reach for it more than my dipbrow. It's pigmented, long lasting, and easy to apply. You only need a small amount so the tube is gonna last a long time. At $7 you can't really beat it."
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,girkabob,4,Thu Feb 12 02:57:25 2015 UTC,Essence blushes. These blushes are extremely pigmented but go on the skin so naturally. They are muted colours so it never looks like you rubbed bright pink powder on your face and give a natural flush.
drugstoreMUA,2vlypa,CinnamonBunBun,2,Thu Feb 12 14:19:00 2015 UTC,The brow gel is something I must have from their line.

I was looking for a drugstore dupe for Benefit's Porefessional and even posted here asking if anyone knew of one. I got several recommendations and was thisclose to buying a different one (L'Oreal Youth Code Texture Perfector) when I saw how cheap this one was in comparison ($10 less). The cheapskate in me said I had to get it, and I am SO glad I did.   It has a bizarre consistency when it comes out of the tube but once you start applying it to your face, it warms up and goes on smoothly. It made my skin look SO good today that if I wasn't going to work and was just running errands instead, I probably would have skipped foundation. That's unheard of from me! When applying it, I make sure to take it up under my eyes too and my undereye concealer has never looked better!

drugstoreMUA,2vmdbn,juliaaemm,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:52:33 2015 UTC,"I do like the concept of having a ""by request"" blog or youtube channel, the only issue is finding viewers to provide you WITH requests.  Finding viewers can be a big endeavor involving lots of time on social media trying to lure people to your page (I know this, I just started a YT channel and blog myself!  lol).  When I started my YT about 3 weeks ago, I had a few ideas up my sleeve for videos and I've been filming and  uploading those.  I figure once I start getting a bigger viewing base then I'll open it up for requests.  Taking requests with no audience means you'll kind of be stuck to start off.  Also keep in mind that just because a few people requested a certain idea it doesn't mean everyone else will be interested in reading about it, but that's just like any beauty channel.  :)  Perhaps you could start off with material that you AREN'T seeing but WANT to see, personally, and then open it up a request line for your viewers.  It's a lot of work but if you do it for your own enjoyment, like I do, then it will be worth it.  I just really enjoy a creative outlet for writing, which is why I started a blog to accompany my channel.  It's just an overall fun experience.  :)  Good luck!"

The whole audience thing is my major obstacle; I'm currently operating on a different blog and I'm starting to hoard requests so I have some to work from when I do decide to transition to my other idea!

drugstoreMUA,2vmdbn,eyesonallison,1 point,Sat Feb 14 00:04:52 2015 UTC,"I think one thing missing could be tutorials for makeup of various ages.  Like teenage makeup is different from young adult makeup is different from middle aged makeup is different from older makeup.  Skin textures change, eyelids droop a little more, you don't want to be rockin' the hot pink crease when you're in your 40's so much.  So many beauty people concentrate strictly on the young adult bracket (like early 20's) that those in the ""outlier"" category are missed.  I'm in my early 30's and feeling that transition (bye bye oily face, hello sahara desert! lol).  While I do what I wanna do with my makeup, I know some people older than I am aren't into experimenting so much and aren't into shimmer EVERYWHERE as it does accentuate pores, fine lines, and the ""non smooth"" bits that come with aging.  Keep me posted on how this goes for you, I, too, get tired of seeing the same.exact.thing over.and.over again!  :)"
drugstoreMUA,2vkiqc,nutmegs226,6,Wed Feb 11 19:53:17 2015 UTC,I've found personally whenever I use a waterproof mascara the formula is definitely drier than a non-waterproof one.
drugstoreMUA,2vkiqc,jippityjuniper,4,Wed Feb 11 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"Can't think of a really dry mascara off the top of my head, but I can say that every Rimmel Mascara I've tried has been a very wet formula, so you probably want to skip those.   Maybelline's The Rocket isn't really dry or wet, but on me the effect is similar to about 3 coats of Clump Crusher in one coat of The Rocket, so you may like it.  Waterproof mascaras do generally tend to hold curl better than regular formulas."
drugstoreMUA,2vkiqc,Erinescence,3,Wed Feb 11 21:53:43 2015 UTC,L'Oréal Voluminous Carbon Black. It starts off wet (which I hate) but after it's been opened for a few days it dries down really well.
drugstoreMUA,2vkiqc,cherrychapstick007,2,Thu Feb 12 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"ELF mascaras tend to be dry. Their waterproof is very easy to apply precisely because of the brush and the dry formula, but I'm not sure about how well it holds curl since I don't curl my lashes.   Maybelline the Falsies waterproof is pretty dry too.  Stay away from Jordana extreme volume if you're looking for dry. I love it, but it is the wettest mascara I have ever used."
drugstoreMUA,2vkiqc,arcana_floridiana,2,Wed Feb 11 23:48:40 2015 UTC,"Covergirl Full Lash Bloom is good and dry and gives nice fluffy, soft volume. It's a lot like Clump Crusher but gives more volume."

drugstoreMUA,2vhmln,medaox,7,Wed Feb 11 02:38:50 2015 UTC,"I second this.

drugstoreMUA,2vhmln,Aaaandiiii,3,Wed Feb 11 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"Ditto. As a dark-skinned woman, I can only use their eyeliners and I gotta say, they make up for the rest of the brand not being compatible with my skin tone.  You learn how to do your liner right because if you make a mistake, there's no smudging it away real quick. Nope, you are stuck with that line until you get some kind of makeup remover into the game.  Also, their gel liner is good too if you like that kind. When I wipe the excess off the brush onto the back of my hand, I definitely have to put in some muscle to wipe it off. It's not as long lasting as the liquid, but it's def awesome."

drugstoreMUA,2vhmln,darthval,2,Wed Feb 11 08:07:17 2015 UTC,"It worked pretty well for me! At the time I was using it the most, I was relying on it as a zit cover-up. I'd dot it on the zit, and add a tiny bit of Cover Girl foundation over top to camouflage the area more. I'm very pale, and my zits (and the scars they leave) tend to be REALLY freaking obvious. This stuff seemed to neutralize a lot of the ""LOOK AT ME! I'M A GIANT HORMONAL ZIT FROM HELL!"" kind of redness, but naturally, it had limitations. It definitely helped, though.  Maybe check and see if it's been reviewed recently on MakeupAlley or somewhere similar?

drugstoreMUA,2vhmln,PinkPonySwag,1 point,Wed Feb 11 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"Me too. I bought these enormous eyeliners in a tri-color set (blue, green, & purple), and everything about them was terrible. They were hard to apply and they disappeared almost instantly. The pigmentation was so minimal. The tip was too long and unwieldy, so it quickly broke off at the base. Plus, they couldn't be sharpened, so the point became a huge blob after the first two uses. 3/10 do not recommend."
drugstoreMUA,2vhmln,PinkPonySwag,2,Wed Feb 11 15:45:20 2015 UTC,"I have heard some good things about the 'warm nudes' palette. It's a block that has maybe 14 sections, and you can use them together as a bronzer, use only certain ones together as a highlighter, or use each individual section as an eyeshadow. I haven't tried it personally, but I've had my eye on it for a while.   I generally don't like their shimmer strips eye shadows. They tend to look nice in the pan but be quite bland once applied.   That said, I'm a fan of their powder face products, especially the tone-correcting powder compact."

I don't know if this is true of every CVS, but my local one allows returns for cosmetics even after they've been used. Again, that's got to result in more wasted product than just providing a tester and letting people get the color/consistency/finish right the first time, right?"
drugstoreMUA,2vijxg,Kentorrr,2,Wed Feb 11 12:19:38 2015 UTC,Well in the UK you can't return opened cosmetics at all! So I guess we get testers but no returns. :/
drugstoreMUA,2vijxg,minniemumpy,2,Wed Feb 11 12:28:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we did that, but came up with nothing...hence me asking the larger community."
drugstoreMUA,2vijxg,PinkPonySwag,2,Wed Feb 11 09:38:08 2015 UTC,"Okay sorry, that was just the best advice I could give. :)"
drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,featherlite91,7,Wed Feb 11 02:39:45 2015 UTC,My recommendation is NYX's matte lip cream in Addis Ababa! It has a creamy matte finish (not so sure about the satin though) and is close to that pigment. Here's what it looks like on me: http://i.imgur.com/2rYWCb7.jpg   I can swatch it for you tomorrow if you'd like but I'd still recommend NYX's matte lip cream line regardless. They go on super smooth and last a considerable amount of time. Retails at about $6 at Target.
drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,yydnic,3,Wed Feb 11 06:00:21 2015 UTC,"That looks amazing on you!!!! I have Transylvania and Copenhagen, but their formula is a little patchy, but I have heard the lighter shades are better. I need to get my hands on this shade! Too bad the Targets in Canada are closing and have empty shelves.... Guess a US trip is in order!"
drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,yydnic,2,Wed Feb 11 06:29:42 2015 UTC,I think you can get NYX at Ulta too and thanks! This is my favorite color.
drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,Captain_Hooker,2,Wed Feb 11 06:36:07 2015 UTC,The closest ulta is like 3 hours away. So guess Bellis Fair Target will have to do!

drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,violaviolin,4,Thu Feb 12 00:27:55 2015 UTC,Maybe NYX matte lipstick in Street Cred? It's a very vibrant warm toned pink
drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,crayolasand,5,Wed Feb 11 04:06:32 2015 UTC,It's such a tricky color based on lip undertone.  That's a more intense version of what Revlon lip butter in sweet tart looks like on me.  But otherwise it looks similar to WnW megalast in don't blink pink.
drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,unicornturtle,2,Wed Feb 11 06:05:36 2015 UTC,"I have sweet tart! But I feel it is a little too sheer, but I may try it with a lip liner."
drugstoreMUA,2vhqkk,JulezMcCoolz,2,Wed Feb 11 06:26:08 2015 UTC,It reminded me of one of NYX's Intense Butter Gloss in Napoleon.
drugstoreMUA,2vcozs,GracieInColor,5,Mon Feb 9 22:52:15 2015 UTC,"I grabbed a couple of these, blue and green (didn't see the purple).  I don't adore them, but I do like them.   Also keep an eye out for various Milani nail polishes, eyeshadow, and lip products, NYC Applelicious Glossy Lip Balms and eyeshadow quads (they're pretty good!), and Maybelline nail polish! The dollar store, my brand."
drugstoreMUA,2vcozs,SoftMetalFoxes,4,Mon Feb 9 22:59:38 2015 UTC,"Ok. So I tried them and my verdict is: As a smoky eyeliner they suck. It takes multiple swipes to get an opaque line and even the it is still a bit patchy. The ""smoker"" is more like an eraser removing product and gummily pushing it around (like a roseart eraser). I don't think that there any way to get a smoky eye with just this product, it doesn't even make a good upper eyeliner... That being said it is nice and soft with a decent tip and seems to stay put after a couple of minutes of dry time. I quite like it for tightlineing.   Overall 3 1/2 out of 10 stars...based on original suggested retail price. If I had paid full price for this I would be pretty pissed, as it is pretty crappy as an eyeliner and does not ""smoke"". But for $1 I'm going to use it for tightlineing."

drugstoreMUA,2vdcs2,ChompskiHonk,6,Wed Feb 11 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Got them yesterday with the buy two get two deal. When I tried the first one on I was really disappointed because it had quite a bit of shine, but if you give it a good five minutes or so to dry down a bit they're really beautiful! They transfer like nobody's business though, so watch out for that."
drugstoreMUA,2vdcs2,ChompskiHonk,3,Thu Feb 12 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"Aww. The transfer thing might be a deal-breaker for me. I usually don't get to check a chance to check my makeup more than once every 4-5 hours during a typical day, so I'm trying to find products that will stay put and that I don't have to worry about re-touching often.  What colors did you get? Do you like them overall?"
drugstoreMUA,2vdcs2,M_tridactyla,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:25:12 2015 UTC,"I got Striking (mauve-y), Passionate (cherry red), Allusive (vampy plum), Stirring (vampy oxblood). While still wet, they feel a lot like the NYX matte lip creams and can move around quite a bit. The nice thing is that they move a lot less after they dry, but it takes five minutes or longer. The first two colors are fantastic, the second two which are darker still look great but I'm definitely going to wear a liner under them just because they can look a little patchy. No fragrance which is nice, and the packaging is nice and sturdy. If I had to pay full price for them, I'd probably just pay a few extra bucks to get the Sephora matte lip colors just because I already have a few and they set much faster. The buy two get two with a coupon definitely made them worth it though.   EDIT: Forgot to add that one thing that tips the scale for me is that they don't settle into every line in my lips like the NYX creams do."

drugstoreMUA,2vdcs2,tabemasuuu,3,Wed Feb 11 05:46:33 2015 UTC,"Late to the post but I just bought 3 of them. They're veryyy similar to the NYX Soft Matte lip creams in that they don't ever really dry down to really matte (like the Sephora cream lip stains or the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks) but are definitely not glossy. The colors are very nice and don't feel drying at all. Just don't expect kiss proof, all day color."
drugstoreMUA,2vdcs2,AlyseNovetti,2,Thu Feb 12 04:59:42 2015 UTC,"I have found the NYX ones to be very long lasting and am a huge fan of Copenhagen, but I wish NYX had more dark colors. They have sooo many nudes in their Soft Matte Lip Cream line, but so few pinks/purples/reds.   How long would you say these last, in comparison to NYX? And what colors did you get?"
drugstoreMUA,2vdcs2,WHOLOCKinOCTOBER,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:22:18 2015 UTC,"I love Copenhagen! I only have Copenhagen and Amsterdam and find I can get about 3 hours without touch up with the NYX ones as long as I blot and layer a few times when applying, but right out of the container I get about an hour or two before touch up. I totally agree though, not a fan of the abundance of brown nudes in the line!   I got Allusive, Striking, and Stirring. Stirring is pretty close in color to Copenhagen, and Allusive seems to be similar to Transylvania.  Here's swatches with flash. Top to bottom: Striking, Stirring, Allusive, NYX Copenhagen  http://m.imgur.com/ARaxraL  I can't really say for wear time yet, but I wore Stirring for about an hour today before eating and it held up the same as NYX, though I think the Ulta transfers more as it doesn't seem to get as dry."
drugstoreMUA,2vdcs2,SoftMetalFoxes,1 point,Thu Feb 12 08:49:36 2015 UTC,"At first I thought for $9 each they should definitely be better than the NYX ones, but that buy 2 get 2 free deal is pretty tempting."

I tried the ones the Essence makes but I wasn't a big fan of them. I know that the NYX Jumbo Pencils are popular on here, but imo they kinda suck. They're greasy and they never set. Expect major creasing if you're not setting them with eyeshadow (even then they do crease on me, while hardly anything else does! I have dry-ish eyelids)"
drugstoreMUA,2v8vjk,Ysenia,2,Mon Feb 9 01:25:17 2015 UTC,Every time I am in my local CVS I see the Milani ones and I'm tempted to buy them but I don't. Mostly because I'm unsure how to blend them....do you use your fingers or a brush? I am curious.
drugstoreMUA,2v8vjk,Chlorinolda,2,Mon Feb 9 16:39:33 2015 UTC,I use my fingers personally. I feel like the warmth from my skin helps with the blending.
drugstoreMUA,2v8vjk,iamsc,2,Mon Feb 9 17:27:33 2015 UTC,I second this. I just put it straight onto my lid then blend with my index finger.

It was a duo, with one side being the eyeshadow and the other side being a complementing eyeliner. I love it! As long as you put a primer on, it stays on pretty well! I also has a NYX one and I love it as well. I will say that when I used it the first time, I absolutely hated it and swore them off for good but that was years ago when I wasn't into makeup at all. This time around, I did think it felt a little weird on my eyes, but after a few wears that weird wet/heavy feeling wore off! The Wet n Wild one was about $1.99-$2.99 I believe? Worst case scenario is you don't like eyeshadow sticks, but still get an eyeliner out of it!"

It feels lighter and smoother to me & gives about the same coverage. Rimmel felt tacky/sticky and doesn't last as long in my experience. It is more dewy, but I actually didn't like that all over. Lumi is still dewy without being over the top, and I can use other products to build a glow instead depending on how much I want. Revlon Skinlights is amazing for that, I also will use Almay Luminous Primer, but that does not work for all skintones since its very pink, it's kind of a love it or hate it thing. Those and argan oil are my dry skin favorites."

drugstoreMUA,2v8g98,aflowerysong,4,Mon Feb 9 22:20:50 2015 UTC,I just started using Revlon nearly naked and it fits all of your criteria except the bottle has no pump. Its light/medium coverage that looks incredibly natural and doesn't cling to dry patches. I think the lightest shade has pink undertone too. Its definitely worth looking into . I got it at Wal-Mart for  $6

drugstoreMUA,2v8g98,aflowerysong,2,Mon Feb 9 22:23:13 2015 UTC,"I mix ivory and vanilla in nearly naked, I think? The two lightest shades. And the lightest, which I think is ivory, is pinker than the next shade up. The darker shade is a perfect match for me till it oxidizes, hence the mixing, and I lean more toward the warm shades in l'oreal (but I mix in a bit neutrals with them to get a good match) so it may work for you?"
drugstoreMUA,2v8g98,Kentorrr,2,Tue Feb 10 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"I've tried both l'oreal true match lumi and rimmel match perfection. Match perfection in the US doesn't come with a pump, heads up. I couldn't find an exact match for my skin (I'm about w1-2 in lumi, sometimes mixing in n1-2 but the neutral is too pink once it oxidizes a little on its own on me? the shades of rimmel I could find were too dark or too pink) but both were really similar in finish and I like both. I'm more normal skin than combo/dry but some of my sunscreens tend to make me more oily and benzoyl peroxide gives me dry patches occasionally and they didn't accentuate dry patches and with powder and blotting I got the oiliness under control. Coverage is light-medium for both, so up your alley for sure.  Bourjois healthy mix is really similar to the rimmel but ""better"", from what I've read. I ordered shade 51 from ebay and I'm still waiting for it in the mail so I can't compare right now, but it comes with a pump!   I managed to find a close match in rimmel's 25 hour foundation (I'm 91, light ivory - a little pink but workable) and it's similar to the match perfection, though thicker (takes a while to dump onto my hand. And it used to come in a squeeze bottle in the US and they changed the packaging to this??? What even, rimmel!) and dries more semi-matte than dewy. I like it! May be a bit too high coverage for you but it's spreadable and is more on the medium side than full, I think?"

drugstoreMUA,2v8g98,NerdTurtle,2,Thu Feb 12 10:04:25 2015 UTC,"It's the tone rehab, the one without sunscreen in it. If you haven't already, I strongly recommend not using chemical sunscreens (avobenzone, oxycrylate, etc) and switching to physical sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide). Chemical sunscreens tend to dry people's skin out and cause breakouts. Also, you can apply physical sunscreens after serum/moisturizer and underneath foundation, while chemical sunscreens have to be applied directly to the skin before anything else."

And when I say beauty store, I mean the kind that's run by Asian people that sell nothing but Black products. Hahaha! THAT beauty store. My 'go to' beauty store :) And the lipstick tube will either say 'RK by Kisses' or 'Ruby Kisses'. That have a decent sized product line. Happy hunting! :D"
drugstoreMUA,2v5bs4,avalanchethethird,3,Sun Feb 8 06:03:08 2015 UTC,Holy eyes. I can't do eyeliner at all. Ever.  I dont own any pencils anymore and only have an elf liquid liner marker thing and am afraid to try :(
drugstoreMUA,2v5bs4,chalkhearts,4,Sun Feb 8 03:00:55 2015 UTC,"I found out that I can't use the liquid liner that's a brush. I tried for months, but my lashes kept getting in the way and it just looked awful. Then I finally found one, like you, that is like a skinny marker with a point tip.  It was LEAPS AND BOUNDS EASIER to do liner using that point tip! I still mess up, but that's what the Q-tip dipped in makeup remover is for - lol! It took me two times to get the wing on the right eye the same as the wing on the left eye. Ha! But now that I have a tool that I can use effectively it'll get easier with practice, and I KNOW I need more practice. ;P  Give it a go on a lazy day (like today was for me). Go on Pinterest or YouTube, find a quick tutorial, turn on some tunes and try a new look. If you mess up, who cares. That's the beauty of makeup remover and wipes.

drugstoreMUA,2v5nyn,shadowsandmirrors,3,Sun Feb 8 03:08:31 2015 UTC,I took a photo the ELF display at one of the local 7-11s. I don't know how common they are and obviously they're smaller than a drugstore display. They seem to be at different places in the store; this one had it near the travel stuff but the other one has it right in front of the door.

drugstoreMUA,2v3qgp,wildebeesties,1 point,Sat Feb 7 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"I share this fear!  I recently saw them on clearance at Meijer (grocery store in Michigan/Ohio), and had to stock up."
drugstoreMUA,2v3qgp,wildery,5,Mon Feb 9 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"I still like the original Rimmel BB Cream the best. It's got an SPF of 25 and gives the most coverage of the drugstore BB Creams I've tried.  I'm oily, so I wear a primer under it and a powder over it. The shade Light is a good match for me, but the shade range is  very limited."
drugstoreMUA,2v3qgp,Erinescence,2,Sat Feb 7 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"This s my hands down favorite, but it's been scarce at my stores. I have the nyx but it's wears like a lotion (like oil of Olay) so I have to wear powder over it. What I like about BB creams is it was like one and done. I'll be following this thread for suggestion if my Rimmel bb is oos."
drugstoreMUA,2v3qgp,Verliezen,2,Sat Feb 7 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"Rimmel revamped their BB Cream line so that there are now 3 varieties and the packaging has changed for all of them.  Some stores have put the original on clearance so they can put in the new display.  The original BB Cream was in the same size/dimensions of packaging as the primers.  The new packaging is taller and thinner, so the whole display has changed.  Most, but not all, drugstores in my area have switched over to the new displays. Rite-Aid seems to be the only one that hasn't.  (The 3 varieties available now are the Original BB Cream, BB Cream Matte and BB Cream Radiant.)"

drugstoreMUA,2v3qgp,Erinescence,2,Sun Feb 8 03:11:08 2015 UTC,Natural is most likely the original. The other two are BB Cream Matte and BB Cream Radiance. Here's a picture of a special display with all three formulas.

drugstoreMUA,2v3qgp,cali4nia_dreams,2,Sun Feb 8 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously two hours of wear isn't going to tell me much.  But I've been wearing the natural finish Rimmel in light for a couple of hours.  My thoughts so far: I like the coverage for 'normal' days. I can tell I'm wearing something but it's not a full face of foundation either. It runs just a touch light on my skin, so I don't know if it's going to handle summer face but it's also cheap enough I can get a bottle of medium and mix them for summer. It also leans a touch yellow on my skin but I'm also a fairly pink person-and a little powder seemed to cut the yellow down.   I might get a tube of Fergie in light/medium closer to summer to handle my tan (I pick up color looking at pictures of the sun while wearing spf 75+. It's a losing battle).  Not an awesome photo, but at least it's natural light. Also not my best face but I don't plan on leaving the house and I don't feel well.

I'm not against picking up a product I've never heard about, but I've heard about the Rimmel before.   I thought it was weird that I hadn't heard anyone talking about the BB when everyone seems to love the primers."

The Rimmel is also pretty alright."

So dosing it is a delicate balance. I don't use it often because I'm afraid of running out... but it cost me two damn euros for the whole tube, so I dunno what my problem is, hurr"
drugstoreMUA,2v3zqq,JoleneAL,1 point,Sun Feb 8 06:07:13 2015 UTC,"The best one I've found is Ulta Matte Prime. It's a little pricey for a drugstore primer ($18), but their line of cosmetics goes on sale all the time. Right now it's buy two, get two free, and you can still use coupons on top of that.  The primers that did nothing for me (in terms of oil control) were NYX Studio Perfect Photo Loving Primer, Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer, E.L.F.

I just received the Milani ones the other day and was very impressed...glide on smooth and densely, more like the UD ones. The Nyx ones aren't too far removed from the Mac, maybe a little less on the color payoff in one swipe. But that's fine for a liner that's going beneath lipstick.  The Nyx ones have been sold out everywhere since the Black Friday sales, I think. The Nyx and Ulta websites have been picked over for ages, and my Ulta never has them restocked when I'm there. That's what led to me grabbing the Milani ones.  Might be worth looking at Rimmel, as well."

Love it and has extra room for some of my other brushes.   More information: The set I got was the black/black set not sure about the colored sets.   The powder/blush brushes are soft and fluffy.  The foundation/concealer brushes were not better than what I had but are by far not the worst I have used. The eye shadow brushes range from loose and fluffy to the ones I like that are a tad firmer and can with stand some blending.  I of course do not follow what they are labeled there is a really deep angled brush that says its for brows but I use it to line my top lid, it just wings so nicely.   The small fan brush I felt it was dingy and useless, I got use out of the large one as it had more bristles but, the small one didn't hold color well and in my opinion didn't have enough bristles.   Just all my opinions I hope they work out for you, can't really beat it for $30."

Elf based in Germany only ships to Germany, Austria and Poland... NYX is at Douglas although not the trendy new items. I'd be interested if learning about other options!"
drugstoreMUA,2uviyu,eisenkatze,4,Thu Feb 5 15:49:28 2015 UTC,"This is relevant to my interests. I'm also in Europe (Finland, to be exact) and have been trying for the past several years to find a reliably hookip.   Makeup Revolution sells worldwide through their own website, and occasionally has sales or extras. Sleek also does the same, and every once in a while has a code to waive shipping costs.   Be careful with some UK sites as they might ship from the Channel Islands or somewhere that isn't inside the EU VAT zone. You might have to pay customs. That used to be the case with FeelUnique, but I think they've changed this.   iHerb has ELF, Physician's Formula and natural brands, but I've been unimpressed with the quality of 'natural' and mineral makeup in comparison to the more conventional stuff. They sell ELF for about 1.5-2x the price in store, but there are ways to get discounts. If you haven't ordered from there before, ask someone else for their discount code. They'll get a little bit back in commission and you'll save something like 5%. Every little bit helps.   East End Cosmetics does sell NYX but it's all discontinued or old stuff, not so much the new stock. Fragrance Direct can occasionally have newer products for deeply discounted prices, and they recently started stocking MAC for near full price.   Kosmetik4less.de has Essence, Catrice, WnW, MUR, some Revlon, Sleek, and pretty much everything but NYX. I ordered from them in the middle of December and got my package within a week. But my taxes and shipping costs added a good €12 to my bill, so I don't think I'd order from them again. Their prices are slightly inflated but not nearly as bad as, say, Nelly."
drugstoreMUA,2uviyu,Misogynist-ist,3,Fri Feb 6 05:32:56 2015 UTC,"I live in Netherlands, I emailed NYX representative in Europe, and they said the eyebrow gels, wonder pencil etc will be released in Douglas this year :) They told me to be patient and start saving money, haha. As for Elf and real techniques I got them from iherb. Bol.com sells real techniques and Revlon though the price is a bit high. Max factor is the same company as Covergirl."
drugstoreMUA,2uviyu,mandarin_duckling,3,Thu Feb 5 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"It depends where in Europe! Amazon is the obvious choice, you can generally find most things on there. There are also discount websites like fragrance direct or make up fairy that stock some American ranges. Beautybay.com stock a few of the higher end brands. All of these are UK websites...except amazon...."

But when I got home and swatched, all three seriously came out pretty much the same color. It's like I bought three of the same shadow. Admittedly, the colors I bought aren't drastically different in the pan, but I was expecting more. I was also disappointed with the pigmentation and opacity. Now I only use then over other shadows to add a bit of shimmer.  The colors I purchased were: Bella Pink, Bella Rose and Bella Champagne.  They are all shimmer and have the same formula, so I am still really interested in trying the more matte shades to see if they are any better."

The colour tattoo pigments had a few duochrome shades if you can find those still (the pink one had a blue shift). I can't think of any other drugstore brand eyeshadows I own that have that are duochrome sadly.

drugstoreMUA,2utf08,CatEarsAndButtPlugs,2,Thu Feb 5 00:51:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I suppose that's to be expected, and re-pressing them isn't hard. I just get annoyed having to clean up afterwards, lol"

drugstoreMUA,2utf08,CatEarsAndButtPlugs,2,Thu Feb 5 00:56:18 2015 UTC,I dropped the palettes. The plastic didn't break but the powder did - popped right out of the pan and broke all to pieces.

However, I've frequently heard that their studio lip exfoliator is really great. It's something I intend to purchase in the future, as a dry-lip-bitter. To prime my lips now, I'll dab Chapstick on as I begin my face. Once I get to my lips, it's usually soaked in and I'll line and apply as usual."
drugstoreMUA,2urwib,crayolasand,6,Wed Feb 4 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"I use NYX's lip primer pretty much every day and I have no complaints. When I get out of the shower in the AM, I scrub my lips and apply some Rose Bud Salve. Then whenever I am ready to do my lipstick I'll slap on some of the NYX Primer, line my lips and then apply whatever lip color I'm using that day."
drugstoreMUA,2urwib,KlimRous,6,Wed Feb 4 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"I love my NYX lip primer. This has been my routine:   Lip balm after the shower. Wipe off right before I do my lips, which is the second last step in my routine (blush is last). Line lips with my ELF clear liner (I'm not 100% sold on this). Fill in my lips with my NYX primer (really like this product). Line my lips with my lip liner that matches my lipstick as closely as possible. Fill in my lips with my lip liner, but only lightly, so I don't waste lip liner (lol, it's expensive for such teensy amounts!) Apply my lipstick. Blot. Apply again."

I use vaseline on before bed and throughout the day and that works very well for me (I have dry lips too so if I don't moisturize lips, I get flaky lips)  Also, drinking lots of water and staying hydrated helps."
drugstoreMUA,2urwib,lifesaboxofchocolate,4,Wed Feb 4 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"I don't prime either (actually didn't know it was a thing); I use a brown sugar scrub before I do any makeup, then throw on a waxy Chapstick until I'm ready to do lipstick.  By then, it's absorbed enough that it's not super thick, and it keeps my lipstick from skipping."
drugstoreMUA,2urwib,PinkPonySwag,2,Wed Feb 4 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"I bought the NYX primer yesterday, so we'll see how it goes. I don't wear lipstick often, I'm just now getting into it, but I've seen the ""omg a primer makes a world of difference!"" mostly with foundations and eyeshadows, so I figured lipstick would be roughly the same. Even with long wearing lipstick it'll rub off if you wear it long enough, I was just looking for something to help smooth out the application and look rather than staying power. I got a NYX matte lipstick and after an hour it'll separate from my creases, like if I smile you can see the gaps in the lipstick. that's mainly what I'm trying to prevent."

drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,geekygirly,5,Sun Feb 8 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yesss I am all about this one, it's the perfect shade. I'm also obsessed with the Plum Perfect shade."

drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,graveyardgirl,2,Wed Feb 4 15:16:00 2015 UTC,"I was worried it would be too brown (I already lived through the 90s once, thank you). But it's a really flattering color! I was so pleasantly surprised :)"
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,geekygirly,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:52:30 2015 UTC,I was worried about that too as I've heard that it looks really different depending on your skintone. Thankfully for me its definitely more red.
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,graveyardgirl,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:21:15 2015 UTC,I love H&M lipsticks! They have nice colors and they last a long time for me. I have a hot pink one that is probably my all time fave.

drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,aliceinconverse,3,Wed Feb 4 18:11:34 2015 UTC,WnW is just so amazing. While doing Inventory I realized I had about 12 WnW lipsticks. That made them the biggest part of my collection. (Nyx coming in close second). They were BOGO free so I went crazy with it. No regrets.

My other favourite from that line is ""Love That Pink,"" which is a great reddish pink.   Revlon Balm Stains are AWESOME. I use them as stains/bases under most other lipsticks, actually. Sometimes I combine Rendezvous and Sweetheart to make a nice coral :)  Another favourite are the L'Oreal version of YSL Glossy Stains. Their actual name escapes me now and I couldn't find them when I was last at Shoppers, so I'm worried they're discontinued, but those are great IMO."
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,lalala_meh,7,Wed Feb 4 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"NYX Simply Vamp in Aphrodisiac. It's described as a plum brown, but it's more of a dark red brown on me and this sucker stays put. I also jumped on the Soft Matte Cream train and really love London. I wanted Abu Dhabi but it was out of stock at my Ulta; either way, it's nice to find a product that lives up to its hype.  As far as a traditional bullet lipsticks, I actually really like some of NYC's, even their $.99 priced ones. They're great for layering."
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,lalala_meh,4,Wed Feb 4 18:17:53 2015 UTC,The Matte Balm in Sultry is my jam. I love that shade.

Some slowly turn bright orange, which put me off buying it again. There used to be quite a few threads about it when they first came out, but I can't find them, unfortunately. Some say that only certain batches are affected because when they purchase another of the same colour, it doesn't change that way."

drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,PinkPonySwag,6,Thu Feb 5 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"I'm am totally loving Milani Naked matte and Naturally Chic as well as Maybelline's Touch of Spice. They are all MLBB, but aren't drying on the lips and go on incredibly smooth.  I'm in love and no way I feel it's okay to spurge on a high end lipstick knowing how well drugstore brands can perform.    Also, my favorite all time red, is Rimmel Kate Moss #11. It's a true blood red and is BEAUTIFUL.  Holy cow I love it.  I would wear it everyday but it's a color that can best be pulled of for special occasion(especially in winter). When I first put it on, even my husband loved it!  And he's not too crazy about red lipsticks."

drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,ImaCheeseMonkey,4,Wed Feb 4 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"I think my current favorite is Maybelline Divine Wine, but berry/wine colors as a whole right now are my jam.

Red: For matte, I like the soft matte cream in Morocco. Otherwise, I love the Butter lipstick in Mary Janes.  Pink: Soft matte cream is Addis Ababa or Butter lipstick in Little Susie.  MLBB: Round case lipstick in Tea Rose or soft matte cream in Cannes.  Wine/Darker shade: Butter lipstick in Licorice."
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,cherrychapstick007,2,Wed Feb 4 19:24:33 2015 UTC,Hahaha I know the struggle. Color selections was perfect and acceptable! Nyx is perfection when it comes to their lip products!!! The only product I wasnt too happy with was Little Susie... Until recently. I realized I was putting it on all wrong and once I applied it properly (less pressure and not in such a rush) I FELL IN LOVE. Its witchcraft I tell ya.
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,shadowsandmirrors,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say near perfection. I've noticed that their lighter colors, ie the Butter lipstick in Hubba Bubba and round case lipstick in Strawberry Milk, went on very patchy and settled into creases almost immediately. I think I might give them another shot once I have a proper primer in my armoury."
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,SoftMetalFoxes,2,Wed Feb 4 17:37:24 2015 UTC,I haven't tried either of those so you may be right!

drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,emocanadian,4,Wed Feb 4 19:40:28 2015 UTC,I would say probably my overall favorite color is Maybelline Warm Me Up.
drugstoreMUA,2uqpl6,coldheartedx3,4,Wed Feb 4 20:13:26 2015 UTC,E.l.f Rich Red lip crayon is my absolute favorite red lipstick.

drugstoreMUA,2uq9xp,janee346,3,Wed Feb 4 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"I have used both the Dewy & the Matte one and they are literally the same thing for me. Both of them did nothing for oil control and left me a grease-y mess within hours. I was really let down by the matte one because I had such high hopes for it. I thought the coverage was decent for both though, maybe a bit better for the matte one."
drugstoreMUA,2uq9xp,AlyseNovetti,2,Thu Feb 5 01:55:45 2015 UTC,If you like the dewy look more I would try that one and use a mattifying powder where you tend to get oily
drugstoreMUA,2uq9xp,heyitsmel,2,Thu Feb 5 05:48:15 2015 UTC,I purchased the Matte + Poreless one a few days ago and I used it for the first time yesterday. It's really runny but at the same time it's hard to blend so it doesn't look cakey. I wore it for less than five hours before I had to buy makeup wipes and wash it off in a mcdonald's bathroom because it had oxidized so I was orange and made my skin suuuper flakey. It's also caused me to break out a little on my chin. All in less than five hours so i'm pretty upset.   Definitely buy it from somewhere with a good return policy if you try it. Just in case it doesn't work with your skin
drugstoreMUA,2uq9xp,featherlite91,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"So I have the original Fit Me and the Fit Me Matte+Poreless. I am oily so I prefer the Matte WAAAAY better. With the original one, I am glistening within the hour. If dewy is your cup of tea, and you tend to be more dry, definitely go with the original one for sure."
drugstoreMUA,2uq9xp,SpinnerettePDX,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I have both and still prefer the dewy version. I like the matte version well enough but I have normal/dry skin and just prefer a more luminous finish. I do still like the matte version- it's essentially the same as the original- but personal preference I opt for the original version more. If you have oil control on your mind, opt for the matte version. Get it somewhere that has a good return policy and try it out just to be sure!"

drugstoreMUA,2uq9xp,duffkira,1 point,Sat Feb 7 07:36:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried the dewy+smooth but I just got the matte one and it is MATTE. I am usually someone who powders up a lot after foundation (due to combo skin and the preference of matte skin), but with this foundation I don't even need any powder. The downside is it's hard to get a good color match, I'm 120 classic ivory in the original fit me but for me, the 120 in the matte version is more orange so I'm going to be purchasing a foundation whitener and using it because I really like the formula but the orange, not so much. And the other shades around 120 seem pinky, and I can't use pink tone foundations. But if you want matte, I am loving this foundation. It lasts all day, does a good job of hiding my pores (which are huge), stays matte, and I haven't seen it rubbing off on my boyfriends face/clothes like other foundations which is a plus! This would be my drugstore HG foundation if it matched perfectly, but honestly I'm still on the hunt for a drugstore foundation that matches my skin tone perfectly."
drugstoreMUA,2uqdj4,jennjenn09,3,Wed Feb 4 06:55:47 2015 UTC,Are these done over primer or just your skin?   I didn't know elf and Maybelline even sold loose shadows but they look pretty good! How are they compared to the bareminerals ones in use?
drugstoreMUA,2uqdj4,mommafatpimp,2,Wed Feb 4 08:53:30 2015 UTC,"Oops, I forgot to mention, they are over ELF's mineral face primer in tone-correcting green (I didn't want to waste my UD Primer Potion). I actually like the Maybelline loose shadow as much or better than the bare minerals, because there is a lot less fallout from the brush to under my eyes (even using the same brush). They're generally really pigmented and feel light with no creasing issues. The ELF shadows are very nice as well, but don't have that strong pigment that I like. I find that I use them more as accents rather than as my main shadow color."

My kids have been out of diapers for years, but I'm still buying 3 packs of Target's Up & Up Unscented Sensitive Skin Wipes (they come in the purple pack) any time I'm there.  They're nice and thick and soft and textured and they get everything off.  CVS' store brand unscented sensitive skin baby wipes are just as good."

drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,Bo_Peep,2,Wed Feb 4 04:19:09 2015 UTC,"I like the baby wipes too, but they don't always work on eye makeup.  I usually hit my eyes with a tiny bit of coconut oil, then wipe.  Good stuff."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,frumperbell,2,Wed Feb 4 14:33:10 2015 UTC,I use Mineral Oil on a q-tip.  Especially if I'm wearing a Color Tattoo or liquid eyeliner.
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,snesbear,2,Wed Feb 4 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"I do this too.     Instead I use butt wipes for sensitive skin (non-scented). I have never had issues with it taking off all of my makeup nor have I had issues with breaking out from it.     I have used baby wipes from Aldi, Equate butt wipes, Up&Up [both butt & baby] wipes, and Walgreens. The ones from Walgreens were more expensive so I quit buying them.    Keep in mind I'm a [frugal] lady though and try to keep everything I buy to a low cost but at a quality where I'm not compromising too much (ex: not buying the $1 baby wipes which don't hold moisture in them and fall apart almost instantly)."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,whatsupdoc25,9,Wed Feb 4 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is technically drugstore but I use the Wal-Mart equate facial wipes. I also have combination skin, oily in the t-zone and I find that these are great for removing makeup.  I usually follow up afterwards with Neutrogena's Light Night Cream to give some moisture back, especially on my dry areas like my cheeks.   I have found while these are good for eye makeup they also sting my eyes a bit and I am worried about dragging on my eye skin too hard so I will use Maybelline's eye makeup remover for washable makeup soaked on a cotton pad then placed on my eye for 30 sec and it does great! Followed by an eye cream gently patted on, I use a Neutrogena one.  My skin feels and looks great!"
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,heatsensitive,2,Wed Feb 4 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"I came here to say this! I love the Equate ones in the green wrapping... they take all of my makeup off and there are so many in each package. I sometimes get the stinging feeling too, but it's rare enough, and they are good enough at everything else, to deal with it."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,whatsupdoc25,2,Wed Feb 4 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"Glad to know I'm not the only one that got the burny feeling haha. I avoid using them on my eyes now and substitute with an eye makeup remover and haven't had a problem with burning on the rest of my face so I'll stick with this method as it's so cheap.  I have a container but I think it's equivalent to the blue package, not sure though"
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,jacks_a_million,2,Wed Feb 4 04:14:57 2015 UTC,The equate ones burned my eyes so badly.

drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,heyitsmel,1 point,Wed Feb 4 00:30:05 2015 UTC,"I have the ones in a plastic container, but I'm pretty sure it's just a container version of the ones in the blue package.  Personally, I will keep using them as I think they're great for the face, but yeah they are not the best on the eyes. The eye makeup remover I use is great but I suppose it does mean I'm buying two products as opposed to one. Still though, both come to about $10 total so it's not that pricey."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,kolbin8r,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:13:06 2015 UTC,These are my HG face wipes! They do burn a little if the liquid gets in your eyes but nothing a quick wipe of a damp cloth can't fix. They always seem to last me for-friggin-ever too which is nice.

drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,LaMaklovia,5,Wed Feb 4 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"I swear by the CVS generic cleansing and makeup remover wipes. I think they are supposed to be the generic of the Pond's, but IMO they work way better and are much more gentle than the Pond's. I buy them in huge value packs when they go on sale for BOGO50%, and keep a pack stashed everywhere. They also sell them in the 5 piece travel packs which is perfect for stashing in purses. I used to be terrible about taking my makeup off, but now I almost never miss a night because these wipes make it so easy.     Also, while I think the blue Neutrogena wipes are slightly more effective at removing stubborn waterproof eye makeup, I too got the weird film from it and they  break me out."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,oryx_and_caKe,2,Wed Feb 4 00:46:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like the weird film they leave behind is the reason they take off eye makeup so well. Some kind of oil or something in it. I get the same feeling from them as I do from Almay eye makeup remover pads and from coconut oil.  I have a CVS fairly near my house, just two blocks or so away. I've heard good things about their coupons. I may have to start looking into those."

drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,SecretCitizen40,3,Wed Feb 4 01:05:44 2015 UTC,I love the Yes to Cucumbers wipes (I haven't tried any of the other Yes To....brand for wipes because I like these so much). I definitely prefer them to the blue package Neutrogena (and the CVS version of the neutrogena). They do have a scent though.
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,oryx_and_caKe,2,Wed Feb 4 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"I'm usually okay with scents - the cucumber and sage ones I use now have a scent to them, though the scent itself doesn't irritate my skin."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,shadowsandmirrors,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"I tried these, I liked the smell but I felt like they tore up my face. I couldn't quite figure out if it was the cloth themselves or the makeup remover but something about it just made me feel raw and not happy :( I've been afraid to try any other 'say yes to...' products since then."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,redydg,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know how similar they are (you'd have to check the ingredient list), but I have found a difference between the strains of Yes to....(cucumber vs. tomato vs. grapefruit vs. carrot) with some of their other products like facewashes."
drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,mandzie,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:51:44 2015 UTC,I have heard that too people saying they love one kind but hate another. Cucumber I figured would be pretty gentle but it didn't work for me :( Maybe if I see some travel sized ones of different kinds I will try them. Just not worth buying a big pack in case it wasn't a cucumber specific issue.

drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,AlyseNovetti,3,Wed Feb 4 02:44:39 2015 UTC,"The neutrogena makeup remover wipes (blue package) take off eye makeup the best.

drugstoreMUA,2uoysh,spandxlightning,2,Wed Feb 4 02:56:09 2015 UTC,Simple wipes are great. I use the oil control ones and I love them. So much better than Pond's that I used to have.

They have a nice refreshing smell to them, make my face feel clean and get off any leftover makeup that the mineral oil didn't get off.

drugstoreMUA,2ujrb2,aspiringmermaid,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:40:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like I can't comment 100% on longevity because if my lipstick comes off a few hours later I'm usually just like 'meh' (unless it's a darker color). But I'd say both the Kate and Moisture Renew are pretty good. They do have a scent to them though (the Kate ones more so) which kind of bothers me. They're not matte, so I wouldn't say that the staying power would be amazing, but as far as I know they're good."
drugstoreMUA,2ujrb2,oatmeal_pie,3,Mon Feb 2 21:59:46 2015 UTC,Awesome list! Thank you so much for posting this.  Which ones would you say were the best/worst as far as formula/quality?
drugstoreMUA,2ujrb2,pastelcoloredpig,4,Mon Feb 2 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"All of them are pretty good with pigmentation. There are none that I just absolutely hate. I haven't worn a lot of them for an entire day at a time, so I'm probably not the best at talking about the longevity of most. But I'll give you a few things that stood out to me on some of them...  The NYX Round lipsticks are great, but they are very creamy. For darker colors this means that they are unforgiving when applying them so you have to be careful or they'll slide everywhere.   I love Milani and NYX Butter Lipsticks. Good formula.  The Maybelline Color Sensationals are great. There are so many colors and the formula is good.  Wet n Wild are good for the price. I think they're like $1.99 or $2.99. They are matte, so I make sure that I exfoliate and moisturize my lips well before I wear them because they can be drying. If your lips are dry, I could see the formula just not really working out. The same with the NYX Matte Lipsticks. But they're long wearing because they're matte.   Rimmel Moisture Renew and Kate Moss lipsticks are both good ones. Moisture Renew are really hydrating. Both of these have a scent though, and I'm not a fan of lipsticks with scents. The Kate ones are very floral. The Moisture Renew kind of smell like sunscreen to me (there might be sunscreen in them)  Maybelline Color Whispers aren't very pigmented, but I think that's the point. They're more like a tinted balm, but they are more 'watery' for lack of a better word. Very hydrating. I tend to use them over lipsticks that need a bit more moisture.   Loreal Black Cherry is my least favorite. It might just be me/my skin coloring, but I found it hard to apply/patchy, and it just doesn't look great on me.   I hope that answered your question"
drugstoreMUA,2ujrb2,Ysenia,3,Mon Feb 2 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"Very much so, super informative and helpful. Thank you!"
drugstoreMUA,2ujrb2,betziboo,3,Mon Feb 2 21:59:27 2015 UTC,You aren't alone on L'Oreal Black Cherry. The consensus seems to be that it's a fabulous color but very patchy and uneven.

drugstoreMUA,2ulw1b,Reddoll22,8,Tue Feb 3 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe l'oreal true match in W1, that one definelty has yellow undertones."
drugstoreMUA,2ulw1b,mariettee,8,Tue Feb 3 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"You could try L'oreal True Match.  They have a fantastic range of shades and three different undertone lines (warm, neutral, and cool).  If you need your foundation to be more yellow, you'll want the warm line up.  ColorStay Whipped is also a good option if the Combo/Oily was a good match.  It's still full coverage, but it doesn't feel as heavy going on.  If you really liked the CG 3 in 1, there's one shade lighter: 805 Ivory.  CoverGirl's TruBlend line might work as well.  Here's some swatches."
drugstoreMUA,2ulw1b,frumperbell,6,Tue Feb 3 14:11:24 2015 UTC,The Whipped version. It's not so heavy and can be sheered out with a Beauty Blender. It feels like nothing on my skin.   The regular colorstay version can feel like a mask.
drugstoreMUA,2ulw1b,cherrychapstick007,4,Tue Feb 3 13:47:35 2015 UTC,"I think Revlon Nearly Naked 120 Vanilla could work for you, but it's a dewy finish so I think you would have to set it with a powder. It's slightly more yellow and a tinge darker than 150 Buff."

Still, the lightest shade in most foundations is sometimes too dark. And as far as undertones, foundations tend to be either too yellow, too pink, too orange, or just muddy on my skin. I've been told that I have neutral-peach undertones but I also have mild rosacea which tends towards a little bit of redness on my cheeks and chin. I keep trying, with no real luck."

For the soft matte lip colors I only have three I believe. I like them, but I honestly probably wouldn't repurchase them. Your lips have to be well hydrated or sometimes some of them might stick on to the dry patches of your lips, for example transylvania. I usually wear my matte lip colors over some of my matte lipsticks to deepen the color.  And last but not least Matte lipsticks. These are my favorite. I really like Street Cred and Aria. I have Stable and Butter & I don't really like them personally on my lips. I thought they'd be more brownish on me.  Also just for reference I wear L'oreal True Match in W3.

Honestly I like them both, but I have heard with the darker lip creams the formula isnt as great. I have Antwerp and a few others and love them, and I also love the matte lipsticks in Pure Red and Indie Flick."
drugstoreMUA,2ulnj1,spermface,2,Tue Feb 3 19:13:14 2015 UTC,So I'm seeing a couple people saying the dark forumlas aren't great. I think I'll try to avoid those for sure then.   Are there any brands you would recommend for dark colors?

drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,allrattedup,7,Tue Feb 3 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"Come to the dark side!  At CVS, you can get an ExtraCare card, which qualifies you for discounts and accruing ExtraCare Bucks.  Bucks are essentially gift cards that you earn by buying items that have attached sales (IE buy $15 of Maybelline, get $4 ECB) or from Beauty Club spending.  Beauty Club gives you $5 ECB for every $50 you spend.    I track the sales I want to use on the CVS website by logging in with my ExtraCare card. The Weekly Deals tell you about what you can get ECB on, what's BOGO, etc., and you can stack those to get bigger discounts.  They also send mailers with occasional overall coupons (IE 20% off, $4 off $20 purchase) and smaller manufacturer's coupons ($2 off Maybelline Mascara).  edit:  You have to sign up for the beauty club after you get your ExtraCare card.  WORTH IT."
drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,frumperbell,3,Tue Feb 3 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"They have an app too, which I find super helpful in store. I think it's new so it has some kinks still but it makes it much easier to track the sales."

drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,wendeelightful,14,Tue Feb 3 19:09:35 2015 UTC,"Those ExtraBucks are like crack.  And then they start sending you 25% off coupons every couple of months.  And those sales.    Things start out a little more expensive, but if you play the sales right, you save a lot.  And then you get more ExtraBucks."
drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,AlyseNovetti,6,Mon Feb 2 22:55:42 2015 UTC,EXACTLY.  I can't stop shopping there.  I'd be wasting money.
drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,AlyseNovetti,10,Tue Feb 3 00:29:54 2015 UTC,I work at a CVS and get a 20% discount. This along with the coupons make it VERY hard not to go crazy in there.

drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,madandmoonly,5,Tue Feb 3 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"Yesssss CVS has the best rewards system by far. I'm so pathetic, every few months I get their e-mails about my quarterly rewards and apparently I'm in the top 3% of savers in the nation.  I did some serious damage in there in January because I couldn't resist all the new spring collections that were launching. I was making it rain in there with Extrabucks.  I love the Maybelline mattes and the WnW lip products! I haven't tried the Burt's Bees crayons but I've heard they're awesome."

Why can't you just buy things like a normal person"" if only he knew..."
drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,theywerecones,2,Tue Feb 3 20:26:04 2015 UTC,He doesn't understand.  Everyone should bow down to this kind of couponing.

drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,ScoutFinch12,3,Mon Feb 9 19:14:20 2015 UTC,Yeah they never even bat an eyelash about it! And they always check the new coupons on the receipt to see if they're for something else I'm buying. That's awesome about the lip creams! That would be so dangerous if the one near me had them all.
drugstoreMUA,2uk2i6,GoblinTart,2,Tue Feb 10 05:40:34 2015 UTC,Right? It's incentive for me to take the 25 mile hike more often.  I can hear my wallet crying from here.

drugstoreMUA,2ultxf,madandmoonly,2,Tue Feb 3 18:40:27 2015 UTC,I'm not one for blue pinks because those look god awful with my skintone.   But a blue red that I really like is NYX Matte Lipstick in Perfect Red.

It should be obvious I take an almost odd pride in never touching my eyebrows. (There's reasons for that, it's bad enough having to wash foundation out of head scarves, I'm not going to risk brow powder on top of it)."

I absolutely love them, I will absolutely buy more in the future. I got a cool red called Bitchette (that badass name though)  and that and the matching lipliner feel great on my lips, are very opaque, and not drying. All their lipsticks and lip pencils are $5 each and free shipping after $30 so you could get a bunch and try them out for pretty damn cheap. I'm not much on pinks, I lean towards cool reds, raspberries, and neutrals but they have a bunch of nice pinks and there are tons of swatches out there by now. I'm not good at giving makeup advice to people who aren't me, so I'm not gonna try my hand at helping pick out colors because I suck at it, sorry :P"

I'm not sure why it is called a bronzer because it is definitely way too light to use as a bronzer. My skin is VERY fair and I use it as a highlighter.  I also love Hard Candy Brows Now Fiberized Brow Gel & Highlighter. I would consider this a dupe for the Benefit Gimme Brows.  Hard Candy Blush Crush Baked Blush in Bombshell is also amazing. It is a bronzey pink blush. It reminds me of MAC Warm Soul, but I actually prefer the Hard Candy blush because it has less red in it. I own Warm Soul, but I actually use the Hard Candy blush more often! I would recommend all of their baked blushes."

drugstoreMUA,2uka96,h0rn37,5,Tue Feb 3 00:46:06 2015 UTC,Yes I have and I would not recommend it. It creases really bad and every time I use it I feel like I haven't even used primer at all.

drugstoreMUA,2uka96,crazymakeuplady,3,Tue Feb 3 21:12:12 2015 UTC,I love the elf glitter primer. It's not glittery! It's meant to hold glitter in place. I use it in my makeup bag so I'm not carrying around my UDPP. It's that good.

That said, it's by no means life changing, but it definitely helps keep colours stay put, prevents creasing, and improves pigmentation.  For reference, I have tried UD Primer Potion, LORAC Behind the Scenes, NYX HD, ELF Mineral, and Rimmels primer (which is the worst thing ever)."
drugstoreMUA,2uka96,wendeelightful,2,Tue Feb 3 05:37:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I think I'll have to try it out! :)

drugstoreMUA,2uka96,sugarbees,4,Tue Feb 3 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to check out Big Lots and see if I can find any thing! Their Sheer Envy range of primers are pretty good, and I love their glossy lip stain crayons for $5."
drugstoreMUA,2uka96,sugarbees,3,Tue Feb 3 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"The eyeliner pen isn't bad, although someone on MUA said it didn't apply evenly.  For me, the pen is super black, flows pretty well, and has pretty good staying power.  The tip isn't as fine as my HG (Lorac Front of the Line) but considering the pen was $5, I can't complain.   I like some of their glosses but generally, I find a lot of their products have large chunks of glitter, which I'm not a fan of. (Or at least, that's all that's left when I go to WalMart.)"
drugstoreMUA,2uka96,theroutineriot,1 point,Mon Feb 2 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"The glitter is another reason I haven't tried much of their stuff.  I wear bold colors and shimmer 2-3 times a week, but the full on glitter chunks are too much for me.  I think that is what has kept me away from their lipstick and concealer and other glitter free products.    At the Walmarts I go to Hard Candy is the most picked over display, even more so than e.l.f.  Maybe I will go to the nice Wal-Mart in Dublin and see if it as picked over there as it is in Hayward and Union City."

I had a terrible HUGE and painful zit grow on my chin where I applied it over some discoloration. It works great, but it definitely caused my chin to grow a chin after some more experimentation and zits (and I rarely react to cosmetics). I haven't heard many other negative reviews though, and the large majority LOVE it. I would too because the coverage is bananas but acne is not a good look on me.   Just a warning to maybe patch test!"

drugstoreMUA,2ukbiz,CupcakeJunkie,3,Tue Feb 3 12:28:25 2015 UTC,I like Elf Mineral primer in the Radiant Glow finish.

drugstoreMUA,2uk9t8,gingerspanties,2,Tue Feb 3 09:33:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the differing opinions are probably due to skin type. I find it very moisturizing and it feels nice on my skin, not too heavy, I have dry skin and my skin is definitely noticeably flakier if I don't use primer. I can see why some people might think it feels greasy, but it's pretty cheap to try it!"

drugstoreMUA,2uk9t8,TotallyNotAllie,6,Tue Feb 3 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I love porefessional and hated that baby skin stuff with a passion. I've heard good things about the NYX pore filler."
drugstoreMUA,2uk9t8,Marsandtherealgirl,5,Tue Feb 3 05:30:58 2015 UTC,"I've tried Porefessional and Baby Skin, and Baby Skin seemed like a waste of money to me, it felt the same but didn't give anywhere near the same results as far as filling in pores, and it isn't tinted. L'Oreal Youth Code Texture Perfector pore vanisher is more like Porefessional. Similar formula and it's tinted. It's $20 but you get 1.4 oz, the bottle lasts FOREVER. It's usually over with the other Youth Code products in the skin care section, not by the makeup."
drugstoreMUA,2uk9t8,AlyseNovetti,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Is that anything like the L'Oreal Miracle Blur? I tried that it and it made my foundation look AWFUL!
drugstoreMUA,2uk9t8,AlyseNovetti,2,Tue Feb 3 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried Miracle Blur but based on the reviews I've read, they seem different. Texture Perfector is pretty interchangeable with Porefessional, I use them both regularly. The L'oreal one is just a little less dense, and less solid than Porefessional when you squeeze it out of the tube. It's sort of a lighter weight version, but it does the same thing as far as pore filling and the blurring effect of the tint. I would give it a try!"
drugstoreMUA,2uk9t8,steenface,3,Tue Feb 3 19:50:08 2015 UTC,NYX's Pore Filler is supposedly the closest dupe; it's even tinted (but sheers out) the way Porefessional does.  I was actually just reading something about Garnier Blur (or something like that) being a good dupe too.
drugstoreMUA,2uk9t8,jenikat,5,Mon Feb 2 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"I really didn't think I'd care for Maybelline Baby Skin, but it turned out that behaved similarly enough to Porefessional that I ended up reaching for it all the time, and even started stocking up.  The texture of both are nothing alike and they don't even smell similar.  I think the way they perform do what I want (blur pores some and create a somewhat velvety base) that I am ok with one or the other.  I think you either love it or you hate it depending on your skin type, and since it's usually pretty cheap, it might be worth trying sometime, or maybe you have a friend who can let you try it before you buy it.  I also have the NYX pore filler.  I think it is such a strange consistency (maybe I have a bad one), so I don't use it much.  I think if you were to mix some Baby Skin with NYX pore filler, it might actually end up feeling a lot like Porefessional.  In fact, I might try that today, since I've been in such a cowboy chemist mood lately xD."

drugstoreMUA,2ukpd0,Yunachoo,2,Mon Feb 2 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"Recommend: the foundation stick (a little goes a long way for me and I use a shade darker for contouring), the 3 in 1 mascara (makes my lashes look super long) and the cream shadows (I like the rose gold one and the black one for a glittery smoky eye. My only complaint is that you need a good primer or it fades kinda quickly). Edit: the blush bronzer duo has great pigmentation.   Avoid: the lipgloss balm stick (seemed patchy, color selection isn't that great and honestly I just like the Revlon ones better) and the liquid liner seemed faded on my lid.

I have two of the high-shine lipsticks in the black cases and I like them both, and I've heard good things about the matte shades in the white packaging.   As far as things to pass on, the lip butters and the jumbo eye pencils didn't impress me. There wasn't anything BAD about either of them, but there are many tinted balms and JEPs that are better. Unless there's a specific color you want, I'd skip both of those items.  edit: typo"

Avoid the high-shine lipstick (black case) and the lip/blush chubby sticks.The high-shine lipsticks have a terrible scent and go on patchy. The chubby stick broke almost immediately, and the consistency is almost grainy on the skin. It's hard to describe, but it tasted bad enough that I wouldn't wear it on my lips, either."

It's super moisturizing, and I love that it's pigmented enough to show up on my lips but sheer enough that I can slap it on on the go sans mirror.  I agree with the suggestion to use vaseline at night. It makes a world of difference.  And always make sure to stay hydrated! I've found that I can use all the lip products in the world, but if I'm dehydrated it doesn't make a difference."

drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,frumperbell,14,Sun Feb 1 21:56:04 2015 UTC,Maybelline's Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lipstick in Touch of Spice. It's an amazing color and goes on beautifully. I recommend it to anyone.
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,poopchute10,4,Mon Feb 2 01:30:29 2015 UTC,"I also really love these. I have Daringly Nude, Touch of Spice and Lust For Blush.  They don't feel drying in the least."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Erinescence,5,Mon Feb 2 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"I love the Maybelline Matte lipsticks.  And touch of spice is such an amazing color!  Being a person with chronic dry lips though, I hate loving it.  My lips can't be flaking or have any dry spot on them cause then it looks terrible."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,lalala_meh,2,Mon Feb 2 04:50:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, I have that one, Lust for Blush, and Divine Wine.  Touch of Spice is my least favorite, though I still really like it.  It's a little brown/rust for me, but it still works. I use an olive oil/brown sugar scrub and chapstick first to make it apply better."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,PinkPonySwag,6,Mon Feb 2 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"Oh boy...I've tried a lot of new stuff this month!   Physicians Formula NudeWear Touch of Glow fluid foundation: I really love this stuff! Nice buildable light-to-medium coverage with a natural satin-y finish that looks radiant but not shiny or dewy. The brush included is pretty small, I use a large stippling brush or a beauty blender knockoff to apply. Physicians Formula Extreme Shimmer Gel Cream shadows/liners: I'm a fan of these too! I wear them as shadows, I don't think they'd work as a liner. They go on sheer but can be layered to be more opaque. I like to use them over top of a shadow to give more sparkle. I use a flat shader brush for the most even application. Jordana Modern Matte lipstick in Blush: This was ok, for the price point I'd pick the Wet N Wild megalasts over these unless there is a specific color you really want. I'd consider the finish to be more semi-matte. It's creamy and non-drying, but it felt very heavy and thick on my lips which is why I didn't love it.  L'Oreal Brow Stylist Plumper: This is my new HG brow product! I prefer this to the Hard Candy fiber brow gel. I have the dark brown shade and it gives a decent amount of color and hold and gives a nice, full, textured look that I love. I fill in a few sparse areas with a brow pencil then brush this through and I'm done. Love it! L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Spray&Set setting spray: Another new HG! I've tried the UD De-slick and All-Nighter, ELF, and Nyx Matte and Dewy and this wins by far. I love the fresh look a setting spray gives, but none of the previous sprays besides the All-Nighter actually noticeably extended the wear of my makeup. My face can go all day long with this stuff. I was sold when I worked all day, took a nap, and woke up with perfect make-up. It doesn't control oil/shine though, so sometimes on my nose my foundation will still break down a bit but this does lessen the effect significantly. NYC BB Radiance Powder: I got this in the lightest shade and it was a bit orange-y on my NW-15 skin so it's a no-go for me because of that. Barring the color matching problem , the powder itself was very smooth and almost creamy feeling. I'd say the texture is a step up from their translucent Smooth Skin pressed powder. I didn't notice any added radiance, though. If you happen to match nicely to one of the 3 color options I could see this being a nice powder. Wet N Wild Silk Finish lipsticks: So WNW reformulated these and I gotta say that for 99 cents these are hard to beat! I have the shades What's Up Doc and Hot Paris Pink, and they are gorgeous bright cream finishes. These are pretty slippery and can move around on the lips quite a bit so I'd recommend a lip liner. Since they are creams they aren't the most long-lasting, but the bright shades at least leave a good stain behind so you can get away with only re-applying after eating.    Edit: formatting!"
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,wendeelightful,2,Sun Feb 1 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"I've been eyeing that new setting spray, but I can't justify picking it up. It's so expensive for a drugstore item and I just bought a new bottle of NYX's spray."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,wendeelightful,3,Mon Feb 2 03:07:14 2015 UTC,"It is definitely expensive for a drug store item! I personally like CVS's rewards system the best, you can get some awesome deals if you time it right because they will let you stack coupons infinitely. Pay attention to the sales over there and you should be able to accumulate some extrabucks when you're restocking on items and add a manufacturer's coupon and a CVS storewide 20% coupon and bam!"

drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Erinescence,1 point,Mon Feb 2 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"Silk finish! That's the name I keep forgetting. I've been picking them up, and really like the ones that I've tried."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Cameo-Illustrated,5,Tue Feb 3 05:46:21 2015 UTC,"Rimmel Provocalips 16HR Kiss-Proof Lip Color: Really enjoy these, though the colors on the tubes are not always good representations of the actual lip colors.  As long as you let the color layer dry completely before applying the balm, and re-apply the balm if your lips begin to feel dry or sticky, these wear like iron and look beautiful. I have the shades Make Your Move, I'll Call You, and Play With Fire. Big HIT!  Rimmel Lasting Finish 25 HR Liquid Foundation: As a fan of the original formula, I was excited to try this.  The formula is very thick and I far prefer the squeeze-tube packaging to the new glass, pumpless bottle though the bottle looks classier. The finish and wear are similar to that of the original, but I can't find a color match.  (If you aren't familiar with Rimmel foundations, the shades are not the same from one formula to the next, regardless of name or number.) Would be a HIT if I could find my shade.   Rimmel Lasting Finish Kate Moss Urban Bohemian Lipstick Collection: No surprise, LOVE these. If you are a fan of the Lasting Finish Lipsticks or of their Kate Moss collections, you will also love these. I have shades 30 and 31. HIT.  Rimmel Show-Off Lip Matte Lip Velvet: Picked up three shades of these and really only like the dark one.  The two lighter shades, Atomic Rose and Apollo, can look a little chalky, by I am in absolute love with Meteoric Matte.  I'd recommend the darker shades of these and say skip the pale ones.   Maybelline Fit Me Matte and Poreless: Just picked this up and have only worn it once, but so far I like it.  This is a very thin, runny formula that blends very easily and dries almost immediately. Makes me think of a liquid-to-powder product, actually.  Gives good light-to-medium coverage and can be layered. Very natural appearance on the skin. It's a natural matte. Can't say I notice anything different or magical about my pores. I wouldn't call it an ""oil-control"" foundation, as I did have to blot my nose around the 4 hour mark (worn without powder),  but 4 hours isn't bad as I have to blot my t-zone within 3 hours with many foundations.  I still have to try different primers under it, try it with powder, etc., but I am really pleased with it so far! HIT  Maybelline The Rocket Mascara: I realize it's been around a long time, but I just finally tried it. Really, really like it! It's like 3 coats of CoverGirl Clump Crusher in a single application. BIG HIT!"
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,wendeelightful,3,Mon Feb 2 11:43:26 2015 UTC,"Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless. Got this at the end of December. I love the finish and texture but the high alcohol content dries out my dry skin even further. But it looks fabulous and it's an inexpensive foundation that doesn't have sun screen (picture friendly!). I also love that I don't have to set in. The coverage is great but I can still see my skin peeking through. It is also very light weight.  DRY SKIN GIRLS. I figured out a way to make this foundation work for me. I moisturize and prime my face before application. I also mix some of my primer with the foundation just before I put it on my face. I will apply with my fingers and spread it around (clean hands of course) and then blend with my Beauty Blender. This way it doesn't emphasize my dryness or get caught in my patches. If I feel I need to, I will spritz my face with a refreshing toner."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Cameo-Illustrated,3,Sun Feb 1 23:52:27 2015 UTC,I love the tip about mixing primer with foundation! My cheeks get dry sometimes so I'll have to try that.
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,dog_butts,1 point,Mon Feb 2 00:20:16 2015 UTC,Definitely try it. It's a game changer. I don't even know if it has been mentioned anywhere before. I had a light bulb moment one day and it totally worked for me!
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Erinescence,2,Mon Feb 2 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"I tried Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless but my skin is very, very oily. So I'll share my experience because it was a bit different.  I tried this first by applying with my fingers, since that's my preferred method of applying foundation. I found the coverage was pretty opaque but it settled into my pores pretty much immediately. I was NOT impressed. Second time I tried it I applied it in very thin layers using a paddle foundation brush. This made the application much more even, though it was still really cakey around my nose. Better, but not great.  So over the weekend I was playing around with this stuff again and mixed it with some moisturizer (Cetaphil Oil Control with SPF). This made it much more like a BB cream in terms of texture and coverage. It was more sheer but it applied SO MUCH BETTER! It definitely looks much less cakey and a lot more natural. I don't think I would re-purchase this but at least now I know how best to apply it, its not so bad."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,dog_butts,2,Mon Feb 2 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"The first two times you tried it, what were you wearing under it? Bare skin? Moisturizer? Primer?"
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Cameo-Illustrated,1 point,Mon Feb 2 15:51:34 2015 UTC,Just moisturizer. I considered picking up the new primer Maybelline has but didn't and now I'm wondering if it would help or not.
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,dog_butts,2,Mon Feb 2 16:07:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the foundation it's very finicky. Definitely not fool proof. But I really like how light it feels and I love that I don't need to set it.
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,MermaidMermaid,1 point,Mon Feb 2 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it definitely takes a little trial and error to get it right, but when you get it right it is pretty good!"
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,PinkPonySwag,4,Mon Feb 2 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"Revlon Illuminance Creme Shadow, 4 Shades, Not Just Nudes - MISS This is the first creme shadow I've purchased. I like the colors, but they didn't stay very well. The creme ends up being too oily for me and dissipates pretty rapidly.  Maybelline Lasting Drama by Eye Studio Gel Eyeliner, Charcoal - HIT Bought this as an impulse buy. The brush is great - stiff, synthetic bristles - because I've never used a gel liner before, and the learning curve with this one was super minimal. I love that I can pack the color right up to my lashes. Stays all day. I'd buy it again."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Miss_Anthropie,3,Mon Feb 2 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"I kind of went insane with CVS/Ulta coupons this January and bought a ton of new stuff. I feel like I robbed the place.  NYX Matte Lipstick in Whipped Caviar This is pretty much the perfect mauve nude for me.  It's gorgeous, has great color payoff, and goes on really smoothly for a matte.  It lasted through a ton of SuperBowl snacking last night, too, which was really impressive.  Loreal Infallible Eyeshadow in Amber Rush Holy shit it's amazing.  It's a stunning bronzey/rose gold color that can be used as a one-shadow look.  It takes a little work to build it to full-opacity dry, but I may or may not have accidentally spent 24 hours in it as a result of alcohol (over UDPP, to be fair), and it still looked good, with only minor creasing.  Maybelline Matte in Divine Wine  Love.  This color is my soulmate red.  It's rich and beautiful and matte and perfect.  It needs well-cared-for lips and liner, though.  Burt's Bees Lip Crayon in Napa Valley Just bought, and also in love.  It's red, but just a hair off in a rich, berry kind of way. I may not be fully faithful to any one dark lip, no matter how soulmate-y they may be."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Erinescence,3,Mon Feb 2 16:45:58 2015 UTC,"Milani Baked Runway Eyeshadows: I saw Milani's Runway Eyeshadows on sale and snapped them up immediately (because Milani, right? They're awesome, right?), only to regret the decision. :( They look deceivingly pigmented in the pan and are horribly chalky. The color payoff is disappointing. They need lots of primer and packing and even then there's still something off about how vibrant they should look in proportion to how much needs to be applied. Maybelline Dream Lumi Highlighting Concealer: I may or may not know what they're actually called because I found out only after purchasing that I had confused them with the L'Oreal highlighter, which is named almost identically. Still, it works fine. I chose a shade close to my skin color (so not much lighter) and it has a subtle illuminating effect. Good enough for day-to-day wear and lifting dark sports, but I'd recommend something with a bit more oomph if you plan on wearing it in contrast with full contour for an extra-glamorous look. Texture is nice, doesn't cake over my additional layer of concealer. LA Colors Jumbo Eye Pencils: whut whuuuuut. Found out my local dollar store stocked a TON of LA Colors products. The JEPs are MUCH creamier than NYX's but otherwise I think they're quite comparable, though I can't be too sure, seeing as I've only used 1 NYX JEP before. Very nice colors, excellent price."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Miss_Anthropie,3,Sun Feb 1 22:19:26 2015 UTC,Are the Milani Baked shadows any better if you apply them wet?
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,Erinescence,2,Mon Feb 2 11:50:23 2015 UTC,"Enh...yes, but not by a whole lot. I've only done it once and probably won't do it again because my eyeshadow brushes end up being damp and stained and seeing as I have only a few in my arsenal, it makes application inconvenient. I might give it a try again if you'd like more detailed evidence!"

Plus it looked like it'd be awkward to use.  I'm pretty sure they've all been d/ced now that the new Bella Eyes are out.  And you're right about the LA Colors JEPs.  I picked one up because, fuck it, it was only a dollar.  It was such a nice, creamy, pigmented shadow pencil.  Of course I lost it :("

drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,sugarbees,3,Wed Feb 4 06:21:38 2015 UTC,"I picked up a bunch of Wet n Wild Megalast matte lipsticks (Spiked with Rum, Sandstorm, Cinnamon Spice, Sugar Plum Fairy, Purty Persimmon, 24 Carrot Gold) and loved all of them. I'm an NC45 and was looking for a natural every day lip color and some of them were really close, especially when paired with a brown lipliner. The 24 Carrot Gold is hilariously bright and awful on the lips but can be repurposed as a nice under eye corrector or a cream blush.   Lip liner I bought Jordana Coco Loco, Jordana Plush Plum, Jordana Rock n Rose, and some Essence Red one. All worked out great.   Gloss I bought Maybelline Color Elixir in Mandarin Rapture and Vision in Violet. The Mandarin Rapture is surprisingly sheer but can be used to add a bright coral tone to red lipsticks. The Vision in Violet is incredibly bright purple, looks great with basically any lip color to bring in some purple.  I got Loreal infallible gel liner and like it a lot. Also got L'Oréal Telescopic waterproof mascara and liked it. It's very lengthening."
drugstoreMUA,2ug68i,TotallyNotAllie,3,Mon Feb 2 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"shifty eyes   I feel like I need to go on a proper no-buy soon after this month, but I'm weak oops. The new spring products are just coming into the CVS near my house so that's not helping me.   Milani Matte Lipstick in Matte Naked  This is fine. I like the feel of the lipstick and the color, but it's a bit more on the drying side once applied.   Milani Lip Pencil in Spice  I like this pencil a lot. It's a natural lip liner, but with a slight red/brown undertone on my skin. Very pigmented and smooth application.   Jordana lip liners in Tawny and Baby Berry.   I'm not a fan of the packaging. I feel like I have to yank the top off every time I try to use them. But other than that issue, they're pigmented and smooth which is what I look for in lip liners.   NYX Dewy Finish spray.   I've used this a few times so far and I like it! My dry skin tends to make foundation look a bit too matte for my liking when first applied, so I use some sprays of this. Since I apply it from a considerable distance from my face, it just gives me a touch of extra moisture rather than making me look sweaty.   L'oreal Million Lashes Voluminous (?) mascara.   A bit wet for my liking, but I figure it'll dry out in a bit. Other than that, it does make my lashes look more dramatic and it really lasts throughout the day considering I need to really rub with oil to get it off at night when I get home.   Jordana Fabuliner   Love! I don't know how long it'll last, but I'll be glad to buy another for less than 3 bucks. I bought this for wing practice and it's really helping! Plus, the formula is very black and I really have to rub my area with oil to get it completely off at night. Even my UD Perversion Pencil eyeliner comes off with more ease.   Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream.   I'm kind of a Cerave fangirl. It took will power not to buy the new serum too lol but I'm always on the hunt for moisturizers. I'd say this cream is as moisturizing as the one in the tub, but it has a much lighter feel and it doesn't leave a weird film that I sometimes feel when I use Cerave in the tub.  Essie Luxe Effects in Set in Stones   Love this glitter top coat! It's so cute and chic. I've worn it two weeks in a row over different colors. It pairs beautifully over cool and/or neutral colors. I've had compliments on it from strangers lol."

But, you know,  a dollar and they have a healthy color range.   I like some of the lip stuff I've gotten but again if you like heavy pigmented go for the silk finish stuff from Wet and Wild.

drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,frumperbell,4,Sun Feb 1 20:34:28 2015 UTC,I feel the same way.  It's why I skipped the Colorpop train.
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,Haibarai,3,Sun Feb 1 21:51:07 2015 UTC,"Ignore me while I rave like a youtuber, but I was actually really surprised by Colourpop. The lip products are average to me, good but nothing that makes it amazing especially since it only contains 1/3 of product in comparison to your average lipstick which makes it about the same price as MAC.  But their eyeshadows. Oh, the eyeshadows are awesome. Super pigmented, easy to apply and they last ages on the lids which is quite a feat for me and they contain 2.1grams of product which is more than most eyeshadow pans."
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,frumperbell,2,Tue Feb 3 00:32:34 2015 UTC,It just seems very sketch to me that practically overnight it was like COLORPOP EXPLOSION!!!!!! all over Youtube.    But it's nice to hear from a non-yt shill that they're not totally shady and do put out good products.
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,sugarbees,2,Tue Feb 3 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"MUACJDiscussion did some digging and the Colourpop company is owned by some shell company that basically just wants to do overnight branding, which is why it exploded overnight. They don't care about quality first, that's just a bonus if it works out."
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,jessirose713,5,Wed Feb 4 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"I'm late to this discussion, but I own the sable set. The only brush I didn't love was the duo brush. The longer bristles are too long and I tend to make a mess of whatever I'm using it with. The pointed liner brush isn't the easiest to use either, but I'm not confident that it just isn't my lack of skill. :)  However the angled liner brush and the blending brushes are awesome. They are really fluffy and dense and they don't feel coarse like some lower end brushes. I bought a sigma foundation brush, it shed bristles constantly and fell apart after a month. I've never had that problem with the Morphe brushes."
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,makeupdr89,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:52:01 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thank you for your help!"
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,Cameo-Illustrated,2,Tue Feb 3 17:51:54 2015 UTC,I ordered from Morphe and their customer service is terrible. It's been more than a week and they charged my card yet not a PEEP about my order being shipped. UGH...
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,ninja002,2,Tue Feb 24 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"So I have recently ordered a bunch of Morphe brushes and eyeshadow singles. I can recommend everything that I got. However, I only ordered from the Gunmetal line. I personally don't know if I should order their other brushes, as I do not trust the quality of them. I have read horror stories online of people receiving broken or low quality brushes. I also do not believe YouTube gurus' comparisons of the brushes. For example, many gurus compare their brushes to MAC brushes and I simply don't believe them.  As for shadows, their shimmer shadows are amazing. They're creamy and pigmented. Your 2 dollars won't go to waste. Their matte shadows are drier but nicely pigmented and easily blendable. They are way above drugstore quality in my opinion. I would get more shadows in the future as I only purchased 6.  Their Gunmetal brushes are phenomenal. I want to compare the bristle quality to Real Techniques. Except you don't have to buy a set with 1-2 brushes you know you will never use. You get excellent brushes at an excellent price. I actually find myself reaching for my Morphe brushes more than my Sigma brushes! I have got a lot of their eye brushes and their flat foundation brush. I am very pleased with the quality."
drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,obsoletepastries,2,Sun Feb 1 23:46:45 2015 UTC,The gun metal brushes look soooo nice. Really luxe. I think it might be worth it to spend a little bit more and get some higher quality brushes. Thank you for your recommendations!

drugstoreMUA,2ufu5f,obsoletepastries,2,Sun Feb 1 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"They just seem kinda scratchy and they don't pick up product as well as I would like. Maybe they're designed to be that way, but I'm not keen on it."

drugstoreMUA,2u9cll,Cameo-Illustrated,3,Sun Feb 1 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"I would bring a bottle of your matching foundation with you to the drugstore. Just eyeball it. Compare the shades in the bottles side by side and hold it next to your skin. If you are split between different shades, don't be afraid to buy more than one. You can always return the shade that doesn't work for you. Just make sure the store has a flexible return policy. Stores with great return policies (in my experience) include Ulta,  Target, CVS, and Duane Reade. I have had a strangely bad experience with Walgreens. Keep receipts with you just incase!  Another tip would be to look up similar shades online. Websites like findation.com ask for your perfect shades and tell you what other foundations could be a close match."

drugstoreMUA,2u8ern,mommafatpimp,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"I've tried a L'oreal one from way back and don't remember the name. It may have been an older version of the Lineur Intense. Also tried the Revlon Colorstay liquid eyeliner which stayed put pretty well, but wasn't huge on the applicator. Also tried the elf one and didn't like the staying power."
drugstoreMUA,2u8ern,AlyseNovetti,2,Sat Jan 31 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"Is it something happens throughout the day or right after you put it on? You might just need to wait for it to dry more. If not, try L'Oreal Telescopic Waterproof Liner, that stuff does not budge! Once it's dry it just becomes like a sealed layer until you take it off, and even then it comes off as basically one solid strip. You could also try setting your liner with a powder eyeshadow."
drugstoreMUA,2u8ern,AlyseNovetti,1 point,Fri Jan 30 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"I love this liner. Been wearing it for years. It's kind of shiny so I dab some black shadow over it with an angled brush. I have literally gone swimming wearing this eyeliner and it didn't budge. I go to bed wearing it. Sometimes it's still there in the morning, sometimes not. I just rub my eyes to get it off. Easiest eyeliner ever and the wand sponge thing is really convenient for cat eye."

I tried NYX, ELF, for drugstore and lorac and urban decay. None worked for me. I finally decided to splurge on NARS and it works really well. It's $25 but I've had the tube for almost a year and there is still plenty left (and I use it nearly daily).   But I know tons of people where drugstore options work really well for them so I would always suggest starting out with drugstore options to see if those work."
drugstoreMUA,2u6bqw,lakehylia,13,Fri Jan 30 07:02:41 2015 UTC,"NYX full coverage concealer! I use the pastel yellow and just use a very light layer. Stays all day and brightens nicely (plus, it's only 5 dollars!!)"

drugstoreMUA,2u6bqw,bratchny,9,Fri Jan 30 14:07:16 2015 UTC,"You will probably find creasing in any concealer you use. YMMV. I suggest finding a formula you really like. One that works with your skin. To prevent creasing there are numerous steps you can take.  First, prime your under eyes. I like to use NYX's HD eye primer. Just pat it in wherever you are going to conceal. Don't forget to let the product sink in for a few minutes.  Second, set the primer with a light dusting of powder.  Third, conceal. Start with a little. Then layer it if you find that you need more coverage. If you have REALLY DARK circles, use a salmon toned concealer (NYX and Pixi comes to mind) to neutralize the darkness. Between layers, don't forget to let the product sink into your skin. It has to set on it's own. Always remember that a little goes a long way.   Fourth, once again, set with powder. Just a light dusting.  Fifth, incase you find that you are still creasing in your tear duct or any fine lines, take a q-tip and wipe it off. You won't have to do it again. It's normal that some excess product gets caught in your fine lines. Don't sweat it. Your make up shouldn't budge for the rest of the day.  Tip: to avoid cakiness under your eyes, avoid applying foundation there. Concealer will give you all the coverage you need. Foundation would just be an unnecessary layer that will increase your chances of cakiness or creasing.   Again, YMMV. Feel free to omit any steps. This is what works for me and it helps prevent creasing/makes my makeup budgeproof."

drugstoreMUA,2u6bqw,Babysitter2ndClass,4,Fri Jan 30 07:32:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure what your skin tone is, but I use Pixi's Brightening Peach corrector as my main undereye concealer. I have pretty dark hereditary circles and I just use that and set it with powder.  Edit: Before I conceal I use the RoC Retinol Correction eye cream. The retinol helps with the darkness and is a good base for the concealer."
drugstoreMUA,2u6bqw,wittyusernametaken,3,Tue Feb 3 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"A color corrector under your concealer might help, as well. Depending upon your skintone, usually something in the orange to yellow range. I believe Maybelline makes a yellow color corrector stick that looks like a lipstick. Also, set your concealer with powder to help the coverage stay longer."

drugstoreMUA,2u6bqw,ShaunaOfTheDead,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"Lol been there. I color correct with yellow on my purple spots and green on the red, conceal (with one shade too light for my skin) in a triangle with the tip towards my cheek bone covering more than just the circle (and putting concealer on the darkest parts) and let set for 30 seconds before  blending. If my under eyes were a normal beast maybe this would work but no! I have actual shadows as dark circles on my face so I take the wrong end of a brush and dot some white into the shadow. I then go over with concealer again since I don't use foundation.   But anyway the point is look at what the circles are from mine are thin skin (discoloration) and puffiness (shadow)  some people can handle the puffiness from lack of sleep with eye serums or tea bags but mines genetic so that contouring is life. If yours is discoloration get a color correcting concealer, life changing magic."
drugstoreMUA,2u6bqw,fuckuandyoureyebrows,3,Thu Feb 5 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Like you, I've used the Fit Me concealer as well and I was a bit mixed on it. When I started using an orange colour correcter (small dabs of NYX) and particularly moisturising under my eyes, it made a big difference and I love it now.  What works for me is moisturising under eyes, face primer under the eyes, orange corrector only on the darkest parts, and then concealer.   Some people use concealer brushes but I just use my fingers to tap a little in at a time so I don't overdo it. I tend to use a lot and using less makes a big difference product in getting into the creases.   Like someone else said, don't apply foundation under the eyes. The order I apply make up in is eyes, concealer, then face. It makes it easer to blend out the concealer and make it look more natural, especially if you're like me and dark circles extend waaay down into my face lol.   Pressed powder can be heavy, cake up on you, and even change the color of the concealer to make under the eye look darker depending on the shade. This is what I noticed on myself since I've tried that too. Have you tried setting with a translucent powder instead? I'm afraid I haven't tried any drugstore versions but its much lighter and finer powder. It'll set under your eyes much better I think.   Hope this helps :)"

drugstoreMUA,2u5fzq,quin_violet,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:51:08 2015 UTC,I would recommend Garnier bb creams. There are 2 formulas: regular and one for oily skin. The colour choices are not great but if you find it a match then it would be build-able. I find it's thick and only use a tiny bit since I prefer sheer coverage.They're fairly affordable for a huge tube that goes a long way. I've been using mine for about 6 months and I use it almost every day.   I've tried ELF bb cream as well which is under $5 and is a bit more sheer and mosituring than Garnier but in a much smaller tube.

drugstoreMUA,2u4a9d,poopchute10,12,Thu Jan 29 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as much as this might seem like a cop-out response, I think the easiest way to show someone how to contour would be to link them to various videos on YouTube.   I think it's great to start with watching videos [which I'd be happy to recommend, as I'm sure many others will as well] for a general sense and technique, but once you've gotten comfortable with the technique, my advice is to Google images of the zygomatic bone. Look at its placement, then feel your own face. Sucking in your cheeks and placing the contour there isn't always the ideal way to go about it; by locating your zygomatic, you can adjust the technique to fit your own face.   Regarding products, I think the 'easiest' way to contour would be with powder. My most recent purchase for contouring is NYX Matte Bronzer in deep tan [I'm approx. an NC30 skin tone]. Another option for something considerably less intense is NYC Sunny. It's very affordable and I think it's a great option for a beginner."

drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,MissRepresentation,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"I think a very soft lavender would be nice. A soft, pretty color but not too distracting."
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,goldenjuicebox,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:45:02 2015 UTC,I'm voting teal/turquoise!
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,goldenjuicebox,9,Fri Jan 30 14:14:34 2015 UTC,I also think that adding findation.com somewhere on the sidebar or in a master post of some kind would be really helpful.
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,classylady87,5,Thu Jan 29 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe a blue color scheme? Not much reasoning for this - blue is just a nice color. It's the opposite of pink but still goes nicely with pink, so there's that.   I think air for posts would be fantastic! Product review, product request, swatches, dupe, dupe request, FOTD, and list of favorites is all I can think of for flairs, but that's what's usually posted in the makeup subs.   Honestly, I love how fast this sub grew. My nearest makeup stores besides Kohls are 45 minutes away, and my wallet is always afraid of going with!"
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,crayolasand,2,Thu Jan 29 12:19:16 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with blue is that it's the default color for reddit. So unless we went much darker, it wouldn't look customized at all. I do like your flair suggestions! I will probably add those to the list.  I am still shocked at how fast this grew! I honestly had very, very small expectations for it and then I was blown away.   Do you not have a Walmart, Target, Rite Aid, etc. near you?"
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,wolfjay_,2,Thu Jan 29 12:27:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's why I thought blue would look nice! I've been living on mobile, so everything's white.   I do have a Walmart, but there's nail polish everywhere and it's poorly lit. I'm relying on Walgreens to pick up the slack. I have two of those, so drugstore products should be much easier for me to grab."
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,wolfjay_,3,Thu Jan 29 12:29:37 2015 UTC,Ugh my Walmart is always cleared out/destroyed. I hate it! I hear that this is pretty common though and it sucks because they have a great selection :(
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,wolfjay_,2,Thu Jan 29 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"When it's actually stocked, you mean!"
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,wolfjay_,4,Thu Jan 29 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"Since I'm really into this sub and plan on being an active contributor, I will try to answer all the questions!  Sidebar:   I think a master list of ""your favorite ___"" would be great. There are several threads going on already with the same premise, and having a list on the sidebar would really help keep those same threads from popping up frequently. Most definitely agree, as I think this ties in well with Q1. While the idea sounds great, I'm not sure how useful it would be in practice; for example, I've heard of Target carrying NYX and I have yet to see it in either of my local Targets. The idea is great, but I'm not positive that it would ultimately be worth the effort, since [from my perspective] it changes so drastically from city to city, store to store.  As far as other sidebar material - I feel more will reveal itself as time goes on and we keep posting, but for now: what about a list of blogs/channels that cater exclusively to drugstore brand products?    Also for the sidebar, perhaps a list of dupes?  Suggestions:   What about a khaki or camel color?  As far as flairs go, I feel like that's fairly basic/will depend on our overall community needs. What is already listed seems like a good start, and as we grow, our flairs can, too. Off the top of my head, for the sake of suggestions - perhaps a FOTD tag, and in addition to 'request': dupe request, or even a general dupe flair? Or how about a 'coupon' flair, when people find a printable coupon/coupon code to share? I'm blanking at this, but perhaps more will come to mind and I'll add later. I think highlighting a specific brand for a weekly thread would be useful, allowing for discussion of hits and misses and all that jazz. Also perhaps a thread where we showcase [either on our faces or via swatches] our favorite [insert product type here, e.g blushes]? I agree with your sentiments shared. Much like how I feel about flair, I believe any need for specific rules will show themselves with time. As of now, I very much like how it's a generally self-moderated sub with a mod to step in when necessary. I think once flair is established, having a rule to flair posts would be good, but I'd also hate to see great posts deleted merely because they forgot to flair. Is there a way to edit post titles to include a flair, so that a mod can give the OP warning instead of just deleting the thread? Nothing off the top of my head at the moment!   Edit: formatting crap"
drugstoreMUA,2u2fvj,mscarsonelle,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"Sidebar:   I think that this is essentially a HG type of thing. I don't think it would really be necessary to have both a HG sidebar post and a favorites list. Maybe we'll have a monthly thread for favorites or something along those lines because people tend to go through ""phases"" where they love different products (or is that just me?). The reason I suggested lip colors is because there's a similar post on MUA, although I don't know if they added it to the sidebar or not. Thanks for the input :) My thought process was to have a general overview of what stores carry which brand, and to include international stores, but I have to agree that the idea is pretty shakey in all honesty.  I completely agree that it will reveal itself over time! I know there was a thread to blogs/channels yesterday or the day before so I'll take a look at how that went. The problem with a dupes list is that there are endless amounts of these. If we could figure out how to narrow it down, or post a weekly/bi-weekly/monthly thread, then we can do it!   Suggestions:   I'll see if that's possible with the basic color editing reddit has. I was just using some examples of requests, but dupe is also one I was thinking of. A coupon/sale flair is a good idea! Good ideas! I'll keep these in mind. Thank you! I'm not sure if you can add flair after it's been posted, but I can add a reminder page right before you post something."

When you look at your face all of the natural shadows are grey toned so that's what you want to mimic. For an actual bronzer, the body shop honey bronzers come in good light colors for fair skin!

I get some redness around my chin and nose so I apply The Face Shop Green Primer (only $5) very lightly before applying foundation. Basically I dab a TINY bit on my red areas and blend/tap it out with my finger. It leaves those areas looking almost white (so meaning very little to no redness visible). Then I do my foundation as normal (may want to try a heavier coverage with rosacea) and then on the actual blemishes (acne spots mostly that still peak through) I dab a tiny bit of green concealer, blend and then top with a regular concealer to match the tone to the rest of my face.

drugstoreMUA,2ty4i4,ProjectCherry,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:48:51 2015 UTC,I was kind of iffy about the Touch of Spice because it's a matte formula and I thought that matte would be too drying for me. But the formula is nice and silky. It does highlight any flakiness though so I have to be sure my lips are in good shape before applying it. But it doesn't cause additional dryness.
drugstoreMUA,2ty4i4,LaFeltinelli,5,Mon Feb 2 00:59:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe Revlon's Rum Raisin as a lipstick? It depends on your skin tone, but it sure shows up Marsala-ish on me (I'm Indian, NW25). Maybe you could look up some reviews and swatches for your skin tone and see how it is."

drugstoreMUA,2ty4i4,iwishiwastall,1 point,Thu Jan 29 05:06:51 2015 UTC,I've actually had no problems. What I do is apply a lip balm first. Not like a heavy layer or anything but I make sure my lips are moistened. Then I apply an even layer of the Megalast and I use my fingers to dab it in to make sure I don't have too much product on them.  Then you just have to let it dry before touching your lips together.  I wore it to a long party last weekend that included alcoholic beverages and eating and I was seriously impressed with the longevity of it for the low price. (It even withstood nasty rainy weather and kissing)

drugstoreMUA,2ty4i4,BeeLovely,1 point,Thu Jan 29 05:26:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I've watched a couple of YouTube reviews and it seemed like they were expecting it to stay glossy or not dry and they would touch their lips together before it set.

drugstoreMUA,2u0kaj,mugsywebb,3,Wed Jan 28 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell (and someone correct me if I'm wrong)you look cool toned. Just a tiny bit of redness on your face. Which you may or may not care about.   For foundation, which can be a pain in the ass to get the right color , I'd go to sephora and get matched with a few different brands and get  some samples. Wear them to see how they look.  Then use Findation.com to see the drugstore options available! A lot of drugstores  (Walgreens, CVS, etc ) will accept open returns.   I'm fair skinned as all and for cheekbone contouring I like NYX taupe blush. We hear about it a lot but it's cheap and look really natural.  Bronzers, if you want a more bronzer type contour around your face, I  haven't found anything natural looking drugstore wise yet. Most are too orange on me. I stick with NARS Laguna (the liquid/cream one) since I can really sheer it down or build it up. So I'm open to dupes on that as well."

It was hard to see in the store, but as soon as I went outside in natural light I could tell my face looked darker than my chest, just a little. You look about my shade, and I'm usually one to two shades up from the lightest foundation colors so keep your receipts, try out a few different products (buy two shades next to each other in the same brand for example) and see which one matches your NECK/CHEST, not necessarily your face."

Two baby blues and an opaque white from Wet'n'wild, the names of the colours have rubbed off so I have no idea.

It was AMAZING.  As for the lippie, I found it worked best with a clear lip liner around the edge and then I have this eyeshadow palette from Claires (can you tell I work there? I have all their makeup.) with a lovely matte red colour, very wine like, almost claret. I put that on over the lippie with a brush and then hairspray sealed it in to give it an extra vampy glam look."

I think NYX is also a pretty good drug store brand for most of their products as well. I like their colored butter lip balm. It's really smooth like Chapstick but also adds a pop of color to your lips! I also have the Maybelline Nudes Palette and the Maybelline Brights Palette that I really like!

It's great for loose eyeshadow powders, shimmer, glitter, duochromes, etc. If you are wearing a loose shadow that has shimmer or a duochrome, a lot of times it can look washed out without a glitter glue or primer. I know Two Faced makes a glitter glue that is similar but the elf one works fine for $2 vs $20."

drugstoreMUA,2twslt,So_Schilly,1 point,Thu Jan 29 01:30:05 2015 UTC,No not really. It's pretty liquidy when it goes on and becomes tacky as it's drying. Once it becomes tacky it allows shadow to stick to it. Then when it's fully dry I don't even feel it. Even when it's tacky though it doesn't really pull on the skin.

drugstoreMUA,2tw6gn,a_mazz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:33:38 2015 UTC,"Apply lipstick in thin layers, blotting in between. The blotting is important! You need to build up the color so it's not too goopy. After blotting a final time, once your lipstick is dry to the touch, use a thin layer of lipcote over the entire area, including just outside your lip line. Keep your lips apart while it dries. Which is awkward, since it takes a minute. I kept mine apart until the tingling stopped and I could touch my lips without transfer."

drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,angryspring,11,Tue Jan 27 19:55:09 2015 UTC,I use the Real Techniques version and like it quite a bit.  I generally use it for concealing and for BB/CC cream.  I'm still hooked on using my UD Optical Blurring Brush for Tarte foundation.
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,rycheme,7,Tue Jan 27 20:07:32 2015 UTC,Seconding the Real Techniques one. It's probably the best sponge besides the Beauty Blender
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,imsofluffy,5,Tue Jan 27 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"I've tried the Sonia Kashuk, the CVS store brand, the Target up & up one, and the Real Techniques, and RT is by far my favorite. The Target isn't terrible, but I didn't like the CVS one, and I liked the Sonia Kashuk one but it fell apart on me pretty quickly with just regular cleaning so I didn't rebuy."
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,sabinky,5,Tue Jan 27 21:14:59 2015 UTC,"The Bella beauty blender, $4 from TJMaxx/Marshalls. It is better than the RT one in my opinion... seems a little softer and nicer."
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,sugarbees,2,Tue Jan 27 23:09:34 2015 UTC,I use the Revive beauty blender which apparently is made by the same company as the Bella beauty blender. Definitely recommended if you don't want to splurge on the Beauty Blender!
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,jadeycakes,2,Tue Jan 27 23:44:09 2015 UTC,I like the RT Miracle Complexion Sponge. I find it is even better than the BB. It has a wedge shaped side which is great for applying concealer and foundation around the nose and eyes.
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,CinnamonBunBun,2,Tue Jan 27 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"I have one of the knockoffs from Bella (or maybe it's the Revive? Either way, it was 3.99 at TJ). I'm not big on beauty sponges at all and only use it for a) BB cream, and b) putting makeup on my nose, but it seems to work really well for putting on just enough, especially on troubled areas. I would never pay twenty dollars for a similar product.   It does seem to soak up more product, and since I use a prestige foundation I'm not about to try putting it on with a sponge. I prefer my Real Techniques Face Perfecting Brush for that. It has its place, though!"
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,SoftMetalFoxes,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:39:20 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to try sponges, I think the CVS Essence of Beauty wedges are awesome. These sponges have very fine grain and are super soft. They aren't in the shape of the beauty blender so you lose some of the finer points of the application process but it's definitely worth trying."
drugstoreMUA,2tvjh2,_mischief,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:41:59 2015 UTC,I have the real technique one and love it for my foundation! I think it was $5 at Walmart. It's the fist thing I've used to apply foundation that doesn't make my dry skin look cakey.
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,LaMaklovia,4,Wed Jan 28 01:02:36 2015 UTC,Nyx! They have a huge selection of colors including blues and greens. Any they are pretty affordable.
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,CaptainCorpsie,2,Wed Jan 28 01:12:03 2015 UTC,Do you know off the top of your head an estimated price range? I liked the elf ones because they were $1-3 so I could easily buy a bunch except they have hardly any colors to choose from lol ugh!
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,mommafatpimp,6,Wed Jan 28 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"All of their fun colors (Wicked and Macaron lipsticks) are 6$ each, but all NYX stuff is buy one get one 50% off at Ulta right now!  My Beauty Addiction is an indie company with lots of fun lipsticks too and you can get little clamshell samples for 3 for 4$ Here is a user's swatches of a bunch! They also have a bunch of purples/blues/greys. The clamshells look good for a few applications to try out so you know what you like, and they have mini-size tubes for 5/each or 3 for 12. I like both MBA's and NYX's formulas but I only have the MBA ones in jars so they're annoying to put on nicely!"
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,CaptainCorpsie,1 point,Wed Jan 28 03:03:03 2015 UTC,Oh that's awesome! That's exactly what I'm looking for! I want to go crazy on lip colors but on a budget so I can see what I like on me and get actual lipsticks of them! :) thanks!
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,jenniferx302,2,Wed Jan 28 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"I think they are between $4-$6. So they are a little more than ELF, but they do have a pretty wide range of colors. Here's a link to their website with their lip products."
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,Producewarrior,3,Wed Jan 28 03:02:47 2015 UTC,"If you have a CVS, Rite Aid, or Walgreens, I would go there to see if there are Wet n Wild. The Silk Finish ($1, more hydrating and glossy) and Megalast ($2, more drying and matte) lipsticks are so worth trying out."
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,rebcart,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:08:27 2015 UTC,Awesome; thanks!!
drugstoreMUA,2twq87,rebcart,3,Thu Jan 29 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they don't have wet n wild at target or Walmart any more. I absolutely adore the matte lip colors. They don't feather and last a really long time! I'm currently wearing ""fushia with blue pearl"" from the new lipstick line they have ($.99!) and God is it gorgeous. My walgreens are doing a reset in the makeup section, so you might want to give them a week to restock."

Their most recommended brush is the expert face brush, but I haven't been able to get my hands on those yet."
drugstoreMUA,2tui84,CantTieMyLaces,5,Tue Jan 27 16:54:08 2015 UTC,I love love LOVE their sponge for foundation. I would say it's probably one of the best dupes for a beauty blender that you can find in a drugstore.

Don't really know the science around it, but I think the buffing brush gives a better finish! I always feel like the expert face brush leaves too much product and doesn't buff it away as well."

It is the best brush you can use for gel eyeliner. The tip is angled and thin so you can get super precise lines with it. I own like three brushes. One for dipbrow, one for gel eyeliner, and the other one as a backup."

The nail polishes are some of my favorites. The eyebrow gel is my HG brow product. I liked the mascaras I tried, but they have been discontinued.  I have so many Essence products on my wish list, but I'm doing a no-buy for makeup. I know I would have more to reccomend if I tried even more."

Creamy, opaque, beautiful and longlasting, so of course the whole line is also going out of stock soon!  Oh yeah, I remembered that I also have the Sun Club bronzer in ""blondes"" that's really smooth, silky and has a delicious smell, but it barely shows up on me in winter and I have pretty light skin! I guess I'm going to use it for a healthy glow in summer - it's very subtle but it makes me feel... different, in a way. Just kind of healthy and pretty, perhaps because it has a yellow tone and I don't often find yellow products :/  The ""get big! lashes"" mascaras are really volumizing. Really. Unfortunately, I don't want volumizing at all and only picked them up because they were on sale!  Nail-wise, the ""101 dalmatians"" top coat is probably the most adorable and popular polish I own, everyone comments on it and wants to try. The express dry drops are great, I couldn't do manicures without them.  Skin-wise, I'm not sure it applies to this thread, but I use the 4-in-1 anti spot cream wash and started breaking out terribly right when I stopped, soooo I should probably get another one..."

Sorry, not much  help.  I'm quite annoyed that I don't even have NYX where I live."

They're an automatic pencil and more creamy than traditional pencils so they don't dry my lips as much, and have a tackiness to them that really makes your lipstick adhere to it."
drugstoreMUA,2ttcgd,AlyseNovetti,4,Tue Jan 27 07:28:59 2015 UTC,"Lip liner definitely helps, so no matter which lipstick you use make sure you use that first. I like the NYX matte lipsticks, they last for a long time and are highly pigmented, and if you wear lip balm underneath they're not so drying either. The only thing that makes them start to rub off for me is if I eat something messy, like a sandwich, otherwise they should be fine for 5-6 hours"

drugstoreMUA,2ttcgd,Inquisitions,3,Wed Jan 28 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"My go-to for this has always been L'Oreal Infallible 2-Step Lipsticks. I have a bright red one and, when I want to not worry about it, I will use that (though I have to get my bright red online now) You put the lipstick on, let it dry for two minutes (it will feel kinda sticky for those couple minutes) and then swipe the included chapstick over it. I love them because they make it so my lips don't feel super dry and don't matte down. As long as you don't eat anything super greasy it will stay on forevers."

drugstoreMUA,2ttcgd,xMissElphiex,3,Tue Jan 27 21:58:14 2015 UTC,I bought the Maybelline Matte lipsticks and those are pretty long lasting!  I pair it up with the Milani clear lipliner and its stays on for a few hours.    You also may want to try using a finishing powder over your lipsticks to see if that helps with longevity.
drugstoreMUA,2ttcgd,lalala_meh,2,Tue Jan 27 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"Liquid lipsticks will be the longest lasting option, but they can be drying and difficult to work with. My favorite are Rimmel Provocalips, but I also like Maybelline Superstay 24hr and the new L'oreal ones (not sure the name). The Rimmel comes with a clear gloss and the other two come with a clear balm. The trick is to apply, let dry for about 3 min. without blotting or rubbing your lips together, and then apply the balm/gloss."

They're all stupid-pigmented, and I've road-tested Divine Wine a lot.  It hung tight for a dinner-turned-crazy-night with my cousin.  Wine tasting, cheese & french fries, lots of drinks, sweating, talking, etc.  I touched it up at the 4th bar we went to (or was it the 5th?) to be safe, but it was doing well. Definitely exfoliate, chapstick (legit, use the regular Chapstick brand), and line for the darker colors, though.  They can be dry if you don't prep correctly."

They're definitely a versatile product. I put a small dot on the back of my hand (a little goes a very long way!) and use a small Sonia Kashuk duo fiber cheek brush to stipple it onto my cheekbones and blend it out.

drugstoreMUA,2tqw6v,suicidie,8,Tue Jan 27 02:36:51 2015 UTC,The WnW is AMAZING!  For the price I can't recommend enough that you go try this thing out.  I tried Lorac and all kinds of Urban Decay primers.  All of them creased!  WnW doesn't crease on my lids ALL DAY.  Seriously its amazing.  The only complaint I have is that you really have to make sure you blend that stuff immediately after applying it to your lid.  I find that its really hard to get a smudge to fade if you leave it there for too long.  As long as you're careful with application I think its totally fine!
drugstoreMUA,2tqw6v,taeebaybay,3,Mon Jan 26 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"Very true about the smudge. On my skin it leaves a white cast on areas where I didn't blend it out. That white cast is hard to erase!

drugstoreMUA,2tqw6v,JulezMcCoolz,6,Mon Jan 26 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"It does have some color, I think the name is misleading. I have very pale skin and use it as all-over powder to keep my foundation in place, prevent oiliness, and cover up the redness a bit more than just foundation alone. I can't say for sure, but I think on someone with dark skin it might end up looking too light since it's not actually clear/colorless."

drugstoreMUA,2tqw6v,noel345,3,Mon Jan 26 19:33:17 2015 UTC,I put NYX Milk on over it so I haven't really noticed if it's not tacky enough because Milk is so tacky. I just love how it doesn't crease at all.

Is it really worth buying it if it costs about twice as much as I usually spend on a makeup product (besides foundation) ? I see people using it for a lot of different stuff but I just can't figure out if it's some kind of panacea product that I never knew I can't live without.
drugstoreMUA,2tqw6v,ColonialChicken,2,Mon Jan 26 21:51:25 2015 UTC,It does really increase the brightness of your eyeshadow by negating the colour of your eyelids and does give it a tacky surface for the eyeshadow to stick to. It does have downsides in that it is sort of hard to blend shadow on top of and it does crease a little. I think it's worth it if you have eyeshadow you want to stand out or eyeshadow which is weakly pigmented but not so much if you are just doing a nude eye or using pigmented colours.

Other lip suggestions I have for this sort of eye look are maybe the Revlon matte balm in Sultry or Maybelline matte Touch of Spice (both of those are a little darker and cooler toned pink than this) or Revlon Lip Butter in Sugar Plum. If you wanted to go bolder, maybe something like Milani Violet Volt or Revlon matte balm in Shameless which are both purples. Those are just a couple of other lip colors that I would probably wear with similar eye makeup if it were me :)"

Everything looks pretty neat and kept, even with the little quirkiness of your eyebrow shape (i actually like a little quirkiness to eyebrows).   My only CC would be to go darker on the eyebrow color to match your hair more closely. Its a bit off being so much lighter than your hair and also try to soften the corners of your eyebrows towards the nose so its not so bluntly rounded off. Usually just applying the product with a lighter hand than the rest of the brow. I think the elf brow kit in dark brown would be great for you.   Otherwise, thumbs up!"
drugstoreMUA,2tsgdi,MisogynistLesbian,1 point,Tue Jan 27 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the CC! As I mentioned in another reply, I have really sparse brows towards the inside and they have no shape. So I have to really pack on the product to make it show up and defined. Any suggestions on how I could use less but still have shape? Also, my hair is only a shade or so darker than my brows so I don't know if going darker would be a good idea. The problem is that my hair has an ash base but they don't make eyebrow products in anything close to that in browns (I know they have lighter colors that are ash tone)."
drugstoreMUA,2tsgdi,MisogynistLesbian,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Try the elf brow kit. Its only $3 and it has a lighter brown powder that you can use if you dont like the darker brown cream/wax. I read somewhere that your eyebrows should match the darkest shade of your hair.   I have dark brown hair and i use to go lighter brown for my eyebrows because i was worried about looking too harsh if i went darker but im really glad i did. It really pulls the look together and makes hair and eyebrows seamless. Im going based off of what i can see from your hair pulled back but even judging by your pre-makeup eyebrows, i think your dark eyebrow hair color should be matched instead of going lighter. I hope you understand what i mean. Just my opinion, but maybe you can try it out and see if you like it :)  As for the inner eyebrow, i have the same problem. Normally what i do is lightly draw in the shape i want, then lightly fill in the shape by quickly and lightly drawing my brush/pencil upward to kind of feather the product upward to mimic eyebrow hairs. When i do it too dark, i take a q-tip, slightly dampen it and quickly and lightly brush upwards on the inner part of the eyebrow where i want to remove some product to lighten it up a bit. It takes some practice but i got the hang of it after a week of trying it out.   Hope this helped!"

Might not want to use this as an under eye concealer because it's thick and may settle into creases, but definitely amazing for blemishes and scarring.  They do have a concealer called Hard Candy Glamoflauge Lite which comes as a dual stick. One is a lighter/brightener shade and the other a bit darker for blemishes. Both are super cheap found at Wal-Mart. I use the Lite version under my eyes and the Heavy on blemishes and acne scarring."

How can you figure out which concealer will match your skin tone? For mid to high-end concealer I feel it's easier since you can use testers in store, but drugstore concealers are packaged so you can't really patch test. Every time I buy one, I kind of eyeball it and the color somewhat matches, but even when it's blended in you can tell the color is off if you look closely. Is it just trial and error?"

It comes in an amazing range of shades so it can be used for highlighting and contouring if you like.  I love it over my dark hyperpigmentation.    For color correcting I like NYX Above & Beyond Concealer in Orange and Green.  Green will cancel out any redness, and Orange works great to cancel out purple or brown marks."

It has a lot of good reviews which is why I repurchase, and it does take away a little bit of my dark undereye circles however it doesn't completely eradicate them which is why I'm hoping to switch to a different brand soon. Everyone else I've seen use it hasn't had the same issues I have with it unfortunately, and I think that's largely b/c my undereye circles are very dark. I'm thinking I'll have to invest in a corrector to use prior to concealer."

I'll use this on areas of my face that wouldn't look too bad without coverage through the day and my Rimmel Lasting Finish for longer/better coverage on other spots (chin and forehead for hormonal acne/scars)  My skin type is pretty normal/combo.

drugstoreMUA,2tscze,Angry_Devotchka,2,Tue Jan 27 02:56:55 2015 UTC,"Foundation is actually the only product that I only go prestige for now - couldn't quite match my undertones just right (plenty of Good Enoughs, though).  However, before that, I was a huge fan of CoverGirl Outlast Stay Fabulous 3-in-1 and keep it around for occasional use. It's a full coverage, fairly easy to apply foundation, for those of us who want the max finish.    They have a better skintone range than most foundation lines in the drugstore, and the Queen Collection 3-in-1, which is the same formula, covers even more shades. Overall a rather nice choice."

drugstoreMUA,2tr10y,duchessofsephora,6,Tue Jan 27 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"I love Maybelline Color Tattoos. My favorites are Creamy Beige and Pomegranate Punk. Great on their own and great as a base for powder shadows.  My trick to applying them is to use a dense, flat paddle-shaped brush with synthetic bristles that is worthless for powder eyeshadows. The brush puts on an even layer and you can blend out the edges.   I'm looking forward to trying ELF Smudge Pots because a recent post in Makeup Addiction demonstrated that they are not in fact smudgy, but set up for long wear like the Color Tattoos, and they're like half the price."
drugstoreMUA,2tr10y,M_tridactyla,4,Mon Jan 26 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"I also really like the color tattoos. I apply them with my finger which I find to provide the most color saturation for these, and then blend out the edges quickly with a fluffy brush since they sort of set quickly. They're really good colors on their own but also make great bases to boost other eyeshadow color and give interesting dimension, but I would still recommend a primer under them. I have Pomegranate Punk (shimmery burgundy), Tough as Taupe (matte taupe), Audacious Asphalt (shimmery grey), Barely Branded (shimmery champagne), and Fierce and Tangy (matte tangerine orange). The formula and pigmentation seems consistent amongst all these colors. Tough as Taupe and Barely Branded are fantastic ""I don't feel like doing shit"" colors because you can just sweep them across your lid as the only thing and it looks pretty damn good.  As others have also recommended, Wet n Wild makes some really good shadows too. They are surprisingly buttery and blend really well, but depending on the color have some pretty hefty fallout, so I tend to do my eyes first before foundation/bb cream/what have you. My favorite is the Comfort Zone palette, especially the lower right color, it looks exactly like the MAC blue brown pigment. Oh and that palette is only like 3 or 4 dollars!"

I only own three because stores here only sell a small selection. I own Vintage Romance, Oh So Special and Storm and I picked them all based on any colours of interest they had. I really like Oh So Special because it is extremely wearable without containing just nude shades and has lovely rose golds. I also like Vintage Romance but it is less wearable and contains a lot of purples. Storm is wearable too but it contains more nudes than the other two. My only complaint is that sometimes the palettes contain two or three quite similar shades which is both good if you like the shade and bad if you don't."
drugstoreMUA,2tr10y,M_tridactyla,2,Mon Jan 26 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"You can also likely get it from Amazon-- at least you can in the States. I don't know if it would be any more cost effective, though."

I've not duped, but made a remarkably similar match for nearly all of Naked 2 from them.  First I hated them, the payout was awful and I was miserable, then I roughed up the surface of them after I saw a mention someone felt they got more pigmented the longer they used it. Voila! Much better!"

drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,classylady87,21,Mon Jan 26 14:56:56 2015 UTC,All of the people suggesting she save up and buy dipbrow that's great but there's just one problem... It's totally NOT drugstore which is the point of this entire sub. I use a NYC kohl brow/liner pencil to lightly outline the shape and then fill in/blend with Nyx eyebrow cake. I've been using this combo for a few months and it's pretty solid. I know everyone is saying that dipbrow lasts but honestly this duo and even the nyx powder and wax alone last me until I'm ready to take off my makeup for the day. They even last product-wise. I've only purchased one of the eyebrow cakes over 6 months ago and I feel like I've barely made a dent. The next brow product I've had my eyes on trying is Revlon brow fantasy. It's a pencil/tinted gel duo and it comes in 4-5 colors. Hard candy is also releasing a pencil/fiberized colored gel duo soon and I've been eyeing that as well. Hope this helps!!
drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,cali4nia_dreams,3,Mon Jan 26 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"The Revlon brow fantasy is REALLY a good product, my only beef with it( and honestly why I eventually moved on) is that I had to repurchase it like.. EVERY Payday. Product, amazing... Quantity for price, not so much."

drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,MermaidMermaid,2,Mon Jan 26 17:40:39 2015 UTC,That's what I use every day. I actually really need more wax.
drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,StrobesNQueens,2,Mon Jan 26 21:28:31 2015 UTC,Stupid question: are you supposed to apply the wax with the brush or the spool? I always seem to put too much on.
drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,Juliaowlstar,7,Mon Jan 26 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"I use the angled brush. This person says she uses her finger (which I feel like would not work at all for me, but her brows are perfect so obviously something is going well)."

I have very dark (almost black) hair, so I had been using just a regular black eyeshadow to fill in my brows until now.

I bowed down to /r/MUA peer pressure and bought Dipbrow, but I like Mink Brown better.  It's easier to use and it's only a buck.  When my brows are being really unruly, I'll set them with Milani's Clear Brow Gel."

I also use Maybelline Define-a-Brow which is a twist-up pencil. Before that, I used MUFE aqua brow.   As someone mentioned before, NYX eyebrow gel is a dupe for MUFE aqua brow so that would be closes to dipbrow (as opposed to a pencil or powder). Not sure if there are any exact dupes for dipbrow."

drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,Nanya_business,5,Mon Jan 26 16:38:06 2015 UTC,I personally use a pencil from Daiso (Japanese dollar store) but I have a friend who swears by NYX's brow products. I'm almost sure it's a dip brow and she says it only costs her $5.
drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,sugarvenomohyeah,8,Mon Jan 26 15:14:47 2015 UTC,I think nyx recently came out with a brow gel thing in a tube that is supposed to be a dupe for MUFE aquabrow

drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,Halloedangel,3,Mon Jan 26 17:34:47 2015 UTC,Depending on your brow color the elf cream eyeliner might work for you! I have black hair and use a bit of the black and the dark brown mixed together. It lasts for a long time and looks like Dipbrow.
drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,M_tridactyla,3,Mon Jan 26 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"If you've got medium to dark brown brows I cannot recommend the e.l.f gel liner in Coffee more. It's a neutral-ish cool brown with a really nice creamy consistency. It stays crisp all day, no problem, and it's really easy to work with. A very light hand makes it more subtle and light but you can definitely make it darker and more pronounced. It's nice for going between more natural makeup and needing bolder brows to balance intense eye makeup. I made a post about it a few months ago on /r/makeupaddiction here if you'd like to read more :)"

drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,gamplayerx,2,Mon Jan 26 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"the wet n wild eyebrow kit is awesome, and very comparable to anastasia's brow powder duo's in my opinion.  its 3 dollars and comes w/ two shades and a wax, and a little brush and tweezers.  its really pigmented and applies well.  the only thing is lasting power compared to abh, but it is still pretty awesome for 3 bucks!!!"
drugstoreMUA,2tq38k,Candychem,2,Mon Jan 26 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"Avon brow pencil is so cheap and has a great shade range! they have a great blonde shade that isn't too red or dark, which is perfect for me.   I love to use the NYX control freak brow gel because it keeps the brows in place quite well, and the stopper keeps too much product from coming out of the tube (unlike with Maybelline clear mascara). Nyx also makes a great brow wax in a pencil form which REALLY keeps them in place.  Finally, my most recent purchase is the Sonia Kashuk Brow kit; it's not extremely pigmented like Anastasia dipbrow is, but it comes with four shades (blonde, medium brown, chocolate brown, auburn) and since it isn't so pigmented, it's easy to get a softer but still defined look, and the product is buildable. As a blonde, I don't mind that, because its easy for me to go overboard with colour and then look crazy!"

The wand takes some getting used to-- you brush it through your brows backwards, then forwards-- but once I figured that out it works fantastically to add natural definition to my puny eyebrows.  Hard Candy Brows Now is a fiberized brow gel kind of like Benefit Gimme Lash. Its advantages are that it has a small brush and both shades are taupey-neutral. It's good, but I like the Maybelline one better.  I haven't tried it yet, but L'Oreal has a new fiberized gel also."

drugstoreMUA,2tqd3g,Nanya_business,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:58:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know how the liquid version is, but I just bought the FitMe Foundation in stick form. This is my first foundation, and I bought it because I wanted something with a tad more coverage than my BB cream - and I'm surprisingly very pleased with it! I have very dry skin and I needed something that wouldn't emphasize my flakies and I also wanted something with enough coverage to mostly cover up the semi dark circles under my eyes (I'm having a real tough time with concealer under my eyes lately, my skin is being so troublesome that every concealer I try winds up looking cakey and emphasizing dryness, so I had enough). I would call it a light coverage with a nice and natural finish, but a little more coverage than a BB cream. It's enough to make my skin look really nice and even, and it mostly covers up pimples. You could build it up, but I'm not sure how much before it would look cakey. It sounds like you're after the same things as me, so I recommend it! BB cream might also be a solution for you though depending on how much you want to cover, I use the Maybelline Dream Pure BB Cream and I like it. It's a small step under the foundation, like nothing->tinted moisturizer->that bb cream->that foundation."
drugstoreMUA,2tqd3g,DrSassyPants,2,Mon Jan 26 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Liquid is what I was looking for. I'm currently using a powder and it helps even out the tone but I don't like the finish much. I'm pretty red(not alot of blemishes just uneven) but I think this is what I'm looking for, I have a correcting primer too. Most everything else I've seen recommended has been expensive and full coverage. Appreciate it!"

drugstoreMUA,2tqd3g,MrsDrNotSoHorrible,3,Mon Jan 26 17:24:55 2015 UTC,I love the True Match lumi! I use the liquid. I tried it because I read that it's a dupe for YSL's Touch Eclat foundation. The liquid is very nice- goes on smoothly and builds well.

I like the loreal true match (both regular and lumi) but I've just started using the Covergirl TruBlend and I love it. The formula is really thin/light and doesn't cling to dry patches especially when I use a beauty blender ! Large shade range as well.

My skin does get red with any sort of rubbing (cleansing, moisturizing, applying foundations with fingers or brushes, etc.) and have found that using a Beauty Blender to apply foundation is least irritating/causes the least redness.  Might be a useful tip for others with sensitive skin."
drugstoreMUA,2tqd3g,MargotTennenbaum,2,Mon Jan 26 17:37:47 2015 UTC,Yes! A makeup sponge has been super helpful for me. I didn't even realize how irritating even a super soft makeup brush can be until I tried the Real Techniques beauty blender dupe.
drugstoreMUA,2tqd3g,PrincessMunchkin_,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:40:00 2015 UTC,I'd think it's also a good choice for people with dry skin because it won't lift up any dry bits and make them look scale-like.

drugstoreMUA,2trgxl,MagicBean18,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:17:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! Does it actually dry matte? And what would you say the coverage is like?
drugstoreMUA,2trgxl,MagicBean18,2,Tue Jan 27 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"It dries pretty matte, although I usually put on a bit of loose powder anyway because my nose and forehead tend to shine through whatever I put on my face. I've never used a lot of foundation in the past, so I don't have a lot to compare the coverage to, but for me, I think it covers really well. My skin is pretty uneven, but after putting this on, it looks even and smooth, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. One thing I really like about it is that it does a decent job covering my undereye circles...I don't even bother with concealer when I wear the BB cream."

drugstoreMUA,2trgxl,horse__tornado,2,Tue Jan 27 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"Oh dear I personally would have to warn you away from it! Revlon's ColourStay foundation in Buff is my shade, and the lightest of the BB cream was too dark for me. It does dry matte, but doesn't stay that way on me. I also found it horribly oxidises to an orange and transfers after long hours of wear. Also tends to cling to any dry patches of skin. When it first goes on it's okay but then it's downhill from there. :("
drugstoreMUA,2tqqm6,MissRepresentation,16,Mon Jan 26 18:02:49 2015 UTC,I like drugstore best for mascara. I've really never found a high or mid end mascara that was even close to worth the extra $20 or so.  Drugstore foundation is one of the only things I can never see myself going back to using. I can't find a shade that matches and it's too difficult to really research one without having testers available.
drugstoreMUA,2tqqm6,lainecummings,2,Mon Jan 26 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, I totally forgot about mascara. I should edit my post. I don't think I'll ever buy a high end mascara. Just... Not worth it. I go through them so quickly and my eyelashes are so finicky anyway."
drugstoreMUA,2tqqm6,Erinescence,2,Mon Jan 26 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but you REALLY do need to toss any opened mascaras w/in 3 months of opening for safety reasons.  I don't follow the guidelines for when to toss every makeup product, but I don't monkey with my eyes at all. ;)"
drugstoreMUA,2tqqm6,sleekkills,10,Mon Jan 26 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"I would probably never buy a high end mascara or gel liner; my $5 Maybelline mascara and my $3 Essence gel liner do just what I need them to, and the price is so right. Lipstick and nail polish is something that I'll also stick to drugstore with unless there's a really unique color or packaging, or if I just want a fun splurge that I'll actually get use out of.  I wish drugstores had a better shade range for base products, and also better primers, both for the eyes and face. I also wish it was easier to find good contour products at drugstore level, but I think this year that will change, starting with the NYX contour palette."
drugstoreMUA,2tqqm6,sleekkills,4,Mon Jan 26 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, but the contour palette is listed as $30 on NYX's website. :/ it really sucks because $30 for a contour palette just isn't really drugstore pricing. I've bought a shit ton of midrange eyeshadow palettes for less than that! The Anastasia contour palette is only about $10 more so it's hardly worth it to get the NYX one. I'm just so disappointed in NYX's price point for that :/"

And it sucks that you can't really find the shade you need with ALLL OF THE TESTERS THEY HAVE! /s  For brow pomade, try a gel eyeliner type product. I've seen a couple blogs about that. I used to mix the powder and wax from the NYX eyebrow set I had that worked well.    Edit: Agree about the shadows! They all are just so hard and not as finely milled as I would like.  They definitely do not blend as good but are fine for lid colors or whatever.   I would say try the nikka k shadows if they stock those at your drugstores. They're not hard packed so there is a lot of product you can pick up. They blend well but are not that finely milled so there is a different look."

drugstoreMUA,2tpm19,Yunachoo,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:57:48 2015 UTC,I love Elf .. I have so many of their products they are my go to everyday. Helps extend the life of my fancier products. The eyeshadows make me happy such good pigmentation for such a low price. Nail polish is pretty rockin as well.

drugstoreMUA,2tpm19,hamcheesehamcheese,1 point,Sun Feb 1 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"Liner: I love NYC liquid liner. It's fantastic for the price. I use it with my own liner brush instead of the one that comes with it but that's my preference. It's all I will buy, forever and ever.   Lipstick: Gotta be NYX. I own like two dozen NYX lipsticks, mostly the matte lipsticks, but also plenty of the creamy round case and matte creams. Love love love. Not to say that there are brands I dislike, but they are by far my favorite.   Powder: NYC wins again! Their Smooth Skin powder is fantastic, really. Super cheap and is awesome for going under or over liquid foundation. For on the go, I love Rimmel's Stay Matte.   Mascara: I'm pretty split between Covergirl and Maybelline. I haven't found my go to yet, but I've only been truly disappointed a few times by these brands. Other brands(boo L'Oréal and NYX!) do me wrong every time.   Eye primer: Wet n Wild ! Holy shit, that stuff blew my mind! I used to use TFSI but I ran out unexpectedly one day and needed a replacement fast for little cash, and I am never going back.   Face primer: Rimmel Stay Matte. I tried so so soooo many high end and mid range primers and none of them worked even a little bit. This one is great, and super cheap. I'll never try to 'upgrade' again."
drugstoreMUA,2tqfhn,mariettee,5,Mon Jan 26 16:39:16 2015 UTC,I have always seen people recommend /r/makeupexchange because most people are willing to send out samples of what they have. I don't think drugstore products do samples (?) so this might be your best bet.
drugstoreMUA,2tqfhn,sugarbees,2,Mon Jan 26 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you would consider them drugstore since they're priced in that range but not actually found in drugstores, but I know Sleek Makeup does samples of their foundations that you can order."
