bonnaroo,3e36bp,johnfoof,41,Tue Jul 21 16:34:56 2015 UTC,Aren't our expectations usually unrealistically high anyways?
bonnaroo,3e36bp,Drizzy_Drew,12,Tue Jul 21 16:50:43 2015 UTC,Should they be even higher than our usual high expectations?
bonnaroo,3e36bp,remeard,8,Tue Jul 21 16:54:24 2015 UTC,"Move the hype level up to ""unusually higher unrealistic expectations""."
bonnaroo,3e36bp,Drizzy_Drew,7,Tue Jul 21 16:58:25 2015 UTC,Hype level 20 confirmed.
bonnaroo,3e36bp,remeard,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"Part of me wants to say yes, because Bonnaroo does like to celebrate these kinds of things. But I also don't want to be disappointed when it's not Daft Punk/Radiohead/2nd Grateful Dead Reunion.   I think they'll do more of a throwback thing and have more jam-type bands that have been there from the beginning like Primus, Widespread Panic, whatever Phil Lesh is doing now, etc. That kind of thing. I can even see My Morning Jacket or Jim James doing something even though they played this year."
bonnaroo,3e36bp,subjectWarlock,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"I'd really love more throw backs, loved the theme tents and the curated stages in the past years.  David Byrne brought some great bands to the festival that I had no idea about that became instant favorites (Katzenjammer!), Eugene Hutz brought world music and jammed with EVERY BAND that played on his stage (with the exception of maybe one?).  Bluegrass Situation sort of does this, and I think they've been doing a damn fine job the past few years.  That being said, I still think they should do a ""Night of the Living Dead"" theme.  All day have bands comprised of members or of The Grateful Dead or tribute bands.  Bob Weir, Lesh, Hart, Kreutzmann, Lesh, Anastasio, Dark Star, etc.  with a superjam at the end going on until ??? with rotating members."

bonnaroo,3e36bp,thegroovemonkey,4,Tue Jul 21 19:31:31 2015 UTC,This is the unrealistically high expectations thread. Get your rational thinking and logic out of here
bonnaroo,3e36bp,remeard,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:42 2015 UTC,That tour started in 2006...
bonnaroo,3e36bp,ValarMorghulis37,11,Tue Jul 21 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"Well, to put it into perspective the 2011 (ten year anniversary) lineup really didn't have anything that was ""bucket list"" material.  Eminem was, as many would agree, one of the most disappointing headliners Roo has had with an underwhelming performance and Widespread Panic was headlining 6th Bonnaroo in ten years.  Arcade Fire was great, but was kind of the Go-To headliner that year with The Suburbs just being released.  Now, the rest of the lineup was absolutely amazing.  Buffalo Springfield, Black Keys, Mumford, Florence, MMJ, Robert Plant, Dr. John Superjam, Gogol Bordello who curated and played with an entire day's stage."
bonnaroo,3e36bp,Drizzy_Drew,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:43 2015 UTC,I think a Led Zeppelin reunion is a reasonable request.
bonnaroo,3e36bp,somuchsublime,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:15 2015 UTC,It's unreasonable. Robert Plant has no desire to do a reunion tour.
bonnaroo,3e36bp,mayor_of_canada,9,Tue Jul 21 18:29:14 2015 UTC,So Led Zeppelin confirmed?
bonnaroo,3e36bp,thegroovemonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:57 2015 UTC,What is Led may never die
bonnaroo,3e36bp,RG3TD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"It sounds reasonable, and I really can't see why they don't do it unless they just don't want to."
bonnaroo,3e36bp,travel__time,8,Tue Jul 21 17:19:46 2015 UTC,no.
bonnaroo,3e36bp,Stuppyhead,9,Tue Jul 21 17:16:49 2015 UTC,Agreed. They want to sell as many tickets and generate as much buzz as possible. Roo is going to try and make the best lineup they can every single year.
bonnaroo,3e36bp,oneinchterror,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:39 2015 UTC,Exactly
bonnaroo,3e36bp,mrpapadopolous,6,Tue Jul 21 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think so... They haven't seemed to hype it up like they did the 10th anniversary. If I remember correctly, there was a giant sign in Centeroo that said ""be on the lookout for the 10th anniversary next year"" the year before.  For the 10th anniversary all they really did was put an emphasis on parades I think, and 10th is a more significant milestone than 15th."

bonnaroo,3e36bp,somuchsublime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"In a sense, he's right. If you were married in 2002, 2003 would be your 1 year anniversary not your 2 year. That would make 2016 your 14 year anniversary"
bonnaroo,3e36bp,letterbonn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:41:18 2015 UTC,I'm confused
bonnaroo,3e36bp,letterbonn,2,Tue Jul 21 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"2016 is definitely the 15th Bonnaroo. But I don't know if it's accurate to call it the 15 year anniversary (or the 15th anniversary). As per my example, you definitely wouldn't call 2016 your 15 year wedding anniversary.  According to Wikipedia, /u/somuchsublime is completely correct:  ""For example, the first event is the initial occurrence or, if planned, the inaugural of the event. One year later would be the first anniversary of that event"""

bonnaroo,3e39n0,rhinowing,7,Tue Jul 21 19:40:50 2015 UTC,A ton of respect for that.
bonnaroo,3e39n0,Teddy_Raptor,7,Tue Jul 21 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"they didn't make camp bisco a nightmare. there was a few standing at the gate that were dicks, and a photo was taken that got spread around and probably blown a bit out of proportion.  i didn't have any issues with nectar fans at roo or bisco"
bonnaroo,3e39n0,getting2birdsstoned,6,Tue Jul 21 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge bassnectar fan and I'm not speaking for the whole group of fans but I'll say what I think.  With ANY fanbase, you get assholes. Especially with die hard fans of any music, activity, whatever, you get entitleism. Those assholes stand out the most and give everyone a bad idea. That's what happened here I assume. Some nectar fans have literally followed the dude around the country and seen him 50 times. It's more than just a concert to them, it's literally their life. Not saying it's right or wrong, that's just how it is. They think they have some right that they don't have and it shows  The whole bassnectar community is based on love for music and community. People who are acting differently than that are not true ""bassheads""."
bonnaroo,3e39n0,Teddy_Raptor,10,Tue Jul 21 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"I found Bassnectar to be a really relaxed crowd at Roo.  Everyone was happy and spaced out well, and generally having a great time.  Probably in my top three crowd vibes for this year (other two being Mumford & MMJ).  On a side note, some guy literally ran through me and a couple others like a charging bull during Billy Joel (which is why I decided to leave Sunday instead of Monday).  I was pissed and shocked and it ruined my night.  (And if that man happens to read this... FUCK YOU.)"
bonnaroo,3e39n0,barefootbohemian,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:11 2015 UTC,That guy ran over me just before he got to the front. Guy was an asssssss

bonnaroo,3e39n0,barefootbohemian,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:03 2015 UTC,Nope. Right side near the center divider and front near the divider between pit and general.
bonnaroo,3e39n0,isubird33,10,Wed Jul 22 00:15:02 2015 UTC,Was in the line for the pit at nectar this year and can confirm that this was not the case at all. The security told us several times that we were the best most respectful crowd of the weekend thus far. People were kind and everyone I talked to was amazing. Bisco just has a few bad apples that ruined the image of bassheads as a whole. But the bonnaroo code doesn't tolerate that shit.
bonnaroo,3e39n0,galvinb1,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"They were fine at Bisco. There were a few of them that sat in the pit all day which I'm sure was kind of annoying to the people that wanted pit for the other shows, but mostly they were all awesome. If anything it was The Disco Biscuits fans that were being the biggest dicks all weeekend, talking shit about Bassnectar and EDM in general."
bonnaroo,3e39n0,DrPaulProteus_,4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any trouble with them at Roo, but I saw Bassnectar at Red Rocks and the fans there definitely hindered my experience. They were not happy I was as close as I was and I did not show up at sunrise to get that close."
bonnaroo,3e39n0,RoyalJayhawkChief,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you be mad, too? I think people deserve the front if they wait a long time and I would be bitter if I waited 12 hours and some dude strolls right up to the front and gets in front of those who did put in the time for a good spot UNLESS it's a situation like this. These people were being dicks by blocking people who wanted to see other artists and not respecting the artists playing."
bonnaroo,3e39n0,Teddy_Raptor,3,Tue Jul 21 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"Nobody DESERVES anything. If you HAD to wait 12 hours to be up front, then that's just the best YOU could do. Don't get mad just because somebody else is better at living their life. If they made it to the front 10min before a show, AND have not 1. Aggressively pushed their way in or 2. Stepped on anyone, then you are just jealous. ""They got to enjoy their day AND see Bassnectar up front!? I'm soo mad!"" Be mad at yourself."
bonnaroo,3e39n0,NickFromNOLA,2,Tue Jul 21 23:11:54 2015 UTC,I got picked to be in the pit at random and everyone was really nice.   EXCEPT the die hard fans.. They were acting insane like they needed extra space to head bang. and like they acted like they had a chip on their shoulder because you could tell they were die hard fans. I really dont know how to explain it. But I know exactly what they are talking about
bonnaroo,3e39n0,SpaGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean, its like a really self-centered, negative twist on being a groupie. Can't say I've met TOO many that were like that, but it's definitely out there"
bonnaroo,3e39n0,funkycrunkskunks,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds more like a management issue. Clear the pits after every show. Furthermore, people want to watch their favorite artist get over it. Don't write an entire article flaming an entire fan base, based on an experience with 5 teenagers."
bonnaroo,3e39n0,POZKNOWS,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he stressed that the troublesome individuals were in the minority among the full basshead populace"
bonnaroo,3e39n0,funkycrunkskunks,3,Tue Jul 21 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"Regardless, he/she felt the need to write the article with an headline basically insinuating bassnectar fans, as a whole, ruined an entire festival. The parenthetical (some) just serves as an easy out for when people inevitably would get offended. It's like when people say ""I don't mean to be rude/racist/homophobic/anything but...."""

I'm sure every show is different though, so maybe Bisco just got a bit unlucky? Super bummer if that is the case cause Bassnectar is the jam."
bonnaroo,3e39n0,poisonivychick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't see any of this. I did meet one guy who was one of the ""I'm gonna be in line at noon, brahhh. Gonna be on the rail for Nectar, duuude"" types and I did find him to be generally dismissive of most of the other acts that were at Roo, which is insane to me. Bassnectar and PL are cool but some people act like that's the only legitimate music out there.  BTW, saw all of Slayer and some of Mumford, got in line for the Bassnectar pit right before the show, and I was in the third row. I honestly feel sorry for you if you spend your whole Saturday at Roo doing nothing but waiting around for one act to go on."
bonnaroo,3e4r8a,Zovable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:01 2015 UTC,Florence's set was like a religious experience. I was in the pit and I cried almost the whole time. So much energy and it was the final day there were a lot of emotions haha

bonnaroo,3e0njp,jcohle,3,Tue Jul 21 10:21:30 2015 UTC,I saw them 3 times within that week span and everytime they put on an amazing performance. Definitely top 5 shows from Roo this year.

bonnaroo,3e0njp,specs87,2,Tue Jul 21 05:20:00 2015 UTC,They got my Lionel Richie award. It goes to the artist that I didn't really have any expectations of who then blows me out of the water.

bonnaroo,3dz7e8,NayItReallyHappened,7,Mon Jul 20 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"I tried to convince him to have it at Roo, he unfortunately hasn't seen the light."
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,remeard,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"Outsidelands in San Fransisco is put on by the same group and often share similar lineups, same could be said about Forecastle.  Even though a bit of it was a mess this year, I've heard good things about Firefly and their staff and crowd.  I've seen some great crowd videos at Sasquatch, which I think they do two a year now."
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,mrsealittle,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:46 2015 UTC,"I've been to Firefly in 2013 and 2014, fun times but different vibes than Roo in my opinion. Outsidelands and Sasquatch have definitely caught my attention the past few years. Have you been to either before?"
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,letterbonn,6,Mon Jul 20 19:24:23 2015 UTC,Sasquatch is incredible. Similar vibes to roo for sure. The gorge is one of the most amazing things to look at while tripping tho. I also prefer it to roo with respect to weather and crowds. You can get quite close at any stage due to the setup and the fewer people in attendance.  I think sasquatch is a great alternative. (Roo always will hold a special place in my heart tho)
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,remeard,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"Crowds have always been my one complaint about Roo, it makes it special but they've been getting out of control the past year or two."

Thursdays are terrible, they really need to book some stage acts for thursday.  Other than that, the only show that I felt was too cramped and we had to leave was the PL superjam."
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,festivus4darest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"Afraid not, just seen seen photos and videos, seemed fairly similar crowds - especially at Sasquatch."
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,GoonerTau,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"I did both this year. Biggest difference between the crowds would be the following: age, how far people came, and general friendliness.   Sasquatch is a younger crowd. Lots of high school/college aged, without as many older folks (though they are there).   It's pretty regional. Tons of Washington/Oregon/Idaho/Canada, with a sprinkling of California (which, admittedly is a lot of space!)   It felt more like people were closed off than Roo. My camping experience was amazing and people were super friendly, but it was more of once you actually got into the venue. I think it has to do with their main stage (which is just incredible. like best stage to watch a show ever) being super conducive to sitting down and taking in a show COMBINED with the fact that people don't seem to have to go solo as much to shows. At Bonnaroo you almost HAVE to at some point go at it alone and you make friends with people who dig the same act the way you do. Didn't feel that way so much at Sasquatch.   I went with some of my best friends to Sasquatch and spent part of the time solo. I went with my little brother's friends to Bonnaroo and spent most of it solo. I had a much better time at Bonnaroo! Definitely comparable though and if you haven't been you need to go. It will be a tad more expensive, for less value."
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,UndeadBurg,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"Just got back from Forecastle... for a small, urban festival it certainly has a bit of a Roo-vibe.  Pretty good lineup, not too crowded... even got free parking a block from the event after arriving at like noon  on Sunday.  The stages all had great sound quality, without bleeding into one another as well.  It's no replacement for Roo, but definitely recommended if you live close by (Indianapolis, Louisville, Cincinnati... maybe even Nashville)."
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,downtowneil,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:18 2015 UTC,I definitely second your thoughts on Forecastle. Was really impressed with the sound and stage setups. Portugal the Man was probably the best show I've seen all summer.

bonnaroo,3dz7e8,tshannon,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"Depending on lineups (obviously), I'm thinking of skipping Roo this year in favor of Sasquatch. I've only heard and seen great things about it and now that I live out west, it seems more practical."
bonnaroo,3dz7e8,knomesayin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:52 2015 UTC,I'm also considering skipping Roo for Sasquatch. I wanna go on a month long trip outside of the US next summer. So idk how likely i can do both Sasquatch and the trip as I live in Florida.  Roo + trip = definitely doable  sasquatch + trip = pushing limits.

bonnaroo,3du95b,dgapa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:10 2015 UTC,It was alright.  Not my favorite album and I don't plan on listening to it many more times.  I found it a little mellow for my taste.  I much prefer Ratatat's new album.
bonnaroo,3du95b,lammnub,4,Sun Jul 19 15:26:08 2015 UTC,"Ratatat's new album sounded just like all of their other albums... that being said, I'm not surprised you weren't into Currents"
bonnaroo,3du95b,luvbeats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:49:02 2015 UTC,I can't listen to another Ratatat album that sounds exactly like the others. They are dead to me

bonnaroo,3du95b,The-Sinister-Kid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:54 2015 UTC,what hidden tracks!? I have the same 2 disk set and there are no such tracks
bonnaroo,3du95b,thickplot207,2,Sun Jul 19 20:09:16 2015 UTC,You probably didn't realize it cuz there just instrumentals at the end of sides A and B. But they're there.

bonnaroo,3dul44,dumfuq,3,Sun Jul 19 17:37:38 2015 UTC,The only good thing about the Basslights argument is that it will die faster than the Kanye debacle
bonnaroo,3dul44,samm1t,6,Sun Jul 19 18:25:42 2015 UTC,I don't think the Kanye debacle will ever end. I expect to see fuck Kanye spray painted on the walls for years.
bonnaroo,3dul44,remeard,5,Sun Jul 19 18:37:53 2015 UTC,It is ingrained as much to the Bonnaroo Culture as terrible sound control at the Which Stage.

bonnaroo,3dul44,5hawnking5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"still gonna voice my opinion that the lack of sunrise sets this last year was pretty weak.  Not gonna point at livenation, not gonna assume ""none of the artists were into it"" either.  Kalliope is fun, but I was really hoping for a tent show to go till sunup.  STS9 and PL have both gone to sunup at ALL of their past roo's.   Not a single tent act till sunup?  whats the deal?  also Kalliope fed into the BassLights hype by publically posting on their FB's ""let give the people what they want"""
bonnaroo,3dul44,5hawnking5,0,Mon Jul 20 18:26:57 2015 UTC,I don't disagree. The festival duration seemed a little shorter with shows on some stages starting at 3 and ending  earlier. In past years it felt as if music never stopped. I did not get that feeling this year. Although we still had a blast and I will certainly be back for years to come.
bonnaroo,3dul44,thedfrichtel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"the sets even seemed shorter.  no doubt, im only nitpicking details now, this year was my favorite overall since i started attending in 06"
