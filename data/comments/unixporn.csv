unixporn,3e2xmx,bbenne10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe try setting t_Co=16. (or override the colorscheme a bit, but that's more complicated) There's some guessing in colorschemes when using colors above 16 as most terminal programs either don't allow setting those colors (or, more frequently, people don't bother to set them). It looks like gruvbox is using some magic to switch around the colors used based on the number of reported colors available. (see https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox/blob/master/colors/gruvbox.vim#L143 for one spot it's happening) My guess is that the color at index #167 isn't exactly the same color that's at index #9 (which would get set when changing the terminal colorscheme to gruvbox)  Coincedentally, I'm using gruvbox - I'll test out at lunch and report back"
unixporn,3e2xmx,bbenne10,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"Okay. It looks like there's a variable to set that red up. Before calling ""colorscheme gruvbox"", just call ""let g:gruvbox_termcolors=16"". This will limit you to using only 16 colors (and may make the palette suck in other ways), but it will give you that particular red. I just tested like so: vim -u ~/.vim_gb, where ~/.vim_gb contains only:  if empty(glob('~/.nvim/autoload/plug.vim'))   silent !curl -fLo ~/.nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs     \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim   autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall endif  call plug#begin('~/.nvim/bundle') Plug 'morhetz/gruvbox' call plug#end()  let g:gruvbox_termcolors=16 colorscheme gruvbox   The plug stuff is just vim-plug (because I already had gruvbox installed, I figured I'd just use that copy). The real business happens at the let call.   You can visually see that the red is indeed different than the one prior (and looks to be the same as the red you're asking about)"

Some wm's will call the script from their config, some you start with your .xinitrc. But yes, you are correct that generally you'll have a script in your $PATH, most use ~/bin.  In your script you'll create a parent function, which contains specific functions to extract the information you need (battery, memory, etc) from your system, slice and dice with sed, awk, cut for display, and echo out. You'll then echo your parent function inside a loop and pipe through lemonbar. visual Lastly call the script from .xinitrc     yourscript &     You'll have to supply your own logic and formatting. It can get more complicated as you test and try new things, maybe creating seperate scripts for specific tasks, then calling those from the bar script.

To make the status bar you must write functions that isolate system data and echo the values to a single place.

Currently I have a button mapped to a script that moves the bottom margin for tiling windows up and then unhides Onboard.   In i3, you cannot change any ""bottom margin"" for tiled windows. If Onboard is a dock window, everything will work fine out of the box. Otherwise you may have a problem here. You can, of course, always use i3-gaps and bind your button to set gaps, but that would increase the margin on all sides, not just the bottom.  The alternative is writing a small program that reserves the dock space but only opens a 1x1 window. But, well, you'd have to write it.   lso, I use lemonbar and have some clickable areas that I can touch to control some things, get info, etc.   i3 won't care about your lemonbar, it will work just fine. So no problems to be expected here."

The desktop environment itself is written in GTK2, but included in version 4.12 is the ability to render GTK3 in certain areas. (Panel plug-ins mostly.) In order to be themed entirely, it is up to theme developers to include a special stylesheet (usually located in $THEME/gtk-3.0/apps/$DE.css) that contains special styling for the XFCE desktop. As for window decorations; XFCE uses XFWM while other desktops use metacity, kwin, compiz, mutter, etc. Not many themes (usually small, underrated themes) come with an XFWM theme. The only way to fix this is use a different window theme (terrible idea since they usually wont match) or create one from scratch. (Quite easy since it's just a collection of images.)"

We can't tell you what you like or, better yet, will like, however. You will just have to try them both out (or choose one and stick with it unless you don't like it).   I have heard that i3 is more customizable and user friendly than awesomewm though.   I'm a collaborator for i3 and maintainer of the i3-gaps fork and all I can say is: more user friendly, yes (and easier to get started with), but in terms of how much it can be customized, awesome wins by a long shot. That isn't to say that i3 doesn't allow a lot of customization, too, though.   It also seems to be the most used wm here.   Of course, because it's the best window manager out there wink (just kidding, everyone has different preferences and I don't think there is a ""best"" window manager).   Here's another thing I'm worried about. Taking on another thing to learn like i3 or awesomewm might cost me, as I'm already learning bash and python.   Of course you need to learn how to use your window manager. I really don't think it's anywhere as complex as learning a programming language, however. And since learning comes best by doing, window managers have the benefit that you can't help but ""doing"". You use it every second of your uptime and you will learn the basics in no time.   So is i3 too much to learn, or?   I'd say i3 is easier to learn to start with, but with all window managers you will have some learning curve. Again, I don't think it's something to worry about, though.   Why aren't their (sic!) any guides?   Well, a lot of customization is just as individual as the desktops themselves. It just depends on what applications you run and need / want to customize etc. There are, of course, ""classics"", such as vim or whatever, and there definitely are guides on how to customize them. Maybe just not a ricing-specific place that collects all of these. As for customizing the window manager itself, a good window manager (cough i3 cough) comes with documentation, plus you can learn by looking at the dotfiles provided in the posts on this sub.  Remember that customization should also be fun. If all you want to do is download some cool-looking desktop, I think this sub is wrong for you. This is about doing your own thing (albeit you learn from others and maybe copy individual parts, especially in the beginning)."
unixporn,3drgrs,airblader,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"Thankyou for the detailed reply! It's good to get a good explanation on stuff. Sorry if I sounded a bit entitled though. I guess I'm just kind of venturing out into the world of unixporn and needed some guidance. (I love your i3 setup by the way, if I choose to pick up i3, i3-gaps is probably the way to go. It looks very aesthetic.)  One more question though. I feel like i3 would increase my productivity, as people seem to be able to effectively multitask with the way i3 handles windows. Do you feel this way also? I'm excited to use tiling window managers because watching a film, reading a pdf and having my ide open at the same time looks very fun. :)"
unixporn,3drgrs,airblader,5,Sat Jul 18 21:31:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I sounded a bit entitled though.   Don't worry, I didn't have any impression of that kind. :)   if I choose to pick up i3, i3-gaps is probably the way to go. It looks very aesthetic.   Thanks! That's what I like to hear. ;)   Do you feel this way also?   Yes, definitely. I would go crazy now if windows would overlap all the time and so on. I actually don't usually have more than 3–4 windows open on a single workspace (other people have way, way more), but even with that few windows per workspace, it's just a breeze for me to not have to worry about the overlap and placement.  But, as anything in life, it's a matter of taste. My only recommendation is: let the tiling experience sink in. Don't try to get certain things to be the way they were before because you think ""I liked it that way"". Often, it's just leftover habits and habits die hard. Embrace the tiling world for a while and then decide. Just a general piece of advice."

I think I'll read up on the i3 documentation some more and then start using it. I'll give it a week and then decide on what I like better.

It doesn't happen overnight. And there is no clear 'do it like this'. Ricing your environment is totally subject and user driven. What works for others may not work for you. You'll need to figure all this out on your own. The journey itself is better than its given credit for.     Figure out a wm to try and use it. The cool thing is that you can easily install several wm's to test. Ask yourself if you need a tiler or stacker. Then go from there. Obscure for some is perfect for others, so be aware of your options and requirements.    You can check out LinuxBBQ Cream, which has 76 window managers to test and play around with.   /u/airblader did a great job taking the time to answer your questions, and /u/z-brah 's blog will for sure shine a light on what is possible.

unixporn,3dotaz,lovelybac0n,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   This is actually done manually. GNOME has a snap-to-grid that works surprisingly well out of the box. I know there are python-tools for tiling compiz-based windows, but I am not sure whether it works for the newer versions of GNOME. I can have a look-see and report what I find :)   Edit: X-tile Does a surprisingly good job of tiling specified windows. Not sure how capable it is of keybinds, but you can set up custom tile patterns and apply them to selected windows."

If I went on someone's system & gave them my dwm setup, they wouldn't even be able to open anything, or navigate between clients.

If any nixos users want to hop down to the github repo and submit a pull request that'd be super cool.  Now, to answer some of the concerns I've seen in this comment thread.  by u/Michaelmrose   I don't think anyone in their right mind would install all of anyone's config files add to that that some might actually be sensitive.    response: A configuration made with nix-rice is not just a glob of dotfiles from your machine hastily uploaded to the internet. Personal information / things not directly related to ricing are either parametrized out of your nix-rice configuration or simply not made part of it; see this screenshot for a general idea of how it works.  by u/Trout_Tickler   [...] Just straight-up copying & pasting someone else's config is a bad idea, because you don't know how it works. [...] Plus, not everyone likes every colour scheme. [...]   response: I find this akin to saying that there should be no widely supported programming languages with unified standards, because then people would be tempted to use other people's stuff. Nix-rice is just a step away from having a dozen different config file formats and a hundred different combinations of package versions, and a step towards being able to specify exactly what you want your system to look like in a single file. That's not irresponsible power, that's just good design.  And you're not happy with the color scheme, you can change it in a single line of code ;)  by u/airblader   Ricing is about customization. This takes the entire idea and trashes it. Why not install any generic DE and just download a theme for it? At this point, that's basically what would be happening.   response: Nix-rice is not another ubuntu. If you're ever used nix / nixos, you'll know that it's all about power to the user. Don't like this version of this window manager? Add an option in your fork of nix-rice to patch its build process. Unhappy with a terminal? Change it in a single line of code, and watch as everything in your system that referred to the old terminal now refers to the new one. This isn't about taking power away, this is about making power easier to manage.  Cheers, happy ricing."

If you want to try out WM's, you might have a look at LinuxBBQ. You can test out a lot that way. My first WM was BSPWM, but currently I'm running BSPWM inside XFCE. BSPWM has okay documentation; it's not the best, but it's there. It handles it's keybindings with a separate program called SXHKD (simple X hotkey daemon), which has suited my needs well.

Now I understand that you want a no bullshit approach but in the same way, manuals become vitally important both in the customizaton of *nix as well as the administration. In both senses, it will teach you so much more about your system. Arch is a great distribution, it is one that I have stuck with, but in many ways Arch is not the be all and end all. As many others have said you can have a base system installed with Debian and achieve much the same result. As such Arch is not something you particularly need. What you will need to learn to do to be successful in the nixing world is to ""RTFM"". The man pages are written for a reason. I understand that you want to get there as easy as possible. All I am trying to say is you can't have your rice and eat it too ;).   Happy Nixing and I wish you all the best. As for a suggestion I would go with i3wm.

The main thing I've been working on is having a concept of different inputs and outputs.   The supported outputs are all terminals schemer originally output to, as well as the new feature to generate new wallpapers from the colors.  The supported inputs are images, as well as terminal configs. This is because I found it frustrating to see a colorscheme on here that I liked, but the config files would be for a different terminal. So schemer can now convert between formats. So far the supported terminal inputs are: xfce, lilyterm, terminator and termite. And I'm working on more.  I haven't uploaded it to github yet, because there's still work that needs to be done before it's ready. The command line options for it have gotten very bloated and clunky due to having more features, and I don't want to dumb it down, so I need to redesign it to be as advanced as the user wants, and simple to use otherwise."

This is to do fun stuff like make numix icons that fit my colourscheme  What you're seeing in the webm is 2 small scripts that use xgcm and prism to manage themes.

Note that you can set the colours however you like; you'll probably find a configuration that looks good to you.  I would encourage you to install a few different WMs and see what you like most. I love i3wm, and there is a reason it's so popular. You might fall in love with it too, or you might prefer something else.  Also check out XFCE for a kickass, lightweight, pretty thoroughly keyboard-controllable FWM. I loved it before I went full-time i3wm.

I don't care much for the defaults, personally, so give it a chance. Really, any WM can be pretty. One of the things I love about i3wm, though, is that it cuts the fancy, resource-hogging, slow effects. It strives to be lightweight and have things respond IMMEDIATELY to your commands, so there aren't fancy animations like shrinking windows when minimizing and wobbly windows. I reaaally like how snappy it is. Even on my 2009 netbook that struggled to run XP; honestly, that thing has been given new life with Arch+i3wm, and my Desktop with an overclocked i54670k is absolutely supersonic. There is beauty in its immediacy."

The official branch of i3 does not have gaps, but there is i3-gaps-git in the AUR which provides that, and like all over i3 config settings, is set in the .i3/config file. i3 doesn't come with an app launcher as far as I'm aware, but recommends dmenu, which appears at the top of the screen by default. Other app launchers exist of course, and will be compatible with other tiling wms.  Systray is, by default, i3-bar, but the bar also allows you to choose any program that outputs the system tray to stdout. For example, I use conky's console mode as my bar, and it appears at the right of the bar, and the workspace indicators are at the right. Other options include dzen and lemonbar (as you mentioned), but you could use anything. Alternatively, you could always forgo i3-bar completely and choose your own.  By default in i3 (assuming you choose to install the default config file on first load), you can switch between stacked/tiling windows with mod+shift+space.

unixporn,3djdcl,FacehuntersAnonymous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:58:31 2015 UTC,The whole point of tiling window managers is that it offers the ultimate flexibility in window placement   Isn't that what stacked window managers are for? I always thought tiling wms are for maximum usage of availabe space.  Edit: dat grammer.

unixporn,3dbcg9,p4p3r,2,Tue Jul 14 23:22:02 2015 UTC,Yeah. Do you know what is causing the spacing issue? I'm a newbie and I can't for the life of me figure out why it's doing that.
unixporn,3dbcg9,ComboCorrado,5,Tue Jul 14 23:24:57 2015 UTC,set the URxvt.letterSpace resource in your .Xresources or start your terminal with the -letsp option.
unixporn,3dbcg9,p4p3r,2,Tue Jul 14 23:30:06 2015 UTC,Ahh my letterspace is at -2. I'll try messing with it to see if I can get them closer together.   Edit: changing that value seems to do nothing. I'm using the font twei if that makes any difference.
unixporn,3dbcg9,SMACz42,2,Tue Jul 14 23:31:46 2015 UTC,URxvt.letterSpace: -1  Usually does it for me. In .Xdefaults or .Xresources
unixporn,3dbcg9,SMACz42,2,Wed Jul 15 00:18:08 2015 UTC,I just went through hours of a pink terminal with wierd spacing. Take a look at what xrdb does. It may be that your .Xresources isn't loading when you pull up a new terminal.  BTW I always love those flat black color schemes.
unixporn,3dbcg9,Vargman,2,Wed Jul 15 00:48:07 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure my xresources is loading because the terminal colors are working right. I think something may be overriding my xresources on the font spacing for the terminal though. It's weird because my terminal is the only place I get that weird spaced out text.
unixporn,3dbcg9,soulvice666,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:18:17 2015 UTC,"If it's urxvt, then it's controlled by the .Xresources file (capital X of course). It took me a good three hours last night, I was dealing with all of my terminal text turning pink. Yeah, not cool. But check out xrdb, that seemed to kickstart it for me.  Also, in my ~/.xinitrc file and my ~/.fluxbox/startup file was a call to xrdb that was sourcing a global file at /etc/X11/xinit/.Xresources (if it existed) before the one in the home dir.  I remember that I ran urxvt from an existing terminal to pull up a new terminal. Doing so let me see anything that was piped into sterr on the first terminal. That's how I knew which lines I needed to fix in the .Xresources file.  Did...uh...ahem, did you...er...try...well, restarting it?"
unixporn,3dbcg9,DeusVermiculus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:35:39 2015 UTC,I'll look into those. I've been messing with my ~/.Xresources file for forever trying to get it to change and have restarted it multiple times as well as reinstalling urxvt and installing a patched version from AUR. It's getting to the point where I may just switch to a different terminal emulator to get away from it.

If you were to just install one extension, install TaskBar. I have no idea how the gnome people thought being only able to see the window which you have focus on in the task bar would be a good idea.  If you get sick of gnome or ubuntu, try out linux mint with cinnamon. You will not go back. It's what I use for everything nowadays and includes all the lovely windows key shortcuts that windows has out of the box. Its also the distro I've had least amount of sound/driver/anything issues with."

I started out with (#!) Crunchbang (RIP), then Mint, then vanilla Debian and then on to Ubuntu. Pinguy OS also looks great too. I would recommend it, but if you're going to be a GNU/Linux user, you need to know your way around a command line. Sure, the Ubuntu Software Center is extremely useful, but will hinder your progress in the long haul, UNLESS you use it to quickly set up systems in a pinch (since Ninite for Linux sucks massive ass).

He finds that photos taken by Americans are too grandiose, while photos taken by Asians are much more fit for wallpapers.

Linux compatibility is pretty good (although there are certain small things i cant seem to get working). The screen is really nice (matte displays are great overall). The keyboard is also really nice (although not as good as the one on the T450s) and the trackpoint is godly.  Can't really comment on the trackpad as disabled it in the bios as soon as i got it.

I also cant get it to output 4k@60hz but that might be an issue with the integrated graphics and not Linux. Other than that I think everything else works out of the box nowadays. Initially the trackpoint buttons were giving people a hard time but support for that got added in kernel 4.0   Overall I'm happy with it though. If you need more memory I would definitely look into the T450s since you can put a 16gb dimm and have a total of 20gb. I mostly chose the X1 Carbon over the T450s due to the 1440p display.

Here's my compton start command: http://pastebin.com/P8Tk0cTD  I made all those numbers after --blur-kern like this:  python compton-convgen.py --dump-compton -f=sigma=5 gaussian 15  compton-convgen.py is a Python script that can be found here on Github.

unixporn,3cje1w,RANDOM_EXPLOSIONS,6,Wed Jul 8 11:07:48 2015 UTC,I use KDE and have had similar problems with firefox and dark themes. You can customize the colors of some fields with css but I still have problems with some sites.  More info here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox#Unreadable_input_fields_with_dark_GTK.2B_themes
unixporn,3cje1w,e7RdkjQVzw,2,Wed Jul 8 11:41:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not an Arch user but damn do they have a good wiki.  Following the instructions fixed my problems for the sites I was having problems with, I'll see if there are any other problematic websites."
unixporn,3cje1w,TLATER,2,Wed Jul 8 11:59:45 2015 UTC,"""It's not a bug, it's a feature!""   No, seriously, it's not. Firefox tries to integrate your GTK theme into the web. That obviously doesn't work because only a fraction of HTML elements use what the browser sets as standards.  The best way to fix this is to set userstyles to overwrite all default browser content. This means background color to white, input box color to white, etc. etc. That will prevent firefox from changing it with your GTK theme (which, to be fair, makes websites look uglier more often than not, even if it is a neat idea).  I use the stylish (firefox) plugin for this sort of fix. To get the right CSS style you need to edit just look at the developer tool section for the specific elements that look wrong to you, and keep the bits that look sleek. That's a lot less work, since you will just be editing CSS files for a few weeks and slowly catch everything :)"

unixporn,3cj6vp,gamecheet,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:25:50 2015 UTC,"Pulse never made sense to me, like why even use it when there's ALSA. I haven't really seen any benefits I might need that it has over ALSA, and it's just another layer that increases latency. But that's just me.  JACK is designed for pro audio work and is used for routing sounds from applications and plugging them as if it was done with real cables. And it's low latency, like ASIO if you're familiar with it.  Basically ASIO with routing on Linux. But there's JACK for Windows too.  I mostly use JACK because it just kinda makes sense, like connecting stuff, and baudline is a lot eaiser to set up, otherwise I'd have to use arecord and pipe it into baudline manually. But instead, I use baudline_jack which has JACK support and I can just plug the output of DeaDBeeF or whatever into baudline."

My conky and dzen2 setup is still kind of crazy since I just got it working today. I originally took this bar and changed a couple of things to get the look it had in my scrot. I've done a few more edits to it and now it looks like this. Right now it works with a text file (~/.conky-dzen) and a script (~/bin/scrotbar.sh). There is also this script to display the window name, but I don't use it. So the scrotbar.sh script is what you use to execute it and the .conky-dzen file specifies the information and text display, along with the colors and icons. You will notice in that file I keep mine under ~/.dzen2/icons. If you wanted to get this working on your machine, all you would need to do is change the filepaths of the icons, verify you have that font (or change it to one you have), and change the network interface to one you have (enp5s0 is my eth0).

unixporn,3c8utm,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"Section 2. 1970s of article  History of Unix:       The new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. In 1970, Peter Neumann coined the project name UNICS (UNiplexed Information and Computing Service) as a pun on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services): the new operating system was an emasculated Multics.  McIlroy attributes UNIX to Brian W. Kernighan, as well as popularizing Thompson's Unix philosophy.   When the Computing Sciences Research Center wanted to use Unix on a machine larger than the PDP-7, while another department needed a word processor, Thompson and Ritchie added text processing capabilities to Unix and received funding for a PDP-11/20.  For the first time in 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran on the PDP-11/20. A text formatting program called roff and a text editor were added. All three were written in PDP-11/20 assembly language. Bell Labs used this initial text processing system, consisting of Unix, roff, and the editor, for text processing of patent applications. Roff soon evolved into troff, the first electronic publishing program with full typesetting capability.  As the system grew in complexity and the research team wanted more users, the need for a manual grew apparent. The UNIX Programmer's Manual was published on 3 November 1971; commands were documented in the ""man page"" format that is still used, offering terse reference information about usage as well as bugs in the software, and listing the authors of programs to channel questions to them.

unixporn,3c6odw,perkited,3,Sun Jul 5 22:15:05 2015 UTC,That's generally been one of the reasons for having borders around windows. I think the gaps are basically just cosmetic because the user wants to see their wallpaper (in /r/unixporn a lot of attention seems to be paid to the wallpaper)?

Anyway, the reason for why she got booted may actually have been legit, like maybe she did something bad. That doesn't mean she's a bad person, everybody makes mistakes. But sometimes things just get messed up and the best way out is just to end it quietly and not throw every dirty detail at the hungry mob. For all I know they may be doing her a huge favour by not disclosing any details.  So my point is, nobody seems to actually know what happened but everybody seems to be eager to assume it was all Reddit's fault.  Now, I also understand that a lot of this heat is actually frustration of moderators that has accumulated over a long time and is not directly related to this particular incident. It was just a catalyst for another outcry. But since this really seems to be a big issue I think the step r/iama took today may be a great way to make reddit aware of how serious it is.

unixporn,3c12tq,Fireblasto,3,Sat Jul 4 05:01:08 2015 UTC,"It's about being responsible and mature. Because the reddit 'team' won't help you doesn't mean you have to give up as a moderator. They decided to just deal with the current situation, so that their sub will keep being as interresting as it used to be. That an extremely respectable decision, and will lead to better results than just crying and trying to 'punish' the reddit team by going dark and also punishing the community you're supposed to manage.  This was a great decision, thanks /u/foggalong. You're doing a great job here!"

unixporn,3c03jn,talking_to_strangers,17,Fri Jul 3 18:40:34 2015 UTC,I appreciate the mods for actually considering our opinion on the matter rather than going private without any warning or notice.
unixporn,3c03jn,Anyosae,12,Fri Jul 3 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"While it's completely understandable why they did given the situation, I think it's just a tad hypocritical for the mods of subreddits to implement a change which massively impacts on the users in protest of a change imposed by the admins on them without some sort of dialogue first."
unixporn,3c03jn,Anyosae,3,Fri Jul 3 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think this is kind of okay to do. This is showing them what it's like to be on the receiving end of this kind of bullshit and it's raising awareness about the crap that the admins are pulling on the mods and so far it seems to be very effective.(sorry, I'm drunk at the moment)"
unixporn,3c03jn,nktr,27,Sat Jul 4 02:21:53 2015 UTC,"While I support shutting down subreddits to protest, I don't think shutting down subreddits like this will make a difference. We are not a default sub and most of reddit wont care whether this sub is down or not, taking it down will hurt the community more than help the protest.  That being said, the decision is up to the mod team. Do you guys feel like you need to support the protest? If so go for it its your subreddit."
unixporn,3c03jn,nktr,16,Fri Jul 3 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"There was a comment in /r/DnD which I really liked. Basically, if 200 subreddits the size of us go dark (and many more have) that's just the same as a default doing it.  I'm trying to not let my personal experience influence people on this but it's pretty damn difficult. I've put forward at least 3 issues I've had with the mod tools in the past and they were all ignored without response. The communication line between the Admins and even the Default Mods is just not there."

Many subreddits have gone down and are already comming back up so you may be a bit late here for the first round of this uproar.
unixporn,3c03jn,lovelybac0n,7,Fri Jul 3 16:16:27 2015 UTC,"That post was originally made I think close to 24 hours ago. As I understand it (though as said above, this is from second hand sourced because I've been locked out of the official sub /r/modtalk for unknown reason) the talks between mods and admins have since broken down again. /r/pics tried to go back down and the admins apparently forced it back online. As far as I'm concerned we were too late for round 1, but now it's onto round 2."

unixporn,3c03jn,TheEmbernova,10,Fri Jul 3 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. Definitely yes.  At the same time, the whole reason Reddit has ended up here is because the Admins have made changes without consulting or even informing the mods.

You are the ones keeping this subreddit great by moderating and the users by submitting content. If the admins just don't care I feel it's the right thing to make a point. I don't like it but I could go without reddit for a while, especially to make your work easier. Just wanna say I support whether you blackout or not."

unixporn,3c03jn,06sharpshot,4,Fri Jul 3 18:08:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think small communities like this one should get mad about reddit drama over default subs. /r/unixporn is not a sub supposed to rely on reddit admins like /r/ama or /r/secretsanta do.  Plus, it is not the kind of sub that grabs attention of guests. Shutting it down would hurt it but probably pass as unnoticed at a reddit scale.  IMO, the only subs which have the right to protest are those who worked closely with admins to provide great content, now forced to change their organisation in a hurry.  Unless the reddit moderation tools are reaaaally bad, I think it is not very relevant to shut down this sub."

The way Reddit is being run is inexcusable and I would like to see as many subreddits support the blackout as possible. Subreddits like outoftheloop and other meta subreddits should remain open for people looking to learn about the issues but I personally feel that unixporn should go dark as a show of support.  Edit: There are also plenty of ways to protest as an individual. Things I have done are to enable ad blocking in Reddit, abstain from buying gold, and to delete all my alt accounts and all my old posts from my account to limit the search engine hits given to Reddit. By denying Reddit ad revenue and limiting how much they show up on Google, you send a strong message. Companies notice declining profits."

unixporn,3bv3rv,vesche,14,Thu Jul 2 12:36:19 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, as /u/bstamour pointed out I fell into the trap of not-testing-well-enough. I used ""Hello World"" when I tested my codez which allowed my strupper function to DECEIVE me. In retrospect this should have been quite obvious given the nature of post-fix incrementing. Anyway, it's fixed now- sadly no longer 1 or 2 lines which makes it like at least 3x as uncool.  Hey OP, nice c0dez you got going on there (school assignment?). I'm bored at work so I decided to change some of it to make it more compact. I think with these simple functions it makes it more readable but you do need to know a bit about pointers and such..   Some people will disagree with my suggestions, which is fine- I'm not saying this is the best way to write this stuff it's just a different way.   1: Your str upper function can be written as such:  void strupper(char *str) {     while (*str) {         *str = (*str >= 'a' && *str <= 'z') ? (*str) - ' ' : *str;         ++str;     } }   A couple of choices were made here...    You were using a variable to index the string, this isn't really needed. str[i] is the same thing as *(str + i), since the while loop will terminate on '\0' we can use *str to loop through a whole string (incrementing the pointer as the last thing in the block). Keep in mind you must have '\0' at the end..(isn't C crazy?)  I compacted your if stuff down to a ternary statement, basically if the condition is true it will return the left side of ':' otherwise the right side. In this case I'm comparing with 'a' and 'z' instead of decimal or hex values because it's a bit easier to read. I used (*str) - ' ' because the space character is dec 32 or hex 20 (you were using dec 32). If the value is not a lower case letter (uppercase or other) just keep it the same.    2: Your strcpy function. Mine is:  void mstrcpy(char *dest, const char *src) {     do {         *dest = *src;     } while (*dest++, *src++); }    I marked the source string as const because we aren't modifying it.  The do-while loop might not behave nicely with bad pointers (haven't tried it) but for this it shouldn't matter too much. You could add a simple check at the top to avoid null stuff..just be aware that it might be a problem.  The do-while loop itself is super simple..assign the value at dest to the value at src, the while part will keep going and increment dest and src until src is '\0'. This part is a bit weird because we're exploiting the infrequently used comma operator..the *dest++ part will be executed and have its' result discarded- then *src++ will be executed and have it's result returned- this acts as the test for the while loop. (The comma operator will execute a series of things but only return the result of the last one).    3: Your delete newline function. Mine is:  void del_nl(char *str) {     while (*str) {         *str = (*str == '\n') ? ' ' : *str;         ++str;     } }    You're loop only goes to 100. Pretty restrictive, much easier to do the test for '\0' on str.  I chose to replace the newline character with a space, if we replace it with '\0' this will mess up probably every single other string function down the line. Replacing with '\0' is a pretty terrible idea. If I have ""Hello\nThere!\n"" and call del_nl (replacing with '\0') on it and then try to print the string it will only print ""Hello"". (If you really want to pull your hair out replace newlines with '\0' write the raw bytes to a file and then try getting back your full text..=P)    That's all I'm gonna talk about for now..thanks for distracting me for a bit lol.

The term is often defined as offensive or racist stereotyping.    In some cases users of the term assert that it is not offensive or racist,   or else treat the term as a humorous, mild put-down rather than a racial slur.

Also, where are your address bar and bookmarks bar?  I was thinking of switching to pentadactyl; I wonder if this would play well with it.  Also, a little tip that you may find useful: tab groups, although I thought they were silly at first, can be very useful for keeping your different projects organised. I've just started using them, and with the keyboard shortcuts, they're pretty much a game changer. Note that your pinned tabs (you can add a keyboard shortcut to that!) stay in the same tiny place across all tab groups (good for things you check often, so you can Ctrl/Alt +1-9 to them).   It's the difference between   having a box of socks, a box of fruit, a box of sand and a box of kittens.   and   having a big box full of socks, fruit, sand and kittens.   I really like your dark grey theme! The common ~ #333333 isn't really my bag, but the #181818 you've got is more my style. I'm running #121212 right now, and it's great!"

Ctrl + ` again brings me to the next group ""Vim!"" (also lernding dis!) Ctrl + Shift + E (or the little button in the top right corner) shows me all of the groups and tabs; very mouse-friendly. I can also just start typing to search through all of my tabs and they will highlight dynamically as the search narrows. Press enter to navigate to the first highlighted tab.

Also, not very good answer at 3.

Cool thing about i3 is that you can switch workspaces with the mousewheel when the pointer is hovering anywhere on the i3bar, so I blindly flip the pointer to the top edge of the screen then wheel my way to the workspace I'm going to.

Here's my reasoning:  Imagine that instead of IRC, it was named blabber. Saying ""blabber chats"" would be completely acceptable. Well, I view IRC the same way. It's just a name. I'm not using it as a shorthand for Internet Relay Chat. I'm using it as one single name, IRC. The fact that the characters stand for something is nothing but an implementation detail.  This has the advantage of making life a lot easier. You will at times have to use words which are technically abbreviations of other words, without knowing what it's an abbreviation of. It wouldn't really be very practical to have to know what the letters in an abbreviation stands for before you can use the word."

unixporn,3blbst,DiesIstNichtEnglisch,6,Tue Jun 30 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"awesome and xmonad are both dynamic tiling window managers, based on dwm. They are very different than tmux because their purpose is to avoid manual window placement/configuration as much as possible.  What you're looking for is a manual tiling window manager. ratpoison is based on GNU screen, another multiplexer like tmux, and is exactly what you're looking for because it was made specifically to be an X-based analogue to screen. It supports multiple workspaces but only uses one by default. Window and workspace management is handled through a command line (a literal command line, like tmux's C-b :), and commands can be bound to keys, much like tmux. If you want to try this one out, prepare to do a lot of reading. Other manual TWMs of note are HerbstluftWM and subtle, two of the more popular WMs on this subreddit; and StumpWM, which is based on ratpoison and is more extensible, but is significantly larger and more complex due to being written in Lisp."

Roomy Bookmarks Toolbar is really handy for saving space; I use folders within the bookmarks bar as dropdown menus to organize my bookmarks (it works very well, and is equally keyboard and mouse friendly!)  I use Stylish very often, and tend to use customized dark themes on most sites I use often. Color That Site! is really handy for recolouring sites (although there's a learning curce, and it's a little difficult to control).  It is with Color That Site! that I achieved the Reddit theme you see here -- It took about an hour of fiddling around to get it like this (I wish there was a colour picker and a hex value input, but it works I suppose).

unixporn,3bjnom,airblader,5,Mon Jun 29 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"Using i3bar and conky, there are two things you should know. First off, turn your conky output into a single physical line. You can do this by appending \ to the end of each line (except the last). It should look like this. If you use an old version of i3(bar), this will actually fix the flickering. The latest versions shouldn't have the flickering anymore anyway, but it's sitll a bit more efficient to do this.  The other thing to look out for is setting a buffer size for conky (e.g., text_buffer_size 1000). This is only relevant if your JSON output is really long and you find your statusline crashing.  However, in general I can only agree with /u/-Pelvis-… I'd recommend something other than conky for i3bar. My vote also goes to i3blocks, it's a great tool."

unixporn,3bjnom,-Pelvis-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"System tray is something the application has to support, you cannot feed data in it or something to get it to work. AFAIK lemonbar doesn't support that. Getting workspaces to work depends on the wm, so you should settle for one before getting that to work. Many window managers support EWMH hints that can be used, but i3 for example does not (but you can use the IPC there)."

Wireless will almost certainly be an issue for you, depending on your machine's age all post 2011 machines use Broadcom wireless, so you'll have to use their blob for that.

Shouldn't be that hard to do...  Just run a ps -ef, see if it's running, grab the pid and kill it if it is, otherwise run i3bar in the background  On the hotkey part, make a script that runs on $mod in your i3 config file, if it hears $mod again in n milliseconds, do that thing that I describe above  (i'm not too good with shell scripting syntax wise, please forgive)"

unixporn,3bd3df,ar-nelson,7,Sun Jun 28 02:05:31 2015 UTC,Funny. I was toying with the idea of writing a window manager and this was exactly one of the features I was thinking of.
unixporn,3bd3df,airblader,3,Sun Jun 28 08:31:12 2015 UTC,"Mh, couldn't you just do something like focused=> no title bar, resize as needed; unfocused (or whatever) => titlebar+resize window $titlebar_height?  Don't know what i3 allows to do with clients, can be easily done with fvwm(no tiling by default) and I'm pretty sure awesome could do it, too."
unixporn,3bd3df,le_avx,4,Sun Jun 28 11:39:05 2015 UTC,"This is possible in i3, yes. And using a bindsym, you could make this toggle via clicks on titlebars and the like.  Sort of the biggest problems are:   You have to memorize the original geometry of the window for when you restore it. Clients can resize themselves at any given point in time, which either breaks this or requires even more effort. You never know how clients will react to being resized to essentially zero height. It'd be a problem of the client, if it even happens, but still.   A window manager doing this as a feature would probably just unmap the client window as opposed to resizing it."
unixporn,3bd3df,airblader,2,Sun Jun 28 11:45:49 2015 UTC,This would be cool.
unixporn,3bd3df,a5de0644-59be-4338-a,2,Sun Jun 28 02:48:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe take a look at qtile. It's written in python, so it should be pretty hackable."
unixporn,3bd3df,wormholer,5,Sun Jun 28 02:52:55 2015 UTC,"Let's be straight, here: this is all about gaps, isn't it? The stacked layout in i3 is exactly what you're asking for---it just doesn't have gaps."
unixporn,3bd3df,ANOKNUSA,5,Sun Jun 28 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"The stacked layout in i3 is not the same as this. With a stacked layout, I have to choose which one I want to see. With the collapsing feature, the windows are independent of another."
unixporn,3bd3df,airblader,-6,Sun Jun 28 11:39:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, i3 doesn't do what you want in the exact way you want. That's a failure on the user's part to learn and adapt. Figure out how to judiciously manage containers, windows and marks instead of writing something entirely new just to turn a substantial chunk of the screen into a dumping ground. That's precisely the sort of pointless shit solved by taskbars, docks and system trays 20 years ago. There's a logical reason why we ""iconify"" windows nowadays rather than ""boxify"" them, and the idea that titlebars are a useless unless they're serving no purpose and wasting space is, quite frankly, nonsense."

unixporn,3bd3df,ANOKNUSA,3,Tue Jun 30 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"There are some cases where ""learn and adapt"" to what's already there is the best response. Especially in development, because of rampant NIH syndrome. But the point of this sub is customization, and if an existing WM can't make my customization idea work without compromises, writing something new seems like a valid response.  I've used tiling WMs that let you completely hide windows when you're not using them. It's too easy to forget what's there, especially when you step away and come back. Stacking titlebars seems like a more tiling-WM-friendly alternative to a taskbar or dock, but including the titlebar even when a window is open is a waste of space, and I like the look of titlebar-less terminal windows.  Of course, yes, gaps are a waste of space too. Sometimes wasted space makes things more readable, or aesthetically appealing, and everyone has their own opinion on aesthetics. Making your system look good is, after all, the point of this sub."
unixporn,3bd3df,ANOKNUSA,0,Sun Jun 28 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how having visible titlebars on windows that are in use is a waste of space. Having a stack of boxes floating in the middle of the workspace, representing windows that are not in use--that's a waste of space. The former is an interface component that serves a clearly defined function; the latter, a constant reminder of something you really, really should not be forgetting anyway. A good carpenter doesn't hammer in a bunch of nails half-way, then invent a snazzy new hammer with a nail counter in it as a reminder of how many nails need to be hammered in the rest of the way. That's what a bad carpenter would do. A good carpenter simply hammers in nails when and where they're needed, and pays careful attention to the tasks at hand.  I don't know what WM you used that let's you make windows completely disappear, but i3 ain't one of them. (Note that while the scratchpad is capable of holding multiple windows, it most certainly is not intended to.) There's always some indicator of what's open, be it the visible windows themselves, the titlebars, the workspace list, or the system tray. Everything you need is right there. If you forget to check all of those things, the fault most certainly does not lie with the window manager. Inventing a snazzy new gadget to avoid the ""inconvenience"" of eliminating bad habits is a waste of time."

unixporn,3bd3df,airblader,2,Sun Jun 28 02:10:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely would like such a feature and here is one example why: For work, I have to start virtual machines. However, they are just servers running in the background, so I don't need to ""see"" them.  In i3, I could send them into the scratchpad, but that hides them completely and I run the risk of forgetting to shut the VM down, which in my case will cost me two hours to set it back up because it breaks the machine.  Hence, having a minimized version would save me the screen space, but remind me that it's there. The VM stuff is already on its own workspace and I don't necessarily want to open another ""trash"" workspace just for that.  But as /u/ar-nelson said, everyone has their own workflows."
unixporn,3bd3df,actionless,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:42:09 2015 UTC,"That's a good point; everyone has a different workflow, though, and I used wmii (over other tiling WMs) for a while specifically because I liked its window stacking behavior, because it was common for me to end up with a lot of extra windows (terminals, file managers) that I would keep around but not want cluttering the screen."

unixporn,3b89wl,clearvanity,45,Fri Jun 26 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"that's a super general question.  as far a ricing (looking ""pretty"") goes, you can rice any distro. it's all about setting up the applications you want and configuring them. the first, and biggest, step is deciding which environment to use. full blown desktop (DE) or just a simple window manager (WM). both have pros and cons, but many (not all) the setups you see here are just a wm. i suggest to everyone who asks this to try the linuxbbq cream live iso. it's got 76 different window managers pre-installed so you can try out lots of them and see what you like.  the distro question on the other hand is much harder to answer. there are a great number of them, and many are variants of the same base, each with different goals and methods of doing things. i guess my best suggestion is to visit distrowatch and read up. i'm a distrohopper. i try out lots of them and change my setup when i see something new i want to try out. i don't understand fanatical devotion to one or another. at their core they're similar in many ways. just pick one and dive in. for me, the best way to learn is to do. lots of people will suggest you start with a simple system to get and get your feet wet, while others will tell you to try something more challenging and learn a lot very quickly. it's all about how you want to learn."

I started with Manjaro, but jumped ship and switched to Arch after less than a week since Manjaro didn't provide me with the experience I wanted. As someone who had no beforehand experience whatsoever with GNU/Linux, Arch really wasn't that hard to get up and running. Believe me though, it will take hours of tinkering at first. A huge upside is that the wiki is super extensive- if you have any issue at all, you know it's answered somewhere in there. The only thing that might be trouble at first is installing it, but there are hundreds of tutorials online that will walk you through step by step if you don't know what you're doing. In my opinion, turning on your computer and feeling like you really have complete control is a fantastic feeling that's worth the initial effort.  That being said, if you're really unsure, try any distros you're interested in with a virtual machine!"
unixporn,3b89wl,gl3nnleblanc,3,Sat Jun 27 00:11:20 2015 UTC,I would second this. You can't find better documentation.

unixporn,3b89wl,AJGatherer,8,Tue Jun 30 19:27:06 2015 UTC,"I recommend trying out a mainstream Debian based distribution since that will minimize the learning curve and have you up and running with the typical applications that you might need quickly. Consider this your ""daily driver.""  Then, install virtualbox and go ahead and try the more customizable distros (Arch etc. )in a virtual environment. You can still learn about the guts without worrying that you might make a mistake and not be able to do x on your daily driver until you figure it out."

unixporn,3b89wl,Jimmyleith,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"Hello Op , I'm pretty much in the same situation. I'm choosing to install arch on as a Vm until I am comfortable enough to wipe my Windows OS. I will also mention thay arch has somewhat preconfigured packages that come with gui already configured. Just so you don't fire it up and end up looking down the end of a command line."
unixporn,3b89wl,everydaylinuxuser,11,Sat Jun 27 09:42:04 2015 UTC,There are two ways of doing this.  You can either go for broke and start out with something like Linux From Scratch or Arch or a similar distro which encourages learning but you may find that the slow burn and longer learning curve will curb your enthusiasm.  The alternative is to learn each part of Linux bit by bit. Distributions like Xubuntu and Lubuntu are great for pimping. They aren't bloated with software and they use desktops that are built for customisation.  This guide will get you started on the road to customising Xubuntu. (http://linux.about.com/od/howtos/ss/Customise-The-XFCE-Desktop-Environment.htm)  I have also been working on a guide for Bodhi Linux recently and I have started writing guides for customising Enlightenment. It isn't the most popular desktop but it has loads of customisable features.  (http://linux.about.com/od/howtos/fl/Customise-The-Enlightenment-Desktop-Part-3-Screens.htm)  My advice would be to start with something easy. Get as much out of it as you can and then move on to something with a longer learning curve.
unixporn,3b89wl,nihlius,8,Fri Jun 26 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"I second the notion of diving into Arch. I started off with Ubuntu for LAMP and whatnot, but I only started learning about it for real when I went cold turkey and installed Arch on a laptop and went from there. Best thing I did for learning the ins and outs of Unix stuffs."
unixporn,3b89wl,TLATER,10,Fri Jun 26 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's generally the best idea. If you start up a computer without a GUI for the first time (many people do so nowadays) and have never seen a terminal before it will just confuse you, and you will simply brainlessly follow the guide hoping you don't mistype a character. That's not learning IMO.  Many people also feel overwhelmed when they first work with Linux, knowing it is ""for geeks"". Installing something with Arch's reputation could just be overkill. Seeing a neatly prepared desktop as you're used to can help in doing away with stereotypes and sparking more interest, and it will introduce you to a few new concepts (package managers? root? uefi? grub? wtf is that?).  Remember how difficult it was to figure out what you had to do to the BIOS to even boot Linux (if your first was before that imagine the scenario) the very first time, do you want to tell me you could have installed Arch straight after as a non-developer? ;p  Knowing OP is a developer I do think they can go with arch, but it's highly subjective. I would never generally recommend this, even if the learning curve is probably the most optimal."

The thing is that it actually does a pretty good job of telling you WHY you are inputting the commands, and what they accomplish.  I had only touched Ubuntu before. After installing arch I never want to go back. My systems are lean and default until I decide to change them. The thing with doing stuff yourself is that you always have some idea of what you did wrong, so you have a starting point to fixing it."

unixporn,3b89wl,aurorafluxic,11,Sat Jun 27 10:54:27 2015 UTC,"For the sake of having a stable underlying system, I would absolutely start with Ubuntu first. There is still much customizing you can do with it. Start by learning how to use custom GTK styles, custom icons, custom fonts. Experiment with things like Conky, and slowly go from there.   You can still know the ins and outs of Ubuntu, and it's where I'd begin. Once you become comfortable with the command line and tweaking themes and playing with icons and such, then you should (inside Ubuntu itself) start experimenting with i3wm. It's the easiest to install and with an Ubuntu base, you can have Unity (stock Ubuntu DE) as a seperate session than i3, so if shit hits the fan, you always have a way out.   This is where we all start. You've got a pretty interesting and entertaining world in front of you.   Good luck!"
unixporn,3b89wl,Dr_Chroot,2,Fri Jun 26 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"Upvoted! Fantastic advice for a newbie. Ubuntu, despite all of Canonical's baggage, is still a great place to start. Also, the i3 page on the ArchWiki was fantastic for me, even when I was installing it on Ubuntu 12.04 ;D"

I love the unixporn screenshots I see, but have no idea how to go about emulating them or even where to start.  I've been using Linux Mint 17 (Cinnamon) for some time now I know I'm sticking with Linux, and know what knowledge I do have and what I'm going to ask for help on.  I just recently installed i3wm (typing from it now, actually) and I can really appreciate how fast and lean it is, but definitely miss a few small quirks from Cinnamon (like, typing 'disk' in the menu lets me select Disk Usage Analyzer, not having to memorize all the program names for each program, etc.)  I'm also doing what most of the commentors have suggested and installing Arch, but doing so first in a VM so I understand the process before installing it on a spare PC to tinker with.  Seems like fun so far, and having full control over packages will be both overwhelming and liberating at the same time.  Good luck OP!  I'd love to hear your progress or what you decide."

It's a rather important piece of software!):  # move windows around super + {left,down,up,right}       wmv {-20 0, 0 20, 0 -20, 20, 0} $(pfw)  # resize windows super + alt + {left,down,up,right}       wrs {-20 0, 0 20, 0 -20, 20, 0} $(pfw)   That's for tools that can be bound ""directly"" via sxhkd. For more complex tasks, I use a few scripts of my own:   vroum - manage window focus groaw - manage window groups focus - finer way to focus windows corner - move windows to screen's corner fullscreen - put a window in fullscreen mode   vroum  It can take 3 arguments: ""next, prev, $wid"". ""next"" will focus the next window on the stack, previous will focus the previously focused window, and every argument starting by 0x will be considered a window ID to be focused directly. It will also change the border of all the inactive windows, and the active window. I use this script to cycle between them:  # cycle through windows alt {, + shift} + tab     vroum {next, prev}   groaw  This is my ""group"" manager (think of it as workspaces on steroid). By default, new windows are not assigned any groups. Without much explaning how each flag works, I just need it to perform 3 tasks:   add the current window to a specific group toggle visibility state of a specific group remove current window from all groups   This result in the following entries:  # add window to a group super + shift + {1,2,3,4,5}     groaw -d all; \     groaw -a {1,2,3,4,5}  # toggle groups' visibility super + {1,2,3,4,5}     groaw -t {1,2,3,4,5}  # remove window from all groups super + Backspace     groaw -d all   focus  A script I'm really proud of! It focus windows besed on their cardinal positions. It takes exactly 4 different arguments:          north           ^           |  west <---+---> east           |           v         south   It will then focus the nearest window in the given direction (using top/left edge of the window) It's bound like so  # select windows using directions alt + {left,down,up,right}       focus {west, south, north, east} $(pfw)   corner  There's nothing special about it. It put the window in the corner passed as argument (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right, MiDdle)  # move windows to corners super + {y,u,b,n,g}     corner {tl, tr, bl, br, md} $(pfw)   fullscreen  Set a window in fullscreen mode (change its size to the size of the monitor, and remove borders. The previous position/size of the window is saved to a file, so when you disable fullscreen mode, or move another window in fullscreen, the window takes its old position back  # set window fullscreen super + x     fullscreen $(pfw)   DEALING WITH EVENTS  The above only applies to existing windows. But when a new window gets created, I need to run a few commands against it, to integrate it to my workflow. This is what wew is for. It prints X events to stdout, and the window ID the event applies to. For example:  16:0x000c00ea 19:0x000c00ea   Event number 16 is ""window creation"", 19 is ""mapping request"". I have a parser script that will perform different actions depending on the fired event (it's called yawee, I like weird names):  #!/bin/sh  while IFS=: read ev wid; do     case $ev in         # window creation: center window on the screen (except docks, menus or similar)         16) wattr o $wid || corner md $wid ;;          # mapping requests: just set a special border for docks, menus and         # similar. Focus other windows         19) wattr o $wid \             && chwb -s 2 -c 0x323232 $wid \             || vroum $wid ;;          # when a window gets deleted, focus another one         18) wattr $(pfw) || vroum prev 2>/dev/null;;          # Focus windows when the mouse cursor enter them         7) wattr o $wid || vroum $wid ;;     esac done   In my $HOME/.xinitrc, it's started as:  wew | yawee &   Pretty straighforward :)  USING THE MOUSE  Nobody's perfect. I use the mouse from time to time to manage my windows. It is sometimes more efficient to get a window out of your way quickly, or resize one approximatively.  For this purpose, I STILL use sxhkd! Baskerville did an amazing job with this software, as it support integer replacement of the mouse coordinate  # move windows with the mouse: super + !button{1,3}     {wmv, wrs} -a %i %i $(pfw)   As simple as that!  MISCELLANOUS  For eye candy purpose, I wrote a pulsar script, to make my currently active window standout. It make the window's border ""pulse"" like in the following video: http://raw.z3bra.org/dev/random/wall-border.webm. It uses a $HOME/.colors file containing the colors to be used for the gradient. It will then run chwb at a regular interval to change the current window's borders.  That's pretty much it! If you have any question, do not hesitate to ask. Also, sorry for the huge wall of text, I was trying to be as precise as possible.  As a bonus, to congratulate you from reading it all, here is a video from my actual workflow with this setup (writing my latest blogpost: http://raw.z3bra.org/dev/random/monochromatic-0x0017-writeup.webm (grab some popcorns, it's 57 minutes long)"

Yes, they work completely fine but you might want to setup a way to quickly launch a program. As an example i3 by default comes with dmenu, which, when called via a keyboard hotkey, gives you an input bar on top of your screen with autocompletion for the apps on your computer. There are also menu apps available where you can store your most used applications, two examples of which can be seen on the right side of this screenshot.  I personally am on ubuntu and installed i3 over unity, and most of the graphical apps that came with unity (nautilus file browser, firefox, gnome-terminal etc.) work fine under i3 (and can be launched with the above methods). So I did not have to install (many) new things, which is great.  Generally, you want applications that cope well with being resized, especially in a tiling wm environment, since these window managers resize windows all the time to fill out the screen. Libreoffice impress (powerpoint) for example is a bit dorky when shrunk horizontally, as it has these vertical toolbars with the slides list and whatnot on each side."

Gnome, KDE, Mate, XFCE4... all include a WM among all the apps and services they bundle. They are usually used only inside these WMs, and thus are less well-known.  It's true most minimalistic tiling WM don't have window controls. A lot of window managers do, like Openbox, which is actually quite light and minimalistic but not tiling. Any DE includes a WM. Gnome's window decorations come from its window manager, it just is less well known because most people don't use it outside a DE.  A good example would be LXDE, which uses Openbox as its WM; openbox is also very commonly used ""on its own"", not as part of any stablished DE. You could swap it; I've used XFWM4 (XFCE's WM) on LXDE, and Awesome on Gnome.  I might be nitpicking and you may know all this already, but may be it makes it more clear for someone who doesn't."

Seems you've fallen into the presumption that trends (or any change over time) represent meaningful progress. This is false. Best to do away with that notion now. Trends change because people enjoy novelty, and trends get promoted because that novelty generates publicity and revenue. That's all there is to that.  Most people who use minimal window managers do so for two reasons:   They're usually focused on the efficiency of the interface, not how sparkly it is. They allow the user to craft the working environment they want from the components they want, rather than installing a gigabyte of shit no one person will ever find useful.   Sure, there's an aesthetic component to it--minimizing distractions and such--and there will always be people who jump on whatever seems to be popular in their little group at the moment. But mainly it's because stand-alone window managers allow for substantially more flexibility."

unixporn,3b2au2,SoftwareAlchemist,3,Tue Jun 30 18:26:42 2015 UTC,IMHO they make a setup look antiquated....right out of 1995. I ask here because I see so many posted here. I guess the full DE is just not trendy at the moment?   A DE consists of    background daemons that perform various services  a set of consistent applications that handle common tasks  gui tools to configure various things about your system  a window manager  set of gui elements/apps to facilitate interaction with your computer including  a panel a desktop  window decorations a set of applets that run in panel/desktop  some sort of overview of virtual desktops / running apps an app/file launcher   While synonymous with a full de almost all of that can also be had with a tiling wm so let's talk about the diffences   The panel is more basic but can incorporate output of arbitrary commands easily. We can't easily embed applets in it but functionality can be replaced by binding commands to keybindings. This is more powerful than you might imagine combined with scripting.   Decorations are more basic or nonexistent and your close button is replaced with a shortcut minimize has no meaning in a tiling wm where most apps are visible all the time and instead of minimizing apps you arrange them on multiple workspaces or tabs or have them arranged automatically.   The desktop as a means to organize files and apps is gone but it was always a crummy metaphor and applets running there are hidden 99% of the time.   No overview but then if you have 2-10 workspaces with 3-12 windows arrangements automatically according to your wishes this is less necessary.   Basically what is replaced is mostly fluff what is added is a variety of functionality and workflows not possible in a de.  It's not about trendy or even entirely about minimalism I ran kde before i3wm and still use some of its apps.   It's not about having less features or more features it's about having the right ones for your workflow.

I also only use Ratpoison for its' shortcuts, because I only ever have a single terminal window occupying the whole screen.  If I need more applications, that's what tmux is for; and if I outgrow that, I can open other terms and use RP's shortcuts to flip between them.  http://freecode.com/articles/the-antidesktop  This is similar to my default setup, but it's truthfully a bit better.

Actually I've been using OS X for a few years. Now I finally have a Linux laptop again, since last week.  I got the Dell XPS 13 with Ubuntu preinstalled. I was mildly optimistic about that. Well, it mostly worked... But the preconfigured GNOME environment terrified me. There were Amazon ads; the application launcher was slow as molasses; everything was horrible.  A few days of messing around, and now I've replaced everything with NixOS and Ratpoison. For a while I was using just ttys, but even the largest possible console font is too small for HiDPI, and X comes in handy, since the current web requires graphics...  I find myself yearning for console clients for all the websites I use. Or Emacs modes. Even thinking about crazy ideas like mirroring subreddits to git repositories...  I grew up with Linux, Ratpoison, and Emacs. It's so good to be back! Cheers for the console. Keep the dream alive. Computers don't have to be slow, patronizing, and annoying.

Almost synchronistic in fact, given that recently I've been learning about functional programming and logic gates, and writing my own loops in bash, (using test) which more closely mirror loops in assembly, and seem to be a bit faster as a result, not to mention easier for me to understand."
unixporn,3b2au2,Thimoteus,2,Sun Jun 28 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"There are many possible reasons. I'll explain some of the more popular reasons.  A common one is performance. As explained by others, a DE will most likely consume a lot more resources than a WM-only setup. This can be important if you are with a laptop (battery life!), low-end hardware or do generally care about resource consumption.  Another important factor is that most DEs come with many applications and features pre-installed and also usually dictate a certain workflow that many users will eventually come to dislike. Of course you can deinstall software and most DEs will allow you to tweak and alter lots of their features and behaviour, but if you feel like you have to remove and adjust more than what you are actually going to use, it might be a better solution to just start out with a minimal but highly customisable setup and only add what you actually want. This is often where the WM-only approach comes in.  Let me give you some examples from my own experience that you might be able to identify with:   I always found myself cluttering the desktop with shortcuts, files and folders until it was a mess. Then I would create a ""desktop"" folder, throw everything inside and start again. Not a good idea. Eventually I ended up deactivating desktop icons in my DEs to prevent this. Overlapping windows started to annoy me, so did entirely hidden or minimised windows that I found myself searching for from time to time. Alt-Tab also didn't seem as an appropriate solution, as I would often switch to the wrong application and start all over again. Eventually I ended up organising all my windows like tiles and try to just keep them this way. My right wrist started to hurt a lot from using the mouse, so I tried using the keyboard as much as possible. I eventually ended up tweaking my DE for keyboard use as much as possible, but the results are not always satisfying. I only use a handful of programs on a regular basis and I know their names. Since I try to avoid the mouse, I ended up using SUPER+R (Windows) or SUPER (Ubuntu/Debian) to bring up a dialog that allows me to start a program by typing its name. However, in Ubuntu, for example, this is often laggy due to the fancy looks and irrelevant stuff being displayed in addition. Also, this makes all the menus (""Start Menu"") useless. Eventually I ended up installing dmenu to have a quick and efficient way of opening applications.   If you find yourself in a situation like this, you might find it a lot more convenient to just start with a WM-only setup, install the bits and pieces you really need, customise for a while (usually longer than tweaking a DE via its GUI menus) and end up with a setup that lets you work comfortably and efficiently. At this point, you might like it so much that you really couldn't care less about the looks of your desktop. That said, personally I think that especially the tiling WM setups can look not only a lot better but also a lot cooler than regular DEs."
unixporn,3b2au2,mudfly,2,Fri Jun 26 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"The idea that DEs and standalone WMs are somehow these distinct categories is weird to me. The term “DE” is probably bad. I use bspwm, lemonbar, sxhkd and a dozen scripts. I have a DE. I've built it myself instead of using one that exists, but it's still a desktop environment.  I also completely don't uderstand the idea that a desktop must — for some reason — look “modern”. Does my setup look like something out of 1995? Kinda. In places. What of it? How is that a problem? Old != bad. Trends are meaningless; I care about what I personally find aesthetically pleasing instead of listening to what The GNOME Foundation tells you your desktop should look and feel like.  Looking at the way you've asked the question, I doubt you actually want a honest answer, but I'll bite: I use a custom environment built around simple building blocks because that's how I like my systems to operate. It's not just the desktop environment either, my whole system is built to be transparent, easy to set up, customize and debug. Your KDEs and GNOMEs are built to hide the system behind a wall of complexity in the form of fancy buttons. I don't want that."

Then i use tint2 to show iconified windows, lemonbar to show system status and compton. Now in 30 min i think i can get the setup i want editing files (not rewriting them every time).

unixporn,3b2au2,elpfen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"I personally use XFCE and can get it the way I like it in about 10 min.   ""The way I like it"" is a bit ambiguous (if that’s the right term). A (scriptable) wm gives you many more possibilities of configuration and lets you do things that mostly couldn’t be possible in a DE. So someone who knows what they can do with a wm will see much more of these possibilities, and will (if they can be bothered) configure it more, which is gonna take longer but will result in a better experience and saved time in the long run. With great power come great amounts of configuring stuff.  A practical example: I am currently writing my bsc thesis. For that, I have a folder full of papers in pdf form (about 20) and another folder of markdown text files, one for each pdf file (which I use to summarize the papers). I could now, with the help of bash and my wm (i3), set it up so that, upon pressing a single keyboard shortcut,    my pdf reader opens all of the pdf files in seperate windows my wm opens terminal windows with instances of vim, having all the 'notes' text files open in seperate windows have my wm arrange these windows in a way that I have a bunch of tabs on one workspace, and in each tab there’s a pdf file and its corresponding text file opened next to each other.   Let's say I am relatively fluent in bash (needed for finding the folder with the files and associating pdf and text files with each other) and know the commands that can be sent to i3 via bash. Then I could probably come up with a script that does the above in like 20-30 minutes. If I want to open all my pdf and notes files once every day to start working on stuff, that time investment would return itself after like 5 or 6 days, since it takes at least 3 minutes to open all the files and arrange the windows manually, which also is an incredible chore. Writing a script is great fun by comparison and good practice. And it can easily be extended, e.g. I could also open all my LateX files (which I write the thesis in) on a different workspace.    In terms of a more general setup, it depends. I installed i3 over unity which already came with a bunch of applications like tray network and keyboard managers that work in the i3 environment. i3 itself comes with a decent default configuration and if you know how to use it, setting it up with the default settings is trivial thanks to package managers. The more you stray away from the default configuration tho, the longer it takes to setup.  Additionally, if you have to learn how to use* and configure it, the time it takes can easily explode into multiple hours. But not at once, it's rather a case of constantly upgrading things.  * Which, coming to a new environment, you do have to do in order to use a wm-only-setup as opposed to a DE which is almost self-explanatory by design."

unixporn,3b0sdm,gpyh,5,Thu Jun 25 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion: this would be a great experience learning a bit about image editing.  Fire off Gimp and look for a simple tutorial. This kind of wallpaper is not hard to make. Find the logo and put it on a layer. On the background layer, just create some texture with a filter. The middle layers will have transparency and you'll use them to adjust color and light.  In a 2-hour session maximum you would have your wallpaper and learned a cool skill."
unixporn,3b0sdm,nejni-marji,3,Thu Jun 25 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"I agree and regardless of whether someone is willing to fulfill this request, I will definitely learn the basics of Gimp to accomplish this eventually. At the moment it is lower down on my priority list because there is just so much to learn as a new Linux user (especially for an Arch user) and I have a list of Arch Wiki entries to read and apply to my Arch system. This wallpaper thing is just something extra to make my system more eye-appealing--I am working on configuring the essentials to my system in the meantime (I just started learning Linux 2 weeks ago =))."

You can find an example .xinitrc at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- modify it to suit your needs.

unixporn,3auace,z-brah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"Just tried this and it didn't work. Also made sure that compton was running just fine, like /u/airblader suggested and that didn't do anything either. I tried what /u/__pirateer__ said as well and added a %{c} tag and surrounded it with color tags setting both the foreground and background to the BACKGROUND color, but to no avail. I'll take a look at other scripts on the sub to see if I can find a difference.   EDIT: When I say it didn't work, I mean it works for a second (the time the script sleeps), and then fills in the middle with the dark blue color, so I don't know what is causing that change."
unixporn,3auace,Saser,2,Tue Jun 23 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"The -B and -F flags specify a default background/foreground for lemonbar, which you can use in your formatting by using the color tags %{B-} and %{F-}, respectively, which resets to the default background/foreground. Try using that, and instead of setting the background with e.g. %{B$BACKGROUND}, like you are currently doing in barScript.sh, use %{B-} instead."
unixporn,3auace,__pirateer__,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:49:10 2015 UTC,"Figured it out! Although your solution wasn't exactly it ;). In my final echo statement, I was setting the background for the time section, but never resetting it to ""default background"" so in essence I was doing echo ""%{B$SOMECOLOR}$(PRINTTEXT), but as you can notice, there is no ending background color, so I should be doing: echo ""%{B$SOMECOLOR}$(PRINTTEXT)%{B-}. Otherwise, it looks like lemonbar 'wraps' the color around to the other end!"
unixporn,3auace,airblader,2,Mon Jun 29 02:51:48 2015 UTC,You could try quoting the variable declarations at the top. I don't think that's it but It's worth a shot. I think the best option though is what /u/z-brah said and setting the default background to what you want. I think it might implicitly reset the background color to default when it fills in the middle. If you don't want to set the background then I'd just put as many %{B$BACKGROUND}'s as possible and see if you can fix it through brute force.
unixporn,3auace,laserdude11,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"I don't use lemonbar, but my guess is that it just uses the background color of the bar when the center portion is skipped due to the right alignment directive.  Are you running a compositor such as compton? If not, try running one. If it still doesn't work, explicitly set the background color of lemonbar to a color with full opacity (see manpage) + the compositor.  But as I siad, I'm just spitballing here."
unixporn,3auace,airblader,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:25:23 2015 UTC,You gotta run a compositor for the background alpha to be noticed. Otherwise it just ignores it.   Just apply compton to the forehead.

Many of them were exactly what you'd have expected from a late-90s Linux desktop, but quite a few were amazing.  Most of those that survived aren't without their problems, either -- they're low-res, often for 4:3 monitors, and look like crap on modern screens.

Okay, I'm not necessarily ecstatic about this one in particular -- there are far better WindowMaker themes out there (one of them posted in this thread, in fact) -- but I think it's ok. I have a lot of good memories about Window Maker desktops; I learned to program on one, and I passionately read about NeXT -- I didn't get to use it too much at the time, as NeXT stations were pretty rare and very expensive.  I'm not thinking of the NeXT-inspired aesthetic in particular. I got stuck to WM because I've used it a lot and really do think the NeXT interaction model is great -- but I enjoy(ed) the incredible diversity of the desktop world. Every system tried to do something new and most of them actually had their own ideas and paradigms. In terms of aesthetics, most of them were instantly recognizable. Even when they looked like crap :).  I think a lot of that has been lost in the last few years. Aesthetically, everyone seems to be focused on flat models -- that look very cartoonish to me -- and generally on just imitating OS X and simplifying everything down to uselessness, which is very off-putting to users like me."

unixporn,3ampol,legitdiamondbond,2,Tue Jun 23 10:03:26 2015 UTC,"Well, Atom is open source and offers all the goodies people look for in Sublime. Vim just puts you in another level of productivity once you get the hang of it and no text editor can't compete, emacs coming close. But going Vim means you have to promise yourself to use it for everything for -at the very least- a month or otherwise you'll never see any progress.  And with plugins Vim can extend its functionality to add things that come by default in Sublime.  If you ever think of going with Vim might as well start now; go through vimtutor, maybe another online tutorial, print a cheatsheet and start hacking away on it. Every functionality you want just google how to get it."

unixporn,3ampol,legitdiamondbond,2,Tue Jun 23 16:22:10 2015 UTC,"Atom feels like an IDE mostly because it's not as responsive as Sublime.

Anyways if anyone can help me with just the lag i would be happy and would use ubuntu since its simpler and easier to maintain and i have a less stress free laptop , using arch is too meh, im currently using xfce as above and its not solid or unified, its so hit and miss , and at least with unity + numix everything feels similar and good :)  Oh and battery life i dont really care about to much untill after summer, for now i dont use my laptop in school much and if i do were near outlets so i dont have to worry, but otherwise id love to be able to go a whole 13 hours as the mba 13"" advertises :)"

unixporn,3ampol,legitdiamondbond,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:52:44 2015 UTC,"I used to feel the same way: screenshots that don't show a working setup seem a little weird. There are two things to think about, though:   How interesting is a still image someone's working layout, really? How much can you really learn about their environment by looking at the two or three applications they use most often?   There's a special tag for this sub (""Workflow"") that can be used for videos and GIFs of people doing work, and I think there's a distinct lack of those here. The few that I've seen--and the ones I see most often on YouTube, that annoy the crap out of me--are just people opening and closing a bunch of windows. The problem with that is that once you've seen what that looks like in one window manager, you've seen what it looks like in every other window manager of the same class. It says nothing about how the window manager might actually be used.   I'd love to see more two- to four-minute videos of someone doing real work in their WM of choice, to help give people an idea of how they might work with that WM as well. The best I've seen so far is this herbstsluftwm demo, and even that one is just the submitter messing around rather than doing work.  As a side note in a similar vein, I get annoyed when looking at screenshots of a bunch of randomly floated windows in a tiling WM, but that's another rant altogether :P"

That is the atmospheric pressure on the weather forecast. I actually run this on a 2013 ASUS laptop with 8GB of RAM. And XFCE was my main DE for the last few years because of the low footprint. I still love it, however, with this latest update, Cinnamon behaves quite nicely, with CPU sticking at 0-1% when idle and memory consumption at boot around 400MB. I use it with all effects disabled. Also it is not as hungry for additional memory as Plasma 5 or GNOME 3.16, at least on my system. Therefore I decided to adopt Cinnamon and recommend it to everyone looking for a GTK3+ environment, it should work great with as little as 2GB of RAM, maybe even less if the user is careful."

I was reading the Openbox documentation and figured out I could do everything I do in i3 in Openbox, but with a much better floating mode and better panel support.  Those three points you made are exactly why I started using a tiliing-WM. From what I've found, the only thing that a tiling-WM doesn't do that a well configured floating-WM can't do is an automatic layout that makes the best use of availible screen-real-estate. To me, that's a moot point because I found my self manually tiling anyway.  People assume that a floating WM has to use the mouse because they never spent more than 5 minutes configuring one. That and keyboard-control not a well-advertised feature of any floating-WM, unlike any of the major non-hipster tiling-WMs."

I'm sure with enough practice and configuration I could get it down, but I'm lazy and value the organization of tiling windows too much. There's honestly nothing wrong with using a floating wm, and having keyboard shortcuts set as you do probably makes you much more efficient than someone using a mouse."
unixporn,3aemor,p4p3r,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:21:39 2015 UTC,I'd guess because the floating window managers in windows and os x don't have great hotkey support and are not very configurable

unixporn,3aemor,airblader,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"Because for tiling wm mouse makes a lot less sense than keyboard, and most (if not all sans exceptions on purpose) of them started first with keyboard support. E.g. i3 has gotten the 'click to close' functionality relatively recently. The approach is certainly keyboard-first.  Conversely for floating wm keyboard makes a lot less sense than mouse, and most (...) of them started with mouse support first. IMO, for a floating wm to classify as keyboard-first it should already have built-in support and sane defaults for things like moving and resizing windows in large steps, small steps, selecting windows, probably a window search and so on. Not many floating wm have this. And historically most floating wm had very poor support of keyboard altogether.  Hence the default association. And: it's just a default.  Also: hacking it with xdo and/or xbindkeys doesn't count for either group."

Not many floating wm have this. And historically most floating wm had very poor support of keyboard altogether.   Well, my floating WM has support for all of that in its hotkey configuration style without hacking with xdotool or xbindkeys. So did others I used.  But I actually am on the fence of a ""hotkey file"" within a window manager. It violates the unix philosophy, a window manager should not also serve as something like xbindkeys or xchainkeys or whatever. It should just manage the placement of windows. It should not come with a bar, it should not draw decorations, it should not do composition and it should not bind hotkeys to commands or even its own window management. That should be done by other applications, it should simply expose a D-BUS or some command line interface to control its window placement to allow a dedicated hotkey-binding program to do all that.  I currently have two hotkey files on my computer, one .xbindkeysrc.scm and one .fluxbox/keys, it's kind of unelegant.  I'm not sure where your claim comes from that floating WM's historically had very poor support for this. Every floating WM I ever used, and this includes basal things like Kwin and metacity had support for all this."

It was released on August 24, 1995,   and was a significant progression from the company's previous Windows products.  Windows 95 integrated Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. It featured significant improvements over its predecessor, Windows 3.1, most notably in the graphical user interface (GUI) and in its relatively simplified ""plug-n-play"" features. There were also major changes made at lower levels of the operating system, such as moving from a mainly 16-bit architecture to a pre-emptively multitasked 32-bit architecture.  Accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign,  Windows 95 was a major success in the marketplace at launch and shortly became the most popular desktop operating system. [citation needed] It also introduced numerous functions and features that were featured in later Windows versions, such as the taskbar, the 'Start' button, and the way the user navigates. It was also suggested that Windows 95 had an effect of driving other major players (including OS/2) out of business, something which would later be used in court against Microsoft.

unixporn,39xbsp,nath_schwarz,12,Mon Jun 15 16:51:03 2015 UTC,"Hi! Our sidebar on /r/zsh includes a few reasons why zsh is the shell of choice for many terminal users. Our wiki also has a list of related sites that give a lot of information.  Zsh is great because it has a much more powerful completion system than bash and comes with quite a few (if you use tools for which no completions are available there's also the zsh-completions project, from where completions are merged upstream when they're tested).  Other than that zsh offers a lot good tools for power users, such as the zmv command, which lets you move and copy files based on simple shell globs and a wide range of powerful glob and expansion flags.  If you don't use the terminal that much it won't help you more than bash, but if you are using the terminal daily it will be helpful."

unixporn,39xbsp,diepfanne,11,Mon Jun 15 17:42:52 2015 UTC,"i mainly use zsh for it's completion and correction engines. i'm a very fast typist, but not always the most accurate. i like my shell smart enough to realize i ment ~http/ when i type ~htttp/. also i sometimes forget which flag to use for some option, just pressing command <tab> completes are list of options and what they do. shell globbing/expansions are also really helpful. it's very bash like and has great compatibility modes (i try and write posix shell scripts). i've tried these features in other shells, they exist, but zsh seems faster and just works for me.  vim is another animal entirely.  i was a long time sublime text 2 user (i own a key, * gasp! *), and a friend of mine works at jetbrains. so i've used both these ide's a great deal both at work and in personal situations. sublime is very nice, but php/webstorm takes forever to load and a just to bloated for my tastes. (sorry john! ;~;)  first and foremost, vim/vi is everywhere. if you connect to some random unix (like) machine you can be pretty sure that vim or at least vi will be available. the motions and commands are so powerful. e.g. fixing all the indentation in the file is as simple as typing gg=G. i refactor and extend a lot of other peoples code at work, and it's great just being able to run raw regex against the file(s). have some external application you want to run against your current file/buffer? (e.g. json pretty print or an uglify script) it's as simple as :! somescript %. vim is very lightweight, yet is feature packed. but it's vast and powerful plugin system can add nearly any feature that other modern editors have. but since most plugins are autonomous you can add only the features you want. keeping it fast, light, and tailored to your needs. as you mentioned i use YouCompleteMe and syntastic plugins for auto-completions and linting/validations. if you need a file manager in vim just type :Vex, :Sex, :Hex or :Tex depending on your mood and screen setup. and did i mention mah freedoms? take a look at the license for vim versus sublime and webstorm.  finally, i'm a terminal guy. 3 out of 4 times i'll choose a command line application over a gui one. so using a text mode editor just makes sense for me. it keeps my workflow focused in the terminal."

Some times these wm don't have good documentation (i3 the exception here). I guess my preference of DE comes down to what I want to put in the time to learn and right now that doesn't involve heavy customization, I rather put that time into learning linux, programming, netsec etc..

unixporn,39plfw,Fireblasto,4,Sat Jun 13 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"GIMP is probably best for this. If you're not used to GIMP, here's a quick run-down of some setup and the crop process:   I recommend setting it to single-window mode; it makes GIMP a lot more manageable. After opening your image, use the rectangle select tool to make your selection (works just like MS Paint), then ""Crop image to selection."" File > Export. If you select ""Save,"" it'll save in GIMP's format. ""Export"" allows you to save in a common format (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).   However, if you're looking to take a selective screenshot off-the-bat, I recommend gnome-screenshot, which works a lot like Snipping Tool from Windows.  Both packages are available in the Ubuntu repos and should be a quick visit to the Ubuntu Software Center or a simple apt-get install away."

The only real difference is that it's obviously not rolling release, and the installer is a lot more convenient.  I install via netinst, install nothing but the base system, and then install all the packages I want manually via the console and configure everything the way I want it. Most things play nice, but there are a lot of little personal tweaks to do when I first set up my system (for whatever reason I still haven't taken the time to back up my dotfiles). Setting up my custom openbox keyboard shortcuts and behaviors is by far the most tedious part of it.  I used to love conky but eventually I feel like I barely ever see my desktop anyway so it's just sitting there wasting resources (granted, not a lot of them) for eye candy. I long since abandonned desktop icons (on both Linux and Windows) just because I don't see the point of them. I only have a wallpaper just so I have something pretty to look at when I happen to not have any windows open. I anticipate some day I might even abandon that. (In fact I'm about to begin experimenting with a fully GPL-compatible console-only system based on gNewSense on my netbook.)  I'm proud that I have a fully usable development/workstation desktop system fully configured in easily under 1GB.

unixporn,39h9gz,noelsusman,36,Thu Jun 11 22:28:53 2015 UTC,"Story time!  Coming up for 2 years ago I read a Reddit post about how people who use open source with out contributing back are leeching off the community and should get involved or stop. While the post is obviously bullshit something in it stuck with me and I started to feel guilty. I looked around for a project I could give back to, but it was limited - I knew a bit of python, no design skills, and that was it. I saw a post from the Numix Project appealing for icons requests and so it was with that which I went.  I started by reporting issues, icon requests and minor bugs. This got me used to GitHub. I then wanted to submit a symlink fix, so in installed git and read articles on how to use it. My first pull was rejected because it turned out just to be a text file containing the name of the target file. My second for containing reference to my home directory. My third got in. It was a momentus occasion for me, and I could have probably stopped there. The guilt was gone. But I'd got the itch.  After a few more symlink requests I wanted to go further, and fulfil some whole icon requests. I asked one of the Numix designers what I'd need and was told to use Inkscape. After playing around a bit with the controls I opened up one of the existing icons, savaged it, and submitted a pull request. It was needless to say rejected. After a few more failed attempts and some guidance from a senior dev I finally got one in. A few more followed that, various recolours and redesigns and such.  Not to this wasn't enough for me, but it wasn't enough for me. I wanted to make an entire icon theme based on Numix. I played around with a few ideas (including amfull monochrome Numix Circle which I still have cicking around) but most either looked terrible or were rejected. Then I happened upon a comment here in /r/unixporm along the lines of ""gosh darn, I love Numix but I wish they had a Square version"". I was by no means a master of Inkscape, but I knew how to make a square and by Jove that was enough. I worked for 3 days solid and made Numix Square. It got signed by Numix and was made an official icon theme.  Around this time approached the moderators about doingna survey in this sub. They agreed, and I set it up. But because of limitations with Google Drive, I wouldn't be able to visualise the data given when people e termed ""other"" options. Oh no! I started looking around for another solution but just couldn't find software that made nice looking graphs to my specifications. I was just about to give up and do the whole thing in LibreOffice when a request for a graph icon in Numix gave me the idea of drawing it in Inkscape. It wasn't perfect, but it worked!  Because Inkscape isn't designed to be used as graphing software all the data had to be entered by hand. Bar heights were calculated based on frequencies as pixies, pie charts the same but with degrees. I'm a mathematician by trade so the data manipulation wasn't a problem. Now of course I realise the whole thing could be done in something like GNU Octave but now live got the templates from last year I was reluctant to switch. But anyway, over the course of two weeks I worked solidly and after  lot of messing around and refining it was done.  I won't mess you around with the year in between too much: my contributions to Numix got so frequent they brought me on as part-official, then later full-official member of the team. I now maintain Numix, Circle, Square, and a few other side projects so spend most of my working hours in Inkscape and constantly learning new things about it. While it's not a perfect piece of software it's pretty flexible and the controls are good for picking up. Christ this has been long. Not very on topic either. I should probably add a TLDR so I can actually answer your question.  TL;DR: learn by doing. Inkscape is free so you can literally just download it and get started. If it's these visualisations in particular you're interested it, just download the source from GitHub (link above) open any of the SVG files and get meddling. Change the colours, shapes, add new shapes, get used to the controls. Once you're comfortable with how things work and how to modify existing stuff try making a new file from scratch. Keep trying new things with it and eventually you'll be able to use it pretty well. I still in no way know the software inside out, but the more time you spend with it the more tricks you come across and the more comfortable you become.  If you need any help with it or something similar just PM me and I'm more than happy to lend a hand."

unixporn,39h9gz,z-brah,11,Thu Jun 11 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"As an OSX user, icon themes are kind of hard now with the changes Mavericks and Yosemite brought. I'm using a couple different themes, but I'm really considering going back to native simply because themes aren't applied very well. For instance, in my dock I have Steam running. I have set a custom icon for it in LiteIcon, edited every executable, and yet the icon in my dock is still the default icon. Same goes for Battle.net. Even folders.  In addition, there are some dynamic icons in OSX that are hard to properly theme. The Calendar app and the trash bin, for example.  Icons on OSX are just hard and inconvenient to theme. I just keep a minimal dock instead."
unixporn,39h9gz,thefinestdoge,5,Thu Jun 11 19:43:07 2015 UTC,"And to make it even harder, they reset often and sometimes with out any reason. Most of the time updates cause the icon to switch back to the default one, but sometimes it is just out of the blue, like wtf?. It's seriously annoying."

Much nicer completion. I'd say my learning curve was a few months, but nothing major. I definitely suggest starting out small (don't go overboard and load every plugin you can find).

We go looking for our text manipulation utilities, (grep, etc) get lost and dismiss it.  Powershell is amazing once you start figuring out its potential with using objects and writing extensions to it rather than just typing up long shell scripts. Bash has its limits, and when you hit them you have to switch over to a proper programming language. Powershell doesn't have that problem."

unixporn,3900u0,z-brah,18,Mon Jun 8 06:47:41 2015 UTC,"Showing off a few possibilities of wmutils. The project consists of a set of small tools that can act directly on X windows (as opposed to wmctrl which sends EWMH requests to running window managers).  You can find all the scripts advertised here, and more in the contrib repo.   If you want to give it a quick go, you can download a ""bootstrapped"" wmutils environment (xinitrc + wmutils + scripts) with the following command (note that you will need to have libxcb, urxvt and sxhkd installed):  curl -s http://sprunge.us/SNYM | base64 -d | tar xz   and then run startx /path/to/extracted/wm/xinitrc from a TTY to start an X session based on wmutils.  This bootstrap is rather simple: uses urxvt as terminal, with a preconfigured xresources. Default keybinds (as written in sxhkdrc) are:   mod4 + enter - urxvt mod4 + space - thinglaunch (included in the bootstrap) mod4 + h,j,k,l - move window mod4 + H,J,K,L - resize window mod4 + y,u,b,n,g - teleport window to top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, middle of the screen alt + tab - cycle windows alt + h,j,k,l - focus windows based on their positions mod4 + t - tile windows mod4 + s - put window in fore/background   Read sxhkdrc for more infos. Scripts and wmutils are avail in the bin/ directory. Read them for examples on how to use wmutils.  EDIT: that was kori's idea."

unixporn,38yxco,tomakotheblue,13,Mon Jun 8 13:49:13 2015 UTC,"In Linux, the ""framebuffer"" is a virtual device which encapsulates the video hardware directly.  Typically with GUI programs in Linux, you need X-Windows, which provides a level of abstraction to the framebuffer. Typically your software makes requests of the Windows manager / desktop environments (Gnome, KDE, dwm, ratpoison, i3, awesome, etc.), which makes requests of X-server, which manages calls to the framebuffer, which talks to the video hardware (that's somewhat simplified).  The positive is that your software doesn't need to know anything about the graphics environment - it just updates its windows/views/etc. - and the Windows Manager / X-windows decide how everything should look, and sends the graphical data to the framebuffer, which updates the hardware.  The drawback is that the whole GUI setup - X-windows, Windows manager, etc. adds a lot of complexity, overhead, packages, etc.  If a piece of software can talk to the framebuffer directly, then you don't need any of that overhead.   Some command-line level software can do this - feh (image viewer) and mplayer (video) can both write directly to the framebuffer without ever needing an X-windows environment. You can use these from a TTY console. NetSurf will even web browse to the framebuffer.  TYPICALLY the only time you NEED to do this is small, embedded Linux installations like a Raspberry Pi running a kiosk (like an interactive mall map, or airline check in), where your hardware is so small that every bit of complexity counts."

unixporn,38yxco,Spivak,2,Tue Jun 9 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: you can only run X applications against X servers. import IS an X application.  TTY -> character device X.org -> Graphical server  Each X server is attached to a TTY, so if you start an X server on TTY3, then you'll not be able to use TTY3. You can refer to each X display by specifying which X server to contact, on which display and which screen. Basically:  DISPLAY=:0.0 xterm   will ask to the local X server to start an xterm on display 0, screen 0.  In the same way,  import -window root -display :0.0   Will take a screenshot of the root window (the desktop) of the display 0, screen 0. If you type this command on the TTY, it means that you don't have any X display attached to your current console, especially not display :0. Then this will NOT take a screenshot of your TTY.  As an example, let's say you're in a building with 4 rooms:  +--------+--------+ |        |        | |   R0   |   R1   | |        |        | +--------+--------+ |        |        | |   R2   |   R3   | |        |        | +--------+--------+   In every room, the light is off. And you have a telecommand to turn the light on, and take a picture of each room by specifying its name. You obviously can't take a picture of a dark room.  You sit in R0, and decide to light up R3, and picture it:  user@building:~ $ light on :R3 user@building:~ $ picture :R3   Now if you try to take a picture of room R2:  user@building:~ $ picture :R2 picture: can't seen anything in room :R2, aborting.   the same will occur in your own room  user@building:~ $ picture  picture: can't seen anything in room , aborting.   So picture == import, light on/off start/stop X"

Gnome feels half-finished to me, without a load of extensions, and XFCE seems to be a patchwork.  Cinnamon is my current favourite full floating DE, but if the unity launcher could be customised a bit more, frankly there wouldn't be much in it. I too use Nemo in whatever environment I've picked.

I went back to Mint but with the XFCE version for a short time then went to Xubuntu, to Ubuntu MATE for a couple of months then back to Xubuntu. I actually really like XFCE but it just feels too far behind the times now. I have all kinds of frustrations with setting audio inputs and outputs and problems with bluetooth. All of these worked fine right away in Unity. Since I had like Unity in the past, I decided to give it a good try again and get over the orange theme and the Ubuntu font. Honestly after about 45 minutes of telling myself to just ignore the theme and font and actually try Unity, I fell right in line with it. I remembered why I liked it originally and I know how to use it even better now (a couple of indicator plugins helped this out). Then Nemo gave me back a couple of the features I was missing from Thunar! Basically the only thing that frustrates me is not being able to change the font of the category headers in the Unity Launcher. If I could do that, I'd be perfectly set."

unixporn,38qqd5,antflga,9,Sat Jun 6 00:36:50 2015 UTC,"I'd like to start by saying I hope this doesn't come off as rtfm. Honestly the way I got to understand the way bspwm works was reading the bspc man page. If you're lazy (like I was before I started getting more curious) just read the commands and the configuration options. That'll probably get you 90% there and give you a pretty good understanding on how bspwm operates.   You should understand the separation between sxhkd and bspwm though. All sxhkd does is run commands based off of keypresses. It can be anything from launching your terminal to instructing bspwm what to do. It has nothing to do with how bspwm reacts to those commands and likewise bspwm has nothing to do with how the keypresses are interpreted. Baskerville (the dev of both) has been nothing but helpful when I've had questions and there should be better documentation on the github pages of both projects coming soon as I've seen a bit of talk about writing some.  With all that said, there are a few things in i3 that would be a little more difficult, though not impossible, to implement in bspwm. Something like a titlebar on windows requires quite a bit of scripting but I've seen it done. Likewise with splits that act like i3's tree other than bspwm's.   I3's tree isn't binary and bspwm's is. That's why when you keep creating new windows in i3, it splits vertically until you tell it to stop, but in bspwm it creates a Fibonacci-esque layout. Now in bspwm you can define which direction the split occurs with presel (I don't remember the specific command) and change the split ratio with another command.  As far as the bar goes MAKE SURE you check out the examples directory of the bspwm repo. It'll give you a pretty decent setup assuming you integrate it correctly and have all the right packages installed. The first thing I always do is replace the time thing with conky and that's pretty simple to do once you familiarize yourself with the way the script works.  Overall I think the best advice is to pick a tiling wm based off how you feel about it. I liked i3's ease of use but it's bar left a lot to be desired imho so I picked bspwm and I haven't been happier. I've also tried dwm and xmonad which use (pretty much) the same tiling paradigm. Awesomewm is pretty different from everything else. The strength of bspwm is that it's only a window manager. It does nothing more nothing less. That's why you can do so much with it and really make things like DexUI with it. There's a really high limit to what you can achieve."

I stare at LED backlit displays all day and night and if I don't increase warm color-temperature it affects my vision and dries my eyes out, sometimes even leaving them blood-shot red at the end of the day. Redshift and f.lux really helps reduce the strain for me and lets me stare at a screen non-stop for days.  The default xterm colors are generally really bright and probably bother a lot of other people, which is why you might see a lot of comments about the colors.  edit I did find this optomtry paper that implies there is a connection between blue wave light and Macular Degeneration, but I admit it doesn't seem to be a very well studied field yet."

I used the line font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 6 somewhere in my .i3/config to do that, and then the same line with a different fontsize in the bar { part of the config to get a seperate font size for the bar. You can get rid of borders entirely with new_window border none, though that might also get rid of the titles. Maybe with new_window 1pixel?"

In contrast, i3 and (especially) awesome are more monolithic, providing keybinding facilities, status bars, gui widgets, etc. while bspwm only manages windows.  As for the top-voted screenshots featuring bspwm: avid ricers (who would undoubtedly produce high quality desktops regardless of their WM) likely choose bspwm for the aforementioned reasons. The screenshots aren't upvoted because of bspwm.  A contributing factor could also be that bspwm was created by an Arch Linux user and posted on its forum, and it appears that quite a few members of this subreddit use Arch."
unixporn,38f0d6,supplantr,4,Wed Jun 3 20:50:54 2015 UTC,I understand your point about the unix philosophy.
unixporn,38f0d6,ANOKNUSA,5,Wed Jun 3 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"In contrast, i3 and (especially) awesome are more monolithic, providing keybinding facilities, status bars, gui widgets, etc. while bspwm only manages windows.   Sorry, but I'd have to say you're way off here:   The i3 window manager, statusbar, key command interface, configuration parser, screen locker, and statusline generator are all separate programs. They're designed to work well together, but you can replace them if you want. It's easy to replace i3bar with dzen2, say, and I'd bet many people use either conky or i3blocks or some such to create a statusline. i3bar and i3status are not hard-coded into the window manager. Just like bspwm, i3 key commands are parsed from the config file by the parser at start-up time, and keypresses are sent to the window manager via a shell command (i3-msg). A keypress is equivalent to ""i3-msg <command>."" That shell command can be exectued any way the user wants---directly from a shell, or through dmenu, or even through sxhkd---but the included config parser was designed to work directly with the window manager. Similarly, sxhkd was created by the same guy who created bspwm, for the purpose of controlling bspwm. Yes, you can use another hotkey daemon, but will you? Is there good reason to? You'd have to completely rewrite your own configs from scratch, and you'd have the bspwm defaults (configured by the creator specifically to work with sxhkd) installed on your system. Same goes for i3.   The only real difference is that the i3 programs are all bundled together as a single distribution.That's about it, and the fact that some programs are not bundled with their intended counterparts doesn't mean they aren't essential parts of a whole---dmenu was originally created specifically for dwm, for example. It's not bundled with dwm, but it's considered a key component and the dwm developer assumes you have dmenu installed."
unixporn,38f0d6,supplantr,3,Fri Jun 5 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"I suppose my description of i3 did it a disservice. It is significantly modular in much the same way bspwm and sxhkd are. However, I don't think it's accurate to say that i3's configuration parser is separate. I'd also like to dispute the accuracy of your 2nd point. At least the statement that bspwm parses a config file is false. It runs an executable file. And, while I know that i3 has an IPC interface, I thought it simply parsed its default config file to define settings and internal keybindings, and the i3-msg utility is optional. I could be wrong about this."
unixporn,38f0d6,vernesque,2,Fri Jun 5 23:06:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. It's very minimal and very easily configurable if you're comfortable with scripting (I absolutely love dwm, but I was getting sick of pulling my hair out every time it updated.)  I'd use awesome if it didn't insist on trying to do everything (I love its notifications and menubar, I just wish I could configure the goddamn statusbar without installing 3 extra packages.) xmonad just has way, way more to offer than I need from my setup."
unixporn,38f0d6,5225225,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:58:38 2015 UTC,"However, you could easily disable i3's keybindings and use your own program for it.

A lot of things just refuse to work without a tray."
unixporn,38f0d6,Foggalong,10,Thu Jun 4 14:02:49 2015 UTC,A small correction which no one else seems to have brought up: i3 has massive presence here.  We did a survey last year of what UnixPorn users were using on their machines and i3 won hands down out of all the DEs and WMs. We did it again this year and despite a massive flock of people moving to using a fork (i3gaps) original i3 still came out high above everything else.

In bspwm you can arbitrarily split any window and create any layout you want.  I think i3 is even better that bspwm, though. It's also tree-like but with more features."
unixporn,38f0d6,Remedan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:44:22 2015 UTC,To be fair tree-based window management is theoretically possible in Awesome. You just need to write the layout to manage it and I haven't seen anyone do so.

I use Docky in panel mode on the left along with the Numix Shine icon set, which is no longer supported by its developers but still works just fine.  The Whisker menu is also a must for me as a launcher, a zillion times better than the default applications menu-- on Arch it's available through the xfce4-goodies group, there's probably a similar group if you're using a different distro.

unixporn,38679g,dknabel,10,Tue Jun 2 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"I am assuming that by terminal colours you mean just the .Xresources colours. (vim colorschemes are a whole different beast and it isn't easy to create a well behaved one). For terminal colours, there are basically two choices:  1. Use existing schemes  You can select a nice colorscheme from xcolors, dotshare, here at /r/unixporn, or the varoius forum threads on screenshots.  2. Create your own  You may want to create you own colours coordinating with the desktop background. It is a simple matter of exracting the colours from the image and using them in your .Xresrources. I know of three ways to achieve this. In the increasing order of effort, they are:  a. Use a script like this or this  to directly get nice terminal colours from the image. schemer by /u/thefryscorer gets my vote.  b. Use gimp to extract the colours palette from image and use them.  c. Use online tools like this to get colours from an image, and this to get complementary colours.  Note that generated colours may require some tweaking to get them right. There are also tools like terminal.sexy, and colorize to help you design a colorscheme."

I am running my first Linux distro (Arch). I am now learning/using how to pc, basically. I wanted a learning experience and I got one.   This is the result of about two weeks of searching and learning how to customize my pc. I have no programming background but I've already learned a lot.   Don't expect any dotfiles, because I haven't even thought about hosting stuff on GitHub yet."
unixporn,37wpbn,steelcowboy1,3,Sun May 31 01:03:09 2015 UTC,"Right on! Welcome to Arch!

Now that I'm older and wiser I've moved to Openbox, but been interested in i3 -- just not sure how well Chrome would like it"
unixporn,37wpbn,kriskropd,2,Sun May 31 01:23:20 2015 UTC,I've been using Chromium and haven't had any problems with the two. Although I've gathered from reading here that you can't do much to customize it to fit your scheme like other browsers.
unixporn,37wpbn,-Pelvis-,3,Sun May 31 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"That's brave. Welcome aboard.  I started with Crunchbang, though back then I was advocating Ubuntu for newbies to Linux - and still kind of do for the less PC-literate.  Archlinux makes a lot of things accessible. While it might not be the easiest to install, it's probably the easiest to familiarize with Linux in-general (especially thanks to the incredible amount of documentation in its wiki). Make sure to check out the AUR some time. Using yaourt has added a level of software exploration to my experience that is much broader than the pacman repositories could offer. I would also recommend using ddg.gg as your main web browser search engine. For one, you can easily access the Arch Wiki search by simply including the !bang '!aw'. You will be visiting that wiki a lot, probably - or you already knew that.  You're on a good path, just make sure to back-up your files and make mistakes to enhance the learning process :D It gets fun if you can figure out what doesn't work along the way."
unixporn,37wpbn,Vargman,1 point,Sun May 31 02:32:51 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same position as OP, I've had Arch for two weeks and I love it. This is after some flirting with Linux in the past, but always being Windows primary.  This time I burned Windows 8 after it blew up on me, and I put Arch on my SSD. I love the wiki, and it's been a tremendous help, but sometimes there's a scary amount of stuff to tweak to get programs to function decently.  I need an ELI5 for the AUR; what do the different packers do? I've heard packer recommended; does it do the same thing as yaourt? I've heard some people recommend only using AUR packers once you understand thoroughly what they do. I really don't want to fuck up my system; I've put hours into it already, tweaking and getting it where I want, and I haven't backed up yet (I don't know how yet, hahaha!).  Also, is there a way to get pacman to autocomplete package names when installing? Example:  $ pacman -S bas<tab>  $ base-devel"
unixporn,37wpbn,kriskropd,3,Sun May 31 07:14:12 2015 UTC,"As always (or at least 95% of the time), it's already answered in the wiki:  AUR  AUR helpers  In short: you need to understand what's happening in the AUR and you need to be able to use makepkg. Once you get that you can switch to an AUR helper just for the sake of convenience. Some of them just search and download the tarball and you still need to manually build it using makepkg (like cower). Others will handle everything from downloading to building and installing (like yaourt).  I think that none of the helpers is in the regular repo's (could be wrong....) so you need to build your helper yourself."
unixporn,37wpbn,-Pelvis-,2,Sun May 31 07:44:23 2015 UTC,"To autocomplete pacman packages, install bash-completion package. It will not start until a new shell is spawned. Alternatively, there is also a zsh-completion package if you use zsh.    I've never personally used packer, but I like yaourt because it mimics pacman with its arguments and is easy for me to relate with. Yaourt on ArchWiki explains in the brief Installation segment which two package you will need to install via the official instructions for using AUR. By the time you have installed those two packages, yaourt should be working and you should be briefly aware of how the AUR functions and what the AUR Helpers are automating for you. You don't need to glorify the AUR to understand what it's doing, really.  As explained on the AUR ArchWiki page the repository is community-driven and relies on makepkg to build from PKGBUILD files. For starters, I would recommend simply reading the AUR ArchWiki up to part 5. Sharing and Maintaining packages - It's not a lot to read and you really should be getting your feet wet before worrying about submitting packages or anything else further down the page. To simply use yaourt or packer, you should have all that you really need to understand covered by that point.  The enthusiasm for understanding what the AUR is is to make sure you understand the basics. For instance: packages on the AUR are maintained with less reliability and so you need to observe a package before installing and determine yourself if it will even install on your system or if it might even harm your system. Or, sometimes you might find a package dependency that won't install because it has actually been renamed to something else and needs to be installed seperately. There are other little details like how a package on the AUR will never say it depends on base-devel package despite EVERY package on AUR demanding that package. Stuff like that you will learn by reading the first few paragraphs of the AUR ArchWiki page and by simply experimenting yourself. Like I said before, keep back-ups and don't be afraid to make mistakes.  Don't hesitate or feel threatened by it ^.^ it's not all that difficult compared to many other things you will face while using linux.    If there is any other tip I could give, it would be to keep you system up to date. Archlinux is a rolling release system and delaying to pacman -Syu or yaourt -Syu for several weeks can sometimes lead to situations that demand a lot of your time to resolve."
unixporn,37wpbn,Hakzyme,2,Sun May 31 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I am now up and running with yaourt, and I understand the basics of the AUR. You gave good advice, and summed it up well for someone who was feeling overwhelmed.  I will pass the torch!  Also, I noticed you did a little plug for DDG - I've actually been converting people for two years. !bangs are amazing. I've got about fifty memorized. I highly recommend going to the page with the list of bangs, reading through it, writing down the useful ones, and keeping a sticky on your monitor bevel/text file open on another workspace until they're memorized.  !arch, !aur and !gh have been super handy."
unixporn,37wpbn,-Pelvis-,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:15:10 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure a completion package won't help autocomplete package names when installing packages that aren't installed...I'm really not sure if there is a solution for that.

unixporn,37l08c,z-brah,3,Thu May 28 16:48:05 2015 UTC,So do you run getty on /dev/ttyS0 to interface a terminal such as the VT-510 to your Linux system?  I have never used a physical dumb terminal before so I am not sure how you connected it.
unixporn,37l08c,necrophcodr,4,Thu May 28 12:37:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, but agetty and /dev/ttyUSB0, because it's an usb-serial cable. agetty daemons are handled by runit services in Void, I can configure additional variables, like $TERM or baudrate too."

I tried software and hardware flow control to no avail. I did just move it back to 9600 but curious if you see the same problem.
unixporn,37l08c,necrophcodr,5,Thu May 28 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"I'm having the same issue with anything greather than 19200bps, because I'm using only XON/XOFF flow control. And we (both of us) must have a proper hardware flow control soldering for that terms.  Listen to me now: That type of terminal uses DTR and DSR as flow control pins, instead of CTS and RTS. Every software (Linux and BSDs) have those pins hard-coded without possibility to change. So, if you have an DB9-DB25 adapter like me, you must resolder CTS/RTS pair to DTS/DSR, and your flow control will work.  Reply if you done that."

As in you can't change the default directories for sources, packages and such.

The devs were like ""lel, just do what we say"", and I found no way to actually customize the process, and thus, integrate it in a live environment.  Hence my question (which wasn't specific enough, sorry about that): How did you use the package build system? by just following step by step the README?

Back in the days, I could not find any doc on changing the structure of the xbps-src environment.  I also had a few problem with managing config.h based packages. Not sure what my issue was though (it was a year ago or so...).  But overall, I found xbps-src a bit painful to use, and rather not instinctive. Some actions did not really make sense to me (I'm used to package things for arch, crux, alpine and centos for reference). But as I said, that was like one year ago, so maybe it changed since.

This makes the contrast between colors ""pop"" without burning your eyes out because the font is sharp. Hinting and anti-aliasing blurs the edges of a font to make it look more ""rounded"", which leads to colors looking faded out in contrast with the green/blue background.       Here are two examples: Left is bitmap font, no hinting, no anti-aliasing, right is TTF font with hinting and anti-aliasing.    http://anonimag.es/i/88cb958d54e3d3d20b2bdbd27c8c4f9e.png  Notice how the right looks faded and kind of washed out compared to the left, the difference is more noticeable at smaller point fonts.     Here is the same shot but with a different, higher contrast colorscheme (jellybeans-256).  http://anonimag.es/i/e7e7ebf7fd24b7ed4480283c74bf858a.png  This time, the higher contrast colorscheme makes the right side look OK, but the left side way too bright and therefore likely to cause eye-strain and fatigue after long extended sessions."

unixporn,37if02,_skrzyp_,5,Fri May 29 15:26:44 2015 UTC,"Time to start racking our brain for another way to increase content diversity.   I think we should first define what diversity is. Are we tired of seeing the same window managers? The same dotfiles? Color palettes?... wallpapers?  The content here already seems about as diversified as it will get for the tools available. All sorts of window managers and all sorts of colors and fonts. So, I think I might need some clarity on what diversification is missing from this sub-reddit. A lot of what is popular today looks pretty similar to what I've seen available since back in 2009 and I'm sure has been around since even before then. It might not be new, but it is still good.  And the people follow design trends because it looks good, even if it might not be original or new anymore. Such is most art. It's pretty difficult to diversify outside of the few variations that really are available without sacrificing more than just a sliver of actual functionality."
unixporn,37if02,kriskropd,4,Thu May 28 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"Look at the context in which we were talking :P diversity a way from just screenshots, into hardware, workflows, tutorials, etc"
unixporn,37if02,_skrzyp_,3,Thu May 28 17:44:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand then.  Though while that seems like a healthy combination of different things, I do have to wonder what will attract people the most in this subreddit. It seems as if people most largely come here to share screenshots and gain attention based on how much eyecandy their thumbnail exposes. It's not exclusive, but to me appears to be the greater niche. It must not feel very rewarding when diversified contributions get very little attention in comparison - so maybe there needs to be a better way to highlight this less-popular content rather than simply ban the excess content.  Coincedentally, I had just read this post that was just talking about how little attention redditors in this subreddit give to submissions that aren't immediate eyecandy. I would reference this linked post with my reply here.  I think that the best way to balance content against any sort of saturation would be to somehow highlight the less noticeable content types. To separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.  edit Arguably, trying to diversify with all those other things into this one sub-reddit might not be so great after all. As you've pointed out, there is /r/Desktop, which is a better place to locate Windows screenshots. There is also /r/Battlestations (and multiple, related derivatives) for hardware and setup aesthetics. And probably, like me, those of us trying to identify functional design from submissions here will often venture away from this subreddit eventually. A comparison of features & limitations between Reddit and Github, for instance. Thus the appeal of explicitly labeled Tutorial or Workflow content may not be all that unique from what we have already.  Let's be honest though ~ in a system where the larger audience decides what they want to see, the struggle for attention is defined by the audience and not so-much the moderators. You could risk replacing your current audience with a different set that prefers the diversity you may want in this subreddit, but by that logic, it might be better to simply start a new, additional subreddit that is focused on sharing the type of content that you may feel is limited or neglected here."
unixporn,37if02,kriskropd,1 point,Thu May 28 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is lots of people have been asking for this kind of diversity. It was highly sort after in last years survey and the #1 issue brought up this year too. If you look at the top scoring links in the sub you have to go all the way to #13 before you get a screenshot of a desktop.  So it's clearly something that audiences past and present want to see more of. We've ruled out banning excess content in this very survey, so it's just a matter of finding another way to do it."
unixporn,37if02,z-brah,2,Sat May 30 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"Great. So there is apparently a demand for this sort of stuff, and I believe it - here you can even see it. Two days ago, /u/_skrzyp_ shared a few pictures of a VT510 which was cross-posted to /r/retrobattlestations. At time of writing, the post on /r/unixporn has 380 upvotes while the one on /r/retrobattlestations only has 86. Despite those numbers, the audience that is looking for pictures of retro setups should really be looking for them on /r/retrobattlestations and not /r/unixporn, should they not? It certainly seems like it would make more sense. But I digress with that argument.  So to segue back ~ There is an undeniable demand - so what's stopping people from supplying this kind of content they want? It doesn't sound like the moderators are doing anything yet to prevent such submissions. It seems like the value of that less common content is simply too high to have a high quantity of to begin with - at least compared to the amount of redditors here who simply know how to scrot. Segregating that kind of content helps archive it and locate it better, and is why we have /r/retrobatt---   ack, I'll try not to keep derailing like that - sorry  Even though I really think pictures of retro unix machines should be shared in /r/retrobattlestations, I still think that simply highlighting those types of submissions here is a good way for moderators to show favored support for that type of content. If you really want to turn this place into a melting pot, you'll need a way to push all the other content that hardly get's noticed onto the stage where the audience can see it too, however. (link for example)  I don't really understand why content can't simply be segregated - but the majority rules every time."
unixporn,37if02,z-brah,2,Sun May 31 01:13:20 2015 UTC,"This is the reason of having so many flairs on this subreddit, like, umm Hardware which is meant to posting things like mine VT, which is literally an Unix porn IMO. Do you also want to move that Zipit Z2 submission.  Also, retrobattlestations are full ofthose C64s, Ataris, Amigas, and so on (which I have too). But I think if I'll have again, for example, Sun Ultra 10 Creator3D with Solaris 9 on it, it will be an Unix porn and I'll submit it immediately here in this case, later x-posting on other subreddits."
unixporn,37if02,kriskropd,1 point,Sun May 31 05:08:31 2015 UTC,"I have seen the flairs, but have you seen this? Having too much variety means that content gets archived faster than it accumulates here. It's not just hardware, pretty much every flair, except screenshots, is failing to flourish here.  Don't ge me wrong either - I was one of the first 50 upvotes for your VT510 submission here. I'm just saying that it seems unnecessarily difficult to accumulate so much variety in one subreddit when there are clear advantages to segregating the content types."
unixporn,37if02,z-brah,1 point,Sun May 31 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"By taking your way of thinking on that level seriously, we should split retrobattlestations into:   c64battlestations amigabattlestations ibmpcbattlestations spectrumbattlestations   and so on…  Or maybe I've got your idea a bit differently than intended"
unixporn,37if02,_skrzyp_,1 point,Sun May 31 19:40:20 2015 UTC,"Is there so much content of those items being produced that they need their own sub-reddits? I don't follow /r/retrobattlestations so I wouldn't actually know their situation very well. I would just assume content moves slower over there and they could afford to leave it all together since it matches what the audience would expect from the usual content shared there. If their audience preferred having it all separated by specific manufacturers/brands instead of having tags/flairs, then I guess splitting retrobattlestations into manufacturer specific subreddits could make sense.  It's not like I'm saying we need to have a subreddit for i3 and another one for bspwm and another for gnome and etc. etc. - I'm referring to vastly different items being mixed together and an apparent struggle for some of them to do so. Workflow and Tutorial and Hardware items would normally struggle for attention amongst a sea of screenshots. Certainly I'm not the only one that thinks that, am I? That's my reasoning for why people might not bother posting that sort of content here in /r/unixporn - and why it is so uncommon, despite being opposite of what the audience here apparently wants according to survey.    I'm just trying to help figure out why the users here say they want one thing, but then make it difficult for such content to actually be shared here. The easiest solution I could think of, so far, would be to have moderators highlight and help promote non-screenshot content."
unixporn,37if02,SolomonKull,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going to preface this by saying that when I first joined the mod team a year ago I 100% agreed with you. One of the first things I did when I started as moderator was formalise the rule that the sub should be for screenshots, discussions and nothing else. The big dream was to have /r/unixporn for screenshots & discussions, /r/unixthemes for material, /r/unixhardware for hardware, & so on and then create a multireddit to contain them all. My logic was similar to yours - it archives the content better and ensures that people are only seeing the type of content they want to. We we actually started implementing it but the change was so unpopular and had such a negative effect on traffic that we had to revert it back within just a couple of months.  So that's what changed my mind on this. Instead I implemented the flair filtering system so people can see just screenshots or just hardware. It's not the most ideal system and it definitely has its faults but people seem to like it a lot better.  As for why people don't post stuff, I don't know for definite, but I reckon it is a combination of 3 factors:   Effort. It's a lot easier to take a screenshot of your desktop that you had customised anyway than to take a photo of a desktop, make a gif, or obviously make a theme. Rarity. Because the posts are quite rare I'm guess there's a chunk of the audience that doesn't even know that we accept those kinds of posts here. Nerves. The community is a little ahem critical at times and I think that can put people off if they don't think what they have is good enough.   Maybe from here it's just a case of the mods needing to get the ball rolling on this. Have a few hardware-centric competitions, post a few of our own things, and then just see if it takes."
unixporn,37if02,kriskropd,2,Sun May 31 12:20:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe from here it's just a case of the mods needing to get the ball rolling on this. Have a few hardware-centric competitions, post a few of our own things, and then just see if it takes.   This, and also enforcing rules set to prevent low-quality content. Especially these days, where we have numix icons and paper GTK bootstrapped bootstrapped on desktops and that are posted as is (a few examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Those kind of setup do qualify as ""default"" as per the rules. They're still hanging there though, without OP receiving any warning, or seeing his post deleted. No reason wondering why people keep posting them then. No deletion, no warnings, and even a few random upvotes. It's all good then :)    We (the users) should report them, but it's not an easy task as it make you sound lame... So it's not an easy task to ""kindly"" tell people their post is not what this sub is expecting.  People don't read the rules, and will never do if you don't enforce them. I can help you do so if you want, but I'll be nazi about it and people will hate me ;)"
unixporn,37if02,meskarune,2,Thu Jun 4 08:27:37 2015 UTC,"Removing posts that break the rules just decreases the number of screenshot posts, it doesn't actually increase the overall diversity. That's not to say we won't do it, it's just a fact of the matter. As for those specific posts:   Switched out bash for zsh, custom tmux config The non-default dock config technically means that this doesn't break any rules, but I'm thinking that we should maybe switch to including ""docky"" in the list for 3.1.4 - with the rise of elementary this is going to become more of a problem I'd bet Custom panel setup, custom openbox config Compiled Budgie from source to run it on Arch as opposed to Solus, and then customised the Budgie panel itself Removed post Removed post   Reporting content is literally just clicking the report button and then typing ""default setup"". That's not a difficult thing to do by any stretch of the imagination. One of the mods will almost always get to the post within a few hours from then.

I admit the pictures were pretty though. I did not upvote it on /r/retrobattlestations. No, I still don't care all that much about retro battlestations or hardware personally, so I still don't follow /r/retrobattlestations.   I think people are taking my opinion on what would work best for everyone's content as some sort of aggression towards this subreddit. I've said it multiple times, however, that I'll support whatever this subreddit is striving for. I just think it's an unnecessary struggle when a simple link in the side bar to /r/retrobattlestations would work just as well, if not better. Affiliation between subreddits that segregate content but share an interest in content is a definite good thing.

This happens every so often---mpc is the original MPD client, just a command line client that lets you play, pause and skip songs, and add them to playlists. Someone wanting an easier, more intuitive interface created ncmpc as a frontend, and then later on (as is my understanding) someone wanting features ncmpc wrote patches for it. Later still, someone wanting even more features wrote a totally new client and called ncmpcpp, with two ""pluses"" to indicate its ""next-generation"" status after the patched ncmpcpp.  Another example is wmi (window manager improved), which was succeeded by wmii (window manager improved improved). After wmii was practically abandoned a group of folks decided to pick it up and continue developing it, but decided it was an ugly mess, so they wrote a new wmii-like window manager from scratch. Instead of calling it wmiii, they decided to just call it i3."

(The latter being something like a Windows registry that serializes/deserializes to config files, like an API to configuration)  As an automation person, nothing drives me crazier than the way chef/ansible/etc handle configuration templating with templates we use from web front ends. Configs are state serialization, so why don't we have a consistent way of reading and writing them?  If the intent is the latter, that's really cool, and allows the first purpose to be way better, because you could do things like merge configuration in neat ways without much effort."

I was actually going to start writing a program to generate a color scheme from a background,  apply it to your terminal, and I was going to attempt to write it in c++ cause that's the only language I'm really comfortable with, but I feel like every program or project I see lately on Linux is written in python, is there a reason for this or is it just preference?"
unixporn,376e5o,Winterspite,3,Mon May 25 18:29:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So to explain how it works:   There is a backend server which is hosting metadata about rices, including author, version, etc. but most importantly a link to the github repo where the rice is hosted. When the client queries the server for rices, it sends a request to the servers HTTP API, and receives a JSON response The client will parse out the JSON response and allow the user to select an option. Currently, a TUI is used, but there is a goal to use ncurses with in terminal image rendering, similar to rangers(using w3m libs). The user will select the rice they want from the options presented. The client will download the github repo that was included in the JSON and unzip it The client then reads metadata files included in the rice which instruct it where all the configs for the rice should be moved to Safety checks for any existing config files are performed and the user is asked if they want to swap out their current rice if there is any conflict The client will Symlink all files from the central RiceDB directory(~/.rdb/) into the locations indicated in the metadata   Of course there is some more nuance to all this, but the goal is to automate the whole process, and if you took a clean Awesome install you could perform the exact procedure as I did in the demo and it should work.  As far as Python goes, it was purely out of preference. We initially tried using C, but couldn't easily work through the JSON libs so ended up ditching that and going with Python, because many people knew it, and because it's a (relatively) easy to learn language so new comers wouldn't have too hard of a time getting started. If you know C++ best, then by all means use it."

unixporn,3762z7,justbuchanan,12,Mon May 25 04:46:02 2015 UTC,"Since no one answered you, I will give it a shot. However, my answer will not be specific to hlwm at all since I am not familiar with its code. As a core contributor to i3, I hope I can still give at least some insight.  You sort of already noticed your two entrance points:   The window manager itself The compositor   I'm not familiar with the X compositing extension, so my post on that is based on knowledge without any practical experience.  The window manager: if you do it there, your animation is forced to be realized through a frame-based reconfiguration of windows over time. This is fairly expensive in terms of requests to the server, but compared to what is usually going on probably still negligible. Another issue with it is that all these applications must react to those reconfigurations and depending on the application this can be expensive (assuming you want a smooth transition). You are basically not in control of performance whatsoever. Not ideal.  Another factor is that not every application plays nicely with arbitrary sizes. Granted, a tiling wm doesn't given them a choice anyway. But I'm just saying that the protocol explicitly has a mechanism for clients to specify ""steps"" in which their size should be set and if at all possible, window managers should adhere to that. In an aninmation, you cannot allow a client this freedom. Which, in turns, means that you don't know how an application will behave (to be fair, if it misbehaves it could still be considered a bug in the application).  All these issues aside, the logic should be simple enough in general terms: provide a ""queue"" of animations and state and loop frame for frame over time to play the animation. The usual animation stuff applies: don't rely on a sleep, but actually keep track of the passed time and so on and so forth. I assume it's not the first time you've worked with some sort of frame-based animation.  The hardest part is probably calculating the necessary animations on all involved clients upfront to come up with the animation plan and dealing with anything disturbing the plan (new windows coming up, a window being reconfigured mid-animation, …). Don't underestimate this; it's tough work for sure.  The part that is questionable is how complicated this is to integrate into hlwm's code. Since I'm not familiar with it, I can't say anything. Sorry.  So what about compositors? Well, some of the same problems as above will still apply. The good thing is that you take control from the clients to yourself in terms of rendering the changes in size and so on and you save yourself the roundtrips to the server. In fact, the clients will never even know that they have been animated.  Another nice thing is that working on the compositing level allows you any kind of manipulation while working on window manager level restricts you to the things X clients can do (like resizing).  I hope you found this answer remotely helpful. I'm sorry that I can't be of much help in terms of giving specific advice. My conclusion would be that this is a feature you will be spending quite some time on – it's far from trivial."
unixporn,3762z7,airblader,3,Mon May 25 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response!  That definitely helps me to understand a bit more about where this would go and how it would work.  I've got a good bit of experience with animations, although it's mostly on  iOS where the actual details are handled behind the scenes for you.  I'll take some time to read up more on how the window manager and compositor interface with X and see if I can't find a good way to implement this.  It'd be nice if I could do it with minimal changes to the existing window manager code (although it'll obviously require some) to keep it somewhat portable to other WMs.  I'll most likely have it take a snapshot of the window and perform the animation on the saved image as opposed to resizing the actual window over several time steps.  This won't be a 100% accurate animation since window contents generally don't scale uniformly across the whole viewport (typically it'll be an expanding middle portion and fixed sidebars or something).  The animations will be quick though, so I think that approximation will be good enough to get it to look good.  I won't get a chance to do much work on this over the next several weeks, but if I get something working that's decent, I'll post an update.  Thanks again!"

A couple of days ago I was drooling over /r/unixporn   And today I have something close to one myself.   Start with the ground and build up, while youre setting this all up it is a good idea to have another light window manager so you have some backup. I used xfce when I was setting up I3.  Start by installing it, simple enough. From there practice practice practice,  not in some cold regime but more like figuring out ways that the wm can help you in your everyday activities.  I3 has a very nice cheatsheet guide for hotkeys that you should familiarize yourself with.  Dotfiles is your friend and most people are pretty nice as well. Theres nothing wrong with borrowing and adapting whats already been done. Its what we're all about isn't it?  Look at unixporn and most will have links to configs.  Github has heaps of configurations and fonts and everything youd want, browse there too.  Put together what youd like from all these snippets and look at tutorials to set them up, then make them your own. All the while in your new window manager.  You'll be a pro by the time its all set up amd not only will it look amazing but also you'll be just as amazing at using it."

But the point is that you are hating against the people using it, not the distro.   Every distro can't live without its community, especially Arch, which stated itself as community driven whatever it means.  But, OK, you need arguments, so I leave some of them especially for your pleasure   Usage of systemd. Yes, it's a flaw. I can speak about this trough many hour, but instead of it, I'll leave you only a list of arguments against systemd, which you can't disagree I know, systemd can be removed from Arch, but libsystemd cannot. Annd all of repository packages are linked to them and support logind calls. Fake sense of modularity - you can install your own packages, but you are still forced in some cases (like I said before, init system for example) to use components chosen only by developers. Next example is when a lots of packages are linked to GTK3, when it's not necessary, because they have GTK2 build option. So, until GTK3 will be a piece of bloat (look at its dependency tail and compare that to GTK2) it seems to be a waste of our hardware resources. Poor quality of packages. Did you even looked trough AUR PKGBUILDs? They're a piece of crap, they have own hacky fetch functions, build functions and non-standarized post-extract routines. If you even see, for example, Void Linux source templates, you'll be shocked that it works, and it's WAY better organized than Arch repos. Still, CRUX ports are good examples too. Lack of common sense in dependencies - as I said before. Instead of making base package as minimal as possible, and give every possible binding/library as optional package, they (sometimes crazily) enable all of possible options diuring build, additionaly isolently lists  lot of 'recommended packages' at end of installation. Community loose their path. They meant to be elegant, but they transformed to something like ""Ubuntu foir a bit smarter kids"", cause all of those old users went into any of more sensible alternatives.   Enough now. If it doesn't convince you, nothing does.   And you are basing this statement on what? In fact, I welcome any constructive criticism.    I stated that because you've ignited a huge flame from little spark which was mine sentence about Arch users. It was said half-jokingly, but it had a bit of truth, and you know why, but you can't admit that, starting a nonsense shout instead of this.  And it's not a first time when you do it. Also here.  It's enough from me ATM, until you understood but everyone have a tight to state their own opinion until they don't insult anyone. And I haven't done that yet, trust me."
unixporn,37457m,hamsterslayer01,1 point,Sun May 24 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you're really that into the UNIX philosophy and that's the primary reason you don't use systemd, then I hope you're using hurd instead of linux, because it could be argued that monolithic kernels don't follow the UNIX philosophy either.   The UNIX philosophy is a great idea to follow, and something to strive for, but right now we're at a real crossroads in the FOSS world where we can keep our identity as users of a niche, abstract, tinkering, time-wasting, and in the end useless OS, or we can give up some of our values in order to make GNU/Linux or GNU/Hurd or whatever popular, so that more people want to use, develop, port, etc, for the platform.   Users don't give a shit about the UNIX philosophy. They want something that is relatively easy to customize to their liking, preferably something that is set up acceptably out of the box, and something that will run all of the programs they need, and that's about all they want or care about in the long run. Guys and girls that come here, like you and I and everyone else and people on /g/, etc, are the people who care about the UNIX philosophy and about what the OS can do and what it looks like under the hood and the how and why of its development and its implications on the future. But we're not a numerous species of dev/user.   Systemd is good because it's all of those things from the previous paragraph. It's big and easy and does its job and many more jobs, and out of that code complexity it really does simplify the user space, which is a good thing because if we get more programs like that then maybe more people are going to use Linux, and so more things will be written natively for Linux instead of having a proprietary WINE wrapper slapped over them and calling it ""Good Enough"". Besides, the only thing you lose by using OpenRC et. al. instead is Gnome3, which is a pile of dog shit anyway.   And finally, as far as compatibility goes, at least we're not BSD!"

unixporn,36rp0m,anderraso,4,Fri May 22 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"There is no such sub. Existing Windows customization subs are built around things like Rainmeter and little else. The community of Windows users who rice with the perspective of minimal WMs on a Unix-like system is very small. Also, it has become harder and harder to do with each new version of Windows. In my opinion, whatever small niche there used to be for this sort of Windows rice is fading quickly. We can either choose to completely disallow it or to leave the occasional Windows rice alone.  Obviously, the issue with the first option is that there will be no place to post Windows rice. Pretty much all Windows customization subs would be confused. Also, it's so uncommon that any new sub just for Windows rice would be doomed to death from the start. The problem with the second option is that we may start getting Windows posts that don't deserve to be here and belong elsewhere. There is a difference between installing a Rainmeter skin and replacing Explorer with an alternative shell, however that distinction may not always be clear to new posters.

I'm not sure where I stand regarding the banning the more generic things we see. Sure, I love looking at the bare minimal i3 setups, but it's nice to occasionally see both ends of the spectrum.

I like to think of it as art, and I feel like others do to; just because something doesn't take a dickload of effort doesn't mean it's not beautiful or not art.  I mean obviously, I don't think someone should just install mint and take a screenshot and post it, but I do enjoy seeing a range of customization all over the spectrum."

I tried even less with my current setup, it's just the default KDE5, I still have the default wallpaper. Does that mean my desktop is bad, no. It means that I haven't done anything to it.

I understand the argument that it's not UNIX, but I'm not sure we should use a name as the guideline here. Maybe the name is just not ideal (even if a name change is out of question). It certainly shouldn't become the majority and, of course, only covers actual riced setups.   Should general Linux beginner questions be moved to more relevant subs?   Yes. They don't belong here and especially the quality of those posts is usually miserable (i.e., titles such as ""Linux noob here need some help""). If it's about looks and ricing, post it. If it's about basic setup and the like, post it somewhere else.   Should we try banning certain popular elements for a limited time?   I'd love some reasoning for why anyone considers this helpful. This sub isn't exactly drowning in submissions, is it? I don't see how disallowing submissions during certain times will increase the posts of other topics during that time. Most people don't rice a new setup every day just to post it, but just rice their own system and share it.  This will only lead to a) people posting anyway, having their posts deleted and this will lead to frustration and b) if people follow the rule and don't post, they will post it the week after. Worst case, they just don't post it and /r/unixporn has lost a submission.   Should we turn off downvotes?   No. Downvotes are just as helpful as upvotes and I don't want this to become a ""all that counts is awsumnezz"" sub. As for spam-downvotes, this is an issue that needs to be tackled differently. How, I don't know. But please don't take away a valuable feedback system for everyone because of a few people.   A harder stance against sexism, racism, and abuse toward other users.    I'm for a stance as hard as it can get. We are not 4chan and shouldn't try to become one. All these things have no place here. Anyone can be a sexist racist anti-gay, that's their thing. But they should not be allowed to promote these things on here as it's irrelevant. Warn them, warn them, ban them.   ""Approve pomf.se as a host!""

It was fun to see nice screenshots from time to time. Even ugly ones, for which people were giving advices. Then ""rice"" appeared, and people started thinking that to make nixmen fap, you just need to match your terminal colors to your status bar. NO.

That's the kind of content I used to see there, and that I want to see again. But now it seems that only screenshots are encouraged and valid here. There are rules about hosting screenshots, naming screenshots, commenting screenshots, rating screeshots, ...

Questions specifically about UI/UX should exist here, even if they are technical details about configuring specific software. However, generic questions without design perspective probably would be better suited elsewhere. Banning submissions including popular elements seems like a bad idea. If you don't like a particular tiling window manager, lets say xmonad, then what are you doing here looking at i3, dwm, bspwm, awesome, monster, etc~ anyways? Yes they might be largely different internally, but aesthetically they can all look very similar regardless of which you pick. Did you not come here for screenshots? I also recall someone wanting to ban Solarized color palettes because they personally thought it was ugly or boring or simply tiring to see over-and-over again. This subreddit seems to constantly be balancing between software, aesthetics, and function - and to limit submissions including a trending element in any of those three areas will lead to an imbalance beyond simply having too many submissions of a trending element. Better to have than have-not. It is easier to skip over threads that indicate from either thumbnail or thread title than having whole threads non-existing because it included a popular item. Turning off downvotes sounds like a great idea - if it were actually possible. Hiding the downvote button isn't the same thing and doesn't seem like a good idea."

I wonder what the world would be like if Minix was allowed to be free software by Tanenbaum's publisher when Stallman first needed the Kernel, most likely Torvalds would've never even started on Linux, Minix would be integrated into the GNU and we could all laugh even more at Windows users because of our superior ultra stable microkernel design."

The term ""Linux"" has become super vague and prone to confusion with android into the picture now. No one knows what you mean any more.  For instance, Wikipedia's FreeBSD page contains this passage:   FreeBSD has similarities with Linux, with two major differences in scope and licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to Linux delivering a kernel and drivers only and relying on third-parties for system software   Okay, so the bolded Linux word links to a page which claims:   Linux (pronounced Listeni/ˈlɪnəks/ lin-uks[4][5] or, less frequently, /ˈlaɪnəks/ lyn-uks[5][6]) is a Unix-like and mostly POSIX-compliant[7] computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel   Directly contradicting the page linking to it in its first sentence.  That's dumb as fuck and obviously caused by the issue that the page it links to is about Linux as in ""GNU/Linux"", there's a second page on Wikpedia as well ""Linux Kernel"".  The page itself is not entirely clear itself when it refers with the term ""Linux"" to the kernel or the combination with the GNU Userland."

If I am using Firefox, Chrome or Chromium, I am not using a browser that's part of the GNU project. These are all very important components. I'd argue that at least my outward experience of using the system is shaped more by these components than either GNU or Linux.   Calling it GNU/Linux is cumbersome.

This has nothing to do with ""credit"", credit is a fool's errand and I don't get why people are so obsessed with it. This has to do with clear and unambiguous terminology so I can understand you. The word ""Linux"" has been lost in translation at this point, I don't know what it means. Use ""Linux Kernel"" and ""GNU/Linux"" to be specific.  You see countless times that people say ""My router uses Linux inside"" and then people assume that an entire software distribution composed of a kernel, a userland, a windowing server, a window manager, a desktop environment and you name it is some-how inside that little router.   Calling it Linux seems like the best choice to me. Sure, it is the kernel and not the operating system. I don't see why we can't distinguish between Linux the Kernel and Linux the Operating System without using the cumbersome GNU/Linux moniker.   Because everywhere you go people get confused. I point wikipedia as an example, they themselves get confused in all the mess, the terms aren't even used consistently in one article let alone across articles. It's often in sentences entirely ambiguous what meaning of the word is used.  Then there's the added complexity of android, which is a software distribution that uses the Linux Kernel but not the GNU userland and then you have  people endlessly debating if you can call android Linux, of course you technically can. But it gives people the wrong expression since they've come to expect the GNU userland delivered with the kernel at this point.  Clear terminology is essential to communication and the word ""Linux"" at this point has lost all clarity."

unixporn,369rt6,cirkelzaagopmnkutje,2,Mon May 18 08:21:46 2015 UTC,"And I was saying that I do NOT think GNU/Linux is the correct term for the OS. I explained why I think that in my earlier post.   you know that a graphical server is not, and has never been considered part of the OS right?  GUI's are newer than the term operating system, there are plenty of systems which don't run GUI's. Most servers and supercomputers do not run GUI's but still run OS'es.   If credit was not important to GNU   I never said it wasn't important to the GNU?  I am not the GNU? I said it wasn't important to me and my reasons. What does what the GNU think have to do with this discussion? THe GNU, in particular stallman, are self-obsessed dorks when it comes to this discussion, they're not interested in clarity, it's just a petty matter of recognition and Stallman's relentless terminology warfare to the point that it serves no purpose any more. Especially when they go rename actual brand names like ""Arch Linux"" to ""Arch GNU/Linux"" that's just ridiculous, it's an actual brand. I don't see why you can't name your software distro after just the kernel it uses rather than the entire OS it uses. However, on the Archwiki they are careful and tend to say that Archlinux is a software distribution using the GNU/Linux OS built atop the Linux Kernel, which is correct terminology.   The terminology is clear and unambiguous enough as it is. Linux the kernel and Linux the OS   Bullshit, just yet I was debating with someone who used rhetoric like ""Linux will take over the Desktop market, because it has already taken over everything else."" and that already shows the ambiguity and the play of words. What is said here is ""X/GNU/Linux is going to take over the desktop market, because the Linux Kernel has already taken over everything else."" that already makes absolutely no sense now does it?  The kernel used says very little about the usability of an end-user graphical desktop suite, but since the same name is used for both, you can easily play on words like that to make a fallacy.   GNU/Linux provides no extra clarity.   Of course it does, it differentiates the kernel from the popular combination of the kernel plugged into the GNU OS.   In fact, it creates the illusion that everything that is part of the Linux operating system that is not the kernel is GNU. This is obviously false.   I think you're mistaking the term operating system with ""software distribution"" here which obvious contains an OS, and a kernel, as one of its components.  X or KDE or whatever are absolutely not part of the ""operating system"", they are programs hosted by the operating system that are part of a software distribution. Again, the specifics in terminology is important. The idea that a graphical shell is part of an OS is mostly something that came into existence because Windows inseparably ties its GUI to its operating system statically and because Apple calls their software distribution ""Mac OS X"" while it is not an OS, it's a suite of software that runs atop an OS, the actual OS inside ""Mac OS X"" is called Darwin, it's Kernel is called XNU. So you got these analogeous things:   Ubuntu <-> Mac OS X Unity <-> Aqua Xorg <-> Quartz GNU/Linux <-> Darwin Linux (Kernel) <-> XNU   Anything above the line ""GNU/Linux <-> Darwin"" cannot rightfully be called part of the operating system any more because it performs no operations in that capacity. They are simple programs the OS runs, nothing more. The GNU userland is statically linked to the kernel in a variety of ways. Removing the GNU userland will stop the system from booting correctly, initiate a kernel panic at boot and fail to display a login prompt. Now obviously the kernel is modular enough to be linked to some userland and it needn't be the GNU. But it needs a userland, a kernel alone is not usable. It depends on certain programs to be there during the boot stage and those programs are required to operate the computer.  You cannot remove the GNU from the kernel without rebooting the system and re-imaging the drive for instance, you can easily uninstal xorg on a running system or install it. because Xorg runs inside the operating system as just another program.  Now, obviously some GNU utilities absolutely do not fit the above description, things like ""find"", ""locate"", ""ls"" etc are not part of the OS, they are simply programs the OS runs even though they are designed by the GNU and should not be included if you talk about the ""GNU/Linux"" OS, that's probably why GNU calls these ""utils"", which is what they are, utilities that are called by users rather than critical programs the kernel constantly calls itself during both its normal operations and its booting stage.  edit: Late edit but something I feel I should add. systemd/upstart/sysvinit etc are very much part of the operating system. The kernel expects an init process but none of these are GNU software. So the OS that the Arch Linux distro for instance runs should actually be called systemd/GNU/Linux, yes."

I'm pretty new to all of this, but I'm very eager to learn!  I use Left Alt as my $mod in i3, and I don't have a left Super key (Steelseries keyboard with a media key replacing it). It would be nice to have right Super be my XFCE modifier.  I'd also really like to know how to set up keyboard shortcuts in i3; it was super easy through the menus in XFCE.  Example: Super + m = redshift -O 3700 (for colour temp shifting - this is way better than f.lux ever was on Windows!)  Sorry if this post is overwhelming. I'm still recovering from the ""holy crap, I can do that?"" shock that many nerds experience after switching to Linux primary after years of Windows drudgery. Take your time responding, or tell me to RTFM if you'd like."
unixporn,369rt6,suchtie,1 point,Tue May 19 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"If you already have i3 setup with Xfce then I assume you already knew what to do. Just to reiterate, in the Session menu, set xfwm4 and xfdesktop to restart ""Never"", but keep Xfsettingsd and possibly xfce4-panel if you want it, and save the session upon logout only once. Not a very beautiful approach but it works well.  About hotkeys - i3 has a specific mod button that you're using with everything, but you don't have to use $mod if you want to set a hotkey in ~/.i3/config. But since you're still using Xfce it will probably be easier to use the Xfce settings' Keyboard menu's hotkey tab. You can easily set all the hotkeys you want to your liking there."

I'm using pure i3, and the XFCE settings don't affect it (it sure would be nice to have a GUI sometimes!) I have no idea how to get XFCE working with i3. Any good tutorials floating (tiling) around? :P"
unixporn,369rt6,suchtie,1 point,Tue May 19 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"You can have only one window manager - either i3, or xfwm4. You can't have xfwm4 window decorations but keep the tiling of i3. My suggestion is to tweak i3 colors so that they fit your GTK theme. This is my current setup, I tweaked it to fit Numix-DarkBlue for the most part. Used to have a different wallpaper, a GTK2 theme, and much thicker borders, as seen here.  Also, if you want useless but good-looking gaps like I do, you can install i3-gaps. Just backup your i3 config and remove i3, then install i3-gaps-git from the AUR (but it's still started with the ""i3"" command, which is why normal i3 and i3-gaps can't coexist). There's info on how to use the gaps on the github page.  Anyway, if you want to set this up correctly:   set everything up for normal Xfce usage, i.e. Xfce is started by the login manager (lightdm, slim...) login and check if Xfce works normally close all applications enter Xfce settings add an autostart entry for i3 in the autostart tab go to Session tab set the restart type of xfdesktop and xfwm4 to ""Never"" if you don't want to use the xfce4-panel, set it to Never as well, otherwise keep it as is remove all other apps that you don't want to have running after a shutdown/reboot/login, but only if you're sure that it's not needed keep Xfsettingsd or everything will break! save the session logout, then login again. Everything should work. Remember to disable i3bar in the i3 config if you want to use the xfce4-panel.   With this, Xfce is started, but Xfce then starts i3 instead of xfwm4."

unixporn,369vsi,cdbfoster,24,Sun May 17 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'm writing a window manager, and it's starting to look like something, so I thought I'd share.  The ideas behind this window manager are flexibility and extensibility.  All core components (window layout, window manager, window decorator, display server communicator, etc.), use an interface/implementation model such that implementations can be dropped-in as replacements for each other in order to change behavior.  What this means is that anyone can change the windowing paradigm, window management style, or anything else by re-implementing the appropriate interface.  In fact, the only X11-specific code (xcb, of course) is neatly contained in only two implementations (DisplayServer and InputListener implementations), which would allow for a (relatively) simple port to another display server.  The majority of the system doesn't know or care which server it's running on.  The current source can be found here.  I've got a long way to go, but when it's complete, the default implementations will sport all the usual goodies you can expect from your average window manager: tags, swappable layouts, floating layer, etc."

I would think the correlation you see is that tiling managers allow you to quickly organize windows so you can view multiple things at once easily and efficiently, and they are also quite customizable. Both of these things would lend themselves to programmers and web developers, many of which would be using VIM for a long time for various reasons.

Then I decided to give i3 a go, and 3 days after I could not go back.  Only using the keyboard is potentially way more efficient for developer-related tasks. With terminal-based clients (e.g. ncmpcpp, weechat, vim), I have everything together in a tmux pane organized the way I want to. They are usually highly-customizable, and you often end up with consistent keybindings (e.g. vim keybindings), so the whole workflow feels really smooth. Even my browser (qutebrowser, under active development) uses the same keybindings. Basically, if I feel that something takes me longer than it should, I simply tweak my configuration to improve my workflow (new i3 keybinding? extra vim function? etc.). That kind of thing is often harder to achieve with the usual GUI stuff.  Finally, all these CLI clients/libraries can be configured with their respective dotfiles, and that makes re-using your setup on different computers easy if you start versioning them."

unixporn,36a1qw,Jellicent,3,Mon May 18 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"urlserver.py  urlserver.py shortens links, which is pretty nifty given that ncurses breaks link detection when the link gets visually carried over to the next line.  For example: Let's assume www.duckduckgo.com would be visually carried into the next line, it could become something like this:  www.duckdu ckgo.com.   I don't know the technical details, but that makes the link unusable for most link detection in ncurses as far as I know.  urlserver.py takes the given link and creates a short link hosted under your localhost, which then redirects to the actual link.  Example from my chat logs:  13:49:11 ⎢ 6  thimoteus https://weechat.org/scripts/source/urlserver.py.html/ 13:49:11 ⎢ [ http://localhost.localdomain:58935/dk ]   urlbuf.py  urlbuf.py is a buffer that stores all the links you received in any of your open channels or queries for a session.

I remember reading about it when I first discovered it, since I think the default doesn't include a NSFW library.  Maybe you can find the libraries that are more likely to contain iffy sayings and delete or exclude them?  Edit:  from the man page: When  fortune  is  run  with no arguments it prints out a random epigram. Epigrams are divided into several categories, where each category is sub-divided into those which are potentially offensive and  those  which are not.  Fortunes are found in /usr/share/games/fortunes"

A Code of Honour: never approach a friend's girlfriend or wife with mischief as your goal.  There are too many women in the world to justify that sort of dishonourable behaviour.  Unless she's really attractive. A gentleman never strikes a lady with his hat on. A guy has to get fresh once in a while so a girl doesn't lose her confidence. A man always needs to remember one thing about a beautiful woman. Somewhere, somebody's tired of her. A man can have two, maybe three love affairs while he's married.  After that it's cheating. A pretty woman can do anything; an ugly woman must do everything. A woman can never be too rich or too thin. Beauty, brains, availability, personality; pick any two.   But you're too butthurt by the fact that I don't want any of these to show up on my desktop to actually notice how much these quotes make me roll my eyes.  lol downvote away, cool, you're just proving my point even more.

I already explained this earlier.  If you read my previous comment, I highlighted exactly what I felt was sexist about it.  And to a certain extent, yes this is my problem.  I wanted to figure out somewhere I could draw quotes from that weren't quite as, well, not funny, sexist, and overall stupid.  And while other users helped me figure out how to delete the quotes I didn't want, you seem to be set in your ways of telling me that I should just stop being offended.  that's not what I asked and you are in no way contributing to the conversation.  On the other hand, society's pretty fucked up for letting a package that ships on so many systems be so overtly sexist.  Go ahead, be as offensive as you want on your computer, don't make the default option for everyone to have quotes that are this fucked up.

The man page also says the following:   If a particular set of fortunes is particularly unwanted, there is an easy solution: delete the associated .dat file. This leaves the data intact, should the file later be wanted, but since fortune no longer finds the pointers file, it ignores the text file.   If that's too drastic a solution, I'd recommend creating a shell script called ""cleanfortune"" that caches the output of fortune in a variable, and only echoes that string to standard output if it doesn't contain words or phrases you find offensive. You can use echo and grep to handle filtering, and have the script loop back and run fortune again if it comes up with a bad fortune."

I was wondering if anybody had any good places to draw quotes from (i.e. an endpoint with a new quote of the day, etc) that weren't as terrible as the default fortune files.  Since there are a lot of desktops/etc with quotes on them here, I wondered if anybody had a good place to get them.  Since this is more about content than programming, /r/linuxquestions and /r/linux4noobs didn't seem like appropriate places (and I'm not a noob, I'm an industry-experienced dev).  I'm totally aware of your dank maymays. I used to think /r/tumblrinaction was hilarious until they just became straight up bullies.  As for the desktop, it's actually OS X + Aqua with Menu and Dockless w/ Ubersicht widgets, and I use Amethyst for tiling.  You should pretty easily be able to mimic it with any distro.  There are no particular artifacts of the DE in this setup (it's all just ubersicht and my background image).

This will input text in the top of the xfd window that will something like this (it should be below the ""next"" button):   character 0x00e03e   You will use this to echo your desired glyph/icon/what-have-you into your terminal (which will likely show up as a unicode rectangle because you don't have siji in your .Xresources) by doing this:  echo -e '\ue03e'    What you are doing here is having it echo the unicode character ""e03e"" into your terminal. You will copy/paste this unicode rectangle into your conky/lemonbar/dwm config and you should be rearing to go. (Make sure you have siji included in your conky fonts.)  Edit: It looks like you already are have it enabled with    ${font siji}   So I am guessing you would just drop the glyphs after it? You might have to play with it a little :D"

unixporn,35zjgm,hofnerd,1 point,Thu May 14 20:50:50 2015 UTC,I have to ask as stupid as it is. Where did you find that background?
unixporn,35zjgm,idtownie,2,Thu May 14 21:56:40 2015 UTC,http://www.fourletternerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/magic-the-gathering-game-wallpapers.jpg  It's easy to find people's wallpapers if you take the screenshots of their desktops and plug them into Google's search by image thingy.
unixporn,35zjgm,hofnerd,0,Thu May 14 22:11:28 2015 UTC,Thanks. I can never seem to find them myself. Maybe I should try the image search from Google.....

unixporn,35zqul,horst3180,1 point,Thu May 14 21:46:08 2015 UTC,Looks pretty awesome! How do you get these multiple running-dots? Are they a feature of the dash-to-dock extension?

unixporn,35wryk,DomThePorcupine,1 point,Thu May 14 04:15:38 2015 UTC,I think i see a hangouts icon there. Do you have a hangouts standalone app? Or is it just the one that comes with chrome? Thanks!
unixporn,35wryk,robochicken11,1 point,Thu May 14 14:57:09 2015 UTC,"Shell theme? That doesn't look like ozonOS'. Looks like paper, but I didn't know they had one?"
