WidescreenWallpaper,3dbd7m,Wingnut10,3,Tue Jul 14 23:22:03 2015 UTC,"Note: this will fit any 21:9 screen.. some people think that all these images have to exactly fit their monitor's native resolution, which is an incorrect assumption. My 3440x1440 Samsung displays this oversized image perfectly. A 34400x14400 image would fit just fine - but then you get into PPI, the original image quality etc.   The original image's quality counts the most of course, but you'd be surprised how many blurry 'hi-res' images there are out there......"

WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,motherlode1,2,Mon Jun 8 21:04:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this motherlode1 :)
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Wingnut10,2,Mon Jun 8 21:29:29 2015 UTC,"No worries mate, Here it is in uncompressed form.Link. The link goes to Dropbox where the images have been uploaded 1:1"
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Wingnut10,2,Mon Jun 8 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"I know what you're on about with Imgur... I can understand them wanting to save disk space, but the compression on some larger images is terrible. Also, imgur is really flakey posting albums with big images too.  FYI for any submitters: For single large files, that you can post directly in full uncompressed form, maybe use http://pomf.se/ as there is zero compression algorithms used. I've been sticking to roughly 5mb for very detailed stuff on this sub, mostly landscapes.  Flickr you can also use to directly link images here (they didn't in the past)."
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Wingnut10,3,Tue Jun 9 17:56:54 2015 UTC,Apparently imgur has an option in account settings that allow you to upload images with very little compression. I haven't done any tests on that so I cant really say for certain if its any good or if there is any difference. I will update this comment when I run a few comparisons.
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Wingnut10,3,Tue Jun 9 22:39:21 2015 UTC,No actually.. you're absolutely right there motherlode1. Just tested it and it seems to be rather good. I take it back about Imgur and thank you for your help.  I won't be able to update these images till the weekend alas. Expect lots of landscapes to be dumped in 'New' :)
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Wingnut10,3,Tue Jun 9 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"You are welcome man!. I am looking forward to those landscape dumps. I am a big fan of calm blue seas, open oceans, and something that basically has a boat in it, kinda like my current wallpaper. I hope you have some of those in your dump. I will be dumping some more walls in a few days to this dump (just sorting through them) so you can either have it hot linked or perma link it. Totally your call."
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Sheesho2000,3,Tue Jun 9 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"Me too.. nice unfussy stuff for me, but you have to cater for all tastes I suppose. Looking forward to your new posts :)  btw - this sub would appear to be at the top of a Google search around most of the world: '3440x1440 wallpaper' and '21:9 wallpaper' all come out on top (can people verify this?). I only started this sub because I was astonished that nowhere else was doing them, even a whole year after the first LG UM95 came out.  Mind you - posting your album on /r/pcgaming (or was it /r/pcmasterrace?) get's a lot of exposure."
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Wingnut10,2,Tue Jun 9 23:37:11 2015 UTC,I know what ya mean. I had to look real hard for these wallpapers. The other problem is 2560x1080 is really an odd resolution and not a lot of sites cater to it. Most of the wallpapers were custom edits anyways. I will link you some good sites that you can use for wallpapers.  1) Desktoppr  2) Wallpaperscraft   I have a few more. I will link them when I find their links.
WidescreenWallpaper,392spl,Sheesho2000,2,Tue Jun 9 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"I've been consciously not going to existing wallpaper sites. If I did, then they'd probably feel justified in nabbing all of these as well really. Perhaps not, but I was trying to be original in hit or miss kind of way."

WidescreenWallpaper,37y0lt,adnrew,3,Sun May 31 10:11:56 2015 UTC,"Ok. So I spent a bit of time making these wallpapers, and felt that the 21:9 ratio crop doesn't do the original of the wider shot justice. there's just too much detail that cant be seen. So I uploaded the original to my server if anyone wants to have a look. Take note the original is ~37mb and measures 11820x3566  That's Geralt on Roach on the bridge!"

For your 21:9 shots, maybe go up to 6880x2880 for some of them like we use here quite often, although some people won't realise that it will still fit their monitor."

WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,adnrew,4,Fri May 29 04:26:22 2015 UTC,These three wallpapers are excellent!!
WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,gonzogogo,3,Fri May 29 06:24:30 2015 UTC,Superb!!
WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,Wingnut10,3,Fri May 29 06:29:52 2015 UTC,the fire on the first one needs to be put on a more additive blending mode for light.
WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,blizard72,2,Fri May 29 21:39:56 2015 UTC,Btw: any chance you could post up your Kaer Tolde wallpaper album?
WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,Wingnut10,3,Sat May 30 19:48:07 2015 UTC,Yeah for sure.  When I get home from work :)   The full image is wider than 21:9  but it's a nicer shot too. I'll see about posting the full res somewhere.  Tis like.... 25000x10000
WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,Wingnut10,2,Sun May 31 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"Nice one adnrew :) I sometimes use http://pomf.se/ for very big images because it doesn't compress large images, unlike Imgur.  You can't make albums however."
WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,Wingnut10,2,Sun May 31 13:32:45 2015 UTC,oh awesome!  I tried uploading the full size photo to imgur and it shrunk and compressed it like crazy T_T Imgur must also do some heavy jpg compression...like 50% atleast. everything looks crispy as.
WidescreenWallpaper,37oltp,tdog3456,2,Sun May 31 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah - compression algorithms and colour subsampling. Pomf.se is great, especially for landscapes, but I do worry the site may go down forever as it's a small operation unlike Imgur :)"
WidescreenWallpaper,37nep6,thedonik,3,Thu May 28 22:32:09 2015 UTC,A really nice image - thanks for posting :)
WidescreenWallpaper,37nep6,Wingnut10,3,Thu May 28 22:52:11 2015 UTC,"No problem.  The more content for us wide screeners, the better :P  On that note, my buddy made this one to fit this resolution.  I should have more to come in a few days (he doesn't much use reddit)."

WidescreenWallpaper,37g1sp,theodric,3,Thu May 28 12:55:39 2015 UTC,Are you still having problems with it? It's fine on Windows 8 and my mobile phone. I could always upload the cropped .png or convert it to a tiff.
