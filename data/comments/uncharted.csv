uncharted,3e4916,AdilB101,2,Tue Jul 21 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of people trying to save it for the first experience, I've definitely become skeptical about movie trailers because they reveal WAY too much.   But, I also trust Naughty Dog's judgment, and their past mistakes have always been learning experiences for them. (i.e. the cargo plane sequence being in all of the promo material for U3)"
uncharted,3e4916,Qirex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched any videos for Uncharted 4 except for the first gameplay footage last year. I try to watch as little footage or trailers for games I am interested in, and so far I have found it very rewarding."

uncharted,3dzpj1,Eddynstain,4,Mon Jul 20 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"If you look at Nate's animation and a lot of the snow falling down, you can tell it's just interpolated footage of regular U2. Can't say it didn't fool me at first, but the longer I watched the more I could tell."
uncharted,3dzpj1,Qirex,4,Tue Jul 21 06:42:07 2015 UTC,It's 100% fake. The pistol icon is different than the one shown in the previous gameplay.
uncharted,3dzpj1,SolidFlyTrap,3,Tue Jul 21 07:05:45 2015 UTC,is it legit?
uncharted,3dzpj1,hokagenaruto,5,Mon Jul 20 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"It certainly looks like its running much smoother, but I can't say I see any difference in lighting and textures. It's been a quick minute since I've played U2, but I'm not seeing a difference here."
uncharted,3dzpj1,ASIWYFA,3,Mon Jul 20 23:43:44 2015 UTC,thanks. yea i couldn't tell either.
uncharted,3dzpj1,hokagenaruto,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"It's fake as someone pointed out below the weapon icons are different, also the weapons are a lot less shinny and not as reflective as seen in the recent demo, and if you watch closely at the screen where drake picks up the treasure you can the options button is just stuck over the start button because it's just slightly sticking out from underneath."
uncharted,3dzpj1,dukenukemserious,2,Tue Jul 21 07:48:22 2015 UTC,Couldn't really tell much of a difference aside from the frame rate..  If only it had multi-player
uncharted,3dzpj1,FallenAng3l_94,2,Tue Jul 21 04:08:41 2015 UTC,"As someone who just started playing it over again last week I did not see much difference,"
uncharted,3dzpj1,fifty8th,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"This proves that the cutscenes were rerendered, one fact that hadn't been confirmed yet."

uncharted,3dqmq8,OriginalPostSearcher,2,Sat Jul 18 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"I wish the PS4 was backward compatible. When my PS3 inevitably dies it'd be a great excuse to upgrade and still make use of my PS3 library. I really want to play UC4, but honestly that's the only game that draws me to the PS4, and I can't spring for that."

uncharted,3dnwb0,TheJoshider10,7,Fri Jul 17 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"At the time I thought using the motion controls for logs and grenades was fun. Didn't have too much trouble with either myself and the combat never got too hectic where it hindered my ability to use grenades in the heat of battle. However if it was still required in U2 it would have been hell, especially in multiplayer."
uncharted,3dnwb0,Zook024,2,Fri Jul 17 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"I never played the first game so I can't comment, but I hated the tacky touch screen shit in Golden Abyss. The only good thing about it was when you pencilled on items to show details. I wouldn't mind something similar for the touch pad."
uncharted,3dnwb0,morphinapg,3,Fri Jul 17 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"Thank god. Those were so stupid.   I like the idea of motion controls, but they have to be optional, and they have to be implemented well. For example I thought the optional motion control gliding in the Batman games was done well, as was the motion control flying in Warhawk. There was also a baseball game on ps3 that did motion control swinging which I thought was really fun.  Curious about the new difficulty though. I hope it isn't required for the platinum. Crushing was hard enough in UC1. It would be welcome in 2 and 3 though."
uncharted,3dnwb0,morphinapg,4,Sat Jul 18 00:00:20 2015 UTC,I think it will be included for the Platinum. The trophy for it may replace one of the MP ones since that's not in any of the games.
uncharted,3dnwb0,morphinapg,3,Sat Jul 18 00:01:46 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. The added difficulty on The Last of Us Remastered was implemented as DLC trophies.
uncharted,3dnwb0,morphinapg,3,Sat Jul 18 00:03:22 2015 UTC,But this difficulty has been confirmed for the base game.
uncharted,3dnwb0,TheZooBoy,2,Sat Jul 18 00:08:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the added difficulty in The Last of Us Remastered was also included as part of the base game as well. The trophies simply treated it as if it were DLC, but it wasn't."
uncharted,3dnwb0,SolidFlyTrap,2,Sat Jul 18 00:14:05 2015 UTC,Ah shit you're right. Been too long since I played that. Did that difficulty have its own separate DLC or was it tied to one of the MP ones? Because if it had its own Grounded DLC trophies it could be done here as well.
uncharted,3dnwb0,Pighast,3,Sat Jul 18 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"It had its own Grounded DLC trophies, not tied to any other DLC."
uncharted,3dnwb0,KarmaLoaf,3,Sat Jul 18 05:28:56 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to play the new difficulty! And thank god the motion controls were removed. The log never bothered me, but I never used grenades in Uncharted 1 because they were so annoying."

uncharted,3df50d,ThePreciseClimber,6,Thu Jul 16 16:49:22 2015 UTC,How do we know it's not just some guy who upscaled the resolution to 720p and converted to 60 fps? See how it looks pretty blurry for a 1080p video?
uncharted,3df50d,MasterKingdomKey,3,Thu Jul 16 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that's all it is, still nice to see though."
uncharted,3df50d,kacboy,2,Thu Jul 16 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"Going from 720p to 1080p upscaled is perfectly possible.  But you can't convert something from 30 to 60 FPS. Not without re-rendering everything. So this is, officially, gameplay of Nathan Drake Collection.  The only piece of 60 FPS uncharted gameplay that ever came out on the internet, was the piece from Uncharted 3 on the desert."

uncharted,3df50d,GatorGalore,3,Fri Jul 17 15:58:45 2015 UTC,I would've liked to see them pull a Metro: Redux and retool the hud and controls to resemble U4. That way each game would play the same.

uncharted,3dec3a,GatorGalore,2,Wed Jul 15 22:28:51 2015 UTC,I updated the front to have a better face for the situation.
uncharted,3dec3a,GatorGalore,2,Thu Jul 16 00:57:13 2015 UTC,That looks much better!
uncharted,3dec3a,MasterKingdomKey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"Nice, but the face is photoshopped onto the original. Also, in the information the words are sometimes apart or close together"
uncharted,3df71f,andrerebel,3,Wed Jul 15 20:11:37 2015 UTC,"The 2013 Tomb Raider is a good one to go to if you're looking for a similar feel to Uncharted. It's more of a serious action-adventure, though. Also, The Last of Us is done by Naughty Dog, the same company that made Uncharted. Very serious narrative, though. Prepare to cry at points."
uncharted,3df71f,ninjapino,4,Wed Jul 15 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yea, the whole reason I started Uncharted was because someone recommended it to me after I beat Tomb Raider. I'll check out The Last of Us! THanks!"

uncharted,3d1t2d,AdamMcwadam,8,Sun Jul 12 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"What would be the point to copying and pasting what was good about UC2? The PS4 allows so much more potential, possible set pieces and ideas they had for Uncharted 2 but couldn't pull off? I think its a bit too quick to judge."

uncharted,3d1t2d,kdeveuve,2,Mon Jul 13 06:05:33 2015 UTC,I can see that. Maybe that section was just faster paced than others?  TBH it had me on the edge of my seat.
uncharted,3d1t2d,zackmanze,-6,Sun Jul 12 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe that section was just faster paced than others?   Even the earliest of the gameplay, where drake is swinging from the cliff and stuff, it looked like doing too many things. The whole vibe from the videos has been that of a project which has been on doing things 'intensively' rather than creatively.  But from the responses here till now, it seems the majority fans are fine with what they have seen. People with my perspective prolly arent too many :)"

I've explained my reasoning for creating the MP sub before so I won't go over it again but it does seem like its a little premature.   I'll leave the sub there for now because make the sub private but hopefully there will be enough people to warrant it later - perhaps once the beta comes out.  I would say we should post all content in this sub again.  Oh well, at least the sub got a redesign out of it! :)"

uncharted,3cmi9z,CategoryIV,19,Thu Jul 9 01:41:59 2015 UTC,This is like going to a car dealership and asking if their cars are better or the one across the street.
uncharted,3cmi9z,ginsunuva,4,Thu Jul 9 03:46:29 2015 UTC,Agreed. Posting this in the Uncharted sub seems a bit silly as a lot of people in the Uncharted sub probably don't even own an Xbone.

uncharted,3cmi9z,Border_Dog,6,Thu Jul 9 08:04:55 2015 UTC,"After that extended E3 2015 demo, I have to say Uncharted 4: A Thief's End takes the cake. That was incredible!"
uncharted,3cmi9z,stevyjohny,7,Thu Jul 9 01:42:52 2015 UTC,"The Uncharted demo was a lot more exciting than the Siberian gameplay in Tomb Raider.   I've never liked the comparisons between the two games though. Tomb Raider used to be mostly adventure, puzzle and platforming. It was rather light on action with the exception of Legends. Everything changed with the last reboot. Uncharted has always been much more heavily action focused. Of course, because of the tomb raider reboot they look more similar than ever.   But go compare Uncharted 1 to Tomb Raider Anniversary (they actually came out the exact same year). Anniversary was a remake of Tomb Raider 1. The two games could not be any more different. Anniversary is completely about puzzles and platforming. The only thing you shoot are animals.   I've always liked Tomb Raider. I wish that they did a reboot that was more in line with what they traditionally did rather than go the Uncharted route."
uncharted,3cmi9z,TheJoshider10,2,Thu Jul 9 05:05:26 2015 UTC,"You're right and bring up good points. The Tomb Raider reboot (which I loved) did stray a bit from it's roots. It reinvented itself in a way, for a more action oriented audience. That in turn made it seem similar to the Uncharted series for which action and set pieces are at the forefront.  We see this with many game, where the further along they get, the impacted they are by the ""action black hole"" as I call it. The ""action"" genre, however loosely defined, seems to pull in many franchises due to its wide spread appeal. Consider the first two Dead Space games, relative to the third. The third being much more action oriented than the others.  I'm an action game fan, so I argue this is for better or worse. However, Uncharted does what it does so well, it would be wise for Tomb Raider to stick to what it does (did?) well, which is puzzles, tombs and exploration. What do you guys think?"
uncharted,3cmi9z,Swarley133,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:56:14 2015 UTC,"Nah I think the reboot worked well and copying a successful format was probably needed to make sure it took off well. I hope they can build on the gameplay by also going more in line with their roots, so as the games go on and as Lara truly becomes Tomb Raider, the more similar to the older games they get."
uncharted,3cmi9z,stevyjohny,2,Thu Jul 9 15:20:20 2015 UTC,Uncharted. Although I am really excited for Rise of the Tomb Raider as well.
uncharted,3cmi9z,kokopelli73,2,Thu Jul 9 02:22:27 2015 UTC,I had to go watch Rise of the Tomb Raider to see for myself. I didn't even know another one is in the works.   The Siberian gameplay didn't look that great to me. But the short trailer at the end looked very good. There were a lot of interesting locations. The environments looked great as well.   I'm still more excited for Uncharted because I think the story will be more interesting. Naughty Dog games have a way with complete captivation from start to finish.   I'm aware that Tomb Raider has more gameplay elements like upgrades and such but don't forget Uncharted always has a first rate cast. I feel like that always gets overlooked when compared to the new Tomb Raider games.   There just aren't any games besides Uncharted and the last of us which so seamlessly blend video games and movie style entertainment.
uncharted,3cmi9z,AlexxJoshee,2,Thu Jul 9 04:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Uncharted more so, for sure, but I also definitely look forward to TR."
uncharted,3cmi9z,stevyjohny,2,Thu Jul 9 05:25:17 2015 UTC,Uncharted 4 : A Thief's End.   When Uncharted : Drake's Fortune was announced people called it 'Dude Raider'. Now the Tomb Raider series draws 'inspiration' from the Uncharted series...
uncharted,3cmi9z,ketsugi,3,Thu Jul 9 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, Tomb Raider was looking a lot like Uncharted last time around. But it's not just Tomb Raider. Other games have tried to emulate Uncharted. COD games started to have more and more of those big scripted events.   I feel like Uncharted still nails it though as they strive to allow the user more control during these events."

My favorite game series, so I definitely won't miss out on the chance to play them at 1080p. The low resolution is one of the things that has kept me from replaying them since I got my ps4 for the most part (although I did just recently play 3 in 3D since the collection won't have that and I hadn't done it before)"
uncharted,3cier0,morphinapg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:57:08 2015 UTC,"Nice. I didn't know pre-order was already available. I was surprised that the collection is coming out so soon.

uncharted,3cier0,morphinapg,2,Wed Jul 8 12:04:26 2015 UTC,"They did say there will be some visual upgrades but I can't imagine it would be much. Sort of like TLOUR. Better models, textures, shadows, and apparently something done to the lighting (although I couldn't tell on that)   I expect them to fix some of the issues on Uncharted 1's controls though, and obviously fix the tearing problem and probably give them better AA (at least for Uncharted 3)"
uncharted,3cier0,vane2266,3,Wed Jul 8 12:28:01 2015 UTC,I'm planning on getting it...simply because i've not played any of the games as i used to be a 360 owner...i watched the walkthroughs of all 3 games a few years ago when uc4 was first revealed. I've forgotten most of the amazing set pieces and story details so i'm sure the ND collection will be great for me.
uncharted,3cier0,R2_D2aneel_Olivaw,2,Wed Jul 8 09:19:34 2015 UTC,Yes. If it's half as good as the MCC was on Xbox one it will be worth it. Playing the original Halo as if it were a current game was awesome. I never really play multi-player anymore so I didn't care about those problems.

uncharted,3c5q14,w0odyallen,3,Sun Jul 5 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"This is the result of 2 things.   PPI - Press release screenshots will sometimes need to be used in print, print typically uses a 300 PPI (pixels per inch) versus screen resolution of 72 PPI. So the PS4 has a resolution output (for uncharted 4) of 1920x1080 at 72 PPI which is what you see in the video screenshots. If you want this same quality in print at 300 PPI the resolution would have to be rendered out at 8000x4500, now I'm not saying that they render out pictures at this high quality but they will be higher than 1920x1080 and then sized down for online viewing but probably kept that that high resolution for print. Compression/Appearance - Like you said this could also be the result of compression as video compression even at high bit rate can be damaging on the image. I believe though this is a combination of that and also making the game look the best in that situation for a still image rather than moving. A really good example of this are these two images 1 2. The image from the game and the effects that have been added are not good for print, combine that with the compression of the video and it makes the game look not that good looking. All they did in that situation is make the resolution larger, turn off the motion blur and take a still rather than a screenshot from video. Just to show you how bad compression can make something look I've added motion blur and compressed the shit out of the press image link. Looks kind of similar to the video screenshot don't it?   I think those 2 tricks all game developers use to make the game look the best it can in print, the worst offenders are ones who add things into screenshots that simply cannot happen in the game engine for example Assassins Creed: Rogue so much bullshit going on in that screenshot, that game is meant to be running on the 360 and PS3, yea right."
uncharted,3c5q14,odj310388,2,Sun Jul 5 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"No one else is saying it so I might as well. There are some effects missing during gameplay. Compare this one to this one. Look at the water.

uncharted,3c5q14,stevyjohny,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that the cut scenes are per-rendered and will look slightly better than the game. However, I downloaded the recent extended footage video is full 1080p. It's almost 2 gigs.   After watching it, I think the graphics are definitely great. The part where Drake is trapped under the jeep after the catch is an up close shot. Graphically, it looks amazing. Since it is obviously a gameplay moment, it's not pre-rendered graphics.  I still think that there will be some pre-rendered video, but I think the gap is smaller than last time. And for me, Uncharted 3 seemed to have the biggest difference between the cut scenes and the gameplay.  I also think that some parts of the environment look better than others in the gameplay, which I think causes disconnect between the gameplay not looking as good as the cut scenes. It's just my opinion though. I thought the same things about the older Uncharted's. Some levels looked better than others for example. In Uncharted 3, the castle level was the worst in my opinion graphically. The Markets in yemen looked great as well as the desert villages.   Either way, I wouldn't worry that much about 4. It's already surpassed the last games graphically. The gameplay looks better than the per-rendered cut scenes in the last games. I think that is probably the goal anyway. But as long as there are cut scenes, I suppose there will always be a temptation to max out the graphics, while not being able to do the same for the actual game play."

Even the aliasing and lighting appear different. not to mention certain camera angles deliberately framed for better composition. If I were to guess, Naughty Dog rendered the scenes at higher resolution with all their bells and whistles with all their settings on ""ultra"" and then damsampled to 1080 to produce the beauty you call ""Game""."

Her (presumed) husband lied about his location and his participation in this new treasure hunt. Plus, I'd rather have a multi-dimensional character, not just one who is smiling and happy in every situation. I love Nate and Elena's banter as much as the next person, but I accept that it's situational."
uncharted,3bzdxt,Yoshiboots,2,Fri Jul 3 12:51:54 2015 UTC,I think she's always sad now because she knows Drake is constantly in danger.
uncharted,3bzdxt,NBThunderbolt,3,Fri Jul 3 12:57:16 2015 UTC,Because Drake is a goof who keeps leaving her behind.
uncharted,3bzdxt,kacboy,2,Fri Jul 3 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"Kinda answered your own question there. She matured. The time gap between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves has to be a good couple of years, giving her more than enough time to, well, I don't wana say get TIRED of Drake, but yeah. And it didn't help much that he was banging Chloe at the time aswell. Pretty much everywhere he goes chaos follows. Gunfire, crashing buildings, yeti-like creatures, plane crashes... the list goes on. I would think that after Drake's Deception she was looking foward to a quiet life of little to no ""adventuring"". Which clearly isn't going to stop anytime soon"
uncharted,3bzdxt,zombiecon146,2,Fri Jul 3 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"That's bothered me as well. In Drakes Fortune, it was Nate who wanted to quit because it was too dangerous and Elena wanted to keep exploring. I hope she doesn't get sidelined in this game."
uncharted,3bzdxt,DARDAN0S,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Nate didn't want to quit, he wanted her to."

I think it was just a closed off old, abandoned, ruined building in the area that they were in. Also a bit of trickery by Naughty Dog to make it a surprise opening into a bright bustling town from what you think is a dark underground location."

uncharted,3bs92r,will-dearborn,27,Wed Jul 1 19:00:19 2015 UTC,I've been waiting for this just to see Elena. The character models are just so impressive.
uncharted,3bs92r,Yoshiboots,12,Wed Jul 1 19:38:06 2015 UTC,At 14:17. The detail on the face is absolutely ridiculous.
uncharted,3bs92r,joaolx,12,Wed Jul 1 19:43:48 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad her face hasn't changed too much. Sully and Nate show clear signs of aging, but not Elena. Was worried her face would look too different but thankfully she more or less looks the same. Would love to see a comparison.   edit: comparison here: https://i.imgur.com/kIeFtBp.jpg  Mad how different she actually does look, but for some reason she always looked like that to me."
uncharted,3bs92r,TheJoshider10,9,Wed Jul 1 19:54:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think she looks that different. I actually think she looks better while still being much more realistic. Besides that comparison is not a good one. Her expression in the 4th one is very different than the others as well as the angle.   While I understand that you think she looks very different, if you notice closely her face structure is basically the same in all the four except she doesn't look as ""flat"" since there is a lot more detail. If anything this is her true look and I think she looks great."
uncharted,3bs92r,joaolx,6,Wed Jul 1 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"For sure, the same happened in Arkham Knight where the last gen games look more cartoonish whereas they made the models more realistic due to the new tech. This is essentially a more realistic looking Elena, and it's great she looks like this as Sully and Nate despite looking more realistic also look a bit different, which makes sense due to the ages they're meant to be showing plus the realism."
uncharted,3bs92r,TheJoshider10,10,Wed Jul 1 20:08:48 2015 UTC,She looks amazing! The facial expression are impressive. I've been waiting to see her and Chloe. Now I'll just wait for Chloe.
uncharted,3bs92r,dagrock,9,Wed Jul 1 20:08:32 2015 UTC,I hope Chloe is in the game.
uncharted,3bs92r,TheJoshider10,9,Wed Jul 1 20:09:39 2015 UTC,And Cutter...even if just for a cameo...
uncharted,3bs92r,fuzzyfoot88,2,Wed Jul 1 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"I wish. But I remember Graham McTavish stating (either early last year or late 2013) that he had no involvement with any current ND project. Of course that's exactly what Nolan North said, but still I wouldn't get my hopes up."
uncharted,3bs92r,GatorGalore,6,Wed Jul 1 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure she will. She has to.  Also I read somewhere ""I hope they don't kill Elena"" now I can't shake that thoguht. I really like her so much."
uncharted,3bs92r,dagrock,4,Wed Jul 1 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"No fuck off no killing off Elena. Honestly the worst I can see them doing is killing off Sully, maybe as a way to stop Nate adventuring once and for all. I just want them all to live happy though:("
uncharted,3bs92r,TheJoshider10,7,Wed Jul 1 20:18:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, killing Elena is borderline disrespectful at this point.  They have spent 3 soon to be 4 games building their relationship.  They've been up and down, married and separated, Nate's even been punched legit by her.  They wouldn't throw that away now unless it was the biggest decision Nate had to make in the end.  I see Sam having to save either Elena or Nate at the end and Nate will tell him to choose Elena."
uncharted,3bs92r,fuzzyfoot88,3,Wed Jul 1 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"Oh shit that would be brutal. I can't have Nate die at the end. I could imagine that same scenario but with Nate choosing brother or lover, or lover and Sully."
uncharted,3bs92r,TheJoshider10,3,Wed Jul 1 20:27:13 2015 UTC,Ikr? I recently played Uncharted 3 for the first time and SPOILER:  and and then I was so relief when it didn't really happen.  But seriously. They can't kill anyone. I love Nate+Elena relationship so much.
uncharted,3bs92r,dagrock,6,Wed Jul 1 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"My favorite thing about their relationship is actually in 3 to be honest.  The beautiful moment when Drake realized which ring really meant the world to him...and it wasn't the one around his neck, it was the one that was honestly given to him by the woman he loved."
uncharted,3bs92r,fuzzyfoot88,4,Thu Jul 2 07:25:48 2015 UTC,"I think they all look a little jarring at first, especially since they're both upgraded and older. After awhile, though, my brain just tricks me into thinking they've always looked like that."
uncharted,3bs92r,Yoshiboots,4,Wed Jul 1 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Her face is much more easier to see as always looking like that. I'm still adjusting to Nate and Sully, personally."
uncharted,3bs92r,TheJoshider10,5,Wed Jul 1 20:09:23 2015 UTC,That's kind of how I felt when I first saw her picture in U4. It looked like the original Elena but next-gen and a bit older.
uncharted,3bs92r,joaolx,2,Wed Jul 1 20:09:35 2015 UTC,I thought the same when I first saw next gen screenshots of Nathan Drake. Think we'll get used to it fairly quickly.
uncharted,3bs92r,AutoMasta,2,Thu Jul 2 00:03:38 2015 UTC,"The thing is whenever I see Drake in the Uncharted 4 gameplay I always picture the normal face. It's only when we go up close I remember he has a more wrinkly, realistic face."

uncharted,3bs92r,corben22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:15:58 2015 UTC,Her character model is still nice (I'm glad they got rid of the flat strips of hair) but they made her sort of look like Ellie now.

There's a slight break in her voice when she begins talking, almost as if she were crying recently.   You can practically hear the heartbreak and disappointment in her voice"
uncharted,3bs92r,cjn13,3,Wed Jul 1 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"TBH anything would have been better than how Elana looked in UC3. She looked so fake and plastic, like a different character almost."

uncharted,3bv3ra,SugarHey,9,Thu Jul 2 11:57:13 2015 UTC,"E3 has ended, but the team is still working on improving the  gameplay included in the demo. For instace, a developer has noticed that  the speedometer of the Jeep was at zero during the demo. The demo isnât an early level, but itâs a little later, after the player has already gotten used to the mechanics. Itâs not accurate that the game is getting darker because the team behind The Last of Us is working on it. The series is just maturing, but the theme is still adventurous and bombastic. The jeep is something Naughty Dog wanted to do in the Uncharted series for a while, and it overlaps a lot with other mechanics in the game, like the rope. The team looked at the game and picked up the appropriate slice of  gameplay for E3, according to the fact that it can show the best  features of the game in little time, with the right pacing and  without needing too much setup. The demo is one of the craziest parts of the game, and itâs the  current benchmark for the number of opbjects on the screen and  destructibility. Naughty Dog hasnât decided how long the game will be, bit feels the biggest Uncharted they ever made. The multiplayer beta will be exclusive to those who will buy the Nathan Drake Collection. Sam Drake is âmuch more Drakeâs equalâ than any other character in  the game, as heâs similar to him and has the same skills and knowledge.  The chemistry between voice actors is great. Single Player will run at 30 frames per second. It was the best  solution for the gameplay and quality, and Naughty Dog wanted to have  the best looking game possible, with the best graphics and phisics  possible. Framerate has to be considered against everything else in the  game, and the developers feel that locked, stable 30 FPS is better than  variable 60. On top of that, higher frame rate would require even more  optimization for every level, inflating the time it takes for each to  get made and requiring the team to make more compromises. Multiplayer still targets 60 frames per second, and the team canât wait to show it off. The team learned from The Last of Us to create more open  levels, and core mechanics influencing the interaction between  characters, to make them come out as more alive. Having an Arabic language localization is a priority for the team, but itâs not known if itâll actually be in, for now. The rope has been implemented because itâs a perfectly natural evolution, and an extension of the fluidity of Unchartedâs  gameplay. Very little of it was shown so far, but itâs a big part of  the game and itâs gonna be used a lot. Itâs the most realistic rope  Newman has ever seen. It can pin on a ledge and create a swing point.  The spin point can also physically slide. Nathan Drake is physically enabled almost all the time, and a lot of  ragdoll physics have been added to him. Thereâs a lot of âcrazy new  techâ going on with him. The team wanted to make him as responsive as  possible to the stick, but still look like a person reacting  realistically (but in a slightly over-the-top cinematic way) to  situations. There are different animations for slightly lover cover positions,  to which Drake can automatically switch as the cover becomes lower (for  instance the deflating bags). Thereâs going to be a photo mode in the game, and the team is going to improve it from the one we saw in The Last of Us."

uncharted,3bs8sg,patinthehat7,-3,Wed Jul 1 20:35:08 2015 UTC,This game is obviously going to score 10s across the board BUT I do think modern gaming audiences these days want more from their video games than 5 hours of exciting but empty thrills and spills (hence the current immense popularity of open-world sandbox games).    Why pay the same amount of money for a game made by people who spent 4 years building enormous beautifully detailed environments only for you to then zip past everything in a 5 minute set-piece when you could get a game for the same amount of money that lets you wander around similar enormous beautifully detailed environments and spend hours exploring every detail and nuance the world has to offer.   Uncharted is an outdated concept that'll serve as a wonderful visual showcase as it always has but it doesn't belong on the modern video-gaming landscape anymore especially because it doesn't seem to have any plans of adapting to modern tastes and becoming more than just a playable action movie.
uncharted,3bs8sg,random-relay,2,Thu Jul 2 08:41:33 2015 UTC,"That's a really short sighted way of looking at games. People play different games because they offer different  experiences; trying to equate a dollar value to that is misguided.  It's like saying ""Why are you reading Moby Dick?

uncharted,3bsmj9,zhacob,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:24:58 2015 UTC,"My view is that Sam's character has been drastically rewritten following Amy Hennig's departure. From the original teaser it's clear he had a villainous role, but Neil and Bruce probably wanted to do something different with him, therefore he was changed from an antagonist to a 'good guy'. Who knows though. And I personally think Sam is going to be the one to survive the game, with Nate being killed off."
uncharted,3bsmj9,GatorGalore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:14:41 2015 UTC,"I thought everything Hennig wrote was scrapped? If that's the case, I don't think they kept anything."
uncharted,3bsmj9,stevyjohny,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:13:42 2015 UTC,"They surely did, as the reveal trailer we got way back in November 2013 showed us a map of Africa, stopping at Madagascar where the sentence 'for god and liberty' is written, the motto of Libertatia.   Todd Stashwick, the actor behind the voice-over from the trailer was also confirmed to have been playing Troy Baker's character Sam before he left the project.   By this point Amy is gone and Neil and Bruce jump in, completely(potentially) rewriting the entire script, while keeping some elements like Avery's fortune and Drake's brother but drastically altering the story, including Sam's character, to the point where the eight months of mo-cap work that Nolan has mentioned have effectively become obsolete."

The idea of Nolan North and Troy Baker together properly (I say properly because whilst David was great I don't think their characters ever met in TLOU and Nolan didn't voice himself as much as say you can clearly hear both Troy and Nolan in their Uncharted characters) is brilliant and I can't wait.  However, naturally as we haven't spent 3 games with him, the attachment to him isn't there. Not sure how they'll give him depth or make us love him as a character, but we'll see. I'm looking forward to it either way,"

However, I thought Uncharted 3 seemed stale. I don't want all of the Uncharted games to have the same tone. I want them to be a little different.   Amy's approach was very light hearted. She always envisioned adventurous stories with not so serious character developments.   I feel like in Uncharted 3, we were supposed to get more back story, which we did. But I still never really felt like we knew that much more about any of the characters. They just explained how Drake met Sully.   Now that they are bringing in Drake's brother for Uncharted 4, I hope this game is more personalized than previous ones."

uncharted,3b8vsm,Endyrith,3,Sat Jun 27 19:37:13 2015 UTC,I just got a ps4 and it came with the game which I just started playing for the first time. Theres so much world building with in the first 30 minutes that I don't think they'll be able to fit it all in 2h-2Â½hrs
uncharted,3b8vsm,WhelmedB01,4,Sat Jun 27 19:40:42 2015 UTC,He would be a great nathan drake but he said that he was not interested and to be fair who can blame him this movie gets worse and worse every week
uncharted,3b8vsm,messengerofevil,3,Sat Jun 27 13:30:31 2015 UTC,"I wanted a movie awhile ago before news broke about Uncharted 4. Now, I don't care that much anymore. We are getting a real Uncharted game again.   Also, everything I have heard about the Uncharted moves sounds like pure incompetence. First, they wanted to make it about Drake being some kind of underground art thief and Sully was the uncle or something. Just stupid. Then they wanted Mark Walhberg. Then after that they tried to get Seth Rogen to write a script and he said that he had no idea how to do it. Just ridiculous.  The Uncharted games would actually be incredibly easy, compared to other games, to make into a movie because they're already so movie like. But a movie transition still has to be done with care and from someone who actually played the games, if they ended up making a movie on the games. If that's the case, I imagine they would start with the first one. In any case, the director has to decide what gets left out from the games. There is more than enough action material to work with. They have to decide what can be duplicated on screen.  I always thought that a movie could start with Uncharted 1, being mostly the same as the game. They could do the beginning sequence with everything up until Sully gets ""shot"". Then do the plane crash. Have the jeep escape be somewhere in the middle of the movie. They could cut out the jet ski stuff. A lot of the second half of uncharted was fighting various swat guys in courtyards. That could all be cut out.  So i actually think there is an opportunity to make a cool movie version of Uncharted. I just haven't seen anyone who would actually do it right."

uncharted,3b8vsm,AdilB101,4,Sun Jun 28 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you.  I'll be honest though, back when U2 came out I was all over the possibilities of seeing an Uncharted film.  I wanted anything Drake that I could get my hands on.  When U3 came out and they sort of finished the story by tying the idea of letting go and appreciating what truly matters through the use giving up Drake's ring for Elena's wedding ring, I was content that that was it.  I didn't need a film, or an U4, or anything else.  It felt finished.  Anything else outside of Naughty Dog's direction would most likely sully the great name.  And here we are with U4 and I couldn't be happier.  I have zero interest in an Uncharted film.  If I want to experience Uncharted in a timely fashion, I play them on Very Easy.  I get to see the film-like nature of the narrative and guide the hero through the story without all the difficulty or trophy hunting."

uncharted,3b1wrh,ThatGuy743,3,Thu Jun 25 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Neil Druckmann is directly involved with The Last of Us' movie adaptation. He's actually writing the script and casting for the film.  I have no doubt that it'll be a fantastic movie, especially since it draws most from Cormac McCarthy books and his biggest inspirations made the movie adaptations and they were brilliant.  As it stands, though Uncharted has been around and talked about as a movie property for way longer, The Last of Us movie is MUCH further-along. Neil wants this movie to be made, I think it's best we let him create. Especially since Uncharted isn't happening at all at this rate, and I'd expect it to be a childish Indy Jones ripoff anyway with the lack of creative input coming from someone that understands the property.  Also, bringing Sam Raimi on to direct/consult/something (I can't remember the exact title but who cares? he's directly involved now as well) was a fantastic idea.  Really, at this point Uncharted's movie isn't happening. The Last of Us is a completely different property and it's much further-along in the process of being made.   The extent of Uncharted's process has been those leaked e-mails that marked moments from other movies to copy straight from."

You've got potentially good news here, however: with the XBOX ONE initiating backwards-compatibility, many people think it's only a matter of time before the PS4 gets the same status. If they don't jump on that bandwagon, they could lose a lot of potential customers.  Also, if you're really worried about it, the first 3 games are being re-released in an HD format for the PS4, so you can at least have all those games again if you do end up biting the bullet and buying a PS4. Which I think you should, it's a wonderful system."

Of course he is likely just pulling our legs. But maybe he isn't. Nate already got a happy ending, at the end of all three previous games. He got a second chance at his marriage with Elena in UC3. EXTENDED E3 DEMO SPOILER:  That means either Elena will be killed (This could also be the 'controversial' ending), or it will truly be A Thief's End for Nate. He could go off in a blaze of glory, saving his friends and ultimately redeeming his relationship with Elena, but at the cost of his life."

uncharted,3ad0qe,chofortu,12,Fri Jun 19 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"I would like to say, off the bat, that it was easily the most impressive thing I saw at the whole conference. I assume you guys know what happens? Basically it's the public video, except it doesn't end when Drake hooks onto the crane. He smashes through the wooden posts, then avoids some passing boats and things as he continues dangling, getting to the other side of the bridge.  Then, he's dragged through some mud for a while behind the crane. The player is in control, and shoots some bad guys. Eventually he makes it up to the truck and there's a familiar rhythm of shooting guys, then jumping to a new vehicle as yours explodes.  Drake eventually makes it to a jeep, which he uses to ram the remaining few motorcyclists chasing his brother, Sam. Drake catches up to him and they both say ""Get in!"" at the same time. They argue, Drake's car is smashed into, and he ends up in the upside-down car as it starts to burn.  Drake pulls himself out of the car (the animation and attention to detail here is insane, with Drake bracing himself against the steering wheel, and then the wheel turns. Then he braces himself against the gear stick, which wiggles realistically too. Really cool) and shoots some guys. Then he's about to be shot by the big gun truck, when Sam pulls up on his bike and Drake hops on.  The next sequence is what really blew me away - Sam drives and Drake shoots. It reminds me of the part in UC2 where you run away from the gun truck as it chases you down some stairs, but it's like that cranked up to 11. The camera keeps pulling closer to the duo as the truck closes in (the cinematography here and in general is phenomenal) and I don't know whether it was that, or the music, or the voice acting or what, but it was unbearably intense.  Then yeah, the truck explodes as the bike power slides under an HGV, and Drake and Sam have a giggle then ride off while the dock workers or whatever look on with confusion.  Then there's a little extra scene where Sam and Drake meet up with Sully who's like ""oh cool you're alive ok"" and then Sam's all ""there's a big communal pirate colony where they shared treasure and put it all in one big pile"" and Sully is like ""where is this communist pirate utopia"" and then Drake points at some islands and says ""they're near X"" where X is some fake-sounding place name.  Then they walk inside a motel and Elena is there and she's like ""oh wow so I guess the Malaysia mission didn't go well????"" all passive-aggressive. The end. She literally has one line before it cuts to black."
uncharted,3ad0qe,I_the_Lionheart,3,Fri Jun 19 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"If you had to speculate, at what point in the game's story do you think the scene is taking place?"
uncharted,3ad0qe,I_the_Lionheart,3,Fri Jun 19 04:57:24 2015 UTC,"Probably fairly early - the only new character is Sam (although there's clearly some threat since Nate is killing all these bad guys). My impression is that Nate was living a peaceful life with Elena, and then heard that Sam was in trouble with whoever owns the bad guys. So, he lies to Elena that he's just going on some peaceful trip to Malaysia for some reason, and heads out with Sully to save Sam. The final cutscene of the demo had so much exposition from Sam that sets up everyone's motivations (about the pirate community, and the treasure etc) that I would be surprised if it were more than like 20% into the game. Probably more like 5-10%."

uncharted,3ad0qe,Bethorz,3,Fri Jun 19 05:27:04 2015 UTC,Apparently this demo had good mud physics? Don't suppose you could go into detail with that?
uncharted,3ad0qe,fuzzyfoot88,5,Fri Jun 19 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"This is probably referring to when Drake is being dragged through the mud while he hangs onto a rope attached to a truck. I mean, there isn't really anything in the way of ""mud physics"" that I remember - there was some particle system of mud being splattered around, and Drake left trails in the mud which were presumably displacement and/or bump maps. Also, predictably, Drake got covered in mud while he was sliding around.  I guess the way that Drake was actually sliding around on the mud was pretty cool - he was gradually reeling himself in, occasionally stopping to shoot at the bad guys. Really, the gameplay in the mud section was more impressive than the graphical side of things."

uncharted,3acb81,furiousHamblin,15,Thu Jun 18 23:05:45 2015 UTC,If only we could watch it. I'm always hesitant to trust or even read articles like this just in case it doesn't live up to the hype later on. Knowing Uncharted I'm still confident tho
uncharted,3acb81,-Chibz,6,Thu Jun 18 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"I watched it, and it was absolutely incredible. Like... I don't know, it's a logical progression for Uncharted and Naughty Dog, but it's one thing to predict that it would be this good, and quite another to actually see it in action."
uncharted,3acb81,chofortu,4,Fri Jun 19 03:23:45 2015 UTC,I don't want to watch it. I know Uncharted 4 will be amazing. I want to be suprised by what's in it when I play it.
uncharted,3acb81,ThatGuy743,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:03:39 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, from people who have seen previous Uncharted E3 demos, Naughty Dog does a really good job at completely changing up the action from the demo to the final game -- The E3 2011 demo video of Uncharted 3 on the cruise ship ( https://youtu.be/Z99qgk7jfgM ) ended up very different in the final game.

It's gonna be awesome, sure, but if it was so mind-blowing and better than the first half why wouldn't they show it on stage?"
uncharted,3acb81,elpedro84,3,Fri Jun 19 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"Because they want the press to write articles like this, and they want fans to be clamoring for a chance to play it.

uncharted,3a6mtg,SD456,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:45:19 2015 UTC,That driving sequence was insane but my immediate thought was is it going to be an insta kill if you don't take those turns? Like how much freedom will you really have with the vehicles? With the series' history of driving sections I'm worried it will still be mostly a scripted segment in the sense that if you go too slow or take the wrong turn you  will get blown up or whatever.
uncharted,3a6mtg,Zook024,2,Thu Jun 18 03:23:12 2015 UTC,The way it looked. You could take any path you wanted as long as it lead to the bridge.

uncharted,3a64rm,AlexxJoshee,2,Wed Jun 17 16:35:47 2015 UTC,Well Neil Druckmann is the writer and     he did say they are giving more importance to the story and relationships between the characters and toned down action.
uncharted,3a64rm,AlexxJoshee,5,Wed Jun 17 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't worry about that, he was talking about very specific things in terms of toned down action, and uncharted has always been about the relationships between the characters, i think that's one of its strong points.  in addition, they've mentioned several times that they know what makes uncharted what it is, and that's not going to change for this installment.   ""Uncharted is a completely different franchise, and appeals to its audience for completely different reasons,"" said Wells. ""I don't think The Last of Us marks a new direction in tone that all of our future games are going to take on. We'd alienate a lot of our Uncharted fans. We want to keep it a light-hearted romp. I think from a technical standpoint we've learned some things from The Last of Us that will feed into Uncharted - in fact, it strengthens our desire to keep them distinct."""

I planned not to watch any gameplay demos after the pre-release Uncharted 3 demos spoiled all the best parts (the burning chateau, sinking ship, and crashing plane were all shown prior to release as the main gameplay demos, and that was the three biggest setpieces in the game).  As soon as the PSX demo and E3 demo hit I watched them. I couldn't resist.

The gameplay I saw really satisfied my appetite. I was excited for the MGSV trailer and was looking forward to it the most. I nearly forgot about Uncharted but man, was it a pleasant experience to receive that we did.   Be patient, I'm sure a direct feed of the extended demo will be released within the month."
uncharted,3a9c9r,A_CanisDirus,3,Thu Jun 18 13:43:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, maybe it's less FUCK THE GAMERZ and more HEY LET'S GIVE THE PRESS AN EXCLUSIVE SO THEY CONTINUE TO GIVE US PUBLICITY!  Chill, and learn to be patient. The game is still going to end up in your hands, just relax."
uncharted,3a9c9r,WillRogers9000,2,Thu Jun 18 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"I think you probably just need to chill and be patient and they will share it like they are with metal gear solid.  The trailer we did see was amazing, and we have some more to look forward to."
uncharted,3a9c9r,FreddyBushBoy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:07:07 2015 UTC,"They don't want to spoil the game for the gamers but they want to get the press excited about the game, if the press is excited and constantly talking about how awesome it was, then players will be excited to buy it.  If players see it, they may actually be less interested in buying the game because much of it was spoiled already.  I personally wish I hadn't watched the one during the conference, and hope I don't see the extended version until the game comes out, I wish I hadn't listened to a synopsis of it."

uncharted,3a2ej1,kacboy,18,Tue Jun 16 18:18:14 2015 UTC,So glad they seemed to kind of make her more like she was in UC1-2. She looked off in UC3 to the point of me not liking her when she's been my favorite character.
uncharted,3a2ej1,Wose15,0,Tue Jun 16 19:14:09 2015 UTC,I don't think she looks like any of them

uncharted,3a2ej1,GatorGalore,9,Wed Jun 17 02:47:40 2015 UTC,Didn't notice it before but Elena looks a little bit more realistic in the first photo that the second and even slightly than to the third
uncharted,3a2ej1,Rocr,5,Tue Jun 16 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like they went back to the base UC2 designs for Nate, Sully and Elena this time. I think it's great."
uncharted,3a2ej1,jleopard,8,Tue Jun 16 20:35:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I thought that UC3 was a bit too cartoon-y when compared with UC2"
uncharted,3a2ej1,majima,2,Tue Jun 16 21:54:46 2015 UTC,I think she looks a lot more like Emily Rose this time.
uncharted,3a2ej1,Crimson27418,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:58:39 2015 UTC,really? I think they've totally moved away from making them look alike. Not sure if I'm sad or happy about that....I still want Emily Rose for the movie (but I know it totally wont happen..)

uncharted,3a54w7,GatorGalore,2,Wed Jun 17 14:04:37 2015 UTC,I just want them to announce the collector's edition so I can finally pre-order the game. I'd expect it to be very special as it's the final game.
uncharted,3a54w7,Packersrule123,2,Wed Jun 17 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"Ooh maybe a soundtrack, a steelbook, and something specific to drake. Like I think they did the ring, right? Something like that. Also nice tlou username :)"

uncharted,3a3cil,z_2013,3,Wed Jun 17 00:42:24 2015 UTC,Madagascar! If you look above the jeeps license plate it has there flag. Also the license plate it's self upside down seems to spell Elena!
uncharted,3a3cil,z_2013,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:57:51 2015 UTC,"thanks for the info man! they probably gonna reveal the name one day, but it is nice to known is something based on Madagascar because they are changing the continents where they are situated, in uncharted 2 i think it was Himalayas, im not entire sure, if im not wrong ... they are changing from something located in Asia to something located close to Africa. This is nice, it is a small detail, but it shows how ""global"" uncharted franchise is , and this is one of the aspects i like the most in the series ... i mean ""the last of us"" is cool and it is from the same guys behind uncharted but the game doesnt have that aspect , anyway it is shame UE4 - TEnd is rumoured to be the last from the series, im gonna miss this game."
uncharted,3a3cil,AntiForm30,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:42:16 2015 UTC,I love to see it in that neck of the woods too! Also i'm sad to say that it's not a rumor this is the last game. The hardest part to move on from is the characters. I hope we see a lot of Elena and Sully in the game and Nate's brother doesn't hog to much of the spotlight.
uncharted,3a0v6p,JadedDarkness,21,Tue Jun 16 10:18:39 2015 UTC,Elena looks absolutely amazing. Nate looks so life like in images #1 and #5. I'm surprised by the size of the environments. At first I figured it was a high quality backdrop.
uncharted,3a0v6p,jawwyploo,17,Tue Jun 16 10:44:30 2015 UTC,These are gorgeous. Elena looks amazing! Everyone's been aged wonderfully. The environments are amazing.  I feel like you can tell they've added what they learnt from The Last of Us to this game.  Thanks for the upload!
uncharted,3a0v6p,watterpotson,16,Tue Jun 16 12:10:27 2015 UTC,"I'm glad Elena is in the game, but for the love of God, let Elena and Drake still be together at the beginning of the game. No more of this ""we broke up"" crap that they pulled with 2 and 3."
uncharted,3a0v6p,Johansenburg,13,Tue Jun 16 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever seen more realistic faces. That is amazing, pre-rendered or not."

uncharted,3a0v6p,GatorGalore,11,Tue Jun 16 16:18:26 2015 UTC,Don't have a PS4. Will have a PS4. This game is worth at least that.
uncharted,3a0v6p,Irishane,8,Tue Jun 16 14:31:59 2015 UTC,As will be the 1-3 remakes. Get them. Play them. Love them!
uncharted,3a0v6p,gman311,9,Tue Jun 16 17:57:39 2015 UTC,Now they need to announce/show Chloe and Cutter please
uncharted,3a0v6p,Yosonimbored,8,Tue Jun 16 14:59:49 2015 UTC,These screenshots look like they are from an unreleased trailer. You'd think they'd save Elena for a story trailer. Looks awesome though.
uncharted,3a0v6p,BeauL83,8,Tue Jun 16 12:06:36 2015 UTC,Elena <3
uncharted,3a0v6p,kacboy,8,Tue Jun 16 16:28:37 2015 UTC,Sully's gotten so old now and Elena looks amazing these are really incredible
uncharted,3a0v6p,TooLazyForThisWorld,5,Tue Jun 16 18:00:23 2015 UTC,holy crap! When did they release these? I thought we would to wait until the next trailer to see an Elena picture.
uncharted,3a0v6p,stevyjohny,7,Tue Jun 16 11:38:07 2015 UTC,I think these are from the extended e3 demo from the show floor.
uncharted,3a0v6p,morphinapg,6,Tue Jun 16 13:52:22 2015 UTC,This may be off topic but does anyone know how old Sully will be in this game?
uncharted,3a0v6p,Brxy77,5,Tue Jun 16 14:05:05 2015 UTC,About 63.
uncharted,3a0v6p,GatorGalore,3,Tue Jun 16 16:21:32 2015 UTC,Seriously looking forward to this game.  I bought my PS4 on launch day back in November 2013 just for this and inFamous: Second Son.  The wait will be worth it.
uncharted,3a0v6p,emperorpopeatine,5,Tue Jun 16 19:17:19 2015 UTC,Can't wait...

uncharted,3a2fvz,TooLazyForThisWorld,2,Tue Jun 16 18:27:19 2015 UTC,Well in my opinion if it doesn't matter that much to you about a themed console I would just go ahead and order because a themed PS4 is cool and all but it doesn't affect the game experience.
uncharted,3a2fvz,cooperran,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"Good point, thank you.  A themed console would look really cool though"
uncharted,3a2fvz,Ciocana,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"Waiting is usually the best option. As you wait, more deals can come about and bundle themselves with ps plus and controllers and cheaper prices so personally I'd wait. It's your money though so do as you will.  Also it's very possible to download the games off of a friend's console, but you HAVE to make sure it's a different account with your credit card info so it's charged to your account and you can get it on your console when you put your account onto your new PS4."
uncharted,3a2fvz,Ciocana,2,Tue Jun 16 19:40:20 2015 UTC,Thank you very much I think I'll wait for a bit longer so. Just to clarify I understand the games will download to my account but will the background theme and the multiplayer beta also download to my account or would they go to my friends PS4
uncharted,3a2fvz,gohan-kun,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:53:55 2015 UTC,They should show up on your download list and email once you get your ps4
uncharted,39zt01,kacboy,16,Tue Jun 16 02:56:14 2015 UTC,My expectations were completely blown away
uncharted,39zt01,SolidFlyTrap,11,Tue Jun 16 03:08:57 2015 UTC,Incredible. It looks absolutely insane. I was expecting the introduction of drivable vehicles during this demo because of a news article from a few days ago. I kind of think that wasn't meant to get out before E3 though.
uncharted,39zt01,GatorGalore,2,Tue Jun 16 03:14:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I read the same thing like an hour before the stream. Still a great feature to see though.
uncharted,39zt01,AdamMcwadam,10,Tue Jun 16 03:33:30 2015 UTC,Something tells me the level sizes are a little bit bigger than Uncharted 3 \â¢0â¢/
uncharted,39zt01,HowieGaming,6,Tue Jun 16 03:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just a tiiiiiiny bit bigger lol :D"
uncharted,39zt01,Kholdie,3,Tue Jun 16 04:35:41 2015 UTC,"God, this is gorgeous. I'm really surprised!"
uncharted,39zt01,majima,5,Tue Jun 16 03:32:10 2015 UTC,90% of me believes that the driving section won't be as open as I would like to have it to be. It will be scripted and you'll have to turn into linear paths fast enough or you'll be met with a gameover screen.  Sad there was no Elena today. That would have made my day.
uncharted,39zt01,BlueBlur8,11,Tue Jun 16 03:13:08 2015 UTC,"Looked to me like there were 2-3 different roads you could pick at certain parts, though I'm sure they all converge to the same points."

uncharted,39ztt9,TooLazyForThisWorld,5,Tue Jun 16 18:15:07 2015 UTC,IMO he looks more real. I always thought Sully had something uncanny-valley about his look.

uncharted,39ztt9,GatorGalore,2,Tue Jun 16 03:05:40 2015 UTC,It definitely looks kind of like that to me. I like the character designs this game so far.
uncharted,39ztt9,vaena,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:13:24 2015 UTC,Right? Nate's aged and Sully's found the fountain of youth.
uncharted,39ztt9,oorheza,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:31:25 2015 UTC,"My favorite Sully was from Uncharted 2, I didn't like Uncharted 3's as much because he had a bobble head which is funny because I think the Uncharted 3 Drake is the best looking Drake. With that said, Uncharted 4's Sully looks properly aged and overall better then Uncharted 3's."
uncharted,39ztt9,TwoTecs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:08:50 2015 UTC,I liked the more Robert DeNiro Sully
uncharted,39ztt9,majima,-2,Wed Jun 17 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"I'm so scared to see what they're going to do with Elena's face this time around. You know, assuming she's in the game and its not a Troy Baker/Nolan North circlejerk."

uncharted,39ztt9,morphinapg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:59:42 2015 UTC,Devs should not mess with iconic video game characters we love. They think they're making them look better but in reality they're making them look like completely different people.
uncharted,39ztt9,morphinapg,4,Tue Jun 16 03:21:30 2015 UTC,Thankfully the actors help make it solidly feel like the same person.
uncharted,39ztt9,morphinapg,3,Tue Jun 16 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"Also, there's actually a really good reason they changed the faces for this one. They're using facial motion capture now, so the faces need to be closer in proportion to the actor's faces for the face capture to work best."
uncharted,39ztt9,ThatGuy743,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:11:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? I thought Naughty Dog said they'd stick to hand-keyed animations for the faces. I remember in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqgKtVNb4XU he said they wouldn't be using facial motion cap."

uncharted,3a0047,jimmymorrison,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:45:17 2015 UTC,Note the second half contains story spoilers they said
uncharted,39z59c,kacboy,22,Mon Jun 15 23:36:03 2015 UTC,I thought it was cool that they included the feature where Nate zones out and stands there thinking of all the things he'd rather be doing than getting shot at and falling off things.   All jokes aside that was pretty damn cool looking.
uncharted,39z59c,cdawgtv2,13,Tue Jun 16 02:37:07 2015 UTC,"My God I've been saying it since the 2nd game, ""I hope someday they do a car chase."" Tonight my dreams were answered. Thank you Naughty Dog, just... thank you."
uncharted,39z59c,WhyNotNick,5,Tue Jun 16 02:36:18 2015 UTC,Don't they do a car chase in every game?
uncharted,39z59c,morphinapg,8,Tue Jun 16 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, but you are kinda on a track. Fighting on top of cars and trucks and riding horses is awesome, don't get me wrong but to actually get to drive the car or vehicle or horse in the chase and decide how you want to take the chase; that is what I wanted. Correct me if I am wrong but it looked like there were multiple paths they could have taken."
uncharted,39z59c,WhyNotNick,3,Tue Jun 16 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"There absolutely were multiple paths. Look at the other Uncharted 4 demo too, same thing. It's going to be a game changer for this one. Tomb Raider and The Last of Us had a little of that too, but this looks like it's stepping it up a notch."
uncharted,39z59c,morphinapg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:47:30 2015 UTC,"Well, there were two at the absolute least: the truck's path and Nate's path. I'd bet there's more side roads following the main route, too."
uncharted,39z59c,cdawgtv2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:02:22 2015 UTC,"It definitely looked like there was more than one way down. I bet it narrows it the end, forcing you to drive around the construction site. However, it still looks awesome. This kind of sequence has been done many times in games before, but they usually don't give the player enough options. In this video, it looked like you had two different pathways to choose from whenever you needed one."
uncharted,39z59c,stevyjohny,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:10:07 2015 UTC,I saw an interview after the sony conference on the youtube live stream with some naughty dog people. They made it sound like all the multiple paths converge on the tower. So you might not even have to go by the construction site.
uncharted,39z59c,zachzombie,11,Wed Jun 17 15:22:01 2015 UTC,Unkarted confirmed
uncharted,39z59c,AntiForm30,4,Tue Jun 16 02:38:22 2015 UTC,Never thought of it like that! Dreams do come true!
uncharted,39z59c,stevyjohny,12,Tue Jun 16 02:53:50 2015 UTC,It was classic Uncharted. I like how heavy the punches are. It's a lot like the last of us.   I also like there is so much more stuff in the environment that gets shot up and knocked over. Punching that guy through the wooden gate was amazing!
uncharted,39z59c,stevyjohny,2,Tue Jun 16 03:03:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seemed like every piece of cover had limited protection. This will really force the player to keep moving, unlike previous entries."
uncharted,39z59c,ifeelwitty,5,Tue Jun 16 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"It seemed very similar to the other ones, but with more things blowing up like you would expect them to. I remember in U2 hiding behind the couch from turret Helicopter fire.....that definitely will not work in this game."
uncharted,39z59c,mootek,12,Tue Jun 16 10:07:05 2015 UTC,"Well, that car chase scene was intense. And I know I'm going to die 100 times before the end of it, too.   Won't care - because Nate and Sully are back."
uncharted,39z59c,JamesL1224,4,Tue Jun 16 02:36:46 2015 UTC,Very excited to see what Sony's got for us tonight.
uncharted,39z59c,TheFourGuy,4,Tue Jun 16 00:37:17 2015 UTC,I was blown away. The level of detail on show here is amazing. The short clip and image of Drake getting dragged through the mud by a truck hanging on to his whip reminded me of the scene in the first Indiana Jones film! I have complete and utter faith in Naughty Dog. One of my most anticipated games!

uncharted,3a1piv,Pkwlsn,7,Tue Jun 16 21:13:18 2015 UTC,Is that an ancient Tibetan ritual dagger in your pocket?
uncharted,3a1piv,emperorpopeatine,9,Tue Jun 16 16:06:45 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm just happy to see new footage.
uncharted,39v2gb,-OrangeLightning4,12,Mon Jun 15 01:09:24 2015 UTC,Should've included Golden Abyss as well.
uncharted,39v2gb,ThatGuy743,3,Mon Jun 15 13:17:36 2015 UTC,"I think they avoided calling it the definitive collection or anything like that because it certainly isn't definitive.  Although, as much as I would've loved to see Golden Abyss be included, I wonder if it isn't included because Sony still see it as a way to sell Vitas."
uncharted,39v2gb,emperorpopeatine,2,Mon Jun 15 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of this, I'm off to go get enlightened."
uncharted,39v2gb,MadPilotMurdock,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:09:35 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if the game will for sure be $60? Seems a little high to me. Especially since I already own the first three. I'd feel better at $40.
uncharted,39rr67,Salute_The_Bud,19,Sun Jun 14 02:59:14 2015 UTC,It's been an honour everyone...
uncharted,39rr67,Machienzo,13,Sun Jun 14 09:44:32 2015 UTC,Let's hope it's the conclusion our Nate deserves.
uncharted,39rr67,JadedDarkness,8,Sun Jun 14 09:22:11 2015 UTC,I believe North does think it is the last one. But I'm gonna take this article with a massive pinch of salt. There's no direct quotes from Nolan North (in fact there's no direct quotes from him at all in this) or Naughty Dog about this being the last Uncharted.   I'll believe it when I hear it from a Naughty Dog source directly.
uncharted,39rr67,LFCMick,2,Sun Jun 14 16:56:05 2015 UTC,Could also be a long con from all sides
uncharted,39rr67,morphinapg,3,Sun Jun 14 22:34:36 2015 UTC,Site seems sketchy... son

uncharted,39rr67,AdilB101,3,Sun Jun 14 23:33:00 2015 UTC,No kart racing game to conclude?
uncharted,39rr67,DEVILneverCRIES,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe Uncharted 5 will be a different protagonist. Or it could be another prequel. It could be the last Uncharted game with Drake or in a chronological order. However, this article seems sketchy. And there are no direct quotes from anyone at ND. or Nolan himself."
uncharted,39rr67,Machienzo,0,Mon Jun 15 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"He said it'll be the last uncharted game. Seriously though, it's the right time. I'm super excited to see where ND goes next. If anything,  I'm more excited about what's next than I am UC4."
uncharted,39rr67,DEVILneverCRIES,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:17:47 2015 UTC,New IP or TLOU I think.
uncharted,39rr67,Machienzo,4,Sun Jun 14 10:19:48 2015 UTC,Hopefully new IP. I loved TLoU but I think they've told that story masterfully and should let it be. I'd actually like to see them do something completely different. Maybe even a  fantasy or space setting. Or they could go Western like Rockstar did with Read Dead.
uncharted,39qbag,AlexxJoshee,11,Sat Jun 13 18:41:12 2015 UTC,I personally like Nate's Theme 2.0 however I can't really notice too big a difference between 2.0 and 3.0
uncharted,39qbag,ThatFuckingTurnip,3,Sat Jun 13 19:55:31 2015 UTC,Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgcq_ZtqbO0
uncharted,39qbag,kacboy,3,Sat Jun 13 21:09:00 2015 UTC,I always liked 2.0 the most.  The same goes for the rest of Uncharted 2's soundtrack; the game just holds the most nostalgia for me as it came at a specific point in my life where things were bad and the game was a much needed escape.
uncharted,39qbag,emperorpopeatine,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"Theme as in game theme, like dark, gritty etc. If so then Uncharted four very Last of us esc."
uncharted,39qbag,HAZ4THEWIN,2,Sat Jun 13 19:16:21 2015 UTC,I'm sorry if I wasn't clear before. I meant the soundtrack. ð

uncharted,39qbag,GatorGalore,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:30:53 2015 UTC,2.0 for me. 3.0 just doesn't sound right.
uncharted,39nhfl,GatorGalore,5,Sat Jun 13 00:28:10 2015 UTC,what happened to drake's signature belt buckle in the new game?
uncharted,39nhfl,Craiken,3,Sat Jun 13 03:44:05 2015 UTC,Grew out of it.

uncharted,39nhfl,Rab_Legend,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:22:42 2015 UTC,Please tell me that's not the actual cover for UC4...
uncharted,39nhfl,Crucial_Bullets,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:31:00 2015 UTC,It is. What's wrong with it?
uncharted,39nhfl,Crucial_Bullets,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"It looks really lazy, considering we saw Drake in a pose like that from a previous image and they decided to use the same one except with a different background."
uncharted,39nhfl,Zook024,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:55:20 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they reuse it? It's the main key art for the game. I see it just as an update of the older art.
uncharted,39n4l8,redlights5309,8,Fri Jun 12 22:42:48 2015 UTC,It's 3-4 years after Uncharted 3. I wouldn't worry.
uncharted,39n4l8,ThatGuy743,5,Fri Jun 12 22:47:12 2015 UTC,I'm not worried; I actually hope that's the case. Seeing an older and wiser Drake would be a great direction for the story to take.
uncharted,39n4l8,avw94,5,Fri Jun 12 23:59:42 2015 UTC,"Tom Cruise is 52 and look at what he gets up to, Keanu Reeves is 50, seen the movie ""John Wick""?..... being 38 isn't ""old"" these days, don't worry :)"

uncharted,39m1a9,fifty8th,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:06:31 2015 UTC,I'm going on about 10 minutes right now; I'll try deleting the game data if this doesn't work. Thanks!
uncharted,39fjhw,HowieGaming,14,Thu Jun 11 11:27:23 2015 UTC,"How good the writing is in the story, contrasted with the typical, unrealistic, ridiculous amount of people you're tasked with killing in a standard video game.  I know Lazaravitch pointed it out in the end of UC2, but... it still happens.  I don't know what the solution is; the gameplay is fun, the story is great. But something in the back of my mind says that when your game is this incredible in all other aspects, maybe try to find another element to the core of it all other than just killing hundreds of people--  But then it wouldn't be Uncharted. I dunno. It's a minor criticism, but it's there."
uncharted,39fjhw,doug,6,Thu Jun 11 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"I hate that drake has killed 400+ people. It's the stupidest part of the game. You kill so many of the same people over and over too that it makes the lives not matter at all. More puzzles, more exploring, more climbing. stealth sneak, and incapacitate.  Drake should be having nightmares constantly and PTSD."
uncharted,39fjhw,SRSLY_GUYS_SRSLY,22,Thu Jun 11 20:57:25 2015 UTC,I am really easily scared. So mine would be the monsters that are in the games ;_;  Currently playing U2 and fuck those fucking piece of shit monsters holy shit
uncharted,39fjhw,JP4R,28,Thu Jun 11 13:04:03 2015 UTC,U1 was the worst for those haha.
uncharted,39fjhw,fifty8th,18,Thu Jun 11 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"I agree U1's monsters were the scariest, U2's were hard to kill but not as scary. U1's are scary to the point I don't want to replay again even thought I loved the game."
uncharted,39fjhw,mgshowtime22,2,Thu Jun 11 21:08:06 2015 UTC,They were hard until you got a crossbow. After that it was OHKO

uncharted,39fjhw,ginsunuva,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:39:40 2015 UTC,The first surprise one in the ice cave was effing scary cause you had a weak pistol and no clear way of knowing what to do
uncharted,39fjhw,LNA-Big_D,2,Mon Jun 22 01:54:37 2015 UTC,"I played U1 for the first time a couple months ago (played the other 2 games a couple years ago, finally got around to playing U1 recently), when I got to the point with the monsters it was around 2 AM. Had to finish the dark sections of the game before I could go to bed or even think about sleeping."
uncharted,39fjhw,ThatGuy743,2,Fri Jun 12 00:54:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't like them, just because I felt they ruined the endings. I felt that the monsters were unnecessary."
uncharted,39fjhw,Phillyfishy1,11,Fri Jun 12 08:57:06 2015 UTC,That God Damn sound that plays every time you die in Uncharted 2.

uncharted,39fjhw,Zook024,9,Thu Jun 25 08:41:32 2015 UTC,"The enemies in cooperative multiplayer in Uncharted 2 I have ostensibly named snatchers. These are the sneaky shits that run around the map and aim to put you into an inescapable chokehold and if you are the last man standing, result in an insta kill."
uncharted,39fjhw,Anonymous94,6,Thu Jun 11 13:12:59 2015 UTC,But it's so satisfying to save other players from them with a headshot. Removing them would make co op much less challenging and not as fun IMO
uncharted,39fjhw,Zook024,6,Thu Jun 11 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"I agree the headshots are always satisfying however from playing with random players for most of my time with the co-op mode, it's just infuriating when they don't or can't save you and especially when you are last man standing, hunkered down and a random snatcher comes from behind and grabs you."
uncharted,39fjhw,mrjustice7,2,Thu Jun 11 16:12:37 2015 UTC,I called them breathers. Cuz the breathe.   I am not smart.

uncharted,39fjhw,paul521,7,Tue Jun 16 07:45:23 2015 UTC,"How many damn bullets it takes to kill enemies, even scrubs. I don't remember if U2 and 3 were as bad in this regard but in U1 it was ridiculous. You'd empty a clip and a half to take one guy out."
uncharted,39fjhw,hokagenaruto,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:39:54 2015 UTC,in u3 the enemies eat fucking bullets. they take so much gunfire. resulting to unloading on some of them
uncharted,39fjhw,someperson50502,6,Wed Jun 17 16:24:38 2015 UTC,The scene in the first game where you had to pilot the boat and shoot at the enemies was just brutal
uncharted,39fjhw,JKirbyy,5,Thu Jun 11 17:55:48 2015 UTC,"Just a pet peeve but having to press triangle to pick up ammo, kind of ruins the pace at time and leads to accidentally picking up a weapon on the ground you don't want."
uncharted,39fjhw,MagnanimousGenius,2,Thu Jun 11 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, ammo and grenades should be autopicked up. 100% agree."

uncharted,39fjhw,doug,12,Sat Jun 13 15:25:21 2015 UTC,The control mechanics of Uncharted: DF. Stoked for the remaster for this reason alone.
uncharted,39fjhw,GatorGalore,3,Thu Jun 11 11:50:57 2015 UTC,"Are they going to address that? I started with UC2, then went back to UC1 and my god were the controls just a little less responsive. For me the worst mechanic was tilting the controller to toss a grenade."
uncharted,39fjhw,doug,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, I hear the grenade thing a lot. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but can't you actually change the control settings in the options to not use the sixaxis?"
uncharted,39fjhw,GatorGalore,6,Fri Jun 12 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, you can change it to sixaxis in UC2 (it's off by default), but there never was an option to disable it in UC1. Some quick Googling yielded no results saying anything different."

uncharted,39fjhw,turdlop,2,Thu Jun 11 18:39:40 2015 UTC,Go from 2 or 3 to one. It controls so clunky. It's still a good game but that was hard to get used to.
uncharted,39fjhw,DoNotFeedAlligators,7,Thu Jun 11 18:42:34 2015 UTC,Does multiplayer stuff count? Cause I can't stand the hand-to-hand combat in multiplayer. I hope in Uncharted 4 it's at least similar to The Last of Us.
uncharted,39fjhw,DerekStu,6,Thu Jun 11 14:22:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't like that Nate touches everything he walks past in U3. I know he's not a real archeologist, but still why are you getting your only fingerprints all over everything? So weird that they added that."

uncharted,399ebo,repcorp,10,Wed Jun 10 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"I don't care that he's white or male any more than I would care if he was black or female.  He's a fun character, and political correctness & ethnicity quotas in entertainment media really piss me off, to be frank.  It's possible that Nate was designed around Nolan North.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a Tumblr blog somewhere accusing Naughty Dog of exacerbating all that 'patriarchy' and 'privilege' bollocks they go on about.  I'm glad these people don't have any real power.  When I sit down to play a game, I don't think 'oh no this character is white / black / male / female / straight / gay so I don't want to play this game'.  I just play the game and see if it's any good or not.  In L4D I always like playing as Louis because he's funny."
uncharted,399ebo,emperorpopeatine,4,Wed Jun 10 07:23:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think Nathan Drake is a generic white guy. He's awesome and has a fun and interesting personality. I really enjoy playing as him.  As someone who's not white, it's sad to have to come to terms with the fact that most people just don't give a shit about things like representation when their group is being represented. It's super easy to say, ""______ doesn't matter"" when a majority of TV shows and movies and games and other forms of entertainment pretty much portray your race/gender/etc as the norm, and overly so.   Do I think games need to have characters of a specific race or sex? No, but it would be nice if we did have more games with more diversity (and for those of you who may start to bring up the few minority or female characters that exist in video games, please don't act like this is the norm). People will feel however they feel, but I think it's messed up to discredit that others would want to be represented."

uncharted,399ebo,MagnanimousGenius,3,Sat Jun 13 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"Nate is the next generation Indiana Jones. He's fucking perfect the way he is. That being said, I'm a white dood, so it's hard to gauge how someone else would feel about it."
uncharted,399ebo,AlvisDBridges,3,Wed Jun 10 08:55:53 2015 UTC,"As a girl, I really like ND and their approach to characterizing Nate. He's by no means the stereotypical white male character because of how relatable he is, how human. He makes mistakes, he has faults. Nate is a good guy, but he's also clearly not a god or anything like that."
uncharted,399ebo,mrjustice7,2,Mon Jun 15 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"I cant reply to that question, i dont see him as generic at all."

It's not unusual, for a predominantly 'white' company, from a predominantly culturally/ethnically European nation to reflect their own background through a medium they express themselves through.  There's no ulterior motives here: I think you'll find most Asian films revolve around ethnically Asian peoples and themes relevant to their cultures, and likewise for every friggin' country across every continent where media is produced.   Just enjoy the game  P.S. And while I'm not calling Americans 'European' per say, I'm pointing out that the vast majority of Americans are white and are therefore of one ethnic European background or other, and do not discount any other ethnicity"

This time it was against Mitt Romney. Can you frickin believe it? What a joke!). Also, the PS4 and Xbox One are out, Apple released a watch, Google Glass was almost a complete failure. I think only one guy ultimately went to prison for the ""Great Recession"" (that's what we call it), not counting debtors.   Will you be returning to 2008 or are you stuck here? Because there are a lot of financial opportunities (as I'm sure anyone who can build a time machine is well aware of by the time they finish it and get a successful run) to consider if indeed you can go back."

I'm going to keep going forward enough to where I can play some great games so far this decade suck ass in terms of video games. No Sonic No Mega Man no Uncharted No F-zero No Jet Set Radio No Conker I mean wtf?

uncharted,38iqb7,DerekStu,26,Thu Jun 4 14:10:09 2015 UTC,Kinda weird that Naughty Dog is the sole reason I went with Playstation. I can't think of a comparable developer for other platforms that warrants purchasing a console/PC for.
uncharted,38iqb7,doug,5,Thu Jun 4 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"Nintendo... Unless you meant solely developers, not manufacturers"
uncharted,38iqb7,GoldBananas,7,Thu Jun 4 22:16:27 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to say it, I feel like I've outgrown Nintendo games. I'd owned both a Nintendo DS & Wii, they wound up collecting dust over time. If I had more disposable income, I may eventually get a Wii-U, but it's always felt like more of a 'party' console, in that I'd have more fun with it if I had friends for local gaming (...that said one of my friends has one, and we use his a lot)."
uncharted,38iqb7,doug,2,Thu Jun 4 22:19:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I opted for a Wii U instead of a PS4, and right now I'm looking in to getting one, Uncharted is something I don't want to miss. The local gaming is probably where it shines, however most of my playtime is from smash bros online, Mario Kart 8, and some of the great single player games like The Wonderful 101."

uncharted,38iqb7,crossbreed55,26,Thu Jun 4 18:23:39 2015 UTC,I think you can trust ND with a preorder - they have delivered consistent products both last and this generation
uncharted,38iqb7,Salute_The_Bud,-11,Thu Jun 4 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"Of course I have faith in Naughty Dog, but this is about sending a message to publishers.  No matter who is behind the game: No preorders, no exceptions."
uncharted,38iqb7,crossbreed55,14,Thu Jun 4 18:53:40 2015 UTC,I only hold that resentment to studios that do not deliver. ND does
uncharted,38iqb7,Salute_The_Bud,5,Thu Jun 4 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"No matter who is behind the game: No preorders, no exceptions.   throwing the baby out with the bathwater is popular in your part of the world?"
uncharted,38iqb7,knockoutking,-3,Thu Jun 4 19:48:25 2015 UTC,"How would me being against preorders make you think that?  You can still buy the game at launch. Paying for a game you have never played and seen nothing of except for carefully crafted marketing material tells publishers that it's okay to deliver a unfinished, inferior product because they will get your money anyway.  Again I am also very optimistic that ND will deliver, but this is about the entire industry, not just the studios that usually make good, finished products."
uncharted,38iqb7,crossbreed55,3,Thu Jun 4 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm pre-ordering this for the bonuses. Not even the U4 beta, but the new costumes and weapons. To get new content for my favourite games I've played countless times is far too good to pass up.  I understand that this is the exact sort of practice we want to stop, but Naughty Dog are the hugest exception."
uncharted,38iqb7,BlueBlur8,4,Fri Jun 5 03:41:58 2015 UTC,Naughty Dog is literally the only dev I will a pre-order a game from because I literally haven't been disappointed by a single of their games (Jak X gets a mulligan).

uncharted,38iqb7,92Jas,17,Thu Jun 4 14:35:01 2015 UTC,"The completionist in me is a little frustrated that Golden Abyss isn't in here. I don't think it's a particularly thrilling entry, but if we're calling this the ""Nathan Drake Collection,"" then it's not complete without G.A.  Beyond that, does anyone else think this sounds like they're possibly hinting that the future of Uncharted is long, but Nathan Drake's is short? If this is the Nathan Drake Collection, maybe he won't be the star of future entries."
uncharted,38iqb7,WillRogers9000,3,Thu Jun 4 14:34:18 2015 UTC,Really sad that there won't be multiplayer or coop also :(
uncharted,38iqb7,HowieGaming,9,Thu Jun 4 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking I'm fine with that. I've always felt that multiplayer is dated. When a new entry in a series comes out, most people just hop into that game's multi.  I just hope they remove the option for multi from all the menus. Some re-released games use the exact same menu and end up feeling unfinished or poorly designed because they offer something that doesn't exist.  Mostly this pack of games is for the single player, so that makes sense. What doesn't make sense is calling it ""The Nathan Drake Collection,"" since it's not complete"

uncharted,38hkzl,beefstewie,2,Thu Jun 4 09:47:29 2015 UTC,Official now. Can't wait.
uncharted,38hkzl,nicktheman2,2,Thu Jun 4 14:41:57 2015 UTC,October 9th
uncharted,38hkzl,A1var3z7,2,Thu Jun 4 17:28:20 2015 UTC,75$ cdn feels a bit ridiculous.
uncharted,38hkzl,crossbreed55,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:59:44 2015 UTC,Any predictions on when this could be released?
uncharted,38hkzl,A1var3z7,3,Thu Jun 4 10:03:14 2015 UTC,I'd say before the holidays. Doesn't really make sense to wait any longer with A Thief's End Coming out spring next year.
uncharted,38hkzl,morphinapg,4,Thu Jun 4 11:18:05 2015 UTC,That's what I figured. I could see it possibly being a bit earlier (August or September) if they've had this in the works for a while (obviously).
uncharted,38hkzl,A1var3z7,2,Thu Jun 4 11:20:52 2015 UTC,"TLOU Remastered was announced early April and came out late July.   If they follow the same schedule, I'd expect late September, which corresponds to an earlier rumor that stated September 30 (likely placeholder for ""September 2015"" or ""Q3 2015"")"

uncharted,38kte8,Studovich,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"That's too bad. No need to buy it, then! Would be nice for them to upgrade U2's multiplayer, like changing it so you don't get booted from the co-op if one player leaves. I'm sure there will be other ways to get into the beta for U4."
uncharted,38isiq,NintendoNerd16,3,Thu Jun 4 14:24:48 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for a special PS4 bundle with the remastered Uncharted collection and/or Uncharted 4 :D
uncharted,38isiq,AimT_oMisbehave,2,Thu Jun 4 15:48:10 2015 UTC,"I'm undecided. I'm either gonna get a PS4 to play the collection along with Battlefront to hold me over for 4 - or - I'm gonna buy the limited edition PS4 bundle (this is total speculation, I have no idea if there will be a limited edition PS4 model - but I'm definitely getting the collectors edition of 4)"
uncharted,38in7c,crossbreed55,3,Thu Jun 4 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"They were working on A Thief's End, there was probably a lot of time just preparing art assets and writing the story and probably by a year or so before PS4 came out they had a dev kit for it and were able to start work in full.    There was some drama as Amy Hennig and others left Naughty Dog in the middle of A Thief's End's development after The Last of US came out.  After that there had to have been a period of redesign and rewrites as Neil and Bruce took over.    Naughty Dog has stated they have at least 4 projects going on, U4 and 3 other projects including 1 which was supposed to be something completely new, but they were dodgy about it so I suspect there is a good chance those other projects never come to light.  One of those projects turned out to be TLOU remastered and it looks like another is the Nathan Drake collection.  But that leaves at least 1 other thing that company is working on.    As far as the two teams, the team that made U3 went on to U4 and maybe spent a little time helping the TLOU team on DLC and remastered.  The TLOU team probably went on to do the DLC and TLOU remastered, then some of them may have joined U4, some of them may be doing the uncharted collection, and some of them may be working on another project that we don't know about.  They say they split into two teams but I have a feeling since they have such a flat open structure that people move around and work on different things all the time."

uncharted,38in7c,RedDevil_BAMF,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:37:12 2015 UTC,It looks like the Nathan Drake Collection was done by another studio completely.  Bluepoint Games.

uncharted,38in7c,LoyolaProp1,3,Thu Jun 4 15:03:12 2015 UTC,"yes, its in the official announcement on Playstation Blog  Specifically, this snippet:   Early last month, Eric and I took a trip to Austin on the down low to visit the incredible team at Bluepoint Games to check out Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection in person and get ready for this announcement. What weâve seen of the game so far looks fantastic!"
uncharted,38in7c,RedDevil_BAMF,2,Thu Jun 4 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks, well I hope they know what they're doing."
uncharted,38in7c,kacboy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"Typically with remasters the parent studio (ND) has final approval on the remasters. ND wouldn't let their masterpieces be brought down by another studio. I have no doubt it will be a great experience. ND wons all of the IP involved with Uncharted, so for example Golden Abyss was developed by Sony Bend, but ND had final say on all elements. It turned out great. As for ND, I imagine THOU 2 is already in development to come out in 2017 or 2018."
uncharted,38exvo,crossbreed55,6,Wed Jun 3 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"definitely with you on your idea for U4 having a consistent environment.   I've seen it somewhere on this sub, but being stuck on that island made the first one magical in a way. you felt yourself getting lost in it.   while the other two had amazing set pieces and awesome globe trotting - just something about UK2642 that stands out"
uncharted,38exvo,Salute_The_Bud,4,Thu Jun 4 03:52:47 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with U3 was globe trotting. I really hope U4 stays at the island for most of it.
uncharted,38exvo,TheFourGuy,3,Thu Jun 4 04:38:00 2015 UTC,Apparently U4 will be globe trotting as well
uncharted,38dx95,nicktheman2,5,Wed Jun 3 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me. It follows the trend of the first three games, that is, having the cover based on the initial teaser trailer. No surprises here."
uncharted,38dx95,tinfoil21,10,Wed Jun 3 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"Would've hoped for something else tbh, maybe just a shot of the lush jungle scenery or something.   The heroic single protagonist standing in the center is overdone (see battlefield, cod, halo, etc)"

uncharted,38dx95,Zook024,2,Wed Jun 3 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, had that one in mind.  Here's some more  Modern Warfare 2  Modern Warfare 3  Assassin's Creed II  Halo 3 (a little different, but same premise)"

uncharted,38dx95,comiclover1377,3,Wed Jun 3 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"There's a lot on the line for Drake, and although it's been promised to be the same campy over-the-top action-adventure game, the plot takes centre stage over the gameplay for A Thief's End. At least, that's what I'm assuming since it's the last game (and from what we've seen so far). The cover portrays that. I like it."
uncharted,38dx95,BlueBlur8,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:59:27 2015 UTC,Has it been confirmed that it's the last game in the series??
uncharted,38dx95,LFCMick,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's been heavily hinted at. Nolan North made a statement last year that he thinks Naughty Dog want to wrap it up here. Plot-wise, Drake's been forced into this adventure by his brother, so it's likely he'll go back into retirement if he survives this one."
uncharted,38dx95,BlueBlur8,3,Thu Jun 4 13:48:19 2015 UTC,"Looks grim, I'm afraid that Neil Drukmann might make the game more serious and not as light hearted/fun as the previous games.  The last of us is my favorite game of all time but I didn't want to play the campaign more than once simply because of how sad it made me feel. Uncharted on the other hand I can't even count how many time I've replayed each game's campaign, so I would be really disappointed if that's where the series is headed."
uncharted,38dx95,Anonymous94,5,Wed Jun 3 22:16:32 2015 UTC,He's repeatedly said he knows the difference between the series. Do not worry.

uncharted,388iu5,Askiles,12,Tue Jun 2 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"I think we will see the remastered collection and I think we will see another gameplay demo, this time in a completely different environment, maybe with some more story information.  I doubt they would show multiplayer unless they are planning on doing something drastically new with it, and I expect multiplayer to be basically the same as U3, maybe with some slight tweaks.  In a dream world I would love to see Sony announce another Vita game.  Also, when they do the remastered collection I'd like to see Golden Abyss included in that, with the necessary control modifications to make the game work on a PS4."
uncharted,388iu5,elpedro84,3,Tue Jun 2 18:44:59 2015 UTC,This is my favorite idea I want to see like some completely new environment we wouldn't expect and have a little demo of that. That'd be cool.
uncharted,388iu5,GatorGalore,2,Tue Jun 2 20:45:18 2015 UTC,My guess is we will see the snowy enviornment they mentioned a while ago.
uncharted,388iu5,odj310388,4,Wed Jun 3 16:02:30 2015 UTC,Story trailer and if we are lucky gameplay demo.
uncharted,388iu5,morphinapg,3,Tue Jun 2 20:06:58 2015 UTC,"We'll see a new gameplay demo of Uncharted 4, plus a story trailer. After that they will announce the Uncharted Remastered collection, which will include Golden Abyss, out for PS4 this holiday.   I think there's a chance they will announce an Uncharted 4 multiplayer beta as well, just like with Uncharted 3. I don't know if this is very likely though, because Uncharted 3 wasn't too different from Uncharted 2, but Uncharted 4 is likely to be quite a lot different."
uncharted,388iu5,Boogachoog,4,Tue Jun 2 20:25:58 2015 UTC,"This will be their last E3 with Uncharted 4 so this is where they'll show what the game of capable of. So get ready for some large set piece. Not their most grand, but something that wows."

uncharted,376mfw,stevyjohny,3,Mon May 25 08:45:25 2015 UTC,I too liked the combat system in U3 but it sure was twitchy. I liked that U1 tried to be a little mysterious and made you wonder and I hope U4 will expand on that.
uncharted,376mfw,A_Highwayman,2,Mon May 25 11:33:58 2015 UTC,"Uncharted is adventure, wit, exotic locals and evolving friendships. Naughty Dog has a superb storytelling pedigree. Gameplay appears to bring nuance into play while the superb graphics always amaze.   You are absolutely right about those generic villains. Way too much sometimes.  The delay has been hard to take. How are they going to forgo Christmas sales? That said, I'll the the better game over it releasing on time.   Is this the last game? I'd be heartbroken but understanding."
uncharted,376mfw,fxrx,1 point,Mon May 25 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"I was also disappointed with the delay, although I accept that if it really isn't ready then they should not release it this year. But they definitely handled it poorly. The whole Game Informer coverage in February seemed to suggest a 2015 release. They never said that of course. But Uncharted has always had a certain schedule: show gameplay video at E3 then release it six months later. In this case, they gave us gameplay video in December. Then they allowed Game Informer to do an exclusive magazine update. All of it just felt like it should have been released soon.   I didn't think about Christmas sales but they definitely miss out on that. They built up a bunch of anticipation that has gone to waste now because of the delay."

uncharted,376mfw,kacboy,0,Mon May 25 14:42:50 2015 UTC,Uncharted isn't supposed to be ruthless and trying to backstab you.
uncharted,376mfw,the_Ex_Lurker,2,Tue May 26 01:11:31 2015 UTC,I don't mean in terms of being intelligently ruthless. I mean having some basic self-preservation and communication.
uncharted,376mfw,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Tue May 26 02:28:21 2015 UTC,"I mentioned it before that it seems to be a problem in most games, but it still is kind of odd how the AI behaves. And just looking at the video, it doesn't look like anything special was done with the AI. It's true. They have little to no self preservation. For example, it would be nice if enemies actually tried retreating or running to cover when you're shooting at them."
uncharted,374zc9,crossbreed55,10,Sun May 24 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. I feel like the island had an air of mystery to it, and was almost a character itself. It was almost like I was playing a season of LOST. It was the first game I played on PS3."
uncharted,374zc9,penciledindotcom,4,Sun May 24 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"This is why I hope that ND can go back to its roots somewhat in the next game. Uncharted just got way too big. They focused too much on set pieces. U1 definitely had them but they were much more natural and ""environmental"".  Even ND admitted that they chose - before they even made the game - what set pieces they wanted and then built the story around that. I'm sure that's what I remember. If someone could correct me on that, it would be appreciated. But even if the opposite path is chosen, writing a story and then jamming set pieces into it, it can result in a clunky experience.  I think U3 proves this to be true. It technically had amazing set pieces, but the overall game felt a little clunky as well as everything in between the set pieces.  I just want some solid gameplay and a story. I care more about that than set pieces."
uncharted,374zc9,stevyjohny,5,Mon May 25 09:28:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah the air of mystery was something they really did well in U1 even though I thought the combat got so repetive because there were enemies everywhere, every time. Walk three steps - ""I see him!!"" - kill them and walk around the corner - ""Phew, I finally lost them, this place is safe."" - Walk ten meters and get shot at."
uncharted,374zc9,A_Highwayman,2,Mon May 25 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"Very well put my friend, I'm glad I'm not alone."
uncharted,374zc9,arcalumis,7,Sun May 24 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, the first game felt like an adventure. Not multiple adventures with travel inbetween. You go from one sticky situation into another, your plane crashes, you go search for it, Elena is gone, you go and rescue her. And in the end you come to the thrilling conclusion, beat the bad guy and get the girl.  It was everything an adventure game should be. The following Uncharteds were great but they felt a bit disjointed."
uncharted,374zc9,mgshowtime22,5,Sun May 24 23:24:55 2015 UTC,"The Uncharted: DF storyline and feel was my favorite, but I hated the controls, or at least the feel of the contrs. Still, it's the one I have the fondest memories of playing."
uncharted,374zc9,stevyjohny,2,Sun May 24 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's the most out dated in terms of controls. That's the only thing it has going against it compared to the others which is no fault of its own. Video game series get better as they progress. ND tweaked the melee and shooting over the next two games. If they could implement an updated combat system in a potential remake, I think it would likely be the best Uncharted game."
uncharted,374zc9,BlackNyellow,5,Mon May 25 09:20:44 2015 UTC,I like everything about it except for some of the ridiculous  shoot outs where the game sends like 25 guys at you in one little section.
uncharted,374zc9,A_Highwayman,4,Mon May 25 00:16:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I hated that the enemies attacked in stupid waves and were everywhere. Nate solved a puzzle and open up a room that has been closed for some centuries? Luckily the stupid villains just got there too moments before
uncharted,374zc9,stevyjohny,4,Mon May 25 19:38:34 2015 UTC,"I agree as well. The location does not take anything away from the game, but I think enhances it. The isolation of the island adds a certain sense of adventure. You can never go wrong with mysterious islands! Always a classic. There are some advantages to the setting as well. Everything is happening continually because of the lone setting. There are no breaks in the story. No movement from country to country. That isn't to say that globe trotting adventures are bad. It's just that each has their own set of pros and cons as well as affecting the overall mood. I think the lone island setting is more akin to a true ""roller coaster"" type atmosphere.  It makes sense that they went global in 2. ND had to shake it up.   I don't really know what my favorite one is. I do think 3 felt stale as it seemed to repeat too many elements of 2. They made it global again which we had just done in 2.  I don't know what the perfect formula is. But shaking things up as much as possible is essential.   Uncharted 4 looks like it could be another island game which I have no complaints about."
uncharted,374zc9,GatorGalore,3,Mon May 25 09:15:52 2015 UTC,"If UC1 got remastered with updated gameplay mechanics it would probably be my favorite. Right now though, the clunky, frustrating mechanics hold it back too much for me to want to replay frequently. I think the story is the very best of the trilogy though."
uncharted,3743vy,Boogachoog,2,Sun May 24 18:20:01 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing on my channel and mine turned out to be 3 hours, and I feel like I did quite a lot of editing as well. I'll check it out, should be interesting to see what you did."

uncharted,36gs76,oldenvye6432,3,Tue May 19 07:22:38 2015 UTC,"While Uncharted 3 lags behind U2 as my favourite game in the series, what it does have going for it is great action set pieces that are probably as close to an actual adventure film as were going to get.  I'm a big fan of action music cues and David Arnold's Casino Royale in my opinion has composed some of the finest. When playing this part of the game it reminded me of the parkour chase from Daniel Craig's first Bond film so I've taken the track from those scenes and slightly edited it to fit the gameplay - The results I think work very well and particular time and attention was given to balancing the sound effects with the music. If you like this I have a couple of other videos of Uncharted that I've also rescored and would love to share them.    Hope you enjoy."
uncharted,36gs76,WillRogers9000,3,Tue May 19 07:32:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, I was very confused watching this. I thought you meant Re-Scored, as in ""Lets take a look at highly-rated games and reevaluate their score.""   Cool video, but I kind of didn't even realize the music was different for a while, and I was waiting for the narrator to come in and talk about the strengths and weaknesses of the game.  Not a knock against what the video is, but you could perhaps make the focus of the video clearer.  Anyway, solid job.  The fact that I didn't even think the music was different is a testament to how well you did!  Got to go: starting a show called ReScored where I re-review beloved games."

uncharted,36gv5s,DeadlyGreenGecko,6,Tue May 19 08:04:03 2015 UTC,"We just don't know; rumours did circulate about it earlier this year but nothing was confirmed and Naughty Dog eventually refuted the claims.  They may be hesitant to make it happen because of their recent comments about Uncharted 4 possibly not reaching 60 fps.  Everybody would be expecting a remaster of the original trilogy to run at 60 fps, and if this were to be followed by a 30 fps Uncharted 4 then Naughty Dog would be opening themselves to much criticism."
uncharted,36gv5s,emperorpopeatine,3,Tue May 19 11:29:04 2015 UTC,"Naughty Dog isn't making the remaster, almost guaranteed. Strong evidence suggests Bluepoint Games is making the Remasters and that it will even include Golden Abyss."
uncharted,36gv5s,morphinapg,1 point,Wed May 20 00:56:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I also heard those rumours and when they completed the Sly Cooper remake they said they don't want to ever do a thing like that again because it was really annoying to do or something... :-/ But I have never played the first two UC's so I am really curious about it!

uncharted,367bi5,evilclownmonkey,2,Sun May 17 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"ND won't make another, but it would be too profitable for PS to just abandon the IP forever. Maybe another studio will do something with it. I doubt it would be a full fledged Uncharted game, so I don't think there will be an Uncharted 5. Maybe they'll tell more about Drake or Sully's earlier lives or something like that."

uncharted,35bnxt,Salute_The_Bud,21,Fri May 8 19:39:45 2015 UTC,"Here's what I like to think:  There's a quaint, rustic little hideaway on the beach somewhere, off the beaten... not too expensive or flashy, maybe it even has a roof made of palm fronds. On one of those Caribbean islands that doesn't get too much press and is therefore super-chill and filled with interesting folk who mind their own business. You got Sully's place a couple hundred yards down the beach on one side, and a little hole-in-the-wall tiki bar a couple hundred yards in the other direction. It gets crazy down there some nights; bottomless rum drinks that lead to barefoot dancing in the sand to the sound of steel drums. Sully usually gets hammered and takes his clothes off, brazenly leading the skinny-dipping brigade...  It's a quite life (when not treasure-hunting), and He and Elena can totally have sex on the beach without worrying about someone walking up on themâ under a full moon, even. Elena does freelance work for the New Yorker and CondÃ© Nast once or twice a year. Drake runs, swims, tries to keep in shape. Under the sun, the sea is pale blue and the sand is white. Fishing every now and then with Sully on a little boat they share, which is moored on the dock between them.   It takes less money than you would think to live like this; the economy here is favorable to those who have dollars and euros. Sully started an investment account for Drake decades ago, and the compounding has worked out well. The Swiss accounts already have more than enough to retire on; not millions, but enough profit from all the adventures to live rather comfortably on this little island they call home."

uncharted,33z2h6,Svstem,3,Mon Apr 27 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"I think the snipers in Uncharted 3 are incredibly well-balanced compared to most games. The Dragon is hard-ish to get good at but once you practice, it's competitive with the full-auto weapons without feeling cheap to the people you kill. And the T-Bolt's incredibly long reload time makes it fair. Plus, jumpsnipes are too much fun."

uncharted,33z2h6,AntiForm30,2,Mon Apr 27 17:09:08 2015 UTC,I really enjoy both t-bolt and dragon in the uc3 mp. I'm a legacy master [if that's what it's called] and I run a class with the tbolt and dragon all the time when. I play. The dragon is fairly easy to get kills with as is the tbolt and I feel like in uc4 it would be nice to have a bolt action sniper something like the dsr50 from black ops2. The pullback rate on the bolt could offset the obvious damage advantage that you have over the dragon sniper. But just an idea

I don't remember exactly but I think my disc was either scratched or dirty.  Try cleaning your PS3's disc drive with an air can too.  And make sure your PS3 isn't overheating and has breathing room.  Of course, disc tips are useless if you're playing the digital version."

uncharted,334t9s,PacifistHeavy,0,Sun Apr 19 22:29:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say that ""The End"" itself could actually be a spoiler, that the series is actually ending. Obviously the title seems to imply this, but this may be more specific confirmation."
uncharted,334t9s,morphinapg,4,Sun Apr 19 23:41:15 2015 UTC,Seriously! I was expecting a fade to black.
uncharted,334t9s,that_guy_next_to_you,3,Mon Apr 20 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"I know it's a stupid little thing, but I would really rather have a fade to black. One thing I thought about today though is that since the previous three games have all had fade to blacks, you could say having it being a straight cut in UC4 would mean it's the definitive end.  I know I sound ridiculous."
uncharted,334t9s,that_guy_next_to_you,2,Mon Apr 20 03:13:05 2015 UTC,"You know, I was joking, but now that you bring it up, a cut to black when the other games have a fade is interesting and could mean a definite end. Or a cliffhanger ending :)  Did The Last of Us have a cut to black (since Neil worked on it)? I think it did."
uncharted,334t9s,theweepingwarrior,2,Mon Apr 20 03:30:23 2015 UTC,Yes it did.
uncharted,334t9s,morphinapg,6,Mon Apr 20 08:42:05 2015 UTC,"Note that they film things out of order, so they're not done shooting the story."

uncharted,334t9s,morphinapg,3,Mon Apr 20 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"No no, the tweet was saying that they had filmed the performance capture for the end scene. The script has likely been finished for a while now. These games are animated primarily via performance capture, actors acting on a stage that gets translated into the CG characters, then the animators manually work on the facial animation since Naughty Dog doesn't do face motion capture."

uncharted,335nzw,kennycharter,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:41:06 2015 UTC,"I think for sure they'll have different skins for at least Drake and maybe his buddies in the same way TLOU had them. It would be cool if they implemented Drake's outfits from each of the previous games. But I don't at all expect to see swappable characters. If we do play as Sully or Sam it will be within the story.  And another thing to remember is that all the cutscenes are now in-game, so the bonus costumes would be visible in them."

I especially love TR's use of exploring the environment with the weapons you collect and the survival aspect of it.  But yeah The Last of Us is pretty great too.

uncharted,32y3oc,PhoenixJaeger,9,Fri Apr 17 17:51:31 2015 UTC,"I don't like the ""more like bourne than indy"" comment. I do like that they want to focus more on Drake's story and his relationship with Elena though. I don't like that they still seemed to be looking at Wahlberg as soon as last summer. You need someone with charisma to play Drake, not just someone who can do action. Bradley Cooper, Chris Evans, James Roday, or even Nathan Fillion if they want to go more for a tie in with Uncharted 4's older Drake. (Chris Pratt already said no but he'd be great too)   Although I'd personally love to see Nolan North do it, but I think the studio wants a big name (unfortunately). Let's hope that even if they can't get Nolan, that they still get Emily Rose for Elena."
uncharted,32y3oc,morphinapg,7,Fri Apr 17 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"If James Roday was in the shape he was in season 1 of Psych, he'd make a perfect Drake."
uncharted,32y3oc,-OrangeLightning4,2,Fri Apr 17 20:46:57 2015 UTC,Pedro Pascal is my choice
uncharted,32y3oc,JadedDarkness,6,Sun Apr 19 01:30:24 2015 UTC,"I said this before, and I'll say it again. I really think Bradley Cooper would be great for the role. He has the looks, is well known enough for producers, and truly has Nate's charisma and humor. As an added benefit, he sounds extremely similar to Drake. I was taken aback when I saw American Hustle and the Serena trailer."
uncharted,32y3oc,justintime57,3,Sat Apr 18 03:50:38 2015 UTC,"None of the actors mentioned appeal to me as Drake. Marky Mark seems too old to me and I don't know I am just sick of him. Nathan Fillon while awesome also seems too old, considering the are more likely going for the drake from the earlier games not the unreleased one. Who's the guy from Guardians of the Galaxy, maybe him."
uncharted,32y3oc,fifty8th,2,Fri Apr 17 21:36:00 2015 UTC,Chris Pratt would be awesome. I think if Andrew Garfield bulked up a little he would be a good Drake. But maybe they should get a no name and mold him into Nathan Drake
uncharted,32y3oc,morphinapg,3,Fri Apr 17 22:55:08 2015 UTC,Chris Pratt already turned the role down
uncharted,32y3oc,fifty8th,2,Sat Apr 18 09:43:11 2015 UTC,I don't know why but I've never warmed up to Garfield I just dislike him for no reason. But I do agree about a no name.
uncharted,32y3oc,arcalumis,3,Sat Apr 18 04:14:06 2015 UTC,So they left the Uncharted canon by introducing Nates father? According to the games his father left him in a state orphanage which he ditched at 14 and met Sully when he was 15.

But Uncharted will, Kadin said.   uggghhhh   ""It should be intense and more engaging for adults, and of course young teens as well.""   shiiiit  edit: so I read the script. It's not bad actually. I have faith in this movie."

uncharted,32nhog,MasterKingdomKey,9,Wed Apr 15 04:58:57 2015 UTC,"This is purely the differences in lighting. I watched this technical talk in which these images were shown. The top is the type of natural lighting that we see in every-day life or movies or games. The bottom is ""render lighting"" made to show off 3D models. It's a lot flatter, more unrealistic and exaggerates facial features.  And if ND was going to spring a surprise like that, they wouldn't just casually leak it in a technical talk.  Check out this video to see how much lighting can change how a person can look: https://vimeo.com/63602119"
uncharted,32nhog,will-dearborn,4,Wed Apr 15 15:36:16 2015 UTC,The more natural colors on the top are hiding all of the marks on his cheek and wrinkles. They seem to be just as old as each other
uncharted,32nhog,MajestyMosquito,2,Wed Apr 15 05:01:25 2015 UTC,"Look past the colors and lighting. IRL, even if you're in different lighting doesn't mean your age should look different. Drake obviously looks older on the bottom."
uncharted,32nhog,A_Highwayman,7,Wed Apr 15 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's because the lightning is less flattering. I think he just looks better at the top, not younger."
uncharted,32nhog,stormcrow2112,2,Wed Apr 15 08:19:49 2015 UTC,"The images I posted are of Drake in UC4. However, why does he look so different between the two images? Sure, they're in different lighting and Drake's eyes are closed in one and open in another; but that doesn't explain why all of Drake's features are just nonexistent on the top. Drake in the bottom image looks noticeably older (grayer hair, more wrinkles, and old skin marks on his cheek). Drake on the top; however, looks cleaner and younger. Maybe it's just a problem with the lighting that's masking his features but I believe that UC4 will flashback from the past and the present. What do you guys think?"

uncharted,32g970,A_Highwayman,2,Tue Apr 14 06:27:12 2015 UTC,"Hey Freddy! I Really like the factions subreddit and your loadout calculator! I like this idea a lot. It's hard to say what UC4 is multiplayer is gonna look like. The differences between UC2 and UC3 multiplayer show that naughty dog is definitely a fan of changing the formula.     It seems likely that there will be customizable loadouts like UC3, but currently there is no need for the calculator part of it because boosters don't have cost. (This might change in UC4)    I think most youtubers have moved on, but I know lebandit was a big one for a while.    Uncharted 3 had a treasure hunting system so there might be something cool that you could do with that if they include it in uc4.    As for the laughably naive part, I would really encourage you to play some UC3 multiplayer to see if you like it. I'm assuming a lot of elements will be the same in UC4. I play most days and it's pretty easy to get a match still.    Looking forward to seeing what happens with the multiplayer sub. Keep us posted!"
uncharted,32g970,Chronospherics,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:06:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome, great response, thanks!  For UC4, the calculator idea isn't essential per se, but quite a few of the idea's have are centred around it at the moment. We will just have to wait and see what they come up with this time! Like I said, its mostly the same MP team from Factions so hopefully we will see a bit of the cool stuff from that brought over - obviously gotta keep that Uncharted feel though!  Unfortunately my PS3 is out of action and I have moved over to the PS4 now, I'll definitely check out lebandit - the content doesn't have to be recent at all - in fact its probably better if its from back in the good old days of UC multiplayer :)"

I also expect a lot of the same people who got into Factions - even if they have never played Uncharted - to pick up UC4 purely because of that :)"

uncharted,31ddvf,EdgeEdgeBatistaBomb,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd fully agree. I think that Uncharted 3's campaign does some really interesting thing from a narrative perspective and is a lot more daring than the relatively safe campaign of it's predecessor. If there's anything Uncharted 2 had going for it, it was the element of surprise in terms of its spectacle. I had seen almost everything Uncharted 3 had to offer in that department in pre-release, and not from rumors, from straight marketing! But Uncharted 2, I was blind as a bat playing through it initally. The multiplayer offerings were more intuitive in U3 as well, in my opinion. (Split screen is always a major plus in my book.) I will say that U2 was an important game for me at the time I got it due to some things happening in my life at the time I played it, but when 3 launched, it just blew me out of the water. Despite this, I find it easier to go back to 3 than 2 almost any day of the week."
uncharted,31b1wy,kalrith,9,Fri Apr 3 13:24:14 2015 UTC,"Golden Abyss is a lot more standalone, compared to 1 through 3 which have a bit more continiuity (but are still mostly standalone actually).  I believe GA takes place before the main trilogy as well. The only thing that you'll miss out on is knowing who a certain character from the main trilogy is, as GA kind of assumes you know him. But overall, you'll be fine."

uncharted,30da34,JohnQuigley,4,Thu Mar 26 13:51:27 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the graphics, but the fact that it's only 720p. Multiplayer Drake has a really fat head though for some reason."

Thing is, the screen is large, and I took the picture really close to it - you can see the pixels, and it's a 4K screen.  Wow. -6 comment score, really? Are people jealous of a 4K TV? Fucking pathetic. Can't even share thoughts on Reddit anymore or what? Or maybe I didn't make sense in my comment? An explanation would be nice, instead of dumb downvoting."
uncharted,30da34,AceninjaNZ,3,Thu Mar 26 23:03:00 2015 UTC,"4K eh? Ah that sucks. Most 1080p games probably won't even look great to you because of that. The problem is, 4K means everything is going to be upscaled from 1080p to 4K, and unless the game has really good anti-aliasing (hint: most console games don't) the jagged edges will be exaggerated after the upscale. Although, obviously 1080p will look a bit better than 720p. A native 1080p TV would look better for most 1080p games, since current consoles won't support 4K for games."
uncharted,30da34,clonefreak2,2,Fri Mar 27 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that in theory, but all of PS4 stuff actually looks really, really good at 1080p (or sometimes slightly less than that), even if I get very close to the screen. If you try PS3 games though, the difference is huge thanks to 720p and less resolutions."

uncharted,30da34,drunkadvice,-3,Thu Mar 26 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"Well that was the point - on a screenshot, it wouldn't look as bad. The screenshot would be in 720p (resolution of the game), so it'd look just fine, while it looks like this on the actual screen :("

uncharted,30da34,morphinapg,3,Thu Mar 26 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"20, in fact. I don't complain about the graphics, but rather about the resolution. I got a PS1 and 2 connected to this TV so I'm not the type to complain, but if there is a choice between 720p and 1080p, there is absolutely no reason to go with the lower."
uncharted,30da34,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"I understand. And I meant no offense by that.  Honestly, I can't play final fantasy 7 because the graphics are in that awkward 3d but not all there stage (basically anything from the N64, PS1 generation).  I personally think that generation was trying to hard and can't hold up.    As someone who grew up with NES and SNES , I'm impressed at anything after PS2."

uncharted,30da34,morphinapg,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"Huh. No surprise, really...so many games do that these days. At least Uncharted manages to actually look good visually!"
uncharted,30da34,kacboy,1 point,Fri Mar 27 10:12:33 2015 UTC,"Well it has to do that for 3D simply because it needs to render two images, so in the end you're getting the same number of pixels as 720p, but it's just split between your two eyes. 2D mode is still native 720p"
uncharted,30da34,morphinapg,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:34:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that. Probably the reason Sony pretty much ditched 3D on PS4, the graphical fidelity drop is just not worth it for most people."
uncharted,30da34,kacboy,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:07:17 2015 UTC,"Except for the fact that the ps4 can run any game at full 720p in 3D. 720p is the only resolution supported for 3D for gaming on TVs anyway. Unless of course you allow for the side-by-side mode (which was used before the frame packed standard), in which case every ps4 game could easily do 1080p 3D.  It really makes no sense why Sony would abandon it considering they'd be able to run every game just fine in 3D on ps4. And now with Morpheus, any game supporting Morpheus should also be able to easily support 3DTV, and at 60fps with that. If they don't I'll be incredibly annoyed."
uncharted,30da34,ginsunuva,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed on 720p, but I don't see how they can easily do 1080p 3D. Even on PC you need very beefy hardware to do 3D, as I owned a 3D vision-compatible monitor myself until fairly recently."
uncharted,30da34,ginsunuva,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"Well here's the thing. There are two ways to do 1080p 3D on 3DTVs.   The first is the way movies do it. The problem is, it's at a refresh rate of 24hz, so a maximum of 24fps. Very few games would be okay with this. Maybe Beyond Two Souls or something lol. The only other way to do 1080p 3D on a TV is to use a side-by-side pattern of two 960x1080 images next to each other (TVs will detect this pattern and automatically display in 3D). The thing is: 960x1080 + 960x1080 = 1920x1080. That means, any game that can run at 1080p now can easily do side-by-side 3D. It's actually very close to the same number of total pixels you'd need to render for full 720p 3D, but tends to look a bit better because we're more sensitive to vertical resolution than horizontal. I would suggest 1080p 3D if the game had good AA, otherwise 720p, simply because there would be less stretched pixels, and stretched pixels look worse with bad AA."
uncharted,30da34,Boldizzle,2,Fri Mar 27 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"Huh. That actually makes perfect sense!  I was simply under the impression that any 3D image in games works by presenting 2 full-resolution frames instead of 1 at any given time, thus doubling the needed performance. At least it seems like PC games worked that way, seeing as how the performance drop in 3D was pretty huge.  Another idea I was very excited about when upgrading to this TV was to try split screen in 3D which allows for each player to see his own image, but boy was the implementation shitty. Just a couple of games supported it, and the quality was awful. I still really like the concept, though."
uncharted,308qcy,DefinitelyNotCake,18,Wed Mar 25 11:40:27 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty tired right now and may be wrong anyway, but the ring as far as I know, was Nate and Elena's wedding ring, which, he ditched after a large fight because he was not willing to give up his action filled life style. The end scene is essentially them reigniting their romance. But I agree that it's not the most satisfying ending, especially when compared to U2."
uncharted,308qcy,Donman118,7,Wed Mar 25 11:46:17 2015 UTC,"The ending to U2 was fantastic. U3 was great also. U1 doesn't really stick out in my mind as much as the other 2, though."

uncharted,2zy1lx,redstyles,4,Sun Mar 22 21:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Nate is around 34-35 in Uncharted 3. He was 14-15 when he met Sully, and they frequently talk about knowing each other for 20 years, so assuming that 20 years is exact and they aren't just rounding up or down, that would make Nate 34-35. Uncharted 4 takes place 3 years after 3, making him 37-38. Could be a little older, if that ""20 years"" wasn't exact. Probably early 40s, in that case."
uncharted,2zy1lx,Lovtel,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:37:33 2015 UTC,The wiki states that Nate is 15 when he he first met Sully. Nate met Sully in 1989. U4 takes place in 2014. Nate would be 40 in U4.
uncharted,2zk93s,Darkdarth33,1 point,Thu Mar 19 07:03:11 2015 UTC,"Don't have a month long game informer sit down which leads people to believe that the game is coming out this year. Also, don't release a lengthy gameplay video as these releases always precipitated a "" less than a year away"" release.  I believe Uncharted 3 had their first trailer in December 2010 - 11 months before the game was released. Gameplay videos were shown at E3 which was about 6 months from release. I think Uncharted 2 was also a November release as well. So about 5-6 month gap for U2 and U3. I don't remember specifically about U1 but I believe that they showed a demo trailer one year before the first release.   My main point is that ND set a precedent, otherwise none of the rumor mills would have come up with a late 2015 release date which is exactly what happened."
uncharted,2zk93s,stevyjohny,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that they would remember the egg on their face when The Last of Us was delayed a month from launch and be much more cautious about pushing dates. Branding it as 2015 seemed like a push on Sony's part, but even by E3, most of this ND Drama had already gone down and their were obvious shifts in the office that dramatically altered the course of the project. They could have easily reflected this by not putting a goddamn year at the end of that trailer. I'm sick to death of these nearly three-year press cycles. Six months is prime, a year at the maximum."
uncharted,2z81nq,PandaMark,6,Mon Mar 16 11:47:50 2015 UTC,There are a couple but not in Chaptet 5. I believe there is one in Chapter 6 after the helicopter fight and another in Chapter 7 when you see the tank.

Don't ruin the experience with a choppy framerate. Wait for FW 2.50 because it includes button remapping for the controller (the Uncharted games use l1 and r1 to aim and shoot instead of l2 and r2 because that's how most games did it on ps3, with 2.50 you'll be able to change this)   With that said, I'd love a remaster as well despite having spent 100+ hours over the three campaigns already (around 80 hours of that was Uncharted 2, about 40 or 50 Uncharted 3, and probably only 12-15 Uncharted 1)"

uncharted,2z11qt,ILendMyAxeToAll,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:51:32 2015 UTC,"Quite hard, I found it a little harder than hard on Uncharted 2, so it's a significant step up from normal on Uncharted 2.   Interestingly on neither game did I find crushing much more difficult than hard. This may be because for the most part, what will kill you on hard, will kill you on crushing too. So the same strategies generally prevail across both modes.   I do not recommend hard or crushing for your first playthrough because the difficulty is not conducive to a good time, and undermines how the game is intended to be played. Increasing the difficulty turns the game from fast paced, run and gun, climbing around, dynamic, adaptive combat, into a slower and more generic cover shooter."

uncharted,2ytsay,drunkadvice,4,Fri Mar 13 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"TLOU wasn't built with PS4 in mind, it's just that Naughty Dog always stores their textures and models in much higher quality than what end up in the game, and they always have extra effects they normally reserve for the cutscenes that are part of the engine and can be enabled for gameplay."

uncharted,2yodps,connorjquinn,3,Wed Mar 11 15:19:30 2015 UTC,"Hell, you could think of this is as taking the time to ensure that that doesn't happen again.    It seems to me that whatever Amy Henning and Co. were working on, Neil and Bruce came in took over, reworked, and potentially have created an entirely different experience.  I don't think it's a far fetched idea that taking these extra 6 months is an effort to fully commit to that, and go full measure with their new reworked idea."
uncharted,2yodps,zackmanze,4,Wed Mar 11 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"If the rumors are true that this is the last Uncharted, I'm fine with it.

But I do believe that companies shouldn't announce a release date or a period they are going to release a game till they are 100% sure they can release that game in that time period. Should do what Bethesda did with Skyrim announce at E3 and then bring it out the same year. avoids disappointment and is a win win situation!"

uncharted,2yodps,AntiForm30,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"Their only mistake was leading everyone to believe that it was coming out this year at some point. Now, all of those game informer articles and interviews just seem like hype because behind it was this lingering pretense that the game was close to being finished. Spring 2016 could mean March, April or May. So basically one full year at least. They messed up on that one.   That being said, U3 was definitely released before it should have been. They should not make that mistake again.  I don't plan on getting a ps4, so it doesn't affect me much. I was hoping to see the game though at least this year."

uncharted,2xac1e,NeapolitanWhitmore,3,Thu Feb 26 22:54:59 2015 UTC,I don't think this ever happened to me in 500+ games. How were they killing you? By shooting at you or with grenades? I didn't even know you could friendly fire in this game...
uncharted,2xac1e,mikwow,0,Thu Feb 26 23:03:29 2015 UTC,It was primarily shooting at me with AK. There were one or two times where I was point blank fired upon with the rocket launcher.

uncharted,2xac1e,Chronospherics,2,Sat Feb 28 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, U2 has a punishment system in-game that charges you for quitting a match. Therefore, killing teammates to get kicked is the free way out."
uncharted,2xac1e,Dead_Skull,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:50:24 2015 UTC,Odd. But I guess it makes sense.
uncharted,2xac1e,olijackson64,2,Fri Feb 27 00:02:13 2015 UTC,"On Uncharted 3 my teammates tried to kill me a few times when I had more than 70% of the kills on my team. I think they were annoyed about getting assists or something of that sort.   But, generally there's a myriad of reasons players do things like that; if they're high level and you're low, they might try to kill you, if they're bad at the game, they might try to kill you, if you're bad at the game, they might try to kill you, if they're having a bad day, they might try to kill you, etc.   It happens, it's part of online play more broadly. I would not think it was liable to consistently occur, but it may be more likely now because I imagine the players still playing are often extremely high ranked, therefore they are perhaps some of those that take the game more seriously (increased liability to kill you because you are bad, or just because you are low level).   People can be jerks, but don't let those that are make you believe everyone has their mindset. There are bounties of friendly players online."
uncharted,2xac1e,Dead_Skull,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:29:50 2015 UTC,Does every match still start with everyone throwing their grenades?

Uncharted is more about the story than the actual gameplay anyway. So if they seem like the types to skip the cut scenes move on.

uncharted,2vlq3m,KillScreenAnim,3,Thu Feb 12 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"Not in the right order, but still cool! I also loved your ""The Last of Us"" one."
uncharted,2vlq3m,AdilB101,3,Thu Feb 12 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially for Uncharted 2 I went with how I thought the scenes would blend together well over the order you play through them in the game. Thanks!"
uncharted,2vlq3m,AdilB101,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:19:56 2015 UTC,Cool cool.
uncharted,2vlq3m,Easybreath,2,Thu Feb 12 22:31:06 2015 UTC,Best thing I've seen on this subreddit in a long time! Thanks for this man!

uncharted,2vl271,AdilB101,4,Wed Feb 11 22:13:31 2015 UTC,We usually go by the tag RDT when we used to have meetups. If anyone is willing to host game days/nights I would be happy to promote them.
uncharted,2vl271,kacboy,2,Thu Feb 12 07:09:48 2015 UTC,"I would be up for hosting a UC2 night. Never done anything like that before though so I would need some advice as far as organizing goes. Like, would it be best for joiners to vote on game modes beforehand, or how does that usually work?  If it works out I'd be happy to try to make it a weekly thing."
uncharted,2vl271,kennycharter,2,Thu Feb 12 16:58:41 2015 UTC,Nice! But I'll think there needs to be another post for that.
uncharted,2vl271,LyricalFluffer,3,Thu Feb 12 21:55:42 2015 UTC,I'm down to play with you guys. My psn is the same is my username here. Hit me up if yall wanna roll

uncharted,2vcyue,TheOsttle,4,Tue Feb 10 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, there was a sort-of hint in this direction when Sony announced the YouTube clip upload feature in the 2.00 system update. They showed the feature with this photo which clearly shows an Uncharted 2 scene (chapter 18, if I recall correctly). So there's hope!"
uncharted,2vcyue,planetfifa,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"Could this be from PS Now? I haven't used the service so I'm not sure if the share tools are available through that. I do hope that it's an indication of a remaster, though."
uncharted,2vcyue,hyperlancer,2,Wed Feb 11 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be, but PS Now wasn't available yet for everyone when the update launched, so it's still something weird to see. I still hope there's a remaster coming, though."
uncharted,2vcyue,planetfifa,2,Wed Feb 11 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"It would be cool, all 1080p and 60 fps, nothing less"
uncharted,2vcyue,EdgeEdgeBatistaBomb,2,Tue Feb 10 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"I am currently playing through the series again on my PS3. Count me among the willing-to-buy-them-again crowd, should a remastered 1-3 happen."
uncharted,2vcyue,Melyanna,2,Tue Feb 10 21:53:03 2015 UTC,"While I like the idea, I'm afraid Sony may be careful pushing out too many remastered PS3 games too soon or risk the PS4 being called the ""PS3 HD"" console. They may need a couple of really solid PS4 only games first."
uncharted,2vcyue,anon1984,4,Tue Feb 10 04:26:32 2015 UTC,They did a ton of PS2 remasters and as of the last few months thats all I've been playing on my PS3.
uncharted,2vcyue,thatguyyouworkwith,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:23:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest, not a lot of people had the ps3 rather than a Xbox 360. So they've missed out on the whole franchise. With the large number of people coming over to the Sony-side, it would totally make sense to bring one of the biggest ps3 franchises to the masses."
uncharted,2vcyue,charleboy,1 point,Tue Feb 10 15:21:05 2015 UTC,I think a redone version of drakes fortune would be cool. People being new to playstation would be confused playing a remastered #2 then skipping 3 then playing 4
uncharted,2vcyue,SaberGaze,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"I think it would be silly for them not to do it. Obviously a lot of 360 owners came over to PS4 for this gen, so I imagine a good number of them missed out on this fantastic franchise. Give all three games 1080p/60fps and give Drake's Fortune the control scheme from the other two games and it'd be golden. I would be ecstatic if they ended up including a Golden Abyss port as well.  I've played the series more times than I can count, but I'd gladly give Naughty Dog more of my money for a remastered collection."
uncharted,2vcyue,Swarley133,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"Didn't Naughty Dog say late last year that there were no plans for this?   I'd love to be able to play them on my PS4 and catch up on the story but it doesn't seem like that'll be the case so I'm hoping for some sort of companion media (a video, an in-game journal, something like that) to catch the newer players up with the series.  ND are the kind of developers I'd back in to know how to handle it for the players who may have missed one or all of the first three games. There is a bit of a risk of oversaturation with HD PS3 games but it would nonetheless be heartening to see them offering a hint about some sort of solution for new players."
uncharted,2vcyue,cliffharrison,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:18:33 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see this happen. I have a PS4 and would love to play these games before UC4 comes out.
uncharted,2vcyue,gls2220,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:54:16 2015 UTC,Coming from someone who has played through and beat all 3 games multiple times...I would be all over this as it's my favorite series in the past 10-15 years.

uncharted,2up943,snakyaaron,1 point,Wed Feb 4 01:31:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone is going to take that whole 60fps shit out of proportion, they're NAUGHTY DOG and they've got just shy of a year to get this game optimized. It will be 60fps."
uncharted,2up943,Qirex,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"it's definitely not going to be 60fps at this point, they're going towards the direction of pushing the graphics and other systems instead of the balance they need at 60fps. it's too late for it to go back. it'll be 30fps and that's totally fine."
uncharted,2ujeph,serbanjo,8,Mon Feb 2 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, that would be awesome, but if you mean by the actual gameplay being like TLOU, I disagree. They should keep the fast paced action of Uncharted, even for DLC. If by that you meant the bond between two friends, then I agree completely!"
uncharted,2ujeph,SolidFlyTrap,4,Mon Feb 2 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, I meant the 'helping-each-other-cross-barriars-gameplay' from The last of Us."

uncharted,2ud1q5,EdgeEdgeBatistaBomb,3,Sun Feb 1 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not usually the biggest fan of Game Informer, but hearing about Uncharted is one of my favorite things and they just keep giving us more! I really do love this series of articles right now."
uncharted,2titk1,Svstem,3,Sat Jan 24 16:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a clip hunter for an Uncharted montage-maker team called DeFy, and one thing that we do is jumpsniping. Basically jumping and hitting enemies with a sniper rifle. It requires tremendous amounts of luck, timing and repetition to actually hit one, and it only gets harder with distance, since sniper hipfire goes all over the place in Uncharted 3. Jumpsnipe bullets also have the ability to penetrate surfaces.  Welp, this game i came extremely close to hitting the guy... twice. My emblem also shows in the second picture which is pretty ironic."
uncharted,2tge11,will-dearborn,-7,Fri Jan 23 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"I'm about ready for LameInformer to STFU about this game.  The wait is already long enough, they aren't helping!"

uncharted,2tffx5,serbanjo,3,Fri Jan 23 18:39:26 2015 UTC,And where can one obtain this marvelous product?
uncharted,2tffx5,LuisCordero47,2,Fri Jan 23 18:57:25 2015 UTC,I ordered it from this Dutch site:   http://www.nedgame.nl/playstation-3/uncharted-3-explorer-edition/1028210400/  I'm not sure if they ship international.
uncharted,2tffx5,odj310388,3,Fri Jan 23 19:01:21 2015 UTC,If only the Uncharted 2 special edition with the dagger was still available...
uncharted,2tffx5,Protanope,2,Sat Jan 24 01:59:52 2015 UTC,"Maaaaan it would be AWESOME to have the dagger. A couple years back I saw it going for like, $600+ on eBay, and that wasn't even with any of the other items."
uncharted,2tffx5,odj310388,2,Sat Jan 24 03:22:04 2015 UTC,"Just had a quick look and they are going for around Â£3,000. O_O"

uncharted,2tbyyc,Machienzo,2,Fri Jan 23 06:18:15 2015 UTC,"It annoys me when people call the actors in these games voice actors. They're not just doing the voice, they're doing the whole performance. They are actors, not just voice actors."
uncharted,2tbyyc,morphinapg,4,Fri Jan 23 04:33:20 2015 UTC,We can call them mocap actors
uncharted,2tbyyc,MarsLumograph,3,Fri Jan 23 12:19:47 2015 UTC,They're just actors. There's no reason to categorize it.
uncharted,2tbyyc,morphinapg,2,Fri Jan 23 12:35:20 2015 UTC,The voice actor of Tenzin was different than the main actor. :/

uncharted,2t9749,Qirex,2,Thu Jan 22 10:45:52 2015 UTC,Hilarious at some moments.
uncharted,2t9749,Murphy34,2,Thu Jan 22 15:29:32 2015 UTC,The one by these guys always makes me laugh my ass off. At least watch from 3:39 onwards. That was the first time I had heard of this game and it's hilarious. Even funnier is the fact that Troy Baker actually did voice work for this game.
uncharted,2tcdsi,creative-heart,10,Thu Jan 22 23:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. Uncharted 3 is a fantastic game. For me Uncharted 2 is the better all round game in terms of story but, seriously, play the game. Promise."
uncharted,2tcdsi,shep66,-6,Thu Jan 22 23:38:03 2015 UTC,the spiders though.
uncharted,2tcdsi,uhleckseee,3,Thu Jan 22 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think spiders are a big part of the game. It's been a while since I've played U3, but from what I remember it is later into the game and used sparingly. I don't think it'll be that big of a deal."
uncharted,2tcdsi,uhleckseee,-2,Fri Jan 23 00:54:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the actual help. I might just youtube it and see for myself, thanks though."
uncharted,2tcdsi,uhleckseee,2,Fri Jan 23 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"Put it this way: the spiders in U3 are not as prominent as the ""zombies"" (wow, it's seriously been a while since I've played, cannot remember who they were) from the first game. I was super creeped during the first game, hearing things crawling through the underground, but not creeped out during the spiders in U3. So, take that for what it is. If you've played the other two, you should play the third. Don't skip it and wait for the next one."
uncharted,2tcdsi,uhleckseee,-2,Fri Jan 23 01:56:34 2015 UTC,"how bad are they as enemies, visually and attack wise? are there loads of small ones in caves?"
uncharted,2tcdsi,3RDRANGER,2,Fri Jan 23 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, I don't remember. I don't think you fight them too often, and if it's what I'm thinking then I can't really say without spoiling anything. A certain character ""has"" them, I think, and you basically have to get away, or jam on a button, or something to that extent.  Disclaimer: I've played U3 through ONCE, when it came out. So, yeah."
uncharted,2tcdsi,shep66,2,Fri Jan 23 02:01:09 2015 UTC,"wow, that sounds way less horrible then what i've read online, thanks!!"
uncharted,2tcdsi,colef10,2,Fri Jan 23 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"I say play it through, especially if you enjoyed the first two. Then when you get to spider parts, figure out if you want to continue. But from what I remember, they're late in the game."

uncharted,2tcdsi,Mr_JMarston,1 point,Fri Jan 23 02:06:29 2015 UTC,"Uncharted 3 is a T for Teen game (in North America) so nothing gory or violent happens to Drake when he gets killed by the spiders. If you get to a certain part with the spiders (not spoiling what or when it happens, though), pressing Square will make Drake brush off the spiders, helping you to take less damage.  Also, there's a medal kickback in multiplayer where you can transform into a swarm of spiders, although in my opinion it sucks as they are slow and they can't climb up walls."
uncharted,2tcdsi,DerekStu,2,Sat Jan 24 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"Having replayed UC3 recently the only interaction with the ""spiders"" is running away from them and, spoilers, shooting them with a shotgun in one escape scene and fending them off with a torch later in the game. That's it really. Not actually sure that they are spiders though. Aren't they scarabs or something?"
uncharted,2tcdsi,bensawn,0,Fri Jan 23 18:02:04 2015 UTC,Why haven't I visited this subreddit sooner? You guys are amazing!
uncharted,2tcdsi,Mohob,6,Fri Jan 23 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Uncharted 3 is the best Uncharted IMO and is without a doubt worth your time. I believe people say UC2 is better than UC3 because it was a MUCH bigger leap in quality from its previous game. As a result of that, I think there was a much bigger ""wow"" factor at the time. There were so many things in UC2 that hadn't ever been seen in video games (the train seen, graphics, etc.)"

U3 is one of the most critically acclaimed games on the PS3. it had near universal praise. IGN gave it a 10/10 and it holds a 91.78% on gamerankings.com, which is a review aggregator like rotten tomatoes. seriously, how did you ever get the impression it is anything other than amazing?  more importantly though- yes. play it. it is fantastic."

uncharted,2swbi8,PcFish,2,Mon Jan 19 16:42:10 2015 UTC,I miss the 92FS from Uncharted 2. You could kill someone across the map with it almost as easily as you could with a dragon sniper.
uncharted,2swbi8,ShitYourselfForFun,3,Mon Jan 19 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there would be entire matches I would play without even touching a long gun."
uncharted,2swbi8,PcFish,8,Mon Jan 19 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"Get rid of power plays. Or at least only have one per game, but definitely no double damage power play, fuck that.  I'd like to see more things from the campaign make it into multiplayer. Like the jet skis from Drake's Fortune. How cool would it be to ride around on jet skis and shoot at each other?  There were a lot of special holiday events in U2 with double (or more XP) and everybody had the same skins, donut drake & donut lazarevic for thanksgiving and skelzor & dead explorer for Halloween, the soccer jerseys for Flynn and Drake during the world cup and Santa/elf hats during Christmas. I don't know if Naughty Dog did that for U3 or not because I didn't spend as much time playing it as I did U2, but I always enjoyed them in U2 (except the chain reaction boosters during double XP).  More kickbacks. I can't think of any new ideas for kickbacks atm but it would be fun to have more options to choose from."
uncharted,2swbi8,ShitYourselfForFun,8,Mon Jan 19 18:53:47 2015 UTC,The return of the horde survival mode from Uncharted 2. Me and 2 other guys vs 10 rounds of bad guys. I lost hundreds of hours to that mode.   If I remember correctly from my brief time with U3 multiplayer there was no option to strictly play horde mode and it was instead intertwined with other types what would switch from round to round.
uncharted,2swbi8,Zook024,6,Mon Jan 19 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"Not one single trophy related to multiplayer, that's what."
uncharted,2swbi8,DerekStu,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:24:00 2015 UTC,Agree!
uncharted,2swbi8,kennycharter,7,Tue Jan 20 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"Co-op. I love it. I want wave survival with up to 6 players and lots of enemies.  Team Deathmatch that is more team oriented, like TLOU factions MP. Stick together, be smart. 8 player Elimination across a huge map. Think dense jungle and massive caverns. You'd want to be really stealthy to avoid being killed. This mode would typically take about 20 minutes per session. Co-Op story missions."
uncharted,2swbi8,SolidFlyTrap,2,Mon Jan 19 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"That elimination mode sounds really cool! As long as it doesn't end up as Battlefield - Uncharted, I think that'd be a ton of fun."
uncharted,2swbi8,mrjustice7,4,Tue Feb 3 04:32:26 2015 UTC,"I really like the amount of gamemodes, but more co-op missions would be awesome.  The lab is pretty great so more of that."
uncharted,2swbi8,colef10,3,Mon Jan 19 19:07:50 2015 UTC,1.More guns! 2.Multi-layered levels like we saw at PS Experience 3.The rope we saw at PS experience. There would be a ton of cool shit you'd be able to pull off while using that thing. 4.From what ND has said it seems they will being adding more tools than the rope and piton. So possibly those too 5. All new maps. Uncharted 3 used a bunch of Uncharted 2 maps. I want all of them to be brand new this time.
uncharted,2swbi8,rgbaba,3,Mon Jan 19 20:17:46 2015 UTC,Three-Team Deathmatch in Uncharted 3 was all I ever played. I would load up with my buddy and play for hours. I would absolutely love to see it return.
uncharted,2swbi8,the_Ex_Lurker,3,Mon Jan 19 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"Larger, more immersive maps for me thing. Uncharted 3 has some of the best multiplayer maps I've ever seem from an art design perspective The little you barely see (like the paintings on the London Underground ceiling) are awesome. More natural environments like a thick jungle would be awesome though. Also, power plays can fuck off. All they do it annoy the winning team and rarely help the losing side make a permanent comeback.   Other than that, continue to improve on the excellent cinema mode and don't get too annoying with the micro-transactions like Uncharted 3."
uncharted,2swbi8,stevyjohny,2,Tue Jan 20 03:01:17 2015 UTC,"I wish they just focus on making it simple and accessible like 2 was. For the amount of the time they claimed to spend on 3, it didn't feel like much of an overhaul and even felt worse in other areas. For example, the ""action set piece"" level was a cool idea but they just weren't very fun. They got old after about 5 minutes. Spawning on the trucks was just unfair as there was no cover and people in the plane instantly killed you. It was also kind of glitchy. They should stay away from that kind of stuff unless they can really get it right."

uncharted,2swbi8,Murphy-115,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:50:42 2015 UTC,Might be a controversial topic (I have no idea what the general consensus is on it on here) but I'd prefer a lower TTK. I think the high TTK in this game makes it harder for newer players to go up against the veterans in this game who are extremely good at controlling the recoil and have generally better guns/unlocks. I wasn't a complete noob at the multiplayer and got to about Level 30 On both UC2 and UC3's multiplayer but I always found it tough to go up against all the high ranked players whenever I played and the long TTK always felt annoying when it was clear they had the advantage in gun fights and it always made me think god it must be offputting for people just starting out on the multiplayer. A higher time to kill usually leads to more inconsistencies such as 'I shot him a few times first and din't miss any bullets yet he still killed me' imo

uncharted,2ssd5w,colef10,9,Sun Jan 18 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that 30 is better in any way for anything, no matter what genre.  I would love to see Uncharted 4 reach 60 so much; granted the first three games were 30 and were still outstanding but I feel that 60 would add to the experience.  The 60 fps test footage for Uncharted 3 was amazing and showed potential, but 60 works better at higher resolutions with higher res textures and volumetric lighting.    TLoU Remastered looked far better at 60 than the original at 30 in my eyes, and added to the immersion such that I almost felt like I was there during the cutscenes.  The same goes for inFamous: Second Son and inFamous: First Light with their fps caps.  I would rather Naughty Dog sacrificed a little in order to get it to 60 fps than than the other way around."
uncharted,2ssd5w,emperorpopeatine,2,Sun Jan 18 10:29:31 2015 UTC,I want it at 60fps.
uncharted,2ssd5w,AdilB101,2,Tue Jan 20 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"I'd like ND to try reasonably hard to get UC4 to 60 fps. TLoU:R looked REALLY good with that frame-rate; switching to 30 fps almost made it look sluggish/clunky. If the 60 fps really compromises the player experience, just give us the option to switch to the 30 fps."
uncharted,2ssd5w,iwreckyoubabe,2,Sun Jan 18 23:39:34 2015 UTC,I still play the first 3 games happily. The only complaint I have is about the waves of pirates in the first game and thats about it. Fps have never made me enjoy a game more or less (not including massive drops in frames). It's the content of the game I enjoy.

uncharted,2ssd5w,PuppetBreakdown,0,Sun Jan 18 21:37:25 2015 UTC,I honestly did not see a difference between 30 or 60 while playing TLoU remastered. I did see a difference when the camera was moving fast (holding the right analog stick to the right) but other than that textures were smooth and it was enjoyable..  very likely that it's because my friend has a screen designed for gaming - I played LoU on his TV
uncharted,2ssd5w,Salute_The_Bud,0,Sun Jan 18 04:44:58 2015 UTC,"Uncharted is so good you don't even care about the fps. That's the way I think of it.

uncharted,2s98ul,forwaterr,5,Tue Jan 13 09:12:24 2015 UTC,Uncharted as a series means so much to me that I'll probably get the game even if it is terrible. That said I actually trust Naughty Dog quite a lot so pre-ordering doesn't scare me as much as it does for other developers.

uncharted,2s2bgt,mrlowe98,1 point,Sun Jan 18 06:02:55 2015 UTC,Yeah but I interpreted it as they actually were demons (remember Talbot pulling that big container out of the water) and the water just lets people see it as it is.

uncharted,2s2bgt,Sir_Llama,1 point,Sun Jan 11 20:39:13 2015 UTC,I think Talbot can do stuff like that because he's kind of a badass. It's not impossible to do stuff like that in real life with the right training.

uncharted,2s0i2p,qwertyuiop357,1 point,Sun Jan 11 05:36:33 2015 UTC,"ME3 definitely had the best gameplay. When I think about it, the premise behind ME3's story (ie go around the galaxy from here to there and get shit) is kinda lame, but somehow, the atmosphere was much better, especially during the last mission."
uncharted,2s0i2p,bensawn,2,Sun Jan 11 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"theres really no filling the void, they are in their own category of great.   that said, you can play the jak and daxter collection. some similar mechanics, great story telling, and that naughty dog level of polish. also similar is the ratchet and clank franchise- a peer of jak and daxter but with a shooter emphasis. definitely a blast.  theres the assassins creed games that are a lot of fun to explore buuuuut the plot is a little wacky. definitely fun though."

I did buy Tomb Raider because it reminded me of Uncharted."

uncharted,2rvz58,MartyMcPhly,16,Fri Jan 9 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"Nah, it really should be Elena's voice actress"
uncharted,2rvz58,JadedDarkness,3,Fri Jan 9 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"oh wow, she's a knockout, she should TOTALLY play the same character in the movie."
uncharted,2rvz58,betterbutterfly,3,Fri Jan 9 22:39:29 2015 UTC,Will actually cry in a corner if Emily Rose isn't cast in the uncharted movie.
uncharted,2rvz58,BeauL83,-4,Sun Jan 11 17:35:12 2015 UTC,Let's be realistic. This is a multi-million dollar big budget Hollywood motion picture. I love Emily Rose and she's obviously (intentionally) a spitting image of Elena but they're never going to cast her the same way they would never cast Nolan North as Nate.
uncharted,2rvz58,oorheza,10,Fri Jan 9 23:04:13 2015 UTC,Well unlike Nolan North she's an actress who's been acting on TV for years. She's completely qualified to play Elena Fisher in the movies. I mean DC hired a stage actor with little to no movie experience to play Cyborg for the Justice League movie. Nolan North mostly does voice work and that's why he would never get the movie roll to play Nathan Drake.
uncharted,2rvz58,gman311,5,Fri Jan 9 23:18:13 2015 UTC,He also doesn't really look like Drake. Elena was modeled off of Emily iirc.
uncharted,2rvz58,Alsharad,-1,Sat Jan 10 01:22:52 2015 UTC,Very well aware.
uncharted,2rvz58,IamJhil,-1,Sat Jan 10 02:18:27 2015 UTC,I never said she wasn't qualified. And I'm well aware of her acting credits.I'd love for it to happen as much as anyone. But I just don't see it happening. It's a fanboy pipe dream.   Have you seen the list of names they're considering for Drake (as revealed in the leaked emails from the Sony hack)? That should give you some indication of what kind of movie they're setting out to make here with Uncharted.
uncharted,2rvz58,Echo9Eight,2,Sat Jan 10 02:23:29 2015 UTC,Emily Rose is not just a voice actor like Nolan North. She's the star of the TV show Haven

I'd recommend Infamous. Only $30 for the (PS3) Infamous Collection, which contains: Infamous 1, Infamous 2, and Infamous: Festival of Blood. I really enjoyed the gameplay, and there's not an overwhelming amount of story (no more than Uncharted).      I also very much enjoyed GTA 5 (but not GTA 4), The Last of Us, and Portal 2."

uncharted,2rs2f5,Melyanna,2,Thu Jan 8 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"Uncharted was the first series I got hooked on, since then I've gotten hooked on Assassins Creed. Looking back at how I thought Assassins Creed was and how it turned out being was night and day, though it could be because I started with Black Flag and played them out of order.   Off topic question: I bought a PS4 recently is it worth buying Last of us on PS4? I have it on 3 just haven't played it yet. Same with Tomb Raider I have a used copy on the 3 but now that I have the 4 should I upgrade before I play or is it pretty much the same."
uncharted,2rs2f5,DerekStu,2,Thu Jan 8 23:11:44 2015 UTC,People are pretty positive on the TLOU remastered. I'd maybe ask/search over in the tomb raider sub about the PS4 version.

uncharted,2rn5if,Qirex,2,Thu Jan 8 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"Well no, he has a point though. In previous Uncharted's, AI teammates would sit back and let you (Nate) do all the stealth work, then once you got spotted they'd join in (with the exception of the museum in Uncharted 2, but even there Flynn would wait back until you initiated a kill, then he'd run in and get the second). By saying that Sam will work like Ellie, I assume it means he will actively follow you during stealth encounters, which very well could mean the same immersion-breaking annoyance.   TLoU of one of my favorite games of all time (tied with Uncharted 2) but that was definitely my biggest (only) gripe. It was especially bad in Bill's Town, since his boots were so damn loud it just felt silly stealthing with him around.  All the new info for UC4 sounds phenomenal, but I share the same concern as /u/link22258."

uncharted,2rnosd,zackmanze,1 point,Fri Jan 9 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of the list except for the melee. I'm not saying melee is perfect as is, but adopting a system like the last of us would be silly. Weak melee works in the last of us because bullets are so rare. Melee weapon pickups make sense because they were in the campaign and are part of the whole crafting dynamic.   Uncharted melee should be changed in other ways. First change the rifle butt to punches to keep continuity with the campaign. Then perhaps have a two step system - the first punch only stuns, no damage. A second follow-up punch kills. If initiated from the front, after the first punch the one being attacked has a split second to counter, like in campaign. Melee from the back would result in a one hit stealth kill as always. Fundamentally the counter system would work similar to battlefield 4. This would remove the ""shoot punch"" combo.   Maybe not the best fix but it's the first that came to mind."

uncharted,2rj7cz,kennycharter,1 point,Tue Jan 6 17:46:37 2015 UTC,I keep seeing articles about this but I was under the impression that it was common knowledge that the story progresses in real-time between games.
uncharted,2rj7cz,Qirex,1 point,Tue Jan 6 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I wonder how much story they will actually give away in the issue. Obviously, there won't be any spoilers but they said they would explain the Drake has been up to since that time. No mention of Elena or  Sully though, but I don't really have much of a response about that. I'm sure she will be in the game at some point. But if she doesn't fit then maybe they should leave her out. It seemed like in U3, everyone was shoe horned into the game awkwardly especially Chloe. I like her character a lot but she served almost no purpose and then she was suddenly jerked out of the story to make room for Elena. Fan favorite Charlie didn't make it through either but he got injured. With Chloe, they just jerked her out of the story completely."
uncharted,2rk8ho,lightingking500,2,Tue Jan 6 22:25:57 2015 UTC,I would say that's in the ballpark.

But yeah, I realize the design is that much more advanced...and it looks amazing, don't get me wrong. The textures and detail are unreal. He's almost hard to distinguish as not a real human being in some of the stuff they've released. That said, he doesn't even look like the same dude. Not necessarily in nationality as you mentioned but just in his features. The old Nate had an everyman quality to him. This new Nate has like a hardened, super chiseled look. Like I can't imagine this new dude being sarcastic and quipy like the old one...or even smiling! It's almost like the designers had a difficult time transitioning his old look into a more life-like design and so this is what came out."

uncharted,2rc19j,The_Unitologist,8,Sun Jan 4 21:24:43 2015 UTC,I honestly believe any adaptation would harm the franchise. It's so well crafted as it is that there's nothing a film version could add or improve upon. The only thing I think would be a nice idea would be if Naughty Dog themselves did CG movie and kept the characters we know and love intact. That way we get to keep Nolan North and not have an ageing Nathan Fillion or annoying Bradley Cooper sulley (pardon the pun) Nate.   That's just me though. I'm sure there are loads of you that would cry out for this flik but I'd like to leave well enough alone on this one.

uncharted,2rc19j,colef10,0,Sun Jan 4 22:30:29 2015 UTC,I agree that a CG movie would be a good idea. Although I think the adaptation would be different from the last of us in that its filling the indiana jones void where tlou had a one off similarity in the movie. The Road.

uncharted,2r0ber,ArcticFr0st,2,Sat Jan 3 07:11:58 2015 UTC,"Every Sony exclusive 1st party game thus far (except the launch titles) has had a photo mode.  Mandatory photo modes seems to be part of Sony's content sharing directive.  So expect one in Uncharted 4 and possibly Until Dawn and The Order 1886 (if the frame rate can handle it that is).  And yes, before someone points out the obvious I know Shadow of Mordor isn't a 1st party exclusive, they probably just saw the awesome photos coming out of Second Son and thought it would be fun to implement something similar.  I honestly thought ""next-gen"" GTAV would do the same since the in-game Snapmatic is pretty restrictive.  Imagine driving in front of a train and pausing the game mid-explosion and moving the camera through the suspended piece of debris...oh well, at least the people who made Shadow of Mordor don't think they're ""too cool for school""."

We know Drake is going to live through that because the game is only half over, but he doesn't. Every new screw up is going to catch him off guard and surprise him the same is every old one. Say, someone punches you in the face at random in different intervals if your life. You'd still flinch that thousandth time someone popped out of nowhere to punch. I don't mean to sound nitpicky, but if that's the only complaint you have after seeing the test footage, I'd say this is going to be one awesome game."

uncharted,2ps6wv,AdamMcwadam,3,Fri Dec 19 12:54:54 2014 UTC,Yeah I suppose. He looks younger in the gameplay as well so maybe the story jumps around time a bit. Also the map for the first trailer showed more than one location. At the end of the day it's Naughty Dog.
uncharted,2ps6wv,Onsiterecordings,12,Sat Dec 20 00:59:11 2014 UTC,I'm not concerned. We could still be a year away from release. They'll drip feed us other locations before release and leave a couple unrevealed to surprise you with too.
uncharted,2ps6wv,elpedro84,6,Fri Dec 19 13:54:00 2014 UTC,They probably only have one area polished enough to show it off.  Each of the other games had multiple locations.  Even the first one if you count the caves/tunnels.  I am sure this game is not going to take place entirely in one jungle.
uncharted,2ps6wv,MailKChimp,5,Fri Dec 19 15:03:16 2014 UTC,"I may be alone in this, but I actually hope the game is almost entirely set in the island jungle environment we've been seeing. I loved Uncharted 3, but sometimes the game felt like a big rush to get us through as many big unique set pieces as possible. Compare that to The Last of Us, where there wasn't really any of that. You really felt like you were just moving through your own small part of a much larger world, discovering it at your own slow pace. It seems like that's what they're going for with this game, and I love it. This is Uncharted, man, I want to feel hopelessly dirty and lost in the jungle."
uncharted,2ps6wv,CheesyWhales,3,Sat Dec 20 00:00:29 2014 UTC,"Dude, you're reading WAY too far into this. They haven't made a bad Uncharted game yet, and Naughty Dog has been on an absolute roll.

uncharted,2ps6wv,colef10,3,Sat Dec 20 00:05:35 2014 UTC,The way setting progressed in Uncharted 2 was great. I am not a fan of globe trotting because it just feels like a cheap way to introduce new settings instead of just evolving them.
uncharted,2ps6wv,scumblebee,3,Sat Dec 20 03:50:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah I feel like Uncharted was the perfect balance between the games. It went to different locations, rather than staying in one like Uncharted 1, but it also made the places they were going natural and relevant to the story, unlike Uncharted 3. Either way it is my favourite game series and I am so hyped."
uncharted,2ps6wv,arcalumis,2,Tue Dec 23 00:49:21 2014 UTC,True.
uncharted,2ps6wv,colef10,2,Tue Dec 23 20:56:46 2014 UTC,"If you go to the official website unchartedthegame.com its says this about the game ""Several years after his last adventure, retired fortune hunter, Nathan Drake, is forced back into the world of thieves.

uncharted,2ps6wv,mrjustice7,2,Tue Dec 23 21:54:43 2014 UTC,"I think it'll have the same travelling feel, I just hope it's more like Uncharted 2. The flow felt much better to me than in 3. It's a pretty hard thing to explain I guess, 'cause it is just a feeling.  But like 3 is, y'know, Here, there, explosion, woah a thing! New area! Don't get me wrong, i freaking love all the games. Just...the pacing, the flow, the transitions of two felt much more coherent to me.

It's the same in photography. You could take a picture at sunset and it will look amazing, but if you took it in the middle of the day it wouldn't be as great."
uncharted,2p53fz,morphinapg,10,Sat Dec 13 03:15:52 2014 UTC,I like to point out the differences in Watch Dogs when it's dark and rainy vs daytime and sunny. It's like an entire generation's difference.   There's a reason Jurassic Park did most of their CGI in dark and wet conditions.
uncharted,2p53fz,Qirex,9,Sat Dec 13 13:54:32 2014 UTC,"I'm glad you used a comparably high-quality still from it. Everyone else is grabbing the mpeg'd-to-death stream screens or badly lit moments.  Both of these moments are incredibly well-lit and the only reason the rest of the demo isn't is that you can't have perfect angles with a free-moving camera. Cutscenes, (and these are in-game) have the locked cameras and canned animation, much less to process/predict which allows for more detail."

uncharted,2p1l8s,kacboy,4,Fri Dec 12 06:07:33 2014 UTC,"I'm a bit disappointed - Uncharted 2 had one of the best video game scores of all time imo. But I'll reserve final judgement until we've heard more of course.  I hope Jackman can keep the tone of the series. I want the score to be memorable, not just standard Hollywood bombastic inspired sounds. I do believe Naughty Dog has excellent music direction though to help out the composers. They haven't faulted yet with either Greg Edmonson or Gustavo (didn't have a ps2 or ps1 so I'm not sure on Jak or Crash)  I also really, really hope they have Nate's Theme 4.0. It's as iconic to the series as the Indy theme is to Indiana Jones and I really can't imagine a more fitting main menu song."
uncharted,2p1l8s,indecisiveprick,1 point,Fri Dec 12 19:27:10 2014 UTC,I certainly wouldn't have chosen Henry Jackman if it were up to me. I think he's more suited to light animated films like Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6 than something like Uncharted.

uncharted,2p1l8s,Peekabooya,1 point,Fri Dec 12 12:58:35 2014 UTC,"I think that it'll be great. There were still the classic horns in that PSX gameplay demo alongside some nice new tonality.

uncharted,2p4abm,morphinapg,2,Sat Dec 13 01:52:47 2014 UTC,Yeah but they still use model swaps. You can see that in the PSX demo.

That the game isn't actually going to look like what it did 6 months before hand, once it's in use? My god.  That might explain why car companies wash and shine up their cars before an auto show, or how restaurants take nice pictures to display their food!  Thank the gods for this article.

uncharted,2oznpa,ForceEdge47,9,Thu Dec 11 17:38:47 2014 UTC,"I can definitely see all of your points. I totally understand. I lean more towards 2 myself because the longevity of it felt like a more satisfying package overall. However, some people like to say Uncharted 3 is a step down from 2, but in my opinion they are pretty durn close to being on par.   Plus, Uncharted 3's multiplayer has a lot of nice improvements to 2."

uncharted,2oznpa,bensawn,7,Fri Dec 12 05:24:51 2014 UTC,"i respect your opinions, but i 100% disagree.  above all else, these are supposed to be games. uncharted 2 had more to play. uncharted 3 focused far more on set pieces and story moments. not that these were bad at all, but as a game -which, as cinematic as these games are, they are still games- uncharted 2 was just a better game. better levels, better balance of story, action and puzzles.  i love uncharted 3, but it got lost too much in its own plot and a lot of times it felt like i was just watching the game rather than playing it, which completely defeats the point of playing a game."

uncharted,2oznpa,indecisiveprick,6,Fri Dec 12 20:23:44 2014 UTC,"Everyone is of course entitled to their own opinions but I disagree, IMO Uncharted 2 is by far the best of the series and one of my favorite games of all time.  I have finals I should be doing so I won't go too in depth (though I may come back to edit later) but just a few short points:   I felt the opposite about length. Uncharted 2 was perfect, Uncharted 3 was too short in comparison and felt empty when I completed it. Uncharted 2 had better pacing. The balance between exploring, shooting, stealth, puzzle solving, etc felt more natural. Uncharted 3 had too many drawn out sections. For example, the game's entire first section is quite boring imo. It's not until you get to the chateau that things get interesting, but then immediately after I found the whole Citadel boring. Uncharted 2's story was more interesting to me. I really liked the mystery of Marco Polo's lost ships. Uncharted 3's adventure felt like it was mostly a rehash of Uncharted 2's (lost city) and there were several plot holes / unexplained things (Chloe getting written out and never showing up again, Talbot's apparent magic abilities which may have been explained, can't remember, Marlowe's comment about Drake not being Nate's real name this was merely never expanded upon as much as I was hoping, etc) I preferred Uncharted 2's supporting characters. Harry Flynn > Cutter / Talbot The comedy in Uncharted 2 was better. Uncharted 2 was actually hilarious. A few examples, ""Oh, no, it's not so bad. Look - I have my own bucket!"", ""You couldn't find your own ass with both hands"" ""and a map"", ""Metaphor won't pay your bills kid"", ""yeah, thanks for the input, Jeff"", etc. Uncharted 3's jokes mostly just resorted to making fun of Drake and his needless climbing, ""Alright, I'm gonna climb up the tower, find a way around, and figure out a way in for you guys"", ""or, we could just take the stairs.."" etc Uncharted 2's soundtrack > Uncharted 3's soundtrack, by a mile. Reunion > anything in Uncharted 3. Other good ones include Cornered, City's Secret, Breaking and Entering, etc More interesting locales, imo. Night museum, jungles of Borneo, urban Nepal, tropical train ride, snowy himalayas, ice caves, shambala, etc. I wasn't a big fan of Uncharted 3's locales, with the exception of the Chateau, the ship, and the desert. The game just felt like it had more love / polish put into it. Hell, I'm even thinking like minor UI designs and menus. For example, just take a look at the chapter select or cutscene select for each game. Uncharted 2 has a nice photo-esque border, Uncharted 3 has no border at all. Uncharted 2's main menu felt well designed and fit the game, Uncharted 3's main menu just felt uninspired, like an unfinished beta. Uncharted 3's ending felt like a rehash of Uncharted 2. Find lost city, city starts to collapse, escape collapsing city, watch ensuing destruction from safe point. It was exciting in Uncharted 2, but felt underwhelming in Uncharted 3. Yeti's / blue monster people > Djinn. I loved the mystery of the yetis, and they were overall more fun to fight. I found the Djinn kind of annoying tbh. Uncharted 2 stealth kills > Uncharted 3 stealth kills. There was only one type of behind the back stealth kill in Uncharted 3; the animation got old. Uncharted 2 had several to add some variety. Also, I hated in Uncharted 3 how the camera would cut and change every time you stealth killed and during hand to hand combat. It completed ruined the seamless cinematic feel and just felt cheesy.   Umm.  Well.  I should really be working on my final... didn't mean to rant so long.  I should point out I don't hate Uncharted 3 by any means btw, I was just disappointed a bit after the perfection that is Uncharted 2 :)  All 3 games FTW :D  Can't wait for Uncharted 4."

The fight scenes do something similar, but I don't think it ruins any cinematic feel and certainly didn't feel cheesy. I agree that U2 is better/more polished, but was surprised by that criticism. I don't remember thinking that was a shortcoming."
uncharted,2oznpa,indecisiveprick,1 point,Fri Dec 12 01:45:46 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, I've beaten the last of us countless times on both ps3 and ps4.   You must be thinking of something else though, because the last of us does not do what I am criticizing.   In uncharted 3, when you stealth kill someone, the camera will actually cut away from behind you and switch to a front on camera. Same with when you fist fight someone.   The last of us doesn't do this, for either stealth killing or fist fighting. It does it the way of uncharted 2 - seamless and never breaking camera.   Edit: here's an example of what I'm talking about. Note specifically: 2:47, 2:54, 3:10, 3:28, 3:39, etc. The Last of Us never did that once, unless it was a scripted moment like when you kick the guy off Ellie after the truck crash in Alone and Forsaken.  It's seems like a petty thing to complain about to most I'm sure, but it's a peeve of mine, dunno why. I just find it distracting, disorienting, uncinematic, annoying..."
uncharted,2oznpa,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Fri Dec 12 01:51:58 2014 UTC,"Ok I think I understand what you're saying after looking at a few videos. Where it cuts to another camera angle instead of just zooming in or whatever. For the most part Last of us doesn't have any cuts. But it does have some sections where there are cuts. I can't find a good clip, but if you look at the opening fight scene in the bar from U3 and compare it to car crash fight scene in TLoU you see a lot of similarities. That's what I thought you meant before."
uncharted,2oznpa,indecisiveprick,1 point,Fri Dec 12 02:16:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah it's just camera cuts I don't like, they disorient me :/  Zooming is fine. Luckily it looks like Uncharted 4 is going back to the Uncharted 2 style of a seamless camera, based off the few hand to hand kills there were in the gameplay demo."
uncharted,2oznpa,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Fri Dec 12 02:26:26 2014 UTC,"The camera cuts in the car fight were different, since that whole sequence was just a big QTE. In Uncharted 3 the cuts happen during actual gameplay. In multiplayer, finishing someone off with melee will give you a special animation half the time (like the infamous sliding nut punch) and the same camera cuts happen. Really disorienting and make it feel like I lost control for a couple seconds."
uncharted,2oznpa,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Fri Dec 12 04:52:48 2014 UTC,"Yes, this - it was even worse in multiplayer. I died numerous times because the camera cut and I lost track of the second enemy I was going to shoot after meleeing the first enemy."
uncharted,2oznpa,virtual-toast,1 point,Fri Dec 12 04:59:12 2014 UTC,Although melee in multiplayer is less than useless so it's not too bad.
uncharted,2oznpa,futureblouse,1 point,Fri Dec 12 12:16:50 2014 UTC,"I really think hand-to-hand combat looked better in The Last of Us. In Uncharted 3, since the fight scenes were much more dynamic than the basically canned finishers in U2, you could see Drake and the other characters sliding all over the place. The very close up camera angle in TLOU hid all that. It also helps that the sound effects and heavy animations gave your moves ridiculous impact, something that Uncharted 4 (sadly) doesn't seem to have in the melee either."
uncharted,2oznpa,ifeelwitty,3,Fri Dec 12 04:50:22 2014 UTC,Preach it. I love them all but U3 is my fave too.
uncharted,2oznpa,kennycharter,3,Fri Dec 12 04:00:19 2014 UTC,"Uncharted 3 was absolutely my favorite of the three. It was the most memorable for me. Even though I haven't played it for awhile, the desert sequence was one of the most breathtaking experiences I've ever had in a video game - I felt like I was there, wandering aimlessly in the desert. I also really enjoyed the part where you're wondering through a dream-like sequence and everything is all wavy and confusing. Though I enjoyed more than just those two parts (the backstory on Nate and Sully was a big thing for me), they stick out in my mind."
uncharted,2oznpa,fifty8th,2,Mon Dec 15 05:59:39 2014 UTC,My only reason for not wanting to play through 2 again is that stupid boss fight. I nearly gave up.
uncharted,2oznpa,breadrising,7,Thu Dec 11 19:31:13 2014 UTC,Haha I don't get why people have a hard time with that. Even on Crushing it only takes me 3 or 4 tries. And I find it really fun.
uncharted,2oznpa,AdilB101,1 point,Thu Dec 11 20:40:49 2014 UTC,"Agree, the hardest of the games, but while I struggled badly on the boss the first time through to the point I considered not playing it again but I found it much easier the second time trough, I think I made it trough the second time without dying."
uncharted,2oznpa,spiderk132,1 point,Thu Dec 11 21:41:32 2014 UTC,"Great points!  I love Uncharted 3 a lot and reading through your post definitely makes me want to pop it in and experience it once again (for the millionth time).  That being said, I think that Uncharted 2 still remains my favorite.  Here is how I would respond to each of your points.    Uncharted 2 was long, but it was paced just perfectly.  Naughty Dog definitely mastered the peaks and valleys of tension, build up, climax, and descent in a flawless circuit.  By the time it got to the train sequence, I wasn't thinking ""This should end soon.""  I was thinking ""Dammit, I don't want this to end anytime soon!"" And finally after nearly the entire game of building, the game sends everything to massive halt with the train sequence ending and Drake waking up in Schaffer's village.  And that's where, by all means, Drake should have said ""You know what?  I'm done."" (in fact, he does).  I think that moment exists for the player to feel as Drake would, and want to call it quits.  But that Ice Cavern sequence absolutely refueled my (and Drake's) fire.  What?  Nazi's?  Schaffer killed everyone?  Demon Yeti's?! What the hell is going on?   I think if any segment went a little too long, it's the Monastery after the village battle.  But I never felt too sick of it because it was primarily platforming and the scenery was just breathtaking.  And the closing moments in Shambala were perfect.  Uncharted 3, on the other hand, just doesn't have that same pace.  First off, it takes a while to actually build.  The opening bar fight was fun, but it certainly doesn't set things off with a BANG like the opening of UC2.  Then the ensuing globetrotting was a bit too much.  Going from England to France to Syria to Yemen, I never felt any tension actually rising since locations seemed to change so quickly.  They changed somewhat quickly in UC2, but at least it all flowed together; once they got into Nepal by Chapter 5, they stayed there for the rest of the game and used different methods to change the scenery.   I guess I'd say the killing was pretty even across all Uncharted games, but I agree, I think UC3 gave you the most set-pieces and cinematic sequences to buffer more space in between the shooting.  But I honestly felt like it went over the top.  While I thought Uncharted 2 was just the right amount of over-the-top, they take UC3 just a bit too far.  The plane and cruise ship were certainly cool, but again they felt so disjointed from the rest of the experience that you had to wonder just how many coincidences one man can run into.  I guess I just felt like adding more set-pieces, and grander set-pieces, even if it did break up the shooting, didn't really fit the game's pace.  But that's just me. I love Drake's motivation in 3.  You're right; him going to the ends of the earth to save Sully, as well as getting a picture of what Drake's life looked like growing up made the game a very satisfying tale to experience.  However, the ""story"" story itself never grasped me.  The entire mystery of Shambala just had a much tighter grip on me than Ubar.  And I think it was the fact that we kind of knew we were going to see Ubar.   To clarify, in Uncharted 1, ""El Dorado"" didn't turn out to be a lost city, but rather a golden statue.  So when Uncharted 2 came around and the doors to Shambala actually opened and we got to see this lost city in all its glory, well shit, my head just about exploded.  But, come Uncharted 3, I think we, as the players, fully expected that we'd eventually see another city, and while I enjoyed the contents of it more than Shambala (we got to spend more time in Ubar and it was certainly prettier and more unique looking), it didn't have that same ""wow"" factor that UC2 did.  And that goes for the entirety of the plot.  But I agree, the Sully/Drake moments are among the best.   I agree with this one.  In UC1, they obviously got together at the end.  But when they meet up in UC2, it's unclear what happened between them (Chloe guesses that she broke Nate's heart, but Elena seems a bit jealous when she introduces herself as ""last year's model"").  Eventually they get back together and I was disheartened to find out that in 3 they had actually married but separated.  Though it was understandable (I can see how Drake's thirst for adventure and danger would drive a wedge between them), I think a lot of fans were kind of sick of the ""will they, won't they"" dance.  So it was awesome to see them get a conclusion at the end of 3, and for that reason, I hope to christ that they are still happy together in 4 (he's still wearing his ring, so that's something). I think each game has had a different role in giving the player some insight into Drake.  In UC1, he's still a stranger to us, but we start to learn that he's actually smart, courageous, trusting, and confident.  And while he acts like a scumbag, he has noble intentions; looking out for Elena's safety, doing what he can to ensure El Dorado doesn't leave the island, etc.   In UC2, we see both a darker and lighter side to Nate.  We see more of his relationships with other ""thieves"" and hear more about his past (he's not just a treasure hunter, but a full on museum thief who has pulled heists before).  He also has little qualms about dicking others over when it comes to his own self-interests.  In fact, we learn about this in the Eye of Indra motion comic; that he was the one to betray Eddie Raja, and not the other way around.  We also see his desire for revenge; going after the Cintimani stone solely as payback to Flynn.  But we also see a heroic side creep in.  He wants to protect Elena after finding her, even as Chloe begs to leave them be.  He risks his life to carry and save a wounded Jeff (a man he has known for like 20 minutes), even though Chloe urges him to let him die.  And even after Chloe leaves Nate/Elena to die at the hands of Lazaravic, to save her own skin, he still risks his life to chase after her.  On top of that, he feels personally responsible for Tenzin's village getting invaded and goes on a crusade with Elena to rescue Schaffer, after which he decides to stop Lazarevic at all costs.  The entirety of UC2 allows the player to see two completely different sides of Drake, and his heroic side take form (it has always existed in same way, but he never had the same purpose he did after UC2).  I did love getting more info on Drake's past in UC3.  I'd say it does a good job of fleshing out Nate's character through introspection of the past; not so much through the present.  TL;DR: Uncharted, fuck yeah."

uncharted,2p1n9w,alexkidd1,7,Fri Dec 12 03:48:41 2014 UTC,"The E3 video wasn't rendered on PC nor does it look any better than the demo on a technical level. The reason why it looks looks more visually pleasing isn't better graphics, it's primarily the darker lighting and the wetter environment. The fact is, things look bloody awesome when it's night and everything's dark. That's why Jurassic Park did most of their CGI like that. It makes things look so much better. That's why those effects still hold up today. Look at their daytime scenes by comparison and they look significantly worse (although the good animation masks some of their problems)   But the polygon count, texture resolution, AA, effects, lighting and shadow quality, etc is all exactly the same.  Furthermore, a lot of the comparison screenshots are deeply flawed. They use low res highly compressed screenshots from the PSX livestream, which also had incorrect black levels. Use the high quality download from gamersyde.com with the corrected black levels, and it's a far more fair comparison."
uncharted,2p1n9w,morphinapg,1 point,Fri Dec 12 07:51:50 2014 UTC,"With all due respect sir, but the footage shown on E3 looked nothing like the ingame footage. Not even when it's night, not even when it's wet. The footage at E3 was clearly a rendered cutscene."
uncharted,2p1n9w,Woeler,2,Fri Dec 12 18:03:00 2014 UTC,"The gameplay footage never had the same lighting conditions.  The graphics are exactly the same. This is coming from someone who creates 3D graphics. The polygon count, the texture resolution, the shadowing, the AA, and the shaders were all exactly the same. It's tough to make a fair comparison as the gameplay never once exhibits the same lighting or environmental conditions as the teaser, they are the same. The images that have been posted to reddit and other places are terrible quality that don't represent the actual gameplay video whatsoever. Go to gamersyde.com and download the ""fixed black levels"" gameplay video. Download it, don't stream it. Then you'll see what I'm talking about, at least when it comes to the level of detail. The shaders are hard to tell, but if you look at the cutscene at the end (which is real-time) you can tell the shader quality is just as good as the original teaser. It's just under different lighting and environmental conditions."

It could be the brother talking to someone else who is gunning after the same treasure as him.

uncharted,2ol8dt,Boogachoog,7,Mon Dec 8 16:03:10 2014 UTC,"I have many theories, but I'd honestly like the Taken approach.   Nate's older with a family. Happily living day to day with Elena and what I predict his son.   Here's how I'd want the game to start.   Complete silence except for a ticking clock  2:35 AM  Noise erupts from downstairs  ""Nate, what is that?""  No response  "" Whispers Nate!""  ""Elena...... It's probably just a ghost or something.""  ""Will you please just check?""  "" Inhales Sigh...  I'm up...""  Nate gets out of bed heading towards the door  ""Nate!""   ""Yes, boss?""  ""Take that umbrella or something at least.""  "" Chuckles Pretty sure an umbrella's not going to stop a ghost...""  ""Uh... You're such an ass.""  "" You love it.  Alright be back in a second""  ""Be careful.""  ""Always am.""  This is where you'd take control. Stepping down the hallway you'd pass by many portraits of the family and Sully too of course (He'll be considered Uncle Sully most likely). The sound abruptly becomes more audible as you notice the light on downstairs. Creeping down each step, you head towards the kitchen. A shadow appears on the wall. Nate's nervous now. As Nate reaches the kitchen a cinematic begins to play.   Rummaging sounds  Nate peeks around the corner and sees a man from the backside looking through cabinets. He sneaks up and wraps his arm around the strangers neck.""   A low voice speaks "" Choking This is no way to treat your brother now, is it?""  Nates eyes wide open, he releases his arm. Turning the stranger around he notices   ""Sam? (I think that's the name he's saying in the demo)  What the hell? Hug each other How did you? When did, where""  ""All in good time little brother. Pats face ""  Now I'm not that good of a writer obviously, but somehow this conversation would lead to Sam telling Nate he owes him. Most likely for leaving him somewhere during a thieving operation when they were younger.   Nate would say he doesn't do that kind of stuff anymore. And Sam would reply with something like ""Well let's put it this way. If you don't help me, then I'll fill your family in on what really happened in (name of place).   Nate has a dark past that's going to be used against him.   This is so far out there, but it's honestly something I'd like to see."
uncharted,2ol8dt,Boogachoog,3,Sun Dec 7 23:37:13 2014 UTC,Oohhh I like it. Why does everyone think the brother is going to be bad though? He could be a good guy!
uncharted,2ol8dt,Boogachoog,3,Sun Dec 7 23:39:17 2014 UTC,"He definitely could be.  Once again; however, I'm going to heavily speculate lol.  This trailer released about a year ago.  http://youtu.be/_SnJPTkrD7o  I believe the voice in this trailer is Nates brother. Although a different actor I think this is what happened awhile back when Amy Henning ( creative director) was let go. The actor they had previously posted a selfie on twitter.   http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/stashwick2.jpg  He was removed from the project and re-casted.  By Troy Baker I would think.  Also Naughty Dog posted what the first dudes character would look like.  http://media.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/files/2012/01/million_poly_12-610x327.jpg  Looks very similar to Drake. I believe this to be the original character model.   So basically, the first actor was not delivering the performance they wanted. Amy disagreed and either left or was let go. Neil Druckmann (creative director of The Last of Us) steps in and hires Troy Baker.  Now here we are. Like I said though, all purely speculation haha."
uncharted,2ol8dt,breadrising,3,Sun Dec 7 23:56:38 2014 UTC,"Wow. That is a good list. See, I don't know the other guy at all, (Todd Sedwick, right? That was his name?) but Troy Baker will do a good job. Also if Elena's not in it I'll murder someone. In your personal opinion if you had to kill someone off who would it be?"
uncharted,2ol8dt,breadrising,2,Mon Dec 8 00:29:43 2014 UTC,"I have good news! If you look on the right side of Drakes journal when he has it open it says "" Call Elena"". So she's definitely in it!  Any character? Probably Cutter. If he's in it that is."
uncharted,2ol8dt,breadrising,3,Mon Dec 8 04:24:59 2014 UTC,"It better not be ""Call Elena to tell her I'm dumping her again."" Seriously, if there ever was a couple more prone to breaking up....  See, I'd kill Elena. Not cuz I don't like her or anything, but simply because she represents innocence to Nate. She's his tie to the white picket fence world, and I think it could go darker with her death. Don't get me wrong, I'd be totally pissed off if she did, but in a certain sense it would work."
uncharted,2ol8dt,LeedlePumpkin,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:30:03 2014 UTC,"Killing Elena would need to be done carefully.  I'd honestly hate for the reason to be ""Elena was holding Drake back... now he can continue adventuring... for six more, breathtaking sequels! Only On PlaystationTM !!""  I think a lot of fans think Drake deserves his rest and after 3 games of wishy washy relationship complications with Elena, it'd be nice to have them fully established.  With Neil Druckman at the helm, I completely trust him to take the story where he feels it should go.  But I hope there aren't deaths for the sake of pulling heartstrings, or worse, deaths for the sake of making Drake's life one big marketable To Be Continued."

There were so many different ledges and levels of terrain with bad guys above and below. This is the kind of level design that makes Uncharted what it is. I'm not disappointed either in the lack of a set piece here. I'm sure there will be some but I'm more concerned about the core gameplay. And it looks like they did a good job. The grappling hook is a nice extra touch. It's like ND can read my mind. I thought something like this was missing in the past games and they put it in here. I also thought the climbing looked improved before I saw the climbing pick. It looked less ""jumpy"" and he had more holds to grab."

uncharted,2oh7wb,connorjquinn,1 point,Sun Dec 7 01:39:50 2014 UTC,"Wow. This was a great gameplay trailer. I'[m disappointed with some of the reaction, a lot of people complaining about graphics and lack of a set piece. I thought the graphics looked really good but I haven't played video games in awhile, I no longer have any systems or a gaming pc. So maybe I don't have the keen eye. Oh well.  I love the layered environment here. It reminds me of the shipyard level in it's scope but even more so. If they can have more areas like this in the game, I think it will be great. Because everything in this video to me was Uncharted at it's best; Drake against all the odds surrounded by enemies with only whatever is in the environment to use for cover.   The melee system looks better although since I can't play it I'm not sure what they changed. But it looks more ""chaotic"". In U3, they tried to add a brawling feel to it. I liked it personally, but this looks more refined yet very amateur and messy as it should look. I also liked how the enemies were countering more like when Drake pulled that guy off the ledge and the guy grabbed his foot!! That was epic! I also loved watching Drake just push and shoot guys off the cliffs. That is going to be so much fun."

If this is all it takes for you to atart thinking about the non existent mothers of characterless, virtual baddies, then I don't think you should be playing violent video games."
uncharted,2ol9gl,Kuwabara_Kuwabara_,5,Mon Dec 8 15:22:47 2014 UTC,"Nathan Drake is a crazy killer that kills thousands by the game. It just comes with the territory.   I'm gonna guess you don't like playing GTA or the more realistic side that has blood and gore too?   Uncharted is pretty mild as far as it goes murder, but it didn't strike me as too intense like Last of Us."
uncharted,2ol9gl,Plug-In-Baby,2,Sun Dec 7 23:07:35 2014 UTC,"Drake isn't a crazy killer, he only does as he does in defense of himself and his loved ones. He doesn't go around killing for sport, while disregarding their humanity. He kills because as it stands in those situations, it's either them or him.  Joel, on the other hand, tortures and kills a lot in a cold-blooded fashion. But, it comes with the territory for him. He can't NOT do that because he'd fall victim to worse people in that world.   It's very easy to defend those two in a moral sense. Trevor, Michael, or Franklin; however, were much sicker in terms of how easy it was for them to kill. But that can be attributed to:  A. Franklin's involvement with gangs since he was younger.  B. Michael's experience desensitizing him after all those years taking scores.  C. Trevor's severe psychopathy."
uncharted,2ol9gl,Qirex,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:09:38 2014 UTC,"In TLOU they were mostly zombies which I don't feel bad about and horrible savages. I'm really not big on GTA though, that's just gratuitous (though it gets a pass since it's kind of a parody of western culture and what 14 year old boys think is cool)  Again, something about the screaming just made me feel like these weren't pixels but people and Drake is just be a ruthless monster. I didn't really have this problem in the other 3 games, they felt like a pulpy adventure movie, this one feels like a sad reality"
uncharted,2ol9gl,the_Ex_Lurker,3,Sun Dec 7 23:19:16 2014 UTC,"The enemies in The Last of Us have the same realistic feeling.

uncharted,2ol9gl,Lupara,2,Mon Dec 8 12:34:56 2014 UTC,"This is going to sound really stupid and minor    You're right, it does sound stupid and minor. We were shown a snippet of gameplay which gives us this decade's stock baddies: South African mercenaries who all have the same screams as they fall off the cliffs. Didn't you hear the screams of the mercenaries in Uncharted 2? Lazaravic even asks you how many men you've killed.    I couldn't help thinking that all those men have mothers in the Uncharted world somewhere and they'll never hear from them again and maybe they don't know they're working for a badguy and I just don't know   This bit reminded me of this clip from Austin Powers.   I want to play a fun adventure but I just don't really want to kill a ton of people, especially if they're going to scream they way they did.

uncharted,2oiri6,Lo-Tsen7,2,Sun Dec 7 06:01:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah sounds like a typical case of ""screw up brother that always tries to be the older, more confident one, but ends up secretly looking up to and being jealous of his younger brother for being the 'better man' and ends up always messing things up, even though, in his own twisted way, he's just trying to keep the family together.""

On the other end of the spectrum, Uncharted's action is pure escapism and spectacle that's filled with unadulterated fun because Nate gives the bad guys their due. The Uncharted stories have always been lighthearted enough to be family features had they been movies--just like the Indiana Jones films.   There is blood, though. Blood clouds for people you shoot (since Uncharted 2), and one detail I noticed in this demo is that when Nate kicks the guy grabbing onto his leg, said mercenary leaks a trail of blood from his nose."

uncharted,2ohere,LegendaryGinger,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:02:55 2014 UTC,I felt that ND tried to add too much to UC3 and that's why it didn't surpass two. But this is just the first glitchy gameplay demo. I expect to see new mechanics in the future as well as different locales. I highly doubt they'd go back to style of the original UC and set the whole game on one island. I did like the whole Tomb Raider climbing touch. TR13 took all of their mechanics from UC and UC takes new mechanics from TR13.

Naughty Dog is not going to completely redesign the gameplay for the PS4, it is already a really good game. I wonder if it is possible to create a non linear/open world game and maintain the same level of immersion and character that Uncharted and TLOU have. Those games have real cinematic feel that you kind of lose in open world games like Skyrim."
uncharted,2o5lqm,kratosgow342,12,Wed Dec 3 14:22:42 2014 UTC,Id honestly take this with a grain of salt.   Remasters seem to be all the rage currently this generation since there are a lot of converts from other systems and generally a lot of people who never played games in the series on the previous system.   With uncharted 4 supposedly being the last in the series and uncharted being one of Sony's bigger games/multiplayer games I don't see them not making a remastered trilogy.  Plus remember the last of us and them saying no they were making a ps4 version?   I fully expect a remastered trilogy before uncharted 4 hits.   I just hope that means a full remaster of uncharted 2 mp. I Fucking loved that mp while 3 slightly disappointed me.

uncharted,2ny4sa,zackmanze,-1,Tue Dec 2 01:55:02 2014 UTC,"""Tomb Raider featuring Nathan Drake"""
uncharted,2ny4sa,tacosrevenge,3,Mon Dec 1 16:02:25 2014 UTC,"Isn't that what Uncharted has been since the start? Inspired by Tomb Raider, which was inspired by Indiana Jones, which was inspired by the pulp serials from the 40's."
uncharted,2ny4sa,odj310388,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:31:01 2014 UTC,Uncharted has more of an Indiana Jones feel with the dialog and action scenes than Tomb Raider. But this looks so similar to the Tomb Raider reboot. A dark and stormy tropical island with a ship wrecked survivor
uncharted,2nutn8,hunter324,10,Sun Nov 30 17:18:41 2014 UTC,It's such a great series. Definitely my favorite in regards to story. It's got the charm and character appeal of an Indiana Jones movie that's fun to play. Sony really should hang on to this exclusive. It's a treasure. So cool you were able to share it with friends.
uncharted,2nutn8,grantly0711,5,Sun Nov 30 17:54:50 2014 UTC,It's a treasure.   I see what you did there!
uncharted,2nutn8,AdilB101,3,Thu Dec 4 23:27:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah I was round my friends house for a few days a while ago, they have always had other consoles but no PS3. So I brought mine with me and decided to show them Uncharted 2 as it was the most cinematic and exciting interns of the beginning. Well that supposed 20 minute demo I was showing them turned into them playing the whole game, and 3 months later they now have their own PS3 just so they can play them!"

uncharted,2nsta0,TheStupidareFunny,2,Sun Nov 30 00:01:10 2014 UTC,Is it possible that the whole story would take place only on a island almost like UC1? (I wouldn't like this by the way as it would be to restricted)
uncharted,2nsta0,Crucial_Bullets,1 point,Sun Nov 30 04:02:22 2014 UTC,Restricted in what way? The tomb raider reboot was on one island and didn't feel restricted to me. I doubt the entire game will be in one location and there will be some slow/story based missions like the museum robbery in 2 or the flashback in 3.

uncharted,2nnrdy,mrjustice7,5,Fri Nov 28 20:20:20 2014 UTC,"Could you give me a copy? I love to edit, am a decent writer, and I freaking love Uncharted and I'd kill to be part of your project. If you'll have me, that is."
uncharted,2nnrdy,mrjustice7,6,Fri Nov 28 21:02:31 2014 UTC,I just started it so still on chapter one but would be happy to share if you're interested.
uncharted,2nnrdy,evilclownmonkey,5,Fri Nov 28 22:43:09 2014 UTC,Completely and totally! Go ahead and message me :) thanks for doing this. I think you're doing an amazing project
uncharted,2nnrdy,evilclownmonkey,1 point,Fri Nov 28 23:02:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I like this idea. If they really like the idea, they could give you several little details that could really help bring the novelized version to life a bit more."
uncharted,2nnrdy,arcalumis,1 point,Fri Nov 28 19:49:02 2014 UTC,My fear is that if I tell them they'll give me a cease and desist notice or something.  But I guess if I'm happy with the first draft I'll do more research on what they have released and maybe contact them as well.
uncharted,2nkn79,dimipei,3,Thu Nov 27 12:14:43 2014 UTC,"Hopefully survival mode and jumping, rolling, and shooting!"
uncharted,2nkn79,caveman_chubs,3,Thu Nov 27 17:32:29 2014 UTC,"I was actually thinking about this today! I hope it's got a little story like Factions in The Last of Us, and that it's a lot of game modes. Maybe a game creator like GTA."
uncharted,2nkn79,Qirex,2,Thu Nov 27 18:00:11 2014 UTC,"I hope they don't disregard co-op. I always loved it in previous Uncharted's and now I'll finally have some friends to play with since the converted to ps4. On that note I hope they keep split screen from UC3.  As for competitive, I'm really excited to see what they cook up. I love Uncharted's competitive because there's really nothing else like it. The climbing / verticality works so well for online.  I know a lot of people want them to go back to UC2's roots with simple deathmatch, no level-unlocks, no classes, etc, but I think it's unlikely. I'm sure they'll expand on UC3's setup. It seems that all the shooters that maintain a strong, lasting community without relying on hardcore fans are games that have that sort of grind-setup. I'm ok with this, as I enjoy the model. I just hope they let us put suppressors on our guns now."
uncharted,2nkn79,indecisiveprick,1 point,Sun Dec 7 08:31:02 2014 UTC,"Would it be worth to be able to put surpressor on our guns, even though a map most likely does not even exist?   On that note: 'Do you expect a minimap in Uncharted 4?'"
uncharted,2nkn79,indecisiveprick,1 point,Mon Dec 8 06:34:31 2014 UTC,"I don't expect or want a minimap in Uncharted 4, I just always like to use a suppressor regardless because I like being stealthy and it makes me feel more badass :D  Besides, there is still the benefit of.. well, you know - suppressing sound :p  TLoU had a minimap, so it could happen I guess, but I don't expect it."
uncharted,2nkn79,x-CapedCrusader,2,Mon Dec 8 07:16:55 2014 UTC,Hopefully more like uncharted 2 multiplayer and less like uncharted 3 multiplayer.

uncharted,2mm9b4,zackmanze,2,Sat Nov 22 00:19:42 2014 UTC,wow never think of this. it probably work
uncharted,2mff9z,Chalky97,7,Sun Nov 16 01:18:02 2014 UTC,"To be honest while a good contender, technology has come so far they may as well go hyper realistic CGI and keep all the cast members the same. But then again, it would be like stitching together cut scenes so there's that :/"
uncharted,2mff9z,AdamMcwadam,7,Sun Nov 16 02:36:07 2014 UTC,I'd much rather have that so Nolan North can voice Drake
uncharted,2mff9z,Yosonimbored,2,Sun Nov 16 16:40:36 2014 UTC,Yeah my thoughts exactly.
uncharted,2mff9z,AdamMcwadam,1 point,Sun Nov 16 16:44:22 2014 UTC,Same as (mostly) everyone  wants Kevin Conroy to voice Batman / Bruce Wayne irrespective of whoever plays :-)
uncharted,2mff9z,Ripcord999,0,Sun Dec 7 08:58:54 2014 UTC,Honestly I'd like to seen Nolan North cast even if it were a life action film. I mean he has on-screen acting experience too.  He may not look exactly like Nate but it's close enough. The voice is really as much a defining trait of the character as anything. And of course Nolan has the sarcastic attitude down perfectly.
uncharted,2mff9z,indecisiveprick,3,Sun Dec 7 08:12:36 2014 UTC,"I really like that idea and honestly is probably the best one, but knowing Sony they like to try and milk as much money from franchises as possible (see The Amazing Spider-Man franchise), so they're going to try and get some popular actors to make the film more approachable to people who don't play the games."
uncharted,2mff9z,justintime57,9,Sun Nov 16 10:39:40 2014 UTC,"My contender is Bradley Cooper. He sounds just like Drake in the Serena trailer and has the right personality, acting chops, and popularity that producers look for."
uncharted,2mff9z,evilclownmonkey,4,Sun Nov 16 06:39:30 2014 UTC,Agreed
uncharted,2mff9z,XK310,3,Sun Nov 16 07:20:38 2014 UTC,He'd really be perfect at this point. Even his voice is pretty close.
uncharted,2mff9z,morphinapg,10,Sun Nov 16 17:40:18 2014 UTC,No. It's not just about looks. He has to play the character right.
uncharted,2mff9z,Tikkito,8,Sun Nov 16 02:40:20 2014 UTC,On the other hand jake gyllenhal is a great actor. He was awesome in night crawler so I bet he could pull it off
uncharted,2mff9z,morphinapg,0,Sun Nov 16 03:59:14 2014 UTC,"He's a good actor, but not good for Drake"
uncharted,2mff9z,Tikkito,5,Sun Nov 16 05:13:24 2014 UTC,A good actor can play many roles so I definitely believe he could pull it off.
uncharted,2mff9z,morphinapg,1 point,Sun Nov 16 17:20:57 2014 UTC,"He can play many roles, but good actors don't have unlimited talent. They excel in certain areas, with certain types of characters. I don't think Gyllenhall would fit Drake at all. I think you need someone who's generally a pretty funny guy in real life to have that natural sense of comedy and chemistry with the other characters that Drake has."

uncharted,2mff9z,Namsonite,-1,Fri Nov 21 00:33:44 2014 UTC,I think that Nathan Fillian would be the best man for the job. Great actor can be serious but his comedic side would fit in with drake's character.

uncharted,2ksm0v,justintime57,5,Thu Oct 30 16:31:11 2014 UTC,"This video piqued my interest. Of all the games to show off YouTube's new 60fps playback feature, I was surprised to find out DigitalFoundry decided to demonstrate it with Uncharted 3. Of course, it's great to see any Naughty Dog game get boasted like this; but as we know, U3 ran at 30fps on PS3.   I thought this was interesting considering the newly founded rumor of the Uncharted Remaster for PS4. I'm not trying to jump to conclusions and this is likely a mere coincidence, but it's still intriguing nonetheless."
uncharted,2ksm0v,morphinapg,-4,Thu Oct 30 16:38:53 2014 UTC,"Note that it's also in 1080p. I'd say this pretty much confirms a ps4 version.   Btw, I do not like Uncharted in 60fps."
uncharted,2ksm0v,StricklyPro,3,Thu Oct 30 17:14:00 2014 UTC,Can I ask why you don't like it at 60fps?
uncharted,2ksm0v,morphinapg,-3,Thu Oct 30 17:22:20 2014 UTC,"Higher frame rates can make things feel cheaper or smaller (often referred to as the soap opera effect), and for games that are supposed to feel like movies, I really don't like that at all. They're more realistic, sure, but reality is disappointing compared to fantasy.  Lower frame rates (along with good quality realistic motion blur) make things feel larger, heavier, more impressive, etc. Obviously, you can't just keep going lower, but I feel that 30fps is within that sweet spot. Not too low, and not too high. Same for 24fps for movies/tv."
uncharted,2ksm0v,HowieGaming,7,Thu Oct 30 17:31:40 2014 UTC,"The ""soap opera"" effect is only something temporary. It lasts for a couple of minutes and then you're used to it. First viewing of The Hobbit at the premiere was like this. Everything was weird, but after like 5 minutes of looking at it, everything felt normal.  Higher framerates are just something you have to adjust to. I can obviously tell that you are not a PC gamer, where the standard is 1080p 60 fps (slowly getting higher year by year), but if you were you would NOT be writing that comment at all. Going back to play Red Dead Redemption and other fantastic console games are always a chore because of the framerate. Then I have to adjust again to get familiar with the lower framerate. Adjusting sensitivity and how long it takes to turn around in games."
uncharted,2ksm0v,morphinapg,-2,Thu Oct 30 19:38:45 2014 UTC,"The ""soap opera"" effect is only something temporary. It lasts for a couple of minutes and then you're used to it. First viewing of The Hobbit at the premiere was like this. Everything was weird, but after like 5 minutes of looking at it, everything felt normal.   Used to it, yes. Happy with it, no. I've played The Last of Us at 60fps. I played the whole game that way. Yeah I got used to it but I always hated the feel of the motion the entire time. Felt cheap. Didn't feel epic and dramatic. It lost a lot of that feeling. Every time since then I will always enable the 30fps option.   Higher framerates are just something you have to adjust to.   Like I said not everyone experiences it, or even cares, but there is absolutely an artistic reason for different frame rates. Higher frame rates are more realistic, but they lose a bit of the fantasy/dramatic/cinematic feel to them in the process. If that doesn't matter to you or if it doesn't affect you that way, that's fine, but it's not just me. Plenty of people feel this way.   It's hard to explain why it happens but think of it this way: Why would some photographers use black and white when they could easily use color? Because while black and white is less realistic, it activates a certain feeling in the viewer that color can't properly convey. Just like photographs are a visual art, video games are as well. That means anything you do to affect the visuals will affect the artistic feel of the art as well. That can be done with the way characters are designed, it can be affected with color choices, it can be affected with resolution, it can be affected by the quality of the animation, and yes, it can absolutely be affected by the frame rate.  Note: I'm not saying I wouldn't play an Uncharted at 60fps. I just think it's artistically inappropriate for that type of game. I hope if it's released they have a 30fps cap option in those as well.  Also, I think 60fps is completely fine in different kind of games. Pretty much any multiplayer will benefit, first person games almost universally benefit, anything that has an overall arcade-like feel to it, racing games, 2D platformers, pretty much most games I think benefit from 60fps. But the slower paced story focused third person games with realistic animations and cinematic direction, I just don't think it fits. I cringe when I think of Beyond Two Souls in 60fps lol.  You also don't really have to get used to it either. On a console, you have locked hardware, that means no matter how powerful the hardware is, you can always get better graphics by targeting 30fps in your game than by targeting 60fps. So most games that focus on graphics on console will still be 30fps. Even if the PS4 was 1000x as powerful that would still be true. I'm actually quite surprised Naughty Dog chose to sacrifice potential graphical improvements they could have had with 30fps in Uncharted 4.   I can obviously tell that you are not a PC gamer, where the standard is 1080p 60 fps (slowly getting higher year by year), but if you were you would NOT be writing that comment at all.   I primarily play on consoles, but I play many games on PC. In fact the last game I played on PC, Arkham Origins, I implemented a 30fps cap (adaptive vsync, half refresh in nvidia) for the same reason. Arkham isn't as bad at 60fps as Uncharted, but I still preferred 30fps.   Going back to play Red Dead Redemption and other fantastic console games are always a chore because of the framerate. Then I have to adjust again to get familiar with the lower framerate. Adjusting sensitivity and how long it takes to turn around in games.   Honestly camera control is one of the biggest things I hate about 60fps. I end up swinging the camera too fast, and that just doesn't feel very cinematic to me. So for games where I want things to feel like a movie, 60fps ruins that, even just in camera control alone. One big reason I always use a controller instead of Mouse/Keyboard when I game on PC anyway."

uncharted,2ksm0v,HowieGaming,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:42:42 2014 UTC,"This video is from NaughtyDog themselves from the time when U3 was about to release. Running on a beefed up dev kit.   I'm still very hopeful for a PS4 collection, but this is not confirming it in any way."
uncharted,2ksm0v,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Oct 30 19:33:21 2014 UTC,"The game is significantly optimized for the PS3 hardware. Even if the dev kits were more powerful, there would be no way they would be able to do 1080p60 consistently at those graphics without specifically optimizing for that devkit, which would be a complete waste of time."
uncharted,2ksm0v,HowieGaming,3,Thu Oct 30 19:41:40 2014 UTC,"Well, it isn't like the game was made on a PS3, they make em on the personal computer and probably captured it from there."
uncharted,2ksm0v,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Oct 30 19:55:15 2014 UTC,"They write the code on a PC, but the code doesn't run well on a PC because it's optimized for the PS3 hardware. They do the testing on a PS3."
uncharted,2ksm0v,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:42:01 2014 UTC,That doesn't change the fact that this video proves nothing in the way of a remastered uncharted collection. This video has been around a long time. It was released around the time the game came out.  Even in the video the guy talks about digging it up from an archive.
uncharted,2ksm0v,morphinapg,0,Thu Oct 30 21:24:26 2014 UTC,"That's odd. Maybe it's just motion interpolated (like what many TVs can do). Some pipeline error, perhaps. Is it native 1080p though? Perhaps it's just upscaled and interpolated."
uncharted,2ksm0v,odj310388,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:48:59 2014 UTC,Naughty dog themselves stated that they ran the game at like quarter speed in order to capture HD screenshots for the press and then ran the game at half sleed and sped it up to then get this 60 fps video

Could be an error, or could this lead to believe an Uncharted Trilogy Remaster? It would make sense as well, solely remastered Among Thieves would be rather strange. Especially when this is likely intended (or rather promoted) for PlayStation newcomers, much like TLoU Remastered. I'd happily purchase these games again even after getting all three at full price on release day."

If any game deserves a remaster then it's Uncharted 2; I rank it even higer than TLOU.

uncharted,2ju3wp,BlueBlur8,3,Tue Oct 21 00:49:51 2014 UTC,Tearaway is getting a PS4 port. Let's hope Golden Abyss gets one too. One problem though. There are some essential features in the game that can only be used for the Vita.
uncharted,2ju3wp,genchris,2,Tue Oct 21 06:46:39 2014 UTC,The touch screen functions can at least be used by the touch pad.  I'm a bit mixed about Vita games getting ported. Sony needs people to buy Vitas and that won't happen if all the good games keep getting ported.

Though, I think it was there to add replayability to a Vita game. Think about it. Great for a car ride. Throw it to your kid for a 6 hour road trip and he'll never leave the Vita. Maybe you should have bought him a 3DS instead. You try telling your friends and family but no one does anything. It's hopeless. He constantly screams in outbursts ""SULLY!"" He claims Nathan Drake is love, Nathan Drake is life. Next time he see's his grandad he calls him Vincent Perez. Poor grandpa. He's 90 and for the first time ever, his GRANDCHILD forgets HIS name.

They started working on the motion capture last November, and from previous game behind the scenes, the last year or so is when all that happens. They might have had to restart earlier this year when Amy Hennig and Todd Stashwick left the project, but even if they did, they could be done next spring for all we know. Note that the ""Art of the Uncharted Trilogy"" is releasing in April 2015. I think there's a good chance we'll be getting an Uncharted Trilogy remaster around that time as well, but who knows, maybe Uncharted 4 will come out shortly after that as well."

We are 8 months from June 2015 currently, 8 months before The Last of Us came out we had 2 Trailers, 5 Behind the scenes videos, 3 Gameplay Trailers, 2 Cutscene videos.

uncharted,2j7oxp,myotheruserisagod,4,Tue Oct 14 13:16:48 2014 UTC,"Recently I read about the increasing problems with these kind of cheats. Some guy that has his PS3 jailbroken, found out a way to change gamefiles during the gameplay (on his PS3-side). Doing this gave him the ability to have infinite ammo, invulnerability, to jump from level 1 first legacy to max level 5th legacy, etc. His name is/was all over the leaderboard. This is the guy's youtube channel, showing cheats like this in dozens of games.  Naughty Dog doesnt do anything about it anymore...  EDIT: How to deal with them: try to stealth kill them. The stealth kill animation is not linked to damage/actually dying. Despite him having infinite heath, the animation will start and leave him on the ground for the rest of the game (since he doesnt die, he wont respawn)."
uncharted,2j7oxp,Rocr,2,Tue Oct 14 13:53:55 2014 UTC,"You can't stealth kill them, I know a hacker who does this and fixed the neck snap. Just block him so you won't get put into games with him."
uncharted,2j7oxp,Hazdownvote,2,Tue Oct 14 15:52:01 2014 UTC,"Are you sure when he's lying on the ground after being stealth killed he's not actually dead body glitching? (where people see your body with a name tag over it and you go around invisible killing people). I've had that happen to me and it's annoying, but I've got to say it's pretty fun when it happens to you."

I'm too lazy to even bother with that stuff. One of the few advantages of a console is not having to tweak it in any way unlike a computer. It just pissed me off people are motivated to not only do it but to do it for nefarious reasons."

I know he looks more real, but he just looks so different, and i'm not talking about the wrinkles, he just looks different to the previous models. They did the same to Lara Croft on the rebooted Tomb Raider, she looked really cool, but then they made her look more real for the Definitive version, which made her look worse in my opinion."

uncharted,2ipuns,zgrove,2,Fri Oct 10 18:05:13 2014 UTC,Not off the bat. I actually doubt he is gonna overall. They've shown him die twice. It'd be more emotional if Elana or Drake die(pleasedonthurtme).

uncharted,2ipuns,theweepingwarrior,2,Thu Oct 9 19:16:03 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they've said the games take place apart in real time. So Drake was 30 in Uncharted 1, 32 in Uncharted 2, 34 in Uncharted 3, and will be around 38 in Uncharted 4.   Sully won't be dead off the bat--he's already provided voice content for the trailer and that isn't a red herring."
uncharted,2ipuns,the_Ex_Lurker,2,Tue Oct 14 17:36:06 2014 UTC,"Well he's not going top be dead for the whole game, cause he's in the trailer (not to mention the mo-cap pictures). If they do kill him off midway through the game it'd be nice if it were just old age or something else rather anticlimactic. He's already ""died"" twice in the series and I think any more dramatic death scenes would just be overdoing it."
uncharted,2ipuns,stevyjohny,2,Tue Oct 14 19:40:20 2014 UTC,UGH. I'm so desperate for a real trailer. Don't keep talking about it ND until you release it.

uncharted,2idjmu,YongganHu,2,Sun Oct 5 18:39:53 2014 UTC,Just preordered it.
uncharted,2idmyc,JimboMS,7,Sun Oct 5 19:13:01 2014 UTC,"I want more Elena, but I fear we'll get less, since Haven was renewed for a double length season this year, so she may have little to no time to record her scenes. Basically, I want it to feel like Uncharted 1 in the sense that Elena was your primary companion. Sully got his time in Uncharted 3, and it was great, but Elena gets less and less time each game so she needs more. I also hope they haven't broken up again...  Also, if they could bring back Cutter it'd be awesome!"
uncharted,2idmyc,morphinapg,3,Mon Oct 6 17:11:25 2014 UTC,"He's wearing his wedding ring still in the trailer. Betting on that she is the reason Nate is forced back into the treasure hunting life on a more ""personal"" mission."
uncharted,2idmyc,theweepingwarrior,2,Tue Oct 14 17:37:54 2014 UTC,"Wow, I feel the exact same way. I liked the story and isolation in Uncharted 1. I liked the feeling of being alone and outnumbered, far far away from civilization. I didn't get that feeling as much in the other games especially 3. In 3, the only time I felt like that was on the shipyard levels. To me, that was ""real"" uncharted. Just Nate and his wits against all of the odds, climbing and shooting. In U1, the story felt like whatever happened on the island would stay on the island. It also made it feel more detached from the world. I know it shouldn't matter because it's just a game, but I always felt like Drake got away with too much in U2 and U3. He somehow still supposedly remains anonymous despite being involved in these huge quests which leave cities utterly destroyed. Whereas in an island setting, it's much easier to have all of this terrible stuff happen without public knowledge."
uncharted,2idmyc,stevyjohny,5,Wed Oct 15 12:55:12 2014 UTC,"Definitely more Elena. I feel like she brings just as much to the Uncharted games as Sully does, she's awesome."
uncharted,2idmyc,KanesTheName,2,Sat Oct 11 01:16:38 2014 UTC,could not agree with you more!
uncharted,2idmyc,jesialtissimus,3,Sat Oct 11 11:42:06 2014 UTC,Much longer story.
uncharted,2idmyc,stevyjohny,2,Sat Oct 11 11:21:18 2014 UTC,100%
uncharted,2idmyc,jleopard,2,Sat Oct 11 11:41:48 2014 UTC,"I just want a solid story (easier said than done yes) and great action. And by great action I mean quality shooting mechanics and an expanded melee system if possible. I would prefer both of these over big set pieces which I'm sure they will probably having anyway. However, I really care more about gameplay. If I'm going to play an entire game shooting and punching, I want it to feel awesome and responsive. They have managed to change the melee system a little each time. It was the only aspect of three that I liked better than the previous two games. I just liked the counter button as it made it feel more like a brawl. In the previous two games, you would take guys down by just mashing square. U2 employed the counter but I liked it better in U3 because it happened faster and felt more sudden, again like a brawl. Some of the animations were repeated too many times in 3 but that throw-the-gun-at-the-guy-then-punch-him-in-the-face-then-catch-the-gun-again move was freaking awesome. I also loved fighting those heavily armored guys as they would counter a lot and it felt like being in a heated fist fight. It felt even more awesome doing it while things were exploding behind you. It was also fun to be able to grab guys and throw them against a wall or off of a ledge. And then last of all: contextually grabbing nearby items and smashing them into peoples faces was awesome and long overdue for the series. It worked most of the time you wanted it too despite looking a little glitchy.  So if they can make a solid story with multiple enemies to be taken down with smooth weapon controls and awesome fisticuffs, that's all I want."
uncharted,2idmyc,AntiForm30,1 point,Wed Oct 15 13:20:47 2014 UTC,More of the same but drop the multiplayer and add some more story.

uncharted,2iafxg,CoreyClarkYC93,2,Sat Oct 4 21:17:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I feel mostly the same."
uncharted,2iafxg,YongganHu,2,Sat Oct 4 22:45:18 2014 UTC,"Hopefully Naughty Dog or who ever would adapt Golden Abyss would add more to the game. It was more like Uncharted 1 than 2 or 3, but limited technology made all the set pieces feel really underwhelming."

uncharted,2iafxg,YongganHu,2,Sun Oct 5 15:00:33 2014 UTC,"It follows the same structure as the other three, I had zero interest in the different love interest, since Drake ends up with Elena eventually."
uncharted,2iafxg,theweepingwarrior,1 point,Sun Oct 5 15:02:30 2014 UTC,Sounds like the game isn't worth buying the vita...
uncharted,2iafxg,morphinapg,2,Sun Oct 5 15:09:32 2014 UTC,"It's not as bombastic as 2 or 3 (more like 1--no absolutely huge set-pieces), but it has the same scope and scale of 2 or 3.   Story is good, I'd say better than Drake's Fortune, but not as good as 2 or 3. The main villain is entertaining (if cartoony) and the supporting villain/friend is memorable and well-acted (think a New Jersey version of Eddy Raja with more screen time).  The love interest is fairly obnoxious yet charming in her own way--and while she fails to impress as a love interest as an adventure companion she is compelling in her own right. Nate and Sully are as good as ever and have some really funny banter.  The Indiana Jones-esqe pulp-adventure atmosphere is present yet more subdued than the PS3 trilogy--it feels a little more like the movie Sahara here than Indiana Jones. The environments are creative, the historical mystery is intriguing, and the actual tale is a lot of fun.   A lot of the optional tasks and sidequests present in Golden Abyss and absent in the other games make this the one game to really make Nate feel like an explorer.   Overall, it's a worthy addition to the franchise and can stand next to its PS3 brethren. Good, a lot of fun, but I'm not sure if you're better off purchasing a Vita solely for it right now with the potential for a remastered collection coming to PS4."

uncharted,2hte3g,tankerchapter,14,Mon Sep 29 19:31:32 2014 UTC,"I could believe 7 years have passed since number 3, so 42 would be my guess. Make it 43 and he's the same age as Nolan North and Nathan Fillion!"
uncharted,2hte3g,kennycharter,2,Tue Sep 30 00:15:50 2014 UTC,"Perhaps Uncharted 4 is being used to pitch the idea of Nathan Fillion as Nate on screen? I know it's suggested a lot, but he's always seemed too old. Maybe this game will be used to show that he's definitely not too old. He was definitely looking a bit like Fillion in the trailer."
uncharted,2hte3g,morphinapg,11,Tue Sep 30 18:47:28 2014 UTC,"Drake was 15 in the flashback at the beginning if Uncharted 3.  It was stated that flashback was twenty years earlier, putting him at 35 during the events of U3.  This should make him 39 in Uncharted 4 unless they are adding a time jump."
uncharted,2hte3g,OrangeLightning4,3,Tue Sep 30 03:34:57 2014 UTC,There's no time jump. The games just don't necessarily take place in the year they're released.
uncharted,2hte3g,morphinapg,6,Tue Sep 30 04:24:53 2014 UTC,"Sully said at the end of Uncharted 3 taking place in 2011, that Nate and Elena crashed his plane 4 years ago, and the first game came out in 2007. I just figure the games would match up with their respective years."
uncharted,2hte3g,OrangeLightning4,-1,Tue Sep 30 04:29:56 2014 UTC,"We don't know if Uncharted 3 takes place in 2011. However, yes Uncharted 1 to 3 is 4 years. However, it's not 2 years, 2 years like the release. Most likely it's 1 year, 3 years. In Uncharted 2 Elena refers to herself as ""last year's model"", implying Uncharted 2 takes place a year after Uncharted 1. It also makes sense that 3 years passing between 2 and 3 would give Nate and Elena enough time to date, get married, break up, and have not seen each other for a while. 3 years seems more likely than 2 for that."
uncharted,2hte3g,morphinapg,4,Tue Sep 30 04:34:31 2014 UTC,"Last Year's Model doesn't literally have to mean one year has passed. Also it would make sense for at least two years to have passed between U1 and U2. Nate managed to spend all his riches from the end of U1 in that time. But no, it is uncertain whether or not it actually takes place in its release year. All we can calculate is the time in between them."
uncharted,2hte3g,OrangeLightning4,2,Tue Sep 30 04:42:45 2014 UTC,"You don't think Drake could spend his riches in a year? Plus remember Sully had built up a lot of debt. Chances are, a good portion of it went to that as well. Anyway does it really say he's broke in Uncharted 2? He's hanging out at what appears to be a pretty expensive tropical resort.   3 years between 2 and 3 makes a lot more sense than 2 considering what happened between the two, and it's backed up by Elena's statement."
uncharted,2hte3g,morphinapg,3,Tue Sep 30 04:50:29 2014 UTC,Sully said he went through the last of Nate's money when getting him out of jail. I just think it's a safe assumption that two years passed between each respective adventure.

uncharted,2hte3g,morphinapg,0,Sat Oct 11 16:26:20 2014 UTC,"Okay that makes sense about the prison thing. They still had probably a good amount of money left, but spent most of it on bribing the prison. Based on the dialogue of the games, it makes more sense to assume 1 year, 3 year. Obviously it doesn't matter, but I just can't possibly see the stuff that happened between 2 and 3 happening in 2 years. After 2 years they were probably still newly married."
uncharted,2hte3g,OrangeLightning4,0,Tue Sep 30 05:03:39 2014 UTC,"I can easily see it happening. You under estimate just how long two years is. Nate and Elena probably had a trial marriage, but he just wasn't ready to give up on fortune hunting yet, and still was wanting to beat Marlowe."
uncharted,2hte3g,random-relay,0,Tue Sep 30 05:08:56 2014 UTC,"He looks 50 now because guys like Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale are 39 and Nate looks a lot more ragged, weathered and worn out than they do.  Uncharted 3 Drake looked like TLoU Joel pre-pandemic and Uncharted 4 Drake looks like the Joel Ellie meets...who was in his 50s."
uncharted,2hte3g,qwertyuiop357,2,Tue Sep 30 14:13:48 2014 UTC,"Not sure off the top of my head, but he ages at real time (ie he was two years older in 3 than 2), so tack on four years (assuming 2015 release) to his age in 3."
uncharted,2hte3g,qwertyuiop357,2,Mon Sep 29 22:33:12 2014 UTC,he was like 35 in uncharted 3...so he was 33 in uncharted 2 and 31 in uncharted 1? is this right?  how do we know he ages in real time
uncharted,2hte3g,morphinapg,2,Mon Sep 29 23:06:55 2014 UTC,"I saw some age figures for the first three games, and his age passed in real time. I'm extrapolating that it'll be the same."
uncharted,2hte3g,qwertyuiop357,-1,Mon Sep 29 23:41:17 2014 UTC,"Based on dialogue in the games I find it more likely that Uncharted 2 takes place 1 year after Uncharted 1, and Uncharted 3 takes place 3 years after Uncharted 2.   I also don't think Drake has aged in real time for Uncharted 4. I'm going with a 10 year estimate."
uncharted,2hte3g,zgrove,8,Tue Sep 30 04:24:05 2014 UTC,"Says this on the Uncharted wiki:  ""Hanno Hagedorn - Senior Character Artist (On Uncharted 3 Development): ""Nathan Drake is now into his third incarnation, so we felt there were opportunities for innovations in Uncharted 3.  The first thing we did was to decide how to push our ongoing focus on stylized realism for Drake. This took a number of forms in the finished model, from improved ways of creating his wet hair down to his beard stubble.  Just as we did between Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, we aged Drake up in accordance with the two to three years' real world difference between 2009, when we released Uncharted 2, and the year when we were going to release Uncharted 3: 2011. Drake was in his very early thirties when the first Uncharted was released, and so now he's well into his mid-thirties. If you look close enough you can just catch glimpses of a couple of grey hairs. We also made crow's feet' wrinkles around his eyes a little more pronounced. These details are very subtle, but people pick up on them subconsciously.""  I don't know how accurate the wiki is, but the different wiki sites tend to be pretty accurate. It is a direct quote after all."

I liked reading the wiki but I never really trusted it because I wasn't sure where the information came from. Since that quote was about the third game, it wouldn't have appeared on the wiki until the time of the release of Drakes Deception. I guess what I'm trying to say is that what I read was wrong. However, I wish ND would just release more hard facts about the characters instead of leaving us to speculate but I guess that is part of the fun..."

uncharted,2h3nru,iwasinmybunk,2,Mon Sep 22 11:49:47 2014 UTC,"i mean it would be awesome to watch a two hour feature made by naughty dog- they would have the same voice actors, same cohesive vision and style as the games.  however that said i feel like the uncharted games are kind of inherently homages to action adventure movies like indiana jones. with the right casting and the right blend of humor, epic scope, and action- an uncharted movie could come together beautifully as a live action movie.  i also feel like naughty dog would only allow a nathan drake feature to be made if it were to come together the way one of their games would (which is a very high bar of excellence). i know there was that mark wahlberg fiasco but after losing the crash property to universal IMO i feel like naughty dog might be a bit more sensitive about who gets to develop their properties."

uncharted,2gkfq8,VintageOctopus,2,Tue Sep 16 18:25:58 2014 UTC,"I think it might just be the E3 trailer shown again, because frankly TGS seems unlikely for a big reveal like a gameplay trailer."
uncharted,2gkfq8,Hazdownvote,1 point,Tue Sep 16 19:37:37 2014 UTC,They won't re-hash the old trailer. They'll put out a new one.  Seeing all these big titles like BloodBorne and Silent Hills at TGS makes me think that a new Uncharted trailer wouldn't be out of place.
uncharted,2gk32w,white_water,4,Tue Sep 16 13:29:49 2014 UTC,I think this is a sick idea. Naughty Dog would make dinosaurs so awesome. That dense rainforest we saw in the teaser is a perfect setting for dinosaurs as well. Perhaps he finds the Lost World?
uncharted,2gk32w,bgmrk,4,Wed Sep 17 05:54:44 2014 UTC,"Wow, I've actually had the exact same thought about dinosaurs being the monsters in Uncharted 4 ever since Uncharted 3 came out. Don't know why, just thought that they'd fit well with that pulp adventure thing the series has going--like a callback to all those old WWII era comics of adventurers getting stranded on ""Dinosaur Island"" or something.   I even thought there was a faint glimmer of hope when they decided to create an animated Raptor's head as a mask in U3's multiplayer. Like they were trying it out.   But I doubt it will manifest into anything. The last game is pirate themed and I have a feeling we'll see ghosts or ""Jason and the Argonauts"" skeletons first."
uncharted,2gk32w,theweepingwarrior,5,Wed Sep 17 15:43:41 2014 UTC,I think your opinion of the monsters in the games is pretty much universally shared.
uncharted,2gk32w,elpedro84,5,Tue Sep 16 14:38:45 2014 UTC,"Not completely universal, I actually liked that there were no real monsters on U3"

uncharted,2gk32w,SgtMbunz,2,Fri Sep 26 02:14:37 2014 UTC,I think naughty dog wants to have uncharted 4 realistic

uncharted,2gk32w,domainbartender,1 point,Sat Sep 27 14:24:40 2014 UTC,"That would be really cool, but I really don't think we'll be seeing dinosaurs. It's pirate themed, and pirates and dinos wouldn't mix well. A sea monster, maybe? Would love to battle the biggest octopus of all."
uncharted,2g6vec,EDoftheDEAD,7,Fri Sep 12 10:56:16 2014 UTC,It's 95% fantasy and dramatization. They basically take a real person or place and that's about it. Everything else is altered to for the narrative. They are slightly less accurate than an Indiana Jones movie. They are pulp action and they don't try to hide it.
uncharted,2g6vec,zgh5002,7,Fri Sep 12 14:01:27 2014 UTC,"While the main idea here is correct, 95% is a bit of an hyperbole. Some of the details in the locations are surprisingly accurate."
uncharted,2g6vec,tinfoil21,2,Fri Sep 12 23:53:54 2014 UTC,"Basically only the names of historical people are true and some of the locations. If you go watch Amy Hennig's interviews, she basically says she searched for historical ""gaps"" or unknowns that she could use to write a story about. So you have the fact that Marco Polo had a fleet of ships. That's true. And then everything after that is made up. These historical unknowns are basically the launchpad for the story. Everything after is complete fiction except some characters and geography."
uncharted,2g6vec,stevyjohny,1 point,Thu Sep 25 10:36:12 2014 UTC,Thats cool. Its good creativity doesn't have to be bogged down by fact all the time. Facts can be a springboard for creativity.

uncharted,2g6wev,EDoftheDEAD,4,Fri Sep 12 11:13:47 2014 UTC,We don't really know - they're likely to throw out tiny snippets every now and then. When big conventions are on we'll likely see something mentioned. Once we have a release date we'll have more of an idea of the chronology!
uncharted,2g6wev,AngelKnives,2,Fri Sep 12 11:29:47 2014 UTC,Ok thanks. Any idea what the next bunch of game conventions/expos are?

uncharted,2g6wev,morphinapg,5,Fri Sep 12 16:50:54 2014 UTC,Considering the game comes out in 2015 i highly doubt we'll have to wait till e3. Heck there's still a possibility it could come out before E3.

uncharted,2g58xe,Toasted-Dinosaur,3,Thu Sep 11 22:08:41 2014 UTC,U1 definitely didn't age well but I thought the story was probably the best out of the three. It just felt so new and fresh and I still have that respect for it.   Favorite big bad still goes to U2 though.
uncharted,2g58xe,enforcetheworld,2,Fri Sep 12 03:08:22 2014 UTC,"That part was hard, but for me, the hardest part of the trilogy was on U3, when you're fighting the ""demons"" after drinking the water.  I enjoyed U1 a lot, it's not as good as the other two, but it did set the foundation for them.   My favorite is U2, I loved almost everything about it (except the blue guys, which I forgot their name... Guardians?). What I really liked about U3 is that it was more real, no magical creatures, just hallucinations."
uncharted,2g58xe,seFausto,2,Fri Sep 12 07:46:02 2014 UTC,"Okay, I thought I just sucked at that part in U3. Glad I'm not the only one who had trouble with that, lol"

I think the first one still stands out as possibly the best entry in the series. To me uncharted will always be about Drake fighting stuff against all the odds and looking for clues. The island setting was perfect for that. It kept the character list small and the motives were simple. I like U2's global approach, but I don't think that is always necessary to go big in the locations. Isolation is perfect for adventure stories."

uncharted,2g108e,kennycharter,2,Thu Sep 11 16:09:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks. It's pretty easy, but you need a game capture device (I use elgato). Just go to cinema after you played a match, and there's pretty much everything you need, different camera modes, light, fast forward, slow motion etc. It's really cool :)...but i don't think there's a cinema for the co-op with story, for normal co-op I think there is, can't remember now."

I'm all for remakes because PS4 has no BwC. So, for those like me that have a pretty busted PC, and then just PS4, I'll take whatever I can get (as long as it isn't a ""Square Enix"" but really Eidos remake cash-grab)  Good devs only, thank you very much (:"

uncharted,2fly93,Qirex,2,Sun Sep 7 16:33:59 2014 UTC,"That was published in 2011, so it was not running on a ps4. It was probably just running on a development PC the same way e3 demos and such are run, where they beef up the specs to make it look better for marketing purposes."
uncharted,2fly93,Qirex,1 point,Sat Sep 6 22:44:45 2014 UTC,"I wasn't aware how long ago it was published, but hasn't the PS4 been in development for quite some time now?

uncharted,2fly93,stevyjohny,2,Sun Sep 7 12:09:34 2014 UTC,"While all that seems possible,  this article (http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2014/07/30/naughty-dog-ps4-didnt-have-a-working-ps4-engine-until-after-january-1-2014/) says that Naughty Dog didn't have a PS4 that could run anything until January of 2014, so they certainly couldn't have had one running a port of Uncharted 3 in 2011. Also, in the article, Naughty Dog talks about the difficulty of porting from ps3 to ps4, speaking directly about how different the architecture of the two systems are. It took naughty dog many months to put together a port of the Last of Us, obviously it's a lot of work. It seems really unlikely and a colossal waste of resources to port a game to a different, unreleased console during what was a rushed development for the console the game was actually released on.    Also, their engine was built to work on the ps3. Saying that they were testing it on the ps4 is like saying they were testing it on the xbox one.  It wouldn't work because the systems have different architecture."
uncharted,2fly93,AngelKnives,1 point,Sun Sep 7 17:02:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah that all makes perfect sense, but I guess my mind is just trying to rationalize the mere possibility that it could happen.

The best devs in the country (arguably, maybe rockstar ties with them) definitely know what to do especially with how long they've been successfully making games. I don't think that they've ever made a bad game."

It's fun, but I can only enjoy on a wrecked team all the time against a bunch of pros for so long before switching to Uncharted 3--where there are still enough people to have more evenly distributed teams in terms of skill."

uncharted,2ep7s9,BerserkRonin,5,Wed Aug 27 13:50:21 2014 UTC,"That's actually a pretty good idea. So like, Francis and his crew would be ""ally ghosts"" and then you and them are having all out war on the other pirates, then?

uncharted,2ep7s9,mrlowe98,3,Wed Aug 27 10:03:40 2014 UTC,They will maybe hit on a little mythical creature but with each Uncharted it became less and less. From naked mutant Germans to clothed mutant explorers to spiders to illusions.
uncharted,2ep7s9,morphinapg,2,Wed Aug 27 11:59:37 2014 UTC,I think the mythic city of Shangri-la is a bit more supernatural than a curse.
uncharted,2ep7s9,Irishane,2,Wed Aug 27 19:45:02 2014 UTC,"They've said they're going in a different direction with the game, focusing more on the characters. I think they may move away from the supernatural aspect."

uncharted,2ep7s9,leanaconda,1 point,Wed Aug 27 20:13:25 2014 UTC,"I also wouldn't like it. It would make things complicated if Uncharted and The Last of Us were to be set in the same universe. Questions would arise as to why Drake can't do certain things Joel and Ellie could, for example. Also, it would leave too many plot holes. I think they can bring Uncharted 4 into perfection if they just wrote a unique and separate story for it. I mean they had those 'monsters' in the other parts too, I'm sure they can come up with something that fits the story :)"

uncharted,2enfd4,MaverickXS,7,Wed Aug 27 00:27:35 2014 UTC,I recently played Uncharted Golden Abyss for the PSVita and was actually a little surprised that there was nothing like that in that game. I too like those aspects and was pleasantly surprised when the Cursed first showed up in the first game.
uncharted,2enfd4,kacboy,2,Tue Aug 26 19:01:20 2014 UTC,That's what Golden Abyss was missing and why it doesn't quite hold up with the trilogy. It was just grunts for hours and it got tiring. The creatures in the series really shake things up for the final stretches of each game.
uncharted,2enfd4,BerserkRonin,2,Wed Aug 27 18:52:15 2014 UTC,"I remember the first time I played Uncharted I had no clue, and then seeing those scary ass zombie things made the game that much cooler, IMO."
uncharted,2enfd4,BerserkRonin,3,Tue Aug 26 21:57:54 2014 UTC,"I loved them. What I remember hearing was ND wanted a more mythological game when they were making U1 but they seen the market was high for realistic shooters like CoD, Battlefield ETC. so they made U1 with realistic elements but they have the zombie people which is like what they originally wanted. This is what I've heard a long time ago so I don't remember if it is actually from ND themselves or not.  I doubt U4 won't have anything like this. All the games have received good ratings so far and I doubt they'll just switch out something that was big in all previous games."
uncharted,2enfd4,SgtMbunz,2,Tue Aug 26 19:03:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I liked UC3 but I hated that it basically boiled down to Drake drinking some funky water.   I always enjoyed that in the Uncharted-verse, having something cursed meant it was actually cursed by ancient baddies, not just an urban legend."
uncharted,2enfd4,BerserkRonin,3,Tue Aug 26 21:57:06 2014 UTC,"Same here, I liked the way it was real in U1 and U2 but I was glad that SPOILER:   I really hope U4 has something serious. It seems to be about pirates so far, so maybe some cthulu or something hahah. A giant squid that took down some ships maybe?"

uncharted,2enfd4,Toasted-Dinosaur,1 point,Wed Aug 27 01:52:48 2014 UTC,Yeah that was super lame IMO. We never get to see if the legend was true or not. It kinda seems like Naughty Dog wrote themselves into a corner.
uncharted,2enfd4,harpsama,2,Wed Aug 27 20:18:56 2014 UTC,"I actually enjoyed how they did it. The whole game was about Nate putting his lifestyle before his loved ones--oftentimes at their expense. In the well, when he dives into the water, Nate has the opportunity to peek into the center of the mystery he has been chasing his entire life. The fact that he lets it go in favor of saving Sully shows how much that adventure has caused him to finally grow up and set his priorities straight."
uncharted,2enfd4,EdgeEdgeBatistaBomb,1 point,Wed Aug 27 21:12:39 2014 UTC,"Agreed. As much as I love the character development and set pieces in U3 i have always felt the ending to that story was a bit jarring. From the moment you enter the atlantis of the sands, it was really rushed."
uncharted,2enfd4,SIRTreehugger,3,Wed Sep 10 16:07:10 2014 UTC,"They are great. I hear some people complain that the Descendants ""come out of nowhere"" and are a left-field shift in the game--but that's not true. There's a ton of consistent foreshadowing throughout from the beginning of the game. The hieroglyphics, the traps, the idols, the manipulation of the wreckage, the footprints (Nate: ""It's too quiet"") ...even glimpses of the actual creatures from afar.  I'm sure that Uncharted 4 will have one as well."

uncharted,2e6xxf,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Aug 27 17:49:25 2014 UTC,"Section 7. ""As above, so below"" of article  Hermeticism:       These words circulate throughout occult and magical circles. They are recorded in Hermetic texts, although they originated in the Vedas. [citation needed]  The actual text of that maxim, as translated by Dennis W. Hauck from The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, is: ""That which is Below corresponds to that which is Above, and that which is Above corresponds to that which is Below, to accomplish the miracle of the One Thing.""  Thus, whatever happens on any level of reality (physical, emotional, or mental) also happens on every other level.  This principle, however, is more often used in the sense of the microcosm and the macrocosm. The microcosm is oneself, and the macrocosm is the universe. The macrocosm is as the microcosm and vice versa; within each lies the other, and through understanding one (usually the microcosm) a man may understand the other.

uncharted,2dm0eu,Sir_Llama,4,Fri Aug 15 15:54:39 2014 UTC,"I loved uncharted 3's multiplayer. Perhaps there were a couple balance issues, but I sunk a shit ton of hours into it as opposed to the 3 or so I put into uncharted 2. Also, Yemen was my favorite map due to the zany vertical variability in it."
uncharted,2dm0eu,Hazdownvote,4,Fri Aug 15 06:30:50 2014 UTC,"UC3 multiplayer was ten times better than UC2 why? because it was fun bright and fast paced, people who say that UC3 online is bad are just to used to UC2 online both are completely different UC3 in a good way. After ten months play time I like uncharted three ten times better"
uncharted,2dm0eu,PcFish,3,Fri Aug 15 22:48:10 2014 UTC,I just want the pistol to be as awesome as it was in Unch 2. Barely ever used a long gun in that game
uncharted,2dm0eu,qwertyuiop357,2,Fri Aug 15 13:43:55 2014 UTC,I have way more kills with the 92FS than any other gun. My number one weapon is my fists though. Dat one punch combo
uncharted,2dm0eu,PcFish,2,Fri Aug 15 18:47:27 2014 UTC,Yessss. Sniping across the map with the pistol was so satisfying.
uncharted,2dm0eu,qwertyuiop357,2,Sat Aug 16 07:15:10 2014 UTC,More like iron fisting was satisfying.

uncharted,2dm0eu,Achillees,2,Tue Sep 2 00:04:18 2014 UTC,"I actually prefer UC3 mp. While I agree that UC2 mp was great, a lot of its appeal was due to the novelty of it. I also like the bigger maps of UC3. Tactics.  Only thing I'd change is the difference between aiming sensitivity of SP vs MP.  As for the load outs, why not both? They actually did this in UC3. I used callout to help my newbie teammates among other perks."

uncharted,2dm0eu,sandwichestime,0,Fri Aug 15 18:47:41 2014 UTC,"Just give me 60fps multiplayer.  UC3 was too janky.  Just felt clunky overall.    Oh, and instead of giving me more death animations, why not make it impossible for a player to snipe me with the sniper rifle while not facing me and jumping the other way?  I agree with most people here, bring back more of the gun skill, and less unnecessary tchotchkes that just are there to be flashy"
uncharted,2dm0eu,emeraldus,0,Mon Aug 18 14:58:23 2014 UTC,"UC3 multiplayer has a lot more to offer, I especially liked in the co-op mode where one player leaving doesn't end the game for the other two. And that you can drop into the game midway through.   Would like to see them do away with the run and gun thing in MP. Too many people think they're oh so clever in getting a kill by running in a circle firing blindly."

uncharted,2dhmzu,MarsLumograph,3,Thu Aug 14 01:05:44 2014 UTC,This is good to hear. I'd rather them make it right to the best of their ability rather than shoehorn in unnecessary gimmicks.
uncharted,2dh29k,Rocr,4,Wed Aug 13 20:54:48 2014 UTC,"It's not that bad. The final battle doesn't get that much harder; it will still take some tries with all that blue exploding stuff, but as long as you keep running you should be fine.   The fight in the train with Draza (Darza?, idk) is difficult. As well as the part with the snipers and the towers.   If you can't manage one part, even after a lot of tries and you don't mind to glitch, you can use the glitch where all tweaks (as one-shot-kills) are enable on all difficulties including those you haven't finished."

uncharted,2dh29k,kacboy,1 point,Tue Aug 19 14:15:49 2014 UTC,I know your post is old but there is a glitch that let's you use the in game tweaks (like one shot kills and infinite ammo) on difficulties you haven't beaten yet. I didn't use it but if you don't have as much time it could be beneficial.
uncharted,2dh29k,kacboy,2,Fri Aug 29 13:56:18 2014 UTC,I think they fixed that in U2. :/ I know U1 has the glitch still though.
uncharted,2dh29k,qwertyuiop357,4,Thu Aug 14 00:49:14 2014 UTC,Uncharted 3 is the only one that is really difficult in a few parts I think.
uncharted,2dh29k,PcFish,2,Thu Aug 14 06:50:09 2014 UTC,"It is not extremely difficult. Yes, there will be points where you have to redo a section multiple times. But every time offers a new approach, so there isn't much ""rage quit"" moments.   Stealth stealth stealth. If a section can be done in stealth, do it in stealth. Run away to the next section If found. Head shots. They help A LOT. Hardest part in U2 was the train chapter and the final boss. For the train mini boss save up your explosives. For the final boss... run and gun."

uncharted,2dgdeu,NathanDrake123,7,Wed Aug 13 17:20:51 2014 UTC,"I thought Among Thieves had the best story, but Drake's Fortune is a close second. The ambiance of DF is simply amazing. I remember being in the Roman Numeral room and being given  button prompt. When you press it Drake glances upward into the stone work to see a grayish, large shape dart quickly out of sight. That shit creeped me out so bad a I had to shut my PlayStation off for the night. And don't even get me started on having to move through the tunnels to turn the power on with the zombie Spaniards literally popping out of the walls."

uncharted,2dgdeu,Toasted-Dinosaur,8,Wed Aug 13 20:35:14 2014 UTC,I thought the storyline of U2 was just perfect. I really enjoyed the character development and the way each level flowed into the next.
uncharted,2dgdeu,EDoftheDEAD,2,Wed Aug 13 23:03:08 2014 UTC,Agreed. Definitely the best.
uncharted,2dgdeu,maybea2outta6,3,Wed Sep 10 16:18:47 2014 UTC,"I thought Drake's Fortune had the best build-up and reveal on the historical mystery side of things, rivaled only by Golden Abyss.  I thought Drake's Deception had the best  narrative; in terms of character development, themes, as well as knowing when to put intimate moments between the grandiose and bombastic ones (both in terms of action and drama).   I thought Among Thieves' plot was fairly simple, yet very fun and the best executed and most well-rounded entry of the franchise."
uncharted,2dgdeu,stevyjohny,1 point,Thu Aug 14 07:11:18 2014 UTC,"In some ways yes, I think it was the best. It was a very straight forward story because it really focused on a few core people: Drake, Elena and Sully. Watching the adventure unfold through a small group of character was fun and the chemistry was more vibrant. The island setting was a large contributor to this because the story was forced to focus on whoever was on the island. U2 is good, but you don't have the same dynamic with the story. Sully was absent for a large part of U2 because they were traveling the globe. I'm not syaing it's bad. It was certainly interesting and you don't want the same thing every time. However, there are certain advantages to both. But these games made me realize that the locations have a big impact on the characters themselves in terms of their development.   So in U1, the story probably takes place over a few days. Maybe a week tops. No one knows for sure. Elena and Drakes relationship develops from this trial they have on this island and trying to escape. If the writers wanted to do more with the characters, they can't make another island game because there are certain limitations with that in terms of character development."
uncharted,2dgdeu,lifeleecher,1 point,Wed Aug 20 04:09:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, but I'm going to have to agree with the bandwagon. 2's story was absolutely phenomenal and felt so natural as it switched level to level."
uncharted,2dgdeu,ScotchRobbins,1 point,Wed Aug 20 17:06:19 2014 UTC,"Depends. Regarding full-bodied narratives, the original Uncharted was the best of the three. However, if you are looking to use the story as a vehicle for setpieces and character interaction, then Uncharted 2 may be the best for that role (although 3 was also really, really good)."

uncharted,2ctyi9,AnubisUK,5,Wed Aug 6 22:50:52 2014 UTC,Uncharted 1 is very iffy with stealth kills to begin with. But the enemies in the graveyard can see you from practically every angle anyways so it's pretty much impossible to get any stealth on that section.
uncharted,2ctyi9,kacboy,2,Thu Aug 7 01:12:50 2014 UTC,"But I can get to a guy without anyone raising the alarm, but I still can't get the stealth kill :( Ah well, sounds like it's not meant to be, from what you've said. Guns blazing it is :D"
uncharted,2ctyi9,link22258,2,Thu Aug 7 01:16:06 2014 UTC,Yea the graveyard i dont think works for stealth kills. You might be better off just taking the sniper rifle and killing them all that way lol
uncharted,2ctyi9,Toasted-Dinosaur,1 point,Thu Aug 7 02:43:58 2014 UTC,"Uncharted 2 drove me mad as I was trying to kill everyone using stealth in an area where being spotted leads to a firefight which in turn triggers a cutscene required to progress.  For those interested, spoilers:  SPOILER:   I had a similar problem, but not to do with stealth, where being grabbed by the enemy leads to a cutscene, but I refused to allow myself to be grabbed for ages. Spoilers again:   SPOILER:"
uncharted,2covrs,3RDRANGER,19,Tue Aug 5 14:30:19 2014 UTC,"Good. The gameplay fits in perfectly with the adventure movie style and I'd hate for them to take away what makes Uncharted, Uncharted just for the sake of making something dark. Just because it worked very well for The Last of Us doesn't mean it fits every game.  And for anyone who's worried, the first three Uncharted games were able to convey emotional moments just fine while keeping a lighter tone."
uncharted,2covrs,the_Ex_Lurker,3,Tue Aug 5 19:24:38 2014 UTC,"well, the first game managed to come across as pretty dark, at least in my eyes. I hope the inevitable monsters are as creepy or creepier than the ones from that game."
uncharted,2covrs,7LayerDip,3,Wed Aug 6 09:29:35 2014 UTC,The first game was definitely darker but it was still pretty action movie-ish in my eyes. If Uncharted 4 is like that id be a happy.
uncharted,2covrs,the_Ex_Lurker,0,Wed Aug 6 12:25:23 2014 UTC,"That sucks, I was hoping for the darker tone they originally promised."

uncharted,2covrs,kacboy,0,Tue Aug 5 19:51:13 2014 UTC,Yeah I don't think any of the games have been as dark as the first one and I really wish they'd go back to their roots.
uncharted,2covrs,CoolOpotamus,11,Tue Aug 5 15:07:39 2014 UTC,"Based on the whole ""Thief's End"" thing, though, I still think it'll have a darker tone than the last two."

uncharted,2bjama,ginsunuva,5,Thu Jul 24 17:05:09 2014 UTC,Looking at the director and writers on IMDB makes me very worried.
uncharted,2bjama,OMGWTFBBQHAXLOL,3,Thu Jul 24 20:09:39 2014 UTC,"wow, Sony pushed back Spiderman 3 for Uncharted. Well, it's official then. This movie is really going to happen.   I like the idea of ""extra shades"" as long as it isn't abused. Honestly, I'm not optimistic. I think he's also wrong about what people want. I think a lot of people do just want a solid film version of the game and not something uniquely different. But the general public still doesn't know about Uncharted which gives them a creative license.  Personally, I feel like the movie version has an opportunity to tell certain aspects of the story that was never included in the game such as how Elena found Drake. According to the wiki, she hires a private detective to track him down. That would be interesting to see and it's within the story. The Uncharted wiki is filled with stuff like this. It would still fit within a two hourish movie time by taking out a lot of the go between segments in the game. Half of U1 is moving around in the jungles and fighting enemies. This stuff could be cut out and filled with other things, but still tell the same story.  If I was in charge.....  Intro: Elena finds drank and hires him to do her show. Pirate battle on the ship + sully rescue. Basically the same.  Middle. Drake and Sully ditch Elena (same as game, it's still good). Drake and Sully go to find the treasure and get captured. The cave part could be skipped I think and just go straight to the submarine part. Sully is ""killed"" and Drake escapes. In this version, Elena could be shown watching from a distance instead of just appearing from nowhere like in the game (Another way to tighten the screws on the story).   They escape. Action sequence.  Plane crash scene except the plane doesn't crash as far from the castle. Because Drake needs to get there on foot in a reasonable amount of time. Or I think Drake could crash the plane into the Castle after elena jumps out. Then Drake is immediately captured and Elena finds him anyways with the exact same breakout scene from the game. They could also start the movie in the jail cell and have everything be a flashback leading up to this scene which is how U2 started.  Epic escape sequence.   Might have to skip the jet ski parts because of time.  Find sully again.  Conclusion: Join forces to find El dorado and then final battle."

uncharted,2bjama,Kiwi_Force,5,Thu Jul 24 04:15:23 2014 UTC,"Fuck that, make them contractually obliged to play through all three games at least twice."
uncharted,2bjama,mrlowe98,3,Thu Jul 24 04:23:00 2014 UTC,"That's possible in like one weekend, shouldn't be a problem. Too bad Christian Bale doesn't look like Nate, he would have fully immersed himself in it. Or Gary Oldman."
uncharted,2bjama,kingmortales,1 point,Thu Jul 24 07:04:35 2014 UTC,"He did? That's messed up. It's not hard to play a video game. Seriously, what is wrong with people. I also don't understand why he is so high on everyone's list and I mean everyone. Bloggers, fans and even hollywood rumors keep bringing up Walhberg. I find it offensive. Is it because Wahlberg just has this kind of generic action appeal? Like he somehow can just fit into any action role?   He doesn't look like Drake and he is the exact age as Fillion (both are 43) who could play Drake's character and mannerisms perfectly. So if they're going to cast an old guy, they should just cast Fillion. I seriously just don't understand.   Otherwise, since very few actors look like Drake (who is not real anyway and just a video game character) they really need to just stick with acting ability even if that means going with someone less well known. However, I am pessimistic. I feel like Sony will get a big name and just use the Uncharted story line loosely in order to make a quick buck action movie. If they get Walhberg, I definitely see them going towards that direction rather than carefully considering the story."
uncharted,2bjama,stevyjohny,0,Fri Jul 25 15:04:16 2014 UTC,but that was like years ago though... plus there's only like a handful of actors that can pull off Drake's role. I think he is one of them

uncharted,2avuwv,Rathwood,1 point,Thu Jul 17 02:05:41 2014 UTC,"Eh, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. He made ""The King of Kong,"" which was great.  The Russo Brothers only did TV and comedy movies before they made ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" but after watching that, you'd think they've been directing action for years.  Not to be 100% optimistic about this; a film adaptation of ""Uncharted"" could go so easily wrong and end up looking like Indy 4."

uncharted,296ij8,MarsLumograph,6,Fri Jun 27 16:03:06 2014 UTC,"I think Nate's presence is a must for the series, but honestly for the first time I could see him being a supporting character.   There's a book called She by H. Rider Haggard--which basically started this whole ""Lost City"" adventure/exploration genre that would go on to spawn classic pulp adventure stories all the way up to Indiana Jones and Uncharted. The book's main character (Horace Holly) is an older, burlier man--who is the paternal figure and loyal friend to the naive younger explorer (Leo) who tags along on the expedition and fights beside him. Essentially it reads as if Sully was the main character of the story and watched over Nate as he came into his own age.   I think Sully prequels could work if it followed this sort of outlook, where it's with teenage Nathan Drake as the tagalong partner--and the game could be split t 70/30 like The Last of Us between the older, main character (Joel), and the younger escort one (Ellie)."

Then it was time to develop for PS2 and they decided to build a new world with a new set of characters and it was even better (J&D), with PS3 they evolved again and took character and level design to a new level with the Uncharted games.  As much as I love these games, I know the team can do more (see The Last of Us).  I want to see what this team does when they aren't restricted to the concepts they set up early in the PS3 era.    That said, I don't mind if they farm out some Vita spin-off games or something like that.  Or if they return to uncharted after a break when they have a good story to tell."

uncharted,28y819,ColonelBrutus,2,Tue Jun 24 14:50:40 2014 UTC,"The voice definitely doesn't match but I think it would be really awesome if the guy in the trailer actually was Dante. I mean, what the narrator says in trailer fits Dante pretty well. First of all he says he was left ""buried alive"". Well, at the end of Golden Abyss it's possible that Dante survives the cave-in triggered by Guerro's explosives, leaving him entombed with all the dead Quivarians; ie. ""buried alive"". Moreover, Nate obviously never goes back for him: ""You left me... rotting in that hellhole."" And seeing as the timeline is being manipulated a little little bit (Nate has aged quite significantly since we last saw him in U3 despite there only being a mere 3 year gap in real-time), it's entirely plausible that the events of Golden Abyss take place 15 years prior to the events of Thief's End to match the narrator's claims.   Personally, I expect that the villain will be an entirely new character, but it's fun to speculate like this!"
uncharted,28y819,ColonelBrutus,2,Tue Jun 24 09:34:50 2014 UTC,"Yes the words add up with Dante, but the accent is completely lost. It could be that they are doing more facial capture and needed a different Voice Actor though."

uncharted,28p1vv,morphinapg,4,Sat Jun 21 02:59:13 2014 UTC,"Lower fps makes things look more dramatic and larger than life, and motion blur just makes sure the lower fps doesn't look too choppy. The reason lower fps has that effect is because it activates your imagination more. The motion blur actually makes things look larger and more impressive in motion as well (as things literally stretch across the screen more to appear larger), which contributes to it.   If you ever watch a movie where miniatures are used, or where objects are made to appear larger than they actually are, the film is recorded in slow motion. The reason for this is because of the effect gravity has on larger objects. An object 100 ft in the air will take 10x as long to reach the ground as an object 1 ft off the ground, so slow motion simulates that.  While slow frame rates and slow motion are two different things, they have similar effects on how we perceive things. If you want a game to have a good dramatic cinematic feel to it, then 30fps is probably the better artistic choice. In this case, frame rate is used as an artistic decision, rather than a technical one. If you're just in it for the gameplay, that sort of thing probably doesn't matter to you. Just keep in mind that technical improvements are not always the best artistic choice. For the same reason many photographers choose to shoot in black and white instead of color, even though color is technically superior, some people may prefer the look of 30fps over 60fps in some games as well. That separation from realty creates a more dramatic feel. It makes things feel like it's not exactly real, but sort of better than real.  The biggest reason to use 60fps is a gameplay one. However, Uncharted is a game that is fairly slow paced and uses realistic animations. This means it can take a full second sometimes to blend between one animation and the next. 60fps gives you up to 16ms of faster response time. If an animation is taking 1000ms to  blend, and you improve response time by 16ms, it isn't going to have any noticeable effect to gameplay. 60fps is fantastic for faster paced games, multiplayer games, and games that are more arcade-y and use very responsive controls and animations. Things like FPS, especially the twitchy FPS games, racing games, fighting games, 2D platformers, and pretty much any online portion of a game since those tend to move quickly even with games that have a slower paced single player like Uncharted or TLOU.  When 60fps doesn't affect gameplay, like it wouldn't with Uncharted, then it's simply a visual effect, and an artistic decision can be made for whether to include it or not. I say it's probably a better idea to allocate resources towards getting the best graphics you can at 30fps, instead of trying to push for 60fps, which sacrifices graphics somewhat. Even when a game looks great at 60fps, it always has the potential for better graphics at 30fps, and I think it's worth it for games that won't really receive any gameplay benefit of 60fps.   And many people like myself simply like the look of 30fps, because it does increase the dramatic effect. It feels more cinematic and more immersive. Just look at The Hobbit. Some people thought the 48fps presentation was a neat effect, but a lot more people thought it took something away from the film. It does. Increasing the frame rate has the opposite effect as decreasing it. It makes things feel less dramatic, feel smaller and less impressive. It's a neat effect visually, but not necessarily the most appropriate artistic choice. Some people will try to claim that video games and movies are different, and they are, but the only difference would be in how the frame rate affects gameplay, and as I've already said, in games like these, with a slower pace and smooth animation systems, it doesn't affect gameplay. It's just a visual effect, just like in the movie, and so it's perfectly fair to use that comparison."
uncharted,28p1vv,morphinapg,1 point,Sat Jun 21 07:30:07 2014 UTC,"The thing is--from what I've heard--frame rates in video games work differently than frame rates captured on film/video. Film automatically brings in the motion blur that smooths the transition from one frame to the next and creates that trademark cinematic visual effect--but this motion blur (for some reason or another) is lost when automatically rendering video game gameplay. You have to insert that motion blur effect intentionally--like Naughty Dog did with the Uncharted Trilogy and The Last Of Us.   Like I said, I don't know if you remember Uncharted 3 at launch--where it was still 30 fps but had no motion blur, and its visual quality obviously suffered from it. It took about a month for Naughty Dog to patch in the motion blur and that is when a lot of fans thought that the game finally gained the telltale cinematic imagery it should've had the whole time (like its predecessors did).   I do agree that 60fps is necessary in faster paced games and multiplayer experiences that require highly responsive controls. I find that, in addition to making things more responsive, higher frame rates clear the picture to have an increased depth of field (which both single and multi-player sides of Uncharted could benefit from with their grand environments and skyboxes).    Now I agree with you that the motion blur does increase dramatic effect, but it also works well with the visual pacing that film making techniques because they were always designed around 24fps. Higher frame rates cause the frequent cuts, camera movement, and editing to appear faster--as if someone was holding down the fast-forward button--because the shots aren't allowed to linger and soak in as long as they were with the somewhat slower and smoother imagery.    I think what I am asking for is a compromise in-between. I do like the clarity that 60fps provides, however I don't like the jarring effect it can have on dramatic, narrative-heavy, and cinematic-inspired experiences. I do like the motion blur that a lower fps on film provides, but would not want the responsiveness to suffer simply for artistic direction. What I want is for Naughty Dog to incorporate (or at least give us the option to) the motion blur effect that they have been using for their last 4 games to give them that cinematic-visual callback and use it with the 60fps that gives better clarity and responsiveness for an ultimately prettier image that plays better.   I do think that 60fps with motion blur would be the perfect way to preserve both the visuals and the gameplay and it looks well. It is a subtle effect but I think a vital one for a game that strives for a cinematic experience. If you want some examples:  Click on the ""60 frames per second with and without motion blur""  (Funnily enough, this only links to a PC Master Race thread. Just click the link and THEN the ""60 frames per second with and without motion blur.)   I know Youtube compresses everything to 30fps, but heres an idea of a 60+ fps game, Call of Duty, with and without the motion blur effect"
uncharted,28p1vv,morphinapg,2,Sat Jun 21 08:30:07 2014 UTC,"The thing is--from what I've heard--frame rates in video games work differently than frame rates captured on film/video.   That's simply not true. Motion is motion. Especially when you have motion blur involved. Most games recently realistically reflect the way motion blur in real life works. Movies don't even always do that. Movies tend to have half of the motion blur as real life, making the motion a bit more stuttery. Mostly because it results in better looking screenshots, but it does make the motion a bit worse as a result.   Here's a video I filmed at 24fps with full motion blur. Notice how much more smooth that video plays than most movies filmed at 24fps. This is the result of a shutter that is open for the full duration of the frame rather than for only half the duration, which is what they typically use for movies.  Some movies even purposefully film at a faster shutter to nearly eliminate motion blur. It makes a very crisp image, but VERY stuttery motion. If the frame rate was 60fps, this wouldn't be as big of a problem, but at 24fps you really need motion blur for it to feel smooth. Same thing with 30fps in games. If you don't have motion blur, it can look pretty bad.   Film automatically brings in the motion blur that smooths the transition from one frame to the next and creates that trademark cinematic visual effect--but this motion blur (for some reason or another) is lost when automatically rendering video game gameplay. You have to insert that motion blur effect intentionally--like Naughty Dog did with the Uncharted Trilogy and The Last Of Us.   Right, and when done properly, the motion blur in video games is just as good, if not better, than that in movies. You can actually render motion blur natively in CGI. It basically requires rendering at a much higher frame rate and blending the frames back down. Although vector blur post process effects are cheaper and tend to look just as good. Most games in the last few years use pretty realistic motion blur, including the Uncharted games and The Last of Us.  Again, the only thing that separates motion in movies from motion in games is gameplay. If the frame rate affect gameplay, like it does in certain games, then the movie comparison doesn't really work, but when it doesn't, like in the case of Uncharted, then the movie comparison is completely fair.   Like I said, I don't know if you remember Uncharted 3 at launch--where it was still 30 fps but had no motion blur, and its visual quality obviously suffered from it. It took about a month for Naughty Dog to patch in the motion blur and that is when a lot of fans thought that the game finally gained the telltale cinematic imagery it should've had the whole time (like its predecessors did).   I didn't get UC3 at launch. I got it at christmas, so I didn't experience that, but judging by the way you described it, I wouldn't doubt it. But that's just because motion blur is a big part of what's necessary to maintain smooth motion at low frame rates. Heck I'd recommend it at any frame rate, but a big part of the cinematic experience is also the lower frame rates, as I explained. Motion blur is part of it, but not the whole thing.   I find that, in addition to making things more responsive, higher frame rates clear the picture to have an increased depth of field (which both single and multi-player sides of Uncharted could benefit from with their grand environments and skyboxes).   Motion blur would be smaller in 60fps, and sometimes not enabled, so it does result in a clearer picture when in motion.   FYI: depth of field refers to a different effect, where one object is in focus and everything else is somewhat out of focus, or blurred.   Now I agree with you that the motion blur does increase dramatic effect, but it also works well with the visual pacing that film making techniques because they were always designed around 24fps. Higher frame rates cause the frequent cuts, camera movement, and editing to appear faster--as if someone was holding down the fast-forward button--because the shots aren't allowed to linger and soak in as long as they were with the somewhat slower and smoother imagery.   It does feel like that. I was playing Tomb Raider and I got a little motion sick at moments. I think it's because higher frame rates allow for more precision in camera movements, which is why they're so important in FPS games. However, because there's higher precision, it's more natural to move the camera quicker, and this quicker movement can cause motion sickness in excess. Whereas with slower frame rates, you tend to move the cameras in slower, more cinematic ways. While the improved precision does sound like a gameplay benefit in the gun play, I believe Uncharted's camera aiming during gunplay is driven by the character animation, which I explained is purposefully laggy. While it's less laggy during gunplay, I still don't think it would make a big difference here, and accuracy of gunplay was never a big issue in Uncharted single player.   What I want is for Naughty Dog to incorporate (or at least give us the option to) the motion blur effect that they have been using for their last 4 games to give them that cinematic-visual callback and use it with the 60fps that gives better clarity and responsiveness for an ultimately prettier image that plays better.   They would almost certainly include it, but the effect would be very minimal in comparison to its 30fps version, because motion blur is representing the motion that happened between frames. When more motion is being represented by the frames themselves, less of it needs to be represented by the motion blur, resulting in a smaller, less noticeable effect. 60fps with motion blur is almost indistinguishable from reality, and personally, I don't like dramatic experiences to feel real. I want them to take me out of reality. To immerse me in their world instead of my own.   I know Youtube compresses everything to 30fps, but heres an idea of a 60+ fps game, Call of Duty, with and without the motion blur effect   That's not in game motion blur. It's an effect added in their video editor, which probably worked with a 30fps video file, meaning it's representing a 30fps motion blur effect, not 60fps."
uncharted,28p1vv,qwertyuiop357,1 point,Sat Jun 21 09:21:14 2014 UTC,"Okay, you've convinced me back. I had been told at another point that it was the motion blur effect alone, nothing to do with fps (at least in video games), that gives Uncharted and The Last of Us that trademark cinematic look. But you have elaborated on your points very well and I see that you're correct. Thanks for clearing it up for me.    I just want to be able to have the option to play Uncharted 4's campaign with the normal cinematic look--which I now know is both a lower framerate AND motion blur. I know Naughty Dog announced they're aiming at 60fps with the new game and I am afraid that I will lose my ability to immerse as well like I did with Tomb Raider. I am aware that when a developer announces they're going to do 30fps to preserve that cinematic look people boo and hiss (like the reaction to The Order 1886 developers announcing that, which I personally was relieved to hear), so at least just give me the 30fps/motion blur option in the Tweaks or Display Settings.   Would it be taxing on the game or difficult at all for Naughty Dog to include the lower fps/motion blur option for the game?"
uncharted,28ldgz,ToastedButterBuns,4,Thu Jun 19 22:48:43 2014 UTC,So I wonder if they will kill off Drake?
uncharted,28ldgz,YonkeyKong,3,Fri Jun 20 01:03:40 2014 UTC,Probably Sully.
uncharted,28ldgz,Bruce_Wang,5,Fri Jun 20 04:52:39 2014 UTC,"NO! I'd rather Drake died than Sullyâ¦ Would rather he did something heroic, possibly to save Sully and sacrifice himself and go out a hero.  I'd take this with a pinch of salt, as I reckon when that trailer was released this was possibly quite a different game (after all the hullabaloo with people coming and going). We'll see though."

Jensen Ackles (from Supernatural) comes to mind. I just don't know if he could hold up for a major movie.   Bradley Cooper could probably do it. He's showed his comedic as well as serious side. Just not sure if he could do action.  If all else fails, it might be a better idea to use an actor who isn't known. I think action movies do better that way."

uncharted,288dmg,maybea2outta6,1 point,Mon Jun 16 01:36:22 2014 UTC,"For video games there's not much that really does fall under the classic, pulp-adventure genre beyond Uncharted. Some of the classic Tomb Raiders have it, though not executed as well. I wasn't a big fan of the reboot, however. Still, you do have the option of playing licensed games from franchises (even if they're not the pinnacle of gaming) from Indiana Jones and Tintin and such.   If you want more Uncharted you have a few options. I know you don't have a PSVita, but soon the PSTV will be launching for about a $99 and Uncharted Golden Abyss is playable on that (highly recommended). There's the 3-episode animated comic, Uncharted: Eye of Indra, you can purchase from the PSN (or stream for free on Youtube if you don't want to support Naughty Dog) that was written by Hennig and voiced by the classic actors. There is also a graphic novel, Uncharted, that is its own adventure--the art is serviceable and the story is fairly fun. There is also a novel, Uncharted: The Fourth Labyrinth, which is next on my reading list but I've heard good things about.   Here are some suggestions I have if you want to explore the genre of pulp-adventure further in other franchises and different mediums:    Indiana Jones: movies (obviously), games, books, comics, television, etc.  She by H. Rider Haggard (book that started the genre) The Mummy Trilogy (film) Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (film) Romancing the Stone (film), The Jewel of the Nile (sequel film) Tintin: Movie, show, comics Sahara (film) as well as its book series by Clive Cussler that follows Dirk Pitt."

He's had dealings with shady characters in the past with Flynn as the obvious example - and the story that he had broken into the museum in Istanbul before and was the only one to make it out suggests his friends don't always share his luck... There were none too subtle nods in U3 that he isn't really called Drake so I'd imagine that this will play into the story this time around - who he really is and what the true nature of his connections to the Drake family really are. Also he got the ring during the flashback to Cartagena, so that's been fleshed out already.

In the museum didn't Flynn screw him over though? He still made it out so he is lucky, I like the idea if the game going near the first one. I hope it's not the actual end to the series, maybe Nate stopped the bad guy who called Nate a thief but the bad guy can be delusional right?  Remember in U2, was the guys name Lazaorvich or something? He went pretty crazy. I hope they make it that the enemy in U4 thinks Nate is a liar etc but turns out he went batshit crazy when he was in a hellhole for 15 years.   I'd hate for the series too end. U2 is one of my all time favorite games, and the series are just amazing. If they stopped the series I'd be disappointed, the trailer for U4 gave me goosebumps lol. I'm a huge fan. So ya. And I wouldn't like to find out he's not related to Drake at all. If it is someone who was related to him coming back because he was supposed to find the coffin with Nate, I'd hope they are cousins or something. I've read somewhere that in U3 Marlowe said something about Nate not being who he really is, but I'll replay it soon to find out. And I would hate for Sully to die (and Nate, but saying I don't want the series to end already includes that). I wonder what the monsters of U4 will be. In U1 we had the vampire things, U2 was snow beasts, U3 the ghost riders lol."
uncharted,284lds,Lo-Tsen7,1 point,Sat Jun 14 19:52:01 2014 UTC,The reason Flynn recruits Nate for the museum job is because he'd already broken into it once before - he barely made it out and the others he was with didn't make it (it's not clear if they were arrested or killed). This is why his reaction to the proposal was no - until the link with the lost fleet of Marco Polo made it irresistible... And the scene where Marlowe lets on she knows Nate's 'real' name is in Yemen just before the parkour chase with Talbot...

uncharted,27w7w9,FTWisFTW,15,Wed Jun 11 18:03:29 2014 UTC,am i the only one who feels like they're slowly pushing drake to look more like nathan fillion so he can play drake in some upcoming secret movie?
uncharted,27w7w9,OrangeLightning4,6,Wed Jun 11 20:10:30 2014 UTC,The movie isn't secret. It's been announced for awhile now.
uncharted,27w7w9,msnc13,5,Wed Jun 11 21:48:49 2014 UTC,"As much as I love Nathan Fillion, he's gotten a bit pudgy. It's noticeable in Castle, and the role of Drake would obviously be very physically demanding.  I always thought Zachary Levi from Chuck fame would be a decent match for Nate."
uncharted,27w7w9,genchris,2,Wed Jun 11 22:11:34 2014 UTC,Possibly. He does have a lot of experience from Arrow.

uncharted,27w7w9,Zugam,1 point,Thu Jun 12 10:28:40 2014 UTC,True but it's a testament to Naughty Dog that they didn't rest on their laurels
uncharted,27w7w9,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Thu Jun 12 16:59:19 2014 UTC,I have to disagree there. It was amazing for the time but it's really started to look outdated in the last year or two. Uncharted 2 is holding up really well but certain multiplayer textures are starting to look a bit bad.
uncharted,27w7w9,LFCMick,1 point,Thu Jun 12 22:58:18 2014 UTC,"I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one. Having recently played U1 it still looks amazing, the only part of it that's showing it's age is the character model for Drake, but overall and IMO it's still a fantastic looking game.  Uncharted 2 is eye candy!!, never played the multiplayer but I've seen some screencaps of textures of it, any reason why there's such a disparity between the singleplayer and multiplayer??"
uncharted,27w7w9,the_Ex_Lurker,0,Fri Jul 11 01:08:47 2014 UTC,Maybe I'm just spoiled by The Last of Us.
uncharted,27w7w9,LFCMick,2,Fri Jul 11 14:50:56 2014 UTC,"Haven't played The Last of Us, are the graphics really that good??"
uncharted,27w7w9,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Fri Jul 11 15:40:09 2014 UTC,Aside from a few frame rate problems (they seem to be more common than in U3) the graphics truly look great. Although it seems like there was a more profound difference going back to older games after playing TLoU rather than the other way around.
uncharted,27w7w9,Michaelscot8,1 point,Fri Jul 11 18:16:53 2014 UTC,"As you look into the eyes of Nathan Drake in his newest depiction, You see in his eyes an expression of fear, Experience, loss, but most of all, Acceptance. This is possibly the most depressing thing i've seen in a while, it honestly brought a tear to my eye. The once youthful and somewhat naive Nathan Drake, has matured into an heir of experience, intellect, but also depravity. He has lost so much of what he cared for, and so much of his youthful self, that it can be seen purely through his facial expression. However, what most predominantly amazes me, is how the developers of this fantastic game, can express that with polygons and textures. In the end, I feel it is something more. Something much, much more.  TL;DR Nathan Drake has grown."
uncharted,27w7w9,LFCMick,0,Fri Jul 11 19:53:42 2014 UTC,He looks a bit like Liam Neeson.

uncharted,27vgxx,turian_vanguard,2,Wed Jun 11 14:20:50 2014 UTC,He pulls the slide back two times... I don't understand.

uncharted,27vgxx,leanaconda,-1,Wed Jun 11 19:43:29 2014 UTC,I actually cant stand when cut scenes are at 60fps. Looks great for gameplay but I feel like it looses the cinematic touch.
uncharted,27vgxx,teck101,1 point,Wed Jun 11 18:23:59 2014 UTC,"I disagree with you but you shouldn't be downvoted. It's a well known effect, film is shot at 24fps and we've seen so many movies filmed at 24fps that anything else gets the ""soap opera"" effect. Those types of shows are often shot at a higher fps and so are (or were) home videos so they looked ""worse"" than film, because it's not what you're used to, even though they're technically better. It's also why people either loved or hated The Hobbit at 48fps.   Right now the devs for The Order are taking a lot of heat for coming out saying that they went for 30fps to be cinematic. Now, it's certainly possible that this was a decision that came later after they figured out they couldn't get the graphics they wanted at 60fps, and in either case they were able to push the graphics more by settling for 30fps, however it's also entirely possible they started from the beginning wanting 30fps for how it feels. And they are correct about that, 30fps feels a lot more like film than 60fps. 24fps is plain stupid for video games but 30 is playable, they've said this too, but it's at least more cinematic than 60.  Now personally, I would love to see more 48fps (and 60fps) films and I prefer my games to run at 60fps (or 120 but my monitor doesn't support it), I really appreciate the smoothness of motion and the much smaller input lag.  But I also think it's bullshit that people like you get downvoted for being heavily affected by the soap opera effect and wanting lower fps cutscenes or even gameplay. It's an opinion. It's something communities can discuss in a civil manner."

It's just like someone choosing to film black and white. It's an artistic choice. Maybe I need to see this video 60fps but with the dramatic lighting put back in. That may have been what was throwing me off. Regardless I have been an uncharted fan since day 1 and will be a day 1 buy for me."

I really hope they don't think they have to make a game with the same amount of weight that The Last of Us did--it just doesn't fit. We already got the ""depressing and gritty"" pulp adventure through the Tomb Raider reboot and I wasn't too big of a fan of that."

I'm really glad Ubisoft gave us Ezio's death, albeit not in a game. I think we've seen a lot of series take new directions in the transition period of the new consoles, and this could be one. I don't want the end of uncharted, but maybe a successor to Drake for future games. Either way, I have faith in Naughty Dog"

uncharted,27r67r,stevyjohny,4,Tue Jun 10 05:56:29 2014 UTC,"Elena has always been a main character. There is no reason why should we would not be in there. If she wasn't it would be the first time. I thought that after u2 she would be a lock to appear in future games, but fans still have this anxiety she will be absent"
uncharted,27r67r,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Jun 12 13:33:19 2014 UTC,"She's been in less each game, probably due to Haven, and seeing as Haven is filming 2 seasons this year, it seems like common sense to worry."
uncharted,27r67r,kacboy,2,Thu Jun 12 14:08:01 2014 UTC,It's due to more characters who need screen time.
uncharted,27r67r,morphinapg,2,Mon Jun 16 19:28:32 2014 UTC,"I love Chloe and Cutter, and I hope they return in some form, but Elena is more important to the overall story. She shouldn't have had a decrease in screen time each game. I'm pretty sure it had to do with never having enough time to do a lot of the game because the schedules didn't match up well with her Haven filming (which i believe started after she was done with Uncharted 1). Looks like she will probably be free during the winter and again next summer probably, so if they don't release the game until holiday 2015 they might have plenty of time to film with her. If it's coming in summer 2015, she might not be in it much."
uncharted,27r67r,xWilQ,33,Mon Jun 16 19:33:50 2014 UTC,I was so afraid that they would not show anything... But the Thank God! :D
uncharted,27r67r,seansye,6,Tue Jun 10 02:52:27 2014 UTC,save the best for last.
uncharted,27r67r,Marlito214,15,Tue Jun 10 03:10:14 2014 UTC,How long has he been out of the game!? Does this mean he could possibly have a family with Elena now!?
uncharted,27r67r,TheJamie,29,Tue Jun 10 02:59:03 2014 UTC,The wedding ring on his hand supports that theory.
uncharted,27r67r,BoneyarDwell89,16,Tue Jun 10 03:01:31 2014 UTC,He also looks a bit older to me.
uncharted,27r67r,nignigproductions,4,Tue Jun 10 03:04:53 2014 UTC,"Or its just the necklace from the end of UC3. Maybe Elena's been kidnapped, hence the last mission, and when he gets her back its the end of his thieving life. Prob not though. Edit: Scrolling down to the 'About' part of game page supports my Elena theory, sort of."
uncharted,27r67r,cayal3,6,Tue Jun 10 04:52:57 2014 UTC,It sounded like it was his idea (Sully saying how crazy it was) and he said it was a sure thing. Doesn't sound like Elena's in trouble.
uncharted,27r67r,kacboy,4,Tue Jun 10 06:23:36 2014 UTC,Therefore it is still his wedding ring. Also I doubt ND would just use Elena as a damsel in distress.
uncharted,27r67r,Rocr,11,Tue Jun 10 17:29:57 2014 UTC,"I found this on the website of the game  Several years after his last adventure, retired fortune hunter, Nathan Drake, is forced back into the world of thieves. With the stakes much more personal, Drake embarks on a globe-trotting journey in pursuit of a historical conspiracy behind a fabled pirate treasure. His greatest adventure will test his physical limits, his resolve, and ultimately what heâs willing to sacrifice to save the ones he loves.  So sounds like you're right."
uncharted,27r67r,10GuyIsDrunk,1 point,Tue Jun 10 05:57:24 2014 UTC,"Can't explain how hyped I am right now, I made this comment half a year ago."
uncharted,27r67r,qwertyuiop357,3,Tue Jun 10 21:54:07 2014 UTC,"Well, each game was spaced apart in their in-game timeline by the same amount of real world time, so maybe four years from U3?"
uncharted,27r67r,spoilersweetie,2,Tue Jun 10 03:19:17 2014 UTC,"He's looking in his 40s, U3 he was what, 34 years old?  so I would think perhaps even ten years. He's got some wrinkles under the eyes and I thought I saw a grey hair or two (might be the lighting)"
uncharted,27r67r,maybea2outta6,2,Tue Jun 10 05:44:53 2014 UTC,"He had more wrinkles and a few grey hairs in Uncharted 3 to show he was getting older. I think betting on real-world time is a safe-bet, so I'd say he's going to be 38."
uncharted,27r67r,stevyjohny,1 point,Wed Jun 11 12:39:38 2014 UTC,It looks like they did a Dark Knight Rises and made the sequel span more time than in real life. 8 years passed in DKR from the DK while it was 4 years in real life. I think there could be an 8 or 10 year gap from U3 to U4.
uncharted,27r67r,qwertyuiop357,1 point,Wed Jun 11 12:21:02 2014 UTC,"Maybe that is the case, but that hasn't been the trend for the last three games."
uncharted,27r67r,stevyjohny,1 point,Wed Jun 11 21:30:13 2014 UTC,"True, but he does look a lot older this time which suggests a bigger jump in time. But that's just my thoughts. I could be wrong. Although it is interesting why they would make a huge time jump. I wonder why they would want to do that? The title leads to the possibility that its actually Nathan Drakes time to hang it up and so they made him older. If that is the case, it would be interesting to find out what he has been doing since U3."
uncharted,27r67r,Asator_,15,Thu Jun 12 13:12:51 2014 UTC,A Theif's End... hmm.. anyone else thinking Nate might die?
uncharted,27r67r,JQbd,6,Tue Jun 10 03:04:46 2014 UTC,"I'm so excited to play when it's released, but I also don't just because I don't want to find out if he does or not"
uncharted,27r67r,spoilersweetie,8,Tue Jun 10 03:16:17 2014 UTC,"You'll find out eventually, so might as well enjoy the story before it's spoiled."
uncharted,27r67r,white_water,4,Tue Jun 10 05:14:48 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking it may have a double or triple meaning, so perhaps."
uncharted,27r67r,Bethorz,1 point,Tue Jun 10 05:43:43 2014 UTC,"Nah, Uncharted is not that bleak."
uncharted,27r67r,white_water,2,Tue Jun 10 13:40:32 2014 UTC,"Uncharted under Hennig wasn't that bleak, I wouldn't be especially surprised if Druckmann killed Nate, though, especially since they're really selling the ""this is the last game"" vibe."
uncharted,27r67r,karatemanchan37,8,Tue Jun 10 14:10:52 2014 UTC,"I still don't think they would ever kill Drake. Uncharted is serious when it needs to be, but overall it's more about the fun, Indiana Jones like feel. They won't kill Drake or Elena, that's way too depressing."
uncharted,27r67r,Sneaks_McGeeks,1 point,Tue Jun 10 14:16:26 2014 UTC,"Maybe this is the ""Temple of Doom"" in the series."
uncharted,27r67r,rewindthegamer,0,Wed Jun 11 01:53:45 2014 UTC,"So darker, but sillier? The trailer gives a darker vibe from the beginning, but killing of Nate would just be plain stupid, from a marketing point of view, or from my point of view... please don't kille of Nate, Naughty Dog, please"
uncharted,27r67r,morphinapg,14,Wed Jun 11 17:10:05 2014 UTC,Here's the trailer in 60fps. Beautiful...
uncharted,27r67r,killjoy95,-4,Tue Jun 10 04:05:07 2014 UTC,"eeehhhh.... Uncharted in 60fps looks wrong to me. It's a pretty effect, but artistically? idk, feels wrong. Feels less cinematic. Although it does seem like they're going for more realism here, but they do clearly still have a lot of styled art seen in the environment."
uncharted,27r67r,mrlowe98,12,Tue Jun 10 05:58:25 2014 UTC,"I'm calling it that Sully will be the one to die instead of Drake. After all they BOTH are thieves, and it seems unlikely that they'd kill the protagonist off unless they were to continue the franchise with a new one."
uncharted,27r67r,LittleDansonMan,10,Tue Jun 10 04:08:17 2014 UTC,"After Sully's ""death"" in UC3, I doubt they'll pull the same move twice. I don't think he'll even come close to death this game."
uncharted,27r67r,mrlowe98,4,Thu Jun 12 00:59:50 2014 UTC,"They already did. He ""died"" in Uncharted 1, too."
uncharted,27r67r,Sneaks_McGeeks,3,Fri Jun 20 18:14:50 2014 UTC,"True, but it wasn't nearly as emotional. If they try to pull on the heartstrings again like that in UC4, it'll be much more similar to his death in UC3."
uncharted,27r67r,stevyjohny,5,Fri Jun 20 20:50:06 2014 UTC,Sully's death would hit me emotionally. Nate's death would just dissapoint me
uncharted,27r67r,karatemanchan37,2,Tue Jun 10 17:24:12 2014 UTC,I thought Sully would die in U3 and I was actually kind of upset he didn't die during that scene that ended up just being one of those 'it was all just a dream' sequences. I like sully. I just felt like it would have given that game more drama which I thought it lacked a little bit.
uncharted,27r67r,Cardboard_Waffle,21,Wed Jun 11 13:35:30 2014 UTC,"So Drake got stranded in the cold, in the desert...now the rainforest? Doesn't the setting look like Drake's Fortune?!"
uncharted,27r67r,stevyjohny,14,Tue Jun 10 02:57:04 2014 UTC,I actually thought they might pan over to the plane stuck in the trees from the first game.
uncharted,27r67r,TheJamie,2,Tue Jun 10 03:55:56 2014 UTC,"For a second, I thought it was the same island from U1. I thought he was going back. I got excited until I realized there would be no reason to go back there, although it would be cool."
uncharted,27r67r,Mattoosie,8,Sun Jun 15 13:38:10 2014 UTC,Can anyone see what's written on the outside of the cage right before the end?
uncharted,27r67r,rewindthegamer,10,Tue Jun 10 03:00:14 2014 UTC,"""For we require the due reward of our deeds"""
uncharted,27r67r,qwertyuiop357,5,Tue Jun 10 03:19:18 2014 UTC,"Idk the first word, but what follows is ""...we receive the due reward of our deeds."""
uncharted,27r67r,MaleCra,8,Tue Jun 10 03:07:56 2014 UTC,Fuck me hard or fuck me gently. It doesn't matter. I'm pretty excited.
uncharted,27r67r,8bubbles8joe,7,Tue Jun 10 03:19:43 2014 UTC,"As much as I didn't want to blow my money away, I think this is the title that has sold me on getting a PS4. I don't think I've ever been so fucking hyped for a title before.  Hell yes, Sully and Drake back to kick some assâ¦one last time."
uncharted,27r67r,MetroidAndZeldaFan,4,Tue Jun 10 03:42:21 2014 UTC,One last time.
uncharted,27r67r,afgballa24,4,Tue Jun 10 02:50:34 2014 UTC,I really hope this isn't the last Uncharted game. :( But whatever Naughty Dog makes is a masterpiece so I'm hyped either way! :)
uncharted,27r67r,Ilstig,5,Tue Jun 10 03:48:36 2014 UTC,Those look like the same cages from Drake's fortune. End it where it all began?
uncharted,27r67r,WhiteRevan,8,Tue Jun 10 03:16:58 2014 UTC,"IIRC the story of Drake's Fortune involved his ancestor Francis Drake, and UC4 is rumored to feature him prominently as a playable character in his own time (he may be the narrator for the teaser from last December). So it's quite possible he's returning to UC1's setting due to Francis."

uncharted,27r67r,LostInThisWorldx,3,Tue Jun 10 02:58:55 2014 UTC,"At the end of the trailer, the words 'for we receive the due reward of our deeds' is engraved on the pirates cage in the foreground. I looked it up and it seems to be a verse from the bible. ""And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss."" Could be nothing and only pertain to that individual pirate, but I think Naughty Dog put it in for a reason."

uncharted,27r67r,Sicklylol,1 point,Wed Jun 11 01:41:01 2014 UTC,the way drake addresses Sully shows that this probably doesn't have anything to do with Ellena or anyone else being kidnapped sounds more like another wild chase of glory and wealth
uncharted,27r67r,ITzzz_Ian,1 point,Sat Jun 14 18:15:53 2014 UTC,This game's going to be so fucking amazing; I am 100 % positive that it'll be at least as good as the other ones.
uncharted,27r67r,stevyjohny,1 point,Sat Jul 26 01:40:13 2014 UTC,"WHAT IF, and HEAR ME OUT, what if...the subtitle isn't about Nathan, but about the pirates from the past who's treasures they're chasing?  Now, I just watched a whole bunch of videos speculating Uncharted 4's potential story options. And it seems that they're going in the direction of Henry Every's adventures in piracy. What I'm thinking is that they're going to come across journals or logs, and that they'll develop flashbacks (maybe playable just like Young Drake in U3) out of the texts. I'm fully hyped, I just don't think Nathan will die. I feel like they want us to think that, though.   And I know Nolan North has said he feels it could be Nathan Drake's last adventure but that doesn't mean he's doomed to die (I think North's reaction to that question was pretty sincere in that he wasn't hiding anything, but after all he is an ACTOR). And it doesn't mean Uncharted is over.    After all, there's a lot more to be told about Sully. ('dat prequel opportunity 'doe)"
uncharted,27tyvl,SouthWestAvenger,1 point,Tue Jun 10 23:43:48 2014 UTC,"For me the big perk of multiplayer in the third game is in the co-op missions. If someone leaves or gets booted in UC2's co-op missions it ends the game for everyone. Not so in UC3, as long as two people are still playing the mission continues and a third player can drop in mid mission. I'm hoping UC4 will expand on the co-op mission offerings, I always found them more interesting than just running around killing other players."
uncharted,27tyvl,emeraldus,1 point,Wed Jun 11 01:08:22 2014 UTC,I love uncharted three's fast paced action compared to the slow boring uncharted two. You need to know how to get used to the absolute craziness of uncharted three and when you do it is amazing (even though it took me about five months to get used to it)
uncharted,27t8hd,R_DOSS,2,Tue Jun 10 19:25:00 2014 UTC,"I have been doing some more digging and I found something that looks almost perfect to the pistol featured in the trailer the Stoeger Cougar 9mm. http://www.kygunco.com/prodimages/19374-DEFAULT-L.jpg It has the same frame, safety on the right side, the breach on the right side, and correct rear profile. Until we have more information on what pistol was used this is as close as we are going to get for the time being."

uncharted,27t8hd,Hazdownvote,1 point,Wed Jun 11 21:30:13 2014 UTC,I have been wondering that as well. Now to me it looks like a colt defender but that is just a first glance guess. Will keep looking.
uncharted,27t8hd,Hazdownvote,1 point,Tue Jun 10 20:28:10 2014 UTC,Well when he first picks it up it looks square on the bottom and side but then it looks like it's rounded on the side and flat on top so I'm not sure anymore
uncharted,27t8hd,leanaconda,1 point,Tue Jun 10 20:44:06 2014 UTC,Looks like a Beretta 92FS-9mm from uncharted two

I was either expecting this or a vengence induced God of War trailer. I hope this isn't the last Uncharted though. I think this series could continue under a different character easily. I guess we will have to see though how this turns out.

uncharted,27r6pl,jake10house,2,Tue Jun 10 05:22:23 2014 UTC,"The title seems a bit like them creating buzz at the possibility of Drake dying, but more likely relates to the story.  I can see them spinning it as a thief/historical figure from the past that left a legacy/treasure that nobody could solve/obtain and you're on a quest to do so."
uncharted,27r6pl,TheGoldenMonkey,1 point,Tue Jun 10 19:18:42 2014 UTC,"Honestly I'm fairly sure I know what it means. It has nothing to do with Drake.  I believe this entire game will be about a pirate who stole treasure and disappeared. Turns out he went to North America where he then lived out the rest of his life after hiding the treasure. He is directly involved with the Illuminati/Freemasons/Skull & Bones. For whatever reason Nate needs to find the treasure and the current incarnation of whatever secret society the pirate was involved with is also looking for it, maybe they kidnap Elena to force Drake to find it.  My source is myself. There's a very good chance I'm way off base, but I think I'm on the right track.  Anyways, The Thief's End is about the pirate having died after hiding the treasure. To find the treasure you start at the pirates death and work backwards, in this case (I believe) a masonic gravestone. So it's not about Drake, though he might die at the end anyways to be all poetic."

uncharted,2750ue,maybea2outta6,13,Mon Jun 2 20:03:35 2014 UTC,"Pretty interesting. Druckmann and Straley's involvement on Uncharted 2 really provided the focus the project needed to be the best executed entry in the series. I really hope they do not completely revamp the script and story that Hennig started (and I'm a little concerned about this because of the ditching of a main actor/character so far into production).   While it may not have told its story as flawlessly as Among Thieves, I thought Uncharted 3's narrative was by far the best one in the series from nearly every aspect. Hennig really knew how to write the world and characters, and in Drake's Deception she gave some very [fun] archetype characters into more complicated people while also delivering the best and most cerebral villains in the franchise.   Here's hoping that Neil and Bruce can provide their signature narrative focus to Amy's story and vision to make U4 the best Uncharted yet."
uncharted,2750ue,BlackNyellow,6,Mon Jun 2 20:12:06 2014 UTC,"You liked Marlowe & Talbot? I thought they were both pretty boring, Flynn and LazareviÄ blow them out of the water in my opinion. Also I didn't like how Talbot had random superpowers, the disappearing after drugging Cutter and taking the bullet and being totally fine."
uncharted,2750ue,JadedDarkness,5,Tue Jun 3 03:51:14 2014 UTC,"I thought that Marlowe was a much better villain than Lazarevic from a writing standpoint. She knew how to rip Nate to shreds from inside his head. She was less cartoony and more psychologically effective and became a villain that the audience despised as well. Sort of like a Nurse Ratched or Dolores Umbridge.   Lazarevic was a fun villain and McTavish gave an extremely entertaining performance out of it--but the character was pretty flat and didn't really raise any psychological or moral stakes for Nate. His no-bullshit, kill-my-own-henchmen attitude made sure that he came off as a mean motherfucker, but he ultimately went nowhere as a character or ethical challenge for Nate. They almost had something interesting when he suggested they were both the same monsters with a bloody trail, but that was dropped immediately and glanced over.   I thought Flynn was a great villain and I would definitely place him over Talbot. He oozed personality and shit-eating charm and was dynamic and fleshed out enough to sometimes even root for him at the same time when I wanted to punch him in the jaw. Still, I thought Talbot played as a nice foil for Nate--definitely the anti-Drake--and was interesting to see what Nathan would be like with resources and a darker motive. Those two moments in Syria are more of an attribute of the poor scripting rather than poor character-writing and should have been expanded upon, but even then there's enough conveyed about the organization to have that fit in their logic. His cool demeanor and deadly capability easily make him the Boba Fett of the franchise for me."
uncharted,2750ue,the_Ex_Lurker,2,Tue Jun 3 07:15:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I hated that Marlowe and Talbot's mysterious ways were never really explained or revealed"
uncharted,2750ue,morphinapg,8,Tue Jun 3 05:18:28 2014 UTC,"While it is a flaw that they were never explained in the game, if it helps you Amy Hennig did tweet out to expand upon it:   ""Hey - I saw people are also confused about Talbot getting shot, and disappearing... maybe I can elaborate a little...  Marlowe's crew is supposed to be a highly-trained clandestine organization, with roots stretching back to Elizabeth I and earlier.  Sort of like CIA/MI6 secret intelligence service type ops... so the idea is they have lots of means to confound their enemies like a secret arm of the CIA or MI6 might, for example. Like Cutter says, manipulating their enemies through espionage, deception, fear.    This is based on real-life clandestine ops, and ""the art of deception"". Groups like the CIA really used magician's tricks as well as drugs, etc. to trick and frighten their enemies. So - you can assume there's a rational explanation behind these mysteries... e.g., a bulletproof vest, an escape rope/wire, whatever--which looks ""magical"" but has a rational explanation, just like a magician's trick.  Magic, tricks, deception, illusion, perception vs. reality - these are themes throughout the game. Abra-goddamn-cadabra.""  While I agree with her that the game's story and presentation conveyed enough about the organization and the general themes in the narrative for the audience to link most of these together (so this critique never hit as hard for me, plus this gave me a little more closure on the matter); I do know that as a screenwriter she should have shown this visually. Ambiguity can be good--as with the revelations poised by Marlowe or the reasons for Nate/Elena strain between 1&2 and 2&3--but forcing the audience to make assumptions about something that potentially breaks the world-logic is a no-no."
uncharted,2750ue,Bethorz,1 point,Tue Jun 3 14:35:42 2014 UTC,"Lazarevic was the most generic villain you could possibly think up.   Rich? Check. Psychopath? Check. Ex-Army/War Criminal? Check. Deformity/Scars? Check. And don't forget the token foreign accent. Hell, he was even bald."
uncharted,2750ue,morphinapg,9,Thu Jun 5 23:30:33 2014 UTC,"I don't think Emily Rose (Elena) is going to have any time off from filming her show until probably early next year since they're filming two seasons back to back this year of Haven. Although I suppose they might have a short hiatus around October as the first season is finished.   Maybe she already got her lines recorded during her break this year (she was free up until May for the most part this year I believe) but if they're changing things significantly, she may have new scenes she needs to film, and if that's the case, the game's not coming out this fall. I wouldn't expect that anyway with as little information as we have at this point anyway, but I think Spring/Summer 2015 at the earliest seems like a safe bet.   Unless of course Elena isn't going to be in it, but they better not do that after Uncharted 3. She's been in less and less each game and I don't like that. She was a big part of what made the first game so great and she needs to be a major part of the next game as well."

uncharted,271ual,anti_taco,14,Mon Jun 2 02:02:24 2014 UTC,"I agree that storyline wise, 3 wasn't so hot. But in terms of graphics and gameplay, it was absolutely amazing. The boat graveyard and cruise ship parts are some of my favorite moments from any video game. Also the online is really fun."
uncharted,271ual,Sir_Llama,3,Mon Jun 2 06:12:55 2014 UTC,"Those parts were very cool, my problem with 3 was the huge swings in difficulty.  I played on Normal and found most of the game fairly easy, but certain scenes would come out of nowhere and be stupidly difficulty, such as on the cruise ship entering the main lobby (with the piano in the middle).  Or the scene with the truck mounted turrets near the end.    I found the first game had scenes that frustrated me, and the third game had scenes that frustrated me.  The second game seem so much more balanced.  Other than that I loved all 3 games.  The story for 3 was good enough and the graphics and the locations were breathtaking.  The gameplay in 3 was a small improvement over the 2nd game.    With Neil Druckmann taking 4 over after all of the departures, I have extremely high hopes for it."

uncharted,24zdxv,meganev,3,Thu May 8 16:01:09 2014 UTC,They didn't look too far off from the cutscenes in-game to begin with. It was mostly a difference in lighting.

uncharted,24edg1,DapperDuelist,2,Wed Apr 30 20:48:26 2014 UTC,I think what makes the Last of Us better in terms of melee is the shiv. Despite being right behind people in uncharted I often don't go for the neck snaps because it usually ends up with me punching them once and then alerting them to my position because the stealth kill didn't work. With the shiv button being different than the punch button I know when I'm able to get that one shot stealth kill.

uncharted,24ath0,Hazdownvote,7,Tue Apr 29 21:19:58 2014 UTC,"Honestly, we won't see much. ND is clearly undergoing some issues at the moment since several major names have left the studio including Amy Hennig, the creative director who basically made Uncharted what it is. Plus, the villain has been recast, meaning there is probably a lot of performance capture to redo. Now don't get me wrong, I love Naughty Dog and I have full faith that they'll make another amazing game, but whatever happening is definitely concerning, and is probably delaying the game BIG TIME."

uncharted,247xd9,mattapo2,2,Mon Apr 28 21:50:44 2014 UTC,The time spent in the city was indeed short. Woefully short. Especially when you consider the fact that he was hallucinating it for most of the time. At least with Uncharted 2 you were in the mountains for a good chunk of the game and in the first game you were on the island for a good portion of it.
uncharted,247xd9,uhleckseee,7,Tue Apr 29 16:15:37 2014 UTC,"I think it just got overshadowed by Among Thieves. It's hard to follow a near-perfect game, and with that expectation going into it, a lot of the game was lack-luster. Also, it kind of broke from the idea of the paranormal in the game. We got some of it with Talbot, but the explanation was rough. I don't know exactly what changed from 2 to 3, but it felt like it lost its charm a bit.  Not taking away from the game quality though. It's still a great game, it's just lesser-so when compared to 2. Playing as child-Drake was such an amazing experience in itself and almost makes up for the rest."
uncharted,247xd9,Alsharad,5,Mon Apr 28 22:05:05 2014 UTC,"playing as child drake was fun the first time, but is a major pain in the asa and kills the replay value for me.  I've gone through U2 4 times, finally got through U3 a second time but had to start after the parts of kid drake."
uncharted,247xd9,Alsharad,6,Tue Apr 29 02:47:40 2014 UTC,I think it's the best uncharted game

uncharted,247xd9,qwertyuiop357,7,Sat May 3 04:32:57 2014 UTC,"To me it was just so damn uneven. You have all these grand events that are so spectacular on there own, but they just don't flow together. And by the end I really had just lost that emotionally charged excitement I had in Among Thieves. Not to mention the whole reasoning behind the ending with all the demons. Just underwhelming."
uncharted,247xd9,Melyanna,9,Mon Apr 28 21:20:37 2014 UTC,"That I can understand. The ""guardian"" type enemies were somewhat disappointing compared to the previous games, both in how you beat them and what they really are.

uncharted,247xd9,Salute_The_Bud,4,Mon Apr 28 21:39:21 2014 UTC,"I think it's just the explanation for them. In Uncharted 1 and 2 there were guardians that had a backstory (sort of) for why they were there. For Uncharted 3, they were regular people with Drake evidently hallucinating the fire and such...if I understand it correctly."
uncharted,247xd9,SutureTheFuture,6,Mon Apr 28 21:42:07 2014 UTC,"That is true, but that's part of why I liked them more."
uncharted,247xd9,zgrove,1 point,Mon Apr 28 21:44:52 2014 UTC,"Fair enough.   Also, I was evidently wrong...They were complete hallucinations, not just the ""effects"", so my bad.

We know literally nothing about it, and because of that it really looks like anyone that had a connection with Hennig's original vision of the game is suddenly leaving the company.  I don't doubt it'll be good, because Naughty Dog doesn't really do any thing less then great. But I am personally losing most my interest in it. I love the previous games, and I love TLoU. But all these huge personnel changes on UC4 kind of suggest a complete overhaul of the game and I like the Uncharted series as it is.

uncharted,23mden,heathengray,1 point,Tue Apr 22 18:35:59 2014 UTC,"On it's own? Not much, it's a competent 3rd person shooter with brilliant set pieces, and terrific multiplayer.  Next to Uncharted 1 and 2? The story is too short (6 hours), with almost no original narrative, or any new fleshed out characters. It's too reliant on the spectacle of the set pieces to push the story forward which is almost a faded copy of Uncharted 1. None of the character grow and learn from the experience:   Drake is told he will be sorry if he loses Sully, and despite all the crazy shit, there are no consequences. Drake learns it's OK to always rely on his friends, even if he's the one that put them in that situation. Elena learns that despite falling in love with Drake, there was something about him she didn't like (hence the separation). And despite all of the crazy shit, she gets back together with him, because he's totally changed, honest. Sully will follow Drake around like a dog, until he dies. Because that's what he's always done.   Going back to Drake and Sully's origin's was a stroke of genius, that just rang hollow before the end because nothing happens. The whole game made me like Drake less - and I had bit of a man-crush on him in 1 and 2. He was Indiana Jones for the 21st century, and this game made him out to be no better than some of the ""bad"" guys he kills - only he's poorer and less equipped, so I guess that's meant to make it all right.  It's the Temple of Doom of the series - a lot of bang for your buck, but forgettable and wouldn't be able to carry itself were it not for its two better sibling games.  I ranted, sorry."

Heck, you could even have an Uncharted game with Indiana Jones or Lara Croft as the main character, and it would still fit  in the series imo.   It was just strange that the trailer debuted with some unknown guy doing to voice work instead of Nolan North. There had to be an important reason they chose someone else to do the voice for the trailer, and because it's a new generation, and the game wasn't called ""Uncharted 4"" but just ""Uncharted"" this lead a lot of people to consider the possibility that they'll be starting a new Uncharted series with a new cast."

uncharted,22i2eq,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Apr 9 03:24:43 2014 UTC,"I happen to agree, but so far I'm still worried that ND could be going in a different direction. Especially since they have refused to comment on whether Nathan Drake is coming back or not."
uncharted,22i2eq,uhleckseee,1 point,Wed Apr 9 03:27:10 2014 UTC,"Ok, so they didn't say that, but it doesn't mean that he isn't coming back... They've only just put out a trailer."
uncharted,22i2eq,uhleckseee,1 point,Wed Apr 9 03:28:48 2014 UTC,"Right, but when the trailer features the voice of a new actor, not Nolan North or anybody we know from the series, the game is coming to a new generation, isn't called ""Uncharted 4"" but just ""Uncharted"" and ND doesn't tell us whether Drake is back...  All those things together certainly create a lot of uncertainty about whether Drake will be back, or whether they're basically rebooting the series for a new generation with new characters."

It introduces the characters, and you start to get to know them. If you really don't want to though here is a link to a summary of the story."

People have been asking this ever since 2 came out and then 3. In those days, the games were running near full price still except for U1. Maybe U2 was around 35 dollars when U3 came out. Either way that was like maybe 90 dollars if you wanted to just buy U2 and U3. But now they are significantly less expensive."

uncharted,21m9sz,Pkwlsn,1 point,Fri Mar 28 20:15:44 2014 UTC,I would absolutely love playing the PS3 Uncharted games in 1080P. I would for sure buy a copy.
uncharted,21m9sz,morphinapg,0,Sat Mar 29 05:30:31 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. I had to create a new PSN user due to being stuck with a sub account, so if I'm going to replay the games to get those trophies again, might as well be on PS4! Plus the Uncharted series is easily my favorite game series, so obviously I'd want them in as high of quality as possible.  If they do these, it's because they ported the PS3 engine to PS4 for Uncharted 4, meaning ports of their PS3 games are actually very easy. Plus, they said they keep higher resolution assets than what are used in the game, so they could increase the textures and poly without trouble. Basically, gameplay would look as good as the cutscenes or possibly even better, for example, because shadows would almost certainly look better on PS4 than in the cutscenes.  Golden Abyss is unlikely because it didn't use the same engine, so it would have to be ported on its own, which would take a much longer time than the others."
uncharted,21m9sz,Squander,1 point,Sat Mar 29 03:33:06 2014 UTC,They said in an interview a long time ago that U4 will be done using the same engine as LOU. (maybe this changed?)  They felt it took them too long to move from ps2 to ps3 and the reason was they built a new engine when the really didn't need to.
uncharted,21m9sz,morphinapg,1 point,Sun Mar 30 19:53:47 2014 UTC,"Yes, UC4 uses the same engine as all their PS3 games. Obviously with new features just as every new game gets.   I was saying Golden Abyss didn't use the same engine. It was done by a different team for the PS Vita, and it had its own engine."
uncharted,21m9sz,GameChng,0,Sun Mar 30 20:00:37 2014 UTC,"It would give naughty dog more chances to master the engine vefore taking a gamble with a new endeavor, so that's fine."
uncharted,21llbb,Onehates9GAG,1 point,Fri Mar 28 15:45:34 2014 UTC,Uncharted 3 multiplayer is free to play now and can be downloaded from the store at no cost. I think this means that the network pass is probably free or not necessary anymore - or maybe you're just going to have to download the multiplayer again (for free of course).
uncharted,21llbb,SlimAssassin2343,2,Fri Mar 28 16:14:59 2014 UTC,"I think the free version has limits, however. Such as a much lower level cap and lack of certain game modes. Could be wrong though."
uncharted,21llbb,TheSkittle,1 point,Fri Mar 28 16:21:00 2014 UTC,I thought they removed that at the two year anniversary update; all map packs can e downloaded for free now and IIRC the cap is also removed.

uncharted,21jnlx,stevyjohny,3,Fri Mar 28 04:31:20 2014 UTC,"I think this could be a good sign or a bad sign.  Maybe Uncharted 4 is a trainwreck.  Or, on the positive side, it's making lots of needed changes.  Let's be honest.  Uncharted 3 was an amazing game, but it also showed that if it doesn't break out of the predicable structure, then it will become stale.  I think the writer and the director fell in love with their work too much to change it."
uncharted,21jnlx,evilclownmonkey,1 point,Fri Mar 28 19:36:08 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't know who Richmond was and I didn't know that Hennig left either. I was most surprised by that. That could either be really good or really bad as she was the brain child of the stories and overall ""mood"" of the games. I am no expert critic, but I think her writing was getting stale in my opinion. Uncharted had really become shallow with the third game. I wasn't satisfied with the lack of information presented in the game. They somehow managed to release huge details about Drakes past without really sharing that much.   They showed the meeting of Drake and Sully, but nothing else was revealed except that Drake was an orphan it seemed. But we never got any narrative about this from Drake himself. Overall, I just don't care for the ""implied"" story telling methods in this franchise. This was evident again when fans had to piece together what exactly happened between Drake and Elena after the second game which ended on a high note. Hennig decided to trash that and go for some kind of divorce/separation scenario; however, it was never stated explicitly in the game. Again, we were left to our devices to debate this.   Not to mention, there were problems with the overall plot and misuse of popular characters such as Chloe who literally disappeared halfway through the game never to be seen again, not even at the end. This franchise just needs some new life. No more chasing artifacts vs rogue enemies with private militias. It needs to get away from the feel good nostalgic adventure genre. Of course, that is what everyone has loved about the games, but at a certain point there needs to be some risk taking with the characters and some development. I think they tried to do a little bit of that in the last one with Elena questioning why Drake had to have adventure and chase legends. But it just seemed hollow because nothing resulted from it. No one dies. They just kept on adventuring. And Elena ends up helping him again as if those scenes never happened."
uncharted,21ki9l,kitty52bad,1 point,Fri Mar 28 04:31:09 2014 UTC,If Uncharted 3 is rereleased on ps4 I'll buy it 100% of it includes 3D!
uncharted,21d07s,zgrove,12,Tue Mar 25 22:11:04 2014 UTC,"1) Agree.  2) Do you mean the cruise ship or the shipyard?  Personally I felt that the shipyard was the best part of the game.  The rest of it is so painfully on rails, the freedom in the shipyard section was such a fantastic change.  3)  I disagree.  That would lose the cinematic value, item management and upgrades would really ruin the immersion.  And I loved the chapter select, and adding item management would complicate that.  4)  Not more puzzles.  Better puzzles.  There are enough puzzles.  5)  As long as they flesh them out, which they really failed to do in 3.   6)  That would be interesting to see, maybe add replayability.    I would love to see more open sections that are not as hand holding as uncharted 3.  Uncharted 2 hit the balance between control and cinematic value quite well."
uncharted,21d07s,zgrove,2,Tue Mar 25 23:47:48 2014 UTC,"2 - Well, not all of the ship sequence was bad, but it had too much weight relative to the whole story.  the entire set of chapters was like 2 out of 10 hours.  3 - What's wrong with a choice?  Upgrade during a playthrough or don't upgrade during selected chapters.  Versus... never upgrade at all.   agree on the rest."
uncharted,21d07s,bilge6,6,Wed Mar 26 01:21:28 2014 UTC,"2)  The game was about 6 hours for me, and I would rather have as much of the game be fun gameplay as possible.    3)  Much of Uncharted's strength is it's movie like qualities.  Stopping to view an upgrade menu or gather and manage items, and have an exp system for the upgrades, would be much to arcadey, taking the player out of the cinematic experience."
uncharted,21d07s,turdlop,1 point,Wed Mar 26 01:29:52 2014 UTC,I don't agree with you on the item management. It worked very well in The Last of Us
uncharted,21d07s,bilge6,5,Wed Mar 26 01:53:40 2014 UTC,"Yes but the last of us shot for a different feel.  It was important to make the player feel the scarcity of the environment, like you were barely surviving.  It also slowed down the gameplay and forced the player to think more strategically.  Those things are not really Uncharted's goals"
uncharted,21d07s,Achillees,1 point,Wed Mar 26 02:21:24 2014 UTC,"I think at least skills would translate well, I do agree that weapons would be tedious. Maybe some melee weapons though?"
uncharted,21d07s,heathengray,4,Wed Mar 26 03:05:28 2014 UTC,"I have Two issues with Uncharted 3.   There were 2 aiming systems, one default in sp, the other mandatory in mp. How about we have one next time to avoid confusion.  Make the multiplayer more original. It really is not special, just cod with platforming and a third person POV. It is good, but it isn't the system selling multiplayer they wanted U3 to be."
uncharted,21d07s,heathengray,3,Wed Mar 26 00:41:21 2014 UTC,"uncharted 3's multiplayer was quite good but i agree, it doesn't feel original enough.  i would suggest making it more platformer oriented.  right now it's like 70% shooting, 30% platforming.  let's make it 50-50."
uncharted,21d07s,OrangeLightning4,2,Wed Mar 26 01:22:43 2014 UTC,"Adding more verticality to the multiplayer would definitely help.  The best map in my opinion was sanctuary, and it had a great amount of platforming and shooting, from both close and long range."
uncharted,21d07s,secretmamoth,2,Wed Mar 26 01:31:40 2014 UTC,"Oh man. Sanctuary was the bomb. I also loved Village, but that might have been partly because it was so beautiful."
uncharted,21d07s,Danny878,2,Wed Mar 26 02:53:07 2014 UTC,"verticality helps, but anything to keep people moving.  stage hazards would be interesting if done right."

uncharted,21d07s,Mizzou_Madman,1 point,Wed Mar 26 01:29:47 2014 UTC,I second the aiming.  I never went back to SP because it would ruin my hard-earned skill in MP.

He has more money than xp which is totally different than what the information glitch does (AFAIK); than one only shows the wrong amount of kills on the leaderboard and not on their 'personal page'.   I (sadly) don't know the glitch, but some time ago, some guys made fun of Naughty Dog by putting an account named something like NDIsIncompetent in the top 10 of the leaderboards. After that one was banned NDIsIncompetent2 appeared on the top very quickly and some players started discussing the existence of this glitch on the forums.   Since ND doesn't ban players anymore (I think), I wouldn't mind knowing this glitch haha (will save me 6.000.000 xp to get max level)"

uncharted,218sck,Rocr,3,Mon Mar 24 19:57:33 2014 UTC,"Not trying to be an asshole, but I think you might be a bit to late with doing a Lets Play of the three Uncharted games. Last game came out more than 2 years ago already, so I don't think a lot of people will be interested. The games are very linear so there are not a lot of surprising things to show. The Uncharted veterans have played the game a dozen times already and others have moved on.   But, with Uncharted 4 coming, you might make some kind of summary/highlight reel (is that how you call it?) of the first three games (thrown in the Vita one as well if you have a Vita) to ""prepare""/make people exited about part 4. (And if you have a PS4, make a Let's play of U4!) That is definitely something I would watch!  I think the time investment might be really high for a (pretty) low amount of viewers... On the other hand, since havent played the games yourself, you could play/lets play it at the same time. (though, why/how would it be different than a lot of existing walktroughs?) And if you really want to get into a lets play, why not. Dont let me stop you :P"

When you say chapter, is it like tomb raider where you progress through an area and then end up in a new section/chapter, or is it more old school like Mario where you actually finish a level then go to a cutscene or menu then start a new section? I'm just trying to figure how immersive it is."
uncharted,20ojtg,That5YearOld,4,Tue Mar 18 01:49:45 2014 UTC,"Cutscenes then next level. It's not open world, just large open spaces with lots of cover (also you can climb things). There's no armour, and you use the guns your enemies drop so no upgrades."
uncharted,20ojtg,That5YearOld,1 point,Tue Mar 18 02:18:45 2014 UTC,How large? And are the levels very linear or is there room to explore somewhat? Ultimately I guess I just want to make sure it's not just run from point A to point B and kill everyone on your way there type of game.
uncharted,20ojtg,That5YearOld,2,Tue Mar 18 02:36:23 2014 UTC,"I played them at least a year ago so I can't remember that much but there's not that much exploration.

I'd say its worth a shot, more linear than tomb raider, but in general, the uncharted games are a lot better than tomb raider IMO"

uncharted,1zlogg,SiriuslyLupin,7,Wed Mar 5 05:15:17 2014 UTC,"The only thing that bums me out more than this news is the general reaction to it (elsewhere): ""lol Uncharted 3 was terrible, no big loss. Uncharted 2 was only good because Druckmann.""   Never mind that Hennig wrote all three games (and U3 was my personal favorite, but that's only my opinion). She of course wasn't single handedly responsible for the games, since NDs apparently all about collaboration, but I would consider the Uncharted series her baby, as much as TLoU (which I also love) was Druckmann's.  Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily believe the ""forced-out"" rumours, and even if they're true we don't know the actual circumstances. And, while I have no doubt the game is in very good hands, Hennig was a HUGE part of what made Uncharted what it is, and losing her takes a big bite out of my excitement for the new game.  On a tangently-related note, I find it really weird that Druckmann/Straley would suddenly want to be in charge of Uncharted, they seemed awfully excited about working on a new project after Left Behind wrapped. It's strange, I wonder if we'll ever find out what happened?"

uncharted,1zlogg,getgc,5,Wed Mar 5 05:17:35 2014 UTC,"Sad she left, she did great work with the first Uncharted.  Sadly, after what she and Druckmann did for U2, U3 definitely suffered in both plot and content.  I think she did what a writer should never do - she fell in love with her characters, and so didn't want anything bad to happen to them. She had her chance to prove her writing chops in 3, but decided to just pull the same cheap plot trick she used in the first game.  It was clear Naughty Dog's B team was working on Uncharted 3 even beyond the plot (what was it, 6-7 hours long of albeit impressive set pieces), and the A team on The Last of Us (15 hours of tear-jerking narrative, and gut wrenching combat)  If that means a meatier Uncharted 4, I'm all for it."

uncharted,1zlogg,Tech-Mechanic,3,Wed Mar 5 23:30:30 2014 UTC,"I've been a gamer for over 35 years. The Uncharted series, particularly Uncharted 2, are my favorite games of all time. Sure they're great action shooters but, what made them so special to me was the characters, their interaction with one another, the witty dialog, and the sweeping adventures taking place across such fantastic set pieces, in some truly imaginative locations.  Just like as with movies, no one person is responsible for the success or failure of a huge project like a modern video game. But, also as with movies, the person at the creative helm of the project usually has the biggest influence over the outcome. I feel like a lot, if not most, of the elements that add up to make Uncharted so great had to come from Amy.  So, if the rumors are true, that she was indeed forced out of the company over some petty little bullshit, this is a huge disappointment for me. Not only because it puts the future of my favorite gaming franchise in jeopardy, but also because I love most everything that this studio has ever done... It's always a bummer when you learn that people you look up to and respect as someone who's at the top of their field, can be affected by the same petty interpersonal squabbles as the rest of the plebes.  The Last of Us was also something special but, that game and Uncharted aren't even trying to scratch the same itch. Even though those guys definitely know how to make a great survival horror game, that's no indication that they can do as well with a light-hearted yet adrenaline charged adventure game."
uncharted,1zlogg,afgballa24,-3,Thu Mar 6 22:30:52 2014 UTC,"That really sucks, but as for uncharted ps4 that means that the directors of the last of us will take over. Does this mean we will get something fresh and a bit different with the new uncharted and a bit of a different storyline?"
uncharted,1zlogg,DEVILneverCRIES,7,Wed Mar 5 06:37:51 2014 UTC,I'm sure this will have little impact on the upcoming Uncharted title.  The story is probably well on its way to being completed if it's not already.

It's crazy how much different Uncharted 1 to TLoU looks, I watched a video about all of these trucks they used on TLoU to get the most out of the ps3s hardware, and I can't wait to see what they can do on the new tech."

uncharted,1zhrsv,heathengray,3,Tue Mar 4 08:07:22 2014 UTC,"Despite how rushed the pacing was for the gameplay portions of the Ubar chapters, the final scene following (on the Airstrip) was both fantastic and very necessary. The good performances and delivery aside; for the plot Sully needed to get Nate to verbally give up the adventuring life and commit to something more meaningful (like a life with Elena).   I think they could have handled the execution of Sully's faux-death a bit more so that it was more convincing--but his living in the end was most important."
uncharted,1zhrsv,Gamer9131,1 point,Tue Mar 4 20:24:47 2014 UTC,I can see that. I wonder what they'll do for 4?
uncharted,1zhrsv,kaztrator,4,Tue Mar 4 20:25:54 2014 UTC,"I'm cautiously optimistic.   While it wasn't the most poignant piece of fiction ever, I actually thought Uncharted 3 had a ton more depth than just about any pulp-adventure story before. Its plot may not have been as flawless as 2, but I think it had a lot more substance in its themes and messages. The big ones being the analysis of the adventure protagonist is really just a little kid refusing to quit playing hero, even when it hurts those he loves. At the end of the game we have Nate give up his life of bullets and treasure for one idle and safe with loved ones.   Where do you go from there, then? Uncharted 3 was already a meta-analysis of both the series and genre by framing itself so similarly to Uncharted 2 to then de-romanticize it. How do you return to the run-of-the-mill grand adventure after that?   If this is a sequel set after 3, Nate's going to have to be reluctantly dragged back into the adventuring life or 3's plot (and the franchise along with it) will feel disingenuous. It's certainly a possibility, because the trailer voiceover talks about revenge, so it appears that the antagonist will call Drake back into action.   But, Naughty Dog has yet to let me down since the first Uncharted, and I'll keep and open, optimistic mind for the 4th.   P.S. Sorry for the wall of text. Also, I advise you do what I plan to do for Uncharted 4 news by correcting what I did for Uncharted 3's: limit your news consumption. I was so eager for 3 that I watched and read every trailer, article, preview, making-of video, etc., that by the time it launched it felt like I had experienced a lot of it (though it was my favorite still)."

Plus, I'm happy more people get to play Uncharted: Golden Abyss. It's not just a good Uncharted game, it's a plain good game on its own--and a fun story of Nate's to experience."

uncharted,1z93uk,bubson4,4,Sat Mar 1 08:58:10 2014 UTC,"I have nothing to do and since I'm a big Uncharted fan, I might aswell participate in this thread.  SINGLEPLAYER   Nathan Drake, Elena and Sully. The story is in the present, like all the other games. An interesting and scary nemesis, like a mix between Lazarevic and Talbot. Story set in one or two places, no traveling around like crazy. (Uncharted 3, I'm looking at you.) A torture scene where Drake can't escape. No hollywood superhero moves this time, just plain torture and no hope. Maybe this way Drake will have flashbacks that can teach us some things about his past and we see a Drake we've never seen before. Sully's death. Now, hear me out. Uncharted 4 will probably be the last Uncharted game. Sully is one of my favourite characters, right up there with Nathan Drake. I think his death would contribute to the story and make it more dramatic.  Maybe a 'flash forward' showing Drake teaching his son/daughter about Sully? Going back in history (like Assassin's Creed) and playing a pirate or any other character from that timeline will be losing an excellent  opportunity and will probably be a bad move. I am 200% confident in Naughty Dog though, they have never disappointed me.     MULTIPLAYER   More weapons. Uncharted 3 did it right with the weapon classes but we need more weapon variety and customization.  Forget the weapon variants like 'Drake's Pistol' or 'Sully's Sniper'. More atmospheric maps like The Village and The Temple. REMOVE POWERPLAYS. Get rid of shit like MegaBomb. Boosters need to be fully remade. Treasure sets are a good idea, keep it. Remember the tank in The Village? Make more events like that.  More character/emblem customization"

I usually play most games on hard, but I just wanted to get through the story on those. Even on normal, some of the enemies, like the helmet guys, felt like bullet sponges. Maybe it's because I just finished The Last of Us, but it felt kind of grindy at points. Does this game have those moments? Because if it does I think I might go easy."
uncharted,1z51kx,BiddlyBongBong,2,Fri Feb 28 01:35:29 2014 UTC,"I'd go for normal again, it's pretty much the same as 1 and 2 difficulty wise. You'll get a good sense challenge but still be able to cruise through the story at a good pace."
uncharted,1z51kx,ColonelBrutus,5,Fri Feb 28 01:41:18 2014 UTC,"I'd say Normal. It's not overly difficult most of the time but it's also not so easy that game-play becomes uninteresting because you're just breezing through it.   As for your side question, according to the wiki, Golden Abyss takes place in 2005, 2 years before Drake's Fortune in 2007."
uncharted,1z51kx,ColonelBrutus,2,Fri Feb 28 02:32:13 2014 UTC,"Oh wow, I thought it would've either been between 2 and 3 or after 3 (if that's possible) Looks like I've got another whole game to play before I jump into 3"
uncharted,1z51kx,ColonelBrutus,4,Fri Feb 28 02:42:20 2014 UTC,"Cherish these moments. I wish I still had another whole Uncharted game (or 2!) to play. Seriously though Naughty Dog, hurry up with Uncharted 4 already.   I was pleasantly surprised with Golden Abyss. At first I wasn't too keen on the idea because the handheld game in a franchise doesn't usually hold-up in comparison to the console games (especially when it's made by a different developer) but that couldn't be less true for Golden Abyss, in my opinion. The dialogue and story feel almost exactly like the Naughty Dog games and the game-play translates pretty awesomely onto the Vita. Have fun!"
uncharted,1z51kx,virtual-toast,3,Fri Feb 28 03:26:04 2014 UTC,"There's gonna be an uncharted 4!!! Thank God, I thought the series was done for some reason. It's like a really good book, you just want to et through it to know what happens, but you also don't want it to end. I just started 3, and I decided I'll play golden abyss after that. I'm definitely enjoying it so far, I love that they showed how Sully and Nate met."

I was worried for a bit Naughty Dog wasn't gonna continue the Uncharted series in order to start an new franchise for the new console generation, like they've done in the past. But now that Naughty Dog has two development teams we get the best of both worlds - new Uncharted AND awesome original stuff like The Last of Us!    I'm definitely enjoying it so far, I love that they showed how Sully and Nate met.   Yeah, that's one of my favourite parts of the whole game!

(Uncharted 2 hasn't aged at all despite coming out almost 5 years ago). That being said, I'd still say to start with Uncharted 1, although I don't consider it to be in the same league as Uncharted 2 and 3.

You can sneak around, but some areas will have to be cleared to advanced to the next stage. Not to ''sell the story short'', it's not a tear jerker and more light hearted than TLOU.

uncharted,1ykk1y,samsaBEAR,-5,Mon Feb 24 13:11:43 2014 UTC,"The game will be good then. U3 clearly needed more time. Naughty Dog was spread too thin between The last of Us and U3. I think a lot of people, including myself, assumed U3 would be great because it seems that Naughty Dog only gets better with time. I think this is still true as long as they have the proper resources. They were able to focus 100% on U2 and it was good. They were under too much pressure from Sony to release U3. I think U4 will be really good with this long development cycle."

For example without fail every time I play the Talbot chase in Yemen at some point during the chase the entire map will disappear mid-chase and I will have to start the chase over from the beginning. This same glitch has come up in other missions during other playthroughs as well but it happens most often during that particular chase. There have also been instances where the sound will cut out completely during cutscenes or gameplay for minutes at a time, or fight scenes will crash and you have to reset the console."

That sounds like pretty much exactly what was happening to me.  The laser made it through a few other games for about 3 more months, then I had to order a new one and replace it (not too hard with the right screwdrivers and a quick youtube search).  The hardest part is getting the right laser--the ones sold on Amazon are cheap Chinese replacement parts that go out almost immediately.  I had to get one from an eBay seller.  When you look at the lens assembly listed for sale, make sure you don't see a white plastic tab on the side (I've googled for a link to show you what I'm talking about but I can't seem to find the original PS3 forum post that tipped me off--sorry I can't be more specific)."
uncharted,1xnfpw,brianqueso,2,Wed Feb 12 07:07:00 2014 UTC,"Heh, this reminds me of my issue with my PS3 (slim) it won't read the discs of U3 and TLoU (and only U3 and TLoU) without warming up (ie playing another game for a few minutes)  first. This should bug me, but it mostly just makes me love Naughty Dog more."
uncharted,1xnfpw,Bethorz,0,Wed Feb 12 18:45:30 2014 UTC,I had a launch 60 GB backwards compatible fat boy that would flat out freeze at a certain point in UC3.
uncharted,1xfhqw,Zahand,14,Sun Feb 9 12:37:06 2014 UTC,"I would definitely say the first Uncharted is pretty heavy on shooting in comparison to 2 and 3, which have a lot more exploration and platforming."
uncharted,1xfhqw,TheSkittle,8,Sun Feb 9 13:47:23 2014 UTC,"I'll piggyback off the top comment because it's right, but also that the OP should know that I think there is some definite growth in the fighting with each sequel are there are some other points to be made about the combat evolution in Uncharted.   I would say that there was less shooting with each game that came out. In Uncharted 2, while there's still a bunch of gunplay, it's not always one long push through holding down the trigger like Drake's Fortune was, and there are some pretty memorable firefights. Uncharted 3 has the least amount of gunplay out of all 4 games to the extent that one could practically rattle off all of the specific firefights that take place in the game off of the top of their head.   I think this is because Naughty Dog realized that Uncharted's action could not sustain itself purely off of its standard cover-shooting mechanic. Uncharted started to move away from being an almost corridor shooter to being an almost a free-flow arena combat, where the action became all about utilizing the space, geometry, and supplemental objects (turrets, explosive objects, additional guns, weak building supports, etc.) of the wider environment to defeating chains of enemies.   Another thing that brought the focus off of shooting in the stories was the growth of hand-to-hand combat in the series. Melee evolved from being hardly supplemental in Uncharted 1, to a close-quarters shortcut in 2, to almost being a combat alternative in 3. In fact, the idea that a couple of the fights in 2 and several large ones in 3 (including the final boss fight) were entirely hand-to-hand shows that Naughty Dog wanted to shift the games away from being shooter/adventures into being a broader action/adventure.   Personally, I think Uncharted combat is showcased best during the pirate chapters and desert chapters in 3.   (P.S. to OP) You should know that the sequels also have not only large segments but entire chapters without any action or even puzzles, and are dedicated to either immersing yourself in the environment and peoples or just experiencing the personal and emotional hardships with Nathan Drake. If that sounds any more reassuring to you that the gameplay pacing shifts around in the sequels."
uncharted,1xfhqw,MetroidAndZeldaFan,3,Sun Feb 9 23:04:32 2014 UTC,Uncharted 1 put me in rage for the same reason. Uncharted 2 is much more balanced and the shooting is a lot funner because you can approach each encounter in different ways. I finished the first Uncharted and it was pretty good but I don't plan on coming back to it.  EDIT: I haven't played number 3 yet.
uncharted,1xfhqw,ITzzz_Ian,3,Sun Feb 9 18:41:03 2014 UTC,2 was the best all around game in my opinion
uncharted,1xfhqw,Aruu,2,Sun Feb 9 21:50:37 2014 UTC,"The shooty sections of UC2 and 3 tend to feel more in place, with more of a set-piece feel than UC1's gunfight to gunfight setup."
uncharted,1xfhqw,kacboy,2,Sun Feb 9 19:01:14 2014 UTC,"Uncharted 1 is very heavy on the shooting parts, but the later games are far more balanced. Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3 have a lot more 'exploring' parts, and the shooting parts are broken up fairly evenly."

uncharted,1vim3h,Gamer9131,12,Sat Jan 18 10:48:24 2014 UTC,"Uncharted 2 remains my favourite in both story, playability and music. It was the first uncharted I played and it was (as lame as this sounds) a life - changing experience. I had never played a video game with that level of attention to detail, cinematics and acting. I was not a big gamer so perhaps forgive if what I have said is blasphemy.   Uncharted 3 is a close second. Beautiful set pieces and again superb music and acting, but imo the story didn't flow quite as well  Finally U1 - scariest of the three. Those freaking Gollum things in the sewers were horrible. To me this is the uncharted prototype and so things were still being tried out. The limited set pieces is the major drawback for me, but game play and difficulty is top form"
uncharted,1vim3h,Matty321,3,Sat Jan 18 11:25:33 2014 UTC,"Damn, those descendants, I completely agree. I had no idea (I was playing them in order) that that would happen! I thought it was wolves running up the stairs.  And what you said isn't blasphemy haha. Naughty Dog are great at games, which is why we all love every one!"
uncharted,1vim3h,OrangeLightning4,3,Sat Jan 18 11:28:20 2014 UTC,The first time you see one of those things is in the big room where you have to go the path with the right numbers. They give you a prompt with the directionals to look a certain way and you just barely see its skin as it runs through the stone. It creeped me out so bad.
uncharted,1vim3h,cube1701,2,Sat Jan 18 20:15:59 2014 UTC,I just thought it was wolves. I was surprised...
uncharted,1vim3h,AnreteaXul,3,Sun Jan 19 03:32:25 2014 UTC,"I'd say Uncharted 2 first, with the best set pieces and story, along with great gameplay. Second would be Uncharted 3, which felt a bit lacking in some parts of the main game, but overall was great.  Next is Golden Abyss, which, despite being a handheld game, still feels like a full title. Uncharted 1 is last because it began to feel like a bit of a chore by the end."
uncharted,1vim3h,BlackNyellow,2,Sat Jan 18 13:07:48 2014 UTC,"I loved UC1, but that might be because I played it first."
uncharted,1vim3h,OrangeLightning4,3,Sat Jan 18 16:18:46 2014 UTC,"2, 3, 1.   Uncharted 2 had the perfect balance of story and gameplay, and they meshed well together. Uncharted 3's story felt a bit disjointed at times and the action scenes went from just barely believable to completely over the top but it was still real good fun to play. Uncharted 1 had way too many shootouts for my liking, it was like every single room you entered, you had to shoot it out with 50 more guys."
uncharted,1vim3h,UnholyTeemo,2,Sat Jan 18 15:22:35 2014 UTC,Uncharted 1 was the worst with sending a stupid amount of guys at you in one room or certain area.

uncharted,1vim3h,lifeleecher,2,Sat Jan 18 20:13:13 2014 UTC,"Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3, Uncharted 1.    Uncharted 2 is/was widely considered one of the best games of all time. It had tight gunplay, an immersive story, and a fleshed out multiplayer. It had breathtaking graphics and set pieces, the dialogue was witty and Nate was both bad-ass and relate-able at the same time. My all time favorite game goes to Oblivion (mainly because of nostalgia, and it got me into gaming), but Uncharted 2 has a special place in my heart. On PS3, it was the first game I loved so much I platinumed it.    Uncharted 3 was close. It had great setpieces, great graphics, great gunplay. It improved on every aspect of the Uncharted 2. However, it didn't really innovate it. It felt like the same game with a different story. It was by no means a bad game, but I felt like it was resting on its laurels.    Uncharted 1 was, in my opinion, a tech demo. It was unpolished. It was fun but flawed. The gunplay was lacking, the setpieces were average, and the story was rather dull (until you started shooting zombies, which were fucking terrifying). Again, not a bad game, but nothing very special, either."
uncharted,1vim3h,Boldizzle,2,Sat Jan 18 23:01:11 2014 UTC,"The First Game.  I agree with all of you with what you are saying, and I have thought about this question for some time now (long before this post) and for me I came to a very simple conclusion.  The first game is my favourite for the reason that is was the first in the series I played and this series (Naughty Dog in general, really) is the game that brought nostalgia of my younger self as a game. This game/series is the soul reason why I became and still am a gamer. It was such a thrill to venture through and by the time I finished, I wanted more, luckily by that time Uncharted 2 was already released and the third was only months away from release. :)"

uncharted,1vccti,qwertyuiop357,3,Thu Jan 16 20:27:08 2014 UTC,Lol fuck that. I'm playing on Easy for Uncharted 4. I think I'll enjoy the game a lot more.
uncharted,1vccti,Notoris,5,Thu Jan 16 20:29:47 2014 UTC,"I wanted so bad to start 3 on hard, but couldn't bring my self to do it. Remembering the horror of Platinuming the first two. Ill play 4 on normal then go back through for the other difficulties."
uncharted,1vccti,caveman_chubs,2,Thu Jan 16 20:32:24 2014 UTC,I'm struggling on the ship on UC3 right now.
uncharted,1vccti,loganwebby,3,Thu Jan 16 21:47:42 2014 UTC,"I'm assuming you are playing the 2nd one now, what part are you at that is so hard?"
uncharted,1vccti,buttholemuffin,3,Thu Jan 16 06:06:16 2014 UTC,"I actually just got through Chapter 19 of the third one.   The parts that are so hard are the ones where there are, like, 20 enemies coming at you in waves, which include some snipers, an RPG guy, a few of those heavily armored guys with shotguns that kill you in two shots, and a shield guy. There are a few of those in each game. And, like I said, they flank like crazy and throw grenade after grenade and run right up to you while you're trying to shoot other enemies. It's insane."
uncharted,1vccti,Gamer9131,3,Thu Jan 16 06:12:55 2014 UTC,"Wait, which game are you referring to?   Because for me, I started on Uncharted 2, played that on normal, hard, then crushing. Then I went over to Uncharted 1 and struggled with Normal. Uncharted 1, for me at least, kicked my ass. Uncharted 3 also proved to be slightly more difficult than two, but not too much for me."
uncharted,1vccti,buttholemuffin,1 point,Thu Jan 16 16:13:22 2014 UTC,"Some of the gunfights are quite hard and you'll have to play them over and over and over again until you can figure out a pattern of where to take cover, who to kill in what order and which weapons to use. Just keep an eye on where the enemies come from (they always come from a specific place, and then move in relation to your location).  Most of the time you should be fine as long as you stay in cover. You'll have to move when a grenade is thrown at you and you need to keep an eye on enemies sneaking up on you from behind. I would also advise starting on the lowest difficulty and working your way up each playthrough so you get an idea of how the AI works."

uncharted,1v1cp8,CherryQuench,7,Sun Jan 12 16:51:10 2014 UTC,"I played in the multiplayer beta and got the game on day one and for me, Uncharted TV was a brilliant idea. From the beginning it's been a great addition to the game. The fact that user generated content is played while you're playing the game is genius.   Honestly, I'm surprised that TLOU doesn't have something similar.   With the video recording and sharing capabilities of the PS4, I hope we see more content like Uncharted TV for years to come."
uncharted,1v1cp8,Captain_Sugar,4,Sun Jan 12 17:52:13 2014 UTC,"It would ruin the serious tone of TloU and the simple menus, also there was no cinematic tools."

Half of me agrees and says that would totally ruin the dark vibe of TLoU in the menus and that, but another half of me thinks if it does the same transition to play as Uncharted's does, I don't think it would be bothered."
uncharted,1v1cp8,qwertyuiop357,3,Mon Jan 13 15:12:47 2014 UTC,"It's awesome. Love it. Cool way to show off some Clan vids, tutorials, and jokes.

uncharted,1uu78k,morphinapg,2,Fri Jan 10 04:47:25 2014 UTC,Highly unlikely. Probably early to mid 2015. Late 2014 at the earliest.
uncharted,1uu78k,Hazdownvote,1 point,Fri Jan 10 07:51:08 2014 UTC,I honestly think that we can only be sure about the official release date when Naughty Dog them self announces the release date which will probably be November 2014
uncharted,1uu78k,zestylimeo,1 point,Fri Jan 10 18:09:58 2014 UTC,"I think it's pretty early, but I'll agree with morphinapg with late 2014 being the earliest.   Based on how they introduced and marketed The Last Of Us, the game was teased in 2011, demo'd E3 2012 and came out roughly a year and a bit later."
uncharted,1uu78k,aydee123,1 point,Fri Jan 10 22:37:44 2014 UTC,"Didn't they just release TLOU? Naughty Dog, like a lot of other devs, usually release a game every two years.   I'm guessing Spring 2015 at the earliest, though this is a different circumstance since the PS4 is new and it'd be odd for Sony's marquee dev to release their first game a year-and-a-half after launch. Maybe we'll see it Q4 2014?"

uncharted,1uu78k,0pie666,0,Sat Jan 18 18:27:57 2014 UTC,meh... it seem to be early for a game that they only show a teaser. Im not gonna get my hopes up on this.
uncharted,1ucyl9,Alex-E,2,Sat Jan 4 02:03:09 2014 UTC,"Sounds like you have the same problem I had. I played through Uncharted 1 and 2, both games were laggy, the audio was choppy or unsyncronized and sometimes the music didn't play at all. I tried Uncharted 3, but it turned out to be unplayable after a short time.   Luckily I found a solution!  If it's not your disc or your cable, then it's most likely your hdd. Apparently Uncharted and a handfull of other games (like Fallout 3) can have real problems with your hdd. That is why some games work perfectly and some don't work at all. (I played both Guitar Hero and Prince of Persia without problems, but Uncharted did not work)  You might want to consider replacing your hdd. You can buy a brand new replacement, but I would consider finding a used laptop instead. I replaced my PS3's hdd with that of an old laptop I didn't use anymore. After I formated the thing it worked like a charm. It's a pretty easy process actually. All you need is a screwdriver and a usb-memory stick."
uncharted,1ucyl9,tobzors,1 point,Thu Jan 23 15:22:44 2014 UTC,"I'm experiencing the same issue. For me it happens in multiple games, however it didn't happen when I first purchased Uncharted 3. I think it's just my Playstation getting old, maybe that's a lazy excuse but I've had no luck trying to fix it."
uncharted,1ucyl9,Nathan16,1 point,Sat Jan 4 07:36:27 2014 UTC,"It still sounds like a disc issue. Do you have a friend that has the game as well? Can you rent it? If it was me, I would try to find another copy and play that on my system to see if the same things happen. That's just me. If your ps3 runs other games ok, I would have to think it was the disc even if it appears to be ok."
uncharted,1ucntw,rob_mcm,2,Fri Jan 3 23:58:03 2014 UTC,"It was a fun story, an easy read.  If you can find it used for a couple bucks, it's worth it."

uncharted,1ucntw,qwertyuiop357,2,Sat Jan 4 03:08:22 2014 UTC,"It was fun to read an Uncharted story, but I felt it was a bit over-written at times (e.g. lengthy descriptions of thoughts/feelings instead of progressing the plot at the same rapid pace as the games). I'm not the fastest reader, so that kind of distracted me, YMMV."

I'm looking forward to trying out all those MP maps I never had a chance to play.  Looks like the coop stuff is locked behind a pay wall if you're playing the free digital version though. I guess that makes sense since they never made coop F2P AFAIK.

uncharted,1t3iwa,arcade_13,7,Tue Dec 17 16:40:26 2013 UTC,"Lawrence of Arabia is a landmark in cinematic history for so many reasons. Its achievements in cinematography, direction, performance, among others have set a bar that few films even today still reach.   Its influence has been felt heavily in the film industry--and it can be seen as a driving creative inspiration for many movie makers such as Scorsese, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg (whom holds 'Lawrence' to be the best film ever made; and I personally agree).   Its influence does not stop at film though. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, in addition to following the archeological exploits of the early 20th Century English figure, shares several central narrative themes with Lawrence of Arabia, and also draws heavily upon the epic film in its artistic direction (both visually and musically) starting once Nathan Drake reaches the Middle East (especially in Chapter 18 onwards).   Lawrence of Arabia is more than just a film, it is a cinematic experience, and I believe it should be experienced by everyone at least once in their life. Watch the film on as large a screen as possible, and be sure to have the time for it as well (it's roughly 4 hours long, yet worth every second).  I cannot recommend it enough."
uncharted,1t3iwa,morphinapg,3,Tue Dec 17 16:49:41 2013 UTC,"That scene when he blows out the match gave me instant goosebumps.   I actually got into the Uncharted series because of the connection the 3rd game had with Lawrence. No film, in my opinion, will ever come close to the beauty and majesty that film had. Within the top ten of my bucket list is to see that movie on the big screen. This is one of the other great scenes of the movie, if anyone is interested.  Thank you for the post, OP."

uncharted,1si9y3,Gamer9131,4,Tue Dec 10 05:00:42 2013 UTC,"A story like the original, but guns, graphics, physics, and ""free roam"" like the latest one. Like if they mixed The Last of Us, Assassins Creed, and UC3."
uncharted,1si9y3,QuadraQ,1 point,Tue Dec 10 19:41:27 2013 UTC,Like the latest one? Is there free roam in UC3? Don't spoil the story please btw.
uncharted,1si9y3,TunaFishy-,2,Tue Dec 10 01:31:32 2013 UTC,"No free roam in UC3, it's limited like the rest of the games. But they hide the limited-ness better."
uncharted,1si9y3,dpblair1984,1 point,Fri Jan 17 07:48:14 2014 UTC,Then what free Roma was being talked about?
uncharted,1si9y3,amazingseiderman,1 point,Fri Jan 17 18:23:37 2014 UTC,Spoilers.
uncharted,1si9y3,caveman_chubs,1 point,Fri Jan 17 18:24:27 2014 UTC,What? It's fine you can spoil now.
uncharted,1si9y3,Gamer9131,1 point,Fri Jan 17 18:43:26 2014 UTC,"There are parts during the game with much more limited access that seems entirely free roam, but isn't. I honestly couldn't give an accurate example because it's been since the launch since I played UC3. You just have to play the game to completely understand."
uncharted,1sesaj,afgballa24,9,Sun Dec 8 21:31:29 2013 UTC,"Well, I've seen the ""highlights"" of the show (the Cringe-cut video) and I'm happy that they didn't show it on VGX. There are better stages for the first peak into U4...  But besides that, I'm also bummed that we still know this little, haha."
uncharted,1sesaj,Rocr,2,Sun Dec 8 22:27:51 2013 UTC,yeah the sucked overall but man i would love to know more anything about uncharted or even anything naughty dog is doing other than of course the last of us dlc
uncharted,1sesaj,MrZebraGamer,6,Mon Dec 9 00:54:52 2013 UTC,There was even a confirmed source (If I recall correctly it was a Tweet from one of the hosts) saying that Sony had a big announcement for the VGXs. Still nothing. Overall a bad show.
uncharted,1sesaj,Frogloggers,1 point,Sun Dec 8 23:24:42 2013 UTC,They were meant to show footage of The Order: 1886 but the footage wasn't ready. I assume Ready At Dawn were the ones who called the footage back considering that they are quite geeky when it comes to small details.
uncharted,1sesaj,KungFooRobot,2,Sat Dec 21 20:25:18 2013 UTC,"I'd imagine that what we've already seen is about all that exists of U4 thus far. It would have been cool, though."
uncharted,1sesaj,morphinapg,2,Mon Dec 9 01:58:51 2013 UTC,"They've been working on it since Uncharted 3 came out. They may not have very many cinematics done or anything, as that seems to have just started production, but there's a good chance they have significant level design and engine work done, as well as models for any characters."
uncharted,1sesaj,KungFooRobot,2,Mon Dec 9 04:59:45 2013 UTC,I didn't realize that they had been working on it for so long. This is very good news.
uncharted,1sesaj,morphinapg,2,Mon Dec 9 05:01:28 2013 UTC,"Historically, when motion capture starts, there's about a year left in production. Slightly more in Last of Us's case."
uncharted,1sesaj,morphinapg,1 point,Mon Dec 9 05:05:07 2013 UTC,I remember Nolan North stating that he started working on motion capture for Uncharted 3 in early 2010; which came out late 2011. I could see at least a year and a half left of production. I think Q4 2015 isn't so outlandish anymore.
uncharted,1s3k8f,JimboMS,5,Wed Dec 4 19:22:05 2013 UTC,Oh words cannot describe how much I love this!!!
uncharted,1s3k8f,KamiHaruko,2,Wed Dec 4 20:39:20 2013 UTC,Very interesting theory! Cant wait to see how it turns out
uncharted,1s3k8f,Craiken,2,Wed Dec 4 21:29:17 2013 UTC,There's a few more links. They have basically a confirmation that NN is gonna be doing his parts soon.
uncharted,1s3k8f,Sugiebb,1 point,Wed Dec 4 23:50:07 2013 UTC,"Isn't the monologue in the trailer an actual quote from someone, IIRC? (Obviously not the original person saying it though.)"
uncharted,1s3k8f,Sir_Llama,1 point,Thu Dec 5 05:17:37 2013 UTC,"I think the twist is going to be that Nate actually is related to Drake, and that's why he chose the name. Being the smart kid he was, and missing his family, he goes searching for answers and finds out he's actually related to Francis Drake."

uncharted,1rg6zo,ControllerMartin,13,Mon Nov 25 22:22:02 2013 UTC,Uggggg hurry nd... hurry
uncharted,1rg6zo,LoneLyon,3,Tue Nov 26 00:45:41 2013 UTC,Usually mocap is done for the last year or so of development.
uncharted,1rg6zo,morphinapg,2,Tue Nov 26 11:18:23 2013 UTC,That late?
uncharted,1rg6zo,LoneLyon,2,Wed Nov 27 06:50:05 2013 UTC,"Usually yeah. Story, level design, gameplay, and engine improvements are all some of the first things they do. Then motion capture starts about a year or so before release, and the story is also typically refined during this year as well, with some scenes still being written while others are recorded. Although after Last of Us they may prefer to give themselves more time as that seemed to help them out a lot. At earliest I would say Uncharted 4 would release late 2014, but it could be later."
uncharted,1rg6zo,morphinapg,1 point,Wed Nov 27 06:58:38 2013 UTC,Why aren't they calling it Uncharted 4?
uncharted,1rg6zo,LostInThisWorldx,2,Tue Nov 26 16:41:00 2013 UTC,"They probably aren't sure what the subtitle will be yet so they showed off that they are, in fact, working on a 4th console Uncharted and will probably release a number along with the subtitle.   Or maybe they're doing what Uncharted: Golden Abyss did and have a prequel/sidequel and have no number because of no progression--seeing as U3 wrapped up Nate's adventuring life."
uncharted,1rg6zo,LostInThisWorldx,1 point,Wed Dec 4 07:21:23 2013 UTC,"Oh yeah, good point. I can't wait!"
uncharted,1rg6zo,zackmanze,1 point,Wed Dec 4 11:13:51 2013 UTC,"I think it's pretty clear from the trailer that this is the sequel to U3, tracking a former friend of Nate's whom Nate betrayed coming back to destroy Drakes life.   Drake gave it up, and now he's getting dragged back into it."
uncharted,1rg6zo,CsVictory,1 point,Fri Jan 3 10:41:14 2014 UTC,I'm getting a Tomb Raider vibe from this...

uncharted,1rdcpb,Alecendur,3,Sun Nov 24 21:27:34 2013 UTC,Assume that is a placeholder.
uncharted,1rdcpb,kacboy,2,Mon Nov 25 05:00:13 2013 UTC,...I'm fine with this.
uncharted,1rdcpb,nazthetech,3,Sun Nov 24 21:38:53 2013 UTC,I guess it doesn't rush me to get a ps4!
uncharted,1rdcpb,Alecendur,3,Sun Nov 24 21:54:51 2013 UTC,I hope this is wrong. 2015 is too far away!
uncharted,1rdcpb,LostInThisWorldx,2,Sat Nov 30 22:58:24 2013 UTC,"I've always been an Xbox guy, but I'm going with Playstation for next-gen, mainly for this game."
uncharted,1rdcpb,CsVictory,1 point,Sun Dec 1 22:56:49 2013 UTC,"2015 is the perfect amount year for release.  Uncharted is far and ahead my favorite franchise across all mediums, but man I had my fill of it for a while back. We got an Uncharted PS3 game every 2 years, and then we got two fully-fledged Uncharted games within like 4 months of each other (Drake's Deception and Golden Abyss).   I can go another year without it, and I'm sure by then I'll be so hungry and antsy for another one I won't be able to wait for it to come."
uncharted,1r7xfo,ActionFigurer,3,Fri Nov 22 15:05:12 2013 UTC,Yeah it better give you a hand job for 159.99
uncharted,1r7xfo,mugginns,2,Sat Nov 23 02:55:14 2013 UTC,Except the price.
uncharted,1r7xfo,kacboy,1 point,Fri Nov 22 15:18:42 2013 UTC,"It's a good looking figure, much better than the one that came with the collector's edition of U3, except I don't get why there hasn't been a single figure that actually looks like Nate in the games."
uncharted,1r7xfo,whacafan,1 point,Sun Nov 24 18:12:49 2013 UTC,What I don't like is that he's never made that face before.
uncharted,1r6fpx,Hm_Butter,1 point,Thu Nov 21 23:52:56 2013 UTC,"I am sorry for not having given any updates regarding this in over a month.  Apparently, the fundraiser is going to end now in Christmas Day. As of writing this post, $40,537 of the $47,000 goal has been reached (I wrote $48,000 earlier, and I want to apologize for that. As far as I understand, the goal is $47,000), so the $18,000 for David's surgery and the $20,000 for after it should now have been reached, and David's surgery has been scheduled.  The remaining amount of the goal is apparently for after care. In the following update, which as far as I understand was posted on the 22'nd November when $38,000 had been reached, it is explained a bit more what the rest of the money up to $47,000 should be for:   First off I just want to thank you all for the amazing amount of support we've received from the beginning to where we are now with this fundraiser!  The funds we've been able to raise are enough to get David the surgery he needs! We will be updating everyone soon with more details as they come in but the fight is not over yet!  The remaining amount we need to reach our goal is very important. It will cover all of David's after care needs such as follow-up appointments, medication, his nutritional needs as well as any treatments he still might need in the future.  We've decided to leave the fundraiser open until we're able to reach our goal! Again for those that are not able to help with money, you can really help with your words. Get this message out to all of those that haven't heard about our cause yet and let's get this goal reached!  You can also help by buying any merchandise that is currently for sale at ThatVigilante.com  Our free shipping code is still active: FREESHIP001  All the money raised from the website will added to our overall goal frequently.  You're all an inspiration and again we thank each and every one of you that have helped out!  Jackson   As mentioned earlier, it seems like they have decided to end the fundraiser now on the 25'th December. Here are the two latest updates that were uploaded to the GoFundMe page, starting with the older of the two:   Update: David's surgery has been scheduled!! We're going to be ending the fundraiser on Christmas Day! More news to come!  Please continue to share this page with anyone that can help us reach our goal!  Thank you,  Jackson   And then posting the latest:   Our fundraiser is ending tomorrow!  Let everyone know!  For those still wanting to help out, you still have time!  We can do this!  Help give the best gift of all!  Merry Christmas Eve and Happy Holidays!   Here is another update that has been posted on the fundraiser website:   Real quick, I just wanted to give a huge thanks to everyone from the NeoGAF community that have been doing everything possible to help David and our cause!  We also want to thank and mention someone who has gone above and beyond to help David during his fight!  Alicia Tai,  You have been such an incredible help and we wouldn't have gotten this far without you!  There are a few others we'd like to thank but we've been asked to keep them anonymous.  Thanks again to everyone for your help! I will be posting another update very soon covering all the details of David's journey!  Please continue to let everyone know how close we are to our goal and how they can help!  Jackson   And here is a message from David, that was from before I created this thread, that I forgot to post. I believe it was posted in an update on the fundraiser at 20'th November. I copied the part of the update that included his message:   ( I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for every type of support I've received. I could have never done this without your friendship, love and support and just knowing you have my back is helping me fight harder than ever.  The pain I'm going through has increased but I'm hanging in there. I'm resting as much as I can in-between what I need to take care of. I've been able to see my family with the break I've had from work and I'm cherishing every second.  I'm going to keep this short, but before I go I just want to say that my work was not only inspired by the games we all love but also by the idea of following your dreams and being able to do what you love for a living. To wake up everyday and feel a sense of excitement and being able to share what you create with everyone. It's a truly remarkable feeling.  I want to keep that dream alive.  Thank you again so very much!  Sincerely, David Vigil )   More updates can be found at the GoFundMe page for those who wish to read more (click on the ""More Updates"" button to show more updates): http://www.gofundme.com/THEFIGHTBEGINS  Thank you for reading."

uncharted,1r28bx,GuruGold,3,Wed Nov 20 19:57:17 2013 UTC,The first is my favorite in some ways. The last 1/3 is awesome!
uncharted,1r28bx,madshm3411,4,Wed Nov 20 18:44:33 2013 UTC,"I agree, I love the first one.  Maybe it's because it was my introduction to the series, but I think the story in the first one is the most fun - just a straight up treasure hunt set on a remote island."
uncharted,1r28bx,Electro_Jade,1 point,Thu Nov 21 01:36:05 2013 UTC,"You'll be disappointed. But play it if you're interested in the characters and their storylines. I played U1 again after finishing U3, and the graphics and gameplay made me cringe. Still an excellent game though.. just not up to par with U2 and U3 standards."

uncharted,1r1pe5,paragpn21,1 point,Wed Nov 20 15:59:30 2013 UTC,I bought uncharted 3 used. Luckly the online code wasn't used so I used it. The online won't work though. When I press play online it doesn't load up?
uncharted,1r1pe5,The-MERTEGER,3,Sun Dec 29 20:26:44 2013 UTC,"played it last night. I wasn't able to find games as quickly as I was able to a couple of months ago, but still pretty active. And all the maps are free to dl and play? And a sweet shotgun lab? Hell yes."
uncharted,1r1pe5,stash0606,3,Wed Nov 20 18:20:08 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure how active the game is but I continually find matches in Team Deathmatch, occasionally in Team Objective and Three Team Deathmatch, and even the other night some Elimination. I recently started playing it again and have been having a blast!"
uncharted,1r1pe5,SMKM,3,Fri Nov 22 21:07:13 2013 UTC,"Sorry--a little late.   Still active. Good community.   The game is free to play on the PSN, but caps some things (level, weapon mods, skins) for the F2P players. So I think it'd be a good idea to try the free version to see if you wanna go all in for the paid version."

uncharted,1r1pe5,ourannual,1 point,Sat Dec 7 18:46:30 2013 UTC,"I had to play some online matches in Uncharted 3 in order to platinum the game, which I did only a month or two ago. I was surprised to find a community that's still very active, and ended up playing for longer than I expected to. Really fun stuff!"
uncharted,1r1ewi,stevyjohny,15,Wed Nov 20 05:00:55 2013 UTC,It was more like afterward I realized I had no idea what happened. During he first playthrough it was f'ing great.
uncharted,1r1ewi,kacboy,9,Wed Nov 20 06:54:53 2013 UTC,This. I was gearing up for a final boss battle...   And then the game was over without one (I don't remember how to tag spoilers so I'm not going to include them).
uncharted,1r1ewi,flumpis,5,Wed Nov 20 13:40:47 2013 UTC,"I hated the final battle on UC3: the fist fight with Talbot. It just came down to a button mash.  Also, on the second play through I quit out of the final cut scene and it crashed the game. I was taken all the way back to the start of chapter 21 and had to do the fight again. Which was annoying.  I don't have a 3D TV and I think it would have been much better in 3D."
uncharted,1r1ewi,TheMightyPrince,15,Wed Nov 20 14:28:03 2013 UTC,I thought it was better than the dumb fight with Lazarabitch. You just ran in circles for that one...
uncharted,1r1ewi,qwertyuiop357,7,Wed Nov 20 14:31:22 2013 UTC,"I loved that fight. I felt there was a lot more skill involved, and it actually felt like the stakes were a lot higher. With Talbot it seemed like there was supposed to be more that just never came."
uncharted,1r1ewi,flumpis,5,Wed Nov 20 15:06:57 2013 UTC,"I'll have to respectfully disagree. With the fight against Talbot, all it was supposed to be was a fistfight between two relatively equal guys, which it was."
uncharted,1r1ewi,qwertyuiop357,4,Wed Nov 20 15:12:53 2013 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean skillwise, which is fine. But the stakes are incredibly low for the Uncharted series, and for game 3 in the series. There's all sorts of supernatural stuff going on throughout the series, and the story arc ends with a fistfight? It's really disappointing."
uncharted,1r1ewi,flumpis,1 point,Wed Nov 20 15:34:14 2013 UTC,"Oooo, don't know about that. After killing that guy 4 or 5 times on crushing I really thought I'd mastered the game (the last time was the night that psn went down for a month). I'm just not good with really, really, fast button pushes."
uncharted,1r1ewi,TheMightyPrince,1 point,Wed Nov 20 14:48:56 2013 UTC,"I just never was a fan of repetitive actions. Yes, button presses are repetitive too, but you don't know the exact sequence of button presses you need to have at every single moment in the Talbot fight. I guess it's just personal preference."

uncharted,1r1ewi,JakeCampFire,1 point,Sun Dec 22 00:59:20 2013 UTC,"I feel a large majority haven't played GA (including myself). How was it, compared to the others?"
uncharted,1r1ewi,JakeCampFire,1 point,Sun Dec 22 04:46:35 2013 UTC,"One of the best handheld games I've ever played. And considering there hasn't been an original three dimensional zelda on handheld I would say the best handheld game I've ever played. Of course the graphics aren't as good as the others (comparable to drakes fortune) but the story was fun, the usage of the vita hardware for things like the touchscreen, rear touchpad, and gyro were really well done, and the dynamic between the two villains added some new flavor to the characters. The new female lead (drakes ex gf as golden abyss is a prequel) was not likable in the slightest and compared to Elana (my favorite character in the series) she is just dead weight. Sully brings in the much needed comic relief at the start of the third act and as far as boss battles go I would say guerro comes in second only to Lazarevic. The lack of the supernatural and overall lack of scale is fitting for prequel and feels very natural. The number one thing to praise though is the length, I've noticed handheld entries of AAA franchises are usually noticeably shorter than the console games but this was not the case. This game consisted of 34 chapters compared to 22 in drakes fortune, 26 in among thieves, and 22 in drakes deception. I'm a really big fan of a sequel or prequel expanding on the existing story and that's why 1 and 3 are my favorites but between the two that are independent stories I liked golden abyss significantly more than among thieves."

That caught me way off guard."
uncharted,1r1ewi,LegendaryGinger,1 point,Sun Dec 22 06:45:20 2013 UTC,"I was hopeful when they said they had a big announcement to make. I wasn't believing anything till I heard it from the horses mouth. I had basically filed away uncharted 4 with my other ultimate games that I want like half life 3, and the third hero of time game as a possibility but I refuse to torment myself with thoughts of it. Needless to say it's currently my most anticipated upcoming officially announced game but that will change at E3. What are your thoughts on what you want to see in it?"
uncharted,1r1ewi,Blink182ismeh,1 point,Sun Dec 22 07:36:49 2013 UTC,"Honestly, I like the direction they were moving in in UC3. Despite the lack of medals and tedious semi-involved cinematic moments (the ten minute desert walk for instance). I'm leaning towards the possibility of a sequel to drakes deception rather than the story taking place in any other part of the story line. I think it'd be interesting if they moved the story forward a few years and Nate starts mentoring someone similar to the way Sully mentored him."

uncharted,1r1ewi,QuadraQ,11,Fri Nov 29 01:52:38 2013 UTC,"I loved uncharted 3 the story may of not have been the best but the gameplay, how close the camera was, and the action made it the best uncharted and one of the best games I've ever played.   The airplane scene, and the boat going down was so amazing and then wondering the dessert, seeing the stars was breathtaking. That game is amazing I love it very much."
uncharted,1r1ewi,twisted_by_design,6,Wed Nov 20 07:31:08 2013 UTC,"i think a lot of it was the fact they reported on all the set pieces before hand. before the game came out, i knew about the cruise ship, the plane crash, and the desert. so when you're fighting your way through a shipyard, you kinda know where its going and whats gonna happen. later on, you're fighting your way through an airport, and you see it coming. i think that ruined it for me.   they were going for these amazing, huge set pieces that werent surprises at all. i preferred the pleasant surprises that were u2. ie, the truck chasing you down the alley at the start of the city level, the helicopter taking down the hotel, carrying the camera guy while being chased, the tank fight in the mountain village. all done way better than u3. IMO, of course"
uncharted,1r1ewi,zackmanze,3,Wed Nov 20 20:01:53 2013 UTC,"While I understand it wasn't as big of a technical leap as 2 was over 1, I actually preferred 3 to 2."

uncharted,1qutww,SMKM,7,Mon Nov 18 18:19:17 2013 UTC,"Naughty Dog really put a lot of effort into both Uncharted and The Last of Us. They both play like interactive movies, look beautiful and play wonderfully. That said, there are some differences between the two, both from a gameplay standpoint and a story standpoint.   A big difference in how the game plays is that Uncharted is almost a shooter. There are tons of bad guys, and unlike The Last of Us, you won't be able to sneak around many of them. You will be constantly running, taking cover and shooting. Everything is very active, and you'll find that there's a shoutout in pretty much every area you explore.  Story-wise, Uncharted is top notch. The series follows Nathan Drake, a modern treasure hunter, going off to find fortune in a variety of places across the globe. Along the way you'll meet new and interesting characters, exchange blows with dastardly foes and, of course, watch Nathan attempt to charm the ladies.  Overall, it's a fun ride. It's got an ""Indiana Jones"" feel to it, and frankly there aren't many games that could pull off the story as well as Naughty Dog has done with Uncharted. The dark and gritty, post-apocalyptic atmosphere of The Last of Us was amazing; but kiss it goodbye, because Uncharted is vivid, action packed and full of kick-some-ass, find-some-treasure and win-the-girl's-heart excitement.  You'll love it."
uncharted,1qutww,iBevolution,2,Mon Nov 18 04:04:06 2013 UTC,"This is a great summary, much appreciated! I think I'll prefer the shooter aspects of the game. The stealth aspects of TLOU was bad for my heart ;)"

uncharted,1qutww,virtual-toast,4,Mon Nov 18 18:23:40 2013 UTC,"considered uncharted 1 a test run for what 2 and 3 are.   uncharted 2 in the pinnacle in my opinion. tied with TLOU for best ps3 game. the set pieces are fucking amazing and great fun to play multiple times through.  uncharted 3 is good, but it didn't live up to the hype or personal expectations. worth completing to see the story. if i remember correctly the mechanics are the most refined throughout the series in 3.   if you've played TLOU, you will definitely see how it evolved from the uncharted series. they are all great imo, but TLOU is the pinnacle of naughty dogs achievements (so far.. fingers cross for uncharted ps4! :)  TL;DR: uncharted 2 still gives me a boner to this day"

They're just so engaging and beautiful and well written and just so much damn fun. You'll laugh and cry, you'll play for hours and get frustrated over puzzles. You can also see how Naughty Dog developed their style throughout the series and then passed that onto TLoU.  TL;DR: The Uncharted series is just phenomenal and if you loved TLoU then you'll definitely love Uncharted."

uncharted,1quulz,Salute_The_Bud,9,Sun Nov 17 23:53:00 2013 UTC,"Uncharted III was the first of the trilogy I played. I enjoyed it enough to subsequently buy I and II. With that in mind, here's a summary of my opinion:  Uncharted I: clearly an enjoyable game, and possibly set a bench-mark for quality as an early PS3 game...but pales in comparison to II and III. This is the only one I haven't played through more than once.  Uncharted II: I love this game to bits...the story, characters, writing, action, cinematics....everything about it...100%  Uncharted III: again, such a badass game that it hurts...if I really had to complain about it, my comments would be about the storyline, not the gameplay; eg. how does Talbot do magic? what was the point of the pirate sub-plot? why didn't I care when Chloe/Cutter left? etc. However, I did get immersed in the story overall enough to feel what Drake was feeling. Perhaps some things were shoehorned in (eg. the cruise ship level) just because they made for a badass scene/level...but man, they were absolutely spectacular.  UII and UIII both had me searching for more treasures in repeat playthroughs.  I could go on, but you get the idea: I don't feel let down by UIII at all."
uncharted,1quulz,Toasted-Dinosaur,6,Mon Nov 18 00:44:33 2013 UTC,"U3 is my favourite of the series, but I love them all a shitload and it's only marginally ahead of U2. U3 is just so goddamn beautiful and fun to play."
uncharted,1quulz,virtual-toast,4,Tue Nov 19 00:49:27 2013 UTC,"It's actually my favorite of the trilogy thus far. I thought the plot was pretty good, and gameplay was much better imo. Multiplayer is so much better than in the second one. Then again, maybe I say that because I'm better at 3 than 2."
uncharted,1quulz,qwertyuiop357,3,Mon Nov 18 02:00:29 2013 UTC,"U3 is mostly panned as a disappointment by the majority of fans. Everyone has their own reasons. The common ones were some felt the controls were a little off, difficult to aim etc, some people also had problems with the melee system saying it was a little unresponsive. Ironically, I actually enjoyed the melee changes even if they got a little repetitive. A lot of people had problems with the story as well. It just felt disjointed compared to 1 and 2.   Personally, I think 3 is still a fun pure action game. I have always enjoyed the Uncharted style gameplay. That being said, I just wasn't into the plot as much as the previous games. With 1 and 2, I was really hooked into the game and the story. 3 started off okay, but it seemed like naughtydog didn't really know where they were going with it. Maybe that is the result of choosing set pieces to build before coming up with a story. They did the same thing with 2, but manage to get away with it. Of course, one of their big technological pieces was the boat which ended up (being the most fun sequence in the game) but felt out of place from the main story.   So marlow hands you over to the pirate. The pirate says that Sully is there. He really isn't, but why would the pirate guy even bother lying about it if you are captured? I mean, there were just a lot of things for me that I didn't like. I could go on for a long time. The big ones were where they went with the magic water and the hallucinogens. How they brought down the entire city by shooting down one support structure. It seemed rushed.  Also, the game was about three hours shorter than u2. Overall, it just didn't take any steps forward. And I thought the multiplayer was almost the same as U2 despite how much effort they said they put into it."
uncharted,1quulz,stevyjohny,3,Tue Nov 19 02:37:36 2013 UTC,"This pretty much sums up my thoughts too while replaying it. While I still enjoy UIII, nothing will compare to Uncharted: Drake's Fortune in my opinion, and I love UII. The first just had this feeling to it. UII's story was great I felt, but I totally agree about UIII. The story, while mega in some parts, makes no sense in others. I think it's because they (Naughty Dog) were working on the Last of Us, so kinda threw a story together and said great, as long as the gameplay was amazing, which it is"
uncharted,1quulz,stevyjohny,3,Tue Nov 19 04:37:03 2013 UTC,"Totally, if you search on google you can find an article somewhere that explained Naughty Dogs reorganization of their company after U2. Unfortunately, I cannot remember what it was called. However, it explained how Naughty Dog split into two teams with many from the Uncharted 2 team going to work on The Last of Us. They hired some new people to make up the difference to become the Uncharted 3 team. The article doesn't really explain any details about the impact on the game itself, but it seems obvious to the reader that the reorganization must have had a drastic influence on the games quality.  There was another article I read also that went in depth about U3's issues. They interviewed one of the higher ups. I think it was Evan Wells. Sometime during the Summer of 2011 they were having huge problems with the game. It was supposed to be going to the final stages, but there were huge glitches. THey admitted they were totally maxing out the ps3. They eventually figured out some work around;however, as we now know, there were a lot of glitches. Whatever the big ones existed they must have fixed, but this was easily the most buggiest Uncharted game yet.  Overall, there are many reasons why this game just didn't come together. I think the reorganization had a huge impact. The game was glitchy and should have been delayed, but it wasn't. Also, Amy Hennig's story was not good enough to make up for all the other deficits."
uncharted,1quulz,stevyjohny,3,Tue Nov 19 10:15:37 2013 UTC,"Yeah I remember reading that as well. They said like Uncharted I was only like 60% of the PS3s power, Uncharted II was like 80%ish, and Uncharted III was all out. That's amazing though cause I still think it's amazing. Also has me pumped for Uncharted on PS4, cause if they maxed out the PS3, imagine with what they will do on PS4!  So apparently they meant the blu-ray disc memory. So I guess that's also PS3 memory as well?"
uncharted,1quulz,kacboy,3,Wed Nov 20 04:01:58 2013 UTC,"The one place I think Uncharted 3 faltered was the Ramses/Pirates chapters. Even though I would say that from a design standpoint that they are the best levels created in the series, from a narrative perspective it is a whole tangent from the main story and does nothing more than to reinforce the point that Nate would go to the ends of the Earth to save Sully--but they go ahead and make that point again with the following chapters anyway.  If Amy Hennig had found a smoother way to work it into the plot, then it would have been perfect.   Honestly, that's my biggest (and pretty much only) gripe with Uncharted 3, and even then the chapters were so bombastic and entertaining that I didn't mind it too much. Everything else I thought was a minor step up from Uncharted 2.   Building a story around set-pieces and locations isn't anything new--not to this series and not to popular storytelling. Hennig said that this was the process that they used for the games before, not just 3. Spielberg and Hitchcock, two directors whom a vast many would consider some of the greatest filmmakers (and even storytellers) of all time used the method of ""big moments first; tie together with story later.""   All-in-all, I thought the B-story and themes were much better in Drake's Deception and surprisingly poignant. The character arcs were much better, fleshing out lovable and charming beyond depth to the point of almost tangibility. The villains were by far the best of the series, threatening on not just a physical level, but a psychological and moral one as well. To follow up on that I'd say the actors gave their best performances in the franchise, and the dialogue had never been better.   Aside from a pretty hardcore tangent and a few minor plot-contrivances, I'd still say that 3 is the best of the series and 2 is the greatest (though I know many would disagree). Among Thieves, a masterpiece as well, had less plot contrivances because it told a much more simple tale than Drake's Deception did. 3 had a stutter or two, but it still went in full stride.   If I had to suggest something for Naughty Dog for the new PS4 installment, it'd be to go over and make sure everything makes sense from a narrative standpoint. Make sure A happens, and because of that B happens, and then C happens because of that, and so-on and so-on; not A happens, and then B happens because of that, and then 2 happens, and then we're back to C happening because of B.   Other than that, I'd let them do everything they're doing. They have a much larger development window than either 2 or 3, so I think they'll have plenty of time for self-edits."
uncharted,1quulz,stevyjohny,3,Tue Nov 19 05:22:06 2013 UTC,"I agree that Naughty Dog shot themselves in the foot with the shipyard sequence even though it was the funnest part in the game. Unfortunately, that's the risk you take when you choose set pieces before making the actual story. I guess a crumbling building being shot down by a helicopter is much easier to work into any story rather than a sinking ship. The sinking ship can only be in the ocean or a large lake. Not many options there.  I would disagree with everything else. I didn't like the character arcs because I thought they barely went anywhere.   The good:  Drake is an orphan when he meets Sully. Why though? Also, why its a little unclear why Sully adopts him other than he sees potential.  Marlow had a personal relationship with Sully and hence new drake. That makes for an interestin villain because she actually knows them other than Drake going up against another rogue bad guy.  I liked the basic premise of the story.  The bad (in my opinion)  Marlow isn't scary. She has a private army somehow just like Lazarivic. We don't know what happened to any of the characters in between 2 and 3. They make us figure out Drake and Elena's relationship on our own. They used the exact same spiders in two different locations. Almost all of the big brute bad guys look exactly the same. THe one that falls off the airplane is the exact same model as the one you later fight in the truck. Perhaps he fell into it. Talbot may or may not have had magical powers. We don't know enough about his character. Some of the scenery was ugly like that castle level."
uncharted,1quulz,sneedo,4,Tue Nov 19 10:30:12 2013 UTC,"I thought Uncharted 2 had the better A-Story (Main plot) and a decent B-Story (Thematic Plot); I thought Uncharted 3 had an almost-as-good A-Story but a fantastic and much better B-story.   I loved Marlowe as a villain because she was a threat to Nathan on just about every level. Physically, she had an army surrounding her; Mentally, she was capable of twisting Nate's head around; Morally and Psychologically, she knew Nate's secrets and could make him question his loved ones' and his own motives. And as big and bad as Lazaravic was, as great as Graham's performance as him, he was little more than standard fare pulp-adventure ""take over the world by force"" bad guy. Marlowe was colder, more calculating, ""let's infect the world to take over it--and break everyone on a moral level who tries to stop us.""   I also thought Talbot was a surprisingly fantastic supporting antagonist--and much better than either Durza or Navarro. He is the anti-Drake. He is Drake with resources, who doesn't have to really on grits and luck but on his own. His relationship with Marlowe was an intriguing foil to Nate and Sully. As for the magic, they hint at it but never visually reveal it in the end (which they should have), that much like their organization, he operates to deceive and trick his opponents--he was using slight-of hand tricks: trip wires, bulletproof vests, hallucinogens. Again, they should have revealed that a bit more, and I think if they explored that in the final boss-fight that would have been a more interesting thing to do--but I still dug him and what he was.   As for the lack of explanation for what happened to characters between the games, I liked that too. I mean, there wasn't much left up in the air besides Drake and Elena, and it was perfectly handled. Uncharted 3 was a de-romanticizing of a romantic genre, a deconstruction and analysis of the pulp-adventure and pulp-adventure hero. We see that Nate's love with discovering the truth, of thrill-seeking, of fighting bad guys, is a life-long obsession and it takes a tole on the relationships around him. It pushes Sully to his physical limits and puts him in harm, it nearly gets Cutter killed, it goes too far for Chloe to find it worth it anymore after she matured, and it hampers down on Nate and Elena's relationship for the second time--this time even breaking a marriage. Nathan and Elena's sexual tension from the past two titles were this time replaced with a nostalgia for that sexual tension (""just like old times"", ""deja vu""). The glory days of adventuring had passed and everyone grew up except Nate, and in the end we find out he's essentially a boy playing make-believe hero.   You can't really fault the bad guys looking the same without applying that to the other games as well. There were only like six different looking pirates in Uncharted 1 and hundreds of grunts in Uncharted 2 had the same two faces. It's something they actually got better with in Uncharted 3, everyone in the cult either has a uniform shaved head or uniform comb-back, and the pirates had randomized costumes.   The spiders were used by the order/nomads protecting Ubar's secret in Yemen and Syria, the Crusader also knew of the dangers of Ubar and decided to guard his own secrets about it in France with spiders there too.   Sully adopts Nate because he sees that this kid hasn't had any takers yet, Nate's not exactly the type of kid who would grow up doing well behaviorally in school, sees himself in the kid, and that Sully actually saw the chance to finally have a son after he thought he was too old to.    I'd agree the Syrian chapters weren't exactly eye-popping, but then again night-time/dark isn't where Uncharted really shines in any of its games.  I understand why many prefer Uncharted 2 to Uncharted 3, and I recognize that more people have that preference. I just personally think Uncharted 3 is better, not by much, but both are my two favorite games that I pretty much consider two parts of the same piece."
uncharted,1quulz,Superpicturexxx,3,Tue Nov 19 21:57:07 2013 UTC,"I remember someone saying that didn't like how the magic went unexplained. I remember thinking, that's why it's magic! And yeah Uncharted III went all out with the insaneness. I like it. I am replaying it now and I was thinking how this is the most action movie of them all. And they all have there moments where you have suspend your belief to the extreme, but it's all possible cause it's Nate of course, however Uncharted III is over the top but in a good way. In a way that was coming if that makes sense? Meaning that bigger, more epic set pieces were coming cause of the incredible work from Naughty Dog"

It's a cross-based code, sometimes attributed to the Knights Templar. I'm not sure what the inverted-V is, but so far I've translated it as ?E?ELSM ?MPI. The skull that appears at the end has latin written around it, which translates to ""Today you will be with me in paradise,"" the words of Jesus to one of the two thieves who were also crucified on Golgotha (Place of the Skull). In addition, the scratch marks that appear on the skull seem to symbolize three crosses, again connected to the crucifixion.

uncharted,1qo474,zackmanze,14,Fri Nov 15 06:05:01 2013 UTC,"""You left me rotting in that hellhole for 15 years."" My guess is that Nate ditched one of his old partners on an old adventure, and now he's pretty pissed off about it."
uncharted,1qo474,SolidFlyTrap,6,Fri Nov 15 04:29:10 2013 UTC,"I think a younger Nate was on a job with the narrator and they kept clashing and at the end of that adventure, the narrator was trapped and Nate saved himself instead of helping. Nate regretted this decision and is still trying to save him in a sense. He tries saving Eddie Raja and the woman in U3 although they clashed.  I think the narrator has caught up with Drake, kidnapped him and is forcing to help him rediscover what they tried finding all them years ago. Nate being forced to go treasure hunting would be some fresh story telling for the franchise."
uncharted,1qo474,EDoftheDEAD,7,Fri Nov 15 17:15:51 2013 UTC,"That actually makes a lot of sense. In the cases of Eddy and Marlowe, Nate had almost no reason to try and help them out. Maybe he immensely regrets his decision in not helping the narrator, and he's trying to make up for it?"
uncharted,1qo474,SolidFlyTrap,3,Fri Nov 15 22:03:22 2013 UTC,Yeah. I really think this is all about Drakes past catching up with him in some really bad ways.

uncharted,1qo474,Linken90,5,Fri Nov 15 04:54:13 2013 UTC,If you watch the trailer it goes around the Cape of Good Hope and towards Madagascar. It then circles the Isle Saint-Marie. That is where either the gameplay or background story takes place.

uncharted,1qo474,Hellotoyouplease,4,Fri Nov 15 07:08:58 2013 UTC,"It will be PS4 exclusive because they are going to want to make full use of the new hardware, doing things not possible on PS3.

uncharted,1qo474,SMKM,0,Fri Nov 15 15:42:28 2013 UTC,"Since we all know Drake isn't Drake i wonder if the voice in the video is in fact the real Drake and this is how he got screwed, or this is Naughty Dog just rebooting the series with a different character and there is no Drake :("
uncharted,1qo474,SolidFlyTrap,-13,Tue Nov 26 08:46:16 2013 UTC,"I didn't see any number 4. Likely a reboot a la Tomb Raider.  Edit: Holy shit, it's like I said that Naughty Dog stinks. Go on, downvote. I still think we won't play as Nathan. It'll probably involve Francis Drake. No U4."
uncharted,1qo474,SMKM,7,Fri Nov 15 04:23:33 2013 UTC,"They just don't want to reveal too much. I HIGHLY doubt they would do an Uncharted without Drake. I doubt they'd reboot a game series after THREE Game of the year wins for a series (3/3), and it just doesn't make sense. The trailer was ambiguous enough to leave us guessing what's up. Eventually the actual trailer whenever it is shown will probably reveal the 4 and subtitle, and then the subtitle will probably leave us guessing more things. Or it'll be like ""Among Thieves"" and leave us with nothing to guess over."
uncharted,1qo474,SolidFlyTrap,2,Fri Nov 15 04:30:46 2013 UTC,My bet is they'll reveal more at the VGAs.

uncharted,1qo474,SolidFlyTrap,2,Fri Nov 15 05:05:56 2013 UTC,"Even Uncharted 1 (which I've been playing tonight) still somewhat stands up nicely. Obviously not as much, but the water effects are super nice. Uncharted 1 was water, 2 was snow, 3 was sand, 4 ???"

It sucks I'll never get 100% in 2 or 3 though lol and based on rumors about ND making a space game....maybe this Uncharted will involve space somehow?"

Most likely this will be a simple revenge plot (MAYBE someone important to Drake will die?) and I'm going to assume the supernatural will yet again be important. Although this one seems to imply the knights templar so it may also be religious based. Who knows? I just want this game as soon as possible, hope it's amazing BUT I really really hope the online is better than 3's. If it went back to 2's online but improved I'd play the ever loving shit out of it."

I read some interesting comment somewhere, may have been YouTube, but it detailed how the person talking in the trailer could be someone that sully screwed over somehow, which would make sense, knowing Sully. Who knows."
uncharted,1qo474,D_Ciaran,1 point,Fri Nov 15 05:56:22 2013 UTC,"Don't get me wrong. I like Uncharted 3's multiplayer, just recently started playing it again, but I noticed I've yet to surpass 24 hours played whereas in Uncharted 2 I KNOW I passed that by far. I don't know, Uncharted 2 was just so damn perfect, and Uncharted 3 was just so broken to me and highly unbalanced. My kdr in Uncharted 2 was impressive I thought and in Uncharted 3 I died like at least twice as much which disappointed me. I wouldn't say I'm the ""best"" player, but coming off of games where I'd go 15-1, 14-2 etc and started playing games in U3 as 10-6, 9-7 etc, it just made no sense to me because the gameplay was largely unchanged. It was just all the blindfiring and bs accuracy of some guns, all the perks, etc. I just hope they get rid of the things that seemed to make U3 unbalanced, but more than likely they'll just add onto U3 and tweak U4 a bit. To me, Uncharted 3 was Gears of War 2. All they had to do was improve the initial multiplayer....instead it was a shit storm. So maybe Uncharted 4 will be like Gears 3? Playable, much better, but still no U2/Gears1? and assuming it follows this path I won't want an Uncharted 5 lol"

uncharted,1qo6rb,DarthDarthBinks,8,Fri Nov 15 04:52:16 2013 UTC,"Looks to be taking place in Africa (Cape of Good Hope; Madagascar).   Very cool.   Hopefully they give a good reason for Nate to jump back into treasure hunting--seeing as he's given it up now. But this sounds like the antagonist who'll make the first move, so it sounds like Nate will be dragged back into the adventuring life.   Ugh, cannot wait!    EDIT: Pasting my deduction from the r/gaming post  ""Well by that map it looks like a good portion of it takes place in Africa (Cape of Good Hope; Madagascar). Also seeing as Nathan ""Drake"" gave up his life of adventuring and treasure hunting at the end of Uncharted 3 and the malevolent tone of the narrator in the video, the speaker in this teaser is likely a past antagonist from Nate's history (outside of the previous 4 games) who will most likely force Nathan back into a quest in some sort of nefarious way.  Also, back during the Last of Us development, there were a few videos that showed some of Naught Dog's monitors having pirate concept art (classic swash-buckling pirates--not the modern day ones like Eddy Raja and Ramses), so the historic mystery/treasure will be tied to pirates. Reinforced by that skull and crossbones at the end of the teaser.  I think that is a pretty safe deduction."""
uncharted,1qo6rb,Captain_Sugar,2,Fri Nov 15 04:59:47 2013 UTC,"If you are right about the pirates, I am so excited. Excellent redditing my friend. An upvote for you!"
uncharted,1qo6rb,kacboy,3,Fri Nov 15 05:46:19 2013 UTC,Added a new comment. Definitely pointing to pirates.
uncharted,1qo6rb,Lupara,6,Fri Nov 15 05:58:04 2013 UTC,"Gathering information from the r/Games thread:  ""The person narrating [or, most likely, the person narrating is quoting] appears to be Robert Drury, an English sailor who was shipwrecked and lived as a slave for 15 years off the coast of Madascar in the early 1700's. This would fit with his statements about being trapped for fifteen years, and the map showed a journey of some kind to Madascar. The only thing that doesn't fit is what he said about being buried alive, but this could just be a metaphor.  ""Well, that certainly had a lot of clues in it... - Ãle Sainte-Marie was an infamous hideout for pirates in the 17th and 18th centuries - ""For God and Liberty"" was the motto of the semi-mythical pirate colony of Libertatia, which just so happened to (allegedly) have been on Ãle Sainte-Marie - ""Every betrayed us all"" refers to Henry Every, a British pirate was for at least a while based out of Ãle Sainte-Marie - Every's prize capture was the Ganj-i-sawai with several hundred thousand pounds (in the late 1600s) worth of loot, after paying off his crew with Â£1000 apiece near Madagascar, he and the rest of the loot vanished off the face of the Earth, never to be seen again. - ""Hodie mecum eris in paradiso"" translates to ""Today you will be with me in paradise"", and was allegedly spoken by Jesus to one of his fellow condemned who had converted while on the cross (Luke 23:43) - Not sure how this ties into it, aside from the obvious religious connotations of the motto...    Looks like Uncharted 4's historical figure will be Robert Drury, the the treasure will be the Ganj-i-sawai, and the 'lost city' will be the semi-mythical pirate colony of Libertatia.   The narrator is probably the antagonist, who will most likely force Nate into the adventure (seeing as he gave up that life at the end of Drake's Deception)."
uncharted,1qo95t,Chap82,2,Fri Nov 15 05:25:03 2013 UTC,"No, ""mecum"" is ""me"" (me) and ""cum"" (with) combined. So the correct translation would be, ""Today you are in paradise with me.""  Source: Have been taking Latin for four years."
uncharted,1qo95t,Stranger_of_Cydonia,3,Sat Nov 16 18:17:21 2013 UTC,"It's a quote by Jesus of Nazareth while he was on the cross, said to one of two thieves also being crucified when the thief repented of his sins.  The crucifixion took place on Golgotha (Place of the Skull), and in the video three scratch marks appear on the skull, symbolising the three crosses."
uncharted,1qo95t,OftenItalic,2,Fri Nov 15 05:31:52 2013 UTC,"So this likely means a character is returning from the dead which fits well with the being left for dead for 15 years stuff in the voice over. I didn't immediately recognise the voice so maybe a new character? I can't think of anyone it could be immediately though obviously Drake has left a lot of people for dead over the years, just none of them with that kind of voice I can think of..."

uncharted,1qo95t,OftenItalic,1 point,Fri Nov 15 06:29:29 2013 UTC,"I don't mean literal returning from the dead per se, I think it's more someone that we assume is dead returning. That being said I would be interested to see them look at some judeo-christian religious mythology. Obviously it would need to be balanced to avoid offending but it was interesting and quite well done in Indiana Jones so it could be good here too."
uncharted,1qo95t,DAPhammer,1 point,Sat Nov 16 15:32:29 2013 UTC,"Thank you for bringing where the quote come from to light... any idea about the ""Mecvm"" part?"
uncharted,1qo95t,Stranger_of_Cydonia,2,Fri Nov 15 11:53:34 2013 UTC,"From the Spanish Prepositions Wikipedia page.   ""Con, derives from the Latin CVM (âwithâ), is an idiosyncratic preposition that combines with the personal pronouns mÃ­, ti, and sÃ­ as the forms: conmigo (âwith meâ), contigo (âwith youâ), and consigo (âwith her-, himselfâ). Linguistically, the denotation of the -go suffix originally was inherent to con, that is â in Latin, CVM was often placed after its pronoun, thus the MECVM, TECVM, SECVM, et cetera, usages.""  If CVM means ""with"" then MECVM means ""with me.""   The phrase that Jesus tells the criminal being crucified with him is ""Today you will be with me in Paradise.""

This is not a direct confirmation. I still believe a 4th Uncharted will be made regardless of rumors. Its too popular. If they do a 4th one, I think they should do a prequel or go back to a simpler story.  The third uncharted had a muddied plot. Something close to the first uncharted where it was more of a true survivalist (Drake against everyone) would be a nice way to go.   Another idea I think would be cool if Drake was hired by the government or something or he is discovered by the media and some controversy appears from that. Or they can make a game where he searches for his keys in his couch cushions."
uncharted,1q3rt5,enforcetheworld,10,Thu Nov 7 15:23:22 2013 UTC,"I'm not feeling the idea of a prequel; there's no point in advancing the characters with prequels. We already know how Nate met everyone essentially, and I'd be more interested in seeing how his life is now.   Maybe he's settled with Elena and she just discovers she's pregnant, and living stateside. Maybe something happens close to home and instead of looking for treasure he ends up having to search for someone?   No matter what it is of course, I'll be buying it straightaway."
uncharted,1q3rt5,Kiwi_Force,1 point,Thu Nov 7 16:58:26 2013 UTC,"Whatever is amiss in Uncharted 4, it has to be something that forces Nate reluctantly back into the adventuring. Uncharted 3 nicely tied up that he was done with his treasure-hunting, shooting life.   I know the comparison may make some people uneasy, but it would be like Indiana Jones: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, where Indy was dragged back into matters by having to save Marion and then participates in the actual quest as the stakes are heightened by the antagonist.   Plus, we already have a ""prequel"" in Uncharted: Golden Abyss; or at least an adventure that takes place several years before Drake's Fortune."
uncharted,1q3rt5,Kiwi_Force,1 point,Thu Nov 14 09:37:07 2013 UTC,"Please god no. I don't want him to be hired by the government. They need to just stick to good old fashioned treasure hunting, I'm not against political stuff like how there were Nazis in Indiana Jones (I guess he was sort of working for the government there) but I just think Uncharted is at its best when Sully and Drake are out for gold and nothing more, yes they may discover more along the way but I prefer it if it starts with just a treasure hunt."
uncharted,1q3rt5,white_water,1 point,Fri Nov 8 06:03:38 2013 UTC,"I just think Uncharted is at its best when Sully and Drake are out for gold and nothing more   Which is why I'm starting to think that Uncharted 1 could have the best plot from all three games. This isn't to say that 2 was bad. I think 2 is better than U1. It manages to pull off the globetrotting plot better than 3 did. But I'm just trying to make a point that U1's plot was quite good. U1 is heralded as being the weakest of the series, but that's mostly game play related (bullet sponge enemies, too many enemies, etc). Story-wise, the main thing most people didn't seem to like was the zombies at the end. Personally, I didn't mind it too much, but I sympathize with everyone else. Besides, the game play hang ups, the basic story was very engaging because you did not know what was around the corner. You start off trying to find the treasure, but things go bad when Sully gets shot (captured). After the plane crash, the game turns into a survival adventure and your just trying to find Elena and hopefully Sully. At this point, there really is no story. Your just trying to regroup. So there was a strong sense of adventure. Also, everything was much more centralized and focused because of the proximity and isolation of the island. The motives were simple (survive, find elena) but they made sense. You really felt lost and caught up in the moment. Any information about where the plot was going was revealed in real time as you encountered new situations. The simpleness of it was very effective.  Of course, U1 didn't have all the bells and whistles that 2 and 3 did. And people who played 1 after 2 were let down which is understandable. But 1 has to be analyzed in the context of when it came out. It was really good despite its flaws. Also, I think the best parts of U3 were the parts that resembled 1. Specifically, the ship yard scene was classic Uncharted. It was just Drake against the odds trying to save Sully. But U1's plot and location really helped create the perfect atmosphere. U3 had many locations, but it whisks the player around too quickly. There is almost no time to soak in the surroundings. U3 also basically tells you everything that's going to happen. There was no sense of discovery."

uncharted,1pyayt,Melyanna,2,Wed Nov 6 17:01:28 2013 UTC,That gave me goose bumps. The feeling of adventure and the high stakes that Nate faces throughout the series were completely captured. Only suggestion I would make would be use nates theme somewhere in there.

uncharted,1prmyo,ZaphodbBrox,3,Sat Nov 2 22:00:23 2013 UTC,"Just started playing it again to celebrate it's 2 year anniversary. I was surprised to find I hadn't even played the online a full 24 hours yet. Guess I loved Uncharted 2. That and I still feel like the game became so unbalanced, but I still am enjoying it ever the same."
uncharted,1prmyo,SMKM,5,Sat Nov 2 23:42:44 2013 UTC,Yeah IMO there is almost no way to have decent balance in a game with custom classes that has most guns as unlockables. UC3 was a MASSIVE downgrade in terms of MP.
uncharted,1prmyo,Darksteelone,2,Sun Nov 3 02:42:38 2013 UTC,Not only that but those downloadable outfits that give you perks as well. Its just insane. I love the game don't get me wrong. I just wish it were more like uncharted 2.
uncharted,1prmyo,SMKM,2,Sun Nov 3 04:49:19 2013 UTC,Oh my god the micro transactions in UC3 are absurd. I remember getting one of the hats that effects your stats from treasures after weeks of playing with the one perk that made treasure more common (It was level 3 too) and then finding out it was a pretty useless hat. The worst part was when they released classical mode and got my hopes up. I tried it and immediately realized that the maps in UC3 sucked in terms of balance.

uncharted,1prmyo,SMKM,1 point,Sun Nov 3 17:25:06 2013 UTC,"lol, UC2 was a similar story, but then when the PSN went down, I was left with no other choice but to play the singleplayer, so yea I beat that. Will play UC3 one of these days, haha"
uncharted,1prmyo,stash0606,2,Sun Nov 3 20:06:44 2013 UTC,I can't believe it but I've found someone who primarily bought the uncharted games for multiplayer and not the single player lol wanna play sometime? I could always use some new U3 buds

Although I do want to go back and give it a shot, since they released all their maps for free. I don't know when I'll do that though, I'm playing GTA 5 online right now, I have Splinter Cell Blacklist to beat, I would like to get a platinum in Hitman Absolution, and then there's The Ballad of Gay Tony which I have yet to start, lol... not to mention a full time job.

uncharted,1ppgbe,8bubbles8joe,3,Sat Nov 2 02:46:17 2013 UTC,"I do like the sniping spots in the corners...  While I'm sure it looks like I'm complaining, the fact that we're getting a new map after 2 years is making me completely ecstatic."
uncharted,1ppgbe,Pallavolo,2,Sat Nov 2 02:49:59 2013 UTC,The dry docks map is pretty cool. It's fun to go on the upper deck and just take out people that are below.

uncharted,1npgze,virtual-toast,1 point,Mon Oct 7 03:05:18 2013 UTC,Good to know I am not alone. Does your game freeze at a specific chapters or parts of a chapter?
uncharted,1npgze,virtual-toast,2,Mon Oct 7 05:44:30 2013 UTC,"I don't want to spoil the game for you if you haven't already played it, but there's a specific point towards the end of the game where it freezes every single time. I can turn the console off and on again and start from my last save point, and it works fine, but for some reason on the initial playthrough it always freezes at that one point."
uncharted,1npgze,Snowlex,1 point,Tue Oct 8 01:03:11 2013 UTC,That sounds similar to what I am experiencing. When you reboot are you able to get past that part or does it freeze again? If it freezes again that is what is happening with me now but since it is a specific part I think it is an issue with the disk.

uncharted,1li8az,soundofvictory,2,Sun Sep 1 06:40:38 2013 UTC,"Its interesting you mention this. I don't have a ps3 anymore. I wish I could play. Anyways, U3 multiplayer had a lot of new things, but it didn't feel too different from U2 despite how much work they said they put into it. I have not played either in so long I probably forgot the differences. U2 felt really tight. U3 was basically the same except more options I guess. None of them felt particulary ground breaking though. And the whole moving set pieces was a good idea, but it never felt as epic as it sounded. It was also laggy. Long live the simplicity of U2."
uncharted,1li8az,stevyjohny,2,Sun Sep 1 17:13:28 2013 UTC,"I thought U2 was just perfect. Sure, it didn't have all the bells and whistles, but that's what I loved about it. I still play it way more than U3 to this day."

uncharted,1li8az,Tegstar7,1 point,Tue Sep 3 15:53:04 2013 UTC,As well as more health!!! Patch 1.05 was the reason so many people left. It was even risky climbing a ladder/ledge.
uncharted,1li8az,TunaFishy-,1 point,Sat Sep 14 12:04:39 2013 UTC,Really? I feel health is almost too much in U3. I get 4 headshots and the guy doesn't die? Wtf?? I'm having a TON of fun with the multiplayer even though I'm pretty late to the game in getting it. I purchased the max level pack and I'm thinking of getting the DLC but does anyone play those levels? I'm thinking not too many people since only the core levels are F2P. Also $20 is a lot to blow on some new levels.
uncharted,1li8az,SatansFist,1 point,Sat Sep 14 23:23:08 2013 UTC,"Well here's the thing. Uncharted MP level design isn't as flat as other games. Meaning there are multiple layers to explore. This was to keep the ""adventurous"" kind of element in the MP gameplay. Now after the health drop with the 1.05 patch in U2, It made it really risky to climb ladders/ledges. Which goes against the kind of gameplay the developers intended. With that extra health you can remain mobile and active instead of getting that greyish effect when heavily injured after 3 hits.   Yeah sometimes it's ridiculous on how many times you gotta hit someone especially with how laggy the game is, But I would rather deal with that instead of waiting behind cover for 10 seconds after just poking my head out for 2 seconds to regenerate health."

uncharted,1lgq1r,Friti,1 point,Sat Aug 31 15:17:36 2013 UTC,"The father and son thing is probably about the relationship between Sully and Drake. And if they're talking about characters, they are talking about more character than the main 6.   The main characters will probably be:   Drake Elena Chloe Sully   But there way more characters in the Uncharted-universe: Charlie, Flynn, a lot of bad guys, etc.  I think the movie has a lot of potential; there are already great relationships between a lot of characters, but big parts of Drakes life is still unknow. The movie could fill that hole. I also think that the movie has a bigger target than a lot of other game adaptions. they will probably make it like Indiana Jones mixed with a little bit more action."
uncharted,1lgq1r,Rocr,1 point,Sun Sep 1 17:06:41 2013 UTC,"Well the game basically is a movie. So it should be the easiest to implement. That being said, I have no faith in hollywood. This guy sounds somewhat promising even though I have never heard of him. I think its going to take someone who understands the franchise (and played the games) in order to make a successful movie. Too many people in hollywood don't understand video games. Hopefully, this is changing because of the flops from Hitman and the last Tomb Raider movie. Maybe they realized they can't just rely on the brand name in order to make a successful movie. They will need someone who understands the Franchise and can maintain the integrity of the characters because I think the movie adaptions will inevitably have to change some aspects of the story. Some sections of the games (at least U1) have to be cut out. For time alone, they have to. But they need someone who can do this without messing up the characters while still getting the basics right at least. And if they can't find someone to do that, they should just never make the movie."

uncharted,1jlke4,HeartOverHead,3,Sat Aug 3 00:15:20 2013 UTC,I'd suggest playing Uncharted 1 first. Only because Uncharted 3 had a few references to the first game.

uncharted,1jlke4,ookaami,2,Tue Aug 20 03:37:44 2013 UTC,"If I remember correctly, there were  3.   There wasn't a lot. But it was enjoyable when you notice."
uncharted,1jlke4,Shanbo88,3,Wed Aug 21 01:18:55 2013 UTC,"UC1 first. You'll catch any references from 1 that are in 3 and you won't feel the loss of any gameplay mechanics or how the game isn't quite as cinematic as 3. Definitely 1, then 3."
uncharted,1jlke4,virtual-toast,3,Sun Aug 4 13:28:16 2013 UTC,Go Uncharted 1 first. Uncharted 3 is meant to be played last and its themes are a commentary of Nate's character in the first two.
uncharted,1jlke4,sdesaulniers,2,Sun Aug 4 16:47:10 2013 UTC,Always play from the start. Go back to UC1.
uncharted,1jlke4,MomentOfGlory,2,Mon Aug 5 01:29:13 2013 UTC,"UC1. Uncharted is kind of like Nolan's Batman trilogy. Uncharted 2 stands on its own, but UC3 is definitely a sequel to UC1 and you'll miss out on things in UC3 if you haven't played UC1."
uncharted,1jlke4,stevyjohny,1 point,Mon Aug 19 06:17:39 2013 UTC,"UC1 isn't anywhere near as great as the others, so I'd go with UC1 first (so you know you've got a better game coming up)."

I know they are self contained stories, but the characters don't stay the same. Its like watching the last crusade before raiders of the lost ark. You can do it. Its just not meant to be that way.   You already played it out of order, but I would recommend playing the first one next. Unfortunately, you will have to get through some difficult sections. By now your probably familiar with some of the complaints about UC1 (bullet sponge enemies, waves of enemies at later sections). This was almost fixed in U2. There were a few spots in U2, if I remember correctly, these things still happened, but they were few compared to the first game. Despite all of this, I would still suggest playing the first one next."

uncharted,1j6rfe,TheAceMan,2,Sat Jul 27 23:30:39 2013 UTC,"Is the U3 co-op worth buying?   Yes, co-op adventure and arena are worth getting. Hunter arena and shade survival are okay.    What is the difference between them?   -Adventure is similar to the story mode, but with a different scenario for each chapter. They are unrelated to UC3's story. -Arena is 10 rounds with 3 revolving objectives.  -Hunter Arena is similar to Arena but the enemies are also players. And the objective is mostly to capture treasures.  -Shade Arena is similar to Arena. But the enemies are the djinn. Also, there are 8 rounds instead of 10.    Also, what is the best way to buy?   You should just buy the DLC from the PS store. You already have UC3's story and competitive multiplayer."

uncharted,1ihh94,fuckclaw,2,Thu Jul 18 13:36:44 2013 UTC,"I dunno of this is really advice, but I find if you try and go backwards in the series, the other games will seem technologically inferior. I played 2 (my favorite) then 3 and now 1, and it's really hard to get immersed when I have to compare the 6 year old game to its 1 year old counterpart. That's not saying its not still a great game though.  I guess just try and play them in order if you can, but it's not a huge deal if you don't."

uncharted,1icgda,SinsToJudge,5,Mon Jul 15 15:55:42 2013 UTC,Make it so I do not have to drive the jet ski AND shoot at the same time. Worst level from all 3 games in my opinion.
uncharted,1icgda,graphicspro,2,Tue Jul 16 20:07:09 2013 UTC,"took the words right out of my mouth. Also, they should have made it so it was more of a race or something, or another chase scene. That level was no fun because you had to stop all the time, even if they let you shoot and drive it still would have been a difficult area to maneuver in."
uncharted,1icgda,stevyjohny,3,Thu Aug 15 06:23:43 2013 UTC,"At the end of the game when you hop onto the El Dorado idol wrapped in cargo gear: make that playable. Nate is swinging around on the statue, he has a pistol. Maybe there would be one or two more helicopters flying nearby as well, each with a mercenary or two firing their guns at you. You would have to crawl around the idol for cover, and then pop of rounds at the attackers/pilots to down them. Elena still kicks that one guy and your chopper goes down too.   I definitely could have seen some more cinematic flair during the car chase; maybe some of that leaping from truck to truck and doing a bit of fighting in the car beds. Maybe even hop onto an ATV for a moment.   The plane crash itself would have made for a fun interactive moment; you having to grab a few items before leaping out as the turbulence rocks the aircraft back and forth.   The little scuffle between Nate and Navarro would have been more like the Talbot/Nate fight at the end of Uncharted 3--as well as the entire melee system being reworked to match it for all hand-to-hand."
uncharted,1icgda,stevyjohny,2,Mon Jul 15 17:44:57 2013 UTC,That would make a great excuse to do a remake of the first one. None of those changes would affect the story.
uncharted,1icgda,virtual-toast,2,Thu Aug 15 06:27:40 2013 UTC,The one thing that shits me up the wall when I go back and play 1 and 2 is the inability to throw grenades back.
uncharted,1icgda,MomentOfGlory,2,Fri Jul 26 07:58:09 2013 UTC,"Minor, but I think there are either too few checkpoints (during enemy ""waves"") or too many enemies. UC2 & 3 fixed this."
uncharted,1icgda,stevyjohny,2,Mon Aug 12 18:21:53 2013 UTC,"My biggest complaints have already been expressed by others here. I don't have any more set pieces to add. I would say I wish they explained the circumstances of the beginning scene more. According to the Uncharted Wiki, Elena uses a private investigator to find Drake because of his reputation for finding relics. It would be great if they had went into that a little more."
uncharted,1i45dv,marinojesse,5,Thu Jul 11 22:54:44 2013 UTC,"That is really great looking, much better than the original one in my opinion!"

uncharted,1i1j8v,Fr0st_Byte,5,Wed Jul 10 23:13:39 2013 UTC,I don't think so. Although the weapons trophies are fairly easy of you use the weapon spawn in the menu.  Source: I platniumed it.
uncharted,1i1j8v,Mr_chao,1 point,Wed Jul 10 23:47:02 2013 UTC,"You are correct.  After completing the game (at least) two times (crushing and another difficulty), you should have unlocked a lot of the weapon trophies already.   For the other weapons, play the chapter were Tenzins Village is under attack. IIRC, there is a spawn point that spawns unlimited enemies. It should be around that turret (at the beginning of the chapter).  I'm sure you can find it somewhere on YouTube.   Just use the single player store to get the weapons you need!"

uncharted,1hqq0h,4BM1,10,Sat Jul 6 09:20:49 2013 UTC,"Money, my dear boy, money.   Naughty Dog has become a name associated with an immense amount of success, based on the quality of their work. Nathan Drake has become a license to print money for them, so I don't see them stopping until the Drake Train finally loses it's steam. The fact that they shelved the series to do The Last of Us tells us a few things. First, that they know their games are good enough to stand on their own wihout a franchise to back them. Second, their focus is quality, regardless of the project. Third, they love to give fans what they want, and kick ass at it. Fourth, all the nods to Uncharted in TLOU tell us they know that it's Drake that lets them have the freedom to pursue other projects wihout the folks bankrolling them freaking out and micromanaging.   I admit to being a fanboy, yes. I'm wearing my Nathan Drake lucky horseshoe belt buckle (the one that came with the CE of uncharted 3) as I type this. I'd be ecstatic to see uncharted 4. But if it never comes to be, I won't be sad, because I know that means something just as good is happening. And that's enough for me."

The fact that they don't crank one out every year lends to the quality. I love Assassins Creed, but you can definitely feel the rush of their production schedule. Give me a slower release schedule with a polished product over battle of honor: modern whatever. I guaruntee its worth the wait."
uncharted,1hqq0h,SEAtactics,2,Sat Jul 6 14:46:34 2013 UTC,"I think they will do another TLoU. It makes more sense because TLoU was VERY sucsessful in a short amount of time.

uncharted,1hqq0h,QuadraQ,1 point,Sun Jul 28 05:16:24 2013 UTC,Don't forget that Sony owns the IP so they can have one of their other studios do Uncharted 4 instead of Naughty Dog.
uncharted,1hqq0h,stevyjohny,1 point,Tue Jul 9 18:55:54 2013 UTC,"I have always believed they would make at least one more. It's still wildly popular. The Last of Us was not a sign of a permanent shift from Uncharted. After Uncharted 2, Naughty Dog split their team into two groups. I believe they even relocated buildings. I think its apparent that one of these groups was working on the Last of Us while the other one did Uncharted 3. It would explain why Uncharted 3 was an almost universal setback, according to the majority of gamers. They had decided even before U2 (these things are planned ahead) of taking a quick break from Uncharted.  Besides these reasons, I would just go back to the popularity of the series. Three just doesn't feel like enough. There may not be 5, but I'm convinced there will be a 4th at some point. Of course, I have no evidence, but its about the money man, unless NaughtyDog really is sick of Uncharted and they won't admit to it."
uncharted,1hqq0h,ChicagoBulls1984,1 point,Thu Aug 15 06:37:30 2013 UTC,"Yeah. It only seems logical for another Uncharted to be made. The name sells.

uncharted,1hqq0h,HUmarWhitill,1 point,Sat Sep 7 19:09:33 2013 UTC,"There will be a Naughty Dog game at (/close after) PS4-launch!  Naughty Dog has two teams of developers. One was making Uncharted 3, the other was creating The Last of Us.Â¹ After the launch of Uncharted 3 the first team continued contributing the Uncharted 3 (Block Mesh Maps, etc). However, after a while they moved on (somewhere in the end of 2012).   From that point on all patches and DLC were developed by a two-man teamÂ² (!). This means that the rest of the team is working on another project which will probably launch at the PS4-launch.   That being said; Sony owns Naughty Dog and wants to have the best possible set of launch titles, consisting of a few new IP's (Driveclub) and some old ones (such as Killzone and Infamous). Those old ones are massive franchises and are perfect to attract new customers. Leaving out an even bigger franchise as Uncharted doesn't make sense when you want to win this generations console war... I don't believe that Sony would decide to abandom a multi-million units-selling franchise to gamble with a new franchise... Of course, all Naughty Dogs games will sell a lot, but why would you take risks... Uncharted 4 will - without a doubt - sell millions of copy's    Â¹. The team that developed The Last of Us probably also developed Uncharted 2. Neil Druckmann was creative director on both titles.  Â².

uncharted,1hqq0h,ohnoesazombie,0,Sat Jul 6 12:59:17 2013 UTC,Personally I hope there isnt another Uncharted just so Naughty can move on to another franchise (maybe pirate themed) but yea I am sure there will be another Uncharted because if you can legally print money why wouldnt you.  If/when they do another Uncharted I hope that they so something different than the first 3 with either a younger or older Drake

uncharted,1hb3h6,supergregx2,4,Sat Jun 29 16:59:40 2013 UTC,maybe a few years ago he would have been a contender but he's 77 and Sully does have a fair bit of physical activity to do. Plus if the film were to get made it would take a couple years to get it sorted and he could be 80 by the time production takes place and what about sequels??

He's got the look head to toe, and anyone who's watched the show knows that he's got the snark.  Part of me wants to cast Nathan Fillion as Sully, since he's clearly the best choice for Nate is now too old. However I think the obvious choice for Sully is Bruce Campbell, hands down. Fillion should still get a cameo somewhere, though.  The only person I can imagine as Elena is Emily Rose. Same thing for Cutter, I want Graham McTavish. I agree that Jason Statham would look the part but I hate him with a fiery burning passion.  I'm stuck on Chloe... maybe Yvonne Strahovski if they dye her hair?"

The Uncharted script would be easy to write. The first movie could be based off the first game. They could then fill in more backstory that the game(s) never had. Specifically, Elena using a private investigator to hunt down Nathan Drake and introducing the story that way. Then, they find the treasure on the ship. They get attacked. Sully rescues them. The plane gets shot down over the island (skipping the part where elena is ditched and somehow tracks them down). They all land on different parts of the island. And the story continues as normal with Drake getting captured by Eddie, being bailed out by Elena. Epic chase ensues. River Battle. Then they find sully again. Then the final push for El Dorado."

It combined cinematics and video games into one. That being said, if its so much like a movie already, it may not be necessary to do a movie. However, since it is so cinematic already, its the easiest game to make the jump. I only want the movie if there going to fill in some of the holes Naughty Dog never went into:   How exactly Nate and Elena met. What was Nate doing at that time? Was he easily lured into the El Dorado chase. How much was he paying? It would be interesting to see the aftermath of the incident when (or what) Elena tells her bosses about the misadventure.   However, the game should be Naughty Dog approved. I think Hennig should make sure it doesn't stray too far from the narrative of the characters."

It might as well have been Drake wearing a clown costume and flailing his arms while singing opera, for all I know.  Whatever I did, the game said ""Yyyup, that's a valid and logical action, so here's your checkpoint.""  I shrugged, fought through the remainder of the B&E part, and it didn't give grief after that.

uncharted,1gt8ou,DJ_Link,2,Fri Jun 21 19:11:01 2013 UTC,"Reasons why I think there will be an uncharted game on the Ps4:  1) Uncharted was much more successful than Crash, and Jak & Daxter. Crash, and Jak only lived within their respected generations.This might not be the case with Uncharted.   2) Uncharted 3 wasn't conclusive, meaning there is hope for U4's story.  3) The Last of Us has a ""making of"" video where 2 pirate like characters are spotted. This could indicate that U4 is a prequel with Drake (The explorer who was looking for Eldorado) being the main character, or it could just be a scene within U4.  4) The online component has huge potential on the Ps4. (sharing, better servers, etc)  5) Uncharted needs Ps4. Since it has to exceed The Last of Us from a technical stand point. The bar has been set pretty high with TLoU!  6) This might be far fetched, but Elena's actress (Emily Rose) was/is pregnant. Nolan North (Nate's actor) stated in an interview that she couldn't possibly use mo-cap for a while. In Uncharted 3 it seems that Elena and Nate might have a future together, possibly a kid. So being pregnant and putting on a mo cap suit isn't far fetched. Heck, it might even add to the realism!"

(This can be increased to two mods with the booster Weapon Expert; bronze will give you a second mod on pistols, gold on long guns)  The skinned guns (Lazaravic's KAL, Drakes AK, Sully's Dragon, etc) are guns that have multiple MODS (that fit the character the gun is named after). Those guns are unlocked when you complete a treasure set (just like the hats/skeleton skins). So you can pay for all guns to unlock them earlier, but you don't have to!   Some guns can only be bought; the promotional guns like the Comic Con-guns.   The last group of guns are some skinned guns that can only be unlocked in the tournament system (reaching bronze, silver, gold or platinum tier will unlock them the next week). Those guns ignore your level and have all mods unlocked. As a level 15 you could get a M9 with Rate of Fire in this way."
uncharted,1gkvpf,Rocr,2,Tue Jun 18 18:14:33 2013 UTC,The spyders m9 has special mods on it and the progo m9 has all the mods unlocked I believe. I might be wrong.
uncharted,1gkvpf,mkcoon13,2,Tue Jun 18 13:45:36 2013 UTC,"The Spyder M9 has 2 boosters on it, that can't be changed. The Progo M9 is probably unlocked by the tournament, and can only have one booster put on it. Treasure guns also look different than regular guns."

uncharted,1gbbil,Bruce_Wang,1 point,Fri Jun 14 03:18:45 2013 UTC,"Well it doesn't sound good. I know this is hindsight, but you probably should have just gotten the strange relic AFTER beating the game. If you indeed did save over your game, then you will need to restart. Either way, you'll be risking the trophy not popping if you continue on that game save."

Drakes Fortune, Among Thieves and Drakes Deception were all released earlier than Golden Abyss!  A few characters are in-game since the beginning of the series;   Drake Elena Sully   In the other games some new characters appear, of which most didn't appear in the next game(s) in the series. Chase appeared in Golden Abyss for the first time and could therefore not appear in the other three games. Of course I am not the developer, but the chance that Chase will return in Uncharted 4 is very small. Also because Golden Abyss isn't made by Naughty Dog."

Her chemistry with Drake isn't anything compared to Elena or Chloe, and her character isn't explored in nearly as much detail. She had potential, but ultimately she was written into the game for the sake of there being a girl in the game.   Also there's the fact she wasn't created by Amy Hennig or Naughty Dog."

You also have to take into account that this game has been out for a while - there are players who've clocked in 700+ hours and there's also been an influx of new players since the game went free to play recently. Since Free-to-play players have not likely bought DLC's, you'll likely to run into them if your DLC is turned off. And vice versa, you're more likely to run into pros if your DLC is turned on.   If you're traveling alone and you're at a max rank you'll be paired with the lesser ranks - I think the game has done its best to balanace players, but there will always be players who will exploit the system to their advantage."

uncharted,1f1jr7,stevyjohny,5,Sat May 25 19:51:36 2013 UTC,"naughty dog wrote in between the lines on this one. The best that anyone can come up with and the most logical conclusion is they got married after the second game and then separated (but not divorced). Of course, no one really knows. Its entirely possible they divorced, although unlikely because she still keeps the ring. Her excuse for wearing the ring is because she is in the middle east. The playful banter is their awkward way of getting over the past. Also, there is other dialogue that hint at their separation as she has grown weary of Nates lust for adventure.   However, I still had to check the wiki and other forums myself at the end. I was pretty sure they were married, but I wanted to see what other people thought. Amy Hennig is all about writing in between the lines with her characters. However, with U3, I wish she would have given us more concrete information not only with their relationship but also with other aspects of the story. I paid full price for the game and I want ANSWERS. Some mystery is ok. But I don't want to be on the forums for days analyzing theories about what a particular line really meant. Some of that is okay, but the entire U3 game was like that. I have no idea what happened. I like talking about it before the game is released because it makes the time go."

Uncharted 3 was structured pretty much the exact same as Uncharted 2, and the cutscenes never had any noticeable big-moments that broke immersion in either game. I found the same amount of easy flow in both installments.   Also, I wasn't the biggest fan of the Lazaravic boss-fight. Although the Talbot fight at the end should have been handled differently and better, kind of focusing on breaking all of his little illusions and tricks he had been using the entire journey, at least the battle utilized a new mechanic of the revamped melee system--and it had some pretty sick brawling choreography to boot. The Lazaravic battle was retread ground--running around in circles while emphasizing contextual explosive mechanics? Nothing new and much more lackluster.   For Uncharted 4's story they need to:    Give Nathan a worthy reason to go back on an adventure. Uncharted 3 sort of wrapped up the series, answering why Nate does what he does and how it is more harmful than helpful.  Have a boss fight that utilizes one or more new gaming mechanics while also holding a purpose in the narrative with some depth.  Boss fights are all about using what we have learnt over the course of the game's journey and putting it to the test against a significant adversary--it is not a bullet sponge who we just keep wearing down clip after clip. Also, the battle has to mean something to Nate. A lot of people give this film a ton of flack, but The Dark Knight Rises does this well. Batman returns to fight Bane not just to save Gotham, but to prove to himself that he has learnt/regain the morals he needed to be a better person and facing the masked brawler who broke him before is the ultimate/only test.    Lazaravic' boss fight did not come nearly close enough to this, being hardly more than, ""I need to stop this guy"" instead of emphasizing ""I need to protect and look out for others, even at the cost of sacrificing myself.""   Talbot's was not any better in this regard, because the ultimate character morality test was when Marlow sank in the sand--and the ensuing battle was Talbot attacking Nate instead. Pretty passive for a protagonist.   As for multiplayer, I think you hit all of the right points. I just think it should reflect the campaign a bit more--incorporate the new melee system yet simplified a little bit for PvP (chances for melee rebuttals instead of just rolling; more animations--not just gunbucks, actual punches), and keep it in its entirety for co-op. Destructible environments, not in the vain of Battlefield but in the vain of Uncharted: Drakes Fortune--a few clips deteriorates cover to the point where not every bullet can be blocked. And of course, incorporate a set-piece into every map without it being a ""pre-lude."""

uncharted,1du4cv,QuadraQ,6,Tue May 7 02:19:52 2013 UTC,"I would love to see a new Uncharted title but I do think the franchise needs a break of a few years at least. It makes perfect sense to release any sequel on the PS4, and with the new technology and a developer like ND who put as much love into the story and humour as much as the technical side, the series can only go from strength to strength as long as the franchise ends up diluted like Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed."
uncharted,1du4cv,LFCMick,3,Sun May 12 22:35:07 2013 UTC,"The issue as I see it is that Sony needs a marquee title to help sell the PS4 and show off what it can do. The Uncharted series fills this bill better than any of their exclusives I can think of. I'm not saying they have to make a whole new series of them right away, but the PS4 without at least one Uncharted title, just doesn't feel right."
uncharted,1du4cv,stevyjohny,2,Mon May 13 22:34:22 2013 UTC,yeah i agree. They said they like to create something new for each system but we all know that is rubbish. There is simply too much demand for U4 not to happen. No one loves jak and daxter the same as Uncharted. There has to be at least one more.
uncharted,1du4cv,heythisispaul,7,Sun May 26 16:39:18 2013 UTC,"Yeah I hate to burst some bubbles, but I find this completely unlikely. With Last of Us being a brand new IP still in the works, I don't think we'll hear of another Uncharted for a little while."
uncharted,1du4cv,joeshrimp11,2,Wed May 8 02:21:53 2013 UTC,":( This is one of the only downsides to the next generation in my opinion. Developers will have new tools to play with, and they'll decide to test it on other projects, instead of bringing favorites back. Don't get me wrong, I can't wait for The Last of Us, but I'd much rather have a new Uncharted because this series has brought a lot of joy to me for the past several years."
uncharted,1du4cv,SMKM,15,Mon May 13 20:44:44 2013 UTC,"You mean Unkarted?  But in all seriousness, I want to see something different. Uncharted is my favorite game franchise, but it needs a break. I hope they either reveal a new IP or bring back Crash or Jak."
uncharted,1du4cv,joeshrimp11,18,Tue May 7 02:27:07 2013 UTC,"Why reveal yet another IP when they just made the last of us? also they can never make another Crash game, they don't own crash anymore"
uncharted,1du4cv,JakeCampFire,7,Tue May 7 04:48:35 2013 UTC,It completely slipped my mind that they don't own him

uncharted,1du4cv,stevyjohny,-1,Tue May 7 04:52:00 2013 UTC,"Why do people find it funny to make an ""unkarted"" joke every single time the idea of a new uncharted game is discussed? It's not original or funny, it's just annoying."
uncharted,1du4cv,morphinapg,2,Tue May 7 14:34:40 2013 UTC,"I think that while a lot of the fans would be over the moon to see UC4, for the PS4 (including myself), there will be some other exclusive that will be ready for release date, if not shortly after. Possibly not even from Naughty Dog either as they appear to be dedicating their time to the Last of Us, but that could be a decoy. What I'm saying is I don't think another Uncharted is going to intrigue enough new customers to choose a PS4 rather than the XBOX, or whatever comes from the 'steam box' confusion."
uncharted,1du4cv,StricklyPro,2,Tue May 7 09:03:14 2013 UTC,"Although I would love to hear that it will be coming out with the PS4 launch, I'd rather it didn't. Gives Naughty Dog more time to figure out what to do with the story, character, multiplayer, etc. And more time to familiarize with the engines for PS4 to make the best game possible"
uncharted,1du4cv,LostInThisWorldx,4,Wed May 15 15:34:42 2013 UTC,First of all Naughty Dog has two teams and one of them has been working on something secret for more than two years - whatever it is there's almost a 100% chance it's a PS4 game. The kits for the PS4 have been available for years and we can be sure Naughty Dog has one. Secondly the PS4 was designed to be more developer friendly so this transition shouldn't be as jarring as the PS2 > PS3 transition was. Lastly it doesn't have to be a launch title - an announcement at E3 and an early 2014 release window would be enough.
uncharted,1du4cv,stevyjohny,1 point,Wed May 15 19:45:51 2013 UTC,"Well, the naughtydog team was split in half with UC3. A lot of the people that did U2 went to work on the last of us. They had a lot of new people working on U3 which is why I believe that game suffered. I would be worried if they were making another uncharted game with that same team as before."
uncharted,1du4cv,SMKM,1 point,Sun May 26 16:37:46 2013 UTC,"I'm fairly sure it will be announced. I don't think it will be a launch title, but it will likely release within a year of launch."

uncharted,1du4cv,ndiuncharted,1 point,Tue May 7 18:31:30 2013 UTC,"I think so, but I also am not sure if it will be any better than the PS3 version of UC4.

uncharted,1dg4fo,morphinapg,3,Wed May 1 05:26:38 2013 UTC,"I would definitely suggest Nolan North far more than Roday, I was just considering the possibilities if they couldn't get Nolan. I don't particularly think Jensen could play the character very well. I don't really like Nathan Fillion for Drake either. I think he could probably play the character very well, but he looks a bit too old for the character imo, and also not really the right body type either. I've heard a few other names tossed around. I don't like Mark Wahlberg for the role, but thankfully he dropped out of the project. Bradley Cooper might be able to pull it off. Gerard Butler isn't a horrible choice, he could probably play the character pretty well, but his voice wouldn't fit imo, even with an american accent. I don't like David Boreanaz. There's more I just can't think of any right now."
uncharted,1dg4fo,djSexPanther,1 point,Wed May 1 05:51:32 2013 UTC,One idea I've heard is Chris Pine. I think he could do it really well.

uncharted,1dg4fo,Captainobvious89,9,Wed May 1 00:43:55 2013 UTC,"Looks aside, Nathan Fillion practically is Nathan Drake."
uncharted,1dg4fo,winesti,5,Wed May 1 01:27:27 2013 UTC,The only difference between Malcolm Reynolds and Nathan Drake is Drake has a bit more carelessness.
uncharted,1dg4fo,Captainobvious89,5,Wed May 1 01:32:34 2013 UTC,"That's accurate. Plus, I feel like it took a few episodes for Mal to play the comedic aspect, and Drake is lighthearted in pretty much every situation. But at least you would know what to expect if Fillion were cast and it would be pretty solid."
uncharted,1dg4fo,amazingseiderman,5,Wed May 1 01:38:05 2013 UTC,"If photoshop is considered cheating, then so is using a 10-year-old photo.  Here's a picture of Jensen Ackles from People's Choice Awards 2013  Here's a picture of Nathan Fillion from the same event.

uncharted,1dexky,TheModernEgg,0,Wed May 1 11:54:11 2013 UTC,"How is this not everyone's only choice?  There's nobody that could be Drake/Sully except Nathan Fillion/Bruce Campbell.  MAYBE Nolan North, if only because he does resemble Drake and he does the voice already."
uncharted,1dexky,morphinapg,1 point,Tue Apr 30 22:46:51 2013 UTC,"I would want all the game actors if possible. Even Richard McGonagle, while he wouldn't look the same as Sully from the games, with proper costume and makeup he could look decent and of course his acting would be perfect for Sully, because he is Sully. Really it's the actors that make the characters, so I'd want them if at all possible. You have to have Emily Rose for Elena though, she already looks perfect for the role. Heck, I swear in one episode of Haven she was wearing the exact same outfit as Elena from Uncharted 2."
uncharted,1dexky,Plex0re,3,Tue Apr 30 23:21:28 2013 UTC,"I don't know, Roger's a bit on the skinny side to be Sully. And I associate him more with sitting proper in deep civilization instead of being adventurous in a jungle."

uncharted,1dexky,stash0606,7,Tue Apr 30 19:42:24 2013 UTC,I always thought of Emiliano Diez (acted in George Lopez Show) as perfect for Sullivan
uncharted,1dexky,artshowhero,4,Tue Apr 30 17:51:38 2013 UTC,"That's a good match, too!    And, if anyone watches John Slattery on Mad Men, it's not just because of his resemblance to Sully. I think a part of the character he plays (Roger Sterling) is a good match for Sully's personality: tough and debonair, yet vulnerable.  ALSO LOOK AT HOW HOT HE IS."
uncharted,1dexky,JakeCampFire,2,Tue Apr 30 20:54:37 2013 UTC,Yes! When I first played he's exactly who I thought of.

uncharted,1d14rc,JakeCampFire,1 point,Thu Apr 25 02:39:41 2013 UTC,"Dude, there are different treasures for every play mode. I guarantee if you play on anything else but the lab you will get things you haven't gotten yet."
uncharted,1d14rc,RageRedditor3,1 point,Wed Apr 24 22:30:30 2013 UTC,"Exactly, you have to play most, if not all of the modes to get the treasures. Also, Co-op is how you can unlock alot of treasures too."
uncharted,1d14rc,JakeCampFire,1 point,Thu Apr 25 01:53:22 2013 UTC,"yea I know, I'm trying to unlock some that are specific for TDM (which is what the lab is right now). I also played through some of the coop adventures on hard to try and collect some of the treasures which would unlock one of the skeleton skins. Also, I like the lab more than the regular playlist (which I suck at), hence why I'm sticking to the lab. My problem is with the randomness of it. I have treasure hunter equipped all the time, and they're still the same treasures."

Playing Uncharted 3, during the sandstorm part where the trucks are shooting at you, along with other random enemies.  It was pretty hectic, but I just pop out from and get a headshot on a dude nearly right away, and proceed to toss a grenade back and kill someone else.  It felt good."

There was really no way I could have turned that game around, but I was dead-set on not losing 50-0.  After bumbling around for a couple of minutes (these guys were really good) I pick up a dragon sniper rifle. Some guy walks by, and without thinking I make a shot. BOOM! Headshot. And seconds, there's a second headshot.  Lost that game 50-2, but those kills were ever so satisfying."

He got grenaded, I got his shotgun and spot. Then I watched him come back and try the same on me but he managed to grenade himself and I jumped out of the way.  He then tried to go round the other way which I figured out already so I waited round a corner and shotgunned him in the face.  The round ended just as that happened.

I felt like his prime target, too.  It became discouraging.  Then I became determined to beat him.    It was quite the challenge, but on the final game I played, I wound up beating him and winning the match. I just had an overall really nicely played match. And I humped the shit out of his dead body.  The rest of our friendship is history."

uncharted,1an6dd,Plex0re,2,Wed Mar 20 04:19:43 2013 UTC,Like in chain reaction they'll just sit in the zones so they capture them back and forth the entire time. The more captures you get the more money you get.   So they won't even try to take over the other zones. Lame.
uncharted,1an6dd,Rocr,1 point,Wed Mar 20 04:44:00 2013 UTC,"Are you talking about Uncharted 2 or 3?  In U2 it is indeed a problem. The medal 'Expensionist' gives you a lot of money and if you want to level up, it's the fastest way to do it.  In U3 it doesn't happen that much, because in the Team Objective matches, different Objectives are mixed: instead of only Chain Reaction, you play King of the Hill and Marked Man as well."

uncharted,1am2je,Rocr,8,Tue Mar 19 19:45:44 2013 UTC,"I would like to see the game begin from his life as a married man. Maybe him and Elena are moving in together and he is helping her out in the exploring department to get documentary footage. He is done with treasure hunting. Maybe Elena will get pregnant. Anyways, in the city where they live (no idea, just pulling this out of thin air), Sully shows up out of nowhere. He says, ""I know we said we were done"" or something. Drake is trying to get him out of there. But, somehow, the trouble finds them, because they believe that Drake is sitting on a fortune and want it for themselves. So you're forced into defense. In the cities, on the roofs, eventually in nature to stick with the theme of the game. One thing leads to another, he has to rescue his dream of a family for the first time in his life by rampaging through the forests and treasure hunting in the process. Bringing back Navarro would be cool. I'd love for them to revisit the themes brought up in U2 where Lazarrobitch brings up how Drake is just as much of a monster as he is, as he kills countless men in his endeavors. So this is a journey of self-redemption (so maybe more stealth? I personally hate stealth, but I know I am the minority), and fighting for something other than treasure.   I've obviously thought about this before."
uncharted,1am2je,uhleckseee,7,Wed Mar 20 03:43:13 2013 UTC,"I would love to see Nate get dragged back into his adventuring life somehow--since he gave it up at the end of 3. He has to still be with Elena at the beginning of Uncharted 4 also, they've played out that ""split up"" too much and solved that as well. I want to see more of his past girls that he saved flowers from in his Uncharted 2 journal (also, maybe even Marisa Chase from Golden Abyss), even if they're just humorous cameos in the vain of Pirates of the Caribbean whenever some random wench from his past slaps Jack Sparrow.   Uncharted 4's themes should be all about Life vs. Death. Bring up the fact that Nate kills a ton of people and he's sick of ending hundreds--if not thousands--of lives and wants to make some life instead (perhaps a child with Elena). Also, we're long overdue for a main/recurring character's death.   Whatever it takes, the next monsters should be dinosaurs. I want to see what Naughty Dog can do with next-gen tech and dinosaurs. Imagine if one setpiece was like the brontosaur-stampede in King Kong but instead of just running between their legs, you're shooting at other soldiers, fighting off raptors, climbing up the apatosaurs themselves and leaping from one to another.   Hell, can you even IMAGINE A BATTLE WITH A T-REX IN UNCHARTED? That sounds like the best thing ever.   We know that Naughty Dog can pull off the dinosaur look--just take a peak at the raptor head in the U3 Multiplayer.   Maybe to tie this all together: confront the fact that Nate has killed/kills a ton of people. He is sick of destroying lives and wants to make some (again, a child with Elena--possibly pregnant already). However he gets dragged back into this life (maybe a kidnapped ally) and the end result should be the Garden of Eden (fitting in with the reoccurring ""legendary lost city"" trope in the series, this is the place where life started--and why can dinosaurs not be there too? Plus, the goddamn flame-sworded cherubs would make cool guardian mini-bosses as well) and the Macguffin could be the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge (Nate is a hardcore book-worm and knowledge would appeal to him too). Nathan loses someone important on the way. Of course in the end he wins, refuses the Fruit, and leaves violence once and for all to go do something productive (raise family, be with friends, and maybe teach--just live).  Keep the same amount of globe trotting as Uncharted 3 so we get a nice variety of different environments to both explore and experience again in multiplayer. While the end result would probably be another revisit to the Mediterranean (which I would still love), I would also like to see some of Africa and Australia. A heavily populated large first-world city would be very cool too, with it being a mixture of a stealthy blend-in environment with a lot of fisticuffs moments peppered in.   Nathan Drake, Victor Sullivan, and Elena Fischer are musts. Chloe Frazier and Charlie Cutter, while not necessary, are also welcome.   Also, add in a second character to play as in the form of whatever explorer Nathan is trailing. Experience most, if not all, of the environments as him during flashbacks as Nathan reads the journal/memoirs/documents and then re-experience the same places again hundreds or thousands of years later in the present as Nate. Some pretty cool puzzles could come out of this idea.   TL;DR: Life vs. Death; Garden of Eden; Dinosaurs; Major Character Death; Lots of Globetrotting; Urban Action; Briefly Play as the Explorer"
uncharted,1am2je,HUmarWhitill,3,Wed Mar 20 00:58:10 2013 UTC,would love to see Nate get dragged back into his adventuring life somehow   maybe it is an older drake and there is a new adventurer that pulls him into a job because Drake has some information on something. This could tie up his story and move us to a new protagonist. Imagine if the major character death is Drake and from that point in the game you switch to the new character!?  The garden of eden could be a really cool place to visit with the biblical characters they could bring in. Not sure how I feel about dinosaurs though...
uncharted,1am2je,white_water,1 point,Wed Mar 20 03:24:11 2013 UTC,YES dinosaurs. They would fit the game perfectly.
uncharted,1am2je,Vlorence,3,Sun Jun 2 10:25:19 2013 UTC,"I would bring back Atoq Navarro somehow... Maybe he could have freed himself underwater or something like that. Than he could have been infected with the zombie-el-dorado-stuff. Now he is living as a pimp in Atlantis, that Drake and Sully are trying to find"
uncharted,1am2je,xcalibur866,3,Tue Mar 19 20:09:34 2013 UTC,"What we need is an ending to the series. Something that'll be so good, inspiring, and definitive that people wont even be left asking for more story. For this to happen, every main character needs to die. No survivors. No chance of reprisal. But also, they need to die for a good reason. No random, pointless deaths. It needs to be meaningful and emotional.  My favorite stories start at the end. I think the game begnning with Drake staring at all that he's lost before his final battle would be a great intro. Then cut to the real beginning of the game. Maybe even a mix similar to how Uncharted 2 began.   The next element that I think needs to be explored is real life. A real world problem like terrorism, drugs and addiction, cartel violence, war, genocide, etc. Drake has spent all his life adventurng in secluded places. In doing this, he's ignored all that's really going on in the world.  The next thing it needs, as in all Uncharted games, is something supernatural. For me, my pick would be time travel. I just personally love stories that are able to mix in reasons for past events with time travel. It'd also give ND a chance to have an origin story in there.  And then lastly, the game still needs that sense humor through it all. It needs to force us to find that laughter throughout it all.   I know it lacks specifics, but that's what I envision.  tl:dr everyone needs to die in the real world while time traveling and laughing."
uncharted,1am2je,HUmarWhitill,3,Wed Mar 20 02:01:07 2013 UTC,So you want U4 to be an episode of Dr. Who?
uncharted,1am2je,kacboy,2,Wed Mar 20 05:41:11 2013 UTC,No aliens!!!!! There is no way I want a crystal skull scenario!
uncharted,1am2je,HUmarWhitill,3,Wed Mar 20 06:01:02 2013 UTC,"I would like to see a younger Drake and Sully. Maybe not as the whole game back as a part. One of the cool things about U3 is that we find out how they met but that still leaves confusion as to everything that happened between that point and U1. It would be cool to have flashbacks to the point that they are always referencing in their dialogue. It would be cool to have a game that takes an episodic approach giving us bits and pieces of their lives leading up to U1 (though this would probably not be U4 but a ""spin off"" on the vita).   Do we still play with Drake? Which characters? Will some of them die? Which countries? What kind of enemies? What kind of treasure?   Now to actually talk about U4. I think we have to still play as Drake at least for the majority of the game. part of the games big thing is that, with the exception of co-op, you always are Drake exploring. As for characters I would like to see Drake and Elena together on a trip, maybe their honeymoon or a vacation, and they end up getting roped in to some mystery. I mentioned this in a comment in jade-e's post but I think it could be interesting to have Drake die, though that wouldnt happen if it was a honeymoon. Another cool idea could be Drake taking his and Elena's kids on a trip where Drake is a mentor figure similar to how Sully is to Drake."

uncharted,1am2je,HUmarWhitill,1 point,Sat Apr 6 02:14:18 2013 UTC,Right but the vita game doesn't really go into Nate and sully's relationship. I havent read/watched  any of the other things you mentioned but at the point in golden abyss Nathan and silly are already established as good friends. I want to see them fight and argue and disagree.

uncharted,1am2je,kacboy,2,Sat Apr 6 16:11:12 2013 UTC,"I'd like to see the game set around Irish Mythology, examples of possible treasure or lost city could be The Four Treasures of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann or TÃ­r na nÃg (""Land of the Young""), if there's going to be a supernatural enemy there could be the Banshee or the Sluagh.  Edit: Formatting."
uncharted,1am2je,Tobi_Addams,1 point,Sun May 12 22:14:49 2013 UTC,"I think it would be really cool to be in an urban environment. Drake has been adventuring around in jungles, deserts, mountains, and fighting all the time. What if he was in the middle of a shootout in New York? He would have to navigate a completely new environment and the people in it. Drake will kill bad guys, but I highly doubt he would shoot a civilian. I guess an entire game in an urban city would kind of take away from the whole Uncharted experience, but I think a level or two would be awesome."

The price for GOTY was â¬30, the same price as the DLC. When you buy GOTY, you get more stuff (e.g. a lot of skins). I sold the regular version for 7,50, bought the GOTY edition and saved â¬7.50 (â¬15-20 if you include the skins, which I already unlocked)  If this doesn't work: the flashback maps and the Deception map pack.

uncharted,1a3vaj,Synister_Gates__,3,Mon Mar 11 21:55:37 2013 UTC,That's been on there for 2 years. I thought it was something new. Bummer.
uncharted,1a3vaj,ndiuncharted,2,Tue Mar 12 02:37:51 2013 UTC,"After the PS4 announcement, Sony stated  that ALL 12 first party game developpers are creating PS4-games at the moment. Naughty Dog is one of those 12, so... they are creating a ps4 game! And due the popularity of the Uncharted series (and because they said they would continue the series) I am almost sure that they are developing Uncharted 4."
uncharted,1a3vaj,Rocr,2,Tue Mar 12 06:05:52 2013 UTC,"Also in the hype trailer for ps4, they showed a lot of gameplay from old uncharted games, which almost certainly hints at a new one."
uncharted,1a3vaj,Sir_Llama,3,Tue Mar 12 14:36:49 2013 UTC,Or it's just because Uncharted is one of their most successful franchises...
uncharted,1a3vaj,kacboy,1 point,Wed Mar 13 05:36:12 2013 UTC,Lets just hope its along the lines of Uncharted 2.  I was disappointed when there were never any supernatural enemies in 3... also what the fuck is with the spiders
uncharted,1a3vaj,Kromgar,1 point,Sun Mar 24 04:37:04 2013 UTC,"The spiders gave it an Indiana Jones feel I thought. A lot of people were upset with the inclusion of supernatural elements in the game and that the supernatural enemies in the first two were so close. It was almost redundant ""Oh, mutant people. Got it."" Drake fighting a whole bunch of demons while he was on a really powerful drug made it just seem more realistic. People like this series for the adventure and discovery, but also because the characters are so realistic. They want realism to play a huge role."
uncharted,1a0imw,Fullmetal83,15,Sun Mar 10 06:52:17 2013 UTC,"Uncharted 2 was my favorite.  While I loved 3 and it really pulled me in because of my obsession with T.E. Lawrence, I felt that the story wasn't as well done, nor the gameplay. Sure, it was beautiful but it was also slow in some parts and didn't feel as fluid as the other games. Especially the bits as a kid, where you had to walk or climb. That was incredibly slow and it broke my immersion through frustration.   The first was brilliant as well. I remember the first time that supernatural theme came into play, I was grinning like a maniac at the strange twist it had taken. I loved the 'indiana jones' feel of. However, it felt like it just missed the mark with its potential. Like there was so much more that could have been done. Plus, I enjoy character development and I wanted to see more of Elena and Drake.   Uncharted 2 just had it all. Great action scenes, a fluid storyline and brilliant game play. The locations were brilliant, as well as the dialogue and cut scenes.  Playing it made me lose myself, which is what I wanted. Both 1 and 3 are exceptional but to me, only number 2 gave me the character development and action that I really wanted."
uncharted,1a0imw,arcade_13,7,Sun Mar 10 10:18:30 2013 UTC,"Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is my favorite. Contrary to what others say, I think it has the strongest narrative in the series. Everything about it is deeper and more fleshed out (characters, story, action) and it offers an insightful look into what makes the action hero what he is. Perhaps it wasn't executed as flawlessly as 2 was, but what it brought to the table I thought was fantastic.   Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a very close second. It was my favorite game before 3 came around. Classic, flawless, and everything about it, from the character interactions to the journey itself, kept you engaged and on the edge of your seat the entire time.   Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and Uncharted: Golden Abyss tie for third. Drake's Fortune is a really good game--but it had some noticeable flaws and it felt like everything about it felt like it was one notch away from meeting its true potential--but great nonetheless.   Golden Abyss is great as well, an entertaining side story and its aesthetics, narrative, and gameplay are all a blast and feel closer to Uncharted 2 more than Uncharted 1 (which no easy feat for any game, much less a portable one). Due to its sometimes choppy writing (this is the first title not written by creative director Amy Hennig) and lack of multiplayer keep it from the levels of excellence achieved by Among Thieves and Drake's Deception."
uncharted,1a0imw,wtzll,5,Sun Mar 10 22:56:03 2013 UTC,"I liked 3 the most I would say. Man, I'm a sucker for flashbacks and I always wondered about the ring, the origins and so on, so to get to play as a young Drake + all the awesome music and atmosphere... man, it was something special. Plus the ending, man I soo wanted to kick the baddies ass soo much, ahh the pleasure... :)"
uncharted,1a0imw,taxusbaccata,3,Mon Mar 11 02:44:03 2013 UTC,"Honestly I'm going to say uncharted 1. Not because I think the graphics were better but I liked that it mainly took place on one island with a handful of characters made it seem more gritty and less ""one set action piece to another""   I also liked uncharted 2 ( it's clearly a much better game) but there is something about the first instalment that really captured my imagination. Also those NAZI zombies were by far the best of the evil monsters."
uncharted,1a0imw,8bubbles8joe,2,Sun Mar 10 19:57:26 2013 UTC,"It's close between 2 and 3, with 2 edging out to win. Drake's Fortune was a smaller scale adventure, but exciting nonetheless. Naughty Dog was just getting their footing with DF, and it shows. Some of the climbing and shooting isn't as refined as it is in the sequels, and the levels weren't as much fun to replay. 2 had it all. It felt like an action movie. There was so much variety in what you were doing, and all if the levels are excellent. I don't think there was a single level I didn't enjoy. 3 had the best gameplay of them all, and the best graphics, but the story misses the mark. The villain isn't memorable, and some of the levels just weren't that fun to play, like the one as a child and when you're wandering in the desert."
uncharted,1a0imw,Blink169,1 point,Sun Mar 10 19:47:16 2013 UTC,"I would say Uncharted 3 but the one level where you wander around in the desert really annoyed me. I don't understand why Naughty Dog put that in. It doesn't give Drake much characterization and it's less fun than watching paint dry. Other than that, it was brilliant. Uncharted 2 is definitely my favorite."
uncharted,1a0imw,vietgal,1 point,Sun Mar 10 23:38:17 2013 UTC,"From favorite to least favorite:  Uncharted 3 was my favorite. The graphics were beautiful and although the set pieces weren't as great as UC 2, it stole my heart for some reason.  Uncharted 2, I love the setting. The story is amazing. The train part was amazing.  Uncharted: GA, I really like the refine aiming with the motion controls. Touch screen gimmicks are meh though. The story wasn't the best but at least the enemies weren't a pain like..  Uncharted 1: The story is better than Golden Abyss, but I just got tired of playing it because the enemies just won't stop coming out. Jesus. Oh and also because of those Descendants :s call me a wimp but gosh, those things creep me out."
uncharted,1a0imw,bensawn,1 point,Mon Mar 11 09:00:20 2013 UTC,"i am going to say uncharted 2.  they were all amazing, and each one really did seem to address lingering issues from its predecessor. however, U2 was the best in my mind for one very simple reason: it was the best game.  U3 was an incredible story and had amazing cutscenes and scripted events. however, i felt that it lacked the gameplay that made U2 so much fun to revisit. i think the scene/level where nate is drugged is the best example of this. it is a fascinating way to advance the story, but it isnt that much fun to play through a second time.   U3 seemed to give the story priority over the gameplay, so despite its advances, i still think U2 is the best uncharted game."
uncharted,1a0imw,Tobi_Addams,1 point,Thu Mar 14 04:42:23 2013 UTC,"I think 2 is my favorite.   I loved Nepal, and I adore Buddhist iconography in general, so this game had all kinds of gorgeous going on that tickled me in all the right places. It just a really special place in my imagination."
uncharted,1a0imw,sven_kirk,-3,Thu Apr 18 03:54:05 2013 UTC,"U2 was my favorite. Like you said, the varied environments were awesome. I loved the opening and train sequence.  U3 pissed me off several ways. First, the firefight in the desert. Really? you can't see 10 feet in front of you and you are getting blasted? Second, repeated events in the escape from the burning building. Mostly, but not the last, the crappy storyline. I did like how the game went back to the 'origin' of the story. The back-story pulled me in, and then it ruined it by putting the boss/main-story in there somehow.  Although, I did love the sea levels."
uncharted,19z7ic,RageRedditor3,6,Sat Mar 9 17:25:47 2013 UTC,"I use the Jade M9 for close-mid range, and a Dragon Sniper with Call Out for long range. I'm going to assume you're a Free to Player (if this is inaccurate, then no offense) just based on the timing of the question you've posed, which means you may not have access to the Jade M9/Dragon Sniper, or even unlocked the M9 at all.  In my experience, all of the guns that are available at spawn are DAMN well balanced. With this said, take into consideration your gun's attachments, and use them fully.   For example: if you have the Call Out attachment and you aim at your target, your teammates will see the target too. This means that if you and your target are firing at each other and you are both low on health, DON'T go chasing after the kill if you are confident that a nearby teammate with full health can finish him off.  Also, reload speed is always an advantage, especially for close-range encounters.  I also believe that the scope zoom attachment is very underrated, give it an honest try once or twice.  Overall, the weapon that you choose should solely depend on both the map being played, and what the enemy team's weapons are.   Hope some of this helps, good luck.  Edit: I'd also like to add that learning to be proficient in ALL the weapons will be the most satisfying aspect, this means that you won't be uncomfortable picking up weapons from the ground, especially power weapons.  Small note regarding power weapons: each map has specific power-weapons located in specific spots, learn where these weapons spawn, as well as how long their respawn time is, in order to anticipate its spawn and gain a huge advantage!"

uncharted,19z7ic,Rocr,3,Sat Mar 9 21:12:28 2013 UTC,"I would say the:   AK with the blindfire accuracy and the accuracy mods, or M9 with Faster reload and max ammo/bigger clips/rate of fire   You only need to have Weapon Expert Gold to be able to do this. I strongly recommend to use this booster: you can switch really fast between your two guns (or gun and shield) which gives you a big advantage.  These two guns are extremely powerful. You do have to shoot in bursts to get the best results."

uncharted,19z7ic,Synister_Gates__,3,Sun Mar 10 03:39:35 2013 UTC,"it depends on how you play! if you play up close and personal, i suggest the kal-7 and the shotgun(you need to find it on the map) or if you play away from players like running and gunning i suggest ak-47 and m9 (ak-47 more than m9).  That's my suggestion and use the ""fleet foot"" booster! Try to level it up to lvl 3 so that most players miss when you move around too fast while you are aiming and shooting at them!"
uncharted,19z7ic,Synister_Gates__,3,Sat Mar 9 18:22:52 2013 UTC,"An addition to your comment on the fleet foot booster: The greatest advantage with the third-person perspective in the game is that you can see around corners without the enemy seeing you. With fleet foot, you can ADS (aim down sights) at a target while behind a tall wall, quickly sidestep out of cover to kill the target, and quickly sidestep back into cover again if necessary.  This tactic can be more effective than attaching (pressing circle) to a wall and shooting around the corner for two reasons:   You're not stuck to a wall; more freedom of movement. You're already ADS at your target, so you're more likely to connect first."

uncharted,19wfdm,ddx98,3,Fri Mar 8 07:03:46 2013 UTC,It's the best idea to start out playing the series in order if you ever plan on playing 3 (which you should; I personally find it the best of the PS3 trilogy).   And it also appears you've heard the sentiment that Uncharted 1 isn't spectacular. It's really good--but the other two are on a whole other level.   Lucky you. Have fun.
uncharted,19wfdm,stevyjohny,3,Sun Mar 10 00:10:55 2013 UTC,"have played for a good 12 hours this weekend. its so good. the graphics, i feel, still hold up and look amazing. the gripes I have found thus far are small (soooo many bullets) but overall it is a fantastic game. I am some how looking forward to 2 and 3 with even more anticipation"
uncharted,19wfdm,bigmuffpi,2,Sun Mar 10 00:22:34 2013 UTC,"good idea, its really worth it to play in order even though the stories dont really follow. However, there are inside jokes in both sequels that refer to previous games. I guess I had the benefit of playing them all in order when they came out so I could only see the improvements moving from UC1 to UC2.   I saw the Uncharted teaser trailer back in 2006 and for some reason new I had to play it when it came out. I picked up UC 1 and took it over to a friends house and we were both blown away. Of course, there were problems but we didn't really notice them because overall the game was so cool and revolutionary. Of course, it is well documented that it was the first game to heavily rely on real actors and cinematic story telling. So I can see the problems for some people who missed the first one and saw the 2nd one or played the 2nd one first. UC1 had a lot of bullet sponge enemies. Still, I think you will be happier playing them in order.  Also, you will save money. I shelled out $60 for each game brand new. However, I became a huge Uncharted freak and don't care I spent almost 200 bucks on these games."

uncharted,19u83i,HipHopAnonymous23,8,Thu Mar 7 10:47:12 2013 UTC,About halfway through.  I honestly feel like I am playing Uncharted 4: Girl Edition   I am completely OK with this
uncharted,19u83i,neon,4,Fri Mar 8 01:08:30 2013 UTC,This is exactly how I saw it as well. Finished the game yesterday and loved every minute. I vote for more inspired copies of TR and Uncharted not less!
uncharted,19u83i,iinventedthenight,3,Fri Mar 8 13:14:48 2013 UTC,"I was expecting an ""Unchrted-lite"". Pretty much like Uncharted but with Lara Croft.   I was completely wrong.  Sure, you have the cinematic set-pieces but there's a lot more to the game - it actually reminds me a lot of Metroid Prime as the exploration in upgrading is done extremely well. The areas often have multiple ways to progress (except the set-piece settings) and it feels completely different."
uncharted,19u83i,cube1701,6,Thu Mar 7 16:49:33 2013 UTC,"I'm glad you're approaching this is a simple comparison and not fanboy ranting.  I haven't played Tomb Raider yet, but I watched a lot of the MP demo and the MP gameplay also looks fairly similar to Uncharted's, with the exception that Tomb Raider's has a bit of asymmetrical balance in some game modes.  I guess the major difference this time around is probably the tone.  Tomb Raider is a more seriously toned, raw survival game and Uncharted is an often humorous (relatively superficial, sorry to say) treasure/adventure hunting game.  I'm a fan of both franchises, and I wouldn't want these comparisons to detract from what makes them so great."
uncharted,19u83i,amazingseiderman,2,Thu Mar 7 13:45:59 2013 UTC,"Except for this young woman's uncanny ability to stab people in the neck with a climbing axe without remorse, something I never saw Nate do ;)"

uncharted,19u83i,FF7F24,2,Fri Mar 8 01:00:48 2013 UTC,"Yes, it seems really familiar to uncharted. The irony is that Uncharted was considered to be a newer/male tomb raider. I was always miffed by that comparison. I would say in spirit it was. However, does that mean every action adventure game is a copy cat of tomb raider?   Uncharted was the first truly cinematic game. Tomb Raider was never cinematic. It was mostly adventure. The enemies were mostly animals and traps. Uncharted was really light on the puzzles compared to tomb raider and the climbing was not as sophisticated. Tomb Raider was basically an advanced platformer. And that is not a criticism. I have enjoyed tomb raider games immensely. I think Uncharted influenced the gaming world more than tomb raider did. We started to see a lot more scripted sequences in games especially call of duty. In fact, I think it even became a problem at least for me. There was a lot of money poured into ""money"" moments. However, I think Uncharted still has everyone beat because their big stage sequences were playable.   Its difficult to critique the new Tomb Raider because it is really cool. A lot of did seem really scripted in the beginning even more so than Uncharted at times. However, the game has a lot more open areas as well later on. Overall, it was different than I expected. It borrows from other games to with the upgrade system. And I think it does enough unique things to make it feel different. But yes, similarities for sure."
uncharted,19u83i,stevyjohny,1 point,Sat Mar 9 15:52:51 2013 UTC,"It may be a bit long, but XboxAhoy points out a lot of the similarities to other games (mostly Farcry 3) without even mentioning Uncharted in this video."

They firing sounds much more crisp and powerful in this video. Or did they just adjust it to be a bit more appealing in advertising?  Side-note: It's pretty cool to think that even with major graphical changes coming up with the fast-approaching new console generation that these titles' aesthetic design will always look pretty good. At least that's what I think by looking at it--like if Pixar decided to design things with a bit more a realistic art-choice but then added a layer of an almost painted-on polish that reflects older pulp-adventure comics."
uncharted,19a2iu,Sir_Llama,2,Tue Feb 26 20:38:28 2013 UTC,"Wow, the pricing on this are ridiculous! Level cap at 15 and $5 more only gets you to level 25? This is probably the worst f2p models I've ever seen. Absolutely pathetic and I hope they get no money from this."

uncharted,19a2iu,myballsareitchy,2,Tue Feb 26 22:18:33 2013 UTC,Yeah some of the pricing seems a bit off to me. I thought that they would have gone completely free-to-play by now and based it off of TF2 with all of the little micro-transactions that are possible. But I guess that since the community still pulls in half a million players online each day and a there is a steady enough purchase rate of new copies to justify it all not being completely free in their eyes.

I got into gaming as my brother in law had a PS3 and we played Call of Duty together, so I got my own system and played mainly Call of Duty for about two years, until I started trying out other games. Yeah, I've been missing out.  I loved the campaign for Uncharted 3, but have never tried the multiplayer.

Edit: dont trow the special bombs (cluster and big bomb) directly to the ground. It that way they can throw it back. When you are standing on the towers throw at side of those things hanging above the 'net'. Clusterbomb will explode before hitting the ground, scattering the bombs even further: succes guarenteed.

As you can see, not all bullets fired will hit the target at the exact place you aimed for. The bullets are scattered around it. The accuracy mod decreases the scattering, so more bullets hit the target at the place you aimed on.  The accuracy mod for the pistols works the same.  *The Firerate mod will increase your firerate, but will decrease your accuracy (will increase the scattering)"
uncharted,17md88,Rocr,2,Thu Jan 31 16:53:23 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the link.  Follow up question:  I noticed that none of the ""special"" AK's that have multiple mods have the accuracy mod, is that because it's good enough by itself and the gun would be overpowered?"
uncharted,17md88,Rocr,3,Thu Jan 31 20:13:21 2013 UTC,"I think it is because they would be overpowered for unlockable guns. However it is possible to have two mods of your own choice. When you reach rank 45, you will unlock the Booster Weapon Expert (slot 1). When you level the booster up to level 3 you are able to choose two mods. So you can choose M9 with Rate of Fire and Faster reload, which will be an unbeatable gun...   In level 1 of the booster you will be able to add two mods to your pistols. It is one of the best boosters in the game. Als because level two makes it possible to switch quickly between your pistol and your long rifle. So when you are shooting on someone and your clips is almost empty, you can press Triangle to switch immediatly to your pistol and keep shooting."

uncharted,17hja9,Rocr,11,Tue Jan 29 09:29:23 2013 UTC,"It's modeled heavily after Indiana Jones, so all the games have some sort of a supernatural thing going on.  I thought the same as you at first but by the end of the game I was quite alright with it."
uncharted,17hja9,hobowillie,8,Tue Jan 29 10:54:22 2013 UTC,Yep. Uncharted is very intentionally in the mold of classic pulp novels. I've never understood why the supernatural hook was such a mountain for people to climb.
uncharted,17hja9,stuntmanmike,7,Tue Jan 29 14:57:00 2013 UTC,"I thought the ""zombie mutants"" were a bit random when I first saw them, but that's because I wasn't paying attention.  They allude to this phenomenon throughout the game.    The story and environments in all three games still remain very grounded and real, even while incorporating supernatural elements.   It's definitely an unexpected twist, but that should hardly deter you from a wonderful saga. =)"
uncharted,17hja9,amazingseiderman,3,Tue Jan 29 12:56:50 2013 UTC,"When I first was playing this game, I was really into it because my OCD was making me collect all the treasures and the story was REALLY fucking good, but when I first saw the zombie leaping in the distance I just thought to myself ""Shit... just... got... REAL"" and I immediately started trying to figure out where they came from or why they were there. It also made the game a lot better for me because it made the game more about adventure and the unknown; not just about finding buried treasure. I agree with other people in that I'm not sure why the zombies and the other supernatural things in the other 2 games are such a big deal for people to come to terms with; if you like the Indiana Jones movies, the supernatural coming into play in treasure hunting should not come as a surprise to you and frankly should not take you out of the story at all. Just keep playing, all will be explained in time :)"

uncharted,17bj7f,Veggar,3,Sat Jan 26 17:51:34 2013 UTC,You get a pass for one account if you buy the game new.
uncharted,17bj7f,Sir_Llama,3,Sat Jan 26 18:14:11 2013 UTC,"I think more customization: more colors, combine clothes from different characters, etc. This is sometging they have been talking about for a while now on the forums.   Also, the F2P seems to be a logic step considering their previous actions.  The Lab maps will be playable in custom games and will prob get their own playlist (although maybe not in this update).   I'm hoping for some more co-op stuff, but i'm 99,999% sure that that wont happen.."

A good chunk would be made from the DLC MapPacks (what I think you're referring to, because all of the DLC being free means they make no money at all), but I could see them cutting back some of those prices."
uncharted,17bj7f,bilge6,2,Sat Jan 26 17:50:19 2013 UTC,I was thinking more along the lines of paying for the service would give you free access to all dlc. Basically the new fortune hunters club
uncharted,17bj7f,Tysen,2,Sat Jan 26 20:25:18 2013 UTC,"I think they'll introduce F2P to expand the player pool and make in-game dlc (like taunts etc) purchasable using in-game money for current players (if that's even technically possible). Just before TLOU comes out, they might even make a few DLC maps free to help keep the game alive."

uncharted,17aqnk,sambills,2,Sat Jan 26 07:46:31 2013 UTC,"Uncharted should a year after the PS4 launch.   PLOT: Would love to see Nate get dragged back into his adventuring life somehow--since he gave it up at the end of 3. He has to still be with Elena at the beginning of this one too. I want to see more of his past girls, even if they're just humorous cameos. Kill off a main/recurring character. Bring up the fact that Nate kills a ton of people and he's sick of destroying lives and wants to make some (pregnant Elena?).   Whatever it takes, the next monsters should be DINOSAURS. I want to see what Naughty Dog can do with next-gen tech and dinosaurs. Imagine if one setpiece was like the brontosaur-stampede in King Kong but instead of just running between their legs, you're shooting at other soldiers, fighting off raptors, climbing up the dinosaurs and leaping from one to another. IMAGINE A BATTLE WITH A T-REX.  Maybe, to tie this all together: confront the fact that Nate has killed/kills a ton of people. He is sick of destroying lives and wants to make some (a child with Elena--possibly pregnant?). However he gets dragged back into this life the end result should be the Garden of Eden (where life started kind of--and why the hell can't dinosaurs? Plus, some goddamn flame-sworded cherubs would be cool too) and the Macguffin could be the Knowledge Fruit (Nate is a book-worm and knowledge would appeal to him too). Loses someone important on the way. Of course in the end he wins, refuses the Fruit, and leaves violence to go do something productive (raise family, be with friends, maybe teach--just live)."

I would suggest trying to load the game on another account, without previous save data present.  If it works, you've got your answer.  If it doesn't, and you're sure you've done a complete wipe/reinstall of the old Uncharted game data, then it's probably a hardware issue, although that seems pretty unlikely based on your description.

uncharted,16i9uz,TheSkittle,2,Sun Jan 13 22:02:33 2013 UTC,"I agree, the skeleton characters in multiplayer somehow just feel invincible."
uncharted,16i9uz,iLLmatic_D_indo,1 point,Sun Jan 13 23:17:50 2013 UTC,"I never got why people used them. Does it really have something to do with being partially invincible, or is it just a show-off thing?"

uncharted,16i9uz,coffee_beanz,2,Mon Jan 14 00:43:25 2013 UTC,"I do the same thing as others have said, suicide after you get the treasure. But one thing I noticed is that I felt like I had exhausted all the treasures on Coop Crushing and was getting nowhere. Randomly tried Coop Hard and got what I needed. So maybe switching between Hard and Crushing?"
uncharted,16i9uz,Plex0re,1 point,Mon Jan 14 04:59:28 2013 UTC,"hard and crushing have the same drop rate, I do speculate your chances are increased switching from different modes (arena, adventure, etc) due to the reset."
uncharted,16i9uz,Awesomenchilada9,1 point,Mon Jan 14 16:58:48 2013 UTC,"It's just luck. For me, I get my treasures in TDM. If you get multiple medals in rapid succession, a spree or w/e, expect to get a lot treasure drops in that match. Especially green ones. To me, I get more treasures from TDM and in a more rapid pace than Co-Op. If you're good on competitive, then I recommend to get your treasures there."
uncharted,16i9uz,soul_power,4,Sun Jan 13 21:50:22 2013 UTC,You need to review the treasure drop system because everything you just said shows you don't understand it at all.
uncharted,16i9uz,kacboy,1 point,Mon Jan 14 02:56:30 2013 UTC,Luck. Pray for another increased rare-treasure weekend.

It's hard as fuck.  But, I'll add you and am down to play when not doing schoolwork!  My PSN is MaryJaneParker.  I love competitive matches, but sometimes co-op is nice for a change."

I don't get on as much any more but if you ever see me on I LOVE co-op and would love to play any crushing a with you!

uncharted,16848r,Trolldified,2,Wed Jan 9 03:20:16 2013 UTC,There's a lot more problems with customization than just hair.
uncharted,16848r,kacboy,2,Thu Jan 10 07:24:30 2013 UTC,I'm honestly fine with everything else. What were you thinking that's wrong?

uncharted,16848r,Jessie246,2,Fri Jan 11 02:21:09 2013 UTC,I wish you could have a female custom person other than the main characters. I love custom characters but I don't think its fair that you can only have a male character.
uncharted,16848r,stanleythecow,1 point,Wed Feb 13 14:13:55 2013 UTC,"I completely agree, and it would alot way more diversity too."
