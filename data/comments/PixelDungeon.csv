PixelDungeon,3e3lzd,Leuten,7,Tue Jul 21 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"If you encounter a warlock you have 2 options. 1. If the Warlock is closer to you than any door is, approach it and beat the shit out of it. They're weak at melee. 2. If there is a door closer to you then the Warlock, run to the door and wait on the other side of it for the Warlock to appear in it. and beat the shit out of it. They're weak at melee. That's how I role. Monks are annoying, but shouldn't be any danger if you're only fighting a monk, Remember to always use doorways/hallways to reduce the amount of enemies you're fighting at 1 time"

This usually isn't necessary though and is a throwaway for when you find better. Save them for worthwhile gear, upgrade scrolls are limited and not to be wasted. It is also recommended to save one on the off chance you find a well of transmutation. Drink them. There's absolutely no reason to not. 90% of the time no. It's okay to equip leather right away generally (although you're risking being cursed) otherwise I'd only equip high level gear to let low level mobs hit me to identify it, do not move around with it... it's a waste of hunger. Weapons I wouldn't, they slow you down enough to be fatal. Without remove curse scrolls you are taking a risk equipping random gear though, that's something to remember."

So Yes. Drink them. If you're new to the game, still learning and understanding what cursed weapons are etc. I don't suggest equipping anything unidentified (Except for artifacts, they're usually worth the risk.) If something is identified and you don't have enough Strength to use it, Don't. You move a lot slower (when its armour) and attack a lot slower and less accurately when its a weapon.   If you have any other questions, feel free to ask, most of this community is usually happy to help beginners I'm sure. :P"

Gives above average regen for wand charges on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Lighting - Pretty much still the same thing as before, Targets anything adjacent to your target, does more on stuff in water                       Has a chance to zap enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Fireblast - Now uses all charges on the wand, more charges used, give a large area (all tiles hit lit on fire)                       Gives chance to light enemy on fire on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Regrowth - Same as Wand of Fireblast in use, but creates grass and roots anything inside it (for a short time) also has a chance of creating plants (like sorrowmoss etc.)                            Gives herbal healing on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Transmutation - Uses a chunk of your life to Hurt enemies, or heal allies (like the Sad Ghost spawned from Dried Rose) and i believe if you fire it at a cursed item thats sitting on the ground, it removes the curse..            Gives chance to ""pre-charge"" your staff (next shot doesn't cost you health) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.       Wand of Disintegration - and fire through walls  and enemies, the more enemies (and apparently tiles?) it fires through, the more damage it deals.                         Gives grim effect (chance to instant kill on hit) when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Prismatic Light - Fires a beam of like that can have the magic mapping effect on shadows (not sure how to do this, it has just kinda happened afew times) deals some damage and has a chance to blind the target.                Gives chance to cripple enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Venom - creates a gas in the air (similiar to toxic gas) called venom, venom becomes a status ailment on anything inside the gas, and deals damage like poison, but does more damage the longer the status exists.             Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.          Wand of Blastwave - Deals area damage that pushes anything and effects tiles that are close enough to the impact a distance away (paralyzes enemies hit into walls)                                       Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Frost - Gives target ""Chilled"" effect, which slows them down, and if the target is standing on a water tile, it freezes them.                                               Gives chilled effect to enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Corruption - Uses it's charges to take over enemies (permanently) the stronger the enemy, the more charges it takes (doesn't work on bosses, but it does work on things spawned by bosses, like the Dwarf King's skeletons and possibly God Larvae) and if the target is succesfully corrupted, their health is restored.                       Gives amok effect to enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.        Wand of Living Earth - I have not yet received this wand, but i can't wait to try it out!!                                 Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.      Wand of Warding - I have not yet received this wand, but i can't wait to try it out!!                                Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  So, i may not have done a good job explaining the wands, but i tried.                                    Note: All Wands I explained do damage (I can not exactly explain how much) except for Corruption and Regrowth.                                Blandfruit   (Warning: Fruit names may be incorrect)                       Fruitname = Seed used + Blandfruit - Fruit's effect  Rotfruit = Rotberry + Blandfruit - Gives player + 1 Strength when eaten.                             Sunfruit = Sungrass + Blandfruit - Fully restores health player when eaten.                  Icefruit = * + Blandfruit* - When eaten works like Frozen Carpaccio, or can be throw to be used like Potion of Frost                                            Sorrowfruit = Sorrowmoss + Blandfruit -When eaten, You have a toxic gas aura around you that you are immune to.                                              Firefruit = Firebloom + Blandfruit - When eaten, Your melee attacks now (have a chance to?) light your target on fire.                                             Dreamfruit = Dreamweed + Blandfruit - Purification potion effect when eaten (possibly when thrown too?).                                             Blindfruit = Blindweed + Blandfruit - When eaten, you turn invisible.                                             Earthfruit = Earthroot + Blandfruit - When eaten, Your melee attacks now (have a chance to?) root your enemies.                                             Stormfruit = Stormvine + Blandfruit - Gives levitate effect when eaten (Vertigo gas when thrown?).                                             Starfruit = Starfruit(?) + Blandfruit - Levels up the player when eaten.                                             **** = * + Blandfruit* - ______________"

It seems like a feature for idiots but if you stop playing for even a short time you can quickly forget what you were planning at the time.  There are plenty of other times I wish I could scroll back as well this is just one example."

PixelDungeon,3dluh5,lntuitive,4,Fri Jul 17 09:05:44 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with /u/jestertiko actually.  Other than Skillful I've never played a roguelike in my life that has a difficulty option; It goes against so much of the genre's philosophy that's been built over the decades.  A roguelike isn't about winning, if it's to hard you shouldn't be able to click a button that makes it easier so that you can waltz past the hard part. You play again and you learn. It's largely a game of knowledge... that's the magic that makes them special compared to something like a RPG. Things I could never beat but now consistently can, not because I lowered the difficulty but because I learned to be a better player."
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,mrfluffleupagus,2,Fri Jul 17 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"I was going to reply with this exact argument. Adding a difficulty slider cheapens the whole experience and it is not something I have any plans to implement.  I do still think the overall difficulty curve in Shattered needs more smoothing and consistency though. I'm also not against there being easier experiences in Shattered, but they won't be part of the main dungeon, as I don't want to give an easy mode to it for the above reasons."
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,00-Evan,2,Fri Jul 17 17:18:09 2015 UTC,K thanks for the reply.  I just felt like winning depended alot on how lucky I was but I guess that must be because I'm not all that good.  Better git gud.
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,00-Evan,2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:01 2015 UTC,You can do a lot to counteract luck but I do agree that the variance in the game is too high at the moment. That's more of a general balance problem than a difficulty one though.
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,SGAdventures,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"There can certainly be a lot of 'luck' based play, item drops being the most obvious. But other than the occasional fluke streak of high damage hits from an enemy, most of it can be negated. If you can 'force' a character (with careful play) for long enough, you are bound to find a decent weapon/staff or armour eventually and then you're set.  With practice you can get win rates up to 1/3-1/6 games played. You just need to take into account things that you might normally attribute to 'luck'. For instance if a stepping on a trap would kill then search before every step. Sounds laborious, but it's a rogue type game after all.  Do you want to rush through and die lots or take your time and ensure a good run? With more practice and good habits you can get to the point where you make good decisions fast, but when beginning if you slow down and take each turn as it comes then you should be fine."
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,Leuten,2,Sun Jul 19 06:09:21 2015 UTC,But wouldn't I starve and die if I do that?
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,BilbolDev,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:44:43 2015 UTC,"I myself always Search the entire floor (even after magic mapping and when i know nothing is left of it) like most other people, the main issue i encounter is that often times I always act with a sense of urgency, i play the game as if it isn't turn based, i go through places a lot quicker, but its lead to a lot of deaths. Sometimes i can manage to play some games slowly once i've gotten my good loot, but I don't feel I can unlearn this play style, as possibly suggested by my current 1/856 Wins"
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,Scharnvirk,2,Sun Jul 19 09:41:57 2015 UTC,"I can see your point. If I may make a suggestion here. Have an easy mode that stops after Goo. Most players complain that the first 5 levels are the hardest. You can add an easy mode that ends after Goo and shows a message saying ""You're good enough for the real thing now""  No badges would unlock in your easy mode.   I am sure this will maintain the experience while offering an easy 'demo' mode"
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,Scharnvirk,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:19 2015 UTC,If someone is struggling with the Goo he will die to skeletons later on.
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,JoshuMertens,2,Fri Jul 17 21:07:01 2015 UTC,Aye! That's the best thing about roguelikes: it is the player who actually levels up his knowledge and let it stay this way.
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,jestertiko,2,Fri Jul 17 21:07:48 2015 UTC,Its called roguelike for a reason. Youre dungeoneering through the unknown. Its pretty stupid if youre waltzing through the challenges without actual challenges. It loses the essence of being a roguelike if it has difficulty settings.
PixelDungeon,3dluh5,jestertiko,0,Sat Jul 18 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"If you can't beat it now, you try again. If you just want to play something easier, why not just go play another game?"
PixelDungeon,3dirz5,taro_root,7,Thu Jul 16 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"I personally don't agree with your thoughts on assassin, as cloak of shadows is not that important for a lot of situations, as without it you can still me through doors, and even if you don't, your fighting is as good as freerunner's.  A staff imbued with a wand of disintegration acts the same as a weapon enchanted with grim, giving you a chance to instakill a creature, excepting bosses."
PixelDungeon,3dirz5,RagingAlien,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"I would say cloak of shadows is very important for an Assassin play through. it mitigates damage and ends most fights in 2 player attacks and 1 ai attack. hide behind door,wait for monster, hit it-monster hits you- you cloak and hit- it dies. that's how you play assassin with efficiency. you're not trying to do as well as free runner in fighting because it is worse than assassin in combat efficiency."
PixelDungeon,3dirz5,jestertiko,3,Fri Jul 17 11:56:10 2015 UTC,"You need to dump all your upgrades into your staff/boomerang, or else it won't do enough damage."
PixelDungeon,3dirz5,hpp3,2,Thu Jul 16 20:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'm attempting to finish with all 4 classes as well.  Did it as a berzerker, sniper, and assassin so far, looking for the mage win.  Wand of disintegration gives the grim enchantment fyi, love it at high levels"
PixelDungeon,3dirz5,fistsforall,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"About sniper : boomerang's damage are not weak. If you have nothing usefull for kitting, you need to play super safe and throw something at each door to avoid melee fights. When you are in small rooms keep doors open so you won't be surprised. If you don't have any good wand/ring, it also means that all scrolls of upgrade are on your boomerang. Balance it to be lighter and you should be able to kill almost all mobs in 2-4 turns.   In my opinion Sniper is the most powerfull class once you understand how to play with her. Mostly because you don't relie on luck as you start with the most OP item in the game : your lovely boomerang.   P. S : The field of view is a strange thing in PD, in some situations you can see your ennemy but he can't see you, it means you have 2 turns of surprise attack. Abusing it will make the game A LOT easier, especially when you have to deal with high parry/dodge rate mobs."
PixelDungeon,3dirz5,Nawel_Do,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:53:32 2015 UTC,"I always have trouble getting out of sticky situations.  Once enemies are in my face it's hard for me to deal with them.  Also, crabs give me a lot of early game trouble.  I do enjoy the alternate playstyle though.  Sniper and Battlemage are probably the most fun for me."
PixelDungeon,3dirz5,eable2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:16:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, early game is the hardest for sniper. My advice is to not be afraid to upgrade your boomerang and use it at melee range if you have to. It does a LOT of damage against crabs, even if you miss sometimes."

PixelDungeon,3dfyse,v3xx,6,Wed Jul 15 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"The chance of discovering a random tile as you move is dependent on a somewhat unknown variable called awareness, which increases with your hero level. Awareness is a decimal representation of the chance of discovering hidden tiles. For example, when awareness is 0.1 then you have a 10% chance of discovering a hidden tile when you move next to it.  The formula for awareness is   awareness = 1 - (0.9^(level+1) / 2)       (warrior, mage, huntress) awareness = 1 - (0.85^(level+1) / 2)      (rogue)   where level represents your hero level. However, level maxes out at 9, even if your hero level increases beyond that, so the maximum awareness value is 0.4095. (You can view a table of awareness values here.)  Awareness is not increased with a Ring of Detection (vanilla) nor with a Talisman of Foresight (shattered). A cursed Talisman of Foresight, however, decreases awareness to -1, therefore making it impossible to accidentally find hidden tiles.  TLDR: Chance of discovery is based on hero level. Look here for a table of values."

Now, active awareness only affects search duration."

PixelDungeon,3dh9yp,gillecave500,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:26:42 2015 UTC,"For me the one thing that made my first win possible was a Wand of Regrowth (+2) and farming healing potions. Wasn't very exciting but I farmed about 20 healing potions on level 11 (I think?) from the bats, while at the same time using the Wand of Regrowth to fill my dew bottle and stock up on seeds, especially sungrass. It is probably better though to farm the healing potions from flies in earlier levels, I just did it there because I found the wand around those levels. I needed almost all of them in the last boss fight, mostly because it was my first time there and I didn't know how it works. So, my advice is, even though it is not exciting, farming for healing potions can help a lot.  Also, this is a bit of advanced advice in terms of levels, get enough Scrolls of Mind Mapping (3+) and Potions of Mind Vision (minimum 3 as well, better more) and maybe even some Scrolls of Teleportation before you enter the demon halls (from level 22). Do not attempt to fight anything, use Mind Mapping to see where the exit is, use the Mind Vision potions to avoid the monsters as best as you can. Emergency teleportation if things get real bad and you can't avoid certain monsters, but then you may end up waking more of course. This is just advice should you finally make it to the demon halls, as my first 2 tries there were basically over after level 22 as I got killed by those nasty monsters."

PixelDungeon,3dchy0,00-Evan,4,Wed Jul 15 04:54:16 2015 UTC,"My UI suggestions:   Most other roguelikes differentiate between ""walking"" (moving one tile at a time) and ""running"" (moving several tiles with a single input). Running is interrupted when an enemy becomes visible and is usually completely disabled when there are any enemies visible in other roguelikes. Perhaps shattered should adopt the same approach? Targeting is still weird as hell in this game. Sometimes you target a square, and it misses. Sometimes it hits an obstacle on the way. The correct way to target is to aim several squares beyond where you want to hit which is a convoluted process. It's probably too radical of a change to revamp how targeting works at this point. But the user interface for targeting can be made better. How about an aim assist option, where the hypothetical path of a shot is displayed and can be reviewed to see if it collides with obstacles before being fired? It can also be used to fish around for the square that you have to target in order for the path of the shit to hit the square you actually want.  It is tedious moving up and down levels, especially if you are backtracking. I suggest a shortcut for ""take me to the down staircase"" be added to the upper part of the screen (either the left or the right, similar to the monster notification) once the staircase is found. Tapping on this causes the character to ""run"" towards the down stairs, stopping when danger is encountered. Double tapping toggles the icon to up staircase instead, and tapping it then causes the character to move towards the upstairs.  While already standing on the stairs, tapping the corresponding button causes the character to use the stairs."
PixelDungeon,3dchy0,hpp3,2,Wed Jul 15 07:50:36 2015 UTC,"I love the up/down stairs idea that's great, though the walking/running isn't really that much of an issue and would clutter UI more I think.  Good ideas though."
PixelDungeon,3dchy0,Spiderant,2,Wed Jul 15 12:14:49 2015 UTC,"To reply to each point:   I'm not looking into changing the basic movement mechanics right now. Plus I'd like to get a better understanding of why other roguelikes do this first, do you have an example of a game that does this? Agreed, it's a difficult issue though due to the way the game handles targeting. Basically anything you see you CAN target, but often-times it involves targeting behind them for the reasons you've mentioned. I do have plans to possible make auto-targeting more intelligent in this regard now that it'll be used more often, we'll see how that works out. I can see how something like this would be helpful, but there's limited room in the UI as-is."
PixelDungeon,3dchy0,hpp3,2,Wed Jul 15 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is an example. The basic motivation is that combat is the most dangerous situation in the game, so you are forced to resolve the situation by moving one square at a time.  Fast travel is a convenience feature, and is inappropriate during combat. Here's a post I submitted a few months back with more of my and others' thoughts on the matter."

PixelDungeon,3dchy0,Omen267901,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the issue is more aggravated in PD because of how easy it is to trigger automovement through a misclick. I understand the use case of tapping on a far away door when there is a dwarf monk next to you to lead him to the doorway, but also consider the case when you miss the bottom right corner of the screen and instead of opening inventory, you start moving towards that direction. Meanwhile, you walk around a earth elemental while there is a dwarf necromancer zapping you (i.e. YASD). How about requiring extra confirmation to trigger automovement during combat then?"
PixelDungeon,3dchy0,EstherDarkish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"Given that some people are aggravated by double tapping to search, I imagine that adding something like this would add a lot of frustration to combat for many users.

PixelDungeon,3dchy0,C4vey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could try the system that SLASH'EM for iOS had? It's a wonderfully elegant solution.  You can only activate fast travel if you pan the screen first.   [CURRENT] The screen defaults to being centered on your character. You can pan the screen by dragging the screen. When you move, the pan resets and the screen is centered again. You can always tap a square next to your character to move there. You can also always tap a distant square to fast travel there.   [CHANGED] The screen defaults to being centered on your character. You can pan the screen by dragging the screen. When you move, the pan resets and the screen is centered again. You can always tap a square next to your character to move there. You can also tap a distant square to fast travel there, but only if the screen has been panned (is not centered).  Motivation: It prevents the accidental fat finger problem entirely. Even with damage interrupting the player, it's still unpleasant to run halfway across the level due to accidental inputs. In 99% of normal intended fast travel use cases, the player first pans the screen anyway. So requiring the screen to be panned adds minimal overhead to the normal use case. As for being intuitive, I figured it out pretty quickly in SLASH'EM without being told how it worked."

To me, the space between the left and right group of buttons is totally useless in this screen and could be used for something else (bigger buttons?)  But i love the idea, and i love the flexibility of the new menu features. Maybe you could add something for the buttons too? A slidebar option to modify the buttons' size, from 50% to 150% perhaps ?   From a code implementation pov, you could check the current screen max size and deduce a set of max values for the current device. As an example, if you have a small screen, 3 quickslots could be the max with a 120% button zoom, and you could select this zooming option only if you selected 3 quickslots or less."

From there I use the haste to destroy the printers as fast as possible. Once the printers are taken out, I focus on thinning out the Robots as much as possible before I focus on DM-4000. If there are too many robots grouped together I will use a scroll of rage to make them damage each other while I use splash to get away. DM-4000 is a true annoyance due to him having a ranged attack, usually forcing you to confront him inside of his gas. As long as you've grinder the dew and have your weapon at a high upgrade, you should be able to destroy him within the course of 1 or 2 purification pots.  Good luck on beating it! (P.S: Grim will make everything so much easier)"

PixelDungeon,3d4grm,dachhack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"I think it is good as it currently is with the special levels, not really missing the water function.  Quick question about the key levels. I just got to the albino piranha level and I noped away pretty fast when I saw how powerful they were. Just curious what is the prize for killing 100 of those evil fish?  Sidenote, really enjoying this update, thank you."
PixelDungeon,3d4grm,portezbie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:00:30 2015 UTC,"You get a full cadre of berries. 10 of each. Plus if you get 100 kills and exit the level at night, you get the ""full moon berry."" ooooh aaaaah  There's a method to the fishing level. They can only see you if you are in the water so levitating or staying on land makes you basically invisible. I like to get on land asap and toss the dumplings to fish the sleeping ones first. Then dangle my feet in the water to attract fish, toss out a dumpling and wait for them to come at me. Then if the timing is right, the dumpling blows before they can get me.  Fishin' accomplished!"
PixelDungeon,3d4grm,portezbie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"Dumpling? I tried killing a few with lightning, but it seemed like too much trouble.  Thanks for the info."
PixelDungeon,3d4grm,portezbie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:55 2015 UTC,there's a chest on the level close to where you start. Also a potion of levitation. The chest has 100 fishing dumpling 'bombs.' They explode when tossed and teleport the fish around the explosion to dry land. The fish explode with dew when they die on land.
PixelDungeon,3d4grm,HuhDude,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"ohhhhh, I remember that chest but didn't go for it. Next time.  I'm finally starting to get the hang of these new bosses. I ended up with a +8 wand of flock because of blessings from the dew, and normally I never use the wand of flock, but it was super helpful in beating tengu."
PixelDungeon,3d4grm,JoshuMertens,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:51:41 2015 UTC,I like the water function - although it did make Sprouted more of a 'fun' game than a 'challenging' game.
PixelDungeon,3d4grm,redsky1397,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:12:06 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure maybe Water will be more interesting if it have a different function.. maybe a holy wall makes our character immune to any damage while able to still run  And i hope the gnoll forest can be more complex..

PixelDungeon,3d4grm,portezbie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"Is there a wiki for Sprouted PD? I have not found any explanation of what the dew vial does differently with this mod.  Edit: I should reword this, I meant to ask what the previous version of the dew vile did with the ""water"" option. I never made it too far with the previous mod to experiment with the vial. I am playing the new version now and notice the dew goes straight to the vial and does not got to my missing health first, 2hich works fore since I either skip the vial and just eat the drops as needed and skip the ones I don't need."
PixelDungeon,3d4grm,portezbie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:22:34 2015 UTC,The water allowed yiu to farm dew drops which once the vial reaches 100 allows you to bless your gear to upgrade it   With the water removed you bow need to collect dew from other sources to bless your gear.

If you go back to the light level there will be another potion or two of levitation at the start. Grab them, drop into the chasm again, heal, go back to the light level, grab the potions, drop down, heal, repeat as much as you can.... or farm levitation potions some other way. Or cloud berries."

PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,v3xx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:52:53 2015 UTC,Love the game so far and the beat part is they kept the old search button instead of the double tap.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,00-Evan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, are you upset specifically because you have to double tap to search, or because this disrupts the spam-search-to-wait exploit? If it's the latter, I plan on just letting wait work while hungry in the next beta cycle."
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,taconnoisseur,4,Sun Jul 12 22:22:26 2015 UTC,It was also useful with herbal healing
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,lemon_tea,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the search-to-wait exploit is, but I used the long-press on the search button to facilitate healing all the time."
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,v3xx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:27:41 2015 UTC,I didn't even know about an exploit I just don't like the feature. Hard to explain. I mean if it stays it stays but personally I like the 2 separate buttons.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:11:42 2015 UTC,Ultimately it's a question of what to do with the space. I made the call that it was worth it to make room for 3-4 quickslots.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,v3xx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:10:01 2015 UTC,Yeah you're limited with no physical buttons.  I would love to play pixel dungeon on my 3ds or even my xbox. I hope some day you guys get together and talk about an indie release for consoles.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,insanechipmunk,3,Mon Jul 13 01:26:02 2015 UTC,"That will likely never happen.  Co soles have a process to ensure quality that cost thousands of dollars and sometimes has to be repeated.  I also believe that the original vreator released the code without giving the rights to commercialize it (not completely sure on that though.)    What that means is someone would have to pay a lot of money to get it on a console and wouldn't be able to make money on it.  Unless a dev feels like paying thousands to let people play, there isn't going to be a formal release on the big 3."
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,AimlessZealot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:41:55 2015 UTC,"The original creator, Watabou, released Pixel Dungeon under the GPLv3 License (and all developers who work off of that code must abide by the same as per that license). GPLv3 does not stop anyone from selling anything, it simply requires that if you sell something (anything) that you must make the source code for that thing available either as an included part of the package or via an offer in the package (such as a link like Pixel Dungeon has in its about). That said, those people who get access to your source code must have the same rights that you do, meaning they could turn around and release it to anyone they wanted to without the cost so long as they continue the rest of the GPLv3 requirements. Copyleft requires some getting used to:)"
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,jengelke,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:59:08 2015 UTC,That would be odd with diagonal directions.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,TheNewDefaultsSuck,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:44:07 2015 UTC,Can it be made an option to have a dedicated search button? Then if activated it restricts the number of quickslots.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"I could make that an option, but I would rather push forward with the new layouts instead of creating lots of options to keep around legacy stuff. Primarily I'm against letting the separate buttons stay as I haven't heard an argument in their favour aside from ""I'm used to it"". I get that change can be annoying though, so if there's a big demand for it I could reintroduce the old toolbar layout as an option.  Currently I'm planning on having 3 toolbar modes (all of which are reversible):   Split (the current one in the beta) Grouped (all the button are on the right side, from left to right: quickslots, inventory, search, wait.) Centered (grouped but in the center of the screen)   It wouldn't be too much trouble to add in a 4th ""classic"" mode which emulates the old toolbar, but as I said I would prefer to push players a bit out of their comfort zone in order to put in more functionality."
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,TheNewDefaultsSuck,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"More functionality is great!   My thinking was that at the beginning of a run I will likely not be using many (most?) of the quickslots so having two distinct buttons could be more convenient. As I fill up the quickslots, their convenience likely outweighs a distinct search button. I could see myself switching midway through a run from one layout to another."
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,00-Evan,2,Mon Jul 13 17:14:00 2015 UTC,Is double-tapping really such an inconvenience that having to switch layouts mid-game is worth it though? This goes back to my previous point about being used to things being a certain way. If the inconvenience is largely caused by unfamiliarity I would rather force people to adapt.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:33:13 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand. I didn't think I was going to like it at first either but it retains all function and ease of use... The biggest change was as Evan said the exploit (which I was incredibly guilty of :P) and saving space.
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,v3xx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I won't complain if he keeps it, its just a personal preference."
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:07:35 2015 UTC,Fair enough. :P
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,sporkexec,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:54:09 2015 UTC,"I don't like the double tap because everything else is a single tap except sleep, which is a long press. So now you need to long press to sleep, double tap to search, and single tap for everything else.  Right now I find myself trying to long press to search all the time, since that's been the norm for secondary actions (i.e. ""it's what I'm used to"").  This would be much more consistent by making search a long press or sleep a double tap."
PixelDungeon,3d1rfk,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:58:04 2015 UTC,"Holding to search actually was something you could do initially as well as double tap, but lots of people complained it was too slow, without knowing you could double tap, so I removed it to reduce confusion.  Assuming there isn't an opposition to it I could easily put that back."

PixelDungeon,3cjisz,Natefromthe508,3,Wed Jul 8 12:03:46 2015 UTC,Did you use an upgrade scroll on either of them? Upgrade scrolls have a 1/(item level before upgrade) chance of removing the enchantment when used on armour or weapons.
PixelDungeon,3cjisz,Spiderant,5,Wed Jul 8 12:14:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I did. Crap I didn't know that. I learn something new about PD every day
PixelDungeon,3cjisz,Spiderant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is so much depth to it, it's great.  I'm not really sure why it does it, for balance I guess, but in really it just means you have to save your scroll of weapon enchant until you have already used a satisfactory amount of scroll on it, which can be most of the way through the game already."
PixelDungeon,3cjisz,DumbMuscle,4,Wed Jul 8 12:25:20 2015 UTC,"That's the chance of keeping the enchantment. So you'll always keep it up to +2, have a 50% chance of losing it from +2 to +3, and a 2/3 chance of losing it from +3 to +4, etc."

PixelDungeon,3ckhcn,eridal,3,Wed Jul 8 16:48:29 2015 UTC,potions of liquid flame were actually tweaked to spread flames in a 3x3 grid due to situations like these. You can throw the potion at the tile just to the right of the bookshelf and that will set the shelf on fire.
PixelDungeon,3ckhcn,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"No, this makes perfect sense.  I'm assuming you're tapping right on the bookshelf. The potion will then fly perfectly diagonally. Objects, like thrown weapons and creatures, cannot go into walls, so they will land on the space in front. The space in front here is chasm. However, thrown weapons can fly into creatures, so they will land ON the tile the creature on, disappear, and damage the creature."
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,RolainTheVariable,12,Wed Jul 8 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"As is often said on some of my more frequented subs, the solution is simple: GIT GUD   Wraiths have, as you've noticed, very high evasion, but only 1 hp. What this means is, if you use a wand it will guaranteed kill them (wands cannot miss). Similarly, a surprise attack cannot miss. So, if you go into a door then walk away from it, when the wraith opens the door and steps in, you can hit it for an instant kill. As you get better at this, you can loot graves with basically impunity. Also, when you open a grave, wraiths will spawn on the 4 tiles around you. But, if you have those tiles covered, then they cannot spawn. So open graves against walls/in corners. This is a question difficult to answer quickly. There are a variety of factors that may impede you. I will answer just about the fight with goo itself- if you are playing regular pixel dungeon, then throw down an earthseed and step on it (DONT move from this tile or you'll lose the buff). The armor gain will effectively neutralize goo's attacks and last long enough for you to almost guaranteed kill him. Ideally you should have the seed on water so that corrosive ooze doesn't hurt you, and goo won't be on water so he doesn't heal. They may have nerfed this though. The other classes are viable, but if you are a beginner, stick to warrior."
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,Eris_Omnisciens,3,Wed Jul 8 05:20:56 2015 UTC,"For wraiths if you can get behind a door and surprise attack them it's an automatic kill. They only have one health so if you can land a hit they die, and surprise attacks always land. They work around corners too."
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,ekerstens,3,Wed Jul 8 04:31:01 2015 UTC,"If I knew of anyways to record my screen to show for videos I might make some videos on how to get past earlier levels, but I don't know of any software that does that. Maybe even something that streams. As far as wraiths are concerned, surprise them in doors. Don't get cornered. There are many ways of softening the goo up, and I could spend all day talking about them."
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,omegajourney,6,Wed Jul 8 05:06:07 2015 UTC,There are many ways of softening the goo up   But.. but.. Goo is already soft ...
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,gohjohn,3,Wed Jul 8 05:10:15 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for vanilla as I have not played it.  However, the other variants are hard.  That said, just give it some time.  You will pick up tricks.   Ignore unless you have a wand or high dodge/absorb. Nope.  Most runs of mine die at or before goo.  Tips for goo.  Start with an AoE potion if you have one from a distance.  Fight while youre in water, but goo is not. My favorite class is rogue.  Warrior gets a great boost at first, but I like the rogues dodge chance if I can't get a good set of armor.  Mages in vanilla suck.  They suck less in variants, but the other classes are buffed as well so it's a wash.   General tips.  Fight in hallways and just outside doors of rooms to minimize damage.  The spear stinks.  It does more damage, but is slower.  Unless you get an enchanted one it's not worth it.  You are weak at first, and you will get attacked more when using it because of it's slow speed rating.  Don't use potions found lying in the dungeon (not dropped from kills) until you have explored the floor.  If there is a special room, the potion needed will be on that floor.  If you come across the living statues, inspect them first.  It will tell you what type of weapon they have.  Save food until you are starving.  Use any ranged weapons you have to soften targets.  Even if you aren't strong enough to use them effectively it will help."

PixelDungeon,3cihvt,DumbMuscle,2,Wed Jul 8 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"For the goo:  Save your upgrade scrolls, you want some scale (or plate) armour, upgraded to +3 if possible. If you get set on fire, use the scrolls before moving, but otherwise wait until you either get good armour, or are about to go to l5.  Do the ghosts quest and get armour from it - but get your strength up first if possible. It's much more valuable than a better weapon at this stage.   Find a place where you can stand in water, on an earth root seed, and the goo is standing on land. Equip your best armour (doesn't matter if it's too heavy, you're not going to be moving). Don't move from that spot once the fight starts or you'll lose the buff.    Use poison and/or fire seeds if you can to add more damage to the goo. You need to do this when you pull it, since it needs to move onto the square (and you don't want to move). Flaming potions may also be useful (poison gas is much more useful for later bosses, and worth saving).  Use healing potions if you need to. If you've not identified them yet, it's probably the one you have most of.   If you have a good wand, it may do more damage than your weapon. Use it when it has charges."

PixelDungeon,3cihvt,AimlessZealot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"the goo regenerates in water, so that's why you want to keep it on dry land. It's best you stand in water to wash off any goo that remains on you, if not it'll do damage over time like poison."
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,TabascoOysters,2,Wed Jul 8 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"Avoid/Ignore them unless you have a wand or a serious advantage with armor. They're not worth killing. Gather, gather, gather. Sit on health potions and be prepared to be careful in that fight. Mages are rarely enjoyable to play because they are at such a seeming disadvantage to the others. People flock to warrior because it requires the least careful play to survive. The other two are a matter of using distance and corners effectively early on imho."
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,willis81808,2,Wed Jul 8 04:29:02 2015 UTC,"I just played again. I got SO close to killing the goo. I was kindve disappointed, I had an ungraded lightning spear and upgraded leather armor :("
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,Hecateus,2,Wed Jul 8 04:34:42 2015 UTC,"My strategy with the wraiths is to go behind a door. I think it's a guaranteed hit. Have them in the doorway. They only have 1 hit point too, I think."

I started during the Beta development phase.  Re Raiths...Door ways are your friend.  Re Goo.  Stand in water where you have an Earth Seed planted, burn the doorway the Goo is tricked to stand in."
PixelDungeon,3cihvt,JoeLithium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:15:50 2015 UTC,"As many have said, if something had just walked through a door, you do a surprise attack which always hits. Very useful. You also do a surprise attack if the monster couldn't see you before. Most often this will be if there is a single bump, and it follows you around it.  Save your food until you are starving and down a few points, say a third. You heal 5 when you eat, and then heal over time.  Be careful about using weapons or armour that are too heavy. There are big penalties. Moving slowly (but not attacking slowly) for armour and missing more and attacking slowly for weapons.  If you can, fill up you dew vital rather than using then when you find them, they will help you more.  Goo is tough. I win the game a decent percentage of the time (maybe 20) but when I die it's usually to Goo or crabs."

PixelDungeon,3cejfk,mrfluffleupagus,6,Thu Jul 9 04:02:32 2015 UTC,I took that criticism to heart and decided to spend some time trying to communicate it better. It happened to offer me the chance to add in some chinese characters (one of the running gags in the design is that China's impact upon the future is felt in a variety of society-shifting ways). Here's the new set: http://imgur.com/ZIMramU
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,graspee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:23:43 2015 UTC,Those look much better. Very neo futuristic looking.
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,graspee,0,Thu Jul 9 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"Those guns are really awful, sorry. The one on the left in particular has odd pixels everywhere.

PixelDungeon,3cejfk,Omen267901,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"You know, since you had such a strong reaction to the guns (probably the last object I really spent any time on before passing out) I decided to do a second pass over them and I'm inclined to agree with you. I was very sloppy with both lighting and with cleaning up alpha channel mistakes that I'd made. I went through and redid a lot of the spriting for it.

PixelDungeon,3cejfk,mrfluffleupagus,2,Thu Jul 9 10:22:48 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the original a lot more.  The grey/silvery barrel running underneath the gun, the piece around the trigger and the red lights in a clear descending order all made it look like a weapon of quality. The new one almost looks like a toy.  The ice blaster however is alright, in my opinion."
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:49 2015 UTC,"I am sorry if I was too critical of the guns but if I'm being honest, while they look better in that there's no random out of place pixels, the guns still look ""messy"". In fact looking at the other sprites too, they look messy in the same way but just not quite as bad as the guns because the guns are at that 45 degree angle.    Were you trying to make pixel art or just small sprites ? I'm used to making and looking at pixel art and these sprites look as though you somehow designed the sprites with a certain resolution and then rotated or moved them or filtered them in some way at a resolution twice the size which caused whatever paint package you were using to insert colours, detail and pixels that weren't there to start with."
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,mrfluffleupagus,2,Thu Jul 9 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"Small sprites definitely and not true pixel art -- the pictures that I'm showing are doubled in resolution with nearest neighbor just to make them more visible but I did not base them on a rotated/filtered base design. I probably should have been clear about the NN 2x since for people counting the pixels themselves, it would be fairly meaningful."
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,Omen267901,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:14:04 2015 UTC,Sorry then- I'm just so used to looking at pixel art I judged them as if they were supposed to be pixel art.

PixelDungeon,3cejfk,OldManLaughingBull,5,Thu Jul 9 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"So, since people have taken such an interest in my work within the next day or so I'll be creating a new thread explaining how I'll be documenting my progress since reddit threads get a bit.... messy.  In the meantime my daily update:  So, I have spent most of the last day rewriting code to use higher resolution assets. I've shifted my tile size to 32x32 which plays very well with the newer items I've been showing, but it also means that first batch of characters that I worked on were... well... useless. Scaling them up to double size wasn't going to come out very well. As a result, I went back to traditional pixel art technique and redrew them by hand before scanning it in and spiriting them. Sofar I've just laid down the design for Soldier but since I had the time, I decided to make it possible to select a gender rather than just always be male. I may also add a race option as well. My thought is to make it a left-edge/right-edge control scheme during Agent Selection.  Here's two examples of my recent work:  After / Before Soldier sprites with various scales to show how they match up.  Side-by-side example of the new male vs female soldier sprites at 3x size"
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,Bohdanski,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:08:44 2015 UTC,"The new soldier looks great; The added detail really does wonders. I'm also happy to see gender options, something I've always wanted in PD.  Would races be purely cosmetic or another layer of complexity to character selection similar to MMOs? I assume the former but wasn't sure."
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,JoshuMertens,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:58:03 2015 UTC,I have been thinking about that but the two real holdouts have been (A) it would be difficult to fit it in the interface and (B) customization encourages players to think of their character as more permanent. Neither is a total no-go and I may see about adding it in the long run.
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,JoshuMertens,2,Fri Jul 10 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I entirely agree with the second sentiment as plenty of traditional roguelikes offer quite in depth character creation and even further building once in game (ADOM, ToME, CoQ, DCSS etc). But I understand.  It's not something I even particularly care about, I was just curious. :P"
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,FlyingShisno,2,Fri Jul 10 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"on, I'm sorry. I think I mis-explained myself. What I meant is that Pixel Dungeon does not really encourage attachment to a specific character and that I think that makes it better suit a mobile audience who might have a character be created, live, and die an eventful death in a single sitting.  I think you are totally right that Roguelikes are often more personal and invested experiences and I am still trying to figure out where I want to strike the balance between an invested Roguelike and an easy-to-pick-up mobile ready game. Heck, I may fork my build in the long run just to address that."
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,FlyingShisno,2,Sat Jul 11 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, I understand. You're right, even though it is a roguelike by simply being on a mobile device you've got to design around that (for the masses at least). While I myself would love for it to have the depth of desktop roguelikes that'd probably scare off a lot of people.  If you ever decide to do that you've got my vote for sure but I understand if you don't. I'm not a game maker myself, just a roguelike enthusiast... but I assume balancing two games would be a lot of extra work. :P"
PixelDungeon,3cejfk,Ketsui,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:39:05 2015 UTC,Perhaps make a separate build where character & lore development and time investment is greater for people with more time. Possibly even for the PC?

PixelDungeon,3cejfk,redsky1397,10,Wed Jul 8 05:27:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of varied stuff including:   A randomized storyline with ""logs"" and other findables mixed into the world. A large ""surface"" level to start on that may have multiple stairways down to different sub-areas. A different combat system more cued towards ranged being the standard and melee being the ""exception"". Some systems aimed at providing unique mechanics that make the game interesting Possibly a few very lite multiplayer elements in the form of competitive and cooperative modes (but not playing in the same dungeon... my plans are weird). A whole new set of items, abilities, and artifacts."

PixelDungeon,3cf2er,IntrinsicPalomides,2,Tue Jul 7 12:21:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, so first thing : your armor is enough to finish the game, do not upgrade it anymore.  What you can do is upgrade your axe with every scrolls you can find. If you upgrade it to +6 or +7, that's generally enough to win. Just dump your two scrolls of upgrade on it, and never look back. Dump every scrolls you'll find on it. The only exception is if you find a tier5 weapon (War Hammer or Glaive) and you still have a +3 axe. In this case, maybe you'll have a choice to make as to which weapon you'll win the game with.  Ok, so you have a Horn of Plenty : this is a really good artifact that help you get a lot of food : equip it, and if it is cursed, go buy a remove curse from a merchant. Then, dump all the food you can find in it, and keep the artifact equiped. It will fill with food over time, and every time you eat, you heal. That's a really good artifact for warriors.  The next step is to fill your dew vial and BLESS your Ankh with it. This way, if you die, the Ankh will respawn you with your stuff. If, however, the ankh is not blessed, you'll respawn without your equipment.  After that, the goal is to amass the maximum number of Mind Vision and Invisibility potions, and at least 3 Magic Mapping scrolls : they will become handy when you'll be in the last levels."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,EstherDarkish,2,Tue Jul 7 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this except for the horn. If he's at level 11 already, he'll be lucky to fill it to level ten by the time he's at the demon halls. I think if you're not getting that thing to 9 or 10 its really not worth it, especially over a ring of haste or ethereal chains. If he were on a earlier level I would completely agree with you it just seems a bit late at this point."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:53:58 2015 UTC,"Even at level 5, that's still a really good artifact, and because of the sandals of nature, it is possible to have some Bland Fruits : just infuse them with whatever seed you have, then dump the fruit in the horn, the horn will be happy (and so will you)."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,EstherDarkish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"Never thought about using blandfruit, good idea."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:14:51 2015 UTC,"The problem i was having with the dew vial was actually being full HP to even fill it. I actually only found out what the vial did on this run heh or it prolly would have been 10/10 a lot earlier.  Finding food in general seems a pain after the Goo boss, unless i've just been unlucky."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,MoronLessOff,2,Tue Jul 7 18:10:08 2015 UTC,"If you find a Well of Health, throw your vial into it.  It will fill completely."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,EstherDarkish,2,Wed Jul 8 15:36:08 2015 UTC,"Some other tips :  From experience, it's better to eat from the Horn of Plenty when it has at least +4 food in it. Otherwise, you'll be hungry every 2 seconds.  The Ring of Haste is nice and all, but not as overpowered as in regular Pixel Dungeon. I'd still equip it anyday over the Chains and Sandals.  You should sell the venomous spear and curare darts.  Don't rush the levels (except for the Demon Halls), every level, you need to be CurrentLevel+1 before going down. At the moment you are on the 16th floor, so kill some things to be level 17 before going down to the 17th floor.  If you find a room with piranhas, it means there is an Invisibility potion in the level. If you find only one un-identified potion, that means it is it.  If the bats are not too rough, try to hunt them : they drop Healing Potions.  If you find another ring of haste or another battle axe, do not sell them : they will become handy with the Blacksmith.  Best of luck !"
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:48:20 2015 UTC,Haha we disagree on everything. I think he should keep the curare darts because you can surprise attack dwarf monks with them and always paralyze them.
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,EstherDarkish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:00:20 2015 UTC,"With hit and run and the door trick, you can manage the dwarf monks, if you do not make the mistake of runing back when your weapon is on the floor.  But that's a fair enough idea : i'll try the curare darts on them in my next run. Thank you :)"
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:06:43 2015 UTC,Yeah it's mostly just nice because you can get two or three hits on them before they can attack which is usually a kill.
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"Cheers for the tips! and to confirm i'm lvl16, on floor 12 atm."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,EstherDarkish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"Okay you've got a damn good loadout first of all. Unfortunately you can only equip two rings/artifacts so if I were you I would sell most of the artifacts. I think as any other class I would keep the sandals and the either the chains or ring or haste. Both will distance you from the enemy so you can use your wand from range as much as possible.   In terms of upgrades, your armor at level five is good enough to not upgrade again. Throw all of your upgrades into the axe.   Oh and use the book to become a gladiator, combos will really benefit you in the later levels."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,2,Tue Jul 7 13:40:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure selling artifacts is the way to go : they are always handy, and if you need them, just equip them. The Sandals are REALLY GOOD if you find a wand of regrowth, and they will help you get a lot of seeds in levels with a lot of grass.  The firebolt range is nice, but it will not be enough to finish the game with a warrior. It is not as overpowered as in regular Pixel Dungeon, and you do not have natural mage buffs to recharge it, meaning it will be almost useless against powerfull mobs. But keep it of course, that's still a really good wand."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,EstherDarkish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:39 2015 UTC,"The problem with not selling is that it takes up inventory space, and towards the end game those slots become really important. I always just pick two and stick with them because the more use an artifact gets the better it is, and I'd rather have two great ones than four okay ones."
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,2,Tue Jul 7 13:57:49 2015 UTC,Yes. But you can also sell some levitation potions that are useless and will never be used. Or you can dump stuff on the ground when you are missing space.  What is the point of giving up the potential benefit of having the artifact ?
PixelDungeon,3cf2er,Gorbonzo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"Having excess equippable items just seems like a bad idea to me because in my experience, every time I actually need the item, its when I'm with an enemy and I don't want to give up two hits just to equip it."

[edit] This has to be tested, because I couldn't try this more then once.  Also it seems like the enemies on the Shadow Yog level respawn also after killing all Shadow Yogs. Even after killing all enemies on this level, there is no exit and no entrance on this level and the only things you can do is to kill more rats or to use the Amulet of Yendor (maybe add a badge for this and a special ending)."

I fully intent to hold up Rogue's legacy like vanilla PD does, but if something is unfun it should be tweaked/removed.  For example, I'm currently working on some new traps, including a few that will be exclusive to the lategame. One of these traps is intended to just straight up blast the player within an inch of their life. For fairness reasons, it won't be hidden as it would be just downright unfun and cruel to have a player spontaneously die with no real counterplay options that late in the game."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:58:46 2015 UTC,I think the polymorph should also have a chance to backfire and turn the player into a sheep with reduced HP and Armor for the duration.

PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,00-Evan,2,Mon Jul 6 19:25:33 2015 UTC,"It is random, some of those random effects can be very, very bad for you. This is the only immediately game-ending one though.  Polymorphing can be really great though, imagine landing that on one of yog's fists."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,eridal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"seems not fair, it should not work on bosses, or drop the key .. otherwise there's no much incentive to use the cursed wands."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,00-Evan,5,Mon Jul 6 20:20:17 2015 UTC,"You're right it isn't fair.  Like I said, cursed wands are pretty chaotic, for bosses especially I don't want to just nullify all the super negative effects as I don't really want using cursed wands to be a viable strategy. Cursed wands should be a sort of panic button against bosses, on average the the effect won't work in your favour.  Remember, these are cursed items. I like the idea of fun curse effects which give more variety and can be used to your advantage in some cases, but at the end of the day curses should not be seen as helpful."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,jengelke,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"As a question, I saw that a cursed wand could teleport you to another floor. Can this happen in a boss room and ""lock"" the player out, screwing up the run that way too?"
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"Teleportation doesn't work on boss floors, so in that case nothing would happen."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,eridal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"yep, I agree that cursed wands should play against the player .. but I'm trying to say that this is like breaking the game.  It's not the same like when you can only move but die .. we know we had gotten into that trouble, but even then the game wont lose that continuum that in this case is lost.  isn't?"
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,mrfluffleupagus,3,Mon Jul 6 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"Nobody is forcing use to use cursed wands against bosses, in fact, you shouldn't... so I'm not really sure I follow your reasoning.  Doing something you shouldn't be doing should come with consequences."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,eridal,-1,Mon Jul 6 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"yes, agree .. and you should have like terrible consequences, but IMHO breaking the game continuum is something that should not be allowed  one thing is to face an really uphill situation, another one is hitting a dead end  it destroys the trust of the player on the game"
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,00-Evan,3,Tue Jul 7 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason why I gave cursed wands rare effects was so those effects could, occasionally, break the game in such a way. For example, it's rare but there is literally an effect that pops up a ""fatal error, this application with self-distruct"" message and then crashes the app. Yes, it saves first, i'm not that cruel.  in 99% of cases I would agree with you, but I wanted to have a little fun and make an exception."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,hpp3,3,Tue Jul 7 01:35:41 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, nethack is a very unforgiving game with multiple nontransparent instadeaths, and a lot of ""cursed/confused items do random weird stuff"" type effects. However, despite the overall harshness of the game and the number of features and interactions, nethack still tries extremely hard to prevent the game from being unwinnable. The game might kill you instantly without warning, but it still doesn't want you to be in a position where you are still alive but the game is unwinnable."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,mrfluffleupagus,2,Tue Jul 7 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree. You want a punishment for making a bad choice removed but that's something present in nearly every roguelike since the genres invention and where does it end exactly?  If a cursed wand shouldn't be able to end your run, then why should traps? what about using potions poorly? A very clear design choice of the genre is learning from your mistakes each run and not doing it again the next to do better."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,eridal,-1,Tue Jul 7 00:50:14 2015 UTC,"seems not fair, it should not work on bosses, or drop the key .. otherwise there's no much incentive to use the cursed wands."
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,fistsforall,3,Mon Jul 6 20:20:18 2015 UTC,"I usually do a test zap of wands to see if they're cursed, especially since I read about this happening to someone else.  It only seems unfair because wands aren't equipped. Would you be willing to used cursed equipment, weapons, or artifacts on a boss willingly?"
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,v3xx,2,Mon Jul 6 21:46:44 2015 UTC,Ah so this would explain why everything I had equipped suddenly became cursed?
PixelDungeon,3cc1lo,00-Evan,4,Mon Jul 6 20:53:22 2015 UTC,"That would be another one of the negative effects, yes. A rare one too."

PixelDungeon,3canp3,bigDon_001,6,Mon Jul 6 13:03:29 2015 UTC,"this is a special room type, you need to drop in from above. Look for a room on the previous depth that has half its floor missing."

That pile of bones will hold multiple items, including the key to the door."

PixelDungeon,3c9865,Always_A_Gen_Behind,3,Mon Jul 6 02:04:10 2015 UTC,"REVIEW POST  1) Looting broke cash. I just sat and let mimics (attempt to) beat the crap out of me, and my money count explains what that did... and that's after buying out every shop's heal pots and scrolls.  2) Champions. I had plenty of close encounters with the ""vamperic"" (fix yo spellin') champions, especially the dwarven golems.  3) Venoms two strunk, pl0x nurf. Once you get level 10~ venom, you can hit once and kite mobs to death. Probably would have broke the game more if I was a freerunner.  4) I LOVE YOU. Regardless of whatever negatives I say, thank you for giving the players an option with degradation.  5) I really like the dualswords. The double hit can whoop ass for first strikes.  6) Necroblade <3. I toyed around with it in previous runs, and it seemed cool. Free upgrades and heals from killing crap was awesome.  7) Necroblade suggestions: raise the costs, and boost the cap to 200 or 250, and make champions worth 1.5x souls, and/or make stronger monsters worth more.  Overall, this is probably the superior over shattered (only other modded i've played), especially with the confusing-as-fuck wand rework. Stay awesome, BilboDev"

The mage certainly is a fair bit more complex, and I'm aware he's no longer nearly as easy to pick up as he was before. I want to improve that somewhat but the core changes will stay.

I've beaten every other mod, most on all the characters, (except skillfull on it's hardest setting... it's just retarded hard).

PixelDungeon,3c56uc,SariusDev,3,Sun Jul 5 05:11:24 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Never thought someone would ever find my mods :)   the work at PD-ICE has been stopped because of some issues, but all of its changes were also made in shattered-ice-dungeon. The main difference between these two projects is that shattered-ice-dungeon already contains the wand rework, but the graphics are the same. The idea for pd-ice and shattered-ice-dungeon is from Nels (github name: ndachel), who is also my teampartner at shattered-ice-dungeon and the creator of the original pd-ice project. the work at shattered-ice-dungeon is still going on and you can also see the currently made changes and  important future changes in TASKS.md which os also linked in the README.md file in the second or third line. the basic idea behind pd-ice and shattered-ice-dungeon is that you no longer play in the sewers, caves etc but in a forest etc. We also want to implement new stuff acording to mobs and items. multiplayer-pd could be a bit hard to code (this project was created yesterday) and also very hard to find a good solution according to the turn based system of pixel dungeon. On this project I am working together with /u/MrLolEthan .   If anyone wants to try out the current version of shattered-ice-dungeon please feel free to comment here or write me a pm.  You can also make suggestions, but I will first talk with Nels about them, before they are implemented.  [edit] if someone wants to help creating new tilesets etc please also comment here or pm me, because Nels and I can need a bit help with this (because the sprites are limited to 16x16 pixel).  [edit 2] has its own post now and you will find the download link in this post."

PixelDungeon,3c3j5x,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:31:30 2015 UTC,At least not in near future... Too much mimics will be not fun.  Some players suggest even more evil things ( https://pp.vk.me/c629305/v629305536/24f/lMhPA5j8ucU.jpg (text in Russian but picture idea is clear) )
PixelDungeon,3c3j5x,dachhack,3,Sat Jul 4 19:41:47 2015 UTC,Oh wow. That IS evil.
PixelDungeon,3c4or0,ekolis,4,Sat Jul 4 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"Warriors are less accurate and deal less damage with missile weapons. As for wands, it's probably because they're rare anyways and require upgrade scrolls that a warrior could be spending on melee weapons instead, which would be a much better investment, given the specializations you can get from the book of mastery. You can still reforge your short sword in Shattered. Really, the only confusing equipment enchantments are grim and anti-entropy, and you find out what that does pretty quickly. The effects are pretty easy to figure out by yourself anyways - for example, charming armour enchantment means a chance for the enemy to stop hitting you b/c charm, metabolism is going to have something to do with hunger and healing, stuff like that."
PixelDungeon,3c4or0,TheCanadianAlligator,0,Sat Jul 4 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"I've never bothered to get mathy about it but I'd assume damage, seeing as accuracy is based off strength; Possibly both though. Because balance/fun... Who would want to play such a severely gimped  and limited character? Yes Intentional. It only takes about 30 seconds to figure out what they do anyway though, so I don't know if you can really call that mystery."
PixelDungeon,3c4or0,mrfluffleupagus,5,Sat Jul 4 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"For #2, the reforge option has not been removed.  I'm unsure why some people seem to think it has when I have made no changes at all to it. The reforge option only pops up when your shortsword is +1 or greater, and then you can use that to give +1 to a different weapon. This is the exact same as how it is in vanilla."
PixelDungeon,3c4or0,00-Evan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:35:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, right, I always forget that the option is missing when it doesn't have any pluses. Maybe it should always be there, but be grayed out or pop up some sort of message if it's not upgraded? Otherwise it's not all that obvious how to do it, since you first have to upgrade the sword, then acquire another weapon, then find the reforge button (which wasn't there before you upgraded)..."
PixelDungeon,3c4or0,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:32:29 2015 UTC,"I could have sworn it wasn't there, my mistake. I'm not sure why I thought that then..  I must admit I pretty much never play the Warrior, he's incredibly lacking now (imo) when compared to the changes you've made to the other 2 classes, it probably just stuck in my head hearing it elsewhere."
PixelDungeon,3c4or0,00-Evan,2,Sat Jul 4 19:42:35 2015 UTC,tbh the only class I'm truly happy with right now is the mage. Rogue is almost there and he benefits from utility a lot so other changes will indirectly bring him up to snuff. I have plans for the huntress and warrior.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,portezbie,2,Sat Jul 4 21:39:30 2015 UTC,Wraiths spawned from graves drop upgrade and infusion scrolls. Also filling your dew vial to 100 allows you to bless which randomly upgrades your gear. AND you can water the ground around you using the dew vial which grows back grass for you to find more dew. AND the black smith will move all the upgrades from any one item to any other item if you collect a bunch of dark gold before forging.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,dachhack,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This definitely sounds like what I've been missing. I knew about the wraiths, but not the other stuff."
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,Omen267901,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, you might want to make some of this info clearer in the game.  Any other suggestions got actual strategy?  Thanks again"
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,gohjohn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:48:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. A lot of these changed behaviors (like wraiths and the troll blacksmith) aren't really explained. Many players would never figure it out probably.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,Omen267901,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:18:35 2015 UTC,Do you think its generally a good idea for games to have everything explained?
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,Lentil-Soup,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:27:04 2015 UTC,Not everything but still a good bit.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,redsky1397,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:58:41 2015 UTC,Absolutely nothing is explained in the original.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,dachhack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"how DOES the blacksmith work. as in what amount of gold will effect it, and in what way?"
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,EstherDarkish,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:23:41 2015 UTC,The first upgrade is for sure. After that the chance of each upgrade is at least 50%. Each piece of black gold adds 5% to the chance of upgrade. Each upgrade try reduces the upgrade chance by 10%.   So let's go on a math journey....  If you finish the blacksmith quest with 20 black gold and melt down a +8 ring of force to enhance a +7 wand of firebolt you would get the first upgrade at 100% chance. Then the next upgrade at 150% chance. The third at 140%. The fourth at 130%. The fifth at 120%. The sixth at 110%. The seventh at 100%. The eighth at 90%. It would keep going with a floor of 50%.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,dachhack,2,Mon Jul 6 01:11:29 2015 UTC,"So, you can combine a wand with a ring to enhance the wand ? That's so messed up... You should really explain this. Like the fact that if you try to enhance a +13 armor with a +0 armor (non cursed), the blacksmith will refuse and tell you your perfectly nice +0 armor is garbage, that's just bizarre and counterintuitive, because every other Pixel Dungeon game/mod is behaving differently."
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,redsky1397,2,Mon Jul 6 08:53:08 2015 UTC,Good points. I'll add some text that help make things clearer.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,dachhack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:29:07 2015 UTC,so ideally if you want to combine a 13 and a 13 item you should have 50 gold? (give or take). can you use the black smith more than once?
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,redsky1397,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:38:22 2015 UTC,It's like 32 gold to move over 13 at no less than 100% chance per.
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,redsky1397,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:37:29 2015 UTC,you could always just get the golden spork ;D
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,dachhack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:32:06 2015 UTC,Huh?
PixelDungeon,3c53j6,aaronchi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"the golden spork is a hidden quest item in the game that is overpowered as hell. These are the instructions to get it (copy and pasted): Don't open any of the Rat Kings chests. Defeat Tengu then return to the Rat King and talk to him. Go back to level 9 and find and defeat the Bandit King. Get the normal spork from the Bandit King Take the spork back to the Rat King and he will trade you for the Golden Spork. I like to save the blacksmith reward to apply upgrades to the golden spork. Things to note are dont go to caves first (mistake that i once made), and dont use scrolls of magic infusion as the power is in the enchantment."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,gamba11,2,Sat Jul 4 18:48:00 2015 UTC,Rogue runs are usually decided by wether you find a high tier weapon early in the game or you don't
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,Magicokito,3,Sat Jul 4 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"I find it quite the opposite. The cloak and stealth damage mechanic combo is heavily abusable and I can do better with significantly worse gear compared to a warrior.  Bosses in particular. The goo for example, stealth cancels its charge canceling out the main threat of it + free bonus damage hits."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,mrfluffleupagus,3,Sat Jul 4 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"This is generally the best answer. Doing well with the rogue involves being crafty with the cloak.  At some point I may tweak how his starting dagger works to more encourage people to depend on the cloak and being sneaky, but it wouldn't be an overall buff."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,00-Evan,2,Sat Jul 4 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"Mhm, I don't like to sound like I'm telling people ""no you're wrong"". I think people just have a hard time learning to play a different way, really.  If you try to play him like a warrior it obviously won't work out so well (usually). Gotta take advantage of his gimmicks."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,mrfluffleupagus,2,Sat Jul 4 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"Well I was refering to the surprise attack mechanic rogues revolve around when I said getting a high tier weapon early, since you can't get too much critical benefit from a 5 average damage weapon."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,Magicokito,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:21:13 2015 UTC,can u make the dagger uhhh........  make it like a twin dagger? or something unique for the rouge? ... just a suggestion :3
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,IceDemon15,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:14:49 2015 UTC,"The rogue already has a unique item, but when I rework weapons there will be some which thematically and mechanically fit with sneaky playstyles."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,00-Evan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:43:29 2015 UTC,Any chance you could give the Rogue his own unique armor for a starting item rather than cloak? it sucks that an acc slot is automatically needed as one class basically making it a choice between playing as the class is intended or using the gear that actually makes your character stronger such as rings or other artifacts.
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,jestertiko,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:21:03 2015 UTC,I'm a bit undecided on that. Ultimately if I want the rogue to have a free slot I can just make the cloak not need to be equipped in a misc slot. There would be balance considerations though.
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,00-Evan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:40:18 2015 UTC,"I really think it would be worth it since there are certain combinations that need both slots like ring of might and ring of force, or having a ring of wealth and a ring of furor/might/accuracy/evasion and having to decide between higher chance of hp potions or better combat outcomes. Just my two cents"
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,jestertiko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:12:28 2015 UTC,"at the same time though the cloak is already an artifact which has its own synergies, and you certainly aren't required to use it all the time as a rogue."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:14:01 2015 UTC,True true
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,jestertiko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:19:56 2015 UTC,I completely second that. It sucks that we can only equip one more ring/artifact. It was my favourite class but now i feel it's the weakest among the three classic classes (I dont play huntress).
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,Kultissim,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:41:18 2015 UTC,"I've found that once you've unlocked free runner the rogue becomes one of the most powerful classes in the game. In general, get used to dragging monsters through multiple doors, striking only when they first step onto a door tile (sneak attack bonus) and using the cloak if you become cornered."
PixelDungeon,3c4kon,aronnax512,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"Rogue is beyond broken. It is so ridiculously overpowered. Assassin (if you can) -> lure to door -> bonus dmg+accuracyx1 -> pop cloak -> bonus dmg+accuracyx2.   With a t4 or t5 weapon, you'll be 1-2 hit ko'ing pretty much everything pretty quick.   If you find an axe, glaive or hammer early enough, you can dump literally all your upgrade scrolls into it and ignore armor completely. You can 1hko every boss in the game. You can safely use a weapon 2 STR below the recommended. The accuracy bonus from surprise attacks is ridiculous, and rogue accuracy in general seems comparatively excellent.   If you don't find a good weapon early, just wait. If you have to, use your dagger until you do. If you find scale or plate, upgrade those until you find a good weapon. Don't worry about enchantment (no enchantment is worth not-leveling up a weapon, except maybe vampiric in some situations).  Prepare to give zero fucks about anything and 1hko anything that inconveniences you..."

PixelDungeon,3c0vik,HammBerger3,2,Sat Jul 4 02:53:46 2015 UTC,Lol nice
PixelDungeon,3c0vik,Nawel_Do,2,Sat Jul 4 03:12:43 2015 UTC,"It depends how you are playing. When you're having an unlucky run you can just start a new one and it will not count as a lose. Also the first time you beat the game it takes a lot of tries especially if you don't go to the wiki and learn by yourself. If you're trying to win with challenges you will die a lot, melee classes are more relient on luck, etc etc.   I think that winrate has no meaning in PD. I Have around 20% winrate now but i died a lot to challenges, died a lot before winning the game once and i don't delete a run. Also I'm playing sniper 90% of the time which mean i can't lose just because I found nothing better than a dagger : Sniper starts with her main weapon and don't need to keep scrolls of Upgrade to use them later. Also after the wand rework there is A LOT of usefull items for her and you almost always find one. Even fireblast is usefull to kite xD  P.S : IMO that's why Sniper is the best classe in the game. She's not frustrating because when you die, most of the time it's more your fault than ""unlucky"". After the wand rework, the Mage is also going this way which is great ! Evan is doing a great job"
PixelDungeon,3c0vik,HuhDude,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:57:57 2015 UTC,I think I'm riding at about 20% for Shattered. And 100% for Sprouted.

PixelDungeon,3c0vik,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:23:07 2015 UTC,"Item degradation is too under-powered (IMO), but everyone plays Shattered, which doesn't have it."
PixelDungeon,3c0vik,MrLolEthan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:56:01 2015 UTC,"While degradation being omitted may have helped Shattered grow, it doesn't help that PD hasn't seen an update since January.

PixelDungeon,3c0vik,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:21:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that was the main reason people played Shattered. I prefer Shattered because of artifacts and the Mage/wand rework. Also, Shattered just feels more refined with the fancy class avatars and stuff."

PixelDungeon,3byb8r,Spiderant,3,Fri Jul 3 04:00:36 2015 UTC,"Wait, using a 18 strength weapon right from the start is possible? I somehow never tried, is there any penalty for using one so early without meeting the strength requirement?"
PixelDungeon,3byb8r,OldManLaughingBull,4,Fri Jul 3 08:13:53 2015 UTC,"You miss, a lot. I think the damage you do is also decreased. But in OPs case it might be plus three or something, making it usable at least."
PixelDungeon,3byb8r,eddykasp,2,Fri Jul 3 11:25:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for clarifying."
PixelDungeon,3byb8r,OldManLaughingBull,4,Fri Jul 3 11:31:54 2015 UTC,"Sneak attacks through doors will still hit every time however, just make sure one hit will kill them or they will geta few attacks in after you swing due to the weapon being too heavy. Most useful with assassin + shadow cloak."
PixelDungeon,3byb8r,Morleen,3,Fri Jul 3 12:58:40 2015 UTC,I was actually an assassin so it was incredibly useful. Though if it didn't one hit them I got whacked four times as punishment for my greed.
PixelDungeon,3byb8r,OldManLaughingBull,2,Fri Jul 3 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"Follow up question to the sneak attack through doors (sorry if this is a bit off topic here...), I always read about these here but I am never sure how it really works. Does this mean I am standing in the door and attack a monster outside the door square? Or does this mean I wait on a monster stepping onto a door, I am waiting on the other side and hit it once it is in the door square? Asking because so far I understood it like the second explanation, but I do every now and then still miss the hit, which makes me wonder if I misunderstood the concept."
PixelDungeon,3byb8r,MrLolEthan,3,Fri Jul 3 13:51:29 2015 UTC,"A surprise attack is when you hit a monster before they notice you. Doors can be used to easily setup a sneak attack position: all you need to do is walk through the door, and when the mob follows you in, it will count as a ""surprise."" The mob can literally be right behind you, and it will still count."

PixelDungeon,3byb8r,eddykasp,3,Fri Jul 3 09:50:30 2015 UTC,TBH I don't think endgame weapons like are really that useful in the first five levels. Unless they're +3 and you can check that and even then you still need put some upgrades in.
PixelDungeon,3byb8r,ayosuke,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:28:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, especially since you don't have the strength to wield the weapons yet."

I used up the dew and it was back to normal difficulty."

PixelDungeon,3bxc04,MrLolEthan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"Like disintegration?, what else would be considered better?  Since It's the staff I could up the lightning now for a future find.  Up against the machine though, I'll need to melee once the wand is done, I can use the chains to keep away, but it keeps healing as it moves."
PixelDungeon,3bxc04,Magicokito,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:59:57 2015 UTC,You can keep him from healing if you move in a way that when he follows you he does not step in a non-active trap tile.
PixelDungeon,3bxc04,MrLolEthan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Disintegration, Fireblast, Venom, Corruption (I believe this would be great for a Battlemage).  Wand of Lightning is really good on water, but only on water. It's also good for Area of Effect damage (hitting nearby enemies, including the Hero)."
PixelDungeon,3bxc04,SGAdventures,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"have you got an earth root seed? If you do chuck 3 into the armour, 2 into the long sword, sit around a corner and just tank him, 2-3 hp pots needed if you're really unlucky! Use the wand to soften things up, but lightning (even with the wands rework) isn't worth dumping tonnes of stuff into. Unless it's your starting staff that has been imbued? Even so, you're clearly not going for a wand type build so need to build standard tank. Although if you choose to dump into the wand you should be able to kite with your chains (what level?) the DM-300 only heals when he walks over a trap so just keep his pathing away from them and you'll be fine. Fighting him by kiting is pretty hairy though, and in your case is only going to be viable if there's lots of water around (extra damage with lightning wand) or you have some recharging scrolls..  Still worth chucking a few into the plate though..  +2 Plate mail isn't what it used to be :P"

PixelDungeon,3bur3w,Natinals,2,Thu Jul 2 08:59:16 2015 UTC,"On my first time killing Tengu and unlocking the Tome of Mastery, I became an Assassin and killed Yog. After killing the two larvae, and with no health left, I planted an herbal healing seed, but the caustic ooze was too strong. I had no healing potions left and a 1/10 dew vial and one piece of food, which I tried consuming before dying.  Maybe my ethereal chains could have saved me, but they were not equipped and I had no idea how far they could pull me.  e: I had +10 rogue cloak, +9 scale armor of anti-entropy (I got greedy with 4 glyphs at the Imp store and should have stuck with the bounce enchantment I got first) +4 battleaxe, +3 wand of fireblast, +2 ring of might, and this was on Shattered"

PixelDungeon,3bp4i1,draskius,4,Wed Jul 1 00:31:45 2015 UTC,Basically shooting through walls and killing things with one or two hits. It was crazy fun. Although I feel like it was a bit too easy at the same time.
PixelDungeon,3bp4i1,Phenixxy,3,Wed Jul 1 00:33:06 2015 UTC,So you can shoot through walls with a staff of disintegration?
PixelDungeon,3bp4i1,gohjohn,3,Wed Jul 1 07:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. The range increases the more you upgrade it. But be careful, I've shot the shopkeeper by mistake from the other side of the map trying to kill a knoll standing next to me."

PixelDungeon,3bp4i1,gohjohn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I did find it difficult trying to clear stages 21-24, even with an upgraded staff it took sometime to kill some monsters."
PixelDungeon,3bp4i1,Magicokito,2,Fri Jul 3 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"While I'm monitoring this combo to make it isn't too good, it's very much intentional that the player use disintegration for sniping.

PixelDungeon,3bpibq,Omen267901,3,Wed Jul 1 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is very refreshing, and I liked the fact that I became reckless in the first levels when I respawn as a bat, running to the bottom and getting to Tengu with only a level 6 bat. I died just after that to a gnoll, and I like the idea that it was only my fault for rushing the easier levels.  What should be the goal ? To finish the game with the lowest critter possible ? I like that idea. And I also like the fact you can finish it easily with some overpowered critters. Each player can find its playstyle.  And yeah, it would be REALLY cool to be able to kill heroes. But it should be something epic. Maybe an idea is that when there is a Hero in your current level, you automatically see him a la Mind vision, and he should wander around, be overpowered and kill stuff. Because you can see him wherever he is, you can dodge him if you are not strong enough.  And another neat stuff would be to be allied with your kin and try to kill the hero this way : that would be so cool to see that the Hero is bashing on your Gnoll friends, and rush into the battle to help them take him down.  Maybe, to make allies with some mobs of your kind, you could ""talk"" to them if you did not try to hurt them, and they would be on your team ? This way, only when you want to take a hero down you can recruit every same-mob-as-you you see."
PixelDungeon,3bpibq,EstherDarkish,2,Wed Jul 1 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"This post is visible. I don't think the other post is required. :)  Regarding the OPness of higher tier classes, I wonder if this is just how PD was designed... In the sense that weapons and armor are really key. And without a tier 4 and 5 weapon and armor, you can't beat the game. I recognise that as an issue and might have to rethink the entire equipment system.  I agree that every mob should be able to beat the game, I plan to give each mob a special active ability for them to rely on to beat the game.   I really like your idea of ascending weapons and armor. It doesn't need to be a actual change of the item (albeit cool), but a unlockable ability based on level perhaps? (Skill trees if possible, but Idk how to code the UI out)  Thanks for the suggestions!  Did you enjoy the run with golem? :)"
PixelDungeon,3bpibq,gohjohn,3,Wed Jul 1 03:30:41 2015 UTC,I think you're missing something that would be very fun with this mod. Fighting heroes! I don't know how hard it would be to code but being able to fight one random hero on every floor or every few floors with increasing levels of strength would be so cool. They could even drop special loot when defeated.

PixelDungeon,3bnmt9,Tehtacticalpanda,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"A few things I've recognized so far:   could you change the description of the berries to point out their effects? Maybe to show this detailed description only if this berry has already been eaten once in this run and before ""identifying"" it, show the old description. It should be suggested somewhere in the game that you get a little reward for killing 100+ enemies on the key levels and how these levels work at all. Also, it seems a little bit confusing the first time, that you get the reward after leaving the key level and not after killing enough enemies. And as /u/EstherDarkish already mentioned, nobody would ever get the reward from the key levels or the spork without reading spoilers, because nobody would try to kill 100+ enemies on the key levels or wouldn't steal the rat king's items without the knowledge about these rewards. A graphic bug I found so far: If you throw a holy hand grenade on a red or yellow dewdrop (maybe also standard dewdrop, but not proofed yet), the dewdrop's sprite is replaced by the grenade's sprite after the grenade exploded.      pictures of the berries' descriptions and the grenade bug     The first three pictures show the berries' descriptions.     Explanation of my actions on the last three pictures (I reproduced the bug for these pictures, so this is not the first time this happened):   (first of these pictures) the dewdrops from a killed special skeleton. (second of these picture) after killing one of the special skeletons from the second key level, I threw a second grenade in the same direction because of another skeleton appearing there (grenade landed on a tile with a dewdrop on it). (third of these pictures) the grenade exploded as it is supposed to be. The dewdrop below was not damaged, but it had the sprite of the grenade and not its own dewdrop sprite.   This happens also with the yellow dewdrops, but I don't know if it also happens with the standard dewdrops.        I have also a few questions according to my current run:   I have set the beacon to the second key level and already left it. So what happens if I use the beacon to return to the key level and would I be able to leave it again? Can it be that the dew upgrades (dew vial blessing) have a limit according to the current depth (was only able to upgrade my items to level 6 with the dew vial before I entered the level after the Goo, after entering it, I was able to upgrade it to level 8 using the dew vial).   [edit: updated formatting]"
PixelDungeon,3bnmt9,Tehtacticalpanda,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'll add some commentary to the berries to help players anticipate what they do. I'm trying to figure out the bomb sprite thing right now and it's a puzzler. Hopefully, I'll get it figured out soon.  I totally forgot about the beacon! I just tweaked it to not allow use on special levels just like on boss levels. I guess you could set the beacon in the dungeon, use the key to go to the special level, then use the beacon to come back. Unlimited trips to the special level! I can't have that!  The Dew Bless limit does go up for each depth you descend.  It's Math.max(5, 5+Math.round(Statistics.deepestFloor/3))  I just changed it to 1+Math.max(5, 5+Math.round(Statistics.deepestFloor/3)) for Mage's for the next release.  Thank you very much for your feedback!"
PixelDungeon,3bnmt9,SariusDev,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"The problem is, that I was able to set the beacon to the key level (which should be a special level?). So I will be stuck in it after I left it once with the key and enter it again using the beacon, won't I?  According to the key:   maybe remove it from the inventory if the current depth changes from the key level depth to another depth. or detect if it was used once and if the current depth changes after the key was used once, remove it from the inventory. or (maybe easiest method) save if a key which is still in the inventory was used once and let the beacon remove all single time used keys if the player uses it (the beacon) to return to another depth"
PixelDungeon,3bnmt9,saese,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:38:36 2015 UTC,I'm just not going to let players set or use the beacon on the special levels (depths > 24). That should do it right?
PixelDungeon,3bnmt9,n00bslyr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, this would prevent players from being stuck on one of the key levels not able to leave it   [edit: did not see that you will also not allow to use the beacon]  , but you have to remove the key from inventory if the player uses the beacon to exit the key level to prevent him from entering it again with the key and using the beacon to leave it. and will also prevent them from entering again."

PixelDungeon,3bmz4q,Hulasikali_Wala,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"I once got up to a +11 ring of force in sprouted PD. Couple that with a +10 ring of might and I'm dealing about 100 damage per hit with no chance of being disarmed :D   After that, I kinda quit sprouted because it was too easy to farm with the dew vial."
PixelDungeon,3bmz4q,erolls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:48:53 2015 UTC,There is a new playtest out. Message dachhack if you'd like to test it. Big changes. =]
PixelDungeon,3bmz4q,broken_long_thumbkey,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the ring of force is, generally, really useful to pair with a ring of might, but a lot less useful on its own.  It just doesn't keep pace that well with a tier 4 or 5 weapon that you upgrade (since those get +4 or +5 damage per scroll and can be enchanted, have innate accuracy bonuses, etc.)  Even a knuckleduster, while doing crap damage, can be enchanted and gets to attack twice.   But I've never taken a ring of force up to sick upgrade levels.  Maybe a +12 ring of force kicks butt."
PixelDungeon,3bmz4q,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"Ring of force scales with both your strength and its own upgrades. This means it does tend to lag behind tier 4/5 gear a bit, especially given that it can't be weighted/enchanted, but its more consistent and doesn't have a strength requirement. If you can get 20+ strength the ring of force starts to get pretty nuts though, as it'll scale right past a tier 5 weapon."
PixelDungeon,3bmz4q,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right.  I haven't quite figured out the ring of force formula, but when I find a ring of might, I pretty much just dump every single upgrade into that forever more and forget about my weapon. I'm not sure if a +20 hammer with 19 strength is better or worse than a +0 hammer with 39 strength, damage-wise, but with the extra 100 hp, things seem to favor the ring.  Especially if you're a rouge type and the strength also helps dodging."
PixelDungeon,3bmz4q,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"I can say that as far as damage is concerned you will deal much more damage with the weapon upgraded, but you're right that there are other benefits which affect the balance."

PixelDungeon,3bmz4q,Leuten,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:07 2015 UTC,"not really, maybe, and yes.  While I understand that it fits thematically, knuckledusters are already in a decent place balance-wise due to their speed and enchants. I'm not too keen on making them much stronger. Currently the ring of force does synergize a bit though as it does add to any weapon's damage a little, and dusters are the fastest."

PixelDungeon,3bgps1,gohjohn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:58:42 2015 UTC,How did you find that many wands? Most I've ever had was 5.
PixelDungeon,3bgps1,Eris_Omnisciens,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"I got really lucky I guess. :P (Note that this is my first game on iOS, so no hero-remains shenanigans.)  Tho the most crucial wands were the early ones. Wand of poison, wand of lightning and wand of teleport. They are not exactly very imba but they helped diversify my attack and defence resulting in less usage of scrolls for repairs of my weapon and armor."
PixelDungeon,3bgps1,Master_Yu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"That's impressive!  Is that your first try with 1.75 or you mean on iOS? I got to know PD just recently, with around 80 games with 1.72 and 20 games with 1.75. The durability system made it a lot harder, on the last run I had to burn serveral upgrades on ring of haste because I really don't want it to degrade. That game ends up winning with a +7 ring (originally +1), but only +3 for my armor and weapon since I use mostly enchanment scrolls on them to reset the durability, it was fun. From last game experience, I'd say +3 glaive might be a little bit ineffective if you were to destroy the fists first. The rotten fist is way too tough for low level weapon, and the burning fist seems to ignore your armor, so even a plate armor +9 I suppose wouldn't help a lot. Do you mind sharing how you do it? Did you saved up a lot of potions or the ring really helped like my last game?"
PixelDungeon,3bgps1,AverageMormonGamer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:03:53 2015 UTC,"This is my first iOS win. I've won 1.7.5 a few times.  I wasted 2 scrolls on a sword and 1 scroll on my lightning wand for the early game. In the late game I could have done armor +6 and weapon +4 but the armor had a displacement enchantment which is horrible against Yog, so I had to remove it via upgrading.  I think I used less than 10 health pots in my whole run. The ring was a bonus from the imp. The main lucky thing is a scale armor+1 before tengu I think.  Oh and I didn't kill the fists. I did the earthroot + surround yourself with larvae method.  My tactic is to save earthroot for Goo, DM-300 and Yog. And at least 4 mindvision, 2 invisibility, 3 map scrolls for the last 5 levels.  To counter degradation, save on scrolls of enchantment and upgrade and weighstones for repairs. Always upgrade end game equipment if they are degrading. For early game equipment, be very thrifty."

PixelDungeon,3bcz46,obeythenips,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:05:12 2015 UTC,I think the game would be designed around the assumption that you and the other player are communicating.
PixelDungeon,3bcz46,obeythenips,0,Sun Jun 28 15:13:02 2015 UTC,Maybe by previous record of multiplayer
PixelDungeon,3bcz46,roastedlasagna,2,Sun Jun 28 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking along the lines of up to 5 moves/actions per player at a time, with a button to skip your remaining turns. Players would need to stick together, but monsters would target the player who's currently taking their turn-block over the stasis player (if the two players are close to each other). (This means that as long as you stick together, monsters won't just smash you apart whilst your friend's 5 turns go by.  It would require good teamwork and communication, but isn't that the whole point? We wouldn't want to have 1 player item farming on level 11, while another player is fighting Yog-Dzewa!"
PixelDungeon,3bcz46,Wadege,10,Sun Jun 28 10:51:45 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer is a very common idea, and it always raises the same questions. If done right, I think people would love a multiplayer mod of Pixel Dungeon, but it would be very tricky and time-consuming to do right.  Let me point you in the directions of a few threads in which multiplayer implementation is discussed. You might be able to get a few ideas from there, and possibly see some of the challenges you might deal with when implementing multiplayer into a game designed from the ground up to be single player.   Suggesting additions to PD (including multiplayer) Is a multiplayer mod possible? Is a PD MMO possible? Current mod devs, is multiplayer possible? More multiplayer discussion   I highly encourage you read through all of these threads before making any sort of decision about multiplayer. Just because multiplayer sounds like a great idea on paper doesn't mean that it will be a good finished product.  (Note: I'm somewhat biased against multiplayer, if you can't tell, but don't let that discourage you from making a multiplayer mod. If done right, it would be well received for sure.

What we think would work great would be that if the two players were in the same room then they would have their individual qued up moves going turn based. When the players are in  separate areas of the dungeon the player would have his own turns to move freely. This would also include that turn based buffs would individually apply to them. For example I would only be hurt by lasting poison, burn, hunger and caustic damage when I move rather than my ally's turns."
PixelDungeon,3bcz46,forever_clever,2,Sun Jun 28 12:05:31 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, but it would mean a full reworking of the turn system (which would probably be really time consuming) and it would discourage close cooperation. I feel like people would be disposed to staying away from each other, which would make the game a lot less multiplayer-ish."
PixelDungeon,3bcz46,terrrrrible,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:33:30 2015 UTC,"While that is true there could be a ""team player"" or ""confidence"" buff where the closer you are to an ally the higher your metabolism and crit chance is. Another idea is each player would still have their ability to move freely until an enemy walks into the room"
PixelDungeon,3bcz46,castironpuppet,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:52:09 2015 UTC,"This sounds cool, but would be a huge pain in the ass to work out all the kinks before it's playable. Good luck if you pursue this."

PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,flappity,3,Sat Jun 27 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I already have a major complaint (but overall still really like the idea). As it currently stands there's no strategy whatsoever involved. Its just get to the next tier monster to get stronger with no penalties other than your own time.. Every run is a win if you want it to be.  I'd suggest limited revivals to add strategy, depth and more importantly challenge. 3 strikes and you're out; This way your deaths matter... Your first will be something you can make it to the lower levels with while your second will be what you want to win with, after that you're dead dead.   At which point you don't get to simply respawn as a tier 4 monster but actually have to start over."
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,Bleon582,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:00:50 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. I actually haven't thought of this aspect. I definitely want to make it as challenging as Pixel Dungeon, perhaps with difficulty levels like Skillful. Will spend sometime thinking about it.  Thanks for your feedback!"
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,Tehtacticalpanda,2,Sat Jun 27 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"No problem! It's fun for sure and I can't wait to see you expand on it, just needs death to have impact. This will definitely be staying on my tablet."
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,eridal,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:19:35 2015 UTC,"I could see something like a recharge timer on using the ability. Maybe one every X floors or every so many turns. So if you get yourself mobbed you'd still be in trouble. Maybe that rat last-hits you instead of a stronger mob, and two turns later you're still dead again, and your body can't deal with two rebirths in such a short time. Or limit it to once per stage (once in sewers, once in prison, etc etc). I'd see this leading to people just rushing to the boss to turn into it(if/when possible), so you might have to balance the next levels around that possibiity."
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,MrLolEthan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"Currently you restart from level 1 when you die. Are you suggesting resurrect on the same level like the ankh instead?   Currently bosses can't be played. If I make the playable boss classes equal in abilities to its minions, would that help?  I actually envision players dying at low levels with the higher tier mobs and thus restarting their progress. Also, with a death limit, there would be more skill and strategy involved. And in the far future, I might consider allowing some abilities from your previous lives to pass on."
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,MrLolEthan,2,Wed Jul 1 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't realize you actually restarted each time, as I haven't played it and was just going by what I was reading. I was imagining just dying and turning into the monster and was wondering how that was even challenging.  I think playing as bosses could be a cool flavor thing.. Maybe tone down what needs to be toned down but keep the general feel of it.  And yeah of course. If you've got a decent mob but die to something shitty you've basically restarted your progress, like you said.  It might even be worth toughening up the later levels anyways in some way, as players can already make it through the game well enough.  The other idea I was thinking would be toughen up bosses in such a way that the boss would be significantly harder  (but not impossible) if you weren't playing as a particular monster when you fought it. Sort of its weakness. And once you beat it, it stays dead through restarts of that character. And you could implement the limit there, I suppose. Maybe only X attempts at a boss before your body can't take another rebirth (with maybe the boss dropping an item that revitalizes you). Of course I'd be tempted to randomize the weakness for each actual playthrough (not death). So something in the first few levels would try to clue you in to the boss's weakness, and the challenge would be to find that hint and become that particular monster. And the randomization for that being so that a player who's gone through one doesn't automatically know who to turn into, there's still the element of figuring that out."
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,MrLolEthan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:23:12 2015 UTC,"Ahh hmmm. Nice suggestions.   I would definitely rework the bosses. And I have plans to make them tougher for certain classes, but this is solely for balancing.  The weakness element tho cool may not be the most rogue-like addition to the mod. I prefer to stick to the roots.  Thanks for the suggestions :)"

PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,aerolith,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"Only a view suggestions so far:   After the second sentence of the rat claws description, the full stop is at the beginning of the third sentence after the line break (put it in front of the line break). Window with the current changes shows every time starting the app. Maybe it would help balancing the game if the stats you are starting with don't differ such a lot from the stats of the normal mob version (e.g. the rat character has more than twice the lifepoints of the mob version). swarm of flies and evil eye should fly by default (maybe a potion which prevents you from flying). Also scorpio should not be able to attack enemies on nearby tiles (maybe give him a little speed buff). I think, it may help balancing the game if the playable classes are more like the mob versions, because e.g. the scorpio is a little bit overpowered in my opinion as he can use his attack on nearby enemies and can also deal melee damage. Items which can't be unequipped should not be able to be disarmed by monks   [edit: only changed formatting]"
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,HOLD-SHIFT,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"I like your balancing ideas. It was my initial intent but because I wanted each tier slightly more powerful than the previous, it kinda got scaled out of proportion.  Did you get disarmed by a monk while holding an unequipped item? I will look into the rest. Thanks for your feedback! :)"
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,Natinals,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"I got disarmed while I played a Scorpio and I had a Scorpio Stinger equipped. I think one should not be able to equip another weapon or to unequip a weapon which represents a part of your characters body. But even if one has equipped such a weapon, the monks are able to disarm you. [EDIT] according to my recent games, the sewer crab class seems weaker then the sewer crab mob, because the playable version is slower then the mob version and the mob version seems to have a much higher defense skill."
PixelDungeon,3b9c5z,Natinals,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:03:44 2015 UTC,"Oops, the disarming issue is a bug. Thanks for the find.   Yes. The class starts out weaker than the mob most of the time. Programming wise, the player has more hp but tends to be weaker than most of the mobs. But the items and equipment even outs this disadvantage, especially through improvements.  When I do the rebalancing of the entire system I will consider weakening the weapon and armor damage, but improving the base stats."

PixelDungeon,3b851d,insanechipmunk,4,Fri Jun 26 19:08:14 2015 UTC,I consider myself an absolute failure if I don't reach the Goo. I'd say I lose maybe 1/20 games before then.
PixelDungeon,3b851d,Lolleroo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:29:32 2015 UTC,Basically this. If I don't make it past Goo I usually just sit the game down for awhile because I'm clearly playing awfully. :P  It isn't until the prison I consider death a real threat (even though Tengu is pretty much a joke IMO).
PixelDungeon,3b851d,mrfluffleupagus,2,Sat Jun 27 03:24:29 2015 UTC,Have you unlocked the classes on level 10? Once you do that it gets easier.

PixelDungeon,3b851d,Pinetarball,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:34:05 2015 UTC,That sounds about right.  Getting lucky with an animated statue or the ghost drop really helps. Make sure you use the question mark on the statues to see what they're holding. I just finished the game with over a dozen pots of health left and 4 food and I had a glave +3 that I never really used because I got a vampiric long sword +2. Used one upgrade on that and just cruised through. Even made it back out of the dungeon.
PixelDungeon,3b851d,Scharnvirk,2,Sun Jun 28 03:40:31 2015 UTC,I didnt even think to examine the statues.  Holy shit.  That is great attention to detail.  This game is suprisingly well designed.  Well worth the 0 dollars I paid.  Gonna have to donate when I get some spare cash.
PixelDungeon,3b851d,notapencil,2,Sun Jun 28 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"Usually one in three succeeds. Some get abandoned later on because they are REALLY medicore, some lose momentum on skeletons and then the rest are wins.   But two out of three characters end up as crab crap eventually."
PixelDungeon,3b851d,Nawel_Do,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's not that hard to get past Goo unless the RNG screws you up really bad (throwing 4 crabs at you the moment you turn a corner, for example), or you limit yourself (like saving upgrade scrolls for later, which I usually always do). The chance that I die in stage 1 is about 1 in 4, and that would be even lower if I used my scrolls more liberally."

PixelDungeon,3b4r0o,dachhack,2,Fri Jun 26 12:29:49 2015 UTC,What were the shadow yog bugs if you don't mind me asking?
PixelDungeon,3b4r0o,dachhack,2,Fri Jun 26 00:29:15 2015 UTC,Just on the floor itself. Would constantly just crash saying it has stopped working. My only guess would be that there were way too many units in play.

So if you are all out of tombstones to smash open, just keep running from one end of the level to the other, and they will spawn.  EDIT: There are three enemies that spawn: Liches, Blue Wraiths, and Wraiths. Endless supply of health potions from Liches, Blue Wraiths drop dew, and Wraiths drop Upgrade and Enchantment scrolls."

PixelDungeon,3b4t39,portezbie,3,Fri Jun 26 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"it's tricky to accomplish on phones though, due to the limited screen space. Simply clumping all of the UI in one corner would look awful and create issues with the tag system (e.g. the red attack tag that pops up when you're near an enemy). This could be solved by moving quickslots to a popup but last time I considered that the community was pretty vocally against it."

PixelDungeon,3b1btu,sheix,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:14:56 2015 UTC,"I like the new layout even if it's fairly minor changes. Immediate reaction to the merged examine/search was ""ew, pls no."" But I adjusted in a matter of seconds. :P  4 quickslots will definitely make certain things less tedious."
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,mrfluffleupagus,2,Thu Jun 25 05:41:29 2015 UTC,"I think I am still at ""ew, pls no"" when it comes to the search button. I like to use it as a turbo-wait-when-starved button and now that's not really possible ;p  What about one little upgrade? As long as the player holds the wait button, the character waits like he was sleeping - even if starving. This way, the search-""ask"" button stays as it was, and it is possible to wait while starving."
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,Scharnvirk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:41:30 2015 UTC,I'm probably just going to make the existing wait functionality work in more cases. e.g. if you are starving and hit wait anyway it'll wait through the starving.
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,Scharnvirk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"I've just made few (badly unlucky ;p) runs.  Search as it is now gets annoying really fast. I've just had three chances to knock all the walls on the Goo level looking for the not-that-secret room. It took ""a while"".  Also gone is safety-checking floor for traps as it takes so long now.  Extra slots are nice, but I think having search available on a separate button is more important. Or maybe swap their functions? Search as primary, ask as secondary?"
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,Scharnvirk,2,Thu Jun 25 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're long-pressing to search, you can also double tap to search which is much faster.  I initially implemented it as a long-press and changed it to a double tap for this exact reason, will probably remove the long-press functionality in the next beta release to prevent confusion."
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,aaronchi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:30:47 2015 UTC,Ahhhhh... thanks :D  I didn't realize you can double tap to search. Thanks!
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,PyrodudeIN,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:43:27 2015 UTC,I think double tap for search is a difficult change because it is not obvious at all. How are new users going to know about it?
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,Scharnvirk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:23:47 2015 UTC,That will be addressed in future beta iterations before release.

I think the wait button needs a little modification (more on that in other comment), and I'd like to request a little quality-of-life fix:  If you pick up a weapon which is identified and not cursed and you don't have anything in your hands, it goes straight to your hands.

PixelDungeon,3b1btu,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:39:07 2015 UTC,"Uhm, a small Suggestion Maybe you could make the area around the quickslot bottons etc un""click""able so if for example you go to use your wand of venom, that you don't end up running to the other side of the map..."
PixelDungeon,3b1btu,mrfluffleupagus,2,Fri Jun 26 06:53:22 2015 UTC,"there's only really so much I can do for this sort of thing before I make areas that players might legitimately press to move not pressable.

PixelDungeon,3aza95,aguacateojos,3,Wed Jun 24 18:23:49 2015 UTC,Now just what the hell does it do?
PixelDungeon,3aza95,fistsforall,5,Wed Jun 24 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"Gives you a blessing, raising accuracy and dodging(?). If you cook it with a bland fruit, it acts as a potion of experience"
PixelDungeon,3aza95,Nawel_Do,2,Wed Jun 24 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"I gives you an accuracy and dodge buff for 30 turns when you step on it ( ""Blessed"" buff). You can also cook it with a blandfuit, it will have the same effect as a potion of exp.   You can find these seeds fairly often using a good wand of regrowth. Farming it is the best way to reach lvl 30 which is the maximum lvl in Shattered."
PixelDungeon,3aza95,Clyybber,0,Wed Jun 24 18:42:27 2015 UTC,Nope its not the maximum lvl
PixelDungeon,3aza95,00-Evan,3,Wed Jun 24 19:51:03 2015 UTC,pretty sure I set a level cap at 30. Were you able to go above that?
PixelDungeon,3aza95,Nawel_Do,2,Wed Jun 24 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"I tried to eat a blandfruit cooked with a starflower seed at lvl 30. It does not give one more lvl but the blessed buff instead.  I did not try with a potion.   By the way there is also a max HP cap at 175hp. It is the max HP you use to have at lvl 30 but that mean you lose the extra HP from a ring of might,  and that's sad. The cap is the same for the hunteress even if she is supposed to have only 170 HP at lv30."
PixelDungeon,3aza95,Nawel_Do,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"Oops there is something wrong with what i said, but still i had 175hp with a lv30 warden and a +3 ring of might and it should be 185. Maybe it's just late and i didn't understand something :/"
PixelDungeon,3aza95,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Your math is a bit off there. Huntress starts at 15 HP, with 29 levels (remember you start at 1, not 0) you'll get 145 more HP for a total of 160. At +3 that ring will give you 15 more health for 175 total.  There is no health cap."
PixelDungeon,3aza95,redsky1397,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:36:27 2015 UTC,well what is the highest you can get with potions of might and all.
PixelDungeon,3aza95,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:23:02 2015 UTC,"hmm.. answer is 'it depends'.  For fun, if we assume you somehow turn every potion of strength into a potion of might, including the rotberry potion, that's 9+1=10 might potions. for +10 strength and +50 HP.  Then if you find 3 rings of might, two of which are +3 and the 3rd is to be used with the blacksmith, plus all 13 possible upgrade scrolls for 3+3+1+13=20 levels total. That makes +20 strength and +100 HP.  plus level 30 on the warrior which is 11 strength and 165 HP  You would have a total of 41 strength and 315 HP  Finding that many wells of transformation and three rings is basically impossible though.  You could also feasibly get several more ring levels using heroes remains in the demon halls, but that would also be extremely rare. If we sack our +3 ring for a remains ring, that could cap out at +8 on floor 25, we would get +5 more ring levels total for a maximum theoretical cap at:  46 strength and 340 HP  EDIT: oh! but we could also get a ring of might from the imp which caps out at +5!  that gives us 2 more ring levels, for a max of:  48 strength and 350HP with odds that are probably less than one in a googolplex."

PixelDungeon,3axo8t,gillecave500,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"This works well with an upgraded firebolt or lightning wand or an amok wand, too. Boomerang has the advantage of unlimited uses, but it can miss, and those fish can dodge like crazy.  And definitely take care not to lose your boomerang in there. Learn the sniper tricks - what squares to target to hit enemies one column aside from the doorway.  Teleport wand also kills piranhas (usually). If they appear on land, they die immediately. But if the random teleport puts them in water, then they'll be somewhere else in the level to aggravate you. But you can just teleport them again."
PixelDungeon,3azy6n,Ragezors,3,Wed Jun 24 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"Really, just make sure you explore every room. Identify potions and scrolls somewhere safe (usually before you're about to descend). I identify scrolls first if the potion of liquid flame hasn't been identified.  Also, read this. Those rooms usually have great stuff, and the locked door means you have time to recover hp before exploring the new level.  A bit of it is luck, as always, since you'll have an easier time if you can afford to use all your scrolls on stuff that'll take you to the last boss instead of using them on items you'll discard later."

PixelDungeon,3ax23o,crybllrd,4,Wed Jun 24 04:50:16 2015 UTC,The damage dealt/absorbed for tier X weapons/armor goes up by X for every upgrade.  It is usually worth it to save your upgrade scrolls for the later tier equipment.

Hoard the scrolls and use them to properly equip better things and then improve those. A lot of times it makes sense to upgrade a ring or uncurse a wand around that same time too, your call."
PixelDungeon,3ax23o,fistsforall,2,Wed Jun 24 05:17:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on the class you play for weapons.  For armor, I really suggest getting higher tier stuff asap because damage goes up pretty quickly, unless you're a rogue. They can dodge a lot more when they have more strength than the armor needs."

PixelDungeon,3at9kd,dachhack,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:56:30 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's a whole new ballgame with knuckleduster. You need to know how to wring every last upgrade scroll out of the game and put them into the weapon. Then avoid damage throughout since your armor won't be strong. Bottom line is that the gameplay/challenges change in Sprouted.

PixelDungeon,3asx4c,TestTheTester,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:34:09 2015 UTC,"I've also been noticing that sometimes when zapping a 10/10 imbued staff, the charge does not decrease (imbued with wands other than transfusion), which leads me to believe its real max is higher."
PixelDungeon,3asx4c,00-Evan,3,Tue Jun 23 06:47:08 2015 UTC,Are you running the latest patch(0.3.0e)? There were a couple uncommon issues with how the battlemage's melee hits charged his staff which I fixed in that patch.
PixelDungeon,3asx4c,DerTanni,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:07:20 2015 UTC,just asking here as it maybe fits. Did you change it so that you need 2-3 hits for one staff recharge on purpose? I did not play vanilla in a long time but I remember it to be different.
PixelDungeon,3asx4c,00-Evan,2,Tue Jun 23 14:34:06 2015 UTC,"The battlemage got his power generally shifted around a bunch, which includes less charge on-hit. One of the big reasons for this is there are now more powerful wands that rely on expending multiple charges (most direct example is fireblast), and in order to balance them properly I didn't want the player to get easy access to immediate charge increases. This is the same reason the scroll of recharging now grants charge over time instead of instantly.  For the battlemage, he loses some melee damage (staff does less than a wand would, but not hugely less), loses some charge on hit, but gains unique enchantment-like effects, and benefits from wands generally being stronger.  Edit: also, if you want to get tonnes of charge from being a battlemage, try sticking with a staff of magic missile."

All of your wands have potential of damaging you, but you can use the higher charge and recharge that comes with imbuing to keep your enemies at a distance where those offensive wands will only harm them and not you."
PixelDungeon,3amfm6,PyrodudeIN,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"I am doing a Blast Wave Wand run right now. The staff is at +8. Average damage is around 10 and you get another roll if the enemy hits the wall behind him. The damage is also very uneven, frequently going as low as 2, and sometimes dealing 21.   Generally speaking, this is not a wand which will make you see big numbers. Its effectiveness is medicore and its special (throwing mobs around the map), altough fun, doesn't really do much.  Yet the run progresses well. I've for example have just beaten DM-300 without using any potion (though buffed myself with seeds of earthroot and liferoot), and altough this was a long fight, I didn't have any serious trouble.  I predict very serious problem in lower levels, though. I have no idea how will I deal with Dwarven Warlocks (putting distance between them and me is the last thing I want), and overall low wand's damage will probably be not enough against golems and monks. I have a wand of Disintegration waiting in case the BlastWave gets totally unusable. So far the choice is very clear: Venom > Disintegration > Fireblast > Regrowth > Blastwave > others I didn't try yet >>>>>>>> nothing....>>>> Transfusion. Seriously, wtf with that one, less corruptey than Corruption, less damage than Prismatic and all that at the cost of charges AND life? This one is the new Wand of Flock when it comes to usefullness ;p"
PixelDungeon,3amfm6,Scharnvirk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"Bleh.  That run ended up being forced to the Disintegration Wand very quickly. To say that Blastwave is useless against Dwarven Sorcerers... well, let's just say it is better to use Fireblast on Fire elementals than Blastwave on the Sorcerers :D  It pushes them back, they immediately retaliate (possibly many times because they are now FAR AWAY but still in line to fire) and deals completely neglible damage. It will be even worse with the Scorpios so... ultimately, this wand is definitely not an end-game item. Fun up to caves and that's pretty much it."

Use the ""Water"" option and keep farming dew until the vial is full and you get the ""Bless"" option. Bless has a 1/3 chance of upgrading your equipment. The maximum level with dew vial upgrades is ""5+FurthestFloor/3"". By floor 15 you should have all your gear to +10. Use all of the upgrade scrolls on your weapon after it has reached +10. An easy way to beat DM is to drink a mind vision and use haste to get to the machines. Kill the machines while dodging the robots with haste. After you've destroyed both machines, slowly kill all of the robots around DM or if DM is alone kill it quickly and leave."

Then apply the above strategy to killing off the robots left over as 8 robots can definitely kill you if they all hit. oh and don't use upgrade scrolls until you are atleast to depth 19, its just a waste otherwise.

Then mine 100+ gold in the caves levels and have the blacksmith turn your best +10 item (e.g., your weapon) into a +20 item using that spare +10 piece of equipment you've been lugging around.  Then use all of your upgrade scrolls you've been saving on that +20 item. (Including the ones you got by deliberately spawning 4 wraiths from every gravestone and killing all of them.)  Now start out that fight by eating a dungeon berry. Use the ""splash"" function of your dew vial (invis+haste). Run around until you find the printers (reapplying splash once both buffs wear off). Kick their butts quickly. Now run around using your invis cloak as needed to pick off the robots one by one. If things get tough, just go invis and get away, let that berry heal you (you should have like 100 of them from all the dew farming you did to dew-bless your gear, so just eat more when the regeneration buff wears off).

Despite the screenshots (which are from v1.7.2), the game is actually v1.7.5, which includes item degradation. Also no option for a legacy mode, so you're stuck with degradation. Sorry folks :(  There are no major differences that I can tell between the iOS version and Android version. The only problem is that the lack of a back button on iOS devices sometimes makes it difficult to exit out of the inventory. Also there is no landscape mode on iPhone.

As for mods, ultimately it all comes down to Watabou, but i'd imagine it will at least be much more restrictive to get derivative works out on iOS/Steam.

The classical rogue likes on this platform are mostly old, not optimized, not updated since 3 or 4 years. There is a place of kings to take, and I think both PD and Shattered PD can rules on iOS. So please, do not forgot us, poor iPhones users we are. Personally I NEED Shattered PD on my iPhone, this game is becoming in my eyes, update after update, one of the best game ever made.

I just feel that the price point is slightly too high given than on android its free.  Also, even tho I paid for it on iPad (as mentioned in another comment), the value of the game for those who already have the app is alot lower.  I just feel like there is a better way of doing this?

PixelDungeon,3aemkx,jengelke,7,Fri Jun 19 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"this is a level feel exclusive to shattered that replicates the old night mode, plus some added darkness. I disabled the normal night mode functionality as some players were unhappy with having to play at certain times to avoid it. Enemy spawns are roughly twice as frequent, so you will run into a lot of baddies. Depending on how your run is going these floors can either be a real challenge, or an excellent opportunity to farm some exp."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,jengelke,5,Fri Jun 19 14:06:42 2015 UTC,"The whole point of the battlemage is that he gets to supplement his weak direct melee damage with enchant effects and wand use. You're essentially trading a big portion of melee damage for a second enchant and wand recharge on-hit. While I could easily increase the damage, it's not really in line with how the battlemage should work, I would rather make the wand effects stronger if he needs buffing.  Regarding the prismatic light change, the stunning enchant was a bit too strong. Prismatic light already does a great job of keeping enemies at bay, so my thought with changing the effect to cripple was to help players get distance with enemies that do get close, to synergize with the wand working better at a distance."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,00-Evan,-2,Fri Jun 19 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"I can't say, in experience at least, that the wand use is a great replacement. Several runs since the update and many times I will just hit a wall when I get so far that I couldn't possibly have overcome because I either don't have the right wand (still haven't found the best for damage"" or I didn't have enough wands. When there are a great number of enemies, I can't possibly keep up with wand charges and end up attempting to hit with the stave. Of course, this is bad since many times, you can't actually hit the monster to start a recharge buff. In this particular game, I have gained only 6 Scrolls of Upgrade in 12 floors and +3 Plate and a +3 Wand of Prismatic Light are very mediocre. It feels like I'm a Huntress still using the dagger and a +2 or 3 boomerang and crappy chainmail. :/  The Wand on the other hand works ok, but most of the time, even if blinded, the enemy comes straight at me."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,00-Evan,3,Fri Jun 19 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"Prismatic light is not as much of a direct damage wand, and more often benefits playstyles that involve other items which capitalize on range, for example, the huntress loves it. By being a prismatic light battlemage, you have a lot of tools to keep enemies at a distance and nullify the attacks of ranged enemies, but that works best with other items that can also capitalize on that.   It may have been a better idea to keep your prismatic light want as a side-arm and stick with magic missile for the time being on your staff.   I do admit that it sucks to expect the staff effect to do one thing and it ends up doing another though, sorry about that."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,Leuten,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said before, I didn't know the direct damage attack had been nerfed to pure utility."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:20:15 2015 UTC,I don't exactly have any suggestions for this idea but I'm thinking maybe you could try to do something for the battle mage that lets it be a little more powerful against ranged enemies? if you run out of charges you're kind in some trouble..
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,00-Evan,2,Fri Jun 19 21:11:37 2015 UTC,"The overall gist of the mage change seems to be that the new wands are great (some were even too great and had to be nerfed). But battlemages now kind of suck. Put those wands in the hand of a sniper, freerunner, etc., and life is grand.  With a battlemage, just wield a normal weapon until you find the right wand and get your staff highly upgraded."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,NCOSRane,2,Fri Jun 19 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"That's interesting to hear, given that pretty recently people were complaining that the battlemage was too powerful. Certainly not all wands will work as a main weapon in all cases, and not all wands are custom tailored to the mage, but the intention is very much that the battlemage should be able to stick with his staff and have a reasonable chance of finding a wand that works for him."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,00-Evan,2,Fri Jun 19 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"I guess the more accurate, whole story, is that if you get over the initial hump, a battlemage does okay. But man, oh man, is that initial hump rough. And while an old-school battlemage could do okay if the random generation gods screwed him, the new version really needs to find a decent wand or two early. Or just bash things with a sword until he does.  I think the saving grace, though, is that magic missile is actually a little viable early on (especially with an upgrade or two). I haven't tried keeping it and upgrading it heavily, though. Does it stay competitive with a real wand the whole way up, or is it still more of a starter-weapon that you're supposed to replace?"
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,Scharnvirk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"The whole point of magic missile for the battlemage is that its damage falls of HARD around the mid-lategame, but the battlemage can coast on it for a little while given that it gives him lots of free charges with its effect. Other mage subclasses can't stick with it as long, but they also aren't as dependant on the staff.  Consider that giving up that effect is junking a wand basically, the time eventually comes that magic missile is too weak (unless you found many wands for it to charge), but you shouldn't feel compelled to junk it early without reason to."
PixelDungeon,3aek0z,MoronLessOff,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"My best ever run was with a battlemage with wand of venom. I didn't even have to use armor and ended up having 20+ healing potions, would be even more if I didn't do so many stupid mistakes.  My second best run was with... battlemage, this time wand of disintegration.  My third best run was with, surprisingly, battlemage. With wand of fire.  He isn't overpowered, but certainly he is VERY, VERY powerful. And has many more options than all other classes... combined."

PixelDungeon,3adro2,gohjohn,0,Fri Jun 19 08:10:50 2015 UTC,"These seem to rely on some pretty specific items (last one especially) that you may or may not have.

PixelDungeon,3adro2,jengelke,2,Fri Jun 19 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"That's kind of just part of the game isn't it. Potions of levitation and icecap seeds aren't all that uncommon, also remember you can just leave it there till you have the right items to get it...

PixelDungeon,3adro2,MordecaiWalfish,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:20:01 2015 UTC,If you're in such dire straights that you're relying on food to give you health then that one upgrade scroll isn't going to do much for you I'm afraid.
PixelDungeon,3adro2,SGAdventures,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:32:05 2015 UTC,"as said by gohjohn icecap is my preferred one, this also works for the shamen' if you are using a fire debuff on them, throw the icecap under them and the scroll dropping when they die triggers the ice cap putting out the fire :) Lloyd's Beacon is completely different to a wand of teleportation, and you may be thinking of a wand of telekinesis? Teleportation in the original doesn't work on items :)"
PixelDungeon,3aeiqw,jengelke,4,Fri Jun 19 13:55:49 2015 UTC,"probably just bad variance, though you may also be noticing it more as the battlemage isn't doing as much damage with the staff as you are used to from a regular weapon, meaning the enemies are getting in more hits."
PixelDungeon,3ab4zn,Maddog2212,13,Thu Jun 18 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"Sure!  One of the most helpful things to do to get past Goo is to find yourself a seed of earthroot.  Inform her that standing on top of the seed gives you awesome armor as long as you do not move.  Also tell her that Goo's caustic ooze can be washed off by walking in water, therefore the most strategic approach to defeating Goo is to plant a seed of earthroot on a wet tile while goo stands on a dry tile due to the fact that he regenerates health while on wet tiles.  If she cannot get one of these seeds then the next best option is to keep Goo on dry tiles to keep it from healing as well as moving out of the way of Goo's killer attacks over widespread area.  This is mostly how I approach Goo.  Getting a honeypot is also awesome for fighting Goo because Goo will focus its attacks on the bee if the bee is attacking Goo so you are free to do massive damage while the bee is alive."

PixelDungeon,3a5kp0,ItsSomethingLikeThat,2,Wed Jun 17 12:39:20 2015 UTC,I think it was a +8 Wand of Firebolt with Two +3 Rings of Magic. Very few things lasted more than one shot.
PixelDungeon,3a5kp0,thinbuddha,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:42:53 2015 UTC,So let's say that you have 5 upgrade scrolls that you would like to put into the rings. What is the most powerful way to use the scrolls? Is putting 3 on one and 2 on the other the same as placing all 5 on one?
PixelDungeon,3a5kp0,00-Evan,3,Wed Jun 17 18:36:52 2015 UTC,"ring levels are always added together so it makes no difference, tough putting all of them into one ring is better due to degradation in vanilla and the possibility of switching out the 2nd ring at some point."
PixelDungeon,3a5kp0,ItsSomethingLikeThat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"Like Evan said, you're better off using them on the same ring in case you find a second ring or artifact you'd rather have instead."

PixelDungeon,3a683h,TheFrenchNinja,2,Wed Jun 17 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"Lightening doesn't reduce the chance of the enchantment firing off.  Lightening is generally better overall (the amount of damage reduced is more than offset by the increased speed, even without taking enchantments into consideration.)  But really, lighter vs. heavier depends on the weapon, the enchantment, and your class. Like a vampiric weapon. The amount of health you recover is based on the amount of damage you do, and some enemies are armored. So three hits for 10 won't heal you as much as one bigass hit for 30. Stunning is a neutral one. On one hand, you want a lot of attacks so you get that initial stun to happen. But on the other, you want that next hit when your target is stunned and can't dodge to be as big as possible because a bunch of small ones risk un-stunning the target.  Pretty much every other enchantment favors lightened weapons, but some enchantments (e.g., venomous/chilling, maybe even blazing or shocking) are too weak to matter. It's nice when they happen, but killing your enemy faster with more regular damage negates the benefit of those enchantments anyway. Lucky's kind of neutral in that regard, too. Do you end up doing more damage when lucky fires off more times, or just doing more regular damage with your weapon? Eldritch? Do you want to hit the enemy once or twice weakly and send him running away, or do you just want to kill him faster?  Grim's pretty obviously a fast weapon enchantment.  I think it fires off one time in ten on the average?  Put that baby on a lightened knuckleduster."
PixelDungeon,3a683h,NCOSRane,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"I pretty much never balance my weapons heavy. The extra damage is NOT worth the enemy getting extra hits on you if you don't kill them in one hit. Also, enchantments can proc EVERY time that weapon hits the enemy, so yes, balancing it lighter would give you more chances."
PixelDungeon,3a683h,Omen267901,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"There is a good reason for balancing for heavy hits: surprise attacks, especially for Assassin. If you are guaranteed to hit (and crit!) then having a BIG blade is a great thing to have, as it might one-shot the mob... even if it takes more than one round.   But other than that, lighter -> better."
PixelDungeon,3a683h,Scharnvirk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:54:32 2015 UTC,could you imagine imbuding wand of lightning with wizards staff and adding a vampiric enchant? most op thing
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,eridal,2,Tue Jun 16 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"Imbuing your wands with your staff changes the power that the staff has to the power of the newly imbued wand. I believe it also gives the staff the highest upgrade level of the two. If you're a battlemage, your staff also gains a new ability in melee depending on the wand."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,TheCanadianAlligator,2,Tue Jun 16 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"Generally you will only want to imbue your staff with a wand if you want your main wand to have that power and you will only want to do it once per wand type.  For example, you might find a wand of lightning and feel that that is preferable to magic missile, so go ahead and imbue it. If you find another lightning wand, leave it alone because it won't change anything. If you find a wand of transfusion you might want to leave that as is too unless you really like transfusion. If you find say a wand of frost and like that even more than lightning than by all means imbue that and it will replace the lightning."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,portezbie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"It's also worth mentioning that certain wands are not worth imbuing to be used as your main. Utility wands or ""speciality"" wands like frost (wands better used along side another wand) probably aren't a great choice for maining.   You can of course, you probably have a harder time for doing so though. The staff is best imbued with something offensive."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"That's funny I love using frost as my main wand. Does a good amount of damage without excessive fallout like the fireblast wand. The prismatic wand and disintegration wand both seemed weaker to me but I didn't level them up much. The frost wand also does this awesome thing (arguably almost too good in my mind), where if it is high level enough it has an almost 100% chance of freezing enemies standing in water. You can freeze them, run to a safe distance, hit them with a different wand, and then again with the frost wand, repeat.  What are your favorite offensive wands?"
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,portezbie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:30:14 2015 UTC,"The freezing is why I wouldn't recommend it as a main wand, actually. When frozen the damage loss isn't worth the turns of being frozen playing a mage in my opinion and as a Battle mage is a detriment.  The fallout of the fireblast can (mostly) be avoided so it's usually my first pick, blast wave or lightning would be more or less tied for second.. Their damage might not be quite the same but the added utility has saved my life more than once.  The venom wand can actually be pretty deadly on an OP level as well.. 1v1 not so much but large rooms of enemies can become jokes with a good enough one, funnel them into the door way and watch them die without laying a hand on most of them. :P"
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like the venom wand, but I don't see it as a main weapon. The thing that kills me with fireblast is that it sets you on fire if you use it in a door so you have to either enter or exit the room and if you exit the room the door closes. I haven't really used the blast wave wand so I need to experiment with that one more. Lightning I'm not crazy about because you can't use it against enemies next to you."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,portezbie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"Venom is actually my currently only post-wand change win, I wasn't expecting it to be a good main but it shocked me. Lightning self damage isn't a concern to me personally :P Mostly because with it upgraded enough very few things actually reach me anyway but the damage is fairly negligible when it does happen (and I'm kind of reckless lol)."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:44:10 2015 UTC,"Prismatic staff is great - 1v1 fights become trivial as a battlemage.  Disintegration staff was ok - it charges quickly in the staff, which is the main benefit."

PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,portezbie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:47:29 2015 UTC,"I had a +8 Staff of Regrowth.  The herbal healing was like a kiss on a boo boo, it barely heals...it did let me farm hella seeds and brew gallons of potion.  I digress.  Its damage was weak.  So, before I headed into the Demon Halls I imbued my staff to a +8 of Prismatic Light.  First off, the illumination helps spot those Evil Eyes and Scorpios in the dark.  Second, the blind from the blast lets you escape or approach them safely.  Third, Staff of Prismatic Light's melee attack can cripple enemies letting you escape Eyes and chase down Scorpios.  Finally, Prismatic Light does increased damage to Evil enemies.  It would take 4 or 5 shots to take down an Eye.  But when I recharge my staff as a Battle Mage and Eyes might be able to get 2 shots on me while they're crippled, the Halls were a breeze."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,MoronLessOff,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:53:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, that sounds fun. The new wand system is really interesting, because a lot of it is about properly combining the damage of the wands projectile and melee attack."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,portezbie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:13:29 2015 UTC,when you auto attack you get an extra effect from the staff being imbued so for example a staff of corruption has a chance to give your enemy the amok debuff.
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,jestertiko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:42:35 2015 UTC,I am trying to beat the game with a mage right now.  I got a wand of regrowth that I'm using to farm seeds and dew so I'm a ' scared to imbue it to my main staff.  Does anyone know what it'll do?
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,darkwing_duck_87,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"It gives you Herbal Healing that increases with the plus, but I suggest not imbuing it.   Melee damage with the mage staff is pretty bad, so you should only do it if you need the additional plus or if you have a separate melee weapon you can use."
PixelDungeon,3a2wdo,fistsforall,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"You'll be able to farm seeds all game long, but the herbal healing and damage are both very weak.  I had my Staff of Regrowth at +8, and I don't think each buff would heal me for more than 3 or 4 points.  The benefit was all the grass and plants.  It helped that I had found Sandals of Nature.  I was able to level them quickly and stomp the grass into seeds.  Potions and plants EVERYWHERE!  However, I wouldn't do it again.  If you find a Prismatic Light or other battle wand, go with that instead.  Keep Magic Missile until you do.  Unless I'm mistaken, Magic Missile's melee proc recharges wands in your inventory.  Any imbued staff only recharges the staff."

PixelDungeon,3a3smk,mdskrzypczyk,2,Wed Jun 17 11:32:28 2015 UTC,"When a honeypot is thrown it breaks upon contact with where it lands.  Therefore, to make best use of the honeypot you would throw it at a location such that the enemies you want the bee to attack are closer to the honeypot than you are.  The best thing about doing this for the Goo fight is that Goo will focus its individual attacks on the bee while it is alive rather than going after you!  Note that when Goo uses his widespread area attack it will damage anything that is within the damage area."

The comments are quite revealing as to the reasons for the kickstarter failure.  As mentioned in other threads in this subreddit... For PD to become an MMO or even a multiplayer game, the amount of dev time needed is probably more work that all PD mods combined. So much so that it would no longer be just a mod but a totally new game.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of developers who have spare time here. Those that have and are interested in PD, are probably making/have made their own mods.  Which is why I suggested modding PD yourself :)  Reskining PD would be quite easy to learn and you can probably do the same. I believe the dev has posted some stuff here too. But sadly, from the same thread, he said he is no longer gonna work on it.  Edit: Also, from the same thread, some wisdom about game dev  If you are thinking of using the code from leptoon's remake, then this is probably the wrong subreddit because it would no longer be a PD mod."

PixelDungeon,39t4vu,SariusDev,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe one can choose the way of the old Diablo II and add a multiplier to the enemies stats and maybe increase the dropchance of items (depending on number of players) and also their quantity (maybe something like a 30% chance to drop an item for each player) and give the experience from killing monsters to all players.  Because I really like the idea of a multiplayer version of pixel dungeon, am also willing to help at development of such a mod"
PixelDungeon,39svrl,OldManBilly,2,Sun Jun 14 13:10:13 2015 UTC,"Generally the tactic behind rogue is to hit and run. simply hide behind doors or use your cloak to move yourself to where you have the advantage. another thing i would say is to take your time, as the rogue does have that advantage of not needing to eat as often, meaning that you can take your time on most levels (or grind for xp/health pots). The rogue simply doesnt have that tank style of the warrior, nor the sniping ability of a mage/huntress. the rogue does have the ability to dodge much more easily than most classes with lighter armour, so dont be afraid to use some upgrade scrolls on that cloth armor. When you do get the upgrade tomb (im assuming you havent yet) i would suggest freerunner for a more hit and run play style, or assassin for 1v1 combat (its always nice to have a damage bonus)."
PixelDungeon,39svrl,redsky1397,2,Sun Jun 14 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"Generally If I don't have a +1 weapon and a full dew vial when I get to goo I just start over. When you fight the goo try to harass it with a ranged weapon and/or a potion of liquid flame before it gets to the door. At the door plant the seed that puts mobs to sleep. When the goo steps onto the seed, plant a seed of firebloom and a seed of sorrowmoss in its path. Get as much distance as you can from the goo and earthroot yourself. Wake the goo up with a ranged weapon and watch it get poison and burned by the time the goo reaches you it should be burning and poisoned. Whack away at the goo until it dies. If your health drops below 15 chug the dew vial. The earthroot buff should keep you pretty well defended the entire fight. Remember to place the earthroot seed in water as well.    EDIT: If you find a honey pot use it and chip away at the goo's health with ranged attacks until the bee dies, then proceed to follow the plan above. If you get a honey pot and bombs, toss it at the goo with the bombs and by the time the bee dies you might be able to just tank the goo's damage if it lost enough health."
PixelDungeon,39svrl,Tehtacticalpanda,2,Sun Jun 14 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with Rogue is that he starts with worst item (dagger which is by far weakest tier 1 weapon), which he cannot upgrade. So unlike other characters, you just HAVE to find something..."
PixelDungeon,39svrl,Scharnvirk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:52:36 2015 UTC,I don't think you can stack herbal armor and herbal healing.
PixelDungeon,39svrl,Magicokito,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"It is all about that cloak and attack from behind corners and doors. Also, are you using any ranged stuff to hurt the goo? I try and save any fire seeds and poison seeds I find and just line them up between the goo and myself. Throw a flame potion at him if I have it. Then use the earthroot or sungrass seed."
PixelDungeon,39svrl,portezbie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:21:57 2015 UTC,"i would like to tell you that you can't stack herbal healing and earthroot unless you have the shoes (forgot what they are called) and step on a sungrass. Most of the time if you dont have a good melee weapon, you use seeds to your advantage and fire bomb the hell out of him. with a +3 wand of disintegration you must have gotten good damage on him seeing how much time you had to set up but the scale armor must have been your downfall. im assuming this as if this was unidentified, it must be at the base amount. generally if you are playing rogue, you are better off upgrading the cloth armor for the sewer levels just for that dodge bonus. it should also allow you to bypass goos critical attack (the ""!!!"" stage)."
PixelDungeon,39svrl,redsky1397,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:28:38 2015 UTC,Find some good armor and focus on upgrading it. By lowering the str requirement you can add a good chunk of dodge making your rogue last a lot longer.

PixelDungeon,39pdpp,Magicokito,2,Sat Jun 13 13:28:09 2015 UTC,"Corruption was gamebreakingly overpowered mainly because it was far too effective with a moderate number of upgrades. The ideal way to use it was to invest a few upgrades and then use it to steamroll most monsters, while building up many resources for bosses.  Currently the two things I'm looking into are the failure condition being too harsh, and the RNG currently built into corrupting low hp enemies. I might give it the older amok effect if it fails as some compensation for the nerfs, but I do feel it's much closer to being balanced now than it was before.  Regarding your particular case, what monsters were you using that +2 wand on?"
PixelDungeon,39pdpp,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:36:50 2015 UTC,"It happened with both sewers and prison monsters, I can't exactly recall but  it happened once with a rat for sure, then with a skel or thief, I died before reaching the caves.  I know it should be harder to corrupt higher level enemies but that wasn't the case this time.  Also thanks for the response!"
PixelDungeon,39pdpp,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"hmm, that's odd. Even at 1 charge a +2 wand of corruption should be almost guaranteed to corrupt a rat after its health is below half. With 2 charges the rat would be fairly likely to succumb even at full HP."
PixelDungeon,39pdpp,PyrodudeIN,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"I have failed corrupting a rat at 2 health with all 3 charges left.  Edit: I mean the wand was at full with 3 charges before using not after, sorry for the wording."
PixelDungeon,39pdpp,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"Hrm, in that case there may be a bug. At 2hp with a +1 wand that rat should be almost guaranteed corrupted in 1 charge."

I tried a run with the corruption staff after the nerf and it was basically impossible since i had to increase the staff level so much, but was unable to use it in boss fights . I think i lost in that run, but can't recall played alot recently. btw i had a + 4 staff atleast."
PixelDungeon,39pdpp,jestertiko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"the difficulty of corruption will heavily depend on the mob, even with low health, and there is some RNG involved. Do you remember what enemy was sometime taking 6 and sometimes taking 2?"

PixelDungeon,39n30g,EstherDarkish,3,Fri Jun 12 22:30:45 2015 UTC,I see...  Will send out a pre-release playtest link tonight.
PixelDungeon,39n30g,dachhack,2,Fri Jun 12 22:55:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, I tested the update you sent me, thank you very much.  So far, I had the time to do the death book, and IMO it is a bit boring : there is nothing to do except rob graves, 50% I didn't even do because there obviously was nothing of interest in them.  I amassed enough gold for the troll level, I'll test it later.  I think a big issue with Sprouted is the obnoxious amount of dungeon berries you can get easily. It removes every need for planification : I can pop one of my 100 berry, heal continuously and hack away without thinking, never fearing death.  I think you should reconsider the proportion of seeds that spawn : more ""normal"" seeds, less ""sprouted"" seed. They should be precious.  But ultimately, this is an issue with the water function of the vial : it is too powerful and if you spend the time, every one of your gear can be +10 without working for it. This means every upgrade scroll you find is worthless. Moreover, every dew you find is worthless after a while, because who cares about a red dew when you can have 20 normal ones in thirty seconds of watering ?  Maybe this is too much of a change, but I think a good solution would be this one :   The vial do not have the water option The vial have the option to switch between ""normal dew mode"" and ""collect dew mode"" ""Collect dew mode"" means you will collect the dews into the vial instead of consuming them if you do not have full health.   This change will allow you to make the dews important again, but not too horrible to collect if you have a rought run. This way, you can choose to always put dews in your vial and the bless mechanism will work as intended.  PS : Sometimes, the game crashed when I tried to close the game, and in the main menu, the ""back"" android button did not close the app, contrary to other pixel dungeon mods. This was before the fix you deployed, which I did not downloaded yet."
PixelDungeon,39n30g,dachhack,2,Mon Jun 15 10:32:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Thanks for the feedback. This is what I'm thinking...  For a future update, I'm going to try to remove the 'water' feature from the vial and instead have mini-bosses you can defeat at each stage. The bosses will drop an item that allows you to access special levels with higher dew availability.   I'll replace the 'water' feature with a 'mend' interaction that sips 5 from the vial and only heals a bit. So you can still get tiny heals from dew if you want. Drops will automatically be collected regardless of health.   Bless might cost more dew to use though and only be available if you are at full health."
PixelDungeon,39n30g,dachhack,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:53:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, and someone said it was tedious to collect dews in those big levels, so maybe, if you allow the collection of dew regardless of health, a good idea would be to automatically collect the dew when you run on top of it, instead of having to click on it.  I mean : you run over some grass, behind you, two dews appear, you run back over the dews, you automatically collect them. No need to click on each one.  That would make dew collecting a lot less tedious."

PixelDungeon,39izyr,OldManBilly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:59:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry for getting back to you so late. To put it as simple as possible..  Imbued staves give a melee effect for the battle mage, most are pretty straight forward like a lighting wand giving the lighting effect.. this also stacks with regular enchants though, so on some (like lighting or fire) you can double the effect or get some cool mixes like a staff that both freezes and burns the enemy."
PixelDungeon,39izyr,OldManBilly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"Oh so rather than the effects overlapping one another they actually stack? Nice, I thought that imbuing wands would cancel out the original magic missile ability which would make me sad so I didn't dare to do it."

PixelDungeon,39evyl,Tom1206,6,Thu Jun 11 06:58:34 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly then the GPL assets would taint the project and you'd have to release the source code under GPL too. Can't find any other sources that state GPL apps are allowed on the iOS app store.  I'd personally just use some non-GPL assets such as:  http://kenney.nl/assets/roguelike-characters  http://kenney.nl/assets/roguelike-rpg-pack  They're under CC0 so you can do pretty much whatever you like with them.

PixelDungeon,39gbme,MoronLessOff,3,Thu Jun 11 15:10:06 2015 UTC,"The battlemage, being dependant on his staff, is going to have less direct melee damage. If you combo that with a wand that doesn't do damage then you're definitely going to have to think of alternative ways to deal with enemies. You can improve your damage situation through enchanting the staff with a scroll of magical infusion though.  Greaves give the exact same buff as earthroot, so no they don't stack with eachother in the way you're thinking of. If I assume you're level 15, which means you'd have 110 HP, you should be able to safely get that chalice to +8 while leaning on herbal armor buffs."

It was a favorite on college Unix systems in the early to mid-1980s,  in part due to the procedural generation of game content.  Rogue popularized dungeon crawling as a video game trope, leading others to develop a class of derivatives known collectively as ""roguelikes"".  For example, it directly inspired Hack,   which in turn led to NetHack.  Roguelikes have since influenced commercial games outside the genre, such as Diablo.

PixelDungeon,392ojo,00-Evan,2,Mon Jun 8 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"Well I don't really know what to say. It was diagonal movement if that helps. Also, I'm able to reproduce it with mobs, which I must say is quite fun ! http://imgur.com/Rivoe7r  Edit:I'm not touching the game for now. Is there a way I can copy my game state and send it to you ?"
PixelDungeon,392ojo,00-Evan,3,Mon Jun 8 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've taken a look at the code and can see why this is happening. A few issues have popped up with the changes in 0.3.0c, will likely do a final bugfix patch sometime in the next day or two."
PixelDungeon,392ojo,ThereYaGo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened to me today   Hit the gnoll brute with the blast wand to send him flying through the chasm, but he just hanged there. Finished him off with the boomerang.   Chasms seemed to be working erratic on this run. I managed to send a few of the poisonous crabs flying through the chasm with the wand, but one or two brutes ""landed"" on a chasm tile just next to a platform tile and they managed to walk/hop to it on their turn to play. the screenshot was the last bug that I got, went to the next level not long after this."
PixelDungeon,392ojo,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:23:45 2015 UTC,"it is the wand of blast wave. Chasms are fine but the wand isn't doing a good job of telling the game ""a mob is here, check if it should fall"" right now."
PixelDungeon,392ojo,Scharnvirk,3,Tue Jun 9 01:28:04 2015 UTC,Like in these cartoons where unfortunate protagonist looses the ground under his feet and gravity is calmly waiting for his consciousness to catch up? :D

PixelDungeon,390gdk,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:50:09 2015 UTC,The new elementals are a really interesting way to add enemy variety and while there abilities aren't earth shatteringly unique they add to the games strategy which I like.  The only one I haven't figured out the best way to deal with is the Air Elemental who so far I've just tried to snipe down.
PixelDungeon,390gdk,Tehtacticalpanda,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:38:43 2015 UTC,It is looks like Air Elemental attack range should be reduced...
PixelDungeon,390gdk,Punkndrublic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:48:41 2015 UTC,What does the codex do? So far the only problem I've had with pixel is that air elementals have ridiulous range.

PixelDungeon,39342f,TestTheTester,2,Tue Jun 9 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"At low level it is weak, but if you commit to it and upgrade it to +10 or more, this is a really good wand, more stable than fireblast and a ton a damage. But yeah, at low level, it's not that good."
PixelDungeon,392jez,davidsverse,2,Mon Jun 8 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but they seem to dodge if you activate it and then try to hit them. If you activate it, take one step or wait one turn and try to hit them, it'll work."

PixelDungeon,392jez,00-Evan,2,Tue Jun 9 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"it's a bit weird but not quite a bug.  Basically the wraiths are added in on a 2 turn delay to give the player a chance to run from them without eating a bunch of free hits. The wraiths don't have a chance to act, so they don't yet have a concept of whether or not they've seen the hero."

PixelDungeon,391dgv,dachhack,6,Mon Jun 8 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"IDK, it's pretty clearly influenced by NetHack, where the Scroll of Identify does the same thing (and of course NetHack is strongly influenced by D&D, where Identify is a common spell)."
PixelDungeon,391dgv,Paradigmist,3,Mon Jun 8 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"Scroll of Identify is found in almost every single roguelike, and it's always been called that."
PixelDungeon,391dgv,hpp3,2,Mon Jun 8 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I didn't realize it was ""Identify"" and not ""Identity"" until embarassingly late."
PixelDungeon,391dgv,Thimoteus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"it's because Scrolls are a written version of a spell you would cast. So the mage would say, ""I cast Identify on this longsword!""  It it was Identity, it would make more sense contextually with a living, unknown person. ""I cast Identity on this unknown Rogue to discover who he is."""
PixelDungeon,391dgv,jengelke,0,Thu Jun 11 14:35:15 2015 UTC,Grammatically speaking Scroll Of Identity is correct and works contextually. Only a non native English speaker would find room for ambiguity.
PixelDungeon,391dgv,Aciada,-1,Thu Jun 11 09:00:26 2015 UTC,There are a lot of poor English choices in the vanilla version.
PixelDungeon,391dgv,v3xx,6,Mon Jun 8 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"It's based on previous roguelike games which if i remember rightly have ""scroll of identify""   ""Scroll of x"" is the format where x is the name of the spell, in dnd ""identify"" is a spell.   Just saying it's not a poor English choice by wataboo if it is one at all."
PixelDungeon,391dgv,TeutorixAleria,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:13:06 2015 UTC,No man there are or at least used to be a lot of errors. Evan even said he would be changing a lot of signs and stuff to improve the english.
PixelDungeon,391dgv,v3xx,3,Mon Jun 8 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there are no mistakes, this isn't one though.   The signs definitely need an update"
PixelDungeon,391dgv,TeutorixAleria,3,Mon Jun 8 19:31:36 2015 UTC,Just to be clear though scroll of identify is the proper name in my opinion. The spell is identify so it makes sense.
PixelDungeon,39192a,Leuten,2,Mon Jun 8 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"so...  Venom starting damage now scales more based on the wand level instead of the current depth, and always ticks up by 1 damage instead of an amount scaling with the depth. This means that unupgraded venom wands are no longer going to chunk lategame enemies nearly as hard, but upgraded ones should be just as, if not a bit more deadly. Creative use of mildly upgraded wands can still be useful even in the lategame though.  Corruption is now MUCH less effective against healthy enemies, but is similar to its old effectiveness against extremely low health + debuffed enemies. Of course it's still possible to try it on a healthy target, but you risk dumping a lot of charges. also lots of bugs and interaction quirks were corrected."
PixelDungeon,39192a,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"I understand that's for balancing, it was kinda powerful.. So, is it already, or could it be effected by you level? for example: if you're 2 levels above the target it'd be more effective? Every % of the enemie's hp they lose could decrease the number of charges required after a certain % is met or something.. and status ailments could have the same kind of effect... unless its already pretty much like this inwhich case im sorry for bothering you have a nice day.. o.o . On a Side note, what are the Staff of Living Earth, and Staff of Warding like? They're the only ones i haven't encountered yet."
PixelDungeon,39192a,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:57:33 2015 UTC,"it's level of the wand and number of charges available vs enemy hp, max hp, and whether they're debuffed.  I won't give out the exact formula but you really want to try and get enemies low and debuffed for best results now.  Warding and Living Earth both got delayed to 0.3.1 due to some technical issues, I mentioned this in the release notes. They're still coming though."

PixelDungeon,38zc4d,00-Evan,3,Mon Jun 8 10:26:27 2015 UTC,"those 'under-the-hood' changes mentioned in 0.3.0c were a complete rework of how traps are coded and implemented to support changes planned for 0.3.1.

PixelDungeon,39185p,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"Does that count the current upgrade level, or is it exclusive of it?  Meaning should I save my upgrade scrolls and dew-upgrade until I'm at 5+D/3, then use the scrolls?  Or do I get 5+D/3 in addition to any scrolls I've used?"
PixelDungeon,39185p,hpp3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it tracks how much upgrade you get from blessing separately. In other words, save your upgrade scrolls until after you get level 5+D/3, for a D that you feel is sufficiently high."
PixelDungeon,39185p,dachhack,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:37:23 2015 UTC,"WOW!  Thank you for the playthough and feedback. I am working on 3 levels of post-yog play that will unlock a final boss. Also looking at more difficult optional mini-quests throughout.   Are the wells ""pit"" puzzles? Where you fall down from the floor above into the rooms?  I reworked those so that there is a teleport scroll in the room you fall into but the room is blocked off from the rest of the level.   Looks like the ring of wealth might be OP (but fun). Maybe I should tone it down a little...  One option is to make mobs and bosses scale based on the hero's level. This would be a major shift in play style, but it might be worth exploring...  A few questions if you don't mind: How much gold did you end up with? How much 'dew upgrading' did you use? Did you use the blacksmith to transfer upgrades? Was the primary source of upgrades wraiths?  Thanks again!"
PixelDungeon,39185p,imhoopjones,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"You know what... it never occured to me to see if I can pit-fall into these rooms, so it may not be a glitch afterall. Oops.  The monster scaling could be tricky. Look at other games that did it... like Oblivion. I know, completely different game, but it made it so no matter how geared you were, you still felt as powerful as you were at level 1 (except if you were massively over leveled, the end-boss was literally unbeatable, without any mods.). Careful with that idea.   I ended up with something like 24k gold, but I collected 46,659 for the game (I buy the stores out, completely.)  I did a whole lot of dew upgrading. I didn't use any scrolls until I was maxed out doing the dew upgrades (which I thought was +9, but apparently it's +12 at level 31? Didn't try upgrading much after that...)  Yes, I used the blacksmith for my plate armor. Did a +9 and +9 plate armor, which gave a +15 back, if I remember correctly.  Yes. With that ring upgraded, every single wraith dropped a scroll.  EDIT: Spelling."

Pretty much a waste of my evening and I am quite annoyed."
PixelDungeon,390qjb,northcot,3,Mon Jun 8 12:06:43 2015 UTC,The only change to yog is that he (just recently too) was given 1hp regen per turn to counteract people hiding and dawdling while fighting him after the fists are dead.
PixelDungeon,390qjb,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"Thats pretty big. Might equate to hundreds of hp if the fight is a long one.  Also, means the common method of earth-rooting in a corner is now alot less effective"

PixelDungeon,38xkrd,Leuten,7,Sun Jun 7 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"Wands   Wand of Magic Missile - Has 4 charges, does damage. nothing too special?                                                  Gives above average regen for wand charges on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Lighting - Pretty much still the same thing as before, Targets anything adjacent to your target, does more on stuff in water                       Has a chance to zap enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Fireblast - Now uses all charges on the wand, more charges used, give a large area (all tiles hit lit on fire)                       Gives chance to light enemy on fire on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Regrowth - Same as Wand of Fireblast in use, but creates grass and roots anything inside it (for a short time) also has a chance of creating plants (like sorrowmoss etc.)                            Gives herbal healing on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Transmutation - Uses a chunk of your life to Hurt enemies, or heal allies (like the Sad Ghost spawned from Dried Rose) and i believe if you fire it at a cursed item thats sitting on the ground, it removes the curse..            Gives chance to ""pre-charge"" your staff (next shot doesn't cost you health) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.       Wand of Disintegration - and fire through walls  and enemies, the more enemies (and apparently tiles?) it fires through, the more damage it deals.                         Gives grim effect (chance to instant kill on hit) when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Prismatic Light - Fires a beam of like that can have the magic mapping effect on shadows (not sure how to do this, it has just kinda happened afew times) deals some damage and has a chance to blind the target.                Gives chance to paralyze enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Venom - creates a gas in the air (similiar to toxic gas) called venom, venom becomes a status ailment on anything inside the gas, and deals damage like poison, but does more damage the longer the status exists.             Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.          Wand of Blastwave - Deals area damage that pushes anything and effects tiles that are close enough to the impact a distance away (paralyzes enemies hit into walls)                                       Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Frost - Gives target ""Chilled"" effect, which slows them down, and if the target is standing on a water tile, it freezes them.                                               Gives chilled effect to enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  Wand of Corruption - Uses it's charges to take over enemies (permanently) the stronger the enemy, the more charges it takes (doesn't work on bosses, but it does work on things spawned by bosses, like the Dwarf King's skeletons and possibly God Larvae) and if the target is succesfully corrupted, their health is restored.                       Gives amok effect to enemy on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.        Wand of Living Earth - I have not yet received this wand, but i can't wait to try it out!!                                 Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.      Wand of Warding - I have not yet received this wand, but i can't wait to try it out!!                                Gives (?) on hit when imbued into Battlemage's Staff.  So, i may not have done a good job explaining the wands, but i tried.                                    Note: All Wands I explained do damage (I can not exactly explain how much) except for Corruption and Regrowth.                                Blandfruit   (Warning: Fruit names may be incorrect)                       Fruitname = Seed used + Blandfruit - Fruit's effect  Rotfruit = Rotberry + Blandfruit - Gives player + 1 Strength when eaten.                             Sunfruit = Sungrass + Blandfruit - Fully restores health player when eaten.                  Icefruit = * + Blandfruit* - When eaten works like Frozen Carpaccio, or can be throw to be used like Potion of Frost                                            Sorrowfruit = Sorrowmoss + Blandfruit -When eaten, You have a toxic gas aura around you that you are immune to.                                              Firefruit = Firebloom + Blandfruit - When eaten, Your melee attacks now (have a chance to?) light your target on fire.                                             Dreamfruit = Dreamweed + Blandfruit - Purification potion effect when eaten (possibly when thrown too?).                                             Blindfruit = Blindweed + Blandfruit - When eaten, you turn invisible.                                             Earthfruit = Earthroot + Blandfruit - When eaten, Your melee attacks now (have a chance to?) root your enemies.                                             Stormfruit = Stormvine + Blandfruit - Gives levitate effect when eaten (Vertigo gas when thrown?).                                             Starfruit = Starfruit(?) + Blandfruit - Levels up the player when eaten.                                             **** = * + Blandfruit* - ______________"
PixelDungeon,38xkrd,HuginnsaysWhat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:25:30 2015 UTC,The wand of prismatic light has a chance to cause the paralyzed effect on a hit when it has been imbued into the staff.

PixelDungeon,39091l,Kultissim,3,Mon Jun 8 08:30:41 2015 UTC,Battlemage kept the melee wand charge.  It just charges over time now instead of instantly giving you a charge so you actually have to melee them and not just go melee > blast > melee > blast > done.
PixelDungeon,39091l,Heavy_Lobster,2,Mon Jun 8 08:59:43 2015 UTC,Not since 3.0c update from yesterday its gone now
PixelDungeon,39091l,Todbrot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:10:16 2015 UTC,"I just tested it, got no buff on the first floor, just some fancy particles. Did get the recharging buff after upgrading the wand to +1 on floor 2"
PixelDungeon,39091l,00-Evan,2,Mon Jun 8 11:08:28 2015 UTC,"the battlemage still gets recharge but it is now exclusively for his staff. However, the magic missile bonus effect now grants the old recharging buff, so if you liked having multiple wands gaining charge through melee combat consider investing in a magic missile staff."
PixelDungeon,39091l,Todbrot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:30:22 2015 UTC,"Got it, it was the book. I lost the book of mastery after update to 3.0c (could be related to the fact I did a phone update too) so I wasn't realising I couldnt get the recharge because I was just a random mage and not the freakin BattleMage. Oh and I've sent you a message a PM a few days ago Evan."
PixelDungeon,39091l,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:56:59 2015 UTC,"Hm, i only get the recharging buff (1/4 recharge for 1 turn) after upgrading my wand , is that intended?"
PixelDungeon,39091l,Todbrot,2,Mon Jun 8 12:48:17 2015 UTC,"so the battlemage no longer gets recharging for all wands, as I said, you just get a flat increase to your staff's charge.  The magic missile effect was changed though to emulate the old behaviour, and now you'll get a recharging buff which will last an amount of time dependant on the staff's level."
PixelDungeon,39091l,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"So the recharging buff lasts ""0 turns"" without upgrades?"
PixelDungeon,39091l,Todbrot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, although the game takes a shortcut and just doesn't apply it."

PixelDungeon,38vwah,SuperSlims,6,Sun Jun 7 07:20:12 2015 UTC,"AFAIK the wiki is mostly updated to vanilla 1.7.5a. There is only one page dedicated to Shattered, however, and that page is pretty outdated. When you say ""new wands,"" I'm guessing that you want the Shattered page to be updated more.  It may not be the answer you're looking for, but the best way to get the information updated is to do it yourself! The PD Wiki is just like any other wiki, in that it relies on user contributions to function. Not many shattered users have updated the page on the wiki, so it remains how it was in the beginning of Shattered's development. My advice is that you start adding to the page yourself, and hopefully that will encourage other redditors to do the same."
PixelDungeon,38vwah,roastedlasagna,4,Sun Jun 7 16:34:01 2015 UTC,I wrote most of the content on that one page dedicated to shattered. I don't really have the interest in keeping up with it
PixelDungeon,38vwah,Authenticait,4,Sun Jun 7 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"I can try to vaguely answer your questions.                        I'm not sure what you mean by ""Bee Hive"" though I'll assume you mean the Honey Pot?                             When you throw the honey pot, it will shatter on the tile it was thrown to, and spawn a golden bee which will fight anything that comes near the shattered pot                                   Ok, These may not be the right names, but close enough.                         Wand of Magic Missile - Has 4 charges, does damage. nothing too special?  Wand of Lighting - Pretty much still the same thing as before, Targets anything adjacent to your target, does more on stuff in water                       Wand of Fireblast - Now uses all charges on the wand, more charges used, give a large area (all tiles hit lit on fire)                       Wand of Regrowth - Same as Wand of Fireblast in use, but creates grass and roots anything inside it (for a short time) also has a chance of creating plants (like sorrowmoss etc.)                            Wand of Transmutation - Uses a chunk of your life to Hurt enemies, or heal allies (like the Sad Ghost spawned from Dried Rose) and i believe if you fire it at a cursed item thats sitting on the ground, it removes the curse..                 Wand of Disintegration - and fire through walls  and enemies, the more enemies (and apparently tiles?) it fires through, the more damage it deals.                         Wand of Prismatic Light - Fires a beam of like that can have the magic mapping effect on shadows (not sure how to do this, it has just kinda happened afew times) deals some damage and has a chance to blind the target.                Wand of Venom - creates a gas in the air (similiar to toxic gas) called venom, venom becomes a status ailment on anything inside the gas, and deals damage like poison, but does more damage the longer the status exists.                     Wand of Blastwave - Deals area damage that pushes anything that is too close to the impact a distance away (not sure if stronger wand pushes further or not..)                                       Wand of Frost - Gives target ""Chilled"" effect, which slows them down, and if the target is standing on a water tile, it freezes them.                                               Wand of Corruption - Uses it's charges to take over enemies (permanently) the stronger the enemy, the more charges it takes (doesn't work on bosses, but it does work on things spawned by bosses, like the Dwarf King's skeletons and possibly God Larvae) and if the target is succesfully corrupted, their health is restored.

PixelDungeon,38vwah,00-Evan,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"Perhaps start a new wiki for shattered? (And possibly sprouted? If dach reads this he should attempt to get some wiki stuff set up to at least list changes from shattered, but not new stuff if he wants to leave that to community.)"
PixelDungeon,38vwah,SGAdventures,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"we might be able to solve the problem through wiki namescapes, but it's something I'll need to talk about with them to see what they think is right.  I think the single page approach can work up until a mod gets to a certain size, that could totally be the case for sprouted, but generally I feel like having multiple wikis and namespaces should be avoided, just for the sake of not separating things too much."
PixelDungeon,38vwah,jengelke,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:36:31 2015 UTC,We want to try and avoid completely separating the community like that Ideally :/ They're playing with how to deal with it on the wikia atm :)

Releasing on iOS in this manner violates the GPL due to the closed nature of the platform(plus not holding the copyright), and apple has had a history of removing open source GPL software whenever they are aware of it.   Hopefully either Watabou plans to release an official iOS version (which would be within the license), or this guy can communicate with him and have an official version released in partnership with him."
PixelDungeon,38t88w,00-Evan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:02:47 2015 UTC,"Evan, looks like Watabou official iOS version is almost ready, and high probability that my implementation will be removed from the market to give a way for his app."

PixelDungeon,38t88w,00-Evan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"So this is not impossible... That's all I want to know :D There is a lot of potential players on iOS, and currently absolutely no good rogue-likes on the iPhone, so I'm waiting for you! Your job on Shattered Pixel Dungeon is amazing!"
PixelDungeon,38t88w,Tom1206,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:45:53 2015 UTC,I've juste noticed that there is an option to compile for iOS in the libGDX port. So how can I use this to put this beloved Shattered PD in my iPhone? If not why there is even this option availble (that seems fully fonctionnal as we've seen this new iOS PD version)?
PixelDungeon,38t88w,Tom1206,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:11:55 2015 UTC,"it's not nearly that simple.  Firstly there will likely be a number of iOS specific issues that need to be resolved, although with vanilla coming to iOS that is made much easier as there's some precedent for what code changes need to be made.  After that there are the legal issues I've referred to before."
PixelDungeon,38t88w,00-Evan,2,Mon Jun 8 13:14:36 2015 UTC,"Not the dev, just stumbled upon it and haven't had a chance to properly test it out yet. This came out of the blue for me despite some of the ground work being on GH for some time now. Can't see much discussed here about this in recent weeks so it was definitely a shock. Port based on 1.7.5.a based on the description."
PixelDungeon,38t88w,BilbolDev,2,Sat Jun 6 16:57:22 2015 UTC,37 mb... omg.. why is it so big O_o  PS: Is it open source too?
PixelDungeon,38t88w,skynet67,3,Sat Jun 6 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking as well. My guess is that in order to get it to actually work, things got a bit... Hackish.  Edit: looking at the repo, it's still all Java so there's definitely a couple of extra libraries tacked on"
PixelDungeon,38t88w,skynet67,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:13:03 2015 UTC,"@syd430, you don't need any additional libraries. iOS version uses Gradle and RoboVM to compile Java classes to native libraries"
PixelDungeon,38t88w,Tom1206,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:17:05 2015 UTC,"I see, I actually was thinking it used something like RoboVM, but I wasn't too familiar with hybrid development outside Cordova/Ionic. From what I can see this is more like the Java equivalent of Titanium or React Native, so you've taken the right approach here and explains the good performance. Anyway thanks for the effort you've put into making this port."
PixelDungeon,38t88w,redsky1397,2,Sun Jun 7 00:54:52 2015 UTC,"I removed it from the store, because watabou is waiting when his official iOS version will be approved by AppStore."
PixelDungeon,38sl0b,Nethernox,2,Sat Jun 6 13:25:35 2015 UTC,What problem are you actually having with the new Fire wand?
PixelDungeon,38sl0b,nahlej,2,Sat Jun 6 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"i don't like how it ALWAYS uses all the charges, it makes a somewhat limited use weapon that way, and it's range (distance) is so much less almost all around."
PixelDungeon,38sl0b,Leuten,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:50:04 2015 UTC,"Why not just use any other wand? It's not like the original overpowered firebolt wand was exclusively a freerunner strategy. I'd upgrade a firebolt wand with any class to win the game on easy mode.  A freerunner with a venom wand? Holy crap, Batman! I'm losing health every round and can't catch that guy!    Not only is that guy faster than I am, but with that blast wave wand, I'm not closing the distance at all!  Lightning, but that annoying monster is right next to you? No problem!  Kiting with a disintegration wand? You bet! Prismatic light? Even better!  Did that rogue just freeze my butt in the middle of a lake, then blast me and my three adjacent friends with lightning? OMG!"

PixelDungeon,38tiwx,Dreteus,3,Sat Jun 6 18:10:46 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's pretty easy if you know what you are doing.  I'm adding more challenges and secrets for advanced play. But did you have fun?
PixelDungeon,38tiwx,dachhack,2,Sat Jun 6 18:24:48 2015 UTC,Yes I loved it! It might have been I'm fresh from beating skilled pixel dungeon multiple times on hell difficultly. But I can think of many times someone with just a little less knowledge would have died in my situation.
PixelDungeon,38tiwx,dachhack,2,Sat Jun 6 18:28:43 2015 UTC,Cool. It's for veterans like you I'm adding more hidden things and post-yog play. Hoping it will appeal to beginning players and experts alike.
PixelDungeon,38tiwx,jakethe5th,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"I actually love how easy it gets when you start figuring some things out, it's a good break from the insane difficulty of the other mods, plus using the challenges or simply not farming really ups the difficulty if that's what you're looking for"
PixelDungeon,38si6n,jestertiko,2,Sat Jun 6 12:54:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for playing and the feedback. Next release I'll have some balance elements hopefully will make the grinding more fun and balanced with some challenge elements.   You also read my mind on the after-yog play. I'm working on three new levels of advanced difficulty. You can purchase books that transport you to the new levels from the imp shop. The books are expensive so you will have a use for all that gold and the levels are super hard so you'll need to be about yog-beating strength to go there. The first level I made is a big catacombs with wraiths, blue wraiths and lots of graveyards.  Once all book levels are completed a new final boss will be unlocked. Have not decided what the final boss will be yet..."
PixelDungeon,38si6n,dachhack,2,Sat Jun 6 13:30:05 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely on the same front with jester on dew upgrading. I understand the grinding, but running in a circle for an hour or more in order to get free top tier gear ≠ fun. Also, will the next update bring sprouted to the new shattered version, or will that take a bit?"
PixelDungeon,38si6n,Omen267901,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"Loud and clear. here is what I'm thinking: Decrease the meat drops in favor of mobs randomly dropping dew of different values (1,2,5 like rupees in zelda) and remove water action from the vial. Maybe have a powered up vial yout can get later in the game.   I think this would still allow for reliable grinding to upgrade but with less tedium. I would also consider adding champion type mobs to keep grinding interesting.  Thoughts?"
PixelDungeon,38si6n,dachhack,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds great. The upgraded vial would allow you to water, and maybe have it function as a +3 wand of regrowth or so in the sense you can get rotberry and starflower. Champions sound good too. You may want to make certain enemies unable to be champions though (such as assassins, the rat boss etc.)"
PixelDungeon,38si6n,Omen267901,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think a decrease in meat drops is definitely good, most of the time food doesn't feel like a resource at the moment. I found that if i was a 3x4  of grass i could just keep going without a deficit in dew drops and starvation would be counteracted by my farming of dew. using mobs for dew drops might be better than the current system, but if you have to fight multiple enemies in a row, as a mage I use fire quite a lot. This change would lead me to destroying the dew drops most likely."
PixelDungeon,38si6n,hpp3,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with having dew drop from mobs is that usually, you end up injured after the fight and can't actually store the dew."

PixelDungeon,38r05t,TheCanadianAlligator,7,Sat Jun 6 02:00:28 2015 UTC,Or secret levels! Mooo.
PixelDungeon,38r05t,broken_long_thumbkey,7,Sat Jun 6 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"To get to the secret level, you have to get the Amulet of Yendor as warrior on April 1st while always having the shortsword in your inventory. Then, you have to go to the Rat King, feed him 8 food items so you get 8 fake amulets. Throw the fake amulet in a circleish sort of shape so there is a space in the middle, and throw the real amulet in the middle. You will hear a moo, this is your cue to throw the shortsword at the real amulet. If you did it right, the shortsword and amulet will disappear and a portal will be there in its place. Once you go in, you will see sheep everywhere. Kill them all. A bucket of milk will appear in the middle. Now, bring the bucket of milk all the way back to the bottom of the Demon Halls, and DROP it on the pedestal where the Amulet of Yendor is. You will hear a faint clicking if it worked. Now, go all the way back to the portal in the Rat King's room. If you go in again, you will see that the sheep have been replaced by infinitely respawning cows, and there is a pegleg in the middle of the room instead. The pegleg is a 10 str weapon that does 1 damage but always hits (so basically it's a dagger reskin). Take this opportunity to farm the cows for their unique potions of beef that heal your health and hunger fully and give you +1 strength. Next, take the pegleg and bring it down to the last floor again. Now, you will see a final demon cow that spawned from the milk bucket. You have to kill it with the pegleg while naked. If you aren't wielding the pegleg you will not do damage, and if you aren't naked, the demon cow's attack will always put you down to 1 HP if the attack's damage wouldn't do it itself. This is why you farmed the beef potions: for healing, and for the extra damage from the strength bonus. When you kill the demon cow, a portal will open which teleports you to the secret cow level, where you can farm forever. If you want to go back out of the cow level, then I hope you have a Lloyd's Talisman set to an earlier floor because the only other way out is a 3 IRL hour long walk that brings you to ANOTHER cow level."

PixelDungeon,38rdh0,SGAdventures,6,Sat Jun 6 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"When nobody submits to them, I get sad. When I get sad, I don't feel like updating them. :(  Unfortunately, I think that the days of the CC are coming to an end. We originally created them because veterans were getting bored of Pixel Dungeon, but with all of the new mods and content that is no longer the case. In addition, the item degradation change led many away from vanilla PD, reducing the amount of submissions we receive.  The current problem we're facing is that people want the challenges to be vanilla only, but when they are vanilla only nobody submits to them. To fix this problem, myself and the mods are brainstorming ways to make the Community Challenges more interesting and engaging. Until then, the last challenge (CC#17) will remain in a state of stasis.  If anyone has any suggestions for us, please let us know. Otherwise, we will do our best to bring it back...but I'm not very optimistic."
PixelDungeon,38rdh0,roastedlasagna,5,Sat Jun 6 04:30:52 2015 UTC,"Haha. I kinda agree. As the challenge author of CC#17, I get sad when nobody attempts them.  Not many are interested these days especially with the mods adding variety and challenges and item degradation.  Perhaps the mods have taken the place of CC, which in the past filled the role of giving players a challenge because vanilla was getting stale.  When we have more mods, how about a monthly featured mod? A mega thread with challenges, strategy, suggestions and generic discussions for a specific mod.  I am currently working on a mod and think that this might help generate ideas and gain feedback for whosever's mod gets featured.."
PixelDungeon,38rdh0,gohjohn,2,Sat Jun 6 11:16:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the mods have taken the place of CC, which in the past filled the role of giving players a challenge because vanilla was getting stale.   Yep, pretty much the point I was trying to make. 100% agree.  A monthly featured mod is a decent idea, I'll discuss it with the other moderators. It would effectively replace the CC though, and I want to at least try and revive interest in the CC first before looking to completely different options."
PixelDungeon,38rdh0,roastedlasagna,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:27:33 2015 UTC,yeah fair enough. I don't understand the hype about the degradation :/   I support the idea of the modding going on with shattered and such but they do make the game quite the bit earlier.  Maybe you could make a rule that 'Legacy Mode' submissions (the PC version without Degradation) are acceptable however a vanilla non-legacy mode submission of the same stats will always win the challenge?  That way it's still the same original PD (without mods) but people can still win by playing in Legacy mode...
PixelDungeon,38rdh0,roastedlasagna,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:36:45 2015 UTC,"The PC version without degradation is already acceptable, the version does not matter as long as it is vanilla (although for the last challenge, it was degradation-specific). I think the bigger issue is that most of /r/PixelDungeon switched away from vanilla when degradation was added, and now plays other mods (Shattered and Skillful being the two most popular)."

There are a lot of ways that could go besides just the honeypot item. Like making a weapon you're not using fly around and fight on your behalf (so you'd consume spare weapons by using them until they're ""killed"" instead of selling them). Maybe you could even animate a chest and turn it into a mimic that's on your side. Or be all necromancer-ish and animate a corpse before you ""open"" it and turn it into a skeleton that's on your side.  Subclasses might include an illusion specialist. Nothing fancy, just treat him like he's always wearing multiplicity armor so he spawns mirror images when he's hit. And maybe some kind of corruption specialist. Like hitting a monster has a chance of inflicting amok. Or maybe when you kill a monster, you get a temporary skeleton.  I dunno. There's merit to the whole friendly monster thing. But basing an entire class around bees and just bees is a little weird."

Were talking about people playing 500 games to get their first win before degradation and now many people will find it far too hard to even bother sticking with it.

PixelDungeon,38mmfj,Leuten,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:53:10 2015 UTC,That would be wickedly overpowered. Knuckledusters attack twice. Regular fists once. Knuckledusters can be upgraded and enchanted. Regular fists can't.  Rings of force are pretty specifically meant to be used unarmed. There would need to be some tweaking done if they're made to be usable with knuckledusters.
PixelDungeon,38mmfj,NCOSRane,2,Fri Jun 5 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well I guess this may not be a good comparison, but in real life, if you can punch someone and break a bone, would wearing Knuckledusters on your hands make you only bruise them?"
PixelDungeon,38mmfj,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get the concept behind the idea. Knuckledusters are used to punch someone, just like your fists are, so wouldn't a ring of force affect that?  I guess it depends on the science behind the ring of force. If you're bare-handed, the ring might hit your target and do massive damage. If you're wearing knuckles over the ring, it wouldn't. If the ring just increases the force of your arms, it should up any weapon's damage, not just bare hands (maybe the damage increase could be inversely proportional to the damage of the weapon?) Or maybe the ring just does this little force bubble a millimeter from the skin on your hands. Who knows? Pixel Dungeon doesn't tell us how the magic works. It just does. Pixel Dungeon tells us the ring ups your damage if you're not using a weapon.  But it's a semantic thing. This is only even a suggestion because the knuckleduster happens to be called ""knuckleduster"" and have a picture of metal knuckles. If the knuckleduster had been ""stabbyknives"" this whole time -- identical stats, just not a ""knuckleduster"" -- this wouldn't even be suggested."
PixelDungeon,38mmfj,hpp3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:51:56 2015 UTC,There actually already is a difference between knuckledusters and stabbyknives. Dwarf Monks are unable to disarm you if you're wielding knuckledusters. So there is precedent for knuckledusters having special treatment.
PixelDungeon,38mmfj,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"Knuckledusters also have the damage of a wet paper towel, even at +9 with Gladiator combo damage. I would go as far as to say an enchantment on the knuckledusters would do more damage than the knuckledusters themselves. Besides, rings don't exactly have the highest chance of spawning, and the chance you get Ring of Force specifically is even lower."

PixelDungeon,38h4et,JonSnowww1,10,Thu Jun 4 04:17:02 2015 UTC,PD is hard enough.  I think the fact that it did not come with PD when it started and it came when people were already suffering from the difficulty of the game thus people reacted negatively.  I am sure if hunger did not come with the original version people would have reacted negatively to it as well. More than usual anyway.
PixelDungeon,38h4et,BilbolDev,7,Thu Jun 4 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"I think there were three additional reasons.  First I can't think of any other popular roguelikes with degradation, which means it's a completely new mechanic and therefore bad.  Second the scrolls used are scrolls of upgrade as opposed to scrolls of restoration or repair which is unintuitive.  Third is just the huge shift from using upgrade scrolls instantly to avoid losing them to saving them and letting them burn up and be stolen."
PixelDungeon,38h4et,Heavy_Lobster,2,Thu Jun 4 06:31:03 2015 UTC,I am sure an option to repair weapons at any time in exchange for gold would dilute the issue. But people might like the challenge so I made it an on/off switch in skillful.   I believe it's best to present it as a challenge with its own badge.

I guess what you mean is mainly the quick skill button. I only have one emulator and one phone. The phone is 'high resolution' and the emulator is 'low resolution'. Guess there was a lower resolution :(  There will be a lot of fixes once I pick up development again.

PixelDungeon,38h4et,Kultissim,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:31:12 2015 UTC,Degradation specifically? I can't think of any but many roguelikes have ways of ruining your items. Probably the more well known being an acidic enemy that damages your weapon when you hit it and damages your armor when it hits you.  Brogue for example though feels like practically every other feature was designed around making you lose items.
PixelDungeon,38h4et,mrfluffleupagus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:41:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much brogue myself, so I can't comment on that.  The aspect of degradation which makes it unique is it punishes players for using their equipment even when they're using it well.  Get an eight hit combo on the dwarf king?  -1 to your mace.  Use your wand of blink to kite enemies around and take no damage?  -1 to your wand.  On paper it makes sense — it stops players from farming for levels and gold and keeps the next floors challenging — but it ""feels"" terrible because there's no way to prevent it and the only way to fix it is to use a valuable, limited resource."
PixelDungeon,38h4et,Heavy_Lobster,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:17:18 2015 UTC,"The aspect of degradation which makes it unique is it punishes players for using their equipment even when they're using it well.   I promise you that's not unique at all. :P It's fine to not like it, of course, I'm just commenting on the fact that punishment like that in a true roguelike is quite common and actually usually much worse than Pixel Dungeon's."
PixelDungeon,38h4et,mrfluffleupagus,2,Fri Jun 5 06:39:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sick of equipment degradation in general. I haven't had to repair a weapon in Bloodborne once, and that fact alone makes it GOTY for me."
PixelDungeon,38h4et,IAMA_BAD_MAN_AMA,2,Thu Jun 4 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. IMO degradation makes the game harder and brings more decision making, which I like since I was always looking for some really hard game to play on my phone. I can also understand people that don't like it tho, since when I started playing PD degradation was already in the game. In some other games I feel really sad when some strategy or item gets nerfed or completely removed, which is probably also how those people feel."

PixelDungeon,38h4et,dachhack,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"It's not that bad guys :P   y'all were made soft by the dew vial. For me it just brings the difficulty back closer to where it used to be. For quite a large stint there all the updates were making the game easier. Then the first one to seriously go the other and everyone protests? There are also more upgrade scrolls around now so that helps a bit.  It's still more than possible to get very high win rates, just have to learn to think about degradation and upgrades in a practical sense :)"
PixelDungeon,38h4et,SGAdventures,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"The game includes a very limited quantity of upgrade scrolls. Before degradation, when you used them and what you used them on and how you spread them around was a key part of your strategy. After degradation, you pick one or two key items and save your scrolls, using them to maintain those one or two items when the degrade-o-meter gets low. Forgetting the difficulty or the shift in strategy, it's just plain annoying to have to micro-manage your inventory like that and check it constantly instead of just playing the game.  Worse than the degradation itself, however, is that nothing else in the game was balanced to suit the change. The game has the same limited number of upgrade scrolls, and the monsters are just as difficult as before. The monsters you used to be able to pass with some difficulty pre-degradation are a lot harder when your gear is less upgraded either due to degrading or you saving upgrade scrolls instead of using them.  Degradation also treats every item the same, whether it's a glaive, plate armor, a boomerang, or a wand. I might throw a boomerang 10 times to do the job of one hit with a glaive."
PixelDungeon,38h4et,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:48:39 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with many of your points, there is one difference. To introduce degradation as a new mechanic Watabou did balance it a bit. You can now get scrolls of enchant, making it possible to enchant then upgrade an item multiple times as apposed to dumping all your upgrades I to your tier-5 then waiting for a well of transmutation to get a weapon upgrade. That was a small balance. Also with degradation was introduced bombs and beehives, both of which are effective player boosts. Despite these little balances I haven't touched vanilla in a long time and only play on shattered and sometimes skillful"
PixelDungeon,38feii,Moriartysir,5,Wed Jun 3 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"Shattered is currently easier, but AFAIK Evan is working on that. In all seriousness, even if it was harder than the original game, I would rather play shattered due to all the fun new things and the lack of degradation."

PixelDungeon,38feii,RSquared,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"I think the early gear checks (goo and crabs) were toned down a lot in Shattered, which makes it easier to win out over the luck of the sewers and get a run extended to the point where item management and skill comes into play.  Once you're in the prison, you start to see a run's theme take shape due to the mix of wands/rings/weapons that you've found, so you can make more strategic decisions than ""I found this, time to equip it"".  Degradation also drives a lot of luck, since unidentified equipment is a risk that you have to take more often.  Not enough ID scrolls, which seem to be more common in Shattered."
PixelDungeon,38feii,portezbie,2,Thu Jun 4 13:31:52 2015 UTC,"It is a bit easier but really, there are just more items and features which means more things that can help you win. However, it also means more entertaining and interesting game play."

PixelDungeon,38f385,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:42:17 2015 UTC,"Seems silly the amount of changes to some items. Ring of Haste is still pretty good on anyone, but I had a game where I ended up with +2 and +3 Rings of Evasion (wasted 2 scrolls on the +2) and discovered it was essentially worthless to anyone but a rogue (was playing the warrior at the time). I sort of hold the ""evaporating"" buff on the same level as the buff from a Ring of Elements. Sure, it's nice if you have nothing else, but should never take priority in any situation (aside from the Rogue with cloak)."
PixelDungeon,38f385,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:22:41 2015 UTC,"Evasion used to be easily the best ring in the game, the changes are a nerf.  I wouldn't mind making some clarity improvements to that ring, but it is useful on all classes. Basically as long as no enemies see you you gain a stacking buff over time which caps based on the level of the ring. That same buff gives you bonus evasion, and degrades away every turn an enemy does see you.  It certainly works best with the rogue, but other classes are capable of being sneaky and using it too, especially as it also lowers passive enemy detection."
PixelDungeon,38f385,RSquared,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:27:24 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but it add a level of strategy to a run that works against you. With infinite time and energy, it would still be somewhat annoying. With a limit of food/health and overall time in general coupled with the fact that you have few options to ""get away"" from a fight mean that the ""bonus"" is worth very little, in my opinion. Especially since even with a ring of +4 and a ring of +3, I could very often expect to get hit on the second hit. Of course that means another turn of buff has degraded and I'm more likely to get hit again. With a +7 bonus, I would expect to avoid at least half or more of the first 6 or so attacks otherwise, what's the point.  I would much rather the ring get turned into a niche item that's more generally useful to all classes. Rogues already get a unique artifact, why make a ring much more useful to them as well? It would do better with a different, less overpowered effect. Maybe make the evasion buff accumulate when moving and degrade when standing still (would promote moving in battle, but would degrade hunger and could cause problems with getting cornered) or add something else to the current ring (large buff to avoid ranged attacks, like a static 50% or more). Just some thoughts, but as it stand, ring of evasion will be a ""throwaway"" item for me as soon as I can replace it (unless I'm running an assassin).  Also, what's the deal with the Ring of Tenacity? It seems like another item made almost exclusive for a class (berserker) with a much lower amount of use for other classes."
PixelDungeon,38f385,BadB0ii,3,Thu Jun 4 13:05:32 2015 UTC,"The evasion buff stacks at any time when you are not in combat, which includes when you're just walking down a hallway unopposed. The rogue gets extra chances to be unseen with his cloak but anybody can build stacks while out of combat. Actually, the reason why you were seeing it fall off so fast with two rings is because both act independently, meaning the passive would stack and fall off twice as fast.  Tenacity works on any character, but has better synergy with the berserker. I'm pretty sure every class is going to want to wait until low on health to maximize healing, tenacity would give you a few extra hits and allow you to let your potions last longer.   My intention isn't to make items that are only good on one class, but rather to make items that are generally effective, but have synergies in a few scenarios."
PixelDungeon,38f385,redsky1397,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, Ring of Marksmanship is pretty much Sniper-exclusive.  Each class gets a ring/artifact that's much more useful to them than the others.  Not every item needs to be useful to everyone - after all, there's only two slots to equip misc gear.  I would like a little more visual indicator of how charged the ring is - maybe a % charge like the cape of thorns.  Like, when it reaches 100% you dodge automatically or something (e.g. the retaliation attack after a crit).  OTOH, ring of wealth has no visible effect either, so maybe the effect on RNG shouldn't be stated."

PixelDungeon,38978u,HOLD-SHIFT,4,Tue Jun 2 18:45:03 2015 UTC,This is in fact an item you can get in the original pixel dungeon as well!  Frozen Carpaccio is way better than plain cooked meat because it can also give you some neat extras like invisibility or health.  This still counts as half a meal though!  Check out more on the item here: http://pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen_carpaccio
PixelDungeon,38978u,mdskrzypczyk,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"Does it count as a full meal?  Also, might be a Shattered PD thing"
PixelDungeon,38978u,Shadisica,4,Tue Jun 2 20:22:42 2015 UTC,It's been in vanilla PD for a year at least.  Its a half meal with a random beneficial effect.  Basically the opposite of uncooked meat.
PixelDungeon,38978u,TeutorixAleria,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:28:01 2015 UTC,"20% nothing except feeding you (half value), 20% healing, 20% invis, 20% barkskin, 20% removes debuffs (poison, cripple, bleeding, weakness, etc. -- also drowsy, vertigo, slow, etc. in Shattered)  It's not really reliable for any of the buffs or for debuff curing (though you can make use of a random invis or barkskin most of the time). It's mostly the random healing that's worthwhile. Easiest way to get a bunch of these is to plant an icecap seed, drop a pile of mystery meat in an adjacent square, then throw something to trigger the frost effect of the plant. I'd classify this feature as more of an easter egg than an especially useful trick, but every little bit helps in the dungeon."
PixelDungeon,38978u,NCOSRane,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"Meatscream is actually really good I think. Especially with the new introduction of the frost wand In shattered it means you have a reliable source of decent buffs. Like having a Firebolt for cooking, it's the same thing but far better"
PixelDungeon,38978u,BadB0ii,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"I found this out accidentally back in OG Pixel Dungeon (I think I threw some meat on a freezing trap to set it off).  You can cook it too using fire traps/wands/seeds as well. Same food value, but doesn't give a buff."

PixelDungeon,387glh,postingaccount243,3,Tue Jun 2 13:31:05 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't try to explore Demon Halls. I don't really know if you were, because the whole level is discovered when you die, but in the case you were, don't. It's just too dangerous, and there's really no great reward for doing so. After the Ambitious Imp's shop, just find the stairs to the next depth as fast as possible. Scrolls of Magic Mapping helps with this, but I like to save one for Yog, along with some Mind Vision potions so I have the most info about him and the fists. Also, if you can, use paralyzation gasses to get the burning fist out of your hair, and the rotten fist is pretty easy to take out on his own. Then, kill the fist while standing in water if possible, and Yog is pretty self-explanatory."

PixelDungeon,384wvt,BilbolDev,3,Tue Jun 2 21:53:06 2015 UTC,How complex is it to get a modded version of PD approved by steam?
PixelDungeon,384wvt,BilbolDev,3,Tue Jun 2 08:44:21 2015 UTC,Seeing as you'd be going through greenlight I imagine it would really depend on the community and possible public approval by Watabou. Steam is much more heavily curated so I imagine it would be much harder to get on as you would additionally have to justify the game isn't just a workshop level mod.
PixelDungeon,384wvt,BilbolDev,2,Tue Jun 2 11:20:35 2015 UTC,Not sure what you mean by workshop level mod. And I am sure steam sells games and mod of games (official expansions and such) so.... If  the mods are presented as expansions and approved by Watabou it should be alright... I think
PixelDungeon,384wvt,Omen267901,5,Tue Jun 2 11:23:42 2015 UTC,"Steam does not currently sell mods, they did an experiment on it with skyrim and due to a number of reasons it was a complete failure, they reverted it within a week. They have a system called the workshop where people can host mods of games and those are distributed for free, this includes expansion-sized mods for skyrim.  I agree that seeing as pixel dungeon has no workshop and generally PD mods are very large we may be able to set a different paradigm, but it would be working against the norm on steam.  For shattered at least, I personally feel there isn't enough different or improved yet for me to justify trying to sell it on steam, and I worry that valve would feel that way too."
PixelDungeon,384wvt,JoshuMertens,2,Tue Jun 2 11:34:03 2015 UTC,Given they are open source I don't see a point in selling. Would the constraints be less if they unlocked for free to whoever buys the original PD? kinda like free expansions to whoever buys the game.
PixelDungeon,384wvt,greater_nemo,2,Tue Jun 2 11:38:20 2015 UTC,"What you're referring to there is basically steam workshop. So yes it's entirely possible, Watabou would need to go through the steps required to get PD workshop support, i'm not sure what that entails."

PixelDungeon,382nif,NinjaDerpy,4,Mon Jun 1 12:27:06 2015 UTC,"This isn't normal pixel dungeon. Your gear would be amazing in normal pixel dungeon but is underwhelming in sprouted. In regular PD, you should roughly be the same level as the floor you're on. In sprouted, you should be much higher level than the floor you're on (maybe even twice as much). Notice how food is abundant? The idea is that you should be grinding mobs and farming dew to upgrade your gear, so you are actually strong enough for the boss fights. You can't play this game just running through the levels like usual.   Edit: it looks like you don't know about dew upgrading. If you charge your dew vial to 100, you can use 20 drops to upgrade all your gear with 1/3 chance. You can farm dew by using the vial's ""water"" ability, which works like regrowth and costs 2 dew. If you played optimally, you could've had a +20 vampiric warhammer, a +10 plate, and +10 rings (dew vial will let you upgrade everything to +10 by floor 15, and you can reforge a +10 short sword for another +10, unlike in PD)"

Spoilers and whatnot below....  For the goo, the mini goo do not split once the main goo is dead. So try to take him out first.   For the DM300 fight, DM300 is stronger when the printers are still in play so take then out first. I always suggest splashing with the dew vial to sneak up on the printers and let the robots wander away.   Just like all PD versions, you'll get better and better as you figure out the game and a win will come when you hit the sweetspot of luck and skill."

PixelDungeon,382nif,NCOSRane,2,Mon Jun 1 14:24:20 2015 UTC,"My first time through the game, I had a crapton of trouble with the bosses. Once you know exactly what to do, they're not so bad. With that gear, you could have beaten the DM if you'd used spalsh, made a beeline to printer 1, owned it quickly, did the same for printer 2, then picked off the robots one at a time.  That dew vial is pretty overpowered.  Unlike normal PD, you're not going to have a clean run where with the right stuff, you breeze through everything. Your runs in Sprouted are going to be dirty as heck. Expect to burn through supplies and get beaten up and barely eek out some wins .  Especially with bosses (though you might get mauled by some assassins on level 9, too).  Remember, one invis potion and a dungeon berry later, and you're fully healed, food is nearly unlimited, and your dew vial doubles as 10 full-heals (or 10 haste/invis uses) -- not to mention unlimited remove curse with some random gear upgrading.  And that water ability can even give you cover in a grassy room. If you're chugging healing items every turn and in danger of dying against a boss, that's normal. Unlike regular PD, where the right gear is pretty much a clean win.  Tengu is probably the hardest boss. Just because he's at the stage where you're not packing highly upgraded plate armor, he has a powerful ranged attack, he can't be cornered, and he doesn't stand around trading hits with you."

Now if somebody could explain what's the point with warlocks? They just don't need to eat as long as they  kill? No other fun trick or buff?  Oh and Evan plz my favourite was the rogue but I stopped playing  a few month and now that I'm back I found that the invisibility cape is way too slow to charge or buff. It like I can only use it one time or maybe two the first 2/3 floors and that's where the game is the hardest"
PixelDungeon,381k74,Kultissim,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:41:58 2015 UTC,"I agree the melee component isn't great for longterm scaling, but honestly I don't really think it's all that needed. I don't use a melee weapon with my battlemage because with the new update the wands have so much more intuitive utility. If you get something like a chilling, blast wave and corruption you can fight nearly unlimited foes with only magic missile staff (upgrades dumped into it).  TL;DR I think you need to get lucky and get a few wands to create strategic utility/ damage combos while using melee as general recharge only"

PixelDungeon,37ysxf,Adolph_Stalin,5,Sun May 31 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"with a +10 regrowth, probably not that long.  Considering that you have to sink scrolls into regrowth for the full effect now, you get a LOT of plants in return."
PixelDungeon,37ysxf,00-Evan,2,Sun May 31 20:16:45 2015 UTC,Little heads up here. I had a skill Herbalism for mage in skillful. So many seeds means a lot of potions.   Be careful if you boost anything related to seeds and stuff.
PixelDungeon,37ysxf,BilbolDev,3,Mon Jun 1 12:16:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that this sort of farming can cause problems, however all the upgraded wand of regrowth does is force the user to use up some scrolls in exchange for cutting out the time portion of getting lots of seeds/potions. Really it's no stronger than the old regrowth (except for starflower), it just requires far less time. Time isn't an ingame resource, so in my view a free win in 5 minutes of farming is just as strong as a free win in 5 hours, just less annoying. That's why I got rid of farming health potions, and also why I capped the player's level in 0.3.0.  I do agree that this can limit design space regarding potions though, but really it also limits design space in general as dawdling has no punishment with infinitely renewing dew. What I'm ultimately questioning right now is if hunger is really fulfilling its purpose lategame. Of course adjusting hunger to be harsher lategame is something that requires lots of balance testing."
PixelDungeon,37ysxf,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"Hunger turns new players off. Someone who doesn't know how to counter it (especially eating as soon as he sees hungry icon instead of starving) would suffer a lot.  Perhaps hunger should affect stats (attack skill, defense skill, maybe an automatic weaken alongside it) instead of hp loss. Or at least less HP loss (along side affecting stats) making it more tolerable in case you want to  increase its rate/difficulty.   I mean hitting something while you're starving should be hard right? Same with dodging"
PixelDungeon,37ysxf,BilbolDev,4,Mon Jun 1 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"Problem with stat loss is that it doesn't do anything to prevent dawdling.  Low stats are fine if you plan on turtling in an empty boss room while you farm the wand of regrowth, taking damage adds strategy as it turns it into a resource game, plus it means no matter what you do you have to eat at some point, unless you have regrowth of course. Hunger's goal is to keep the player moving, and stat drops encourage the opposite, as you're penalized for fighting while hungry.  My thought is to simply make the damage scale either based on depth or current max HP. Depending on how the scaling is done this could even make hunger easier to deal with in the earlygame, if that's what the balance goal ends up being. It's also worth noting that I've tried to educate the player regarding hunger (new tutorial signs and now buff descriptions) and I've seen a massive decrease in new players complaining about hunger as a result."

PixelDungeon,381gkl,HammBerger3,2,Mon Jun 1 03:59:53 2015 UTC,"If you're low on healing potions, whack it once and then back off and kill the larvae.  If you have a few left, stand between it and a wall and just keep smacking it around until it dies.  The eye itself deals no damage.  Only the fists and larvae do and you've already killed the fists.  The larvae don't deal much damage if you have a decent set of armor with some upgrades."
PixelDungeon,381gkl,Heavy_Lobster,2,Mon Jun 1 05:55:22 2015 UTC,"I suggest throwing a seed of earthroot right next to the eye of yog, jump on it and just start wailing away, ignoring the larva and using health potions whenever you get low."
PixelDungeon,381gkl,McSchwartz,2,Mon Jun 1 06:45:47 2015 UTC,"I usually try to ignore the fists.   Use invis potion, scroll of mind vision and/or something that stuns to make sure you get into a position (preferably in a corner or a wall) where you can get in several hits in before the fists reach you. The worms should surround you preventing the fists from reaching you. Yes the worms will hit you, but it is better than the alternative. After the Eye dies, the fists dissappear and you only have to clean up the worms.  Make sure you are sitting on a regen or armor plant.  I only ever hit the eye and I consistently win that boss fight."
PixelDungeon,381gkl,RexCogitans,3,Mon Jun 1 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"Defs a tactic I use most often, but remember that killing the fists quadruples the damage you do to the eye ;) So if you have a low hitting weapon like a knuckledusters you kind of have to kill the fists first."
PixelDungeon,381gkl,SGAdventures,2,Mon Jun 1 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hit the eye once and kill the larva that it spawns. Rinse and repeat. I always use this tehnique and I think it's better than sorrounding yourself with larva, since you take less damage and there are no fists to hit you anymore."
PixelDungeon,381gkl,Auxermen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:26:50 2015 UTC,But it takes no damage.... I have an axe that does average 14 damage
PixelDungeon,381gkl,greater_nemo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:09:56 2015 UTC,"Yog actually gains a defense buff as long as the fists are alive, so if you've taken them out already, you should be able to wail on it with reckless abandon. At that point, you don't really need a lot of damage to take it out.    But Yog can be beaten, and beaten hard, even in a single hit. A lot of making it through the fight is positioning, you're more likely to be killed by the larvae than anything."

PixelDungeon,3810pt,SGAdventures,2,Mon Jun 1 08:50:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too concerned with it, If you get like 9 rats and you're almost there then yes, wait around, but feel free to drop down the level. However you NEED to be level 3 before going to depth 3, so if you head down to depth 2 early you still need to sit around a bit and get the xp. The crabs will just destroy you otherwise. Depth two will probably give you another ration or two so you shouldn't die of starvation, and you should also have found a health potion by then too (not always, but pretty safe bet).  TL:DR - Depth two, no problem, only go to depth 3 if you are level 3 or higher."
PixelDungeon,3810pt,TheCanadianAlligator,-1,Tue Jun 2 03:24:32 2015 UTC,"If you're only finding 3-4 rats on depth 1, you're not clearing it.  Play better. Find ways to lose less health each encounter. 2 things off the top of my head:   Use doors to your advantage (guaranteed sneak attack if an enemy follows you through one) Don't eat your ration unless you're at around half health. Regeneration only stops being a thing when you're starving, and let's face it - when you've got <65% HP, you don't need it."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,ItsSomethingLikeThat,7,Sun May 31 13:27:58 2015 UTC,"yeah corruption is a tricky wand to balance, and it's pretty clear that I've overtuned it.   I'm working on some balance patches to 0.3.0. Going to be making the mage a bit more satisfying (not much directly stronger though), looking into some of the battlemage effects, and of course looking into wands.   Currently corruption is the primarily candidate for nerfs in the first patch."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,00-Evan,1 point,Sun May 31 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"Similarly, can I ask you a question? Is the battlemage perk for a disintegration staff that you get the grim modifier? Because it seems extremely weak. Perhaps it could apply a damage over time, or something like that."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,Eris_Omnisciens,1 point,Sun May 31 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"Disintegration, like all battlemage effects, may get tweaked. I felt like grim worked pretty decently though. It's like grim but less common, as the wand itself is already fairly powerful."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,00-Evan,1 point,Sun May 31 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"It just feels a lot weaker compared to the other buffs, IMO. Corruption has Amok, and the rainbow-light crystal one (forget what it's called) has blind and some other effect. Grim is already unreliable without a lower chance, and is just win-more, as you do damage to gain charges which are damage, and grim is really just more damage."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,Eris_Omnisciens,1 point,Sun May 31 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"well, it is the wand of disintegration, damage and killing is the main theme.  Wands that are less about direct damage will have stronger effects though, as they need more to compensate for being the main upgrade target. In the case of prismatic light and corruption, both are getting scaled back a bit as well, so their stronger battlemage effects might make more sense then too."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,00-Evan,1 point,Sun May 31 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"Have you considered making the battlemage perk only affect the staff? General recharge seems way too powerful, especially with Chilling, Blast, or Blind attached. I had a level one regrowth wand that just never ran out.  Battlemage OP plz nerf."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,RSquared,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:00:27 2015 UTC,that's actually something I already have in development.
PixelDungeon,37yfid,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"Word.  Love the update, but the BM is super easy mode right now.  He's gonna be tough to balance just because his mechanic is so unique."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,RSquared,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"I've put in a fair few levers for balancing him actually.  For starters the melee he's forced to use is super weak, simply by virtue of that it makes him lean onto wands so much more. Even charge becoming specific is going to seriously affect him as it'll make it so he has to pick a specific wand to rely on, rather than just getting tonnes of charge everywhere."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"What about making the BM's wands recharge at a slower rate than the staff? Like 25% charge/turn for staff (I think that's what it is atm) and 10-15% for wands? Or if that's too OP with many wands, only allow the charge bonus to apply if the wand is in a quickslot?"
PixelDungeon,37yfid,killerkebab,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"actually the battlemage is just straight up losing the charge buff on his other wands, only the staff will gain extra charge from melee. Magic missile is getting tweaked some to give a general recharging buff though, so if you want to be a battlemage with lots of wands that might be your staff of choice."
PixelDungeon,37yfid,00-Evan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"It was super fun, but I can understand it getting nerfed.

PixelDungeon,37yfid,nahlej,2,Sun May 31 14:22:15 2015 UTC,"I'm reposting this comment here as it's more relative to this thread original is found in your release thread:  Ok, I now love the mage class. Best class ever. Well done m8! Synopsis of my first successful new mage run: immediately chose battlemage beat first 5 levels easily using Magic Missile staff all upgrades invested in it. the wand maker quest gave me a wand of corruption Immediately imbued it into my staff to see what it does. Upon melee success it may cause the Amok status, excellent for taking out groups of enemies. When cast it permenantly dominates the enemy if it is strong enough and has enough charges. ( I believe that the more levels it has the less charges it takes to dominate an enemy of certain strength) After testing and figuring out how corruption works I next acquired plate armor and upgraded to level 3 - sufficient to conquer the game. (later blacksmithed it to level 4) I then discovered that the wand of corruption is terribly weak against bosses. Tengu would have killed me if I didn't have the plate armor lvl 3. I beat him in the head with my staff till he died (level 4 or 5 at this time) I rick rolled the caves. Corruption staff is awesome, but you have to be careful as it takes 3-4 charges to dom stronger enemies. DM-300 once again proved that the staff is terrible against bosses. I suggest having a secondary damage weapon you switch to, as I only won the war of healing/attrition by standing still and hitting him with my weak staff as much as I could and popping health potions (I had about 19 when I entered just because I never had to use them to beat levels, and was down to 9 when I won.) Again rickrolled through the dwarf area and could pretty much corrupt just about every encounter since I learned to play it smart and let the dominated enemy do some fighting. Beat the king using toxic potion trick. Used magic maps to scout last 3 levels and torches to get around. Having eyeballs as your friends makes life much easier. fully upgraded staff by now (9) and found a wand of piercing light back in the dwarf area. It was cursed, shot it a couple of times couldn't tell what really happened. Uncursed it and stashed it for a possible imbue if needed for final boss. Made it to the final boss with demon halls fully explored/looted and 15 health pots. Since I LOVED the corruption staff I tried to beat the boss without switching imbues. That was a bad idea, as the hands are immune (I expected at least a temporary effect.) After wasting many HPotions I Imbued the light and and immediately started owning the boss. I did notice that a fully upgraded light staff (lvl10) upon zap does about 25 damage and has a chance to blind. Upon melee strike as a battlemage it has a chance to paralyze which is good. Also I had obtained a scroll of enchantment and had a lucky roll as it gave me Lucky! One of my favorites! However I think the staff might be bugged, as it was hitting twice per hit instead of comparing and applying one damage. So I'd melee, then it would hit for 10 and 15, even before I changed the imbue to light. So I squished the boss, grabbed the key and stepped on the godly maggots. Marched straight to the amulet of Yendor and upon selecting the option to call it a day my game froze.. LOL Still so worth it and the funnest game I've played (out of over 1000 plays idk how much) Thanks! Ahddib"

PixelDungeon,37tl4y,BilbolDev,3,Sat May 30 07:54:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a limitation for AI on android (at least not for any AI that would be used in a roguelike). The only changes that I could see are a better UI for Desktops, more items, more complexity."
PixelDungeon,37tl4y,download_free_ram,2,Sat May 30 10:34:15 2015 UTC,I think what helps PD the most is that one thing is happening at a time. Not all mobs are moving simultaneously making it easier to process. Now had all mobs in level been moving...  I think PD can be the next minesweeper or so. People at work can toy with it.
PixelDungeon,37tl4y,BilbolDev,3,Sat May 30 11:45:30 2015 UTC,"But then there's no reason to buy it for 5$, provided that you have an android phone."
PixelDungeon,37tl4y,download_free_ram,1 point,Sat May 30 12:08:21 2015 UTC,It's hard to play on an android phone while working :P  A desktop app is more plausible for such a scenario :P  I think the price is maybe because steam takes a cut or so so there has to be something
PixelDungeon,37tl4y,BilbolDev,2,Sat May 30 12:42:27 2015 UTC,"Steam takes 30%, which is the same google play takes for microtransactions and paid apps.  I'd say it costs money for two reasons:  Firstly, there is likely pressure from steam for it to be paid or have some form of microtransactions, as steam is more heavily curated, and obviously it's not in valve's interest to host things people can't pay for, as that's how they make money.  Secondly, it's just a reality that charging for content (up front cost or microtransactions) makes a LOT more money than just asking for donations. We see this all over the place, where even donations laced with content (kickstarter, shattered donations, etc.) are more successful than normal donations. Watabou and Arcnor probably want to make money back on the work they've done, and especially in Watabou's case he probably wants to see how viable it is for him to have a career as an independent games designer.   I would say that the game is easily worth $5, desktop is a platform that's more open to up-front cost, and if it helps Watabou turn this into a career we should absolutely support him."

PixelDungeon,37ts6o,Heavy_Lobster,3,Sat May 30 09:21:47 2015 UTC,"So, as you have already seen, the battlemage gets various bonus effects from different wands infused with the staff.  Some of these are basically just extra regular enchantments, and in those cases I'm definitely interested in changing/refining them to be more interesting, and in some cases more balanced.  In the case of prismatic light, as it's a mixed utility wand, using at as a primary weapon carries some risks as it's not always going to hit as hard as a more damage based wand. I gave it a fairly strong effect to compensate, it's the stunning enchantment basically.  Even if that turns out to not be OP (which it may be) it is fairly boring. I'm planning at least one, possibly two balance patches to the wand rework, with the first one focusing more heavily on the mage himself. As Part of that patch i'm going to take a second look at battlemage effects and see if I can make them more interesting."

PixelDungeon,37sj99,-narcoticc,2,Sat May 30 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"Enchant only when you don't plan on upgrading any more. Your other items can help influence this decision.  For example, if I find a ring of haste or a wand of firebolt, I don't mind capping my weapon with an enchantment sooner rather than later, since 90% of future upgrades are going into that other item instead of my weapon anyway.  If you find something that's already enchanted, remember, you can get that item to +2 risk free.  +3 has a 50/50 shot of keeping the enchantment.  Anything beyond that is more risk than it's worth if you're sitting on a good enchantment."
PixelDungeon,37sj99,NCOSRane,1 point,Sat May 30 02:58:01 2015 UTC,"I generally get a decent armor at start, like scale or plate, and upgrade it to where I can wear it. Then I upgrade my weapon to level 8 and the 9th is enchantment. Usually this happens around the Caves Boss, so I spend my scrolls from the dwarf halls on the armor again. Once I get the armor kit I use it and upgrade whatever ring I have, usually the one from the imp. When my armor is upgraded I dump all my styluses into it to get a good glyph. Keep in mind I play shattered, so I might not follow the same schedule a vanilla user would."
PixelDungeon,37s3ht,jengelke,6,Fri May 29 23:01:47 2015 UTC,"the new wand of regrowth shoots a cone that scales with charges used, but it's not 1:1. Obviously it can't shoot half a tile long, so at some point the value gets rounded, which means at certain thresholds the size of the cone won't increase.  That being said, the chance for rare plants to spawn always increases by charges used, so there is a point to still upgrading it, if that's how you want to play."

PixelDungeon,37rbu0,jengelke,2,Fri May 29 19:40:21 2015 UTC,"The starflower is an extremely rare plant. It's easiest to get from regrowth, but at +3 it's still quite unlikely. It's also fairly rare for it to drop a seed when stepped on, so nice luck =).  The seed is very brewable, just think, what potion doesn't currently have a seed associated with it?"
PixelDungeon,37rbu0,00-Evan,2,Fri May 29 19:42:24 2015 UTC,"So, just tested with Blandfruit and it appears to be an Experience potion substitute. Of course, this makes me wonder why anyone would bother gathering 3 seeds to brew a potion with if you actually had spare blandfruit."
PixelDungeon,37rbu0,00-Evan,3,Fri May 29 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"That's one of the points of blandfruit really, to make brewing more worthwhile when you have limited numbers of seeds."
PixelDungeon,37rbu0,00-Evan,2,Fri May 29 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"As a sidenote question, what is the max level of experience that can be gained from kills in Shattered?

PixelDungeon,37rbu0,Russianbull15,3,Fri May 29 21:23:56 2015 UTC,"The max level you can get from enemies in both versions is 26, there are no changes to that in shattered. Bosses can actually give you exp up to 30 in both versions though. Due to adding starflower, I've actually tweaked levels to have a hard cap of 30, any higher and your exp will reset and you'll get a bless buff, but no levelup."

You can even tap the buffs in a mob's info window to see what's affecting them too!

This is because the turn system progresses in non-whole-numbered turns, basically adding half a turn for each attack.  I.E. You defeated a rat with your first hit, meaning the turn counter is at X.5. When you attack the next creature, another half is added, meaning the turn counter is X+1, once again a whole number, once again time for the enemy to attack.  Hope I helped!"

I strongly suspect that it is related to the three crashes at depth 15. The two times I descended to 15, the game crashed. No option for reporting. Loaded just fine, surprisingly at 15. Must have saved right after the descent/generation. Same thing happened during the fight, when I got back in the Purification buff was gone. Probably naturally. Version 0.3.0."
PixelDungeon,37mw9s,00-Evan,6,Thu May 28 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"yeah I can see how a crash might cause this.  The game initializes the time to the maximum value for a number (which is what you see here), and then drops it down to the time value for the earliest-acting actor it can find. In 0.3.0 (fixed in 0.3.0a) There's a bug where the game can crash while trying to find that earliest-acting actor, and if it manages to save in such a case you would get a reported time of.. well.. that.  Make sure you get the latest patch (0.3.0a, there'll be another one tonight so 0.3.0b soon) as I've been running around squishing bugs. As part of 0.3.0b I'll add a safety check so clearly wrong time values like this won't get saved."

PixelDungeon,37n14e,00-Evan,2,Thu May 28 21:12:03 2015 UTC,Fixing succubi to know the difference between solid ground and any old square adjacent to the hero is tough. It might be easier just to set it so the demon hall levels don't have chasm rooms. Or my personal favorite idea: Don't spawn succubi on chasm levels. Replace all succubi with evil eyes. Uh oh! Or even scorpios. Either of those are a pain on chasm levels.  I guess another easy fix is to make succubi fly. Aren't they demons anyway?
PixelDungeon,37n14e,NCOSRane,2,Fri May 29 04:15:33 2015 UTC,"no it's pretty easy to make succubi recognize what's a chasm floor actually, i'll probably add it in 0.3.0c"

The key is to have mind vision and invis potions. Wait until the fists have wandered away (while you're invis) and run up and start whacking on Yog until you are surrounded by larva so the fists can't smash you.

But once I got the class changing book after beating the third boss I beat goo every ~10 tries.   After playing for months and months in my spare time the first levels didn't seem like such a big threat. You just have to discover some good strategies that work for you.  Also, Getting armor from the ghost is the most important thing for early levels imho (although I've been burned before.... hence the flair)"

PixelDungeon,37n4ae,gruessner358,2,Thu May 28 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Level 1: Potions- Test them at the very very end of the stage right before you descend and when there is nothing left (so you don't waste a pot needed for piranhas, burnable door, or trap rooms). You do this for the +1 strength pots since the items spawned on each floor factor in your strength (higher strength = better)  Scrolls-  1. You have an unidentified armor or ring, AND something to upgrade (warrior weap, wiz staff, huntress boomerang): test them whenever you want. You don't want to waste an identify/remove curse scroll. Magic mapping is good enough to wait to the second floor, but I like knowing what I have to determine if the run is mediocre or amazing 2.

PixelDungeon,37n4ae,00-Evan,3,Fri May 29 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry but it's going to happen at some point.  My goal (eventually) for subclasses is to be much more specialization focused. I'm keeping them general right now but eventually there is going to be more choice, and the current state of your run should influence that choice. For example (THIS IS NOT FINAL!) There might be a subclass which lets you use rings & artifacts without equipping them, but that's a much more fun choice to make if you're in the mid-game and already have items that work with that subclass.  I also don't like the idea of vets getting a free pass in the sewers, if they're too cumbersome for those who are chipping away at the lategame, they should be made easier, which is what I'm doing in many ways. Naturally doing this will make the sewers a complete joke if you already have a subclass, another reason to delay the player getting them."
PixelDungeon,37n4ae,gruessner358,1 point,Fri May 29 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure. I've been thinking about it since you posted and it makes lot of sense to wait till later to get the book. I usually spec at the very beginning of a game, and then I find an item suited for the other subclass (most notably warrior and wizard).  I just don't like the idea of waiting till after tengu every time; sometimes I find a great combo and never get a chance to use it. Too bad goo has Lloyd's beacon, otherwise that would be the perfect place to get the book!  But I think you are definitely on the right track with pushing back when the player gets the book.

PixelDungeon,37n4ae,EstherDarkish,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, that would be cool, but make sure everything is ""flavorful"" in some way, like, as an example, when your warlock eats something, instead of ""That food tasted delicious!"", a message should say something like ""Human food tastes like dust to you, only souls can feed your hunger"" (but you'll still have the Recharging buff, so players will understand that food does ""something"")."
PixelDungeon,37n4ae,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"yeah some extra flavour would be nice too.  There are quite a few little rough edges with 0.3.0, largely a result of wanting to get the dev process done with so I can get feedback and move forward. As these little rough spots gets pointed out they'll be fixed, hopefully the wand rework will feel notably more polished after 0.3.0c. I know it sucks to deal with content in a slightly more rough form early on, but it's sort of necessary as the 1-man dev process basically puts me in an echo chamber until I release."

PixelDungeon,37lv8x,people_with_hats,2,Thu May 28 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"You need to complete the quest for that stratum to use the next shop.  The quest guy is a semi-invisible imp who tells you to kill some stuff and bring back their loot.  If you skip the quest, there will be no store on floor 21.  There are four enemies in the dwarf city:   Warlocks - Have a strong ranged attack.  If you see one and it's far away, turn a corner or get behind a door where it can't shoot you and wait for it to come to you. Their ranged attacks can reduce your strength for a while, but their melee attacks can't. Fireballs - Meh enemies.  Can set you on fire, so fight them near or in water.  You already have the scroll holder, so no need to worry about scrolls burning up. Monk - Annoying as ****.  Their attacks have a chance to force you to drop your weapon, making you waste a turn to pick it up and another turn to equip it.  If you can, use your wands to wear them down and then use surprise attacks to kill them.  If that isn't enough, it might be better to just use wands to finish them off instead of pick your weapon back up. Golem - Their attacks hurt a lot.  No matter how much armor you have they're going to be hitting for 20-30 if they can land an attack.  They move at 80% speed or something, so it's possible to outrun them, but you'll have to deal with them eventually.   The next floors are the demon halls, which you'll want to skip, so make sure you're ready for Yoggy when you defeat the boss of those floors."
PixelDungeon,37lv8x,Heavy_Lobster,1 point,Thu May 28 20:42:51 2015 UTC,so are you saying after the dwarf boss skip the rest till 25? ive been getting stuck pretty badly on floors 20+... havent won yet
PixelDungeon,37lv8x,ShadowBannedXexy,2,Fri May 29 01:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, floors 22-24 are the demon halls which have three enemies, one that's ranged which ignores armor, one that's ranged which cripples you so you can't get to it, and one that charms you so you can't attack it.  None of them are easy to fight and they're all everywhere.  Also, the loot isn't all that much better than floors 21-24, so there isn't even much point to them.  If you find any scrolls of magic mapping, save them for the demon halls and just run to the stairs.  Your vision decreases as you go through them, so if you only have one or two MM scrolls, save them for floors 23 and 22.  Floor 23 only gives you vision of adjacent squares, so if you don't have a MM scroll or a MV potion, you're stuck."

PixelDungeon,37lv8x,ShadowBannedXexy,1 point,Fri May 29 11:53:21 2015 UTC,"You're low on healing potions. Buy out the shop on 16. Maybe even go back for any you couldn't afford on 11 or 6 if you didn't buy them already.  Take the next five levels slowly.  Every step counts.  If you touch the wrong spot on your screen, you'll run around in circles on fire while monks and golems and elementals advance on you and warloks blast the crud out of you with ranged attacks.  If you see a warlock and aren't within one square of him, step right back out of the room or around the corner and let him come to you. His ranged attack is pretty potent, lowers strength, and I believe ignores armor. His melee attack is extremely accurate but not horribly damaging with the armor you're wearing.  Identify that glaive, and if it's at least +1 so you can use it, don't sell it. If you have a spare weapon when fighting dwarf monks, you can equip it while fighting instead of trying to pick up your axe when they disarm you. That said, do the door thing with monks. Every hit counts with these guys, because every attack they take could end up stalling you for three turns while you pick up your weapon, equip it again (and possibly get it knocked right back out of your hands). Their attacks aren't incredibly damaging, but you don't want to be fumbling with your weapon for an extended period of time giving a monk free hits while something else walks in on you.  In fact, do the door thing on everybody, constantly. You don't want to stand and trade hits unnecessarily. Since you're a gladiator with an accurate weapon, once you land that first hit, stick around and keep hitting until you miss or the enemy blocks something, then retreat to the next door.  Use your items liberally. You're not going to need that many seeds, potions, and scrolls just for Yog. With the small number of potions you have left, you're going to be skipping the demon hall levels as efficiently as you can instead of clearing them. So treat these dwarf floors like they're a big deal. Every hit you don't take because you smartly used a seed or scroll or potion saves your healing potion supply, which you'll need when you're in a big empty room fighting giant Yog fists and larvae."
PixelDungeon,37lv8x,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 28 21:02:13 2015 UTC,"His ranged attack is pretty potent, lowers strength, and I believe ignores armor.   Yeah, as a ""magic"" attack, it ignores any damage reduction by armor.   You're not going to need that many seeds, potions, and scrolls just for Yog.   I'd say save MV, invis, and maybe toxic and paralytic for Yog.  Earthroot is good if you can bait the fists away.  Everything else can go though."

PixelDungeon,37kbjc,crackadillicus,6,Thu May 28 06:42:36 2015 UTC,"So my intention had always been to give the player more tools to use, and make the opposition harder to compensate. Currently you're seeing a lot of the former with the ring and wand reworks, but not a lot of the latter. By killing, rebalancing, or artifact-ifying a lot of the weak utility items I feel like I've hugely increased the diversity of the game, but with the more consistently good items the difficulty has of course dropped.   While I'm going to continue evaluating the recent changes to make sure the new wands aren't too good, you're likely going to see the game be notably easier with 0.3.0, as a whole class of upgradeable items are more useful.   However, you're probably not going to see this happen again at this level. All my planned 0.3.X updates are going to be difficulty increases, and infact having the game be 'too easy' at the moment isn't too bad as it opens up design space for some cool new difficulty additions. 0.4.0 may make the game a bit easier, and 0.5.0 is going to feature that degrading substitute I've mentioned before, which will make weapons and armour more consistent in a manner that does not benefit the player (no more plate armor in the sewers)."
PixelDungeon,37kbjc,00-Evan,1 point,Thu May 28 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I was out for a while and couldn't get back to this, but I'd like to continue the conversation.  I really like the creativity you're bringing to the game, this post was mostly a knee-jerk reaction to the Mage starting with a 4/4 staff that could be imbued/re-enchanted multiple times + having upgrade scrolls ID'd from the get go:  I see that it's still tough, but I feel there's some distinct decision-making that's eliminated by this move.  The balance in the choice of whether you risk opening a scroll that may or may not consume a precious upgrade, if you have an item that can utilize it at the time, or save it for later and risk having it burn - or the balance in choosing whether to commit to a wand type fearing you won't find better deeper, I believe those were valuable elements that have been removed.  Perhaps hard/easy wasn't the right choice of words.  The elements you've added to the game are fantastic - I love the variety in the Sad Ghost quest for example; the artifacts are excellent; and I found a wand of force (?) that adds a cool new element; also did you add a seeded-plant aspect to the regrowth? - I fear losing the value in agency though.  What I mean is, if I can limitlessly dump upgrades into my staff, and imbue it with whatever next wand arrives that works for me, then there are games where odds are way higher or lower that I win, just by their own seeding.  However, if I'm put to make decisions, balancing risks and rewards, I have more agency in the game, more value in a win, and more to learn from a loss: elements like these are what make roguelikes such a compelling genre, and I would hate to see all the potential you've introduced lose value as agency is removed."
PixelDungeon,37kbjc,valgrid,2,Tue Jun 2 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"You can mention nicks by /u/nick. Also two versions are hard to maintain, a hard mode would make more sense."
PixelDungeon,37kbjc,BilbolDev,2,Thu May 28 10:12:26 2015 UTC,"As with my own version, I think what makes them easy (if they are easy) is because the monsters stats were based on gear/rings/wands. Evan added artifacts and other stuff that make it easier  Monster stats need to be reworked in all versions that add new items to maintain the same difficulty of the original."

Maybe it's easy for other classes, as I have only played mage from the update till now (Fav class), but mages is really balanced, IMO"
PixelDungeon,37kbjc,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 28 14:52:24 2015 UTC,"The mage update was actually pretty minor and was in many ways a nerf. Your wand of missiles can now transfer more than one upgrade to another wand by becoming that wand instead of disenchanting itself. That's really it. You actually lose some upgrade potential if both the wand you're using and your staff are upgraded, because you take the highest level while sacrificing the upgrades you made to the other.  On top of that, warlocks can't feed themselves any more (you starve eternally end-game when you're max level?) and battlemages don't recover a charge per hit or do extra melee damage, instead getting this silly charge generation buff for one turn. Those are nerfs, not enhancements.  But the new wands themselves (save for OP firebolt) are all better. So put them in the hands of a freerunner instead of a mage, and the game's easier."
PixelDungeon,37kbjc,00-Evan,2,Thu May 28 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"Warlocks gain significantly more fullness and health from killing enemies than before. While you don't get to eat regular food and hunger will be a problem, you should get more significant benefits from killing enemies to compensate. While you can eventually starve if you're max level, the same is true for running out of food, and the rates are balanced to be similar.  The battlemage no longer does excess damage or gets a charge upfront but instead gets bonus effects based on what wand is imbued in his staff and 50% charge for all his wands over time. In the case of magic missile, the effect allows you to get lots of extra charge, but it varies by wand and allows for lots of interesting combo effects with stuff like the weightstone and regular enchantments.  You do have a point regarding the staff no longer being a free upgrade transfer, but part of that is balancing, I wanted the mage to have more wand versatility but I don't want to just give him a way to combine all the upgrades if all the wands he's run across. If this ends up being too harsh I could make it a bit more lenient and let a few extra upgrades transfer over, but I'm still evaluating that.  Also, yes, wands should work pretty well with the freerunner. It is intended that wands become more generally useful, especially to ranged classes, but the mage should still be the best with them. Again, this is something I can address through numbers tweaks if it turns out to be a problem, but I'm still evaluating that."
PixelDungeon,37kbjc,Oglop,1 point,Thu May 28 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"Wands are definitely more useful, especially the venom wand. I just won a game with a staff imbued with the light wand, and having a secondary venom wand in my inventory. Light wand is pretty awesome because it blinds, making ranged attackers run to you instead of shooting from afar. Saved my ass a few times.  The new venom wand applies a 3-block radius poison cloud on whichever tile it hits that does increasing damage over time (found it as +1 and never upgraded it, and it was still VERY powerful).   Found tengu, dwarf king, and you dewza to be the easiest bosses in my run. Tengu and dwarf were blinded the entire time by my light wand, so I never took a single point of damage from them. Killed the fists in yog's lair first by paralyzing them in a venom wand cloud, then blinding them with my light wand. Yog fell without spawning a single larva because apparently wands don't trigger their spawn.  This was actually my first run of the new version, so I didn't even have the class book from the beginning, had to get it from tengu when I beat him."
PixelDungeon,37kbjc,00-Evan,1 point,Thu May 28 18:00:31 2015 UTC,"That's an example of a pretty strong combo, but I do have some concerns about the wand of venom. I may adjust it in the future."
PixelDungeon,37ii05,Aerologist,5,Wed May 27 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"As far as end game scaling your best bets are Gladiator and Assassin, combos and the crits are just great all game long. If you are having trouble mostly with getting your games going (getting up to and beating tengu) I would suggest the Warlock and the Berserker. With some armour the Warden is essentially invincible which is nice, free runner and sniper are probably the hardest to play, freerunner end game often turns out to be similar to a vanilla rogue... and sniper can be hit and miss depending on your utility items.  Personal favourite is the warlock. I use him for most of the challenges and such that I try. Much higher early game survivability.  Don't know about shattered, too easy for my liking. I got into PD because it was brutal but rewarding, shattered seems to be interesting, but reminds me of the darks ages in PD before degradation when win rates were stupidly high. I beat shattered on my third attempt (after suiciding with a chalice because I'm a derp and then because the dew vial didn't go off which I didn't know about...)"
PixelDungeon,37ii05,SGAdventures,2,Wed May 27 22:27:29 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that shattered is easier than PD classic, but that doesn't mean that classic is hard. Many of the overpowered items don't get nerfed in classic (e.g. bombs stunning bosses and dealing ridiculous amounts of damage) and degradation is more of an inconvenience than nerf. Wand of regrowth is still fantastic at +0 with 4 patches of grass made in corridors and you can grind hp pots on floor 11 if you save up 2-3 upgrade scrolls.  Tl;dr: both are easy once you know what to exploit :P  PS: Warlock is sooooo much fun to play. +1 for you.  Edit: PPS: Watched your vid on youtube a while back SGAdventures. You did some great subtle things on the warden run that made it easier for me when I revisited the class."
PixelDungeon,37ii05,gruessner358,2,Thu May 28 04:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah the game got a lot easier a few patches ago with the honey pot and the bomb, I do like the shattered versions of the honey pot and the dew vial.

PixelDungeon,37ii05,friendlyfire,1 point,Thu May 28 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Floor 11 has the highest spawn chance for bats, and bats have a 1/8 chance to drop HP pots. You can get those drops till hero level 16, and you stop getting exp from bats and gnolls after lvl 15  So you can essentially stay there indefinitely as long as #hp pots used < number of hp pots dropped.   (This also applies to the flies on floor 7 and warlocks on 16, but it's easier on 11 imho.)"

PixelDungeon,37ii05,friendlyfire,3,Fri May 29 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"Berserker/assasin are honestly the best classes imho.     Berserker starts out extremely strong on the early floors while still powering through endgame effectively. That one extra strength lets you wear top tier armor in the first 5 levels which increases my success on goo tremendously.  Assassin on the other hand is harder to get going in the beginning than berserker, but the rogue evasion helps tremendously in the later part of the game (if your strength is higher than the required amount for your armor, you get a boost in evasion)  Battlemage is too situational relying heavily on wands (since the basic one is near useless endgame), and gladdy relies heavily on accurate fast weapons to be effective (even though an 8 hit combo will kill anything). I'm not saying they're bad, but I have a hard time getting a 50% win rate on them.  As for shattered, I honestly like it better now than vanilla (even before the degradation patch - the reason I switched). The devs put in a great deal of effort to make the game great and I think they are doing a fantastic job balancing items and keeping the game fresh on each playthrough! I suggest trying out the mod now that there were a significant number of changes. I doesn't compromise your PD stats and if you don't like it you can always go back! If you do try it, make sure to past back and share your thoughts! :D"

PixelDungeon,37ii05,NCOSRane,2,Thu May 28 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"Assassin is hands-down the best.  After that, it's a toss up depending on your playing style. Sniper is my favorite class. I like battlemages. I like berserkers.  A lot of people tend to prefer warlocks, gladiators, and freerunners. Nobody likes huntress classes except for me, and most feel that the battlemage is too situational (e.g., must find firebolt/disintegration or you lose), but you can get pretty creative with some of those other wands."

PixelDungeon,37dinn,dachhack,2,Wed May 27 01:57:14 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see what the update will do to my current huntress run which has both a wand of flock and a wand of avalanche.   EDIT: Jumped back into my saved game and turned both of those wands into magic missile. Currently on the 15 lvl and the game crashed when I threw a javlin at a gnoll brute. Also I could not auto target with either wand I was using for that run before the crash. Another thing I noticed is that I lost my Tomb of Mastery for the Mage after this update.
PixelDungeon,37dinn,tso,2,Wed May 27 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"hmm, the mage tome of master bit is very odd, as I made no changes to that logic.  turning those wands in magic missile is correct, as there is no real equivalent to them after the changes.  If your game crashed then please send me a bug report from the crash popup, they are extremely helpful in solving those issues."

PixelDungeon,37dinn,PlaySalieri,2,Wed May 27 06:46:33 2015 UTC,"Edit: After playing for an hour or so, I have the following feedback to add.  Wand of destruction no longer has like a 5 square range... My eternal gratitude for that, and it seems now that a lot of the corners that formerly blocked LOS don't seem to(at least for destruction).  Wand of regrowth is kinda odd now, sometimes uses all charges, and instead of impacting and spreading, it seems to be conical, and has a chance to spawn a plant that spews a few seeds when running over it.  Changes to wands in general are awesome, as well as mage tweaks (currently just got skill book, and went battle mage) Thanks for the update and continuously great game!"
PixelDungeon,37dinn,jyjjy,2,Wed May 27 07:53:48 2015 UTC,"I love the new sprites and icon. Ethereal Chains sound like a great interesting addition.  With the increased seed rate, the toolkit is more relevant. I'm looking forward to how you will revamp that artifact."

PixelDungeon,37dinn,Scharnvirk,1 point,Wed May 27 05:20:45 2015 UTC,I think auto-iding identify was more useful since upgrade is really common and you can figure it out by level 3. All the other scrolls are much more difficult to identify.
PixelDungeon,37dinn,Scharnvirk,3,Wed May 27 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"it's not about being more useful, I felt like upgrade thematically fits better with the mage, and it encourages spending the scrolls early to buff up his magic staff, which is important part of his new gameplay."
PixelDungeon,37dinn,zeruel01,1 point,Wed May 27 19:42:18 2015 UTC,How do you feel about mages being able to tell when an item is cursed without equiping? Perhaps they get bonus effects from some scrolls or wands that other classes do not? They are magicians with ancient arcane knowledge. The staff is nice but it seems they should get more general advantages when working with magic scrolls and wands and curses.
PixelDungeon,37dinn,Poiuy2010_2011,1 point,Thu May 28 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like working with curses is more of a separate theme, evil vs good magic instead of just the arcane. I may have a class idea that works on that theme, but adding more classes is a little ways off yet.  As for the bonus effects from wands, let me know what you think of the effects the battlemage gets from combat with different imbued staffs."

PixelDungeon,37dinn,ahddib,1 point,Thu May 28 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"That shouldn't be the case, the only none-wand option I removed was the mage's starting knuckleduster, you're still free to find and invest in a melee weapon."

PixelDungeon,37dinn,kanser42,1 point,Thu May 28 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"Ice is a mix of damage and utility, the intention is that you use it in conjunction with other items to take advantage of the slow effect it provides. Its damage is quite strong to start but it gets very big penalties if you're shooting at an already chilled target. Wand of Frost makes sense as a main wand if you want to upgrade it alongside another weapon which you'll use as your main damage dealer."
PixelDungeon,37dinn,kanser42,2,Thu May 28 17:31:42 2015 UTC,Ack. Then I shouldn't have imbued it into my staff.   Staff of Corruption is so good though. Only had the boss fights to worry about.
PixelDungeon,37dinn,kanser42,1 point,Fri May 29 05:33:30 2015 UTC,"corruption is one people are consistently saying is great, it may have a nerf incoming."
PixelDungeon,37dinn,eontriplex,1 point,Fri May 29 05:43:06 2015 UTC,"I do think corruption needs a nerf. Just did a playthrough with it and almost never had to worry. Bosses, yea, a lil bit. But by then you've saved up so many health potions that you don't have to worry (since using a +10 staff of corruption as a battlemage provides access to infinite corruptions, thus meaning there is literally no need to actually fight anything that isn't a boss). Actually, even ol' Dwarf King is a breeze cuza the adds. Perhaps corruption should end when you hit a corrupted target, at least? So you can't just hit things until they die while they just look for other enemies like ""Lol, kay"".   Moving on though, update is kinda amazing. Mages always disappointed me until now. Now mages actually exist. The new staff mechanics are exactly what this game needed to make mages my favourite class (as they should be to a magic lover). Thank you, Evan. You sir are amazing. Keep it up."
PixelDungeon,37dinn,DerTanni,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"=) glad you like the update!  The biggest problem with corruption is that it is supposed to be notably harder to corrupt full health targets (I've internally nicknamed it the wand of pokemon as the mechanic is very similar to a pokeball). Currently, due to bad tuning, that isn't the case. When corruption gets balanced in the upcoming patch you're going to need to engage with your pre-corruption victims much more, or risk running out of charges very quickly."
PixelDungeon,37g60v,OldManBilly,1 point,Wed May 27 11:42:31 2015 UTC,"In PD, health is affected by hunger only when you are starving. You don't regenerate health and you lose one HP after a number of turns while starving.  In Minecraft, hunger is not affected by health. The opposite is the case. Regen stops there too, but way quicker (4 lost hunger points) than in PD. When the hunger bar is down to zero, you start loosing health too, but quickly. And you need to play with HARD difficulty to die of starvation.  So yes, it's very similar to Minecraft, but in PD it's waaay softer and easier to handle. I guess you just messed up while writing that title."
PixelDungeon,37g60v,trulte42,2,Wed May 27 11:58:02 2015 UTC,"What I meant was, do you gain hunger faster when you are not at full health? In minecraft, regenerating health consumes your hunger much faster. Is it the same for PD?"
PixelDungeon,37g60v,trulte42,1 point,Wed May 27 12:36:28 2015 UTC,"No, that is, as far as I know, not the case for PD. I think sleeping slows hunger though.  But I still think -- whoops, checked the wiki and it seems you are right about how it is in Minecraft. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. Started playing 1.2.5, so I didn't notice the change at all after 1.6. Interesting."

PixelDungeon,37709k,OldManBilly,2,Mon May 25 11:51:40 2015 UTC,"If you have charges it depends on a couple things. 1) if a crab were to come around that corner RIGHT NOW could you take him? 2) would saving those charges and whacking his face cost more of a difference in health loss that you could not Regen it quickly without feeling it significantly.   In general charges + health + food are your 3 most important resources, always eat when your low, usually starve yourself when you're healthy, and save charges when you can risk it. Never let yourself be caught off guard because you decided to dump your charges into that gnoll who looked at you funny.   Getting good armor early is a huge plus but don't waste your limited number of scrolls on a short term thing like mail or leather armor, it's only really worth it on scale and plate armor and your wand should really take your upgrade priority (killing them before they can touch you vs. Reducing damage when they do)   Your first upgrade should go into your Magic Missile every time, but only 1, After that you're going to want to put upgrades into a long term weapon (Firebolt the most powerful I  game)"
PixelDungeon,37709k,BadB0ii,1 point,Mon May 25 13:19:54 2015 UTC,"Firebolt is insanely strong. Its damage scales with the square of the enchantment (in layman's terms, it does very big damage if you upgrade it). Disintegration also scales similarly, but deals slightly less damage. If you can find early firebolt or disintegration then put almost all your scrolls into that (and a few into armor)."
PixelDungeon,37709k,hpp3,1 point,Mon May 25 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"If your wand is full, spend a charge zapping something. Otherwise, you're not taking advantage of your enhanced charge regeneration rate. Beyond that, it really depends what you're fighting, your equipment, how much health you have left, how much health the enemy has left, etc. Example: An enraged gnoll brute with a tiny sliver of health left? Not worth the risk of damage. Zap him with the wand. A vampire bat that's dodging your attacks easily and you want to kill it before it gets healthy back? Zap with the wand. Unless you have an accurate weapon, then use that if you're low on charges. Use the wand if not. --you see how it can get kind of situational. Better to develop your own feel for when you need a wand to keep things going versus toughing it out. Always if battlemage. Generally not in any other case. The one exception would be if you find an early firebolt/disintegration wand and put a bunch of upgrades into it, and don't find any other decent weapons in those early levels so the upgraded wand turns out to be your most powerful melee weapon. I guess another exception might be to equip your best wand when you see a thief coming so he can't steal it. Never waste upgrades on armor that's not scale or plate. If you find an early suit of plate armor and no good wands, don't sit on those scrolls. Go ahead and use them on the armor. If you find a firebolt wand, ever, spend at least the next 7 upgrades on it. Not on anything else. After you've gotten it to +7, the only things you should ever upgrade again are plate armor, a ring of magic if you find one, and that wand. If you don't have plate armor or a ring of magic, just keep putting every upgrade into the wand as soon as you find the scroll. If you find a ring of magic, upgrade that instead of the wand. If you find plate armor, I""d still alternate upgrades with the wand."
PixelDungeon,37709k,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon May 25 17:15:57 2015 UTC,most useful stuff covered already by other answers. Just be wary with the fire wand. You want a good-ish weapon as well. Putting an upgrade into a weapon won't hurt in the long run. Especially if you hit a fireball enemy on depth 14...  if all you have is a wand of fireblot you will die so fast it's depressing.  (_)
PixelDungeon,37709k,SGAdventures,1 point,Mon May 25 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"Do you have the Tome of Mastery yet? I usually play Battlemage and I love it. You use your wand as your melee weapon and when you get a successful hit, you get a charge back in the equipped wand. Without looking into it, I believe your melee damage is also boosted based on the amount of charges. This gives you a really good system to work with AND removes one of your main worries without Battlemage, the melee weapon.  So to answer question #1, if you're a Battlemage and your wand is low, hit them. Or alternate between melee and wand zaps. If you're not, it really depends on your melee weapon and wand. Knuckledusters are decent because you get two hits in on most enemies.  2) if you're a Battlemage. I don't know of another reason  3) armor will keep you alive hopefully, though mail armor is a little low. Decent to wear but I wouldn't dump a scroll probably, unless really needed. Plate armor, definitely dump the scroll into it.  4) your first upgrade scroll can go to your wand of magic missile, and then you can disenchant it into another wand. If you had the wand of fire bolt before your upgrade scroll, you could just upgrade that directly instead. If you find a wand of firebolt, dump all your scrolls there.. For the most part, unless you get some good rings, like Magic, Haste, maybe Evasion.  EDIT: p.s.: I recently won with mage :D  http://reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/379el2/yes_battlemage_win_shattered_pd/  Double edit: with the wand of firebolt, be careful of grass. If you're standing on grass and shoot, you're going to catch on fire. Fire will also spread from grass to doors. And make sure not to hit the wall next to you (with any offensive wand that's true though)."

PixelDungeon,376etf,trulte42,1 point,Mon May 25 06:56:26 2015 UTC,Works relatively fine when I punch them with the wand. Should be better than a non-upgraded side weapon in most cases.
PixelDungeon,376etf,BadB0ii,1 point,Mon May 25 08:32:34 2015 UTC,Honestly if I get an early Firebolt in a battle mage run then it's pretty much gg. But those damn fire elemental totally fuck me over. I usually kite them through doorways with a side melee weapon/ melee wand. Other than that they're just a natural counter to the battlemage. (a strong backup wand of avalanche is very effective too)

PixelDungeon,371232,Auxermen,3,Sat May 23 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"Hey there, good questions all. I'm currently uploading vids to try and address a tonne of questions like these, so if you're keen check them out on youtube and let me know what you think ('Small Game Adventures', search for Pixel dungeon :)   Yes there are 26 depth in the game and max level cap is 26 from experience, pretty simple math there. Because you're using the warrior hunger isn't so much of a problem for you, only eat food when you are starving and below half hp. Unless you are rushing (never a good idea) always explore every inch of every depth and make sure you are the level of the next depth before descending (with the exeption for the level after each boss, there's leeway in there) This one is hard and kind of game specific. you can easily get through the first 9 depths without any special armour at all. Tengu is fine with a couple of hp pots. From 11 onwards though you need to start having a couple of upgrades in there. You should have fully upgraded armour by the time you hit the dwarven king. (after using the armour kit he drops you can then ignore armour and focus completely on weapons and rings).  So I'd say from about depth 11 onwards you need to start putting a couple of upgrade scrolls into armour, as a gladiator your main focus is your weapon though. Obviously a glaive or warhammer in the early depths and you're set. 16 str weapons are also perfectly good (long sword and axe) anything lower I wouldn't bother wasting scrolls. The alternative for the Gladiator of course is the Knuckledusters. Because of his combo perk these babies are deadly. Even with completely un upgraded knuckledusters you can end up hitting 15+ damage on a good combo. And due to their fast attack speed you can afford to miss every now and then and still maintain your combo. Weighted for accuracy these guys can be awesome! Worth a try one day. Depends how you're going. Remember you can always come back to the shop. I'd say always go for the packs (seed pouch, scroll bag and wand holster) although the wand one isn't always useful. Then if I'm low on hp pots I get those or if I have cursed things I grab the scroll of remove curse (there's always one of those along with identify and mapping). But ALWAYS the bags and you don't want to leave a health pot behind if you can help it. The potion drop rate from a fly is something like (1/generation*5) so attacking them with a -1 knuckledusters or something is great but after a while the likelihood of a potion drop is very very small. (1/15 after third gen, 1/20 after froth etc.) As a general rule, farm any flies you come across as best you can. But I wouldn't be sitting around for ages trying to get more potions. Unless you have a single potion left, the difference between 21 potions and 30 potions is ironically not that great. If you're using that many potions then you have bigger problems and need better equipment. Yes, but only early on or if you've been saving. Early on if you find a high tier weapon or armour that you can't use yet, sure, dump upgrades into them. (preferably all at once rather than one at a time so that you don't find something better having wasted a couple) Later on in the game you should save them for avoiding degradation. Unless, like you say, you're saving some for like plate mail, if you have like 6 upgrade scrolls and find plate mail go ahead and dump 4 into it, 5th one when it is about to degrade and the 6th use on a weapon. +5 Plate will get you through to Yogi fine.   Hope that was useful.  mootle"

PixelDungeon,371232,idkfa_CZ,1 point,Sun May 24 08:14:43 2015 UTC,Good post. My ten cents - even mace and normal swords at about +7 can cut through anything. Mace is still my favorite weapon in game!

PixelDungeon,371232,Scharnvirk,1 point,Mon May 25 03:58:20 2015 UTC,"1: Yes, but in first three levels, unless you know the game enough to know better. Later it doesn't really matter.  2: At that point when you find an armor which is going to get you through entire game, which is either Scale or Plate armor. It MIGHT be worth to use one upgrade scroll on leather or mail armor, though with degradation added in... not sure.   3: Any tier 4 or tier 5, or knuckledusters (but that's a significantly weaker, though still viable option).  4: Storage items -> Healing potions -> weightstone in normal PD or ankh in Shattered -> random scrolls and potions.  5: You don't need to farm, those flies you encounter during normal play are enough. Just ensure they can split after each hit, back off each attack if necessary. If you're running out of healing potions faster than you can get them, it doesn't really matter how many you have. Better not to use too many than to try to have too many.  6: Unfortunately no, you have to save them for the last dungeon stage when the steady supply of Upgrade Scrolls ends. I've had two runs when my armor and weapon each lost 2 levels due to degradation, because you get just one or zero upgrade scrolls in the last stage. Generally speaking, anything that resets that god-awful degradation bar should be used at the very last possible moment. Remember that enchant scrolls and weightstones also reset it!"
PixelDungeon,371232,Natinals,1 point,Sun May 24 14:43:18 2015 UTC,"Updated with more questions, thanks everyone for helping!"
PixelDungeon,371232,bakgwailo,1 point,Sun May 24 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"1) Play when you're able to play. More mobs at night means more exp to gain. Though I seem to recall shattered removed the day/night function for a consistent mob rate?  2) Some rings and wands are great. If you get an already upgraded wand of firebolt or regrowth, there's no harm in throwing one or two scrolls into it. Rings of evasion and power may be worth investing upgrades into. It really depends on what your other gear is for each run.  3) I don't know, I play with degradation off.  4) Some say before entering the next level as its safest. Try and figure out which potion is healing, and not using them before a shop, so you can buy unidentified health potions for cheap.  5) It took me 112 games to win once. After that, it really depends. I think its easier to judge if you can make it the whole way after Tengu, as you can still find some good gear on floors 6-9. Maybe a 1/10-20 win rate after passing Tengu. If I'm confident about my gear after Goo or Tengu, it's more like 1/5 and comes down to playing smart.  Hope this helped."
PixelDungeon,371232,Natinals,1 point,Sun May 24 16:59:38 2015 UTC,Wait... how do you turn degradation off??
PixelDungeon,371232,bakgwailo,2,Sun May 24 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"My bad, didn't realize OP said vanilla. Ive played shattered exclusively for the past year~ since degradation was a thing, and that you can toggle it."
PixelDungeon,371232,SGAdventures,2,Sun May 24 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, NP - actually just discovered shattered (as I figured maybe it was it that from your comment), and oh man it's like when I first discovered pixel dungeon oh so long ago."
PixelDungeon,371232,NCOSRane,1 point,Sun May 24 22:18:24 2015 UTC,"EDIT:    Night time increases the monster spawn rate, the only time this is really useful is if you are desperately trying to farm something (food, potions, scrolls etc.). But it just makes it quicker not easier. The only time I'd suggest using night-time mode is at the start of your runs. You'll die a bunch but it essentially forces you to have a decent item build by the time you get to goo. (stops you forcing a bad hero through to late game and wasting your time). Otherwise, try it as just a challenge ;) Definitely! Depends on which ones though. Ring of evasion or Haste always upgrade! No matter what the hero. Ring of accuracy can be really powerful especially on a Glad (higher chance of getting combos). Moooost other rings I wouldn't bother with (unless you find a cool synergy somewhere). Wands are different. With the Glad I wouldn't bother with attack type wands, but some utility wands are really powerful regardless of the class. Namely Amok. But you only really need 4 charges or so in these wands. The only exception is the wand of regrowth. With regrowth I wouldn't bother if you're feeling good, but if you're struggling and desperate then having a +4 or +5 wand will essentially allow you to have a full dew vial most of the time which is great, also the seeds give you more options and you can make potions. It's a laborious process but sometimes worth it if you don't mind spending the time. Which depth are you on? Assuming you don't have a weight stone for the weapon or an enchantment scroll. If you are before about depth 13 then the weapon, past that probably armour. The reason being that you can beat the game with a +4 axe no stress, but if you can't take a hit you're going to waste your hp potions real fast. If you had a ring of evasion or haste though I'd go weapon. The best possible time would be once you have cleared a depth, standing on a patch of water near a door and the stairs down, having just leveld up to the next level, hungry and on half health. Identify scrolls first (may get challenge so not many enemies left, or identify to use on a potion) if you get mind vision potion walk down the depth to see what's around, fire: wait a turn on the water, toxic gas: walk through door and wait till gone, Paralysis: won't last as long if you are hungry, health: you are on half so no massive loss, experience: you just went up a level so haven't wasted any xp. (don't identify a potion if you are levitating...) It depends on your play style and hero choices. Assuming a normal run (no challenges, game or self induced) with the tome of mastery activated...  Personally I tend to average 1 in 4. 1 in about 4.5 right from the beginning. This is also assuming I am 'forcing' the game (playing carefully and trying not to die) rather than rushing (take everything to the face and go through lots of false starts to get the item or build you want). Half the deaths to random bad luck, half to inefficient item drops and the third half to just being an idiot...   mootle"
PixelDungeon,36zu1p,LucioX580,3,Sat May 23 15:23:42 2015 UTC,There is a reason why pretty much EVERY PD mod either removes degradation or gives the option to turn it off. It's a poorly thought out mechanic that only adds an unfair difficulty level onto the game.
PixelDungeon,36zu1p,Omen267901,1 point,Tue May 26 02:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's such a pisser, too.  Problem: ""People are just dumping nearly every upgrade scroll onto a single high-caliber item and winning fairly easily.""  'Solution': ""Make all upgraded items degrade as they're used.""  Whoops. You just plain can't survive against enemies beyond depth 15 with crap gear but nobody tweaked the monsters, the base stats of non-upgraded items, the hero's stats, the number of available upgrade scrolls, or anything else in the entire game and just slapped this degrading thing in without a single other modification to balance it? No biggie. Let's add a 'tempered' enchantment to take the place of a real enchantment and make that one particular weapon degrade slower. And let's make items reset their degrade meters when upgraded, so that people save and slowly use upgrade scrolls to feed key items instead of using them to actually upgrade items and are forced to spread their scrolls among multiple items if they want to keep them."
PixelDungeon,36zu1p,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue May 26 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"Item degradation makes all classes   Both classes have their merits.  Warrior should be the easier option for the first win. This is because huntress has to throw 2-4(or more) times more to do the same amount of damage as a melee attack. This means the boomerang degrades faster.  I really like the huntress class, but degration hurts alot. And I find that my huntress runs tend to become a melee run in the end.  I feel the best way to win is to choose either warrior or rogue. Always set aside 1-2 repair items after Goo. The repair items are: Scroll of upgrade, Scroll of enchantment, weightstone. Try to save extra scroll of upgrades for late game gear. Spend more time farming flies than you normally would. Even when you obtain better gear, try to fully use the current gear before switching.  Huntress with eldricht boomerang and wand of blink is actually insane, but I would still think she needs a tier 5 weapon +4 for the end game."

With the huntress once you have those masteries she completely splits. The warden is a complete tank, you give her armour and a weapon and fight like a man. Put maybe 1 or two upgrades into the boomerang but ignore it once you have a decent weapon.   The sniper however...   That is who you want a good boomerang with. Once you're at Tengu though your boomerang should be at least level 4 if not higher (ideally)  combined with the wand of amok, blink or Lloyds beacon she does all kinds of work!  Don't forget you can use a boomerang without breaking out of invisibility.  mootle"

PixelDungeon,36r0i1,dachhack,3,Thu May 21 13:01:07 2015 UTC,"Now I have 7 games on my phone, and 6 are Pixel Dungeon mods.  I guess you're interested in feedback, right? I just played mod to floor 6 with warrior and not quite sure if I enjoyed it. Dungeons are so huge, took 13 minutes to fully explore and loot 1st floor, and another 53 minutes to get to 5th and kill Goo (yeah, I timed it). And at the same time I had a full backpack of foods and healing items of all sorts, so it was really, really hard to kill me. I was pretty tired of bashing and killing stuff, but maybe other classes will feel more tense and dynamic.  (There also were some typos, but I'm not the one to judge, English is not my native). On the other hand, a new dew vial seems interesting (yet still unbalanced), I'm going to garden the hell out of this dungeon! Special event with rats was fun, and I liked new Goo battle.   So, couple suggestions so far: You sure dungeons should be so huge? Maybe add more floors? If not, maybe generate more empty/decorated rooms to make corridors shorter?  How about upgradable dew vial capacity? Like, acquiring two vials gives you one dew vial 0/20.  Anyways, thank you for making this mod! I'll write more as I explore."

PixelDungeon,36r0i1,NCOSRane,1 point,Sun May 24 19:54:36 2015 UTC,Hey dude i think youre going the path that Dungeon Crawl stone Soup did right?
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,NCOSRane,3,Wed Jun 3 09:19:30 2015 UTC,"So time #2 through this bad boy. I really didn’t find any major bugs. A few times, the game got unresponsive to my touching the screen to walk, so I backed out and re-entered my game and it worked fine. Most of my thoughts relate to balance and content as a result.   Since the last two bosses were upgraded, I figured I’d go through as an assassin again, just to maximize my odds of actually making it to the new guys. Once you know what’s coming, the game’s not as tough as it was your first time through. Balance-wise, I was pretty much able to brute force my way through nearly everything. Why? Wraiths. I ended up with a +24 vampiric knuckleduster. Once I ended up with a vampiric enchantment, I quit using magical infusion scrolls on it (and started using them on my armor instead), but dumped every single upgrade scroll in the game, including the extra ones from wraith rooms, on that baby. Even as a tier-one weapon, I’m doing 70-ish with a surprise attack (because you need -14 strength to use it.  I have 19. That’s a lot of bonus damage.)  Other than a slow start, the game was smooth sailing. The shops still need more. I was able to buy absolutely everything at every shop and still have thousands of gold leftover.  At the end of the game, I have an extra 13k.  I think the game might need more levels. Bigger floors means more loot, so you get into situations where you’re at depth 16 and have enough magic mapping scrolls from drops/loot and buying out every shop to just use one on every single floor for the rest of the game, which makes the talisman a mostly useless artifact. Maybe getting back out with the amulet should be a requirement rather than an option, and the floors going out could be changed (and more difficult).  Or just stick in a few more sets of five. With firebolt shooting dragons everywhere or something.  The hunger/starvation mechanic might honestly be kind of outdated for this mod. I’ve got 82 chargrilled steaks left over and was never once in danger of running out of food. Food might as well be done away with, or just reduced in quantity and turned into special items, i.e., monsters might still drop meat, and you could do all kinds of things to it to turn it into something else, but that something else could be healing or a buff instead of just food to stop starving.   Every boss fight, even though I probably didn’t need it, I popped a toasted nut and a dungeon berry. Why not? I have 30 of each to spare by the end of the game. That endless supply of barkskin from nuts probably makes the Warden’s perk less useful. And the only thing I ever used sungrass seeds for was blandfruit, not that I needed the food or the healing. Dungeon berries completely replace sungrass seeds and then some. I have 44 healing and 73 mending potions left (I must’ve gotten thirty mending potions just from demon goo and porked up on healing potions from evil eyes -- thanks for upping the torch amount.) Plus six blessed ankhs and a full dew vial.  I didn’t need my dew vial or a single healing item for Yog. I just popped a nut and a berry before the fight. That plus a vampiric weapon was more than enough to be at full health for pretty much the entire time. The hands were easy – nothing upgraded but their hp. Every hit on the eyeball counts as a surprise attack, so he was easy. I just killed the larva in between hits. When he was almost dead, he teleported across the room and spawned an evil eye. The evil eye was as easy as any of the others. Then back to hitting the eyeball. Yog needs more. A fire-breathing mouth, regrowing dead hands, big tentacles, multiple eyes, eyes that shoot laser beams, whatever.  The dwarf king was a little annoying. I eventually used my dew vial on him, not for healing but for haste, so I could run to his summoning platforms faster than he could. The things he summoned weren’t a problem. It was that he kept running away from me to summon things and regenerating, so I needed haste to keep ahead of him and keep pummeling him. I went invis and threw bombs at the liches/tombstone just for fun, but that didn’t seem to be the secret easy way to win this one, so I just brute-forced the fight – a massively upgraded vampiric weapon with two attacks is pretty overpowered. Every hit on the tombstone counted as a surprise attack and the healing from the vampiric attacks plus my dungeon berry kept up with the liches’ damage pretty well.  The DM fight is the epic one. It wasn’t so bad since I knew exactly what to do this time around. Killing the printers wasn’t hard, though I ate some damage and had to down a potion or two due to all of the laser beams. The fun epic part was sneaking around and catching those robots one or two at a time before taking out the DM itself.  Tengu was probably the hardest fight. When you meet him, you’re not heavily armored yet. He does good damage and gets you in a position where you can’t damage him. He’s taking 4 attacks a round (since you’re slowed most of the battle). As soon as you’re next to him, he’s somewhere else taking 4 attacks a round. Your ranged options are limited that early in the game. If you go invis, he just starts randomly teleporting and filling the room up with traps. He’s got an answer to most of your tricks  Badges – add some epic ones. You’re going to eat 40 pieces food in the first few floors. You’re going to have 7500 gold and 250 kills easily. With a few exceptions, most of the badges are things you’ll end up doing inherently, just by playing, if you make it more than a few floors in."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,Yokoya,2,Fri May 22 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"I do have ideas for after Yog play including releasing some enhanced mobs into the dungeon. Some thing around the lines of regrowing the entire dungeon and undoing all the damage done by the undeads and demons then collecting a final item. The story I'm forming is around the hero being a gardener who has to heal the dungeon's flora.   I had Yog teleporting at 50% chance after every hit in my previous playtesting and it was damn near impossible with him disappearing, adding regen, and spawning 3-5 eyes every time. I dropped that chance significantly for the current Playtest. Sounds like I need to increase that rate back up. I think I'll also add a couple new fists that spawn when the other ones die. Would be cool if Yog randomly rotated through 10 or so different personality fists with two in play during any given moment.   Sounds like I also need to pump the dwarf king battle up a bit as well. I nerfed the dwarf liches for this release to paralyze less and do less damage. I think I'll walk that change back. Probably need more damage resistance on the tomb as well. It is a solid block of stone afterall...  Overall though, I think you played this exactly right. Sounds like you took your time, pumped your hero and gear up and learned all the necessary tactics for a successful run. I'm hoping to add more hidden stuff and sub-quests for players that figure it out. Also a couple higher tiers of badges are certainly called for as you suggest since the gameplay is significantly different.   Thank you!"

They can side-load whenever they want to play. It would replace the normal app, but I will make the effort to update the limited version as I update the regular version. It's not too arduous as the limited features are included in the regular version, just not available to players."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri May 22 19:01:31 2015 UTC,"Can this be installed right over my old version, or does the old one need to be uninstalled first?"
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,BilbolDev,1 point,Thu May 21 14:58:57 2015 UTC,It should be able to install over if you want to keep playing. Slight chance it might bug out on you. It'd be best to finish games in progress before updating.
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 21 15:52:45 2015 UTC,It appears to have updated fine. Didn't have any games in progress to ruin. I probably should have to try to catch some odd bugs.  Looks like you lowered the monster meat and dungeon berry/nut rates? I found my first regrowth scroll. That thing's insane. Every attack in either direction is a surprise attack until you do some defoliation. Dew everywhere!
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 21 15:57:50 2015 UTC,meat and berry/nut rates should be the same. Glad you like the regrowth scroll. Very rare and worth saving for when you need some dew. I'm planning another mini-quest based off obtaining/using that scroll.
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 21 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"You added an eating enchantment?  That would go well on the royal spork, right?  (Does that thing really attack six and a half times?)"
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,NYRDS,1 point,Thu May 21 17:55:50 2015 UTC,Yep. The golden spork and eating enhancement will be limited to the playtesters' special limited-edition version of the game.   Regular game just has the regular spork without the enhancement.

PixelDungeon,36r0i1,hpp3,1 point,Thu May 21 19:23:40 2015 UTC,I love that bug. Have yet to test if it is in the Shattered source but I might keep it anyway as it's so much fun.

PixelDungeon,36r0i1,Scharnvirk,1 point,Thu May 21 21:02:23 2015 UTC,"Should the order of operations for the bless ability be swapped?  I had a -1 ring, so I watered the floor for awhile to get 100 dew and used bless.  My ring was upgraded to zero, then uncursed, resulting in a plain ring.  If the order was flipped, it would have been uncursed, making it +1, then upgraded to +2. Not sure which way was intended, so I wanted to make a mention."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,Scharnvirk,1 point,Thu May 21 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"I did tweak that a bit. It now flips the degrade minus one. so a -1 becomes 0, -2 becomes +1, etc...."

PixelDungeon,36r0i1,beautifulPrisms,1 point,Thu May 21 18:08:36 2015 UTC,Yes. Probability of generating a -3 ring is less than a -2 so it's better once uncursed.
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,hpp3,2,Thu May 21 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"It's a good change overall. You want finding a +3 item to be better than finding a -3 item. Not an identical benefit.  Oh cool! A cursed item!

PixelDungeon,36r0i1,wyvern628,1 point,Thu May 21 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"The dew vial seems to be too strong. It's not too hard to farm infinitely using it once you get 50 dew to unlock 'water'. At that point you get infinite food, infinite healing, and infinite upgrades.   I feel like the monster meat drops can be toned down a bit. I'm at dungeon level 7 and I have over 40 of them."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,broken_long_thumbkey,1 point,Thu May 21 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"I would suggest nerfing water to cost 5 drops, and allow it to be used anywhere (not only on trampled grass). It removes the farming aspect of water, but allows it to provide cover."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,broken_long_thumbkey,1 point,Thu May 21 19:08:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. The dungeon gets pretty tough as you go. I'd be interested in your thoughts on balance through the later levels as well.   I'm trying to make farming/grinding part of the game without making it too easy. Please let me know if it balances out for you.
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,broken_long_thumbkey,2,Thu May 21 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"The dew vial essentially makes it so that only bosses, or the occasional very nasty ""oh crap not three assassins"" moments are the only things that are really a significant threat.  You're essentially carrying ten reusable healing potions, in addition to the real healing potions you're carrying, that could alternately be used as an escape/combat advantage (splash), and a reusable uncurse scroll that gives random upgrades (bless). You just have to take the time every time you find a grass room to tank up on dew again.  I think this is balanced somewhat (though not really) by the fact that grass rooms get more and more rare the deeper you go.   I don't like the idea of making it usable anywhere, because that would make the regrowth wand redundant.  Right now, there's a neat little synergy with those two items. No grass around? Use the regrowth wand. Now you can water it.  I think this may all be by design, though. In addition to that dew, you have dozens of those dungeon berries, a huge seed supply, nuts galore (that you can toast!), etc. etc. I think the idea is that in between battles, you can pretty much stay fed and fully healed without too much trouble. Which is a big departure from standard Pixel Dungeon, which is a war of attrition where you spend the whole game starving, your upgraded items degrade, and it gets harder and harder to stay healed, fed, and equipped, until you barely squeak out a win at the end.  This mod seems to be more along the lines of pretty easy grinding (the monsters are toughened, but if you get a good start, so are you), but with epic and annoying boss battles. It didn't matter that I was packing a +13 vampiric knukleduster with a wand of blink. I still had to burn healing items on Tengu because he's designed to be tough. With those extra hp, I was out of blink charges pretty quickly, then slowed and on fire and cut off from that four-shurikan-a-round jerk by an entire square of sixteen poison traps."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,ian949,1 point,Thu May 21 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"I think you nailed it. I'm from the Final Fantasy school of explore and grind until you can take on the next boss. That's the goal here. EDIT: Well, not completely the goal to make this FF style grinding. It's still a RL but with some grinding. Some kind of hybrid approach.   Glad you found that the nuts can be toasted.  Don't forget to toast your nuts!"
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,Tehtacticalpanda,1 point,Thu May 21 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to make farming/grinding part of the game without making it too easy. Please let me know if it balances out for you.   Farming/grinding is my usual preferred playstyle in roguelikes, and it's how I prefer to play shattered pixel dungeon. My preliminary feeling is that farming is a bit too easy in this game, but I'll update you when I get to the late game.   Unrelated: I think the description for the dew vial needs to be updated.    ""You can store excess dew in this tiny vessel for drinking it later. The more full the vial is, the more each dew drop will heal you. A full vial is as strong as a potion of healing.  Vials like this one used to be imbued with revival magic, but that power has faded. There still seems to be some residual power left, perhaps a full vial can bless another revival item.""   This is misleading because the vial can now hold 100 drops. How about something like    ""You can store excess dew in this tiny vessel for drinking it later. The more full the vial is, the more each dew drop will heal you. 10 drops would probably be sufficient to fully heal a hero.  Vials like this one used to be imbued with revival magic, but that power has faded. There still seems to be some residual power left. Perhaps with enough drops, you could bless another revival item.""   This brings me to another problem. Currently the dew vial is able to ""bless"" in two different ways. I suggest either renaming Ankh blessing to ""imbue"" (downside is that players with a Shattered background would expect bless to refer to Ankh blessing), or rename item blessing to ""purify""."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,Tehtacticalpanda,1 point,Thu May 21 20:45:58 2015 UTC,Solid ideas. I'll make these changes...
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,Tehtacticalpanda,1 point,Thu May 21 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"On paper this mod has everything what is needed. It is based on Shattered, which itself is a major upgrade over ""standard"" Pixel Dungeon. It has huge dungeons, something I was really hoping somebody would do. There are new items, but from what I've seen they are not as absurd as in Skillful where the balance is down the drain.  Yet something is off. Huge levels mean that the gameplay is essentially just diluted, like if you split a glass of beer among two and then fill both to full with water. You have two drinks now, but you'd still prefer one ""pure"". For the most time I was travelling corridors, looking into empty rooms and clicking dew bubbles. Two ""green"" levels were enough to get REALLY pissed off by all that grass to trample, while normally I love them in Shattered and even more in classic PD.  Enemies grow with level - cool, now levels don't mean anything. A rat takes as much to kill on any level, so there is no sense of progress.  Safe meat from each mob? For warrior who I tested, free unlimited healing. Also with all that abundance of various food (dungeon berries) hunger is now a thing of the past.  But again, the biggest issue is how huge but empty the levels are. Maybe reduce their amount (so you have just two or three levels before Goo), or fill them with more items? What I'd really recommend would be reverting dungeon size to shattered-type and removing monster meat, just for testing."
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,charlielilith,1 point,Thu May 21 22:35:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. Thinking about changing the name to 'tedious' PD :)  It's a significant shift from other versions for sure. It might be helpful to think of each level as gathering resources and upgrades to face the bosses. It's still a grind though...  I'll put some thought into how to make the levels more interesting. Maybe more collectable items or special rooms would help.  Any suggestions would be welcome.
PixelDungeon,36r0i1,ian949,1 point,Thu May 21 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"To make such big levels interesting you need to put way more items in there, but that would also mean inflation of the endgame level and require rebalancing everything.   Part of this tediousness is that for the most time, there is really nothing interesting happening. Finding a boss pack of rats was very cool. Fighting rats and nothing else for 15 minutes was awful. In 15 minutes in SD I'd be already past Goo and chasing a thief. Unfortunately the remedy to this is more variety which leads to more content and more balancing. More mob types, more item types (not necessarily very powerful), such things. Gelatinous glob, Gnoll Pup, Rabid Dog, Ant - to name few low level mobs. Rusty sword, Club, Buckler - some tier-1 weapons. More variety yet not op.  One cool thing that could be made to levels is generating few of them as if they were separate instances and then putting them on one level grid - separated by a special locked door which would require a key found in a previous section. Essentially the same thing with levels, just more horizontal :)"

PixelDungeon,36rd4h,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 21 14:57:23 2015 UTC,I'm sure that the wraith took a step for every step i took so I don't think he had 1 more move than me
PixelDungeon,36rd4h,NCOSRane,3,Thu May 21 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"If your strength is just one or two less than what's required for the armor, enemies might move 2:1 only once every few steps.  I'm assuming your strength was less than what you needed for your mail armor. You were only in depth 2, and if you had 13 strength already (meaning both strength potions for depths 1-5 were on depths 1 and 2, which isn't horribly likely), you would have been wearing that mail armor full-time and not switching it out.  Wraiths die in one hit anyway, so you don't really need to deck yourself out in heavy armor to fight them."
PixelDungeon,36rd4h,SGAdventures,1 point,Thu May 21 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only reason that you wouldn't get the surprise attack is if:  a) you were not strong enough to wear the armour (from what you've said the armour was probably only 1 str to high if this was the case)  b) the doors weren't open...  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that the doors were probably closed :P  Opening up graves is not normally the best idea, best way to do it is if you have magic damage, a boomerang and invis potion, or a toxic gas potion handy. (_)  In future if you have heavy armour try running to the dungeon stairs, going up and then down again will give you a surprise attack every time. This can be repeated and as you are not technically 'walking' there's no disadvantage to wearing your fancy armour."

PixelDungeon,36oe8p,SGAdventures,1 point,Sat May 23 22:31:04 2015 UTC,"For early game it's definitely the warrior, bonus strength plus best starting weapon.   Late game it's the assassin , the bonus sneak atk damage really hurts with a good weapon.  Mage is whatever, but the battlemage really needs a good wand for its full potential.  Huntress is tricky, her early game is decent because you can kite with the boomerang but she is squishy, and her late game is good with sniper and upgraded boomerang...  And for tips, keep your distance,  open doors with items , and abuse the hell out of your boomerang, that thing rocks"
PixelDungeon,36oe8p,Yokoya,1 point,Wed May 20 23:58:16 2015 UTC,"Sniper is the best class imo. At least for my play style. She is the weakest early game, but once you get past Goo, she's pretty strong till the city.  Go slow. Spend your first 2-3 upgrades on your boomerang and save scrolls for a good armour (Pray the ghost is friendly). Weightstone (non-shattered) for speed is a must for huntress.  Make use of invisibility(non-shattered) or mind vision + paralytic gas for boss battles. Honeypots are good for awkward situations.  Against Goo, use seed of dreamweed   Against Tengu, use seed of earthroot  Against DM-300, use mindvision + paralytic gas.  Against Dwarf King, use invisibility potion or mindvision + paralytic gas..  Against Yog, use invisibility potion or mindvision + paralytic gas.  As with all classes, a little luck is required. Non-battle wands are useful for her, especially wand of blink."
PixelDungeon,36oe8p,gohjohn,1 point,Thu May 21 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"The strongest class is probably assassin. Rogue dodging is probably the only special class perk that never gets outdated or marginalized by late-game. And extra damage every time you play the door trick on a monster or manage to catch one asleep or at an odd corner ain't shabby either. And they need less food.  Compare that to the ever-popular warrior. Sure, one extra strength, starting with a shortsword, healing 5 hp when you eat food, and being able to reforge the sword later helps you get past all of those sewer crabs and the goo. But when you're getting decimated by dwarf warlocks and golems, you're going to wish you could dodge, not heal 5 hp by eating. Those warrior perks get outdated.  Battlemages hardly ever have to worry about an empty wand, but before you get to that point, you have to find a wand you actually want to upgrade. Most people prefer warlocks for that reason, though their healing/food power stops working when a monster's not worth experience, so their special perk eventually stops doing anything.  The huntress is a very skill and item-based class. You have to be careful with every step and take advantage of every inch of range you can get. A highly upgraded boomerang is nothing to laugh at, especially if enchanted, but it's still just a tier-1 weapon. It's best in the hands of the sniper subclass since snipers ignore armor and slow down the targets they hit. Warden is probably the weakest subclass in the game. It still has its perks, but when you think about the assassin, life seems pretty unbalanced. All that said, sniper is, by far, my favorite class. People insist that the huntress is just there as a lesser class to make the game more challenging, but I think the sniper is a real contender, if played right."

PixelDungeon,36hzr2,OldManBilly,3,Tue May 19 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"The warlock gives you a weakened debuff, so don't walk to them, go behind a corner or door and kill them.  Another troublesome guy is the monk, use your wands first and finish him off with your weapon, because if he gets close enough to attack you, he can disarm you.  The golem and fire elemental is just dps, but the elemental puts you on fire, so try to fight him  in water, while the golem hurts pretty bad, so watch out for your health.  And that's pretty much it, good luck buddy!"
PixelDungeon,36hzr2,Yokoya,2,Tue May 19 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"Golem swatted me to death last night with 15 healing potions. I had almost 1/5th of my health and he just killed me.   I felt like quite the fool.   Op, always run from the wizards into a spot where you can hit them first. Their attack hits hard and will weaken you (still not 100% sure of what this affect does, but it's bad) but they can't use it if you are in melee range.   Light monks on fire, poison them, whatever you got and always have a doorway behind you to retreat behind. While retreating, don't drop your sword lol  Fire elementals you want to be standing in water to fight or you're going to be the human torch.   Remember to always fulfill the Ambitious Imp's quest. +3 ring and access to one last shop."
PixelDungeon,36hzr2,Concani,2,Tue May 19 15:38:19 2015 UTC,Ummm I have to ask why you are using a weapon you don't have the strength for?  This makes it more inaccurate and more turns pass for every hit you do. That's not a good thing after floor 11 lol

PixelDungeon,36hzr2,SGAdventures,1 point,Wed May 20 06:24:05 2015 UTC,"Hey well done!! Looking pretty good, you're going to need to start getting some upgrade scrolls in your high tier weapons though, do you know what rating the Glaive is? By the looks of it, until you get some upgrade scrolls into your weapons you're going to be relying pretty heavily on ultility items (so your wands).  You're going to want the scroll holder at somepoint as the fireballs WILL destroy all your scrolls so fast. Also with your wands don't forget that you can do things like shooting the wall next to you with a teleport to teleport yourself somewhere. Always handy.   The monks are a pain, especially since you don't have any damage output at the moment. Try and kite them a lot and remember that magics like amok DON'T affect them!  As Yokoya says the warlocks are your bane at the moment. Their weakened debuff their ranged attack applies lowers your strength by 2 for 40 turns (not fun!) you can fix this with either a health potion or a remove curse scroll which you don't seem to have, but if you do, that's always a possibility.  I unfortunately don't have a tutorial vid up for the dwarven depths yet, but it's coming slowly. Hopefully in the next week or so it will be. But I understand if you can't wait that long ;)  As far as strategy for you goes. Don't let warlocks hit you from range. Fight fireballs when standing on water. Kite the monks through doors and hit them with those lovely javlins and tomohawks to cripple them. Then stutter step backwards (attack, run, attack, run like hell) ideally they won't be able to hit you much if you get your timings right. As for golems... run. You are not strong enough to fight them you need more Armour, better weapons or an evasion ring to do that. They don't drop anything and they hit like a truck. The only time you should be killing them (in any game) is for experience, you're already level 19 you're going to hit the level cap (26) before yogi anyway so don't stress about it. If you absolutely have to fight them then remember that they attack 1.5 times slower than you. This means if you're kiting through doors then let him hit you once, walk through and you'll get 2 100% accuracy attacks off. Also the stairs trick works. (go up, down attack, up down attack) for 100% accuracy with each hit.  Otherwise you're on your own.  Good luck!!!"

Collect health potions and buy any ankh. Bless ankh by collecting dewdrops.  This is the easiest character to consistently beat the game.

Firstly....you will need a better weapon, hopefully you will get one. You can beat the game with the knuckle duster but on depth 8 and no upgrades on the one you're using, but I'm guessing you have 2 scrolls of upgrade too. Wait it out a bit for a better weapon and use your upgrades on that. IF you feel like you have to upgrade and it depends on your life, then do it. This game is all about risks and acting on impulse. Trust me, it may work out or it may not. Try not to use your healing potions a lot. Obviously, use then when you HAVE to. Those wands will help, definitely, I hope they're battle wands for Tengu. One thing i would suggest doing is placing the location of the  lloyds becon in random places, so if you're nearly caught in a corner of monsters, teleport before they come too close (this saved me a ton of times) and im guessing you know, no teleporting in boss rooms. Good luck!"

It's an accurate weapon (I think +20% accuracy?) and does extra lucky damage, so you should have an easier time taking down those dodgy bats before they heal themselves, and quickly dispatching enraged brutes. You're having a bad run because you haven't found any real armor yet. Brutes do respectable damage even with real armor. And the more damage bats do to you, they more they heal."

There are not ranged enemies around in the caves (apart from depth 13 where you will find zappy gnolls),  avalanche can stun, and you have crippling etc. Use upgrade scrolls on the axe till it's +2 and by then hopefully you will have found some armour that you REALLY need to get some upgrades in stat!

Yeah, if you get a firebolt/disintegration wand, just upgrade the heck out of it and win the game on easy mode. But you can do pretty well with poison, amok, and slow wands if you play strategically. A lot of people just find a blasting wand and forget about the 6-10 other wands in their wand holder. Heck, if you don't mind taking all year, you can beat some guy to death over the head with a +12 regrowth wand, nearly die in the process, then grow a bunch of dewdrops to recover your hp. Not to mention regrowth roots enemies, detects traps, gives you an endless supply of offensive and defensive seeds.

PixelDungeon,362imb,Monorail5,1 point,Fri May 15 21:02:46 2015 UTC,I've also tested that if you get to 21 and there's no shop. Going back and finishing the imp quest does not make the shop spawn.
PixelDungeon,364okh,Jasdacool,2,Sat May 16 02:46:40 2015 UTC,"Locked room with no key? Try checking inside the room. Fall down from a chasm room on the depth above. Said chasm room has to have around half of the tiles there being planks.  I'm pretty sure that there can only be one golden key. You have gold chest rooms and crystal chest rooms, and I'm fairly certain there can only be one of either type, and therefore only one gold key - otherwise you would be able to pick up both crystal chest items, and that isn't the point of those rooms.  There is only the secret Rat King room for Goo."

PixelDungeon,361rw7,lonko,3,Fri May 15 11:13:53 2015 UTC,"I unlocked her last week and have gotten to around d17 with her.  I use the boomerang as much as possible and upgrade it early. I finished last time with it at +3 but I'm going to try upgrading it a lot more than anything else and see how that goes. I also use projectile weapons a lot because she gets a strength bonus with them. I'm thinking a strategy similar to the one from this comment might work well except with the boomerang and projectiles instead of wands.  Because she starts with less health than the other characters, I usually try to keep her one or 2 levels above my current depth. A potion of might would probably help a lot too but I didn't know how to make these until yesterday.  You can also use her sensing abilities to your advantage. For example, avoid rooms with monsters right behind the door if your health is low til you can regain some of it and come back.  Hope this helps."
PixelDungeon,361rw7,filosophuck,3,Fri May 15 13:49:46 2015 UTC,"So sniper is, in my opinion, definitely the weakest class without a tome: so getting that is important. Because of that, just treat the game like Tengu is the final boss. I would recommend identifying every potion and scroll at the end of each level so you have all the ammunition you need to win. Potions of strength are your best friend. Crabs are going to be your biggest enemy, they can kill you in a few hits, so treat them like would bosses, don't be afraid to waste seeds or potions on them if you need to. I think the most important thing to remember about the sniper to elevate your game is that she recovers one projectile every time from enemies. That means you can lure an enemy to a door, hit them with a curare or flame dart, then recover it right after they're dead. So treat projectiles (flame, curare and javelin especially) like gold, you really really want those.   I would recommend investing all of your upgrade scrolls in armor. I know this sub is really into the idea of pouring them all into the boomerang but I think without the sniper tome, the boomerang suffers and armor is probably your best bet in sustaining a run to Level 10. So on that sad ghost quest, always go with the armor. If you have more than one arcane stylus, use them. You might want to wait for Tengu but it isn't necessary. On levels 1-4 displacement is huge for the sniper, and entanglement is perfect against Tengu.   Last thing, if you find one of those rooms with the gold key where it gives you a choice between two chests and one of them is a wand, take the wand every time. You know it won't be cursed, and a wand of blink, amok, or slowness will give you a huge huge advantage because you want to gain as much distance as possible from your enemies at all times."
PixelDungeon,361rw7,Gorbonzo,3,Fri May 15 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"Pre-sniper, the huntress has it a little rough in depths 1-5. Missing 5 hp and starting out with crap gear and no combat bonuses means you have to find non-crap gear if you want to beat Tengu.  That said, play like you're a sniper. Learn all the boomerang tricks to hit people around corners and down bent hallways. Upgrade your boomerang unless you find a good weapon, armor, or ring early on (like if you find a +3 longsword and need one more upgrade to be able to use it, go with that instead of your boomerang). Drink every strength potion right away. Ask for armor from the ghost quest.  Tengu's ranged attacks are going to be better than yours, though, so unless you've lucked into getting a good enchantment on your boomerang or it's amazingly upgraded, you probably want to get next to him. So you're going to need to have lucked into a decent weapon and armor before depth 10.  It may not be a bad idea to do a muscle run first. Play like you're a warrior. Get and upgrade the first decent weapon and armor you find, get to 10, brute-force your way past Tengu with little intention/hope of actually winning that run, then on your next run, you can get the sniper bonuses and actually play like a sniper."
PixelDungeon,361rw7,NCOSRane,2,Fri May 15 14:44:00 2015 UTC,"If you're going to go with a pure sniper and pump up the boomerang, the key to winning the game is making sure you have invisibility potions for the bosses. While invisible, you can use missile weapons and your boomerang, basically doing unchecked damage. I don't think I took any damage from a boss in the game until Yog Dewza."

PixelDungeon,361rw7,Diasl,1 point,Fri May 15 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give is to read the ""Pro as heck guide to Sniper"" which is here:  http://pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:TheDarkoko/Pro_as_heck_guide_to_Sniper"
PixelDungeon,362moe,Jack1216,5,Fri May 15 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"When you're new at Pixel Dungeon, beating Goo is a win. That's a really good first benchmark to set for yourself. (Actually, when you're very, very new, just making it past the crabs to Goo is a pretty big first success.)  First off, I'd stick with the warrior class. The starting shortsword, the extra point of strength, and the healing 5 hp when eating perks make the first 5-10 levels a lot easier than the other class' perks. I think most people feel like rogues are the best, end-game, but since right now you're still working on getting past the Goo, stick with warrior.  Second, clean out every level. Do not skip anything. On the first floor, there are no secret doors, no traps, so don't waste time and energy searching. But on subsequent floors, there can be. If a level starts out by telling you there are a lot of secrets, you know there's at least one hidden feature.  Third, grind a little bit. Do not descend to the next floor down until your level is at least equal to the floor you're about to go down to. In your case, you might even want to grind until 6 or 7 before you go down to fight Goo. This isn't just to make you strong enough to fight monsters. The loot that populates on a new level when you enter it is based on your level at the time you descend. If you're under-leveled when you go down some stairs, you get worse items.  Fourth, ID your supplies. Once you've cleaned out a level, before you head down the stairs, stop and recite every unidentified scroll you're holding.  Make sure you have most of your health when you do this in case you summon a bunch of crabs to your room or something.  Use the first upgrade scroll you find this way on your shortsword.  For potions, drink your strength potions first (they come pre-identified for warriors), make sure you drop all of your scrolls somewhere far from you, stand in water, and stand near a doorway. That way, you won't destroy your scrolls if you drink a liquid flame potion (and it'll go out fast), and you'll be able to leave the room quickly if you drink a gas potion. The main purpose of this is so you'll know where your healing potions are when you fight Goo.  Fifth, go ahead and be a little daring with gear. You're not that far into the game yet. If you find a better weapon or armor and don't have an identification scroll, put it on and figure it out through use. If it's a horribly cursed piece of equipment and you don't have an uncurse scroll, that's the breaks. So maybe you lose that run if you don't find an uncurse scroll soon. For heavy armor, don't run around in it (you move slowly and get hungry quickly if your strength is less than what you need to wear the armor). Put it on when you see monsters and let them come to you. For weapons, use surprise attacks -- get a monster to follow you through a door. While the monster is in the doorway, your next attack will automatically hit, even if you're using a weapon that's too heavy for you. If you're trying out a weapon and a monster is getting multiple attacks back at you, or if you're trying out a weapon and doing more than its normal damage, that can clue you in on its worth before it self-identifies from use. If you come across a tier-4 or tier-5 weapon or armor, it's okay to upgrade it a little bit. That'll seal the deal against Goo.  Sixth, pretend Goo is the final boss of the game. Plant an earthroot seed right outside of the door to his room. Then stand in the doorway of his room and plant a negative seed (fire, sorrowmoss, etc.), throw some dart or something at him, retreat through the doorway and let him step on the negative seed while you get the benfeit of earthroot, take a free attack with your weapon. Trade hits until earthroot wears off.  Run away and lead him through the next door. Take your free hit. (Maybe even set up an earthroot or sungrass just on the other side of that door, too for you to get.) Just remember that his hits can cause caustic ooze damage, so step on water to get rid of it. And if he starts shuddering for his super attack, back at least two steps away and he'll stop. Throw a ranged weapon at him and let him come to you again."

PixelDungeon,362moe,NCOSRane,2,Fri May 15 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah. One more thing on Goo. He heals every turn that he ends when he's on water. If you can position yourself right, you want to be in water while he's on land. That way, caustic ooze wears off on you immediately, and he's not healing."

I guess this is about as much protection as you can get from leather armor.  The run ended badly. Golems were hitting for ~40 quite often and eventually I misjudged remaining health and died.  Still - if you are careful around golems and then succubi (or skip Demon Halls), then you should be able to do it. Just don't engage the green fist, it is hell of a golem ;p"

PixelDungeon,361clp,BilbolDev,1 point,Fri May 15 12:14:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely the most difficult PD mode currently available.  I can’t begin to express how many hours I’ve poured into making this happen.  I got lucky with an early dual swords, followed by a ring of evasion +1 (Which I spent almost all my scrolls on). And towards the end I got a wand of blink to seal the game. By the end of the game, I was so nervous that I made sure nothing got near enough to hit me.  Also, why does attacking Scorpios hurt so much? Is this something new?   Thank you /u/BilbolDev for making such an awesome mod.   I’m considering making a guide specific to Huntress in Skillful PD in the not-so-near future :)"
PixelDungeon,361clp,aushack,2,Fri May 15 07:14:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the ping. Congratulations. I have no idea how you did it in 200 attempts. I'm at about 400 and still not past level 4, and only reached it twice. My strategy is to throw arrows at all the doors to keep the corridor visible. Throw darts at rats which are off screen. Use stairs to go down and sleep then hit and repeat if you get stuck. I've had dual swords, vampiric glaves, plate +3, wand firebolt +5 but still cannot survive. A single bite from a poisonous rat is the end, and EVERY TIME there is a blazing necroblade or armour it is protected by multiple god rats that I can't get into the room without dying. I even clear a room, pick up the object and a rat spawns in those few steps with no escape."
PixelDungeon,361clp,aushack,1 point,Fri May 15 07:36:19 2015 UTC,"In those 200+ games, I definitely improved and optimized my huntress game.  Snipers are cowards. So should you be. Run and minimize risks. Skip rooms if you know its not possible. Always be 1 level above the depth you are going to.  Read this very good guide, especially this section. For difficult shots outside of what is described, it'll come with experience.. After a while you will get a hang of shots with awkward angles.  There are also tricks for running away. If you have at least one space gap between you and the enemy, it is possible to escape with certain conditions. Observe how the AI works. From this is how the turn goes:   Your move (Assuming your move is one full turn long) Checks if enemy can see you. If yes, goes towards you If no, goes towards your last seen location. If at your last seen location, but doesn't see you, wait at least one turn before going to a random spot on the map.   This sequence is important. For example, you just came from the door the rat is at, instead of attacking it, move one space to the left. The rat will now lose sight of you and you can get a free hit in. And sometimes the rat will just walk away.  Also, when you teleport an enemy away, they will go towards your last known spot if possible, so wait and prepare.  There are more tips to talk about, I'll put them in a guide in the future."
PixelDungeon,361clp,aushack,2,Fri May 15 08:10:23 2015 UTC,"So got the book. Forgot the sniper zeroed in buff gives a ring of haste type effect. Makes fighting easier. Edit: yep, even made it to goo first attempt."
PixelDungeon,361clp,aushack,1 point,Fri May 15 12:37:23 2015 UTC,Well done!  Getting to Goo marks a good run. I feel the first four levels are harder than the last 20 levels.
PixelDungeon,361clp,aushack,1 point,Fri May 15 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The sniper zero in buff gives me an extra 6 turns on average per rat. When you only have 4 turns before a single bite death, 4 becoming 8 turns means I can now kill them before they get close. I had +2 blazing dual swords and a plate armour (too heavy to bother using). With a seed of armour. But no health potions or food, my only choice was to battle Goo with 8 hit points with lasted all of 2 seconds. But now I am a sniper I also think it is winnable. I'd love to see someone win as a huntress without sniper though in suicide. Do you dare? :)"
PixelDungeon,361clp,aushack,1 point,Sat May 16 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"I never liked warden. To me she's equal to a non-subclassed huntress.  Also, real life knocks on my door, this sniper run will probably be the last big PD run I'll do.  I don't think i'm gonna try warden. You can go for it. ;)"
PixelDungeon,360bsg,iBazly,5,Fri May 15 00:43:29 2015 UTC,"Now I haven't played vanilla in a while, but as you (and I suppose Evan) pointed out, degradation is the big one. But there are other small ways that shattered gives you an edge. Blandfruits are a big one. Namely the Sunfruit. Sure it's basically just one healing potion, but if you can get passed the Goo without using a health potion (using the Sunfruit instead), you can usually snowball this into not using the health potion until the next store. This saves valuable money and can make a real difference in the long run.   Artifacts are also pretty important to mention because of their properties that differentiate them from rings. They provide unique abilities or passive buffs that upgrade by use, not upgrade scrolls. Thus you can have a fairly useful artifact by the end of the run without wasting upgrade scrolls on it. Another big thing about artifacts is that they are completely useful even if they were once cursed. With cursed rings, you always have a -1 or -2 tacked on, but with artifacts just use a scroll of remove curse and you're good to go.   One last thing would be the variety of the sad ghost's quest on levels 2-4. In my opinion, the fetid rat is the hardest to deal with, so getting the great crab and especially the gnoll trickster is always great.   I'm sure there are plenty of other differences but I never played vanilla that much, hope this helped you out!  EDIT: I'll probably keep thinking of more, but one big one is the Ankh ""nerf."" The ability to bless Ankh's using the dew vial was really more of a buff than anything because it allows you to bless multiple Ankh's, giving you multiple lives as opposed to just the one dew vial life. But I don't know the update history on Watabou's end so it might be like that in vanilla as well."

PixelDungeon,35x5mo,Relsre,4,Thu May 14 06:37:37 2015 UTC,"So this YASD happened 4 months ago, after which I just didn't play it anymore. I was so fed up with losing so much progress into 'personally uncharted' depths of PD, namely, anything beyond DM-300. After beating DM-300 for the first time, I ventured through the Dwarven City, beat the King of Dwarves after a lengthy fight, and braved through the Demon Halls. I just got a literal glimpse of the Yog for the first time ever, before being killed unknowingly within that room with no exits.  I do understand PD is a roguelike, and such losses should be expected. Perhaps that YASD just burnt me out for a while; perhaps to you guys, this death isn't even worth looking over.

PixelDungeon,35x5mo,JoshuMertens,2,Thu May 14 06:42:00 2015 UTC,Nice man! May the dungeon gods be in your favor
PixelDungeon,35vd6x,ShekelCollector,10,Wed May 13 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"Go all out. Do not be stingy with items. Treat every fight like it's a major boss fight.  Your magic missile wand should be empty all the time from softening up enemies until they're in melee range. You should run behind a door to take a free hit (two free hits with that starting knuckleduster) as soon as you've got a monster next to you. If there's another door not that far across the room, lead him through that one next and do the same thing. If you're feeling daring, the door trick works with any type of hit, so if you find a powerful weapon and lack the strength, you can equip it, lead a monster through a door, and bash it with that weapon. (But if you don't kill it, that monster's taking a few free licks on you.) Unlike the 11 strength, shortsword-wielding warrior, you do not start out equipped to trade blows with enemies, so you've got to cheat a little bit to stack the deck.  You can't afford to not know what your potions and scrolls are, since you'll need them, so after clearing a level, find somewhere safe and recite every unknown scroll (use your first upgrade on your magic missile wand unless you've already found a firebolt, disintegration (or maybe lightning) wand (or a ring of magic) by the time you use that first upgrade). Then drink every unknown potion (drop your upgrade scrolls somewhere safe first if you haven't identified the liquid flame potion yet).  Use seeds and offensive scrolls and potions liberally as needed. Don't be stingy. Even if you don't ""need"" that seed to win this fight, the extra 5hp damage you don't take this fight might be what survives you through the next one. Don't bother saving a strength potion in case you find a transmutation well. Drink them as soon as you have them. The extra points of damage add up. You can always backtrack to a well with your next strength potion.  Except for that first upgrade scroll you used on your magic missile wand, save every additional upgrade scroll unless you find a firebolt or disintegration wand (or maybe lightning if you're in a pinch).  Make sure you've at least leveled up to the level of the floor you're about to descend to before you go down.  Odds are, before depth 5, you're going to have found at least one weapon and armor better than your starting cloth and knuckleduster. Otherwise, you're going to have a hard time with goo. You might be able to eke one out with seeds, potions, etc. But then you'll just be fighting skeletons with a knuckleduster, which is silly.  The floor with the mage quest is where you need to get. Find that guy his rotberry or corpse dust and request a combat wand (unless you found a firebolt or disintegration wand earlier and have already dumped your upgrade scrolls into it).  Even then, you can probably request another combat wand. If you get a duplicate, the troll blacksmith later on can reforge your second into another upgrade. Sometimes, this guy screws you with an avalanche or poison wand.  You can make poison work if you're really meticulous, but avalanche is stupid.  Upgrade a firebolt, disintegration (or lightning in a pinch) wand to at least +7 before you worry about upgrading any rings or armor. That gives you 9 charges. If you have a ring of magic, I'd put every upgrade into that afterward. Maybe a little into plate armor if you find some, but mostly offense. If you don't have any good rings or armor, just keep upgrading your combat wand with every single upgrade scroll, as soon as you find it.  Unlike most of the people around here, I strongly prefer battlemage over warlock. After you beat tengu, go battlemage and equip that wand. You're going to do more damage by blasting people with firebolts or disintegration rays than you will by dividing your upgrades between a conventional weapon and a wand. I'd just as soon pump more upgrades into the wand and zap targets, then hit them to recharge the wand when I'm empty.  Honestly, with a +12 or greater firebolt (best) or disintegration wand, you're going to tear up most enemies in 1-2 shots."
PixelDungeon,35vd6x,NCOSRane,2,Wed May 13 22:15:08 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I couldn't ask for anything more helpful.
PixelDungeon,35vd6x,Concani,2,Thu May 14 00:22:38 2015 UTC,For mages always try to pick your battleground. Never be afraid to run as far as you need to get behind a door for that first hit opportunity. Remember mages are squishy because of lower HP so try not to get hit obviously. Make strategic use of potions and seeds as well. Why fight a skeleton when you can fight a burning skeleton?  Once you make it to level 10 and beat the Tengu (you hope) I recommend the Warlock class as the easier class to beat the game with.

PixelDungeon,35ny2c,gohjohn,3,Tue May 12 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"I like that change. The beacon is hella versatile. It's not just a teleport back to the shop. You can set any place as your teleport and use it to escape danger, get around the level faster, or set it in a doorway and use it like a wand of blink. The beacon is powerful, but it's a 100% utility item, not a fighting item. That's the choice with most of the artifacts/rings. They're either utility or fighting items, and you have to decide which ones to equip and when.  I don't want to fight a bad guy wearing my thief armband, but if I take it off, I lose a big chunk of its charge. That ring of wealth isn't helping me kill anybody. Nor is that talisman but God forbid I go through the demon hall levels without it. If I don't have any armor charge in my nature greaves, they're worthless in a fight, but it's a pain to swap them on and off every time I see some grass."

PixelDungeon,35ny2c,kimbolslice,2,Tue May 12 07:38:57 2015 UTC,"The choice to make it yellow was to differentiate from the assassin's blood splat. I'm also not aware there was an old style in earlier update, could you elaborate on that?"
PixelDungeon,35ny2c,shanksmanship,1 point,Tue May 12 11:44:14 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, but it's just a bit too large in my opinion. My thought was that when the mob rounded a corner or opened a door there would be an exclamation point just like when you awaken a mob.

PixelDungeon,35ny2c,burdturgler1154,2,Wed May 13 01:13:03 2015 UTC,"wow amazing work but with more artifacts we have more issue  like  the  slot issues, we should have another extra slot (maybe specific slots for rings and some for artifacts) rings becoming useless : well rings  are getting weaker and weaker  and upgrading them are making us losing scrolls when artifacts can lvl with the enviroment , you should rework  that part maybe making rings get % level if you use them , like ring of magic getting % every time you use a wand  or ring of might by eating . and the ring for fist fighting you could maybe make it be able to use on the weapon slot ... since well you wear the ring on your hand and your hand have nothing else to do , and of course make it level up for every blow you deal (maybe).  about the rougue and the cape, you could maybe remove the cloak and make it a self skill ( of course you shoulda need to add skills to the other clases for balancing)  anyway this is a great update =)"

It makes sense that a creature opening a door to meet a falling axe will get suprised, but if that creature is actively chasing you and is right on you, it won't be surprised if it passes a door during the chase.  What I'd suggest would making the door trick work only if the doors were indeed closed for at least one turn.

PixelDungeon,35ny2c,crackadillicus,1 point,Tue May 12 21:47:58 2015 UTC,"I never bothered with the Alchemist's Toolkit... can anyone explain how to use it properly? Probably wrong, but the way I understood it, you had to try some combination of three potions. Since potions are pretty valuable to me, I never wanted to even bother and potentially waste them trying to figure out the proper combination. So, then if you're lucky enough, you get some benefit? Is that how it works?"
PixelDungeon,35ny2c,Scharnvirk,2,Tue May 12 21:58:16 2015 UTC,"That's right. You're playing mastermind, half-blindfolded. You drop in three potions, it tells you how many were the right type-right spot, how many were right type-wrong spot, and based on how close you were, the kit gets upgraded. You then try again and again, wasting countless potions. The device only records your subjective ""best"" mix, so you're on your own remembering other things you tried that didn't work.  After expending a bajillion valuable potions this way, what do you get from that upgraded alchemist kit? You can make potions for a smaller number of seeds. So you burned through 30 potions upgrading that kit, all so you can now go consume 60 seeds instead of 90 replacing those 30 potions.  Big cost, crap reward. An item that helps with alchemy is a fine idea, but this one was completely unbalanced. Why would you expend your limited number of real potions for a slim chance at getting to spend more of your limited resources...making potions?"

PixelDungeon,35nfqb,floatingcoffins,2,Tue May 12 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"Slow and steady is best imo.  Only feed it when it's max damage is less than your hp. There is actually no need to max out the level.  A trick is to use seed of earth root to mitigate some damage (about 100 iirc).  If you are desperate for the final levels, feel free to use a spare blessed ankh or two for the final upgrades."
PixelDungeon,35nfqb,gohjohn,1 point,Tue May 12 07:14:07 2015 UTC,"By the last half of the game, you're starving 90% of the time unless you've been really conservative with food. Making the ankh, earthroot seeds, and piles of health you dumped into your chalice a lost investment unless you're also sitting on a fully upgraded horn.  It's a decent item, but the very second you find one, stop eating entirely and start treating your food like a magical healing item that gives you short-term regeneration - eat only when needed."
PixelDungeon,35nfqb,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue May 12 15:04:19 2015 UTC,Starving towards the last half? I'm never out of food in PD.  We most have a pretty different play style.
PixelDungeon,35nfqb,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue May 12 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"I go slow and steady, methodically clear out every floor, run back down hallways to use the door trick every time a fight will allow for it, and grind until I'm at least the same level as the depth I'm about to descend to before I go down a floor. When my inventory gets full, I'll often run upstairs a few floors to sell off excess gear. If I find some gear, I'll often fight with it (sometimes going upstairs to fight easier stuff) to identify it. I don't even skip the demon halls, usually, unless I'm having a middling run where my gear's not great and I'm low on healing potions.  I'm starving all the time, but usually over-leveled, full of healing potions, full of gold and gear."
PixelDungeon,35ldv6,Nethernox,3,Mon May 11 13:28:47 2015 UTC,In order to obtain a scroll of enchantment all you need to do is throw a scroll of upgrade into a well of transmutation (the well with the butterflies flying over it)
PixelDungeon,35ldv6,mdskrzypczyk,2,Mon May 11 13:42:52 2015 UTC,I got a vampiric longsword/blazing glaive but both lost their enchants through upgrades... Not sure how to counteract this. Just leave the vampiric longsword as is?  That won't do for higher levels...
PixelDungeon,35ldv6,NCOSRane,2,Mon May 11 15:49:42 2015 UTC,"The general strategy is to enchant a weapon after upgrading the heck out of it, and hope for a good enchantment.  I believe the odds of an enchantment surviving when you upgrade an enchanted weapon are 1/N, where N is the weapon's current level when you try to upgrade it.  So you can go from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 with no risk of losing your enchantment.  But going from 2 to 3 has a 1/N (50%) chance of keeping your enchantment.  3 to 4 has a 1/3 (33%), 4 to 5 = 25% and so on. So you could get lucky, but probably not.  Using an infusion scroll on an enchanted weapon upgrades it while keeping the current enchantment (it would add a random enchantment if you used it on a non-enchanted weapon). You can get infusion scrolls by tossing an upgrade scroll into a well of transmutation.  There's guaranteed to be at least one transmutation well in the game somewhere. If you're lucky, you might get more than one in a run. You can also get infusion scrolls if you have a ring of wealth. Each time you descend to a new depth, there's a chance (based on your ring's level) of that level containing an infusion scroll or a might potion.  Also of note, the warrior's shortsword (if upgraded) can be reforged to upgrade another weapon. This reforging doesn't risk losing an enchantment on the receiving weapon (so save your shortsword reforge for later in the game if you can). It doesn't add an enchantment. Just doesn't risk losing one.  Another note: while the troll blacksmith quest reward calls itself forging, this functions just like a normal upgrade and can still cost you your enchantment."

Particularly because health is low, monsters have much more health, all monsters are poisonous, vampiric or weakening and health potions only give 25% health. Heavily relied on rings, wands and mana to survive. The city level I had 20 health potions but the first cave level I used them all - the vampiric and poisonous angry gnolls really really hurt! Used the dew vial about 6 times. Probably the hardest part was the lack of good weapons - knuckleduster was the best drop, and I kept getting Eldritch enchantment so fighting the spell casting dwarves, vampiric monks and poisonous fireballs was very difficult! They kept running away so I had to keep hiding because of suicide mode death is easy. Heavily relied on paralysis + toxic gas, or dream weed confusion with grass fires and fadeleaf teleport seeds."

PixelDungeon,35h669,Natinals,1 point,Sun May 10 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"Do you beat the normal game or Shattered, easily?"
PixelDungeon,35h669,callmeWia,3,Sun May 10 14:22:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are rather easy to win. But suicide mode is what it says it is - a single bite from a rat will usually kill you. Definitely 4 bites. And the rats die and resurrect as poisonous zombie rats. So you're talking 10-15 hits to kill a single rat and the hero can die from 1-4 bites, it really is hard. Especially the vampire rats that steal your single digit health points and restore their own."
PixelDungeon,35h669,Scharnvirk,1 point,Sun May 10 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"That game sounds terrifying. Do you think you can give me some tips to beat Shattered? I played the game maybe times and know quite a bit about it. I beat the normal game a couple of times before. I have no problem getting thru the stages till the last 2 areas. The one with monks it's tough but manageable. The one with the death winks is challenging for me. If I don't have a vampiric weapon, it will be impossible."
PixelDungeon,35h669,portezbie,1 point,Sun May 10 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"Always fight behind doors at angles. The eyes shouldn't get you. If they do, try walking away - you can usually beat them. Or wand of slowness. Or use a wand of teleport against a wall or a fadeleaf to escape. Hide behind grass or go down a level to sleep then return.  Invisibly is good too."
PixelDungeon,35h669,gohjohn,1 point,Mon May 11 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"For starters, skip the Demon Halls with magic mapping."
PixelDungeon,35h669,andersjoh,1 point,Sun May 10 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, I always do that, is that the only strat tho?"
PixelDungeon,35h669,gohjohn,1 point,Sun May 10 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"It is about many minute optimisations which together make a win, not any single strategy; at least not in PD. Skipping Demon Halls is a good thing to do, but generally speaking if you can get there, you will eventually win."
PixelDungeon,35j0lz,fill_your_hand,3,Sun May 10 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"Shattered changed the mechanic because it was a free revive. Now you have to bless, just a button on the item description, an ankh to get a revive. This makes the game more interesting in my opinion."
PixelDungeon,35j0lz,sfiodsh,3,Sun May 10 21:16:41 2015 UTC,"So if I understand correctly, I have to bless my dew vial with an ankh in order for it to activate upon death?"
PixelDungeon,35j0lz,sfiodsh,2,Sun May 10 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"Other way around, but the effect is as you said."
PixelDungeon,35j0lz,Concani,2,Sun May 10 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"Understood, thanks for helping."
PixelDungeon,35j0lz,BadB0ii,1 point,Sun May 10 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"That got me a couple of times as well in Shattered. I figured it out by accident.   Actually, those are the small differences which make the game so enjoyable, it's like starting fresh."
PixelDungeon,35gpti,aushack,1 point,Sun May 10 04:38:15 2015 UTC,Looks like an interesting mod! How is this compared to Shattered?
PixelDungeon,35gpti,Ryuuki,2,Sun May 10 05:16:24 2015 UTC,"I've won original probably 100 times but shattered only twice, and skillful twice as well. So probably not the best to advise. I prefer skillful over shattered."
PixelDungeon,35gpti,Scharnvirk,2,Sun May 10 08:55:10 2015 UTC,"I tried it few times, but I find it badly unbalanced. Huntress was so weak she couldn't use even starting armor and dagger. Then there are items which are absurd in the other way, like ""dual swords"" which are supposedly a tier-1 weapon which easily outdamage normal tier-3 weapons.... and so on."
PixelDungeon,35gpti,BilbolDev,1 point,Sun May 10 09:18:25 2015 UTC,Nice :)  You don't have to drop the bow since you can't use its slot for anything but a bow :(
PixelDungeon,35gpti,gohjohn,2,Sun May 10 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I noticed. But I think I lost it anyways, probably triggering a trap."
PixelDungeon,35ezwk,ordinary_passerby,5,Sat May 9 18:32:49 2015 UTC,Am i invited?  Edit: I'll bring some potions of vodka
PixelDungeon,35ezwk,ryanfranke,3,Sat May 9 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"You lucky sonuvabitch, how did you get that axe??"
PixelDungeon,35gv2g,accountsoicanupvote,3,Sun May 10 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, potion drops from fly swarms are capped at level 11. So... In other words, you really can't go home again."
PixelDungeon,35gv2g,Haunted_Octopus,1 point,Sun May 10 17:35:07 2015 UTC,Ok next time I have a good run I'll try to do my potion farming before I fight tengu.
PixelDungeon,35gv2g,i_must_work_harder,2,Sun May 10 18:55:41 2015 UTC,There's a table that shows the optimal level to depth ratio to farm at. Drops and monster instance reduce when you're overleveled for a depth. Check the wiki.
PixelDungeon,35gv2g,SGAdventures,1 point,Sun May 10 06:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is a level cap for everything like that. Experience, item drops, hp regen for warlock etc. For the Flies the max levels are 10 for xp and 12 for item drop. once you exceed that they are essentially useless to you :)  http://pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/Swarm_of_flies"
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,ybarrarubio,6,Sat May 9 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"If you have an attack wand, use it to shoot wraiths. If not, retreat behind a door. When the wraith opens the door, hit it and it will die."
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,CoolJoe16,4,Sat May 9 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"Wraiths are extremely evasive and can usually only be hit by sneak attacks which you can do if you go through a doorway and a wraith opens the door. Then you attack and it'll be a sneak attack which is a guaranteed hit on anything.   For the Fetid Rat you should fight it on water to avoid the caustic damage, if you have a seed of earth root than you can plant it and step into it to get a huge defense increase for about 10-15 turns."
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,KingRufus01,1 point,Sun May 10 00:17:41 2015 UTC,I'll take a note on that. The wraiths that get me are the ones that spawn from statues or tombs and surround you from 3 different sides.
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,aushack,3,Sun May 10 00:36:40 2015 UTC,"Open the tombs from a location against a wall or statue or both. In the right spot, you can open a tomb and only get 1 or 2 wraiths instead of 4. But to be honest, I just open the tomb and run for a door ignoring their damage, to surprise attack with other doors ready to hide behind. Or use a wand - lightning will kill them all with a single cast usually (but slightly damage you)."
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,sheix,3,Sun May 10 10:24:04 2015 UTC,"Also, if feeling low on hit points and healing potions and tomb doesn't have a wall corner near it - just don't go there, sometimes it's just not worth it."
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,ryanfranke,2,Sun May 10 10:44:26 2015 UTC,"Hey! That's a great tip! I'll try it the next time, thank you :D"
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,Heavy_Lobster,2,Sun May 10 16:28:50 2015 UTC,"As well as what /u/cooljoe16 said, you can also throw potions at them such as poisonous gas or paralytic gas. Potions of liquid flame are effective in a graveyard with vegetation."
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,SGAdventures,1 point,Sat May 9 21:03:46 2015 UTC,And I just got killed by wraiths again... Hahahahaha thnx for the tips guys
PixelDungeon,35f8sn,Poiuy2010_2011,2,Sat May 9 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"The fetid rat has a permanent paralyzing gas effect around it.  If you fight it without moving, the gas will spread to you and you'll be paralyzed.  The trick is to hit it once or twice, step back, and then hit it again.  If stepping back means moving away from water, then it's better to step back.  Taking 1-2 more damage a turn is better than being paralyzed."
PixelDungeon,35cj3c,postingaccount243,2,Sat May 9 00:12:30 2015 UTC,"According to my calculations, the dew in this room could fill exactly 1.2 dew vials."

PixelDungeon,35cj3c,howard_dean_YEARGH,1 point,Sat May 9 04:12:22 2015 UTC,I have yet to find one ring of herbalism in my 150+ games...
PixelDungeon,35cj3c,ryanfranke,2,Sat May 9 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"Lol, I find them quite often. You should pray to RNGesus more often."
PixelDungeon,35cj3c,howard_dean_YEARGH,2,Sat May 9 01:15:02 2015 UTC,Are you playing shattered PD? They replaced that ring with the sandals of herbalism or whatever.
PixelDungeon,35ds00,concunsion,1 point,Sat May 9 10:07:54 2015 UTC,I have checked the above floor but there are no empty pits to fall into EDIT: I found a piranha room with a key to unlock one but can't seem to find another. Should move on to the next floor?
PixelDungeon,35ds00,Scharnvirk,2,Sat May 9 10:08:49 2015 UTC,Use a mapping scroll. At least one is available in each shop.
PixelDungeon,35ds00,pliop,1 point,Sat May 9 15:51:27 2015 UTC,I've had this exact layout before and had the same problem! I just had to move on...
PixelDungeon,35ds00,NCOSRane,1 point,Sat May 9 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"Go back to floor 6 and buy a magic mapping scroll. Two if the shop has two. Use one on 7. If it's a dry well room, also use one on 6.  You can also grind mapping scrolls from gnoll shaman if you're lucky.  Or do it the old fashioned way. Actually take the time to search every wall on 7, and if that doesn't pan out, do the same thing on 6."
PixelDungeon,35ds00,detoursahead,1 point,Sun May 10 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Had this same problem recently. Took the time to search every single spot looking for the hidden door, but failed to ever find one. Ended up just moving on cause I'm under the impression that this level set up is missing a key or something.   Edit: Figured it out, just gotta go one floor up and find the open chasm room. Fall down(make sure to have decent health since it's gonna hurt) and you will be on the other side of the locked door. You can then get whatever items are there, and pick up the key to let you out!  Happy hunting friends!"
PixelDungeon,35c6ud,michaelxmoney,1 point,Fri May 8 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"Got the same but with flies and a scout. Atleast in my case I could kill them eventually...   Atleast it's not affection, cuz then that would royally suck as you would be stuck and can't even try to  hit :)"
PixelDungeon,35c6ud,BilbolDev,1 point,Sat May 9 05:37:16 2015 UTC,Eventually managed to escape. Eventually....
PixelDungeon,35c6ud,Punkndrublic,1 point,Sat May 9 06:04:32 2015 UTC,I got cornered by flies with an armor of affection. I had to reset.

PixelDungeon,35banl,frostfall_,3,Fri May 8 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"Wow! I wonder if that's a record...  Incidentally, I've actually tweaked some of the mob spawning logic in the coming update (soon, I promise) to prevent ridiculous clumps of mobs like this."
PixelDungeon,35banl,00-Evan,4,Fri May 8 18:06:05 2015 UTC,Its all part of the game. Any true PD player knows that.
PixelDungeon,35banl,Concani,4,Fri May 8 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"well.. yes and no.  Variance is extremely important to PD, and I don't plan to remove it, but things like opening a door into 4-5 crabs on floor 3, or getting a +3 plate from the ghost, are not so fun. Runs should be influenced by variance but not defined by it."
PixelDungeon,35banl,00-Evan,7,Fri May 8 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"Whoah, whoah, whoah. Let's not get hasty.   There is nothing wrong with getting +3 plate from the Sad Ghost ;)   Edit: Thanks for all your hard work and creativity on this game."
PixelDungeon,35banl,Concani,4,Fri May 8 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"Hehe, it certainly doesn't feel like there's a problem with that at the time, but  the game shouldn't have to balance itself to account for RNG of that nature. The lower the variance the more I can jack up the max difficulty without it seeming like the only way to win is to get very lucky."
PixelDungeon,35banl,00-Evan,2,Fri May 8 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the response. It was actually a nice xp bonus, considering the door gave me the opportunity to bottleneck them. Looking forward to the update!"
PixelDungeon,35banl,00-Evan,3,Fri May 8 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"well, you are the warrior after all.  Imagine if the huntress opened that door."
PixelDungeon,35banl,Scharnvirk,2,Fri May 8 18:33:48 2015 UTC,"Heeey!   But I liked those clumps. Makes game fun when it happens, for all that ""AW SHIT"" moments :)"
PixelDungeon,35banl,00-Evan,3,Fri May 8 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"Oh there will still be plenty of those don't worry. I am also considering increasing the chance for a clump at deeper floors. Generally ""Oh shit!' works in the late game, where if the player is doing decently they have more tools to deal with adversity."
PixelDungeon,35banl,Scharnvirk,2,Fri May 8 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"Nice, that's good!  Btw, I'd like to ask you (again :D) for doing something with dwarven monks. If not toning their incredibly annoying skill down, then at least try implementing auto-pickup the dropped weapon without it going to the inventory..."
PixelDungeon,35banl,00-Evan,3,Fri May 8 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"I'm still going to do one set of floors at a time (hopefully speeding up on it too), and when I get to floors 21-25 monks are probably going to get completely reworked. I may do a smaller tweak in the meantime to reduce the annoyance factor, we'll see."

PixelDungeon,35bf2q,Concani,8,Fri May 8 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"I generally save up my stylii and use them all at once on my endgame armor, attempting to get a semi-beneficial enchantment.  Glyphs should generally better service strategic niches, and not have such harsh downsides, but i do like the concept of them not being a strict buff."
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,00-Evan,2,Fri May 8 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"I do exactly this. I'll keep metabolism, viscosity, or entanglement on any class. Affection on a sniper or mage. Anti-entropy is stupid. I'll burn upgrade scrolls just to get rid of that one. Anything else is pretty benign. Not the glyph I want, but not too crippling. Oh, displacement. I run from that one like the plague. Sure, teleport me away from ranged attackers. That's not crappy at all."
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,NCOSRane,3,Sun May 10 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"I use them whenever I have at least two. The chance for getting two totally unacceptable ""upgrades"" like anti-entropy is slim and after all this is an equivalent of 1-scroll worth of upgrade.  Most of the glyphs are very average and don't harm or help too much so it is worth it.  If I have too many things in the backpack though, arcane stylis are the first thing which goes."
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,Scharnvirk,2,Fri May 8 19:04:54 2015 UTC,Anti entropy is great against monks and fire elementals by the way. Very useful.
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,aushack,2,Sun May 10 15:11:18 2015 UTC,Some of the glyphs are pretty nice tho. First that come to mind now are multiplicity and metabolism. Some are really annoying indeed.
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,HeyYouMad,2,Fri May 8 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"Don't use them. I love the concept of randomized effects, but all of them are terrible. You should be able to use them on weapons too, but some exclusive downsides"
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,ryanfranke,2,Sun May 10 01:01:19 2015 UTC,Yeah i do the same. Why are all armor enchantments terrible?  You want to get set on fire randomly? You want to get rooted to the ground? Lets pop a toxic potion directly on you randomly. Didnt you want to get teleported away from the goo?
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,TacoSauce,6,Fri May 8 18:36:55 2015 UTC,Being rooted also means being almost invulnerable. I like this one.
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,Scharnvirk,1 point,Fri May 8 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"Not if you're fighting the gnoll trickster, gnoll shaman, dwarf warlock, scorpion, or evil eye though.   And that's like half the game."
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,Scharnvirk,1 point,Fri May 8 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"Being hit by a ranged weapon is a mistake itself. 99% of ranged enemies which try to attack me get dragged into nearest doorway to be cut to pieces with whatever melee weapon I have at hand. The trickster and scorpions are slightly more complicated, but first is rare and for second you can change the glyph in advance.   Or do what most players do, skip demon halls."
PixelDungeon,35bf2q,follier,2,Fri May 8 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"They aren't terrible they just change your play style or depend on your character.   Sniper + Affection = Win, for example."
PixelDungeon,359u5l,NYRDS,2,Fri May 8 08:58:42 2015 UTC,Might want to open up elf as a playable character from the start. An awful lot of people won't be working their way down to the dwarf king to see if the elf is any fun.
PixelDungeon,359u5l,Stencile,1 point,Fri May 8 16:25:11 2015 UTC,The 9 strength on the Elf is a bit sad :(. Any real reason for it? unless the bow bonus is REALLY big for elves  What does the brew option do o.o?
PixelDungeon,359u5l,BilbolDev,1 point,Fri May 8 10:26:06 2015 UTC,"The bow is pretty awesome early on. Finding enough arrows becomes difficult later. I  beat Tengu my first try with an elf. The specializations for the class are interestin sounding. I've picked one, stopped playing for the day on floor 11 though."
PixelDungeon,359u5l,Punkndrublic,1 point,Fri May 8 11:32:35 2015 UTC,I was referring to any Elf bonus to justify the strength penalty.. having 9 strength means longer time for better gear
PixelDungeon,359u5l,BilbolDev,1 point,Fri May 8 15:50:18 2015 UTC,Well they are pretty fast...
PixelDungeon,359u5l,Punkndrublic,1 point,Fri May 8 16:32:55 2015 UTC,"Elves supposed to be hardcore and unusual class.  Yes you can apply some potions to some items to get some new effects... ( not so much combinations for now, but will be more )"

PixelDungeon,357vwh,Undust4able,2,Thu May 7 21:03:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion! We do get a lot of posts around this sub asking for more or less the same thing, (where's the key?, shattered vs vanilla, etc.) and I can understand the sentiment of wanting to just make a bot handle the brunt of the work of responding to these topics. However, these kinds of posts do not really pop up frequently enough to warrant setting up a bot, especially when you consider that it might bring its own glitches and problems to the table. We are still discussing possible subreddit changes based on ideas from the last modpost, so we will consider it"
PixelDungeon,3563wr,ColeLogic,6,Thu May 7 12:41:10 2015 UTC,OK.got to the end boss... Was going good then I miss clicked. Got into the paralysis gas and burning fist smashed me 2 times and killed me. Rip my best run
PixelDungeon,3563wr,calilove510,3,Thu May 7 13:22:23 2015 UTC,I usually hold a few until I see what the imp ring is then I'd likely dump the rest on the armor and slowness wand (slowness OP).  That's plenty of hammer and you get double benefit on armor upgrades with rougue (i.e. dodge bonus).
PixelDungeon,3563wr,calilove510,3,Thu May 7 14:30:28 2015 UTC,I died so

PixelDungeon,3563wr,Monorail5,2,Thu May 7 16:49:52 2015 UTC,"Is this shattered? If yes, I'd say armor. Your hammer is too good to risk disenchantment."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,dachhack,5,Thu May 7 12:20:06 2015 UTC,Anyway to get a precompiled apk?
PixelDungeon,3561zu,SoylentGreenMuffins,2,Thu May 7 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"I really like the bigger level grid.  My first floor had a chasm room that dropped me into a room with a dry well and no doors.  Luckily, the dead body in there had a teleport scroll.  I don't know if I got lucky or if that's how you designed (some of) the drop rooms, rather than having a locked door, so I thought I'd throw that out there."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 7 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"Got my first death against Goo. That upgraded Goo is unreal. It also hurt that I was using a stunning spear I Found on a statue.  Something seemed up with the stunning enchantment. Sometimes, I would see the text saying I paralyzed something when I hit it, but it would still take a hit on me or not be paralyzed at all. This might have just been because the weapon was a spear, so the monster recovered before I got my next hit in.  Maybe blandfruit should be able to go into the seed pouch? Since nuts and berries can go in there, and those are technically fruit. Those berries saved my bacon a couple of times. Do they make sungrass seeds redundant?  If you're lucky, you can use the dew vial to fill itself with the water function. Maybe I just got lucky with dewdrops, but if that's a possible exploit, I wanted to throw it out there."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 7 16:33:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll check the stunning enhancement.  I'd be worried about the pouch not having enough room for everything. I'll count it up and see if that's possible.  Good point about the berries. They do make the sungrass seeds redundant if you use them for rest/regen boost. They have different uses though as the berry regen travels with you and only lasts for limited turns. Allows you to save sungrass for potion cooking as well.  WATER from the Dew Vial is an intended exploit. It's a scary dungeon out there; Dew Vial is your new best friend.  Thanks for testing!
PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 7 16:44:42 2015 UTC,"I think stunning has a chance for a duration of zero (or the monsters all have some innate resistance - you made them all stronger, so they might).  It doesn't seem to vary monster to monster. Just sometimes, when stunned, I see the paralyzed text and they keep right on moving. Sometimes they're actually stunned.  So I can seriously just keep watering the lawn all day and randomly upgrading my gear for 30 dewdrops? Is bless supposed to upgrade your things for you?  Food only heals the warrior in your version, right? Because there's an endless supply of monster meat. You ought to have some campfire gear somewhere in the dungeon to cook it all, but even raw, I'm sitting on lots of healing."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,jyjjy,1 point,Thu May 7 21:41:17 2015 UTC,dew bless is limited based on how deep you've gone. Firetraps are now your other best friend.
PixelDungeon,3561zu,jyjjy,1 point,Thu May 7 23:24:22 2015 UTC,I'd think fire seeds/potions as they can cook all your meat and a trap only 2. Can it still be frozen?
PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri May 8 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, can still be frozen. I like to plop all burnables on a grassy spot next to a fire trap then throw something to set the trap off and burn the grassy square."

PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri May 8 01:28:42 2015 UTC,"Something strange happened at the troll blacksmith. I gave him my plate armor (I think it was +6 or 7, stench enchantment) plus a set of +3 plate, and the app crashed. But when I reopened it, I had a set of +8 plate.  I rage quit at the DM/printer boss. I'm sitting on a +9 stunning/lightened shortsword, +8 plate, +7 firebolt wand (slash meat cooker), piles of meat, berries, two blessed ankhs, healing and mending potions. And I'm getting my ass handed to me.  You might consider expanding shops -- putting lots and lots of groceries in there. Due to the huge level grids, you have more than enough to buy out the entire shop when you get there, and still have thousands left over."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri May 8 13:24:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'll check into the crash but the blacksmith upgrade sounds about right. I tried to tweak it so that the first item is sacrificed to add upgrades to the second. Items don't have to be of the same class. The first + from the sacrificed item adds to the other item, then all subsequent +'s get added at increasingly lower probabilities. You can increase the probability of subsequent +'s being transferred by having more dark gold in your pack when complete the quest.   Sorry about the rage quit... You will likely have your ass handed to you by DM300 if you don't knock out the printers first. The dew vial is your friend..."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri May 8 13:40:11 2015 UTC,"That thing is like Yog, but instead of one larva, he spawns four evil eyes, with double the armor and hp of regular evil eyes!  On my next run, I might opt for a heavier weapon. I stuck with the shortsword since I got a lucky stunning enchantment, which is great for one-on-one combat in a doorway as a gladiator. Not so great in a huge open room with swarms of ranged, armor-ignoring attackers that you need to take out fast."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,Ryuuki,1 point,Fri May 8 13:43:06 2015 UTC,That's a good plan. You need to find and put down the printers ASAP on that boss.
PixelDungeon,3561zu,HuhDude,1 point,Fri May 8 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"Another funny thing. When I blast wraiths with my firebolt wand, I get a message that the attack passes through the wraith (though the wraith is still hit and dies)."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,HuhDude,1 point,Fri May 8 14:14:58 2015 UTC,"The troll blacksmith crashed again for me. That's 2 for 2.  Definitely a thing.  This time, I had a +6 ring of furor I tried to reforge with a +1 ring of furor.  The game crashed.  When I restarted, I had one +4 ring.  Screw you troll.  If it affects the math at all, I put the +1 ring on the left.  Maybe tweak the coding to always treat the highest plus as the benefactor and the lowest as the sacrificed item.  Also, after I killed a bat with the pickaxe, the blacksmith never took the pickaxe back.  But he gave me the quest reward all the same.  I still managed to smash the DM and his printers.  I'm an assassin this time around.  (Is every hit on a printer supposed to count as a surprise attack?)  I think the dew vial and splash completely replace the rogue cloak.  They do the same thing (invis), only better (haste, too), with a longer duration, without the cooldown (you can do it ten times in a row), and arguably charge back up again faster (it's easier to water and restock on dew than it is to wait for your cloak to charge up.)  That fight was hard.  I'm afraid of what that Dwarf King is going to be like.  Do enchantments not go away in your mod? I've upgraded enchanted gear quite a bit without losing them. Of note, I used a few magical infusion scrolls on my armor, and it changed the enchantment every time. Using it on my weapon didn't. Obviously, I've been triggering those gravestones to spawn 4 wraiths at a time intentionally.  I was serious about one of my earlier suggestions about just creating a giant grocery store.  The thief armband is a pretty useless artifact when you have 15k gold every time you reach a shop just by virtue of walking through five floors, and you can just buy out the entire place.  In fact, might as well just leave junk you don't want on the ground and not worry about selling it.  What's 80 gold for a random scale armor you find when you're carrying over 10k?  I'd put a trap door that leads to a shop that has its entire own floor and just line the shelves with overpriced crap.  Don't know what you might want to do about this, but since you get experience every time something dies, you can stand around on a floor with broken robots, like level 14, and just get experience as they blow up while you refill your dew or something. I gained a level or two just walking around cleaning out the floor from robots blowing up."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue May 12 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"Ha. I'll see if I can fix the grumpy troll.  I changed it so that you can keep the pickaxe. Hoping to add more digging and other stuff to do with that tool.  Should be the item on the left gains upgrades from the item on the right.  You get the first 2 upgrades transferred at 100% chance. The next upgrade is at 50% plus 5% for each piece of dark gold you've mined. The next upgrade after that is at 10% decreased probability, the next is at 20% decreased probability, and so on with a floor of 50% probability.   Did you have any dark gold mined when you finished the quest? I can see that I didn't account for null values in the code."
PixelDungeon,3561zu,SuperChiantos,1 point,Tue May 12 19:37:25 2015 UTC,No gold mined. I got the bat-killing quest instead.
PixelDungeon,3561zu,people_with_hats,1 point,Tue May 12 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"Another cool thing: When the game crashes for you, it doesn't count the troll quest as spent.   So I was able to combine my furor ring with a +1 evasion ring to get it upgraded.  It crashed again, and I don't have any more things to combine, but I think I could keep doing this.    So you think if I mine some dark gold, getting rid of the zero in the math, that will avoid the crash and let the reward get spent normally?"
PixelDungeon,3561zu,lnxr0x,1 point,Tue May 12 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Enchantments don't erase on weapon upgrade. Enchanting a weapon again should add a new enchantment so that's definitely a bug I will have to fix. I used to just skip graves all the time. I like that there is now a pretty major incentive to release and hunt down the wraiths.  I would like to overhaul the shops at some point. Maybe balancing the gold so that you can just afford most of the stuff you want from the shop would be an easy fix right now.   I was thinking of adding a ""It's a secret to everybody."" room (from Zelda) somewhere in the dungeon. You'd have to burn a patch of grass or something to find stairs to it. Could have unique/buffed items for sale in there.   Good point on the robots. I thought it was kinda cool to hear malfunction! and explosions in the distance without actually seeing the robots but it might be better to only have them malfunction when the hero is in view."

PixelDungeon,3551ro,Morleen,1 point,Thu May 7 04:29:19 2015 UTC,"It's usually capped by about half the floor depth so if you leave your +8 glaive on floor 5 it will be +3, if you leave it behind on floor 10 it will be +6. It won't add upgrades, just takes away.  Also there is no guarantee you will get the glaive, if it randomly picks another gear slot that has nothing equipped, you just get some of the gold."
PixelDungeon,3551ro,SGAdventures,1 point,Thu May 7 04:39:41 2015 UTC,There's only a 1 in 4 chance that it will drop the weapon. You are better off using the hero remains to try dropping a tonne of warrior short swords to upgrade the weapon with :)
PixelDungeon,3551ro,gohjohn,1 point,Thu May 7 04:42:16 2015 UTC,Actually I have tried that before.. Spent at least an hour or two just to get a good start.. Not really worth it.
PixelDungeon,3551ro,SGAdventures,1 point,Thu May 7 06:46:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't do it every level. More useful for giving yourself a ring of shadows or a boomerang on the first couple of depths :)
PixelDungeon,3551ro,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu May 7 06:52:33 2015 UTC,"This doesn't work. Heroes remains pick one of your four slots and contain that one item. If the slot is empty, the remains contain gold instead.  So if you kill off your hero with his +8 glaive, you'd only have a 1/4 chance of the remains actually containing it.  Further, the loot from remains is capped based on the depth where you find it. So that +8 glaive you drop on floor 1 will be +1.  But to my knowledge, the hero's remains are always there, on whatever floor you died. If you died on floor 1, they ought to be pretty easy to find since there aren't any secret doors on floor 1. Maybe they don't always appear."
PixelDungeon,351lh1,TheSilverSpiral,12,Wed May 6 10:22:44 2015 UTC,Did you check on floor 1 for a room with a pit? Sometimes you will have to fall into the open pit in order to get into the locked room below

PixelDungeon,34xybz,ordinary_passerby,3,Tue May 5 14:12:46 2015 UTC,Snipers are my favorite class. Gimme a boomerang and a blink wand and I'll move the earth.
PixelDungeon,34xybz,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue May 5 14:44:33 2015 UTC,I've always wondered if upgrading your boomerang was a viable strategy.  You know how much damage it did with +8?
PixelDungeon,34xybz,lbrol,2,Tue May 5 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the numbers, but they're not shabby.  If you manage to get a nice chilling, eldritch, or stunning enchantment on your boomerang, that makes a big difference.  A highly upgraded boomerang also pairs well with a melee weapon that has one of those enchantments, or a slow wand or blink wand. Or a ring of haste. But even without those things, a +8 boomerang does some decent damage (especially with the added blazing enchantment. Venomous and lucky aren't terrible either. Unstable is fun. Grim is super fun.) Don't forget that snipers do bonus strength damage using their boomerang. And get the sniper's mark buff to attack faster with it.  Even if you cant make distance from a bad guy, you've really softened him up by the time he reaches you. And while you take a hit to your accuracy, you can still throw that boomerang from melee range if you want to (accuracy rings pair well with boomerangs regardless). That's not an awful thing to do for snipers since they get their sniper's mark buff for faster attacks. And the door thing works with boomerangs, too, no matter whether you're right next to the bad guy."
PixelDungeon,34xybz,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue May 5 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"A pretty decent amount. I haven't done a Sniper run in a while, but I was usually able to kill things with 3-4 hits, as long as they didn't get in melee range."
PixelDungeon,34x3pb,TrillTrill,1 point,Tue May 5 07:46:43 2015 UTC,"I have never gotten that ring, so I can't help you in that aspect. And yeah, I don't like darts or any other ranged weapon usually when I'm a sniper.  What the zero-ed in buff does is that it doubles the speed of your next shot.  My sniper builds are usually a few points in ranged, a few points in armour and a few points in a good weapon. Because of my build, I usually find boomerang abit lacking in close combat because of the lower accuracy when near.. Hence I usually melee them down (try to surprise attack as much as possible).  Although, I heard that many people have success with a crazily upgraded boomerang (but I haven't tried), so you can try that route too.  Regardless, save on potions of mindvision and paralysis for bosses, and try to speed run the demon halls. Good luck!"
PixelDungeon,34x3pb,gohjohn,1 point,Tue May 5 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"The sharpshooter ring just increases accuracy for sniper. Almost all your upgrades should be going on the boomerang. The wand of slowness + extra accuracy + sniper bonus + balanced for speed for extra hits and bonuses + an enchantment later on... you should have no problem. Melee unnecessary. Don't be a pussy and speed run the demon halls, own that shit."

But because this is 1-move-multiple-turns game, we can't figure out how to implement a turn based system in multiplayer.  One solution I just thought of is to have 2 games run simultaneously perhaps? And somehow the games can interact with each other. To implement this might be possible with say... Bluetooth.. Hmmmm, have to think about this more.  As for easier difficulty, I think a few mods have done this. Skillful dungeon and easymode mod (links in sidebar ---->)"

PixelDungeon,34vjis,00-Evan,3,Tue May 5 04:56:13 2015 UTC,"Questions about multiplayer are fairly common, and I feel like the possibility for success all depends on how you define multiplayer. If you mean a traditional, two or more players in the same environment, then I think the answer is maybe, probably not. Aside from the technical challenges, the turn-based nature of the game will become much more pronounced and awkward with the game waiting for input from two people. It may still work, but there are very severe technical and design hurdles to overcome first.  I'd feel much more confident about saying yes if we're talking about two separate game sessions interacting in ways, that sort of thing is much more feasible."
PixelDungeon,34vjis,BilbolDev,1 point,Tue May 5 12:53:27 2015 UTC,"Well... the only plausible way in mind is basically three multilayer game modes   Head vs Head, basically two games that start at the same time and whoever beats the game first (or max depth if both end up dieing) win Cooperative, you can trade items. That's pretty much it. Some items cannot be traded, such as unique items and strength potions. Custom games where the wacky game play is acceptable. Like 1 vs 1, or two players vs a boss.   That's pretty much it, you can't have regular game play as multiplier unfortunately."
PixelDungeon,34vjis,00-Evan,2,Tue May 5 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"Well you can, but it'll be clunky. Lots of logic would need to be rewritten to accommodate two players and the turn based nature of the game would make it akward, but it would be technically possible.  I do however completely agree that from a design perspective the current dungeon doesn't really work with multiplayer. If I were to ever add a cooperative mode to the game it would be in a separate or reworked dungeon, as a lot of things would need to work differently to allow, and take advantage of two players."

But I've been playing this game for about a year and I only just had my first win on Shattered as the Warrior. I've made it very close many other times but usually it came down to either bad luck (of course) or me doing something stupid that I KNEW  that I should not have done.   Eventually you will get your win. And it is going to feel gooooooooooood.
PixelDungeon,34nhzl,JoeLithium,5,Sun May 3 01:46:12 2015 UTC,yeah hopefully I get there soon xD but I have no clue what you're talking about   Thanks!

PixelDungeon,34nhzl,aushack,3,Sat May 2 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"You should reach L5 Goo easily. The fact you're not means you're making mistakes. Don't equip any weapon or armour that is too heavy for your strength rating. Open doors, press the bottom left sleep button until the monsters see you (or throw a dart at them). Then walk out of the room behind the door, and press the sleep button a few times until the monster comes to get you. When it opens the door it is a surprise attack with guaranteed hit and extra damage. Do this to all rooms if you can. If there are queues of monsters in that room, retreat to other doors you've already been past and repeat the process. Also, play until your health is about 50% then find a door and long press the sleep button to actually fall asleep, which gives you full health. Because you're sleeping next to a door, if a monster enters he will wake you and you can still hit him with the surprise guaranteed hit attack. Then close the door and sleep again. You don't need any scrolls until level 6 really. You should not need potions either, unless you find yourself with no health and surrounded by crabs. In that case, take a guess and drink a potion you have 2 or more of. If you're lucky it will be health and you live, otherwise you died but just try again. I've been to L10 before without needing any health potions, just food and sleep. Also, to not pick up dew drops. Wait until you have the dew vial, and wait until you're health is full and not hungry then collect them in the dew vial. The only time I pick up dew for health rather than vial collection is L21+"
PixelDungeon,34nhzl,friendlyfire,3,Sun May 3 01:59:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't even know I could sleep, very useful to know thanks !  I just managed to get to the goo on my last run after reading part of the guide, but it destroyed me :(  I try to bait monsters around a corner to get the first hit, does that count as a surprise attack ?  I normally immediately drink potions/read scrolls when I get them and I never equip stuff that needs a higher strength rating. I'll try not consuming anything."
PixelDungeon,34nhzl,aushack,2,Sun May 3 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"When fighting Goo, always use the brown armour seed on water and keep Goo on land.  Surprise attack only works via doors, or where the straight path bends 1 square then back again. If you have a throwing weapon and you open a door and they're sleeping,you can also surprise attack. A too heavy object like a javelin is great for that first hit.  On the first 3 levels, there is almost 100% chance for 2 each of strength potion and upgrade scroll. You don't want to waste health potions, or use upgrade scrolls until you have tier 4/5 weapon or armour. So don't read scrolls for fun. If you are warrior you know what is a strength potion. For others, you might have to guess. If doing so, stand on water or throw scrolls in water first. If there is a blocked path by vines / books, stand next to the blockage and drink a potion. If you catch fire then walk to water or use a blue frost seed. The alternative is to catch on fire without burning the blocked way, which might contain awesome treasures. If there is fish on a level, a potion will always be invisibility. Or the chasm/drop, always levitation. So you can make a guess for those floors and hope for the best. But yeah, don't drink potions unless you need to (every health potion can count on a unforgiving run, so try not to find a health until L5+)."

PixelDungeon,34nhzl,Pinetarball,2,Wed May 6 08:11:39 2015 UTC,"The Pixel Dungeon Wiki is what changed me from being just like you into a decent player (I've at least managed to beat the 3rd boss a couple times).  http://pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_guide  The key strategies are:    Always level up at least 1 level higher than the next stage. So reach level 2 on stage 1, 3 on stage 2, etc. You should be at least level 6 before you fight Boo, but chances are you will reach at least level 7 or 8 if you take your time on stages 3 & 4.  Always rely on surprise attacks and never let a monster get the first hit on you. I usually let monsters approach me instead of approaching them and I let them chase me out of doors so I can hit them with guaranteed 100% accuracy at least once. This even works on wraiths.  Don't eat unless you really need to. If you can travel around while starving and keep your health up with dew drops, you don't need to eat. Food is scarce so only use it when you can heal up fully. What I do is wait until I'm starving & almost dead, go into a room where monsters are unlikely to find me (this is especially easy on boss stages) throw a seed of sungrass, eat, step on the seed and sleep (hold the wait button until your character falls asleep). This will refill my health very quickly. Otherwise you can still sleep to restore health but you will probably be hungry again by the time it refills.  When you get good at defeating them, farm some health potions from flies / bats and money from gnolls. Learn to fight with seeds, potions and other special items. If you find a honeypot then that will give you a huge advantage against Boo. I also like to use fire items, bombs and poison items against him. Wand of Blink is very useful against Tengu, since he's less dangerous at close range, and seed of dreamweed is amazing against DM-300, because he will wander around aimlessly while you can hit him with any ranged attacks you have. But the most important thing is to build up your armor / evade to the point where their attacks are unlikely to harm you. If you are taking a lot of damage then you should go back to easier floors and level up.  Once you beat Goo the first time you'll get the Tome which will let you play as a gladiator or berserker. This makes subsequent runs as warrior a little easier."

PixelDungeon,34m61i,HOLD-SHIFT,3,Sat May 2 16:37:25 2015 UTC,One of the subclasses for the mage. IIRC you can wield wands as melee weapons and get a charge for every melee attack you make with whichever wand you are wielding.
PixelDungeon,34m61i,roflkaapter,3,Sat May 2 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"It is one of two ""advanced"" classes you can pick once you have the training manual.  While all wizards can equip a wand as a melee weapon, battlemages gain a charge on the wand for each hit landed."

They just give you less hp, give the monsters more, and make the monsters do more damage, while nerfing healing potions. So when you die, it's not because you messed up, were stingy with items, didn't prepare, etc. You die because you opened a door, saw a 20 hp marsupial rat, and he did more than 12 points of damage to you before you could kill him because random number generator.

But some how, the game is a breeze with Warrior. I beat Shattered on my first real run of it ever, along with a victory on vanilla before I accidentally reset, plus one run that I beat super easy and came back to depth one and committed suicide, plus the 7 victories on my leaderboards. The game is cake. If I really tried, I could beat it at least once a day. But for the life of me, I can barely get out sewers with any other class.   I made a post about it a while back, but it didn't really get any attention. I'm considering making a new post, but I haven't really bothered to find the time."
PixelDungeon,34k2tw,Anonemuss42,1 point,Sat May 2 23:38:30 2015 UTC,I love the knuckleduster! Only weapon monks can't knock out and it's just tons of fun to combo with it. Getting a good 3-4 hits off.
PixelDungeon,34k2tw,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri May 1 21:44:29 2015 UTC,"Warriors aren't so great. They have an easier time with depths 1-5 because they start out with a better weapon than anyone else and get an extra point of strength. And I guess because food heals them 5 hp.  Toward the end of the game, 5 hp is nothing. Once you have enough strength to wield a tier-5 weapon and wear plate armor, an extra strength point is just a little bit of gravy. That shortsword is replaced by the first good weapon you find, then you have to lug it around until you're ready to sacrifice it for an enchant-safe upgrade.  If you're a gladiator, later in the game, enemies block your hits pretty regularly. Racking up long combos will be rare.  If you're a berserker, you eventually get to the depths where staying at 40% health just isn't safe.  End-game, assassins and both mage subclasses are way stronger than warriors."
PixelDungeon,34k2tw,NCOSRane,0,Fri May 1 22:30:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sure these are valid opinions, but I don't see the point in arguing against the idea that Warrior is any good. This is sort of the wrong thread to debate the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness, according to you) of Warrior. When a person puts up a post talking about having won the game about 9 times, all with Warrior, it seems like that'd be good evidence that at least for some people, Warrior is a very good class. And trust me, I understand I'm no good with anything else."

PixelDungeon,34f33q,Morleen,2,Thu Apr 30 21:50:22 2015 UTC,"No, you have to hope yog is in a corner and hope the fists don't notice you while taking constant damage from larva, and sometimes the fists, and hope you have earthroot seeds and way too much armor and health potions. Way easier than killing both fists(one at a time if you have any seeds/potions saved up) and taking zero damage from larva since you kill them as they spawn. Also it's impossible to kill any monsters in 22-24 so don't ever try you will die instantly just for considering it."

PixelDungeon,34f33q,NCOSRane,1 point,Fri May 1 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"Yog takes something like 25% of your regular damage if both fists are alive. You're going to be sitting there getting chewed on by larvae forever since every hit at that reduced damage spawns another one. That chews through healing potions far faster (including the few you burn running around getting shot by the burning hand trying to get yourself set up) versus just taking out the fists.  Paralytic gas and frost potions work on the fists. A favorite tactic of many is to drink a mind vision to spot where the hands are, toss a paralytic gas potion, then toss a toxic gas potion. If you have enough of those potions saved up, you could even kill them that way, but at the very least, you'll soften them up good. A frost potion is great for freezing one of them while you fight the other.  The green hand goes down quickly if you're a sniper or mage, but if you want to fight him the old fashioned way at melee range, that's where you'd use earthroot and stand in water while you fight. If the burning hand is still around, try to get both hands in melee range so it won't shoot at you.  Once you're in melee range of the burning hand, it barely does any damage at all. Just fire. (That fire actually hurts the green hand if you get them both close to each other).  With both hands dead, Yog takes full damage, and just sits there for your abuse. So you can hit him once, kill that one larva, and repeat until you're done.  In the hundreds of times I've made it to Yog, I think I might have died against him twice. He's dinky compared to the other bosses."

PixelDungeon,34bh3t,callmeWia,7,Wed Apr 29 23:09:45 2015 UTC,Skillful is a good Addition! Its really cool with the skills! And then its really entertaining to read the monsters dialogue when they die! Theres so much content! Plus! Theres Bows and arrows!  Im just going to play remix later. It sounds really Promising  What can i say about Ripped? It can be a good Mod. But its underdeveloped :( the person who made it is inactive at this subreddit.  Shattered. Is well Balanced. Has just the right Ingredients for a Minimalistic but entertaining game. Content is always varied and the Evan is always in touch with the community.  Ill Download the other mods too later
PixelDungeon,34bh3t,callmeWia,3,Wed Apr 29 23:18:29 2015 UTC,Great summary! I've never thought you'd answer the question in full cause there's so many mods haha!
PixelDungeon,34bh3t,NCOSRane,3,Wed Apr 29 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"Plus! Theres Bows and arrows!   I don't understand bows. You need two items to use them (but start with both of them). They're better than darts but worse than shuriken. If you're lucky, you might find a frost bow or bomb arrow on a run, but otherwise, they're a pretty piss-poor weapon.  The one class that ought to be a bow-blasting machine also starts with a boomerang. One upgrade, and that boomerang's as good as a bow and arrow. Plus you can enchant your boomerang. One of her passive skills makes a new arrow every so often. I don't think I ever fired one. I stockpiled and sold them for 5 gold each the entire game. I must have had 2000 extra gold after buying out every single shop. I just killed everything with my boomerang. It was +7 blazing, but you don't even have to upgrade it that much. With the passive range and accuracy skills, it just nuked everything. Then a +2 glaive for anything that got close. I still had 30 healing potions after Yog was dead.  I was going somewhere with this...oh yeah. Bows. I don't get it."
PixelDungeon,34bh3t,BilbolDev,3,Thu Apr 30 02:53:35 2015 UTC,The droprate will be reworked in next update. Will become a lot more often. And new types of bows would be added and so. I am trying to make a mini-Diablo out of PD :)
PixelDungeon,34bh3t,NCOSRane,2,Thu Apr 30 07:02:25 2015 UTC,"Take the huntress' boomerang away and replace it with a slightly better starting bow (think something like the warrior's shortsword), and I'd actually put more than that initial point in fletching. And maybe make flame/frost arrow only usable with arrows, as their name implies (I didn't really need to frost-boomerang people, but I did it for fun a lot. I was surprised that you could flame/frost any ranged weapon.)  Then, make bows upgradeable/enchantable, but a tier-1 weapon (like boomerang, so they don't end up with uncontrollably awesome damage, not that they won't anyway due to the passive ranged damage skill).  Then give them some kind of chance of critical hit not found in other ranged weapons. Either inherent to being a bow, a passive skill for huntress that ups the bow critical hit chance, or my personal favorite, an active skill.  Huntress' aren't mages. I'd combine flame/frost arrow into one active skill. Call it ""elemental arrow"" or something. It randomly fires off either flame, frost, or shocking. Then give them a critical shot type skill that randomly affects the target with cripple, bleeding, or extra damage/grim. Or heck, just cripple. I'd go to town if I could cripple monsters and pepper them with arrows while they limp toward me."
PixelDungeon,34bh3t,gohjohn,2,Thu Apr 30 14:29:13 2015 UTC,Yeah its lacking. I think its just a starting item. Or it could have a twist
PixelDungeon,34bh3t,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:22:40 2015 UTC,Bows imo makes the early game easier for all characters. The ranged attack chips away enemies' hp.  I also use it as door openers and test shots.  Have you tried suicide mode with huntress yet? Bows are your friend.
PixelDungeon,34bh3t,Britsman,1 point,Fri May 1 05:13:54 2015 UTC,"A +1 boomerang does as much damage as a bow, and doesn't seem all that less accurate. What's a bow have over the boomerang?  But yeah, for any other class, I just use my 45 arrows to soften up some of the enemies so I eat less damage early on. That's kind of what I do with any ranged weapon anyway (before I find a decent wand). Just toss them all liberally at whatever comes first. If I try to save them up for some future time when I think I'll need them, I'll just never use them. Might as well sell them. If I have a decent wand or an upgraded boomerang and it's unlikely I'll ever use ranged weapons again, I often do."

PixelDungeon,34ce6d,khondrych,2,Thu Apr 30 01:49:01 2015 UTC,"I've missed imp a few times before. His colour is very close to the water in the dwarvern city, so if he's standing in a puddle it camouflages him quite well.  (I also consider his quest to be one of the best because it gives a random +3 ring!)"
PixelDungeon,34ce6d,BadB0ii,2,Thu Apr 30 19:19:40 2015 UTC,Yeah but does so so late in the game that it rarely helps that much. Especially on Shattered where at that point I tend to have artifacts that are maxed out or close to it.

PixelDungeon,34ce6d,BadB0ii,2,Mon May 4 12:40:43 2015 UTC,Yeah you really have to look out for that 'Psst' in the bottom left corner haha. Surprisingly the demon halls are a bit harder without that shop ;)

PixelDungeon,348tmb,SGAdventures,2,Wed Apr 29 05:18:45 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I'm writing this comment as both a member of the community, who wants to see more of this content, and a moderator, who is responsible for keeping the subreddit free of spam. I have some suggestions for you.  So first, the content itself. I really like this video, and we don't have enough of tutorial type videos here. I can see this being very useful for new players and veterans alike. That said, you should target your audience. If you want new players to see this, so they can learn the tips and tricks, I recommend starting with the warrior. Most new players will not have unlocked huntress, let alone gotten the Tome of Mastery to play as warden. If you target veterans, most of them already know the tricks you mention and you should instead focus on overall strategy (what to upgrade? when?). I also recommend you play in landscape mode, it makes for better viewing.  Second, the presentation of the content (this post). Because you are a new redditor, you may not be aware of reddit's rules and our rules here in /r/PixelDungeon. reddit has rules for people who promote their own content on reddit. The main point is that 10% of your posts and comments should be self-promotion, and the remaining should not. At /r/PixelDungeon, we do enforce this rule. This means that if you want to continue promoting your videos here, you should participate in other threads here (or anywhere else on reddit). You can read more about our rules for submitting here (look at Rule 2).  Finally, I recommend avoiding things like ¡NEW! in your title, that will only make redditors see you a spammer. Also avoid posting the same comment on multiple threads, that makes you look like a spammer as well. (Example here.)  I hope this feedback helps you. It may seem like a lot, but following these suggestions will give your content the greatest chance of being noticed by the community. You do have a great video there, and I hope this comment doesn't deter you from posting here. I focused on a lot of the negative aspects, but the video itself is fantastic and I hope to see more of it in the future :)  tl;dr: participate in other threads too, that way you aren't a spammer."
PixelDungeon,348tmb,roastedlasagna,2,Wed Apr 29 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah cheers, Doing the warden first was more inspired by some chats we had on the Wikia about run-throughs. I'm hoping that this first series will be a quick and dirty run through covering a bunch of stuff to essentially to have stuff that anyone of any skill level might find interesting.  Landscape recording is defs useful. I wasn't initially using it because when it came out as an option it was buggy as hell. But I'll defs try recording a full vanilla warrior run in landscape, maybe target the new guys and play it at like double speed and narrate so it's not as long? IDK...  I'll see how I go with other thread participation got any tips on where to look, I'm completely lost with the interface on reddit hahaha. Kind of wanted to just chuck out the idea and see what people would like to see/watch expand the proverbial ideas pool :P Do you know of anyone else doing tutorials and such? What kinds of tutorials would be good do you think? Was thinking a something like 'How to get the Wands and Rings identified badge' for more advanced players. Don't know where to start really with beginners.. Have a 'how to use projectiles up as part of the first series.  We'll see how it all pans out. Also what's the Hall of fame thing? Should I try and do that or...?"
PixelDungeon,348tmb,roastedlasagna,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:06:50 2015 UTC,"The reddit interface is confusing for sure, but the best way sit to just adjust to it. Your participation so far is good, and you don't need to literally follow the 10% guideline (that is, you don't need to make 9 posts on other things for every time you promote your channel). As long as you are following the basic idea of participating in other places, then you should be fine.  I'm not aware of anyone else doing tutorials for Pixel Dungeon, which is why I am offering all of these suggestions. I would like to see more content like this, for new players and veterans alike. For beginners, I would recommend showing them the very basics (look at the first few paragraphs here, and you can see exactly what veterans take for granted that new players need to learn). The badge thing is definitely good for advanced players, although I've never seen the all wands/all rings badge identified.  For the Hall of Fame, that's an optional leaderboard for people who have won in Pixel Dungeon or Shattered Pixel Dungeon. You're more then welcome to submit there if you want to get on the leaderboard, or not. If you submit vanilla wins, we also give special flair to those users (flair: the image and text that appears next to your username, mine is the burning fist)."
PixelDungeon,348tmb,roastedlasagna,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll try and have some inputs :) And  maybe start compiling screenshots for the leaderboards, but I've honestly deleted most of the wins and only kept the interesting screenshots haha.  Aw well.  Really? Never seen it. I wrote a bit tute on the wikia on how to get them There probably a few now that have it. Or the rings on at least :) Here's a prezzie :P  https://plus.google.com/b/111063473871921825825/111063473871921825825/posts/TQK3zxK5iQZ?pid=6143423873837946322&oid=111063473871921825825  Maybe it IS a good idea to do a tute on it :)"

Very impressive that you managed to do it. It's probably because most redditors don't participate on the wiki (although we use it as a reference), and vice versa. Which is unfortunate, because everyone over there is missing out.  But yes, I'm sure a tutorial on how to get those badges would indeed be a good idea."

PixelDungeon,344cwp,Zapzyt,3,Tue Apr 28 05:01:34 2015 UTC,"I just want to suggest that maybe we should do Shattered challenges as well/instead. I honestly think that in this subreddit there are more Shattered players then not, and I really don't want to go back to the base game to do a challenge. Just a thought, sorry if it's in the wrong place."
PixelDungeon,344cwp,gohjohn,2,Tue Apr 28 11:38:14 2015 UTC,"You bring up a fair point, and we have considered this. We even asked the subreddit whether they would prefer vanilla challenges or challenges that include other mods. Most people preferred to keep vanilla, so that's what we have done.  If an overwhelming majority no longer wants it to be vanilla only, we will reconsider. Here's the changes that we would make the the CC if people prefer. First, the competition will be open to all mods, not just Shattered. Even though Shattered is the most popular mod, it is still just that: a mod. Many other modders put in hard work and hardly get noticed here, and we wouldn't want to further exclude them simply because they are not as popular. Second, unique subreddit flair will no longer be given. This is because the competition will be easier, and giving flair would undermine the flair that was given to those who had to complete the challenges on vanilla only. Third, because there would be no prize for winning, the moderators would no longer be as strict on submissions. This would make the CC more like ""just something to try out"" instead of a ""competition.""  Alternatively, you are welcome to try and set up your own Shattered challenge. Because the vanilla CC would still be active, a Shattered challenge would not get stickied or mentioned in the sidebar announcement. But, if you feel strongly about it, you can try and organize something. I recommend talking with /u/00-Evan about this, he might be able to help add a link in the sidebar and keep it updated.  Long story short: if you feel strongly about this, and can get other people to agree with you, we will change the CC as outlined in the second paragraph. If you feel strongly, but the majority does not, you can still try and create your own challenge."

PixelDungeon,3418qj,Heavy_Lobster,2,Mon Apr 27 16:01:24 2015 UTC,Flame potions ignite five squares in a + shape when they break.  Stand more than one square away from the thing you want to burn. :c

PixelDungeon,3411xh,NCOSRane,4,Mon Apr 27 13:43:31 2015 UTC,"This is something I'm very worried about in shattered actually.  I have A LOT of stuff planned, and I'm finally in a position to start moving forward with it, but that doesn't change the fact that content has been very slow for the past 4-5 months or so. I really hope I'm able to keep things rolling and prevent people from burning out."
PixelDungeon,3411xh,00-Evan,2,Mon Apr 27 17:23:26 2015 UTC,Well even diablo gets boring eventually. With the absence of a multilayer feature it's only a matter of time before gamers get bored.   But multiplier is really hard to implement with this kind of system. I do have an idea for a survival mode. Basically a big empty level similar to floor D-300 or something level. A monster is introduced every number of steps. The number of steps and difficulty of monster increases with time (or game steps). Items randomly spawn etc...  Basically a mode which never ends but is thrilling to get than extra step before dieing. Kinda like a body count mode. I can see a high score list.
PixelDungeon,3411xh,BilbolDev,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"somebody please make a ""hunger games"" multiplayer mod!!"
PixelDungeon,3411xh,eridal,2,Mon Apr 27 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"I would try an all-challenge run on pd. Its what got me playing again. Its also gotten exponentially harder since /u/wordsaladsandwich actually did it a while back, but its still fun. Even just a no armor run is quite invigorating once you get down to the demon halls. Hell at that point you can just toss your clothes off.  That said I think these games do have a limit to how long they are playable, unless the content creator continually updates, but that's hard for someone who probably isn't making much money from the game."
PixelDungeon,3411xh,toadnovak,2,Mon Apr 27 17:12:21 2015 UTC,This is a really fun one to do! Took me AGES and I agree you have to re-learn the game to play through like that. Reminded me of when I first started :D  Going back to vanilla felt like cheating though...

PixelDungeon,3411xh,EstherDarkish,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"For a moment I tried to win with the highest level possible. It was dependant on the number of XP potions you could find/craft.  Skillful is fun in suicide mode, you can lose 3 hours of progress in 20 seconds, fun stuff.  My current goal with Shattered is to find the Dried Rose, never saw it in 150+ games..."
PixelDungeon,3411xh,BilbolDev,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"I see suicide mode as the balance to the skills. In Skillful PD, it doesn't so much matter what gear you find, because you get significantly better with each level, and have some active thrashing skills you can dish out on top of those passive ones.  So you're not really in much danger from that sewer crab just because you're still in cloth armor with that starting weapon, because you're level 4 with 4 points in your two best passive skills, and if things get hairy, you'll use an active skill to finish the job.  But give yourself 12 starting hp, triple the monster's hp, make nearly every monster spawn with some kind of superpower, and life's not as easy."
PixelDungeon,3411xh,BilbolDev,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:43:53 2015 UTC,It's not tipple HP :)  The real danger is from the number of champs not the regular ones. And the goo :o
PixelDungeon,3411xh,CoolJoe16,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:09:53 2015 UTC,"Whatever the math might be.  Anyway, I find any of the easier levels way too easy.  Like just last night, I breezed through the game on normal - my first serious run.  Warrior, turned gladiator after Tengu.  Mediocre gear until I lucked into plate and glaive in the Dwarf area, and an evasion ring +2.  The whole time, I was stronger than everything.  Just dumped all my points into melee and training.  Sick damage.  Nothing stood a chance.  I never even used an active skill.  Hit level 26 easily.  Even cleared the demon halls.  Champions were like bonus points - free items for guys that took two or three hits and might poison or weaken me for a few steps.  Heck, for a good bit of the dungeon levels, I was using cursed gear, and I still was kicking everything's ass with sick damage.  I beat Tengu with cursed gear (dual swords -2 and some cursed ring I never identified), made it to the level 11 shop, and bought a remove curse scroll.  In the end, I finally died on my way out of the dungeon with the amulet.  Saw an acidic scorpio and figured I'd get that rare monster out of the way.  I did so much damage to it in one hit that the reflected damage killed me."
PixelDungeon,3411xh,SGAdventures,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:06:02 2015 UTC,Warrior is the strongest class. I admit my version is either too easy or too hard. Doesn't have the same 'balance' shattered or the original have.   Perhaps I should increase monster stats for hard and above
PixelDungeon,33yxxu,Stencile,3,Sun Apr 26 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"This is in original with degradation. I've been trying to max out my winrate, so these are all with Gladiator. I'm at just about 1 in 4 right now -- I think if I made absolutely no errors I could get it to around 1 in 3, but I'm not sure the winrate can go much higher than that in vanilla.   I haven't found degradation to be much of an issue. The RNG seems to be a little more forgiving since Watabou rolled out degradation, so I don't think it would be fair to categorize degradation as crippling the game. I just keep a little more focus on making sure no end-game items actually lose a +1 through degrading, so that usually means keeping a scroll of upgrade or two on hand at all times.   I personally find I enjoy vanilla a little more than Shattered, mostly due to the relative simplicity of vanilla. Happy hunting!"

Degradation certainly requires more planning ahead. If I didn't keep equipping cursed armor/weapons early on with no scrolls possibly up to 2 out of 3 seems possible."

So don't blame me if it doesn't work. (Unlocking huntress by killing DM300 is the safer bet)  Also, degradation is definitely possible with huntress. In fact I think original is easier than shattered for huntress (coz Evan nerfed invisibility)."
PixelDungeon,33svy2,Heavy_Lobster,4,Sat Apr 25 08:10:46 2015 UTC,"Are you equipping your Boomerang as your melee weapon as well?  For the Huntress there's no reason to waste upgrades on any equipment that isn't your boomerang for the beginning of the game. When you equip it as a melee weapon as well, you get to take advantage of all those upgrades at range and at melee distance.  Personally I loved playing as the Huntress for that reason because there's no tough decision about what to use the upgrade  scrolls on or juggling low level weapons."
PixelDungeon,33svy2,nahlej,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:21:53 2015 UTC,Did not know I could do that.  So equipping the boomerang as a weapon lets me do the same damage with the same accuracy in melee range?  Does using it as a melee weapon still let me use the armor-piercing sniper thing?  I'm playing Shattered if it matters.
PixelDungeon,33svy2,NCOSRane,2,Sat Apr 25 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think equipping the boomerang gets around the fact that at melee range, it has seriously reduced accuracy.  That said, the door thing works for boomerangs as well, so if your boomerang is your highest damage weapon, use it rather than your melee weapon.  Bats are tough until you have decent armor or a boomerang upgraded enough to get them fast."
PixelDungeon,33svy2,jyjjy,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:56:42 2015 UTC,I think the only time this has been a big issue for me is when getting to 11 at a lower level than usual which affects accuracy/dodge.

Attacking 'around corners' is extremely helpful haha. Otherwise armour and evasion are the only things that are going to stop bats healing off you.  Also never underestimate a blinding seed, the bat won't trigger it but YOU can by throwing rations or something on the seed as the bat flies over.

Activate that Attach wand of slowness on that, this makes it extremely  efficient and you can slow down everyone you see first and kill them without losing health.  Make use of wand of amok as well. With your low health and slowness you should be able to destroy everything before they get a chance to hit you. Use wand of regrowth where it's safe and see if you can get extremely lucky and find a green seed, use it and heal you."
PixelDungeon,33q6pb,Spawn9860,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:52:33 2015 UTC,I think most of the dwarf city monsters are immune to amok.
PixelDungeon,33q6pb,NCOSRane,2,Sat Apr 25 21:08:47 2015 UTC,Try to use the wand of slowness on the monks so they can't get in as many swings on you. Use the wand of amok on the strongest mob you see when you come across a group of enemies – mages and golems hit for the most damage so target them first. Don't try to charge a mage because they will burn your health down quick. Good luck

If you have a weak weapon, use seeds, wands, projectiles, fire potions(try to save up planning ahead for them) to weaken them before leading through doors for guaranteed hits. If you are near stairs, fight them ontop of the stairs so you can go up/down a floor to reequip your weapon. If playing shattered, the rogue s shadow cloak is really helpful against them(go invisible to reequip weapon and get a free hit). With poor equipment luck they can be extremely annoying to deal with."

While it is possible to fight your way through unscathed, I'd say one has to use at least ~3 health potions to engage these floors, and possibly another -hpot against the D King.  Lucky for you, warlocks sometimes drop potions. While they have a nasty ranged attack, they have the least devastating melee in this area so I warrior can usually fight them on good terms.  First, go buy all the health potions in the shop."

PixelDungeon,33h9pw,roastedlasagna,10,Wed Apr 22 14:46:38 2015 UTC,It's awesome that watabou recognizes that legacy mode is a wanted feature which increases the appeal for people getting it on Steam.  This would also mean that mobile should get legacy mode in the future. :)

PixelDungeon,33h2va,hpp3,2,Wed Apr 29 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Wizard's Staff is like the boomerang but for wizards. It's a wand that you can put every upgrade scroll into and use it as a primary weapon (as opposed to magic missile, which falls off hard)."
PixelDungeon,33h2va,hpp3,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"My guess:  Wizard's Staff: I am going to guess it has a range component. This range component is a weak magic missile at the start but when fused with other staffs, it absorbs their effects. Can also expend a limited amount of charge to repel enemies away for zoning purposes.   Runic Plate: Restores charges when hit. May shoot out random lighting and fireballs and iceballs.   Ethereal Chain: Turns targeted enemy ethereal. Enemy is slowed but cannot be hurt physically. Takes extra magic damage. Can be cast on own character. Take only magical damage and immune from physical damage for a time.  I am probably wrong haha"

Otherwise it's a very tough slog with the normal payoffs: maybe a healing potion or two a level, maybe some food, maybe not.   I think the lowest level I have beat the game with was 21."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,Concani,2,Wed Apr 22 16:27:28 2015 UTC,So I could have beaten it. Damn. I kept thinking I should look at a guide since I've never been there before. I had so many good items too. /cry
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,khondrych,2,Wed Apr 22 16:56:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't actually think I have ever fully cleared the Halls before getting the Amulet.
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,i_must_work_harder,2,Wed Apr 22 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Avoid all fights if you can. Wand of teleportation and those seeds that blind, teleport, or confuse the enemy are your best friends in the Halls. Even Teleportation scrolls if you're in a real bind, but at the same time you can get dropped in a room with a bunch of baddies and fuck your day over, so only use them if you have to. Also make sure you use torches to light up the fog of war, and as other people have said, Scrolls of Magic Mapping and Potions of Mind Vision will help you scope out the level and find the fastest way to the exit with the least amount of baddies.  The evil eyes, in particular, will absolutely MERK you. They are armor piercing. So that +6 plate you have doesn't mean jack shit to them, they will destroy you and then maybe only leave a dewdrop for consolidation when you kill them. You WILL go through all your health potions trying to fight them. Don't. Just run to Yog. I wrote a quick guide to Yog elsewhere in this thread, that's worth checking out too."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,tso,5,Wed Apr 22 20:10:47 2015 UTC,As soon as you're in the twenties the boss is beatable. Do everything you can to dash through the demon halls. Don't fight anything if you can avoid it.
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,gpgpg,2,Wed Apr 22 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Sadly i have found that even if i rush my way through the halls, i get trashed by the fists soon after setting foot in the boss room.  These days i find myself considering a run where i reach the demon halls a good run, as the final levels needs a level of play (in terms of action management) i am incapable of reaching."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,Morleen,4,Wed Apr 22 17:11:58 2015 UTC,"A mind vision and an invis or two for the final boss is really helpful.  They let you see where it so you can lure the fists away, and set up between the eye and a wall."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,gpgpg,4,Wed Apr 22 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, mind vision+invisibility when you get to floor 25 helps out a lot. Use mind vision+invisibility right away, freeze/paralize one of the fists so they are seperated, kill fire fist first then kill rotten fist while standing in water and it ends up being one of the easier parts of the game."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,i_must_work_harder,3,Wed Apr 22 17:50:45 2015 UTC,Or don't even bother killing the fists if you can help it.
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,khondrych,2,Wed Apr 22 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"Don't think a level of play is beyond you. The game is on autopause. The game only plays when you do. Just think, then do."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,ThisIsMyLastAccount,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"How to beat Yog: It's very easy with the right stuff.  Go in and move out of the square so the floor generates. Then, immediately, use a mind vision to scope out the eyes and the fists, then an invisibility. If you have a scroll of multiplicity or whatever it is, also use that before you invis to distract the fists, but that's purely optional.  Then, get your ass over to the eye while invisible. You need an earthroot. Your ideal place to throw that and set up camp is right next to the eye, on water, and if you're lucky, up against a wall or a corner.   If you have Wand of Flock, here's where it shines (but once again isn't mandatory). Use it to create a barrier around yourself. Otherwise, start whacking the larvae out of the eye. If you get lucky, you'll have a nice meat shield of larvae to protect you from the fists. If the fists get to you first, narf an invisibility and wait for them to go away, repeat until you have your meat shield, BUT SAVE ONE INVISIBILITY FOR AFTER THE FIGHT. Then just start whacking at the eye, use poison wand if you have, and/or toxic gas+purification if you have for extra oomph. I'm not sure if fire works on Yog, but every time I've fought him, the eye's on water so it doesn't matter. Bees aren't the worst idea here either.  Basically once you're set up just keep whacking the eye and narfing health potions til he's dead. At this point the fists die too, but you're stuck with enough larvae to potentially kill you in one turn if your earthroot's run out or something. So then you use the invisibility you saved til after the fight (you did that part, right? Otherwise a scroll of lullaby or terror, or paralytic gas+purification will do). In any case, assuming you used invisibility, wait until the larvae scatter, then do a mad dash for the door to the Amulet.  Congrats, you beat the game!"
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,khondrych,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the toxic gas concept, as it kills the larva protecting you, which isn't worth it."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,NCOSRane,1 point,Sun May 10 08:13:03 2015 UTC,True. I've never done it myself. Maybe it'd be nice at the end of the fight
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,Morleen,2,Sun May 10 22:11:01 2015 UTC,"I clear the demon halls maybe half the time. It really depends on gear and how many potions I have left.  It's rough with huntress because two of the monsters there have better ranged attacks than you do, and the third can teleport.  Honestly, I never find anything good down there. The guys in charge really ought to up the quality of the loot in the last few floors to reward you for actually risking it. Most people just use magic mapping and mind vision to sneak their way to Yog.  Yog is gosh darn easy. I don't get people who go for these screwy set-ups where they hide against the wall, blanket themselves behind larvae, etc. I just kill the fists. They're not hard. Stand in lava to avoid caustic ooze from the fighting one. Put the fighting one and/or a wall between you and the magic one (or get them both right next to you) to avoid those bolts. You're in lava, so you won't be set on fire by the magic one. Kill the fighting one first, obviously. If you have the potions, just do the gas potion thing. Spend all your bombs, crack open your bee pots. Use all your earthroots. It's not like you're saving them any more.  Then hit the eye once, kill larva. Hit it again, kill larva. Rinse, repeat."
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,khondrych,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:50:53 2015 UTC,"Try to save 3 mapping scrolls for floors 22-24. Chase scorpions into rooms and wait outside the doors for easy kills. Use corners to avoid getting shot by multiple eyes at once. Try and keep a few teleport scroll/fadeleaf seeds for if you get surrounded and charmed. Try to avoid ranged battles with eyes and scorpions. Avoid being more than two spaces away from the charming succubi or they warp to you and hit you. Kill everything until you are level 26(you don't get any more xp after that) and you usually end up with an upgrade scroll or two, some potions, and other good stuff. You could also save 2-3 mind vision and invisibility potions and sneak through easily, but where's the fun in that?"
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,Morleen,2,Wed Apr 22 17:39:48 2015 UTC,There's no reason to be level 26. Run to the exit and only fight what you have to.
PixelDungeon,33hjxd,khondrych,0,Wed Apr 22 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"Better accuracy against the fists at 26+ vs fighting them at level 22, 20-30 more health so you can take an extra hit or two from the fire fist, you should find ethier a strength potion or upgrade scroll so added damage. I see no reason to skip it unless you only have one or two health potions left."

I love it when devs really try to reach out to the community, and act as more  than just ""that person who makes announcements that you get excited about.""

Favorite experience with this sub/developing Shattered? To fedora, or not to fedora? How tall are you?"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Upside-DownFish,8,Wed Apr 22 01:13:36 2015 UTC,"Hey fish!   Deli meat without question. PB&J is nice too but I'm a carnivore at heart. I speak a tiny bit of horribly broken french, but aside from that no(ignoring programming languages). I've always been interested in learning a 2nd language, I'd probably try Russian or Korean. Until that happens the only thing I'm confident in saying in another language is ""Je ne parle pas français"" My mobile device history is: Nexus S -> Nexus 4 -> Galaxy Note 4. All I have to say about the Nexus 6 is YOU F**KED IT UP GOOGLE! I also have a 2012 nexus 7 on the side. Honestly, my favorite moment happened a few weeks after posting the app to google play. Not to detract from moments with the sub, which are awesome, but this really stuck out. I got a bug report in really well formatted english for a super minor issue, from a 12 year old kid in South Korea, who took his lunch break to report the issue to me. Not only was that so heart-warming, but it was when it really hit me just how many people were downloading Shattered. I actually think fedoras are pretty neat hats, such a shame they've been ruined by the neckbeard meme. about 5'11'' last I checked, it's above average but I feel like I'm short =(."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Upside-DownFish,2,Wed Apr 22 01:35:09 2015 UTC,"Came up with a couple more questions; just some more casual stuff :)   Favorite/least favorite subject in school? Mechanical or wooden pencils? Do you prefer punching in numbers with the numberpad or the horizontal strip above the letters? Do you listen to music? If so, favorite genre/artist? Do you consider yourself a good cook? What other kinds of gaming devices do you have besides PC/Android? Do you preorder games? Contacts/glasses?

Mechanical, less wasteful, more precise, albeit a bit more expensive and easier for someone to steal. if it's a couple then row above, if it's an actual calculation the numpad. I generally like videogame music, various electronic music, (good) dubstep, and occasionally some pop. No particular artists. AAAbsolutley not. I have a Wii U and 3DS as well, but most of my gaming is on PC. Only when I know i'm going to buy them regardless of reviews, which is rare. I don't use either, but given how annoying I've heard contacts are, probably glasses. Aside from elementary school hi-jinks I can't think of anything particularly stupid/dangerous I've seen. I do a lot of article reading online, but other than that not really. I do like novels, but I would rather be doing something interactive.

PixelDungeon,33f7hz,B_Boll,7,Wed Apr 22 21:59:50 2015 UTC,Is there any chance you could add more strategic quest decisions?  A great example is the Rotberry quest. You can use it to gain a combat or non-combat wand. Great element of choice. You can even carry the berry onward to utilize as a weapon and turn it into a potion of strength.  The other quests like the Blacksmith or the introductory quest somewhat lack that. The blacksmith's reward allows that degree of choice assuming you have the materials to achieve it.  These sorts of things I feel allow for interesting gameplay decisions allowing players to better utilize the cards they're dealt.    Side note: Will the blacksmith's [Mine 15 Ore] quest get tweaked at all? It feels super food & time consuming compared to the 'Slay a bat' quest.    I love the game. I've recommended it to anyone I know who enjoys roguelikes.
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,B_Boll,4,Wed Apr 22 01:18:47 2015 UTC,"Quests are my favorite thing to rework when I rework a set of floors. I have plans for quests, but I'm currently they focus on diversity in the quest itself instead of the quest rewards. I do agree though that strategic decisions are very neat, and quests are a big candidate for that, as my plans get more concrete I'll look to improve there too. Perhaps  The Wand maker will still need corpse dust or rotberry, though I may give him a 3rd quest too. You might find that both of those items will be a bit better protected though.  For the blacksmith, I have plans too though they're less certain. Perhaps he'll need you to go grab some ore in an area more interesting than the floor you're currently in. No guarantees on that one though, need to investigate feasibility first.  Glad you like the game!"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,roastedlasagna,6,Wed Apr 22 02:03:53 2015 UTC,"Hey Evan,  I have a lots of questions, but I'll try and narrow it down to the most important ones. Feel free to skip any if they take too long to answer.   When did you first start playing Pixel Dungeon? When did you first realize you wanted to make a mod for it? How did you come up for the idea for artifacts? When you first published to the Play Store, did you see Shattered becoming as successful as it is now? What is your favorite weapon? Armor? Ring? Artifact? What exactly is the ""Mage's staff"" that you have teased for the next update? What is your favorite food? I see you whistle innocently a lot. How often do you whistle suspiciously?"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,molmsted98,7,Wed Apr 22 01:14:52 2015 UTC,"Hey Roasted!   I first started playing juuust before the dwarven halls were added, which puts me at a bit before mid-2013. When I play games I often have moments were I think ""I could do that better."" I had one of those moments when I got my first win after finding a lucky +3 warhammer on floor 2, the win felt undeserved. As I kept playing I racked up a lot of those moments. The second I heard about the source going open I wanted to make a mod, that was about 3-4 months before it happened though. Halfway through reworking rings I was at a roadblock, where I was on the verge of totally killing more than half of the rings. Ultimately I couldn't come up with none-OP effects for most of the rings that gave utility, as in order for them to be worth it to upgrade they had to be as good as or better than raw combat stats. Then I hit on the idea of gear that scales without scrolls of upgrade, and that concept grew over a 30 minute or so brain-wave to become artifacts. As I started converting the rings to artifacts I realized there was a lot of room to make really cool effects and scaling mechanisms. I'm incredibly pleased with how artifacts turned out, they answer one of the game's biggest balance problems, as now it's possible to design gear without having to justify spending scrolls on it. I was excited when I hit 500 downloads in the first week, I'm now approaching 500k and that's still with no advertising and tonnes of content yet to come out. It has been so unexpectedly successful it is completely changing how I consider my career options. My favourite weapon is the Mage's Staff. My favorite armor is probably the runic plate. My favorite Ring is the Ring of Magic. My favorite artifact is definitely the ethereal chains. That's one thing I'd like to keep some mystery around, but I'll fill in a few gaps =). The mage's staff is going to be the Mage's unique starting item, replacing his wand of magic missile and his knuckledusters. It is key to the mage's rework, and it's going to enable him to have much more varied and interesting gameplay. Anything I can eat far too much of and then regret(not really) afterward, usually cheap Chinese food. That's my secret Roasted, I always whistle suspiciously."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Kosmenko,2,Wed Apr 22 01:54:18 2015 UTC,Am I right to assume you give a few tips to new contents?

PixelDungeon,33f7hz,shadowokker,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:42:44 2015 UTC,"Two quick follow up questions :)   Referring to question 3, how exactly have donations helped you in creating Shattered? What should people know about where their money goes when they donate to you? Referring to question 4, what is your favorite wand? Seed? Potion? Scroll? Are there any other ""favorite"" items you have?   And thanks for making an awesome mod!"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,shadowokker,5,Wed Apr 22 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"I've not actually done anything with the money yet. I want to spend it as intelligently as possible, so it takes some planning. The most immediate stuff that I want to eventually use the money on is legitimate music and spritework by people who know their stuff, I'm hoping to get back into contact with Cube Code to see if that will work out. The largest possible benefit is of course that the money is enough to live on (even if living means renting a single room and eating ramen), in which case my time and mental energy that's free to work on games would increase tremendously. Ultimately donation money adds to the potential growth and strength of the game, but it's still up to me to actualize that, watch this space. My favorite seed is probably seed of Blandfruit or Starflower. My favorite scroll is probably mirror image when its empowered. My favorite potion is probably experience, given its upcoming synergy with the warlock. Favorite wand is a very tricky one, there is so much fun stuff in the pipeline, I'll go with wand of fireblast for now, but it changes daily."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,kawatan,6,Wed Apr 22 02:49:32 2015 UTC,What has been the best lesson you have learned regarding app development?
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,shadowokker,9,Wed Apr 22 01:09:46 2015 UTC,"That is a tricky one.  I've learned a fair bit about a lot of different things while making Shattered (and also working my job, which I'm fairly fresh into) and it's hard to pick a particular point.  As far as dev specifically, I'd say the most important thing I've learned, which is really more about solo projects in general, is the importance of building a QA process. At my job there are code reviews, dedicated QA people, lots of established structure and practice to keep bugs and other errors out. When you're on your own it's sort of freeing to not have to deal with that, but at the same time if you don't come up with your own rules and procedures, stuff goes wrong very very quickly. Especially for apps where you have thousands to millions of users, a tiny mistake that gets into the game could mean countless of people lose save information. It's like proof-reading an essay, but if you typo the printer catches on fire.  As far as the best thing I've learned in general, at the risk of sounding corny: chase your dreams. Now that I have the perspective of working a job plus doing this on the side, more and more my life plan is less ""maybe I'll make games"" and more ""I have to make games, how do I make that happen?"". If I hadn't done Shattered I have no idea how lost I would be right now. I've grown so much as a person in the last year and Shattered carries a lot of that. Even if what you make will suck and you have no idea where to start, just go and do things you want to do, nothing is going to wait for you. Starting is so incredibly important, no matter what sort of start it is. True to form for me, I started at the last second, if I hadn't seen the source being opened and decided to just do it, I would have regretted it immensely."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Truxtunator,3,Wed Apr 22 01:24:30 2015 UTC,Hi Evan! I recently played a game as a mage and ended up with two dew vials in the sewers. Planning anything suspicious...?  I really love shattered! Any thoughts on improving level design and generation like you've done with 26? Or a possible extension in floors?
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Truxtunator,5,Wed Apr 22 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"Hey!  The double vial is a little hiccup that happened for saves carried over from 0.2.3 to 0.2.4, I changed a bit of internal logic for keeping track of drops. I have all sorts of things planned that are much more interesting than a 2nd vial.  Glad you like the game =). I have a number of thoughts on level design but I've mostly been focused on other areas so I haven't really refined or tested any of it. One of the smaller updates between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0 is going to rework traps, and while I'm there I may do some looking into what's possible with the current level gen logic. Big set-piece areas though, like boss floors, I have very neat plans for. I also want to see if it's possible to make maps larger than 32x32, while that may not be as important for general floors, bigger maps give me lots more creative room for special stuff."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,JimJam707,3,Wed Apr 22 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"Glad to know you're going to rework boss floors. The update to Goo was great and makes it much more fun.  I'm interested in what you have planned for Tengu. That fight is so tedious and boring and really could use some more excitement in it for sure!  Bigger floors sure as heck sounds awesome, but I hope it would be a toggle. I don't know that I'd want to run through 26 64x64 or 128x128 floors. I feel like that would get incredibly tedious and make game starts ridiculously resource scarce if not balanced right. Especially since food can occasionally be a problem already, can't imagine how it would end up with 128x128. Eek!"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Jaemad,2,Wed Apr 22 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean when I say that it's not really needed for general floors, I would only want to make those slightly larger, and perhaps only in certain cases (would be a neat level feel).  A larger boss floor though, that might work better, Hunger won't be an issue, I've done some tweaking in development to not make it as limiting when you're doing something like fighting a boss."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Jaemad,2,Wed Apr 22 02:30:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, Evan. Thanks so much for the mod of PD, I really love it.   I've played games for years but PD is the first rogue-like I've spent significant time with. What are some of your favorite rogue-likes that you would recommend, or drew inspiration from? And also what is your favorite, or a few of your favorite games from outside the genre?"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Jaemad,6,Wed Apr 22 01:28:46 2015 UTC,"It may be a surprise but I actually have no experience with traditional roguelike games, aside from playing the original rogue a little as a curiosity. The roguelikes I've mostly played are some of the more modern twists on the genre, stuff like Binding of Isaac, FTL, Spelunky, and more recently Darkest Dungeon.  My inspiration is almost 100% from Pixel Dungeon itself, seeing problems and thinking about how to fix them. In a sense I see this as a strength, as it means I do things because I have my own reasoning for doing them, not simply because X roguelike also does that thing."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,B_Boll,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:19:49 2015 UTC,"That's interesting! I'm sure that does end up being a positive in the end, since you're not bogged down in any shoulds/shouldn'ts besides what makes sense or sounds fun.   I've been wanting to try FTL myself actually. Thanks for reminding me, and thanks again for all the work you've put into the game. Fun times :)"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Kosmenko,5,Wed Apr 22 02:24:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly find that games I have the most ""I could do that better"" moments on are games I don't have lots of time in the genre for, perhaps because I don't have what is expected to lean on.  A good example of this, which also answers your question as to what my favorite game is, is RuneScape. I have been playing that game for over half of my life now and I love it so much, but there is so much that could be better. My (pipe)dream is to be in control of design for a new iteration of RuneScape. (also, to be clear, I'm referring to old school RuneScape(and the pre-2011 game), I see RuneScape 3 as blasphemous, mainly due to microtransactions)"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,porh,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"Ha, well Runescape-speak is like a foreign language to me; I've never played them even for all that I've heard about them. But I can understand that. Same thing happens with a lot of things, a fresh pair of eyes can often bring really good ideas to the table, or spot issues that someone in the genre may have missed."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Dreteus,2,Wed Apr 22 03:02:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not Evan, but a lot of the mechanics from the original Pixel Dungeon that carried over into Shattered PD are actually inspired by Brogue: you'll recognize the single stat (strength), enchanting lowering strength requirements and increasing power, and some of the traps, wands, and rings. It's a very different game (no classes, an 'ally' mechanic that significantly changes the game, very different terrain...) but it might interest you."

No questions at this time as every one else gas been asking them all. i have found Your game is perfect for me and my job since i only get 15 minute breaks so i can pick it up and set it down quickly. I really apreciate the hard work and dedication youve show to us your players and your game. The fact that youve made an amazing and engaging game thats challanging and fun and constantly evolving made me beyond happy to donate 20 bucks. Ive bought worse games for more money so thank you.

PixelDungeon,33f7hz,thinbuddha,2,Wed Apr 22 13:23:48 2015 UTC,"I've never actually asked Watabou what he thinks of Shattered. He said it was fine to post it and ask for donations so presumably he's at least tried it, but I think he's the only one who knows the details on that."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Ed-Zero,2,Wed Apr 22 13:50:16 2015 UTC,Hey Evan.  I don't have any questions I just want to thank you.  I discovered pixel dungeon back when it was only 5 levels deep and instantly fell in love with it.  After a while I got frustrated with some of the mechanics and all but stopped playing.  That's when I heard about shattered here.  I fell in love with shattered even more then I had the original and at this point I have put more time into it and gotten more enjoyment out of it than any other mobile game.  So thank you for enriching my mobile gaming experience and thank you for being such an active and positive addition to the community!
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,Ed-Zero,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, glad you like the game!  If you don't mind my asking, what was it your found frustrating about vanilla PD that you don't see in Shattered?"
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,fiqri1999,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:22:50 2015 UTC,"I don't mind at all.  Well the rings always annoyed me and there was a lack of diversity (your artifacts fixed both of those).  It got to the point where the replay value got stale and having the artifacts helped a lot with that.  I feel like you did some balancing that helped too.  I can't name a specific thing that was balanced but the game feels ""smoother"" if that makes any sense.  Also the dewvial nerf was great (although I learned the hard way after dying on a really good run).  Hopefully this is helpful.  When I started playing it was always exciting to see what was added as they added new features and items and then it seemed to just hit a wall.  Your mod broke though that wall and made each round seem interesting again."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,greater_nemo,2,Wed Apr 22 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"That's awesome!  I do feel like arifacts are sort of carrying shattered at the moment, as the main attraction so to speak. That's not a bad thing of course, I'm very happy with how we'll they've gone, but my intention was never for them to remain as the only big headline feature for so long (6 months now!). Right now I'm in the thick of the next big update, and I hope that now that I'm more free to focus on content, artifacts will become one of the big features shattered is known for, not the only one."
PixelDungeon,33f7hz,greater_nemo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:16:49 2015 UTC,I'm so excited for the next update!!  I'm not a coder and I'm not even especially good at the game but as someone who has literally played the game since release feel free to message me any time if you want ideas or opinions =)

Gas potions, lightning wand, amok scroll, bombs (hell, bombs can be what you use to trigger the traps), and just plain going invis if things get rough (maybe get your cloak charged up beforehand)."
PixelDungeon,33f4ho,Heavy_Lobster,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:37:26 2015 UTC,"That's a really neat idea.  Maybe a super power of the Talisman since it's the trap-related item.  Or what if this isn't an artifact at all?  Just a common range weapon (I dunno. Some kind of magic orb.)  Does no damage normally, but if you toss it on to a trap, it gains that trap's power.  Then, the next time you throw it, it's consumed but fires off whatever trap you threw it into."

PixelDungeon,33b2cf,BobbleBobble,5,Tue Apr 21 02:45:09 2015 UTC,"Wielding weapons that require more strength only affects attacking speed, so if you equip that and let enemies chase you until you can ambush them behind doors (and get a sure hit), you'll get through those levels easily! But then again, ambushing crabs in the sewers and getting that sure hit is difficult."

PixelDungeon,336ivv,fiqri1999,2,Wed Apr 29 18:35:21 2015 UTC,Wait... I don't understand the scoring system from this challenge.
PixelDungeon,336ivv,molivious,2,Mon Apr 20 14:24:16 2015 UTC,"The best way to explain it would be with examples. Having the following in your inventory would give the listed amount of points:   Dagger+1 (9), Knuckleduster (10) is 2 points because you have 2 items in a row. Mace+2 (12), Mail armor (13), Quarterstaff-2 (14) is 3 points because you have 3 items in a row. Glaive+5 (13), Plate armor+3 (14), Scale armor (15) is 3 points because you have 3 items in a row.   In the event of a tie (like the second and third example), the third example would win because its largest number (15) is greater than the the second example's (14)."
PixelDungeon,336ivv,Morleen,2,Mon Apr 20 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's easier to explain this way: (items/points/str requirements)   Cloth Armor, Cloth Armor +1, and Cloth Armor +2 || 3 points || 10 > 9 > 8  Cloth Armor, Cloth Armor +2, and Cloth Armor +5 || NO POINTS || 10 > 8 > 5 Scale Armor, Cloth Armor -1, Dagger, Dagger +1, Boomerang +2 and Spear +5  || 5 points || 12 > 11 > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7   So any combination of items may be used to count towards your score. To gain points, you must have items with STR REQUIREMENTS arranged/fixed in a sequential or successive manner. Well, you don't have to arrange your inventory."

It is VERY diffcult to win any other way, and Warrior has it simplier because he starts with more strength, best weapon and ability to upgrade it without wasting upgrade scroll. Which is why you win with the warrior but not others.  There is another easy character, though: the mage. If you drop a wand of Firebolt or Disintegration, the strategy is dead simple: put all upgrades into that wand and... that's it, free win :)"
PixelDungeon,335jxg,Scharnvirk,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:33:56 2015 UTC,"So I'm on a run with Mage, and I have a question. Is it worth it to bother upgrading the knuckleduster, or a melee weapon at all?"
PixelDungeon,335jxg,Gorbonzo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about upgrading the melee right now. In my experience with the mage's total attack diversity (multiple wands, melee, etc.) it's better to upgrade your armor. Eventually when you get to lower levels and find a tier 4 or 5 melee, then you should sink some upgrades into it."
PixelDungeon,335jxg,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"Battlemage, no, definitely not.  Warlock, yes, but probably not the knuckleduster, and only if you don't have a firebolt or disintegration wand after getting to a reasonable depth.  For mages, you want to upgrade the best combat wand you have and the first suit of plate armor you find. And the definitely the magic ring if you find one. Melee weapons, not so much."
PixelDungeon,335jxg,Scharnvirk,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:43:38 2015 UTC,"A mage is just as capable with melee weapons as any other character. If you happen to find a decent tier 4 or 5 weapon, upgrade it like you would on warrior.   Knuckleduster for me is an equivalent of tier 3 weapon; it scales well, but later its damage is made really low because of enemies' armor which also scales double than normal (because knuckleduster deals two hits per turn). It is good as an enchanted weapon though, as it has double the proc chance because it is quicker.  If I were you I'd try to upgrade the starting wand once, keep the knuckleduster as it is, use up to 1 upgrade scroll on some armor (leather or mail, cloth is useless) and try to survive as long as you can - maybe you'll drop a good wand?"
PixelDungeon,335jxg,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Warrior is the hardest class to win with if you ask me. Your run is entirely dependent on finding and upgrading Tier 4/5 gear, hopefully a good ring or two, and farming a crapton of healing potions. As early in the game as humanly possible.  I take that back. Freerunner is the hardest for me, and warden sucks, too, but warrior is also pretty high up there for ""find good gear early or you're done"" status.  Mages, snipers, assassins -- you can take advantage of enemies a lot more easily and get yourself deeper without necessarily having to find good gear.  You might even make it to depth 15 or so with crap gear with any of those."

PixelDungeon,332ada,nefarious_tropy,4,Sat Apr 18 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"In SPD, rooms of traps have a small chance to be filled with summoning traps. Set off one, and the summoned mobs will appear on the others, setting off a chain reaction. I stepped in the room because I was going too fast, and they all appeared at once.   The best part is, I got away but set off an alarm trap had to fight them all one by one. Somehow killed them all with one health potion and ended up at like level 15 on depth 5."
PixelDungeon,332ada,RSquared,2,Sun Apr 19 01:13:26 2015 UTC,It's actually possible in vanilla too.  Great if you've got early scale or plate and can just step outside and tank a long series of 0 hits.

PixelDungeon,330htf,BilbolDev,1 point,Sat Apr 18 08:33:36 2015 UTC,"Warrior is OP. I would suggest the following:   Replace <Endurance> with <HP Regeneration: 1% or 2% increase per point> Remove the <STR boost> from <Training> <Melee:> is this like, 1 damage per point? If that is so, replace the whole effect with Training's STR boost effect, and nerf  it to <1 STR per 4 points>   Mage: your idea's fine. Meditation gave too much for a single skill.  Rogue: We discussed this before and I support what you've currently come up with.  Huntress: Never had any problems with her. Quite fun to have experienced ranged combat a lot for a change too.  Overall: I think you got it inverted. The old 2 points was decent for Hell and Suicide. You just need to nerf it for Hard difficulty and below, because they're all too easy with so many skill points."
PixelDungeon,330htf,molivious,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"I like endurance, and its synergy with the cursed scrolls. However, I do think endurance should be nerfed to +1 HP per level, so it becomes an effective +1 STR per 3 levels, depending on whether you actually find a Scroll of Sacrifice. This way, you can decide whether you want to be an ultra tank or a heavy hitter."
PixelDungeon,330htf,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point, actually. By the way you worded it, it looks like the cursed scrolls were made for his whole benefit, without suffering the supposed penalties. That extra HP must go. All classes could live without it. He gets bonus str anyway. Now put Melee and high-damage inducing actives on top of that, and he's ridiculously dwarfing other classes. He really needs that rework >_<"
PixelDungeon,330htf,molivious,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"Rogue is in no way weak, especially with assassin. If I can beat Tengu with Assassin on Hell with barely upgraded starting equipment, then I can sure as hell beat Yog on Normal.  Looting gives you a crapton of gold. At level 10, it's basically a 2x gold multiplier, and even at Level and Floor 6, You can easily buy all you need from the shop on your first visit, give or take a few minutes of exploration.   Side note: Gold farming from mimics is OP  Stealth is the best part about Rogue. It's already really powerful at level 5. Coupled with assassin, you deal tons of damage, all the time. Or, if you're using freerunner, it's either a very good speedrunning tool, or it means you can catch up with enemies fast so you can do a surprise attack quickly without being detected.  Venom IMO is not as good. It's still a useful skill, but there's not a lot of a point of putting more than 5 points in it.   My thoughts: You could swap Disable Trap with Venom. Disable Trap becomes passive, like you said in the post, and Venom gives you super poison 100% proc on next hit.  I find myself never using Shadow Clone, even though it's a great skill. In fact, I think it should become Invisibility, with Shadow Clone being moved to the Rogue's Hero Armour set ability. By the time you get the Hero Armour, the Shadow Clone ability will be very valuable.  Also, dualswords are in no way overpowered. Unupgraded dualswords are definitely not as viable as upgraded T4's. They totally don't deal 40 damage on everything, from an assassin's sneak attack."
PixelDungeon,330htf,TheCanadianAlligator,2,Sun Apr 19 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"Stealth actually works like ring of shadows; it isn't invisibility, it works as if enemy vision is reduced. So neither freerunners nor assassins get bonuses, they just become sneakier. Enemies will still detect you for certain once you get close enough...even if you were 10x faster."

I don't want to just copy what's been done elsewhere though obviously, so I don't have any concrete plans, but letting players invest in ranged weapons seems very likely.  My current roadmap is looking something like   0.3.0: wand & mage rework 0.4.0: enchantment & curse rework 0.5.0: weapon/armor & warrior rework 0.6.0: ranged item & huntress rework   That's with some uncertainty, and smaller updates sprinkled in between of course."

PixelDungeon,3302dx,McSchwartz,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"May I make another suggestion? Or two?  Wand of Telekenesis is not useful as is. Pushing away an enemy 1 square, only to have him return, means you accomplished nothing except wasted a turn, and allowed other enemies to get closer. Only if you need to pick up an item across a chasm, or a scroll on a fire trap, will it be slightly useful. It should push enemies 2 squares away, or some multiple of the wand's level. Perhaps it could do a small amount of damage, or maybe it could effect a swath of enemies. The wand has a limited number of charges, so it shouldn't be overpowered even with these changes.  The other thing is the Well of Knowledge. These things are already rare, and are just not as good as the other wells. The problem is that you need to equip the items that you want it to identify! If you equipped it you would already know if it's cursed or not! (and an equipped, unidentified item will soon be known.) Kinda defeats the purpose IMO. I realize it also shows you items on the map, but mostly I explore every level as thoroughly as I can, so I wouldn't miss those anyway. I think they should identify all the items in your backpack. Just makes more sense to me.  Hope you read this and thanks!"
PixelDungeon,3302dx,NCOSRane,2,Tue Apr 21 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"I agree completely that the wand of telekinesis is weak, it's going to get completely overhauled. I haven't got all the specifics pinned down yet, but I do know that it's going to be a mixed combat/utility wand, which will deal some damage while knocking around & stunning enemies.  You can actually throw an item you'd like to ID into the well too, but I agree it's a bit underwhelming. Identifying everything might be a bit too strong though."
PixelDungeon,3302dx,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, cool beans. I completely forgot about that throwing things into the well feature. Definitely makes it slightly more useful.

I can 100% say that there is absolute no logic to prevent multiple artifacts of the same type being in inventory, when I made artifacts unique in 0.2.2 I was very particular about that to ensure compatibility with existing saves. If there were some error that allowed many of the same artifact to spawn the game would only prevent you from equipping two of them.  Did you perhaps die with the horn and immediately start a new run? You could have taken the horn from your first hero's remains, which would explain this behaviour.

Every enchanted weapon I've found has lost its enchantment after a few upgrades. What am I missing here?  Sidenote: great game, I think it's a huge upgrade over the original -- but I still find most of the artifacts to be pretty much worthless, and I personally find the arcane stylus to be a gamble that inevitably ends in frustration.

PixelDungeon,32teoc,FNGsam,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:23:14 2015 UTC,Stylus is junk.  I only use it if I'm playing Sniper or Battlemage (more useful effects than not for ranged heroes).  Sometimes I'll use it if I have a +3 or higher armor and also have an upgrade scroll to wipe it if I don't like it.  Upgraded enchanted weapons are made by throwing upgrade scrolls into a well and hanging onto them until the weapon is +X.  You can find infusion scrolls if you have a certain ring in Shattered.

If I survive the goo, its just a slog to the bottom.  Would enjoy pixel dungeon more if it started easier, and got harder.  On skillfull, 1/3 of games on ""hell"", end on level 1 or 2.  2/3 of games end on 3 or 4, and random games end at bottom or on why there when I have an accident.  Some of the skills are easy to figure out, but not sure what some of them are, wisdom vs meditation?  Winning requires getting a solid item or two on first 2 levels.  This win I found a +2 ring of haste on first lvl."

In my version it's better gear + better stats (mainly warrior), so I think I might need to make deeper monsters stronger.  Edit: As for the goo damage, I didn't touch any of that code. Maybe if you die it doesn't show. It might have pumped up before it hit you."

PixelDungeon,32q523,Spawn9860,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:35:19 2015 UTC,The warrior is the easiest class to win with I believe. But just wait until you are able to be a warlock ;)
PixelDungeon,32q523,Concani,2,Wed Apr 15 22:05:38 2015 UTC,Oh no I meant after learning the game on my wizard. As a warlock I beat it after 60 tries. As a gladiator it only took me 3 lol
PixelDungeon,32q523,Cyathem,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:06:27 2015 UTC,Yea. Warlock is hard. I had a much easier time as zerker imo
PixelDungeon,32q523,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:05:10 2015 UTC,"Battlemage is by far the easiest class to win with. If and only if you find a firebolt or disintegration wand. If you do, you're essentially playing the game on easy mode. Why? Wands never miss, do sick damage, get 9 charges when they're upgraded to at least +7, and recharge pretty darn fast when you're a mage. And as a battlemage, you recharge them yourself by hitting something with them and do decent-ish damage in the process. And food restores a charge just in case. I just won with a battlemage an hour ago with 4 rations, two blessed ankhs, a full dew vial, and like a dozen healing potions leftover, bought everything of use in all of the shops. Didn't even sweat. I even cleaned up the demon levels, though they were kind of rough 'cause I had a disintegration wand instead of firebolt and those evil eyes resist disintegration.  (Assassin is a strong second for easiest class to win with.)  The warrior classes don't get nearly as foolproof of a set of special abilities. +1 strength, a weapon that gives you one free enchant-safe upgrade, +5 health when you eat, and a subclass-specific flavor of extra damage if and only if what you're aiming at doesn't dodge or block your attack. You need a good weapon and a good armor, and preferably good rings, all fairly well upgraded. Then, you need to stand there and trade hits with the bad guys and hope you farmed enough healing potions."

PixelDungeon,32q523,hpp3,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:13:36 2015 UTC,"Warlock can do basically the same thing. I used a +9 firebolt to one shot everything, and even though I couldn't recharge by attacking with it, a 9 charge wand that one shots isn't going to run out of charges during a fight. Because warlocks have innate sustain, I had plenty of food and could afford to rest frequently to keep my wand charged."
PixelDungeon,32q523,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:32:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of people like the warlock. Their health/food recovery per kill has always seemed kind of inconsequential to me. Not enough to matter unless you're ranging large numbers of strong enemies in a short time. And once things stop being worth exp, their special ability stops doing anything. Being a battlemage streamlines your decisions for you. You don't need to find a good weapon or worry how many upgrade scrolls to dump into it versus other items, because you're going to have a wand equipped. You can just sell every weapon you find. And if you get to the point where you're one-shotting most things with a firebolt or disintegration wand, you're not going to be taking much damage anyway, so restoring charges becomes a more useful ability than healing, though by that point, both abilities are a pretty minor perk alongside the fact that you have a reusable nuclear warhead in your quick slot."

PixelDungeon,32oh8w,Sappin,3,Wed Apr 15 12:56:53 2015 UTC,"First thing first : stop upgrading your armor ! +4 is generally enough to finish the game. In the dwarf fortress and bellow, they use black magic that negates your protection.  After that, I would equip the +6 artifact instead of the accuracy ring, it will help you not die to a stupid trap that could be avoided. Of course, if a level is already cleared or if you are about to enter a boss level, you should keep your accuracy ring for the level.  Finally, your stuff is a little shallow, I don't predict a good ending with the +1 axe, so you should maybe upgrade your firewand. It will help against the monks. If you can skip the level and go directly to the floor 20, you'll have beaten the hardest part of the game.  Your goal should be to find 2 dews to fill up your vial, then bless your ankh. After that, you should use your potions (identify them asap) to navigate through the demon halls.  The ultimate goal is to have, ready for the final boss :   A seed of earthroot 1-2 invisibility potions 1-2 mind vision potions, preferably more to help navigate through the demon halls : it helps avoiding the mobs, and you also can force every mob you see with the potion to sleep with your scrolls of lulaby (while also regenerating yourself if you are not starving !)

PixelDungeon,32oh8w,EstherDarkish,2,Wed Apr 15 17:51:32 2015 UTC,Upgrade your wand of firebolt as much as possible. Blast the monks with fire and be sure to be in melee battles with the dwarf monks*. That is what has helped me get through those levels the most.  *Unless I am mixing up which is which. I think it is the monks that can knock your axe out of your hands and the dwarf monks that do damage from afar.
PixelDungeon,32oh8w,canadianpastafarian,3,Wed Apr 15 13:27:12 2015 UTC,"It's the dwarven halls, so they're all dwarves. The monks are dwarf monks. You're thinking of the dwarf warlocks."
PixelDungeon,32oh8w,hpp3,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:48:18 2015 UTC,Must be. Thx.
PixelDungeon,32oh8w,canadianpastafarian,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:09:11 2015 UTC,I would put more upgrades into the battle axe.  Do you know the door trick?  If you attack a mob on the first turn where it enters sight (like it just walking through a door) it's a guaranteed hit.  This is extremely useful with high power weapons as you can often 1 hit kill mobs before they can fight back.  Especially useful for warlocks since they can't attack you until they open the door anyway.
PixelDungeon,32oh8w,Jaemad,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:38:27 2015 UTC,"You're in bad shape.  Only 4 healing potions.  If you skipped any in the shops between 6 and your current depth, go back and buy them.  Two more dewdrops and you can bless that ankh.  That might help a bit, too.  Every upgrade you own needs to go into that firebolt wand.  Stick it in a quick slot.  Stick your lightning wand in the other.  If a bad guy is in water or standing next to another bad guy, lightning.  Otherwise, fire.  Take it slow and keep your distance from the monks and golems.  Hide behind doors for the warlocks and just kill them with your axe to save charges.  Hopefully, you'll get some healing potions off of them.  When you make it to 20, try to kite the DM as much as it will let you. Lightning when it's on water, fire otherwise, steer it around the healing tiles.  An invis potion if you have one will let you make distance.  Your armor's good, but you don't have enough potions to be trading hits with that thing, plus with all of the dwarves in the dwarf levels.  Your gear looks good, yeah, but you're on your last leg resource-wise.  Trading hits with the unlimited number of hard-hitting dwarves that can appear in the next few levels won't get you far."
PixelDungeon,32oh8w,NCOSRane,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:47:01 2015 UTC,"Just for info, the DM is on floor 15. The dwarf boss is the Dwark King. The easiest way to beat him is to use 1-2 toxic potions between its pedestals, but OP's potions are not identified. The second next best way to beat him is with a cheesy trick : if a squeleton is on a the pedestal the King would like to go to, then the King will aggro you and not flee to the other pedestal. This way, you can kill him without him having more than one squeleton to help him."
PixelDungeon,32oh8w,EstherDarkish,2,Wed Apr 15 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I skipped a boss in my head. The dwarf king is actually a little easier than the DM if you know what you're doing, but there's that annoying risk of paralysis lasting for six years and getting instantly killed."
PixelDungeon,32pis3,deadby100cuts,2,Wed Apr 15 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"Abuse surprise attacks. If you do a surprise attack, it autohits. Usually you get your surprise attack by luring an enemy into following you through a door (hit them the turn they step onto the door way).   If you use this to guarantee hits on rats and gnolls, you'll take a lot less damage. It doesn't really work on crabs because they move so fast. For crabs you need good armor.

In most these, we've got rooms 3x larger than DM/Yog's boss room and monsters 3x tougher than what we're facing, which make ranged weapons almost necessary to peel damage before anything reaches your character. Although I haven't really played anything with wands, magic in those games also have limited range, placing some kind of sequence: Ranged > Magic > Melee  While long-range magics do exist, magic-immune/resistant enemies also do. This is something that PD is still missing. Such existence makes the choice between Ranged and Magic pretty dynamic when it comes to peeling.  There's also the hit-n-run tactic apparent in those games. Contrary to such, firing a single ranged projectile consumes a whole turn (aside from shurikens), making such tactic unusable in PD. If the damage, ammo amount, and delay values are to be tweaked so this tactic could be used, then that might just give hope to Pixel Dungeon's Guild of Dart Enthusiasts."

PixelDungeon,32hom5,Scharnvirk,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"Ranged weapons aren't supposed to be some game-changing thing you hoarde greedily. Throw them around liberally. They're just another resource, just like healing potions and food. Tossing those around to soften up enemies before they're next to you keeps you from eating as much damage, which means fewer used healing potions.  They're just a little extra umph. They can be completely replaced by a good wand or by the boomerang. But they fill a niche. My biggest problem with ranged weapons isn't what they do. It's that they're so situational. Three quarters of the time, you enter a room and have two guys next to you. You don't have a big room or hallway to toss darts all day long. I'd change a few things:   Allow ranged weapons to be thrown at a guy right next to you without penalty. Except for the boomerang. We don't want to make life too easy for snipers. But since everything else is limited in quantity, if I want to spend one of my darts paralyzing someone next to me, let me do it. Make shurikens poison the target. Or maybe even weaken the target. I know they're fast, but they're pretty useless. Every ranged weapon should have some utility, except for darts which are just there to get you started and do a little extra damage against rats while they close the distance toward you. Make incendiary darts explode in a 3x3 square like a liquid flame potion. Or significantly up their damage. Or find some other way to make them fun. Just to give them a little something so they're not completely replaced by the first firebolt wand you find. Make every non-mage class less proficient in wands (have them do damage like they're one level lower than the actuality). For those rare hero's remains cases, make every non-huntress class less proficient with the boomerang (or just make the boomerang non-transferable)."
PixelDungeon,32hc6z,Scharnvirk,9,Mon Apr 13 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"They actually aren't random, the game will spawn the container that will free up the most inventory spaces for you.  In most cases the scroll holder will show up by floor 10, like it used to, and in almost every run it will show by floor 15.  I do actually plan to rework traps, but fire is going to stay. I may change how fire works to only destroy one scroll at a time instead of a whole stack however. Toasting multiple scrolls at once is a bit unfair I'll admit."

Not to sound condescending, but I don't want SD to turn into something like Crawl, with every feature that's mildly inconvenient gets ""streamlined"" out of the game.  Possible sulotions could be making scroll holders and potion banoliers guaranteed to spawn in shops (like anhks) until you buy them or allowing them to spawn like potions of might and scrolls of magical imbuement.  Come to think of it, can you acquire banoliers and holders at wells of transmutation?  Edited; forgot to proof read."

PixelDungeon,32hc6z,EstherDarkish,2,Tue Apr 14 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"You can drop your upgrade scrolls at the entrance to a level, then come back for them after you've cleared the level.  You can search every single empty tile for traps.  You can use a scroll of magic mapping.  You can drink a frost potion, cutting your losses to just that first turn of burning.  You can start tossing scrolls the second you light up, cutting your losses at least somewhat.  Every one of those options uses a resource, be it food/time, the inconvenience of not having those scrolls on you to use right away if you find a +3 plate or well of transmutation, using up a map scroll or potion, etc.  When you walk into a fire trap and lose one or multiple upgrade scrolls, that is because you decided that conserving some resources was worth taking the risk of losing others. That risk didn't pay off for you, but it was your choice to take it. The game didn't screw you. You prioritized some resources over others."

PixelDungeon,32f06o,Concani,5,Mon Apr 13 06:42:16 2015 UTC,"Note: Sorry for the red shade, I was using Twilight on my phone.  I'm gonna tell a short story about my victory (Shattered Pixel Dungeon), because I'm a little bit excited after losing 81 rounds :P.  On round ~62 or something like that, I had actually gotten to the last boss once before. Unfortunately, I got destroyed because I was being stupid and didn't really know how the boss fight worked. I kinda walked around a bit before the fists ganged up on me and I got lasered into nothing. I lamented a bit because I had some nice equipment (even though I knew that I would make it there with just as good equipment again) and I thought I would never make it to the boss again.  This round, I started pretty well. I got a Scroll of Upgrade, so I just upgraded my short sword so I could reforge it if I wanted to. I had a pretty wide variety of potions already. I also had 2 Blandfruits (in case you haven't tried SPD, Blandfruits are fruits you can get from a Blandplant which, when cooked with a seed, provide useful fruits with the associated buff/debuff). I happened upon a glaive on floor 3, so I was pretty excited to be wandering around with a late-game weapon (although I had no way of holding it yet). When I get to the Sad Ghost, I like to get +1 scale armor or plate armor (I know, I'm picky). However, I got +2 mail armor, but I figured I would just roll with it.   After playing footsie with the Goo and nearly dying to its mass attack, I descended to floor 6. At this point I had 3 of the same unidentified potion, and I was hoping they were health potions (I figured that I buy the most abundant potion at the shop, which is usually the Health potion and save a bit). Luckily, I killed a swarm of flies, and they dropped that unidentified potion. In the prison I (think) I had 13 strength, and my glaive had +4 on it because I was lucky with finding Upgrade Scrolls. Once I found a Potion of Strength, I was excited, since I was blasting through the mobs with ease. On floor 7 (or something like that), I helped the old wandmaker out, and he gave me a wand of slowness +1. I was pretty determined to make it to the boss and attempt to kill it the right way at this point. The Tengu was also fairly easy, since I just slowed it a few times and poked it.  In the caves, I found a pile of bones. I expected it to be a pile of gold, but it turned out to be a +1 Horn of Plenty (I had died with it in a promising run right before this one). I like the Horn of Plenty, so it was only more encouragement. When I found the troll blacksmith, he had a plate armor laying on his floor, so that was a very nice find as well. He helped me buff my wand of slowness up from +1 to +2, since I had found another wand of slowness in the floor before. At this point, my glaive was +7. I found a Scroll of Upgrade on this floor, so I went back a bit to a metamorphosis well and got a Scroll of Weapon Enchantment. I put it on my glaive, and it gave me Lucky enchant, which I was happy with. I was noticeably putting out much more damage (I could hit up to the 50s), and it was activating often because it was a +8 glaive. DM-300 was also a piece of cake. I just kept on slowing and stabbing DM-300 until he died.  Not much happened in the Dwarven City. I bought a weightstone and boosted the glaive's speed, to pair with my wand of slowness. The imp gave me a +3 ring, but it was one which helped with missiles.   The Dwarven King was actually a bit of a challenge, because I decided not to use my potions or scrolls much against him. I slowed him and got a few good hits in the start, but after that, I got mobbed by his skeletons. It still wasn't too much of a battle. I upgraded my (now) +4 plate armor and used a healing potion before leaving into the Demon Halls.  I hate the Demon Halls. On the floor 22, I thought, ""Yeah, I'm strong enough. I think I can explore the Demon Halls a bit rather than just running to the exit ASAP like last time.""  I pretty much ran as fast as I could to the exit each time. Luckily, my level was a bit higher than the floor number from the Dwarven City, so I didn't need/want to stay to farm exp anyways. Whenever, I encountered the Demon Eye, I just slowed and turned the corner or ran up to it and stabbed it to death as fast as I could. Scorpios were incredibly annoying because they were invisible.  When I reached Yog-Dzewa, I had a +9 glaive (I was a bit stupid and upgraded my glaive once more, which got rid of the Lucky enchantment) and a +4 plate armor turned Heroic Suit of Armor, along with a +2 wand of slowness, +1 ring of haste, and a wide selection of potions (with a few scrolls and no seeds). I had figured out a strategy this time, so I was ready to not be obliterated by Yog-Dzewa's fists. The fight was a bit anticlimatic. I just drank a potion of invisibility, hunkered down next to Yog-Dzewa (as its fists went the opposite direction) with an Earthroot seed, and poked it in the eye. A lot of larva spawned, but I had max armor and Earthroot, so each only did 0-1 damage for the most part. They also formed a protective huddle around me as Yog-Dzewa's fists panicked and cursed the larva, being unable to reach me. After I was set up, I just spam-clicked the eye until I won, and swept up some of the remaining larva. Yay!  I went down to the next floor and got the Amulet of Yendor. When the dialogue box popped up, for a second I thought the game wasn't over and I would have to fight my way out of the sewers against harder enemies. I looked it up and I realized that it allowed to walk up stairs. I decided to walk all the way up as a symbolic gesture. Still ran like a wimp past the Demon Halls, but then I enjoyed stomping on the mobs of the floors above.  The picture comes in when I reach floor 7. I saw an sprite flit away as I chased it, wanting to obliterate it into pulp. Way up here, eons ago, I had used a scroll of mirror image when trying to identify it. Since those scrolls are pretty rare, I forgot I ever used one until I came all the way back up. When I caught up to this shadowy figure, I remembered that it was my young self from decades ago, still wandering the halls of floor 7.   Unfortunately, I could not annihilate my mirror image because you can't attack mirror images anymore."

I wouldn't want to change the core idea you have for the challenge, however, so I want to make sure that the submission process you explained is an essential part of what the challenge is.  For example, is the screenshot requirement of all items laid down on a single floor just to help prove what the player has, or is it a necessary part of the challenge (the player is required to find a room suitable to fit all of the items inside)?

PixelDungeon,32e827,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"The main issue with that is that some strategies involve figuring out what items do what before using them (e.g. if you haven't IDed health potions, you can buy them for cheap from the store), with that change it would be impossible to know until they're Ided.

PixelDungeon,32e827,aushack,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"right, but your suggestion is to initially have all items look the same when unidentified.  Say a player finds only one potion in a level with a barricade, it's orange. He doesn't need to use it as he has a wand of fireblast, but now he knows that orange = liquid flame. If all un-IDed potions were black, all he would know is that one if his black potions is liquid flame, but keeping track of which one would be very annoying."
PixelDungeon,32byz2,darkwing_duck_87,2,Sun Apr 12 14:01:14 2015 UTC,"You'd basically have to start by developing heuristics that your AI uses to increase its expected utility.  For example, your AI needs to know that if there is an item in sight but an enemy within view, it needs to take actions that put the enemy at a higher priority than obtaining the item.  It's actually quite complicated but not impossible.  Your AI is going to have to recognize locked doors and what that means, if a door is locked your AI may run around the current level nonstop if it doesn't realize that the only way to get into the locked door is by dropping in through the previous floor.  There's a lot that goes into programming a decent AI."

PixelDungeon,32byz2,molivious,2,Mon Apr 13 01:38:49 2015 UTC,"In addition to mdskr...guy's post, thankfully, it would be much easier to analyze enemy AI thanks to the game being open source. This almost cuts your work (the guessing game, to be exact) by half. Still, it's a long process. You'll basically have to invest a lot of patience and time for analyzing every possible situation, more than the skills itself to put the playbot into action. It may take from a few weeks to a couple of months. Keep that in mind.  So, erm, what exactly do you mean ""what do I need to start?""? Do you mean, the tools you need? If so, here's a post (see comments) that walks you there. You should have an idea of what to do next once you get that set up.  P.S. take note that if you go with Eclipse, you will also have to download and install it's dedicated android IDE plugin separately. Some folks tend to miss this and get lost in the setup process."

PixelDungeon,329435,hpp3,4,Sat Apr 11 18:19:39 2015 UTC,Oh yes. Amok is a seriously underrated thing. My only sadness with amok is that the dwarf levels are pretty much immune to it. I'll say it until I'm blue in the face: debuffs are stronger than damage if you're being strategic. Trading damage with bad guys and drinking healing potions when needed is one of the worst strategies and is completely dependent on getting lucky and finding good gear.  Skillful item use is how you win on those more marginal runs.

PixelDungeon,31zy6a,Concani,2,Thu Apr 9 15:36:28 2015 UTC,Gladiator.
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,davidsverse,2,Thu Apr 9 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely gladiator, which allows you to outlast enemies with your increasingly high DPS. Also, it has no drawbacks and is applicable at all times whereas berserker runs the risk of dying and is only applicable when you drop low."
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,KatzOfficial,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"My opinion, I prefer the gladiator, Cause with the berserker you run the risk of being killed. And if you have a weapon that's lightened by the weight stone you're able to attack more frequently. so gladiator in my opinion."
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,Bleon582,2,Thu Apr 9 14:04:25 2015 UTC,I always used the stone all the way around .. what's your rationale?   is hitting faster with less damage (plus the increase in the chances of missing) worth of it?
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,molivious,2,Thu Apr 9 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"forgive me for jumping in, but I just wanted to give my two cents.  Speaking for myself, the choice is extremely situational. Generally, speed helps a lot IF the weapon is enchanted with damage-inducing effects (shocking, blazing, poisonous), as the loss of raw damage is compensated with the enchantment's DPS. Being a Gladiator and increasing stacks is a mere yummy bonus. Speed is also preferrable if the weapon's already accurate to begin with (Battle Axe / Hammer).   If none of the above conditions are met, it's all-in for Accuracy."
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,Bleon582,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:19:31 2015 UTC,More attacks=more damage with the gladiator
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,Tetsujidane,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"The trade-off works out even mathematically.  If you have a weapon that does base 20 damage (ideally) every time your opponent gets a move, it's not as good as a weapon that can do 30 damage every time your opponent gets a move. (Trade-off being 5 less damage per hit)"
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,molivious,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"Gladiator has no drawbacks, per se. But the Berserker, to make use of his perks, must be played at a risk. The damage bonus isn't even exactly that huge to begin with, although it is very much welcome, no doubt. I play Gladiator more often for the said reason."
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,valgrid,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:07:11 2015 UTC,Gladiator. Does damage on higher levels when you always have good health. Gets you faster to lower levels.
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:28:05 2015 UTC,"Gladiator is more universally useful. Berserker is situationally useful.  Sometimes, I'll wait a bit to see what gear I find before deciding. Accuracy items? Decent enchantments? Haste ring? Gladiator. Awesome armor, evasion ring (might/tenacity rings if playing shattered), berserker.  Honestly, the gladiator ability annoys me. Enemies block and dodge everything anyway. Getting 3+ hits in a row is pretty uncommon. But it's always there for you. Toward the end of the game, though, you spend a lot of time at 40% health. Every single one of those hits is enhanced, even if that stupid monk or golem blocks every other attack."
PixelDungeon,31zy6a,gillecave500,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"I like the gladiator because he can stack damage and that can help you in the early phase of the game but you need to make a 3 chain at least and sometimes you just can't, the berseker doesn't have that flaw. The berseker is really powerful, he can turn the game with a good weapon and low health, but you need to take care of your health more than the gladiator so i play it like a regular warrior. Although i like the gladiator i have no problem using the berseker, but the assassin is the best."

PixelDungeon,31yz56,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"The spellbook is one of my favorite artifacts! Fully upgraded, it's a source of free identify, remove curse, and magic mapping. You might even get a lucky recharge or lullaby. Since some of the scrolls are also offensive, I usually read it in front of bad guys. The only drawback is due to the chance of psionic blast, you don't want to use it while badly hurt. All it costs you to upgrade is some common scrolls.  Room full of monks and golems? Let's just start reading this thing until they're next to me."
PixelDungeon,31wc93,B_Boll,6,Wed Apr 8 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"Part of the balance of gear in the game is that low tier items DO suck late, it's necessary as the ideal is that you progress through gear as the game goes.  However, I do totally agree that there aren't enough cool things gear can do besides lend stats, and strength progression is too quick atm so earlygame gear feels extra weak."
PixelDungeon,31wc93,00-Evan,2,Wed Apr 8 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"My gear progression is basically T1 weapon -> maybe a T2 -> T5 packed with lot's of upscrolls. When I was able to use my long sword I already have a warhammer +2.  And more, the way it's now the only aspect of the weapons that is relevant is the damage. I'm a stealth rogue walking around on the shadows AND WILL SMASH YOUR FACE WITH THE WAR HAMMER!"
PixelDungeon,31wc93,00-Evan,3,Wed Apr 8 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"Well, part of that actually makes sense to me. I doesn't fit so well with the rogue archetype, and not all T5 weapons have to be big smashy things, but at the end of the day, if you can swing it well, a surprise attack with a big warhammer would be strictly better than one with daggers against a tough enemy, unless said daggers were magical or something.  Regardless, The current plan is for the eventual Shattered weapon/armor rework to feature new items for more variety, and a reworked strength system, the draft for which I posted a little while ago here: http://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/2tqxzr/degredation_in_shattered_pixel_dungeon/"
PixelDungeon,31wc93,hpp3,2,Wed Apr 8 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"If equipping random low level armor/weapons is meant to be encouraged, then the curse/remove curse needs to be changed. As it is now, equipping a cursed -2 mace is a run-ending mistake. I suggest one or more of the following changes: negative enchantment does not increase str requirement (it's unusually harsh that cursed gear is so debilitating, given that you probably will get str penalties on top of them being already bad), more common remove curse (in dungeon crawl stone soup, remove curse is an extremely abundant scroll, so the player should always have one, and they can be identified by how abundant they are), or remove the curse system entirely.   A somewhat related idea is to make being cursed inherently cause an item to drop 3 points of enchantment, which are restored when the curse is removed. So for example, in the current system a loot room gives me a cursed -2 ring of might. I can remove the curse, but it will take me 3 scrolls of upgrade to get this ring even close to usable, which is too steep a price. As such I'll end up discarding this ring, which is a shame. In my proposed scheme, the ring would be generated as cursed +1, which is treated as a -2 ring. When I do remove the curse though, the ring is actually usable. This of course depends on remove curse being scarce."

PixelDungeon,31wc93,Altiumbe,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"I hate to be an idea guy, but I would enjoy seeing curses work more like enchantments and less like run ending debuffs. It's been brought up that curses are boring, that they've been done more our less the same in every roguelike with little variation, and I  agree.  Instead of lowering the damage and raising the strength requirement, the could add small annoyances like a watered down scroll of challenge roaring every time the equipment gets used or complex effects like a chance of getting possessed by malevolent spirits when your health gets low.    That was longer than I expected. My apologies."
PixelDungeon,31wc93,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"What I've done with artifacts, and what I'm going to do with wands, is basically a litmus test for this sort of change. The goal is to make curses more about forcing an unfavourable gameplay alteration instead of simply giving a huge stat disadvantage. For weapons and armor this will likely take the form of new negative or double edged enchantments, as you suggest.  As had been mentioned, this is pretty necessary if I'm going to expect the player to take more risks by wearing more gear as they progress."
PixelDungeon,31wc93,00-Evan,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"Well, that way the weapons uses will vary for sure, but the decision making when you pick one or the other will be realy simple yet. I can use the weapon? If yes, choose the one with bigger tier.  If you desagree with the idea to buff low tier wepons, please consider to give the big damage one some debuff to make you need to wonder what weapon to use.  Increase the number of weapons and keep it as more damage = better is like no add weapons at all  (Please add weapons anyway, the non balance me would love to have more fantasy thinks to blast my foes faces!)"
PixelDungeon,31wc93,ThunfischGott,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"The ideal will be that there can be some decision making inside of a tier, but yes in most cases a higher tier item will always beat out a lower tier one if you have the strength. Still, strength changes will encourage investment in lower tiers in order to survive in the earier game stages, which may force some decisions.  Generally I like to promote strategy and decision making additions, but it doesn't mean it's always appropriate. Turning everything into a decision risks making the game too complex. I like adding some decision making to weapons/armor, but it won't be as much as in other places."
PixelDungeon,31wc93,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:28:12 2015 UTC,In some other thread you mentioned a way to rework weapons by increasing the strentgh requirements of high tier weapons a lot so they become truly late game.  I liked the idea whats about it ?

As for rings and wands, each tier corresponds to 2levels. Eg tier 2 is for upgrading +3 or +4. For nonupgraded items/armour/weapons, any tier would work.  This would in effect do what watabou intended to do with item degradation.  Tho you have plans for rehauling stuff, no harm considering."
PixelDungeon,31wc93,BilbolDev,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:45:08 2015 UTC,I dont like it Well extra abilitys on weapons is something that i would always vote for but the idea that early game weapons are superior in late game sucks if you ask me I dont like the knuckleduster beeing a good late game weapon on classes other than gladiator too. This just dumbs down the game so that you just stick to your starting gear or stuff found on level 1. There would be no reasons to go for higher tiered weapons if the low tiers were good in late game. The Thrill of finding new good weapons woikd be gone. No more YAY I GOT A GLAIVE FROM GHOST just erm finished the game with level 15 knuckle duster.

PixelDungeon,31rqk5,WaZ606,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:15:30 2015 UTC,Hmmm you will die often in level 1-5 even in later game either you get good equipment ore you are dead you will get past 5 maybe every third game if you are good.  -If there is something on your stage that you can only get with specific stuff (wood barricades need to be burnt down with fire potions) there will be one of those on your level (in this case a fire potion)  -every stage has as many doors as it has keys dont rush down as soon as you find the stairs explore the whole stage -farm healthpots with flies -dont equip unidentifies stuff curses will fuck you op -do the ghost quests ALWAYS and take armor if you dont have a good armor already -you can put a scroll into your start weapon you cab always disenchant it to upgrade one of your good late game weapons  That was everything that came to my mind on the spot good luck if you want more help i need to know to what you are usually dieing ad what class you play Edit: RIP my formating fuck mobile reddit

PixelDungeon,31qx3r,00-Evan,2,Tue Apr 7 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, is buying wands in the shop a waste of money? That is, assuming that you're not desperate for a wand for some reason.  The only time I bought one in a shop it was a wand of firebolt which was nice, only 750g too. I kind of hoped that spending that much gold on one would ensure I get a good one.  Thats probably not true though..."
PixelDungeon,31qx3r,Sappin,3,Tue Apr 7 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Everything in pixel mart is a ripoff, it's sort of a joke within the game that due to the circumstances the shopkeeper can get away with charging outrageous prices.   The high value wands/rings/artifacts the shopkeeper occasionally stocks can be a big risk, but if you really want one it can totally be worth it."

PixelDungeon,31qx3r,Sappin,2,Tue Apr 7 17:59:35 2015 UTC,750 gold for a scroll of terror my ass
PixelDungeon,31qx3r,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:26:58 2015 UTC,"I'd counter that nothing in the shop is a ripoff, because gold is abundant, and there's absolutely nothing else to spend it on. Some items are obviously a higher priority than others (e.g., container, healing pots, food, map/curse/ID scrolls). But if I pay 1500 gold and that wand's a firebolt, half a dozen upgrade scrolls later I've won the game.  The weapons and armor are generally crap. They should have the same random chance of being 0 to +3, with a small random chance of enchantment, just like items you find (but priced appropriately if they are). I'd buy the off-chance +3 unstable sword I come across, but I've never, ever bought one of the plain jane weapons or armor from a shop."
PixelDungeon,31qx3r,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"When I say ripoff I don't mean within the actual balance of the game, but rather in the context of the world that PD takes place in.   Surely if a great hero would get around 10,000 gold from plundering a dungeon that houses an ancient god and an amulet of vast power, nobody in their right mind would normally pay several hundred gold for an undersized ration of food.  I like to assume that the gold you get from selling things is roughly what those items are worth on the surface. The code supports there, where an item's 'value' attribute is given in the same numbers as you sell them, and then the shops charge 10-25 times that, depending on how deep you are."
PixelDungeon,31qx3r,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:24:45 2015 UTC,"Considering that a wand of firebolt is essentially a portable, reusable nuclear warhead, I'd say a peasant out in the real world would consider it a steal at 1500 gold."
PixelDungeon,31qx3r,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:44:45 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that 1500 isn't peasant money, more like a decent chunk of a king's coffers. Also that wand isn't upgraded, and it's going to be losing its hand-held nuke status at least somewhat in the next update.  But yes, certainly some items are larger ripoffs than others."

It doesn't work everytime but in general it does. I guess it's luck related based on the weapon he's holding. Try standing on water and drinking them potions. That's how I identify my potions. It might not be ideal but it's the best way I see. Even if it's a burn you're on water so minimal damage. If one of those two potion kinds you have there was healing. Well that was your answer, use the healing potion :)"
PixelDungeon,31q05f,BilbolDev,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:25:27 2015 UTC,Don't stand on water. Stand next to water so you don't get paralyzed from frost.
PixelDungeon,31q05f,hpp3,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"I would actually try for it.   Throw an earthroot down in water next to him and proceed whacking. If you weren't warrior, I would suggest skipping it till later."
PixelDungeon,31q05f,gohjohn,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:28:30 2015 UTC,"Stand in the doorway. Plant earthroot just outside the door. Read each scroll (one is probably upgrade - use it on your sword obviously, but others may hinder the statue).  One of those two kinds of potions is most likely healing. Probably white. Hope you're feeling lucky. If one of those scrolls turns out to be identify, ID the blue potions. If they're toxic/paralysis/liquid flame, that's one more thing to bother him with.  Toss your darts until he's next to you. Oh. You're out of darts. Never mind. Hit him once then step outside on to the earthroot and take a free lick on him in the doorway. Fight him until earthroot is gone, then move, hitting him once on the other side of each door, hoping you get lucky. You probably won't. Warhammer's an accurate weapon, but if things work out, maybe you'll do enough damage before he's next to you to get him dead with your sword before he gets you. If the level is set up for it, plant your second earthroot past the next closest door you're going to lead him through.  What's the ring? If it's evasion or maybe might, stick with what I said above. If it's haste, even better. Run like the wind and pick at him until you're out of darts (edit: never mind - noticed you were out), then do the door thing. If it's furor or accuracy, maybe plant earthroot #2 next to earthroot #1, put on that chain armor, duke it out until earthroot #1 is gone, move to earthroot #2, and keep at it. If it's anything else, crapshoot.  Get healed to full health first, obviously. If you haven't picked through the whole floor yet, case the place for seeds, dew, items, etc. Maybe even go through level 4, too, then come back up. Just to get a few more seeds or other items in your arsenal and go up another level or so."

PixelDungeon,31lsqf,BilbolDev,7,Mon Apr 6 07:07:58 2015 UTC,"I downloaded it and tried it out a few floors; a few random thoughts:   I generally like the idea of active and passive abilities, but not the way it's executed. Having to go into a separate menu to active your abilities is a bit bothersome (4 taps!). Whenever I use a remote bomb, the next time an enemy attacks me it attacks 3 times in a row; don't know what's up with that. I like the idea of a bow and arrow, but I don't like having to equip it and forego my melee weapon, only to have to equip it again when mobs come into melee range, which happens often (or does it work without penalties close-range?). Also, 3 inventory slots—ouch! The bomb arrow consumes all 10 charges with 1 attack. The warrior's Smite debuff seems to last quite long, and really hurts you in a way that it's worth using (at least not at earlier levels, especially seeing as rats respawn into zombies). Having to set a quick slot each time I load or start a new game is annoying. Also, it resets after every floor.. A zombie rat went to sleep at one point (not sure how, I think remote bomb) and I moved onto his tile instead of attacking him.   I'm sure some of these things are unintentional, but at this point it's not as clean and worked-out as I'd like it to be to play this instead of the original one or Shattered.  Nonetheless, I do think you have some great ideas and I appreciate the development behind them. I also hope you'll continue to work on it, cause it does have potential in my view."
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,DeathWise,3,Mon Apr 6 10:18:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. I'll see what I can do about activating skills (holding down on a mob shows a small window perhaps?). Along with the draw backs and cool downs. As for the Bow, arrows are stronger than darts so they have to come at a disadvantage. The disadvantage (at the moment) is having to reequip melee. 3 inventories is Bow, Arrows and Bomb arrow. If you use the bomb arrow it becomes two :). Maybe the bow can be equipped like rings? removing the equip and reequip and saving a slot.  I'll have to rework the disadvantage though. The 10 charges on the bomb arrow? I think you are confusing required strength for number of bomb arrows :).  Zombie rats going to sleep looks like a minor AI bug, I will into that thank you for reporting.  Many thanks for your honest reply and I do have a lot of ideas, I try to have every update come with something 'unique'. Ie not just another item update."

PixelDungeon,31lsqf,SariusDev,2,Mon Apr 6 09:57:12 2015 UTC,"That's fun, I was going to post about this mod today and saw your post !  I played it this weekend and it was refreshing, but maybe a bit easy with mage or huntress : you'll never die if you take your time, because of the infinite seeds and meat.  After winning easily in Hard Mode, I tried the Huntress/Sniper suicide mode, and it was a blast :D  It's been a while since I raged because of a stupid death in Pixel Dungeon : I was in the drawven city with a lot of stuff and a wand of herbalism, so I could just take my time and refill ad-nauseam my vial in case of bad encounter. With the hunting skill at 2, I had more than enough food to never be hungry and regen all my life while sleeping (preferably in a quiet place, like a boss level). My plan was to just farm a little more, get to level 21, then skip the dungeon hall and win with my invisilibity potions. Everything was fine... Except that I went to sleep and in the morning, still not fully awake, I made the mistake of continuing the game... I lost all my 3 hours progress in 20 seconds, because Suicide mode is, in fact, unforgiving.  Thanks a lot for this mod, I'll continue playing it, it's a refreshing challenge."
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,roastedlasagna,1 point,Tue Apr 7 09:18:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback :). Passive skills (mainly the mage's herbalism and the huntress's hunting) will be reworked in the next update. The skills do make the hero's stronger and given that I did not improve the strength of mobs (in normal) the game did get easier. I can see hard being the same as PD or ShatteredPD normal. Give hell a shot, it's a good balance. Suicide is suicide :P"
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,roastedlasagna,2,Tue Apr 7 10:01:12 2015 UTC,"So far, I'm really impressed with the ideas. For one, adding skills just opened more doors into improving the ""RPG"" element of the game, and making each character more unique and distinct from each other. However, I have some issues with it:   I find 2 skill points per level way too much...for the easier modes. Perhaps reduce it to 1 point for Easy to Hard instead of reworking the skills themselves. Rogue gets REALLY meh compared to the others. This ""imbalance"" becomes more apparent when playing in the more difficult modes: The Warrior, Mage, and Huntress last much longer thanks to their passives alone, but the Rogue will only do so thanks to being a Freerunner, and not because of his passives. Max stealth helps, but if you keep avoiding enemies, you will fall in levels, resulting in so much HP disadvantage -- which you can't afford in the likes of Suicide mode. While the other classes benefit from stat boosts and preservation skills, the rogue merely gets mere bonuses in utility (additional gold to buy an extra potion or two isn't really that helpful either as compared to reducing enemy damage, or constant healing throughout the dungeon).    As a suggestion: Haste or Mending (see the rings' effects) are passives that would help the Rogue class, as a whole (making Assassin actually usable). It would probably make him broken if you directly copy the rings' codes, but with some tweaks (1/3rd the amount seems like a good base), it will probably work. Get rid of stealth, really.  Disarm trap is also near...useless, considering that it ""resets"" or disables itself, despite being activated, after you move to the next floor. There are also hundreds of traps in a single dungeon, blocking 10 or so almost means nothing. Something like a temporary Magic Mapping, or seeing all enemies on the floor (a bit longer than the scroll), will be more helpful."
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,JadElClemens,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:49:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for suggestions. Originally the rogue had a 'Lay Trap' not a 'Disable Trap' which was really cool. Unfortunately mobs simply didn't step on them. The rogue does indeed need some rework. Shadow clone is great, basically a built in 1/4 mirror scroll thing. Perhaps give him the invisibility skill the huntress used to have? As for passive skills perhaps make trap disable passive? every point gives you 10% chance of disabling. 10 points = trap immunity. Very powerful but I am sure not OPed. Venom is quite nice, gives your attacks extra damage. That leaves stealth, I thought it was a nice companion for the assasin but it can take you so far.. I guess I can put something related to haste instead of it. I will check. PS: how do you add new lines here lol"
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,DeathWise,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Rogue is that he doesn't scale well in the more difficult modes. He easily falls behind and dies quickly, because all that he could really do is run away. The dwarves (mage/monk) obliterate him so easily, for example. Freerunners could still manage to get away, but the Assassin has no chance at making any kind of advantage for himself. Not even doors and his special could save him...and it only gets worse IF you manage to beat the dwarven king. Other classes' passives provide so much sustain (increased stats, more food, etc), helpful for reaching lower depths, while all the Rogue can do is run around, avoiding enemies. It needs so much effort (running around isn't easy, either) to even get to the 4th boss on suicide. :I  The idea you have regarding invisibility is good, but it still doesn't fix the Rogue's scaling issue. The idea with traps, however, actually sounds great. Just give it 5% per point, though. 100% immunity as early as level 10 is kind of OP. Having something like 50-80% chance by the end isn't that bad anyway -- not all traps are actually lethal in the first place.   Now if you give the Rogue the Dualswords (or something similar) as their starting item, along with everything you just mentioned above, then that may actually work. No need for haste or mending. That item's great for proc'ing his Venom passive (and pretty OP on Berserkers and especially Gladiators lol).  (What do you mean add new lines?)"

As for using PD code for another app, my best guess is that you would need to make the modified parts open source, but your own code could remain private. However, I would recommend contacting Watabou to ask him about it. I would bet that he would be fine with it as long as you explain the situation to him. And If you're going to try and make money off code that he wrote, you DEFINITELY should contact him. When Pixel Maze came out (a PD clone that sold for $0.99 on the Play Store), Watabou didn't like that at all.  So TLDR for your question is to contact Watabou."

PixelDungeon,31lsqf,petrichor420,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:48:37 2015 UTC,Thanks :) In 0.1.6 the version freebie is just a Frost Bow. So no more clutter :P
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,Kultissim,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"I am really enjoying playing this mod, thanks for releasing it.  Can I suggest that you change the in game options icon (like shattered) so we can quickly differentiate from other mods in screen shots? Perhaps you could change its color to purple?  I would really like to add a scrolling inventory (whilst keeping the tabs) to PD. Do you think this would change the game in a negative way?"
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,GreekBen,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:05:50 2015 UTC,scrolling inventory? not sure what you mean
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,SandsnakePrime,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:13:12 2015 UTC,I mean an inventory that can contain more than the onscreen items that are accessed by swiping up to reveal items off screen. Like any scroll container.
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,Operative_Bane,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"I just downloaded and I love it. It definitely has the potential to be the best version of PD. It would be cool if you could implement the artifacts. Also, if you could add a description of what the passives do in the game somewhere so that we wouldn't have to look at the play store site, although that's a minor gripe."
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,Operative_Bane,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, so I downloaded it yesterday and beat it with every character in a couple different difficulties (not the hardest yet, cause damn, it's hard). It's really great so far, and it's definitely a lot of fun.   I do have a couple of suggestions:   Huntress having both a bow and a boomerang doesn't make much sense, maybe just remove the boomerang altogether and have the bow exclusive to huntress? That would also free up space for the other characters. I love the new weapons, but I think they're a bit too wimpy. The bombs and detonator are kind of cluttery, but I'm not sure what could be done about that. A potion pouch (like Shattereds) would be amazing. Actually, if you could collaborate with the Shattered dev somehow, you guys could make the absolute best game on a phone.   I really hope to see more from you, this is an amazing mod"
PixelDungeon,31lsqf,IJustKnowStuff,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:51:30 2015 UTC,"Several bugs related to death.  As warrior if you have skill points remaining, you can get additional hp even after you die from the endurance skill, and the monsters can kill you a second time even though you can not move.  Also you can hit continue to destination after you die, but again you can't control anything else.  You can also activate an active skill while dead which crashes the game."

PixelDungeon,31kyy6,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:53:34 2015 UTC,"that's not totally true, as health is the most common random potion. You could farm for a bit and realistically get a fair number of health pots.  remember though that farming has been nerfed in shattered, so after a few health pots they'll start getting less likely ;)"

PixelDungeon,31j9q8,Atomicpsycho,4,Sun Apr 5 18:24:53 2015 UTC,A lot of people moved to shattered because they got bored with the original and even more moved when the item degradation came in.
PixelDungeon,31j9q8,TeutorixAleria,7,Sun Apr 5 18:27:23 2015 UTC,Yeah that's fine for you. For me and many others the way the item degradation works just makes the game a slow grind. Constantly checking your items is a horrible chore not a fun gameplay mechanic.
PixelDungeon,31j9q8,TeutorixAleria,3,Sun Apr 5 18:34:52 2015 UTC,Theyre both good in their own way. I suggest you give shattered a shot.
PixelDungeon,31j9q8,JoshuMertens,2,Sun Apr 5 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"Shattered has more content than OG PD. It also doesn't have item degradation, which was a huge point of contention in the community, though it was very obviously implemented so that everyone wasn't just running insane glass cannon builds anymore. To be honest, people started gravitating to Shattered because the original is harder because of the item degradation. This isn't to discount the work that either dev has done on either game, they're both excellent experiences, but Shattered is more approachable to people who want a bit less feeling-punched-in-the-stomach with their brutal difficulty. Shattered also has different things from OG PD in both changed things like rings and scrolls and in artifacts, which only exist in OG PD as far as you can call the dew vial and Lloyd's Beacon artifacts. The minor bits of class rebalance feel good, like how the Rogue starts with a Cloak of Shadows that gives short bursts of invisibility before it has to recharge so you can properly take advantage of the class's skills."
PixelDungeon,31j9q8,greater_nemo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"I'm part of the bandwagon that abandoned ship after item degradation came in. Shattered is pretty similar apart from that, a few rebalances, artifacts, and the ghost's quest. Much more fun imo."

PixelDungeon,31he0e,MidgarZolom,5,Sun Apr 5 06:23:00 2015 UTC,Room blocked by bookshelf? Fire potion is somewhere on the floor.  Bottomless pit room with item? Levitation is somewhere.  Piranha room? Invisibility is somewhere.  Trap floor room? Either a levitation potion or more rarely the.... lack of smell potion. I can't recall its name for some reason.  Use this to help you figure out what potions and such are what early on.
PixelDungeon,31he0e,Zoralink,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:27:31 2015 UTC,Same here. Problem is if more than one kind of room spawns on a floor.   That one run where you drink a LF potion right in front of the piranas.

PixelDungeon,31gpp8,resmirandalee,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"Throw seeds in front of enemies and watch what each one does. Seeds of sungrass will heal you but you need to stand on it for many turns for it to work. Seeds of earthroot increase your defense a ton, but only if you stand still on it.  If you see a room with water and three fish swimming around, don't go in. You will get turned into fish chow. Levels that have this room also have a potion of invisibility somewhere. Use that to get across to the treasure.  Keep using scrolls of upgrade on your main weapon, unless you found a high tier armor that you really would like to use.  If you're playing original PD instead of Shattered PD, DON'T use scrolls of upgrade until the item durability is at its lowest. Likewise, scrolls of enchantment (only on original) will repair your gear. Save them for repairing.  Throw your strength potions into wells of transmutation (the wells with butterflies) to get +1 str and +5 hit point potions of might. In original, throw scrolls of enchantment into the well to get scrolls of upgrade.  Don't try and drink unidentified potions until you're sure there's no piranha room on the level you found the potion on.  Don't try and drink unidentified potions until you are standing in a puddle of water, as there's a chance it could burst into flames. Also, throw your scrolls far away from you before you drink unidentified potions.  Don't read unidentified scrolls until you're at a new level that's unexplored, because the scroll might be a magic mapping scroll.

PixelDungeon,31erzs,aushack,2,Sat Apr 4 11:11:06 2015 UTC,"So the talisman will let you ""scry"" after it has fully charged - this ability reveals all items on a level (kinda like stepping on the information well). This is fairly useful, but my favourite aspect of the talisman is that it detects traps near you: when you get within a couple steps of a trap, you'll get a ""you feel uneasy"" message (kinda like the ""you feel hungry"" message). This means you should start searching for traps around you.  The horn of plenty will stockpile food over time. Feed it your rations and it will do it faster and faster, until you no longer need to look for food. You can also feed it chargrilled meat, but (if I remember right) you need 3 pieces of meat to make 1 ration.  The chalice will increase your regen rate. A +10 chalice means you regen 2hp every turn no matter what - essentially, it means that rations are health potions. Combine that with the horn of plenty, and you're more or less unstoppable.  The hourglass has a couple really nice uses:   stasis makes you totally invincible for a few turns (good if you're in trouble) time freeze means you can get yourself out of tricky situations   It's a good get out of jail free card. If someone has some less 'passive' uses for it (I've only picked it up once or twice) then I'm all ears.  TL;DR: Horn + Chalice"
PixelDungeon,31erzs,killerkebab,2,Sat Apr 4 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"In the end I managed a +9 chalice (seem to always use my dew / ankh when I donate blood), with the +10 ring of furor. I managed to get the horn to +7 but found it boring (I like eating). Managed a +5 longsword with chilling enchantment which was doing average 60 damage per hit, and a +6 scale of viscosity. Also had the cape of thorns, but yeah never used it or the hourglass or the talisman or horn. Anyway yeah interesting mod."

So I have a +3 longsword weighted heavier, with a +6 ring of furor, and a cloth armour (lol).  I read briefly about the objects but haven't really used them:   I found the umm talisman, which I worked out you equip and it gets to 100%. Fair enough. I have the chalice, which I found in a prior run but killed myself immediately (prick #3 in a row - apparently not a smart idea on L1). Horn, so if you equip it is eventually becomes 10/10 which is the same as a standard ration? Also I need to sacrifice it food to increase the level? Hourglass, haven't used it but have been buying sand. Any good use for it?   Is it normal to find all these in a single game?

So you win a warrior run at 0, and -1 becomes available, then -2 etc (or +) until it is bloody impossible to finish level 1. Originally, my suggestion was to make the monsters 150% HP and 150% damage, then 200% etc etc. He mentioned a lot of the game balance was related to this before publishing the code, and I can see why. In the end, I made my own version where as first stated, the hero is (for me) too weak to even hold a sword and it is a massive hiding door battle to level up, and 2 rat bites would kill you. I liked it but I probably wouldn't recommend this method. I did play around with the monster HP = x (*1.5) for the 150% etc, which works okay but things like crabs are just too much. Anyway, thought I'd mention it."

PixelDungeon,31csnp,Tetsujidane,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:53:13 2015 UTC,My ideas for the trek back: All mobs that are still sleeping (that you snuck past or whatever) are now awake. All mobs on a floor now know exactly where you are at all times and actively pathfind to come to you. Any mobs standing next to you when you go up a flight of stairs follow. (Last one was stolen from DCSS.)  Alternatives: Bosses are revived. Yog is waiting for you on first floor's stairwell going out and he's pissed.

In return, the amulet can give you a powerful bonus to your weapon and stats to help you out.   The only problem i see is this. It seems to be a lot of work for a feature that not many people will see given that you must actually beat Yog and it is already hard enough getting to level 25."

I think this was way back before there was even a Rat King.   I think that the cursed amulet is a promising idea. Perhaps it just renders your weapons useless, or reconfigured your potions so you no longer know what you are carrying.  Perhaps it isn't cursed at all, but acts as a beacon, as if you were continuously reading a scroll of rage.   There are a lot of different directions one could go with this. Some of the ideas that are more fun are much harder to implement such as a new ""back way"" out and/or new mobs."
PixelDungeon,31csnp,khondrych,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:48:30 2015 UTC,Amulet already is a perma rage scroll. It doesn't matter so much as you can one-hit most enemies in the earlier stages.

Hope you're stocked up on healing potions and have a full dew vial. You're a freerunner, so if you're fed, you can put some distance between you and the bad guys.  The only thing you can't do that you might have done normally is stand there and duke it out hit for hit with the fighting hand.

PixelDungeon,31cr8e,PenguineCommando7,2,Sat Apr 4 21:42:49 2015 UTC,"Goo is easy in shattered, since you have a maze to run around in with him. Just do the door thing. Earthroot seeds are somewhat nerfed. So really, just do the door thing.  Artifacts can be cursed (so don't rush to equip all of them willy-nilly), but unlike other items, they can't be degraded. So after a remove curse scroll (or a health well if you have the cursed thing equipped), they're a regular powerful artifact.  Ring of haste is just for running in shattered. It's the ring of furor you want for fast attacks.  The dew vial is nerfed. It still functions as a refillable healing potion, but to get the auto-revive, you have to buy an ankh and bless the ankh with the full dew vial. Repeat as needed.  Use your offensive items. One of the common reasons people die is because they're stingy. Those seeds and offensive potions and scrolls and special ranged weapons are for throwing around liberally so you eat less damage. Trading hits and drinking healing potions as needed is not a good strategy. It works if you have a good run and get good gear, but there's one of you, a limited amount of resources to find, and an unlimited number of monsters.  With the exception of the overpowered firebolt wand, non-battle wands are generally better. People just don't know it. Slow and amok wands will save you a lot more grief than damage-dealing wands if you play smart.  Play smart and strategically. Every step counts. Use doors, know where water is, don't hesitate to search for traps - it's worth the extra time, prop open doors with items instead of charging through when you're low on health.  Food and health are both resources. Save your food until you need it instead of just chowing down every time you hit starvation."
PixelDungeon,31cr8e,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"The dew vial is nerfed.    Yeah I found this out while fighting the Burning Fist, and I still had 9 healing potions left.

I'm generally glad I got Shattered, really makes the game feel new"
PixelDungeon,3171qo,bigDon_001,13,Thu Apr 2 14:35:56 2015 UTC,I'll vote if there will be no degradation.
PixelDungeon,3171qo,Scharnvirk,7,Thu Apr 2 15:50:45 2015 UTC,Ok guys let's do this! For the Rat King!
PixelDungeon,3171qo,DerTanni,5,Thu Apr 2 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"/u/00-evan, you have any plans to support a steam release of some kind for shattered?"
PixelDungeon,3171qo,00-Evan,9,Thu Apr 2 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not anytime soon.  This is not a comment on regular PD as I have no idea what work may have been done on it outside of the open source repo, but it's my opinion that the desktop version of Shattered is not ready for a proper release.  There are several desktop-specific issues I want to tackle before I feel that Shattered on Desktop is ready for distribution. In its current state it's missing some basic desktop usability features (which I am slowly adding in, like holding direction keys to move), it doesn't handle desktop specific issues like file permissions very well, and while the update notifier on the JAR is a great step in the right direction, it should really have proper platform-specific installers. I worry that if Shattered Desktop in its current form were released to an audience of more than a couple hundred people there would be a massive number of users with issues.  This is in addition to my desire to have more content updates finished before I distribute on a platform like steam as well. Shattered holds up fine as a mobile game atm but I want to have more content on offer before I feel it's competitive as a desktop game, free or otherwise."
PixelDungeon,3171qo,syd430,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Will we ever see a version for iOS?  You could justifiably charge for it too, to cover the $99/year dev account. It's fairly standard to charge for an iOS app even when the Android counterpart is free. I would gladly pay for it, and I don't think many people would have any qualms about it either."
PixelDungeon,3171qo,ryanfranke,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:56:04 2015 UTC,It turns out it would be hard to port it in to IOS
PixelDungeon,3171qo,syd430,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:42:03 2015 UTC,"That's not the Shattered developer, also there's a working port already on github for vanilla PD. I remember sifting through it a while back."
PixelDungeon,3171qo,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"so the GDX port makes it much easier to port to iOS, but there are further complications.  Firstly, Apple and GPLv3 do not get along, so there are legal complications, which may require talks with everyone involved in PD and PG-GDX to allow shattered to operate independently of that licence.  Secondly, I do not have any iOS devices to test the game on, though thanks to donations that isn't as big of an issue. Still, donation money spent on that is money not spent elsewhere.  lastly, once I have some devices to test on, i'll need to invest dev time into fixing platform specific issues, and adapt my current build/distribution schedule to account for the new platform.  This is all stuff I will hopefully do eventually, but as I want to focus on beefing up content right now it may not be soon.  EDIT: oh, and I will never ever charge for Shattered PD if there is another option. Donations will more than cover the 99/yr cost. Even on a platform like steam I would investigate offering the game for free and doing donations through steam before considering making it paid."

Apart from that, kite him as much as possible using ranged weapons and seeds, and just attack him twice or so and then move one space away and attack again. That way you avoid taking damage from the toxic gas."
PixelDungeon,31862w,DerTanni,3,Fri Apr 3 01:57:19 2015 UTC,this. plan movement accordingly and dont let him heal

PixelDungeon,31862w,NeedWittyUsername,2,Fri Apr 3 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Hit it then move away diagonally to avoid the gas. Don't let it repair itself (by standing on a trap thing). Also helps if you can put bad effects on it e.g. Javelin, Fire, Poison, Slow etc."
PixelDungeon,31862w,hpp3,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:21:10 2015 UTC,"There are a few things to watch out for. When he moves, he randomly causes an avalanche effect that will stun you if it hits you. If you get stunned, it usually means a very quick death. He also has a cloud of gas near him at all times, and he hits pretty hard in melee combat. If he moves over one of those disabled traps on the ground, he will heal. So to avoid the stun, just don't let him move. Fight him in one spot and stand your ground. I find that if you try to alternate attacks and moves in order to dodge the gas, you'll just end up stunned and die. If you have earthroot or purification you can negate that portion of his damage. If you have both, he's a very easy fight."
PixelDungeon,318g5r,MoronLessOff,2,Thu Apr 2 20:49:53 2015 UTC,The irony...
PixelDungeon,318g5r,ryanfranke,2,Fri Apr 3 05:12:24 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I've read your armor and buffs reduce damage the chalice causes
PixelDungeon,318g5r,caveman8284,3,Fri Apr 3 11:33:53 2015 UTC,"Going from 9 to 10 does enormous (243) damage, and a hero at level 26 has only 145hp.  Armor mitigates, but the amount mitigated is random between 1 and the maximum amount, so it helps with total cost as you go through the upgrade cycle, but doesn't guarantee survival.   An earthroot seed is what I usually use. Earthroot creates a half-damage-absorbing bubble equal to the maximum hp of the hero. This means even if your armor trolls you by rolling a 1 for mitigation, you can still cap the chalice as early as level 22 (125hp x 2 = 250 > 243).  Using ankh(s) you could cap even sooner.

PixelDungeon,314r45,noobtablet9,3,Thu Apr 2 00:07:04 2015 UTC,"I think there's a fairly reasonable argument for disabling the button if your chance to steal is 0%, but for the most part I'm not too eager to add warnings to everything."
PixelDungeon,314r45,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"There really should be a warning for walking on traps you already know are there (can see them), though. That's flawed design, if we get warning for chasms but not traps we can see. Should be the same."
PixelDungeon,314r45,cranialAnalyst,2,Thu Apr 2 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"Chasms are much more common than traps, and have a much larger negative impact.  While yes walking onto both should be considered a 'fat finger' move, I don't think it's necessary that every single mistap be prevented. accidentally walking into traps can easily happen as a lack of mindfulness, something the player should be punished for. When a player is surrounded by chasms on all sides and it is very easy to mistap, it becomes more of a gotcha moment.  In addition, warnings and 'are you sure' dialogs are considered by some to be hand holding, and too many become cumbersome. They should be reserved for the more high-impact scenarios."
PixelDungeon,314r45,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"If a player is tapping to move to a square, and he sees traps, he will either avoid them automatically or not move if traps completely block the path. The only scenario in which a player will walk onto a seen trap is the same as if he walks into a chasm. The game is turn-based; we take all the time we need. But in both cases it can happen that we misclick. This has nothing to do with mindfulness, since we can take all the time we need. It has much more to do with being forgiving on fingers (in my case, overly calloused).  It's arbitrary to state that chasms are more common than traps, since most floors have traps impeding movement in corridors and rooms etc, and aren't the type that have lots of chasms. And even on floors with lots of chasms, there are traps as well...  Also, are chasms really numerically that much more of a negative effect? You can just as easily die from all manner of traps or lose important scrolls/potions. I'd say they're pretty close to equal in how they badly effect character. I think you're making an arbitrary distinction again.  These things should be treated the same. It's inconsistent, otherwise."
PixelDungeon,314r45,cranialAnalyst,2,Thu Apr 2 19:41:50 2015 UTC,"Chasms have an entire level layout dedicated to them, in which players have to tap over thin walkways. There is no equivalent for traps and infact that level layout is what prompted chasms to get the warning, they did not have one initially.  Chasms also deal ~half of your max HP in damage, more than any trap unless it is very early in the game, and they displace the character into another floor. Chasms also cannot be disarmed like traps using thrown items.  Traps are meant as a means of adding some variance to the game and to punish players who don't take reasonable steps to avoid them. They are a hostile entity within the game. In contrast pits don't exist specifically to have the player trip into them, although the threat of falling is the focus of the gameplay they offer.  I appreciate that it sucks to accidentally walk onto a trap, but I don't view it as a consistency issue as the two, while similar in some ways, are different in their impact if triggered, rate of occurrence, and their intention for gameplay.  If you frequently trigger traps without meaning too, I'd suggest disarming them before trying to walk past."
PixelDungeon,314r45,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the armband already tell you your percent chance when you go to buy/steal an item and have to choose? I mean, if you don't bother reading that window and just push the steal button, what's going to make you read the next one that pops up? Maybe you'll just push the button then, too.  Sometimes, I get caught up in a fight, I'm not paying the best attention, I'm low on health, I have healing potions, but I don't drink them. I just hit attack again without thinking, and the monster kills me. If your health is below X percent, you have a healing potion, and a monster is right next to you, should you get a prompt warning you when you try to attack instead of drinking your healing potion?  Sometimes, I hit the wrong spot in my inventory and equip the wrong item, and it turns out to be cursed. If you click on an unidentified item, should you get a prompt warning you that the item might be cursed and asking you to confirm?  Just today, I had the talisman artifact, I got the ""you feel uneasy"" message, but I wasn't paying attention, walked into a fire trap, and burned an upgrade scroll. If you try to walk instead of search when you get that message, should you get a prompt asking you if you're sure?"
PixelDungeon,314r45,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"I saw there was a 0% chance. I meant to press buy and I press steal on accident. I'm just saying it would be nice to have a warning to prevent that from happening, it doesn't seem like it would be hard to implement.  And holy shit dude I'm not asking for warnings on everything, but this doesn't realy affect gameplay much and it's just to prevent fat-finger mistakes like how you stop moving if you're running and being attacked by someone like a gnoll shaman. In Pixel Dungeon you just keep running and usually die but in shattered you get stopped."

The elder god Watabou also crowned him as the official king of the sewers, and gave him a magnificent throne room to live in with lots of amazing treasure. In fact, the only reason RAT KING is so powerful is because he was blessed by Watabou. Otherwise, he would have remained a minor character, forgotten by everyone.

You may not have been lurking here yet, but when the RAT KING made it into the game proper, I lost my goddamn mind. /u/roastedlasagna didn't say anything to me about celebrating the RAT KING's birthday, but as co-creator of the RAT KING mythos, no one was more qualified to make the call than him, and it pleases me to no end to see the old code dusted off the shelf for another April Fool's. To anyone who's interested, I wrote the CSS to set all this up last year and left it in the sub stylesheet in the section called SECRAT CRAP.    To be perfectly honest, I always felt like the RAT KING should give you the option to fight him for some other special reward once you've acquired the amulet and head back up to the surface. Maybe the key to the door in the amulet room? :D    Also thanks for giving the RAT KING some love <3"

PixelDungeon,30t2k9,hambugerface,9,Mon Mar 30 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"I've got a pretty similar opinion of degradation, I think the balancing and challenge are great, but the mechanic itself is just unfun and can often punish unfairly.

PixelDungeon,30t2k9,foople,2,Mon Mar 30 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"My win ratio is actually higher this install on pixel dungeon than shattered, but degradation is such negative fun I won't be playing vanilla pixel dungeon again while it exists.   I last played a wizard. Upgrade the initial wand, knowing you can reforge it later? Bad idea, now your initial wand is nearly broken and you can't use it at all.   Find +2 mail just before Goo?  Too bad it's +0 before the end of floor 6.   I've never skipped floors 22-24 before. Faced with needing 2+ upgrade scrolls per level just to stay even, I skipped it all, killed Yog and called it a day - permanently.   Incidentally, I had more healing pots at every stage of the game than any of my shattered wins. Degradation doesn't make the game harder, just more painful."
PixelDungeon,30t2k9,foople,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. Extremely painful. I still lost 6 upgrades getting to level 19 on the way by planning to weight stone / upgrade / enchant, then seeing a monster and immediately forgetting - losing the upgrade over and over. But situations like the double dwarf did it for me. Degradation means the weapon and armour can become too heavy for the player mid battle, resulting in 1-2 health now being 15 health and useless items. A good old monster bashing turning into an unwinnable game for no actual purpose."
PixelDungeon,30t2k9,stormoftara,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:58:31 2015 UTC,"I went battlemage and learned quickly that wand recharge melee hits cause degradation, despite what the wiki said, making the only class feature too expensive to use. I can't imagine how painful a sniper or old school gladiator would be."
PixelDungeon,30u8ia,Robin1997,3,Mon Mar 30 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"You throw it like a pokeball to release beedrill. I've never shattered it, but that should either release the bee right there or make the pot delicate enough to break from a distance or maybe even when a monster steps on it."
PixelDungeon,30u8ia,6Risk6,3,Mon Mar 30 20:19:54 2015 UTC,"What he said. While it's a situational item, it can actually save your bacon to toss a pot at someone, release a bee to fight for you, and use that time to get away, swap gear, pick at baddies with ranged weapons, or just use the bee to eat some damage you would have.  I believe shattering the pot, as opposed to tossing it toward monsters, causes the bee to stick to a single location, defending his pot area from anything close enough.  Once the pot's shattered, if you pick it back up,  I don't think it's useful for anything, except as a junk item to prop open doors or toss on traps. You can't even sell it."
PixelDungeon,30u8ia,NCOSRane,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:03:01 2015 UTC,"Actually shattering it is dangerous. The bee will defend the shattered pot which is, well, in your backpack while the bee is outside. In other words, it will attack you until you throw the pot somewhere.  No idea why is that possible, but, whatever. As for picking the pot up, it is useful if the bee is still alive and you want to ""reposition"" it."
PixelDungeon,30u8ia,Scharnvirk,2,Tue Mar 31 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"The bee will always try to be near the pot, it will prioritize going toward the pot over anything else.  Shattering the pot in-hand or picking up a broken pot will let you bring the bee with you before throwing the pot toward an unfortunate enemy. Just be ready to endure a bit of stinging if the bee is too close to you.  It's not really often that you want to shatter the pot in hand instead of throwing it to start, but it's there incase you do."

PixelDungeon,30tav6,Gorbonzo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:16:03 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, and don't quote me on this, potions of might and magical infusion that you get for having a ring of wealth are randomly generated (small chance of one or the other) in each new level you descend to. They're not dropped by monsters. But the ring of wealth does significantly up the chance and quality of monster loot, so you can bulk up on healing potions from flies, scrolls from shaman, gold from selling skeleton weapons, etc.  Warlocks stop getting hunger/health from kills once you're a high enough level that you're not getting experience from something, so you can't grind indefinitely banking on that. But a +7 horn should feed you okay. Nothing in levels 6-9 drops food, though.  Might as well use a well on your upgrade scroll and get that axe upgraded once more, unless you'd rather just dump all of your upgrades into the disintegration wand."
PixelDungeon,30tav6,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:27:45 2015 UTC,The monk levels are the easiest to grind in if you have a horn of plenty and get high enough leveled because monks drop food occasionally and the shamans have nice potions

PixelDungeon,30r19u,beautifulPrisms,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"There's a more complex equation, but each upgrade generally gives a bonus equal to the tier of the item.  So upgrading cloth gives +1 damage resistance, while plate gives +5.  Upgrading a knuckleduster, +1. Upgrading a glavie, +5.  Though the formula may start to skew a bit at higher levels.  For what to upgrade, this depends on your class.  Rogues get a dodge bonus for having strength higher than what's needed for their armor, so definitely prioritize the armor.  Mages rely more on their wands, so all armor for a battle mage, maybe 50-50 split for a warlock.  All armor for a sniper, maybe 50-50 for a warden (or even a bit of a priority for the weapon for a warden.)  50-50 for a gladiator (or maybe a bit of a priority for the armor - gladiators can stand there and get multiple successive hits to up their damage, which should off-set spending upgrades on the armor.)  Maybe 50-50 or a slight priority for the weapon for a berzerker. I like of like it when my berzerkers get hit a lot. I try to stay constantly at about 40% health with them."
PixelDungeon,30r19u,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:50:54 2015 UTC,I don't know what the exact equations are off the top of my head but from my in game experience it's   (base damage or damage reduction)+(weapon or armor tier)*(level of item)  So a scale armor+2 would be (8 base reduction)+(tier 4)*(level 2)  Or 8+(4*2)=up to 16 points of damage reduction

Use all your upgrade scrolls etc. And try get yourself some good armour or a weapon. Once you get the skill books then you can then focus on the long game (you obviously may end up dying once you have the skill book but that is fine).

I've been playing this game for a while, I found that a good strategy is to play with all classes that way ""heroes remains"" will be a variety of stuff you can scrounge up when going to upper levels.

As far as things breaking, instead of upgrading stuff the second you find a scroll, wait until it's a few hits away from breaking and then upgrade once, wait until it's about to break again and upgrade again or apply an enchant scroll to reset durability + give it a bonus."

PixelDungeon,30hsoo,00-Evan,14,Fri Mar 27 14:26:29 2015 UTC,"Every single wand is useful un-upgraded, though that depends on how you define ""useful."" The battle wands all give you a rechargeable ranged attack. Even if the damage isn't that great when not upgraded. Plus firebolt can be used to burn down barriers if you don't have that level's liquid flame potion yet, cook your mystery meat, destroy doors, and set monsters and grass on fire. Disintegration can destroy doors. Avalanche has a chance of stun (tough to use since you need a wall, but it's a great anti-tengu weapon). The only battle wands that really suck non-upgraded are lightning (but even non-upgraded, the extra damage in water isn't bad) and poison (which also sucks upgraded, btw.)  The non-battle wands are all pretty great, even not upgraded. Regrowth is just about the best one of them, for obvious reasons. Amok is seriously underrated but keeps you from eating a lot of damage in some spots (and kills piranhas awesomely!). Slow is obviously useful, though much less so non-upgraded due to the very short duration. Blink is amazing if you're a huntress of mage, just kind of useful otherwise. Telekinesis and teleportation are both kind of situational, so eh. I never use flock. It's annoying.  If I'm a mage, the only wand worth upgrading is magic missile once, and either firebolt or disintegration. Whichever I find first. If I don't find either, maybe lightning. But without one of those, I'll probably die before I get past the DM anyway.  If I'm not a mage, I never upgrade any wand, period. I'm too busy upgrading a good weapon, armor, or ring. If I have a really crappy run and the only thing worthwhile I've found by the time I hit the DM is a wand of firebolt +2, I guess I'd upgrade that and pretend I'm a mage for the rest of the run."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,NCOSRane,3,Fri Mar 27 15:56:17 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are pretty much the same as this. The only wands I ever bother upgrading as a mage are disintegration or firebolt, maaaybe lightning if I'm stuck. As a non-mage, firebolt is still great because it's so OP, but otherwise no upgrades.  From the vote I am surprised by how many people like the wand of teleport over other utility wands, and how many see some none-firebolt upgrades as worthwhile on none-mage classes."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,NCOSRane,4,Fri Mar 27 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"Some people see teleport as a one-shot kill. It gets rid of a baddie right away. For piranhas, it actually does kill them most of the time. I actually haven't tried this -- can you shoot a wall right next to you and make the teleport wand hit yourself like you can with other wands? That might actually be pretty useful.  Regrowth is pretty darn powerful. But not powerful enough to waste an upgrade scroll on it, IMO.  Blink is pretty killer if you're good at using it. For both mages and huntresses. A sniper might actually want to upgrade a blink wand to avoid running out of charges in a bad situation.  Telekinesis needs some love. It has its moments, but if it pushed enemies all the way down the hallway instead of one step away, that would be pretty potent. I'd use that as a sniper. I might even pair it with a wand of poison for other classes. Poison needs some love.  Flock is dumb, except for pairing with disintegration. If we want to pin, freeze, or block enemies, make a wand that mimics the frost potion, or a wand that shoots webs, or something like that. Maybe even a wand that locks a door and makes it inoperable for a short time.  Amok is awesomely underrated. My only beef with that is that some of the more annoying monsters out there are immune to it."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,SoylentGreenMuffins,3,Fri Mar 27 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I've used the wand of teleport on myself a few times. I don't really get it too often, but it totally works."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,NCOSRane,4,Fri Mar 27 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"That's unlimited teleport scrolls right there. That's pretty cool. Teleporting doesn't just get you out of (or into) a bind. You can find hidden rooms that way, or even cover ground quickly if you're lucky. And unlike scrolls, the wand has the dual use of sending enemies away. That's a pretty potent wand there, without going the OP route of the firebolt wand."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,DogOfSevenless,2,Fri Mar 27 20:11:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, my only issue is that isn't really an item worth upgrading. Not everything needs scrolls of upgrade, but I don't like the idea of gear the player can't invest in, which is why we have artifacts."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,NCOSRane,3,Sat Mar 28 08:06:03 2015 UTC,Telekinesis is only useful on levels with those bridges. You can push potentially powerful enemies into the pit and kill them instantly. Nothing more satisfying than one-shotting dwarf monks and golems.
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,EstherDarkish,2,Fri Mar 27 20:22:23 2015 UTC,"It's okay for trap-disarming, too. Or fetching an item across one of those levitation rooms.

PixelDungeon,30hsoo,EstherDarkish,4,Fri Mar 27 20:44:22 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm looking to keep the general utility of telekinesis and add a bit more power.  You're gonna send enemies flying

PixelDungeon,30hsoo,noobtablet9,6,Fri Mar 27 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"Seeing as wands types can be identified immediately with 0 risk I just don't think it makes sense for them to be discoverable in the first place.   As part of the wand rework I'm killing that and they'll identify like weapons and armor: you'll immediately know the type of the wand, but specifics like levels and curses will need to be found over time or with a scroll.  One of the big benefits of this is that each wand can have a unique sprite with its own tailored look."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,khondrych,3,Fri Mar 27 14:44:07 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that wands can be identified immediately and without any risk, (speculation: cursed wand that explode on the next patch?), I was thinking about having 2 initial letters on each wand's icon to save people like myself for some seconds of tapping and reading different red wands descriptions (eg: wait, this red one is blink, or that red one is sheep?)."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,biggreencat,3,Fri Mar 27 15:23:03 2015 UTC,"Right, but with unique sprites you won't need those initials, all the wands will look quite unique."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,RSquared,3,Fri Mar 27 15:25:41 2015 UTC,Please don't do this. Wands really shouldn't need a scroll. The identification system on wands works great as it is. Plus I don't really have the extra id scrolls to waste on a wand
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,RSquared,2,Fri Mar 27 21:56:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I'm not communicating this clearly, I'm not adding any complexity to identifying wands, I'm only reducing. The type of wand that you have will automatically be known, but, like with a weapon, you'll still need to use a scroll or spend time with the wand to fully identify it."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,Gorbonzo,2,Fri Mar 27 22:12:11 2015 UTC,Two questions.   If it is +1 will the wand still have 3 charges even if not identified?  If I have 14 strength and an unidentified +4 glaive will i be using the glaive as if I don't have enough strength to use it or will the upgrades still apply? Same question also applies to plate armor
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,biggreencat,2,Fri Mar 27 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"All identification affects is what you know about an item, otherwise the item functions exactly as if it were identified."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,khondrych,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:08:36 2015 UTC,"I think the point he's trying to make is, I can immediately tell a wand's level by shooting it until it runs out of charges. If you make me wait longer until the game displays its level, the only thing you're making me do is have to remember what level that wand is. I don't really see a good way around this myself. Unlike the current mechanic of keeping number of charges remaining unknown for a while, which adds a fun level of me having to mentally keep track, having me keep track of total charges per wand until it identifies is boring. I could write that down on a piece of paper if I wanted to.  What I would do, which I think you've already touched on, is add a degree of risk to shooting a totally unidentified wand with some sort of curse mechanic."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,Dreteus,2,Tue Apr 14 00:12:33 2015 UTC,"There are calculable risks. Firebolt will annihilate grass, doors, dewdrops, seeds. Avalanche next to a wall hurts. Lightning standing in water's no good. What about appending identifiers to the wands' tiles after they're identified? Like you did for potions. It's make selling them easier"
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,noobtablet9,3,Fri Mar 27 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"All of those risks can be mitigated extremely easily, just shoot at a wall at least a couple of tiles away from you.  I would normally have included identifiers, yes, but as I've stated there will be no point to it as with 0.3.0 wands are going to have unique sprites, and identify like weapons/armor. If you find a wand on the ground you'll already know the type, but not its specific properties."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,noobtablet9,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"The only thing that this affects is the two-choice treasure box.  Currently, it says the wood of wand in the box like rings show the gem, which will mean you know exactly what kind of wand is there - so you can make a more-informed decision than previously (unless you had already encountered that wand/ring in that game).  You may want to make it like the artifact one (""an artifact"" rather than ""horn of plenty"") or the other way around - I'm always annoyed when I get a duplicate artifact from that box...seems to happen weirdly often.    Could I suggest that poison wand leveling do more damage like dungeon tiers do? Since poison is currently 1 dmg in sewers, 2 in caves, 3 in prison...etc.  So level 2-3 increases poison duration, then duration resets (or drops one of the two duration bonuses) and poison strength goes up one tier at 4, 5-6 increases duration again, 7 increases tier by 2...etc.  Might give it enough damage to be useful in prison/hell."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"Chests will be changed to simply say 'A wand' instead of the exact type. I'll also change rings to 'A ring' for the sake of consistency.  Since 0.2.2 it should no longer be possible to get duplicate artifacts, from crystal chests or otherwise.  The wand of poison is basically getting scrapped, there will be a DOT wand to replace it, but it's going to require more strategy in exchange for significantly more damage."

Especially as the rogue and huntress where you already have one quick slot occupied, it can get sort of tedious having to open up the menu every time you want to use that other wand."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,NCOSRane,3,Fri Mar 27 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"when I remade the quickslot system in 0.2.3e I specifically designed it to support infinite slots, I agree that 2 is still too few often-times.  The UI still needs to fit those slots though. For desktop/landscape that's super easy as there's just space to put more slots in, but for portrait I'll likely do some form of pop-up menu, which could have as many slots as people want."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,NCOSRane,2,Fri Mar 27 15:43:17 2015 UTC,"What about having the quickslot area, or even the whole bottom of the screen, scrollable by swiping?"

PixelDungeon,30hsoo,MoronLessOff,2,Fri Mar 27 15:37:38 2015 UTC,Doesn't lightning do more damage? I'd take lightning over firebolt anyway. Especially in the early levels
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,Dmn98,2,Fri Mar 27 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Currently, lightning has a LOT of base damage, but it's out-scaled by both disintegration and firebolt."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,xhoi,2,Sat Mar 28 08:09:33 2015 UTC,This means that a +5 disintegration wand>+5 lightning wand right? I've never actually upgraded a wand if disintegration because their +0 damage sucks
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,Scharnvirk,3,Sat Mar 28 13:55:42 2015 UTC,"Lemme share some of the numbers I've lookd into, I'm calculating all of this stuff for balance:  lightning does 5+(lvl/2) to 10+lvl damage, but that is DOUBLED in water, so assuming water the wand deals a ridiculous 10+lvl to 20+lvl*2 damage, that's better than a tier 5 weapon at level 0!  Disintegration, on the other hand, deals lvl to 8+lvl*(lvl/3) damage. It also gains a bonus level for each enemy hit, lets assume one enemy hit, so it always deals damage as it it were 1 level higher.  We'll also include the OP standard, firebolt, which deals 1 to 8+(lvl*lvl) damage, plus fire.  so average damage each level is:    Level Lightning Disint. Firebolt    0 7.5/15 4.67 4.5+fire   1 8.25/16.5 5.67 5+fire   2 9/18 7 6.5+fire   3 9.75/19.5 8.67 9+fire   4 10.5/21 10.67 12.5+fire   5 11.25/22.5 13 17+fire   6 12/24 15.67 22.5+fire   7 12.75/25.5 18.67 29+fire   8 13.5/27 22 36.6+fire   9 14.25/28.5 25.67 45+fire   10 15/30 29.67 54.5+fire   11 15.75/31.5 34 65+fire   12 16.5/33 38.67 76.5+fire    So it does take a while, but disintegration beats lightning out of water at +4, and in any situation at +11, it becomes fairly comparable before then, especially without a risk of self-damage and the ability to pierce.  I do think that lightning's base damage is too high, I am going to be re-balancing it, but I haven't decided on specifics.  Firebolt, as ever, is stupidly OP."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,xhoi,2,Sat Mar 28 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"I think lightning is balanced by the fact that you can't use it against a guy right in front of you. Especially if you're standing in water. That's a pretty big drawback. In a pinch, you can blast both you and the baddie, but there's an unlimited number of baddies, and a limited amount of resources, so it's not a good practice to sacrifice a huge chunk of your health to kill one thing. Unlike the other two examples, it also has no special uses besides doing damage, though it does that neat thing where it hits adjacent enemies, which is pretty awesome.  But even a non-upgraded lightning wand will get its own quickslot for me, regardless of class, just to use as a ranged weapon against bad guys crossing some water to get to me. Instead of leaping to hit adjacent enemies, what if lightning zapped everything standing in the same body of water, but just a single target on land? That might be pretty fun/strategic. Then again, water's pretty random.  Firebolt's OP not just for the high damage, but all the other special crap. Burning bad guys, burning doors and terrain, cooking meat. It's darn useful as a non-battle wand in addition to killing stuff. Maybe tweak firebolt so the burning damage, rather than the initial damage, gets pretty potent with upgrades. But the initial hit is pretty weak. Still okay, but not a one-shot for 99% of the enemies. I think having to be careful that you're not standing in grass or a doorway is supposed to be a drawback, but the damage is so high that it's not much of a drawback. If the burning damage were more significant, maybe it would be a bigger consideration, but it's just not that hard to not light yourself on fire most of the time.  Disintegration's actually pretty balanced. It destroys doors, gets a conditional bonus if you get the enemies lined up right, does decent but not OP damage, and those butt-kicking evil eyes are resistant to it."
PixelDungeon,30hsoo,jbstjohn,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:31:55 2015 UTC,"Lightning isn't as stupidly OP as firebolt. To be clear I don't intend to really nerf it, but more refocus its power somewhat so its base stats aren't quite as ridiculous.  Disintegration is currently planned to get a fairly light buff, but it is largely in a good place at the moment."

PixelDungeon,30f801,NCOSRane,4,Fri Mar 27 00:51:30 2015 UTC,"I'll sell the stockpile of liquid flame potions you can get from elementals and warlocks if I happened to find a wand of firebolt. Makes them redundant. I'll also sell off one of the less useful types if I'm in a bind for inventory space (though the merchant's beacon has helped a lot with that). For example, purification is of limited use after the DM. I hardly ever use mind vision, except for maybe one on Yog if it's not evident where his fists are. Scrolls of rage are of limited use.  Anyway, there are definitely lesser scrolls/potions that don't see as much utility or that don't fit some playstyles, and if selling that gets you that one more healing potion, container, or something you actually need, it can be a convenience. Especially earlier in the game before you have the right container type for all of those scrolls or potions.  Some people say to sell strength potions beyond what you need for armor as a battlemage, since strength doesn't affect wand melee damage."
PixelDungeon,30f801,noobtablet9,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:07:42 2015 UTC,"Liquid flames- While I agree they become super abundant, I just use them every time I see an enemy  Purification is a never sell item. Purification+toxic gas+paralysis gas is the best way to fight yog and his fist  Mind vision is super helpful during the demon halls or when doing a quest for the imp  Strength- I don't even know why anyone would think of that, it literally takes 5 seconds (if that) to drink. I'm pretty sure you get a bonus for having more strength than the armor requires, but I could be wrong. You could also throw it into a well of transfusion and get a potion of might"
PixelDungeon,30f801,OrbisTerre,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:12:41 2015 UTC,Also it really sucks when you are JUST strong enough for some armor and then a warlock weakens you below that point.
PixelDungeon,30f801,noobtablet9,0,Fri Mar 27 18:09:06 2015 UTC,And why?
PixelDungeon,309lr3,PenguinSnuSnu,9,Wed Mar 25 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"You're invisible, just move to the wall and hope the fish move before your buff ends Start reading random scrolls, hope for teleport/terror (and not challenge :) )   But yeah, lol, you done got yourself in a pickle"
PixelDungeon,309lr3,BobbleBobble,5,Wed Mar 25 16:33:11 2015 UTC,I had no scrolls at the time... i waited hoping they would leave but they didnt.  Then i decided grim battleaxe may save my life and 10 healing pots would help... i got 2 hits and 2 pots off before i died. Luckily i had an ankh.
PixelDungeon,309lr3,b_fnk,13,Wed Mar 25 16:47:34 2015 UTC,Next time if death's imminent you can start throwing items so you don't lose them when the ankh revives you

PixelDungeon,309uzg,RC__throwaway__,6,Wed Mar 25 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Check in the source code here: https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/blob/master/src/com/shatteredpixel/shatteredpixeldungeon/items/artifacts/ChaliceOfBlood.java  From lines 77-78, the formula is: 3*(level of chalice2) So, first time is 3, then 12, 27, 48, 75, etc.  It's worth noting that Earthroot armor DOES absorb some of the damage from the Chalice. Here's the source code for Earthroot: https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/blob/master/src/com/shatteredpixel/shatteredpixeldungeon/plants/Earthroot.java  Lines 103-110 calculate the damage absorption with the Herbal Armor buff. It looks like it makes the damage taken = (damage - damage/2). So 50% of the damage is absorbed.   Nevertheless, it's a good idea to always have a blessed ankh if you plan on upgrading the chalice to high levels.  I should make it clear that I'm not an expert on Java, and my reading of the code may be wrong. Maybe the Almighty Evan can clear up my math."
PixelDungeon,309uzg,THEMBISCUIT,5,Wed Mar 25 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"I generally don't like giving specific code-related info on things, preferring for players to figure out the exacts through play.  I can make an exception in this case though, you are correct. The chalice starts by dealing 3*curLvl2 damage, and it is reduced by armour and earthroot like any other attack would be.  so the max damage at each prick is:    0 3 12 27 48 75 108 147 192 243     players regenerate 1 hp every 10 turns, each level on the chalice reduces the number of turns by one, except the final level (1 hp every 0 turns wouldn't quite work), which changes it to 2 hp every turn instead."
PixelDungeon,309uzg,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:25:15 2015 UTC,a blessed ankh if you plan on upgrading the chalice to high levels   Or a regular ankh if you just remember to drop all your gear before pricking yourself.

PixelDungeon,30bb23,dundun3425,3,Wed Mar 25 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"Using the weight stones to make heavier will increase total damage but decrease speed. Therefore you may hit harder but you will hit less often a round. Making an item lighter decreases total damage but it increases speed and sometimes adds an extra hit. I typically make my items lighter. For example a knuckle duster that has been balanced out to be lighter will sometimes hit 4 times in a row before the opponent gets one hit in (sometimes more). I would not advise using two weight stones on the same item (first heavier, then lighter) as I think this may actually bring it back to its original state."

Current priorities include better scaling (more options instead of off or on), better handling of desktop specific errors (like file permissions), in-place updating (i.e. it downloads and patches for you) and a proper desktop installer package.

PixelDungeon,305dld,Atomicpsycho,2,Tue Mar 24 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"I died recently with just about that same gear. Didn't quite have everything leveled up to that level, but close to it.  Had to chug two or three health potions as soon as I stepped foot into the monk rooms. By the time I made it to the golems, I was down to 3 health potions. Even with +3 War Hammer and +6 Plate armor and multiple useful and upgraded wands, I still died. Seemed like every other hit on me was a 25.  I realize this is all a game of luck with a little strategy on the side - I've learned this game well enough to make use of everything at my disposal, and I lucked out big time with the items I had found on that run.  Only way I can see how it's possible to get a win:   Reset 20 times for plate armor.  Reset 20 more times for plate armor+strength potion+upgrade scroll. Reset 20 more times for plate armor+strength potion+upgrade scrolls+crazy good artifact Reset 20 more times for plate armor+strength potion+upgrade scrolls+crazy good artifact+long sword   And that's just the first floor. Multiply all those resets by 2 for each level until you get all that and make it to Tengu. Multiply all that by 10 and then you have the probability that you will end up with all of the above, plus a self sustaining farming method. I don't see any other way anymore."
PixelDungeon,305dld,Booona,4,Wed Mar 25 05:03:47 2015 UTC,"You should really abuse the surprise door thing : if monks are hard (and they are), hit them once, lead them though another door, hit them again, do this until they are dead. If they disarm you on a doorstep, pick up the weapon, try to use something to slow them down (wand of slow / teleport / regrowth, a seed, a scroll) and after that equip the weapon again. If you have nothing to slow them, just equip the weapon, and if they immediately disarm it again, keep on equiping. Once the weapon is equiped again, run find another door."
PixelDungeon,305dld,EstherDarkish,2,Wed Mar 25 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"If I have nothing modifying my run speed, a monk will catch up and hit once for every step, right?"
PixelDungeon,305dld,Booona,3,Wed Mar 25 16:19:28 2015 UTC,"No. A monk will hit you multiple times when you're both trading hits, but a monk moves at the same speed that you do. So if you stand still and attack the monk, it will hit you multiple times for each time you hit it. However if you move one square away, the monk will follow by one square and not attack you.  The caveat to this is if you're wearing armor that is too heavy for you, because then you get a movement penalty based on how much more strength you need to wear said armor. You also have a movement penalty if you are crippled. Also, if you are ""weakened"" by a Warlock's magic attack it removes two strength from you while you are weakened, which can affect whether or not a weapon/armor is wearable."

PixelDungeon,300ec5,B_Boll,8,Mon Mar 23 13:46:34 2015 UTC,"Monk   Just a note that the ring of force in Shattered PD may well render a class based on unarmed combat obsolete (or overpowered if it finds one).  With a normal class packing a ring of force and a ring of might, I’m doing 40-ish damage per hit. Just saying.   Monks Start with 15 points of health   That seems like a bigger disadvantage than it is. In a few levels, a huntress does just fine. With that said, a health disadvantage makes sense for a range class. Not so much for a class that’s intended to get in an enemy’s face and punch it. It doesn’t fit the theme of the class.   Monks Start With a unique Meditation rug   This is actually a pretty weak item compared to what other classes get. Warriors get a sword they can later turn into a weapon upgrade that doesn’t destroy enchants. Mages get a wand that does the same thing for wands. Huntresses get a boomerang. Rogues get, essentially, a rechargeable invisibility potion (and both subclasses seriously benefit from that item). You want to give monks an extra potion of healing that recharges?   Monks are specialists with light armor, attacking faster when wearing one   You toss this bonus in near the top but never elaborate on it. What’s this mean? Do monks treat every point of strength they have over their armor as a +1 ring of furor? That might be the saving grace of the class.   Monks deals bonus damage when attacking a paralized enemy (x1.1)   So do assassins. And more than 1.1x. And nobody misses a paralyzed target, so paralysis is good for everyone. But rare. It’s not really something to base a class around.   Potins of paralitic gas are identified form the beginning   Good. I hate drinking those. If you’re a class that’s supposed to use paralysis to help you kill things, I guess that saves you from wasting your first one. Though you’ll need a purification potion to not freeze yourself, too. And paralysis doesn’t always last all that long on the bad guys.   Backpack   Other than starting the game with a knuckleduster, there’s really nothing that ties a monk to unarmed fighting.  In fact, there’s no point to a monk, other than the bruiser subclass below, from actually fighting unarmed. I’d rather attack faster in light armor and do extra damage to paralyzed opponents with an upgraded glaive. Also, unless monks are going to start the game with 14 strength, those 3x curare darts aren’t going to do them much good early on.   Bruiser   See my note above. A ring of force makes your unarmed attacks super-charged, regardless of class. Would that stack with the bruiser’s bonus damage? Anyway, all knuckledusters are 2 attacks per round, regardless of level of upgrade. Their average damage is 3+level.  So a level 26 bruiser about to take on Yog is going to be punching twice per round, for an average damage of 16? If I’ve dumped a bunch of upgrade scrolls into a real weapon, I’ll do way more damage than that. This guy’s going to have a hard time getting past the dwarf city, barely nicking his way through those golems and warlocks. Plus, you can’t enchant your fists. My +9 glaive can be vampiric or stunning or eldritch, and so on. Battlemages sacrifice having a good weapon, too, but at least their weapon of choice shoots firebolts for 100+ damage when you upgrade it sufficiently and recharges when you hit something with it.  The paralysis chance is at least a nice bonus, since stunning is a pretty rare enchantment.   Spiritualist   This guy is about as painful as the warden. Maybe moreso. His only special ability can only be used once every 250 steps, and it heals him, but only partially, slightly reduces hunger, and gives him a brief damage buff. And he’s sacrificing an artifact slot to equip that crappy meditation rug to do it.   Unique Armor   Reminds me of a succubus. But honestly, none of the unique armors are that great, so this one’s as good as any of the others. Maybe you’d want the armor ability to be tied to paralysis or healing (or both) since those are the monk’s things."
PixelDungeon,300ec5,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:39:34 2015 UTC,"""You toss this bonus in near the top but never elaborate on it. What’s this mean? Do monks treat every point of strength they have over their armor as a +1 ring of furor? That might be the saving grace of the class.""  Like the Rogues do with evasion, the same for this class. My bad not elaborate.  Other think you pointed is how weak the Rug is. I Think with a slow  recharge and bigger heal on early on it will become equal to the others and work as intented to balance the 15HP think. Also this will buff spiritualist.  Another think to turn spiritualist stronger is to make the Buff to only start to fade when enter on combat and reduce duration (10 turns maybe?). I Think on it always intablink after meditate.  About the bruiser, I used the knuckleduster as base becouse I have no other example.   A complexer formula for damage may be [lvl +3] on avarage damage and attack [1 + lvl/10] (with minimum 2) per round, rounded Down with [Fractionpart_of(lvl/10)*100]% chance of an extra attack on the turn. That means, a lvl 25 Bruiser will deal an avarage 28 per hit, hiting 3 times per round (total 84 damage) and have 50% chance of an extra attack.  That way I think the Spiritualist way have no relation to the unarmed-paralize way of play, While Bruiser have nothink with Rug. Same class, but to totally distinct ways of be played, one will go by resilience and can use a big glaive, the othe can use their Up-scrolls on other think than Weapon and go late game with a big damage and a great upgraded armor.  What do you think?"
PixelDungeon,300ec5,NCOSRane,2,Mon Mar 23 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"Like the Rogues do with evasion, the same for this class. My bad not elaborate.   I think rogues get the equivalent of a +1 ring of evasion for each point of strength over their armor. Whatever the math, they get a dodge bonus, anyway. The actual numbers don't matter. That's for coders to figure out. But giving monks an attack speed bonus is great. Probably the saving grace of the class. That, alone, is a butt-kicking ability that sets them apart. Might be too good, actually. But that would be an issue for someone who designs stuff to tweak numbers and balance things.   Other think you pointed is how weak the Rug is. I Think with a slow recharge and bigger heal on early on it will become equal to the others and work as intented to balance the 15HP think. Also this will buff spiritualist.   Healing 95% of my hp every 500 steps (250 if the second subclass) is a pretty weak ability. The game already has a dew vial and healing potions that heal you better, and whenever you want. Plus sungrass seeds, dewdrops, an occasional health well. And there's already a healing artifact: the chalice of blood. That thing heals 2hp a step when fully upgraded (good luck getting there), but isn't that bad before that.  I'd go a different route with a unique monk artifact. Same line of thinking, but not a conventional healing item. Turn that rug into some prayer beads or something, and when a monk uses them, for a short duration he doesn't need to breathe (affected by the purification buff - that goes great with his tossing paralysis potions around), eat (for the duration, hunger doesn't increase and he takes no starvation damage if he's already starving), or feel pain (all damage he takes is treated as through he's wearing viscosity armor. He'll take it one point at a time later.)  That's kind of like healing and hunger reduction, but more in line with a fighting class.   About the bruiser, I used the knuckleduster as base becouse I have no other example.    I think if the monk is already getting an attack speed bonus for wearing armor less than his strength, giving the bruiser a speed bonus on top of that might be redundant, and possibly overpowered. I'd actually simplify that whole set of equations. Just let a bruiser attack twice while barehanded (as though he's using a knuckleduster). And treat him as through he's wearing a ring of force with an upgrade based on his level (let the designers figure out whether +level, +level/2, or some other number would work best). That will up his unarmed damage significantly and make up for the artifact slot he's sacrificing to use his monk item.   That way I think the Spiritualist way have no relation to the unarmed-paralize way of play,   The spiritualist being tied to one single item and having no other special ability is a little silly. Since this guy is somehow attuned to spiritual energy and recharging artifacts, I'd have all of his equipped artifacts recharge faster, whatever artifact he happens to have equipped. Tying in with his purification buff from the monk artifact, I'd also give him a resistance bonus - treat him like he's wearing a ring of elements with an upgrade level based on his level. So paralysis won't affect him for as long, he's more resistant to poison gas, poison, magic attacks, affection, etc. That's kind of spirit-ish."

You burn through countless potions and countless seeds brewing potions trying to guess the right three potions and the right order to upgrade it. When you finally have the thing upgraded, it lets you brew potions for fewer seeds. Of course, you already went through 99% of the seeds in the game just to get the thing upgraded.  It's probably the worst special ability of all of the artifacts, but the hardest to upgrade. With the talisman, you just walk around. With the spellbook, you just add the scroll you're told. With the sandals, you just feed it seeds you haven't before. With the chalice, you drain your health. With the horn, you feed it food.  But with this thing, you guess over and over again and lose valuable potions for nothing (and you might not even have the potions you need to get it upgraded).  And its special ability sucks.  Most people prefer seeds as items over potions anyway."

It should be reworked or scrapped.  A better artifact that interacts with potions and consumes them (just like how the other artifacts consume seeds food scrolls life etc) would be one that lets you enchant a weapon with a potion type.  You can sacrfice a set of two or three potions to level it up and grant an attack buff based on the potion type for a temporary number of rounds.  I just thought of this but its a really good idea thematically and mechanically.  Consuming a heath pot into this artifact grants the ever powerful vampiric buff for a certain, scalable # rounds. Frost is chilling, flame is fire, poison is poison, etc. Levitation could shock or bounce or increase speed? Purification ia a tough one, but maybe lucky? Experience could just add a few levels to your weapon, temporarily. Might.could do a flat damage boost.  Man there are a ton of ways you could make an alternative way to consume potions more fun than the Alchemist kit."

PixelDungeon,2zmyk7,AsheIsFine,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"In the case of warrior or mage, I always spend the first scroll on the short sword or wand of magic missile, as these can be transferred to any other weapon or wand (only 1 upgrade though!). In the case of rogue, their special dodge bonus is buffed as the difference between your strength and the required strength of your armor increases, so I rtend to place all of my early upgrades into my cloth armor so that hopefully I have a ludicrous dodge when my strength is high and my armor is upgraded (five strength pots and 4 upgrade scrolls give a +10 difference, which makes for a LOT of dodging).   Otherwise, I tend to shoot for the moon and use them on the best items I find, even though this often backfires when I have a +3 glaive I still can't use and then I die. But when it works, it's sweet."
PixelDungeon,2zmyk7,THEMBISCUIT,2,Tue Mar 24 06:04:13 2015 UTC,"Two questions I've been wondering about and this is probably the perfect time to ask:  For the rogue, they receive a dodge bonus if they are wearing ""light"" armor. Does that include only cloth and leather armor, or mail armor as well?  Also for rogue, does the dodge buff increase depending on how low a tier armor you are wearing? For example, do you receive a higher dodge bonus if you are wearing cloth armor as opposed to leather armor? I feel like that's sort of what you were getting at."
PixelDungeon,2zmyk7,THEMBISCUIT,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:52:57 2015 UTC,"They get a dodge bonus for all armors. You don't have to be wearing a specific one. Also the tier of armor doesn't matter. The dodge bonus is dependent solely on the difference between the hero's strength and the required strength of the armor.  So, Rogues start with cloth armor (9) and a strength of (10), so a ""dodge bonus"" of (1). If you upgrade the cloth armor and then drink a strength potion, you now have armor (8) and strength (11), so the ""dodge bonus"" is (3). Or if instead you find some normal leather armor and a strength vial, you can wear the armor and get a bit more damage reduction, but at the expense of getting hit more often, with a ""dodge bonus"" of 0.  Now how do these numbers actually work? Time for math, yay!   All heroes have a base defense skill score. It starts at (5) and increases every time you level up. Each hero also has an evasion score which starts at 1.15, and can be increased with a ring of evasion +x, to 1.15x. And of course, we'll recall our Dodge Bonus from above (Strength - Str. Requirement of Armor)  Other heroes have a modified defense score of: (Base Defense Skill) * (Evasion)  However, Rogues have a modified defense score of: (Base Defense Skill + Dodge Bonus) * (Evasion)   A higher defense score means you will get hit less often.  Hope that helps!"
PixelDungeon,2zn3iq,lookslikeyoureSOL,12,Thu Mar 19 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is one of the biggest indicators of a player's skill.  Initially players will do what they can with what they get, more about building experience with the game here, and the sewers are rarely if ever beaten. Without much game knowledge, players don't really have a full feel for the game's variance yet, so purposefully killing a run to try again isn't thought of so much.  After a while the player gets a feeling for how well they play the game and what tools they need to do well, this is where restarting happens. Many runs are forfeited to save time, but those that aren't usually go at least decently. Players start winning the game towards the mid/end of this stage, depending on luck.  Slowly as the player's skill grows the runs they forfeit grow lesser and lesser, as they are able to do better with fewer tools. This is the stage most vets get to, where the sewers are beaten on at least half of the runs and some good fortune will usually turn into a won game."

I did not know that ring of might helps me with hitting my enemies,  I thought it would be redundant with my chalice of blood and just speed up my speed of health regain.   Does someone know if I can prick myself again on the chalice? I vaguely remember looking up the formula in the source code - something along the lines of 3 * level2. But I'm not sure if it's the level of the chalice or of my character."
PixelDungeon,2zm46m,TrillTrill,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:21:39 2015 UTC,"Reminder : the Ring of might brings you +1 Strength and +5 HP per level. More STR, more damage, more healing. But DO NOT remove the ring with you are low on HP : removing the rings removes the additional HPs, which may kill you.  I don't think it's a good idea to prick again... It's too dangerous. You need a good armor and Health Potions. After a certain level of HP the 'natural healing' process is really marginal, and all you need is Health Potions. Plus, you already gain HPs with the Vampiric sword. So I think it's all good. Put your upgrades on :   Ring (once) Armor (all the other upgrades) Weapon upgrade once more your Vampiric sword if you have the opportunity.   Depending on what you'll get from the Imp Quest, you will have to replace the Chalice by another Ring (the Imp will give you a +3 cursed ring). If it's Speed, Accuracy or Evasion, you'd better wear them and sell the Chalice. In the final levels, you don't have the time heal naturally, you only use potions."

Good thing I got those, because the best armor I managed to get was +2 scale of potential.  Alternated the rest of my upgrade scrolls on a ring of might and a ring of sharpshooting.    Had to dash through the demon hall levels with magic mapping scrolls instead of clearing them. Not enough potions left due to crappy armor."
PixelDungeon,2zh3ep,NCOSRane,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:43:06 2015 UTC,How does the wieghtstone affect the boomerang? Is it worth it?
PixelDungeon,2zh3ep,NCOSRane,3,Wed Mar 18 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on your other items and on what enchantment you get on it.  Making it heavy significantly ups its damage, which is great for snipers who ignore armor. But it's much slower, so enemies close range faster, which really sucks. But if you have wands of blink or slow, or a ring of haste, or something like that, you can compensate for the slower attack rate. Heavy also works off of a percentage of the normal damage, so you'd want to use heavy with a highly upgraded boomerang, not just some +3 that you stopped upgrading because you got it enchanted. You can also pair this with something like a stunning or eldritch melee weapon. The enemy gets close, but you smack them with something enchanted then make distance again.  Making it light significantly lowers its damage in exchange for speed. The boomerang is a pretty inaccurate weapon, so less damage for more attacks can be a bad deal if you don't have rings that improve accuracy. They're not essential, but they really make the decision easier. If you were relying on your boomerang to quickly dispatch enemies with high damage hits, you're in trouble now, too. But if you have a really good enchantment, like stun, vampiric, eldritch, or unstable, that you want to give as many chances as possible to fire off, then more attacks is a great idea."

If I remember correctly, the strength of their grass-trampling buff is based on their hp. And I had a hugely upgraded ring of might, so my grass buff was pretty good, not to mention the bonus hp from the ring. The first three upgrades didn't even do damage. The final upgrade did a little over 100, through an earthroot and the grass buff.  Healing 2 hp per step is nice, but you still spend the huge majority of the game starving, so it's of limited use."

I played vanilla for well over 100 games before switching, but all the cool new stuff in Shattered makes it a bit more interesting, especially after having dedicated some time to the original. There's just more stuff, cool new items and such. Plus, much as I hate to sound scrubby, not having to worry about your items constantly degrading is nice."
PixelDungeon,2zf6st,NCOSRane,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:24:39 2015 UTC,"I played the regular game quite a bit. I got every badge except the all rings/wands badges. I was actually just one or two more rings shy of the all rings badge, then the game implemented degradation. There's a lot wrong with the concept and the mechanics. It's been tweaked and balanced somewhat since then, but I think if the developer is really serious about that aspect of the game, there need to be some major overhauls in the way other things work to compensate.  I started Shattered solely expecting a version of the game that was pretty much the same, just minus degradation, and it delivered. But Shattered also has some extra content. It balanced a few items, added a few items, replaced a few items with more interesting or more logical or more balanced versions of those items.  Mechanics-wise, Shattered is pretty much identical, just without degradation. But content-wise, there's more stuff to try out. Degradation was the deal-breaker for a lot of players. Notice how three quarters of the posts in this sub are all Shattered posts? Though I'm told some tweaks have made degradation more playable in recent times."
PixelDungeon,2zf6st,McSchwartz,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Vanilla for a while, >100 games, and I've really been enjoying it. I was kinda shocked when I found out about the outrage regarding item degradation. I thought it was well done. I conserved upgrade scrolls to only use them when things were nearly fully degraded, and I had backup weapons and armor. I used enchant scrolls for their side effect of repairing armor. It was hard as balls, of course, but I got used to it.  I had to switch because a bug suddenly appeared after an android update, and I started losing a lot of game progress very frequently, if I didn't exit the game in a very specific way, and battery draining even when the game was in the background. I didn't mind degradation, but I don't mind not having it either :>"

I must have played a thousand games by now. The game, since the old days has become really easy for me to win. I never completely got bored with the mechanics, but time gets to you and the game started to feel repetitive. And with the introduction of degradation, the satisfaction the game provided slowly went away. Sure, it got more challenging, but for what price. I could simply not get that perfect run with a +10 vampiric halberd/longsword I always wanted. And even if I did, it would be so precious and ridiculously fragile, that after 1 goddamn floor it would be a +9, or not vampiric anymore.   So I decided to give shattered a try. And yeah, I must honestly say I am impressed. It's an amazing breeze of fresh air for me. It's got loads of shiny new items/artifacts with (for me) mysterious properties and after a couple dozens of runs there's always something new to find. And I've yet to win. It feels as if there were less healing potions and more ways to get yourself in trouble and die stupidly. I love it."

As a warrior, every 10 steps you have a 30% chance to take 1HP of damage. So if you get unlucky, you could walk 60 steps and be dead.  This damage also applies when dropping items. If starvation damage reduces you to 1HP, you will have enough time to drop 10 items before you have a 30% chance of dying. So since you have 18 items, it'd be best to start dropping items at 2/90HP to make sure you can drop everything.

PixelDungeon,2z4kxi,BaconOke,8,Sun Mar 15 14:56:02 2015 UTC,Why is your screen so orange?
PixelDungeon,2z4kxi,twilightassassin,9,Sun Mar 15 17:14:29 2015 UTC,I use an app called twilight which adjusts the colour of the screen at night. It's similar to f.lux on pc. Basically it makes your screen go red which is much kinder on your eyes at night. It also helps you sleep better and you don't wake up with blood shot eyes the next day.  Can't recommend it enough! You barely notice it while you are using it.
PixelDungeon,2z4kxi,duketrf,3,Sun Mar 15 17:29:32 2015 UTC,Does it work though?
PixelDungeon,2z4kxi,duketrf,4,Sun Mar 15 20:06:28 2015 UTC,I swear by it. I can't comment on whether it actually helps you sleep better but I certainly notice that my eyes get sore when reading from a screen at night which doesn't have f.lux or twilight. And on nights when I have inadvertently disabled the app my eyes are typically bloodshot the following morning.

You want to first use your invisible potions and mirror scrolls to scout out the 2 fists and Yog's position. You want to pull the fists significantly away from Yog. If your feeling  ballsy you can kill the fists but you should typically ignore them. When the fists are away use an invisible potion and position yourself beside a wall and Yog. If you can get on top of cool lava then better. Start slapping Yog and let the larva surround you. They protect you from the fists. When you get low just drink a pot. If you have decent items and levels it should take about 2-3 pots worth of slapping to kill Yog. When Yog dies the fists should die. Kill the larva and get on top of lava if you weren't before. The larva inflicts caustic ooze. Then you win. GG

PixelDungeon,2z3lht,jonsknownothing,1 point,Sun Mar 15 06:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is now a scroll of enchanting that replaces both the scroll of weapon upgrade and arcane stylus, it provides the enchantment only with no level upgrade, and there are a few of them so you can try for something specific or enchant multiple items. You should try the original if you haven't recently, item degradation is more manageable now with enchanting scrolls, upgrade scrolls, weight stones, and reforging/disenchanting of starting weapon. It really encourages you to change gear more often and to try to identify all your gear. Shattered is just a little too easy now I feel, still enjoy both though."

PixelDungeon,2z3lht,DragonDePlatino,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:21:26 2015 UTC,"I've had a thought about this, recently!   You know how that, even though the specific floor may change, you are guaranteed to acquire certain items in the beginning of the game?   Why not have a similar set up with a well of transformation (for example, some time after goo, and before Tengu) and have it ""reset"" every time that you come into the floor/upgrade itself with every upgrade scroll you throw in to be able to not run out of ""transformation charges"".   Mechanic wise it would make weapon enchantments a more common experience without sacrificing balance , and give a ""sub-quest"" aspect to the gameplay (""I'm at depth 15 with 4 scrolls of upgrade, I can go forward, or dip into my food reserves and trek to the well for a payoff"")!   With all the nifty loot that drops in those floors you'd have a grab bag of random stuff, too!"
PixelDungeon,2z3lht,NCOSRane,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:15:01 2015 UTC,For Shattered. I almost no opportunity to use it even if you get the enchanted weapon. I because there is a danger that enchanted disappears when you upgrade. I think that should not disappear enchanted Unlike glyph.
PixelDungeon,2z3lht,DragonDePlatino,0,Mon Mar 16 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"TL;DR  Here's a fix:  When enchanted, the knife will deal it's enchanted effect twice as often as other weapons. This'll make the knife a more viable endgame weapon like the knuckleduster, and will open up some interesting strategies if the knife is used as a sidearm."

PixelDungeon,2z1l5l,NCOSRane,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"Affection with a sniper or battlemage works really well.  Entanglement and metabolism are really good for just about any build that's not relying on kiting monsters.   Bounce and displacement are situationally good if you're a mage/huntress or another class that happens to have found a good wand or two. But they're a death sentence against dwarf warlocks. You'll pretty much need spare armor just for those guys.  The rest kind of suck. You'll take far more damage from any of the others than they'll dish out for you. Light me on fire, destroying all of my scrolls and damaging me each turn until I run to water, but freezing an enemy? What the heck kind of ""benefit"" is that? Making mirror images or shooting piddly little shocks, but damaging me more than the monsters get hurt to do so? Seriously? I wear armor to avoid damage.  Edit: Oh yeah. Viscosity is good for everybody. Your armor soaks that damage for you and makes you take it one point at a time until you've eaten it all. That's pretty awesome (when it works) against golems, enraged gnoll brutes, or anybody else for that matter."

If losing change doesn't remove armband points, you could do this until you could just steal the whole shop, amirite?"
PixelDungeon,2ywyrj,superbottles,2,Fri Mar 13 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"There  are a few very helpful posts on this if you know how to search(I don't) The best advice I can give is to save upgrade scrolls until you find an endgame weapon/wand/ring/armor( degradation makes this a little trickier) If you find the next floor early drop your scrolls off in a safe place to avoid losing them in fire. Use doors for surprise attacks. Be smart about enemies(fight fire elements in water, fight warlock guys in melee, fight monks near a door/stairs). Personally I prioritize damage until at least level 15 but much is dependent on what you end up finding. Also some seeds/potions are extremely useful in boss fights. IMO having 5-10 health potions by floor 11 is normally enough to win with deccent equipment so don't worry about not having 20+"
PixelDungeon,2ywyrj,Morleen,2,Fri Mar 13 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"Wait until the end of a level to drink potions. Always drink random potions in a puddle(stop fire), near a door(escape gasses). If the level has a piranha room you're probably going to have an invisibilty potion. If you have a large quantity of unidentified potions you can assume they are healing potions, don't identify them, if you can get to a store with them unidentified you can buy them unidentified for cheap.  Wands of Slow slow down monster attack speed.  Maybe I'll think of more."
PixelDungeon,2ywyrj,ZNasT,2,Fri Mar 13 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"To add on to the thing about the piranha/invisibility potion, this is usually the case for all floors with special rooms. If you find a bookcase there is a fire potion, if you find a poison gas room there will be a potion that blocks smells on that level."

PixelDungeon,2ywpew,Booona,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:05:03 2015 UTC,"I know you're not always going to get lucky, but -- is there a higher chance of that room having really good shit in it compared to other rooms that require just a key?"
PixelDungeon,2ywpew,PenguinSnuSnu,2,Sat Mar 14 03:41:24 2015 UTC,I've come across similar issues. One room left that is locked. No key. Its possible its underneath another item that you dropped/didnt pick up.
PixelDungeon,2ywpew,sfiodsh,4,Fri Mar 13 13:50:02 2015 UTC,Close. The problem is that the key is in the locked room. You need to go one floor up and fall down a chasm to reach it.

Seriously though, while I do have plans for Yog they aren't coming soon, and they don't involve just tacking some aggro on the eye. I'm pretty sure nothing I did last patch should affect the eye's behavior.  I've heard of this before, not sure if it's related to changes I've made or if it's a rare source issue.  Edit: were you by any chance a rogue who used his armor's power? Or did you use a wand of telekinesis to get him to move onto a blindweed? I've done some digging and can confirm both of these are source bugs which will make yog aggro you when he shouldn't."
PixelDungeon,2yvoe6,00-Evan,3,Fri Mar 13 05:08:46 2015 UTC,"I was in fact a rogue that used his armour ability! And now that I think about it, he didn't come after me before I'd used it. Is it a reliable bug? Cos I rather enjoyed having him come after me."
PixelDungeon,2yvoe6,00-Evan,5,Fri Mar 13 05:22:44 2015 UTC,"yup and i'll be patching it. Sorry to make you wait but a better yog boss fight shouldn't be the result of a bug, source or otherwise.  edit: though it's rare to do it, this is actually a pretty serious source issue, it causes all kinds of weirdness whenever it's used on anything that should be passive.  edit edit: when I say weirdness I mean it'll probably break your save, do not do."

PixelDungeon,2yq9yh,NCOSRane,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"I've never considered the huntress harder than the other classes. It's just a different set of abilities that you have to play differently. The same way you'd play a mage different from a warrior or rogue. The sniper is actually a pretty awesome subclass. The warden, not as much, but it fits the theme of each class having one useful subclass and one situational subclass.  Gladiator - always useful. Berzerker - special ability only happens at 40% health. Battlemage - always useful. Warlock - special ability only happens against enemies worth exp. Assassin - always useful if you know how to be sneaky and use doors. Freerunner - only happens when you're not starving which seems minor, but toward the last half of the game you're pretty much always starving. Sniper - always useful. Warden - both special things only happen when there's grass around."

Because!:  1- Berserker with a knuckleduster is great, like you said  2- Berserker is more effective when starving, which means you can save up lots of food early on  I'm convinced that Berserker always has the best chances of winning, out of all the sub-classes."

PixelDungeon,2yp0qe,ThunfischGott,3,Wed Mar 11 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"Heavy and light weapon damage is not reduced by a flat amount (like one scroll), but scales by a percentage, such that the overall DPS still equals out to about 100%. A significantly upgraded heavy weapon will deal MUCH more than one scrolls worth of extra damage."
PixelDungeon,2yp0qe,00-Evan,0,Wed Mar 11 17:10:22 2015 UTC,Ah good to know :) still heavy weapons feel a bit lack luster to me as those extra turns for your enemies (especially bosses) can be hella dangerous and the attack boost does not feel that big to make up for the risk btw awesome mod you made tgere beat it today for the first time ^/
PixelDungeon,2yp0qe,NCOSRane,2,Wed Mar 11 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"I do heavy weapons all the time. Light weapons actually annoy me against those pesky enemies that block 5 out of 6 attacks, then that one attack that hits them is a light hit.  Heavy weapons work well if you're armored to the gills (and/or a well-dodging rogue) and you take advantage of doors for surprise attacks (plus extra damage if you're an assassin, or if you're a low-health berzerker). If you know you're not going to miss, and you're armored or dodgy enough that if you need a second blow to kill something it's not the end of the world, heavy weapons are where it's at."
PixelDungeon,2yp0qe,causa-sui,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"For me, I go by the type of weapon and the enchantment I have on it. For example:  If it's an unstable weapon, light every time for the extra debuffs. If it's a venomous or lucky weapon, heavy because there's little to no benefit for landing extra debuffs and lucky benefits hugely from the extra maximum damage.  If you're an assassin then heavy is awesome for opposite reasons: if a very fast enemy like a vampire bat survives the first hit from a light weapon, it will squeeze an attack in. But since even very fast enemies can't survive the first hit from a surprise attack with a heavy weapon, you don't have this problem anymore. Also, if it's a slow and accurate weapon like a warhammer, you want heavy because it has a better chance of killing dangerous enemies like golems in 1, 2, or 3 hits."
PixelDungeon,2yp0qe,cranialAnalyst,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"Heavy for accurate weapons, sneak attacks, big damage buffs lucky, high upgrade weapon)  Light for additive debuffs or cc debuffs (burning chiling, vampiric) and on knuck or maybe eveb mace.   Most of the time hitting once with a good heavy weapon is better because they'll die and not attack again"
PixelDungeon,2ym730,duketrf,4,Tue Mar 10 23:15:59 2015 UTC,"So, this can be summed up as :  Requirements:   Armor and weapon strong enough to finish the game The best artifact you can get, +10 Beating Goo, Tengu and DM300 and beating everything in the dwarven city easily with your stuff"

PixelDungeon,2ym730,jyjjy,2,Wed Mar 11 03:33:39 2015 UTC,"I think this will just get you up to level 22 with a bunch of potions(though I guess some would be experience if you do it enough.) I believe that is the max level at which the monsters there give you experience. Should work fairly well on the other depths as well. Doing it in the caves would help max out the horn by collecting the mystery spider meat plus you would get money, scrolls and health potions from the other monsters."

PixelDungeon,2ymvfu,ItsSomethingLikeThat,2,Wed Mar 11 04:50:46 2015 UTC,It's actually quite fun in the demon halls as the evil eyes will shoot everyone up.

PixelDungeon,2yjtgd,00-Evan,6,Tue Mar 10 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"lol, that one's a source issue.  It seems like the game was never really built to handle the player losing large amounts of gold and being able to pick it back up. I'll probably either build in proper functionality for this, or just change mimics to make you drop a very small amount of gold.  Course there was once a time when gold was an item that you could drop and pick up, that was before badges though, makes sense that adding them necessitated changing how gold works."

PixelDungeon,2yhjnw,00-Evan,11,Mon Mar 9 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"The dew vial was nerfed in shattered, it does not auto revive. The game tells you this both in the item's description, and also in a message in the game log when you pick the vial up.  I made this change as the vial was not only a free safety net, but also made the ankh completely irrelevant. The vial can now instead be used to bless an ankh when full. A blessed ankh will auto-revive you just like the pre-nerf dew vial would, and will break in the process. This makes revives harder to get and makes ankhs relevant again."
PixelDungeon,2yhjnw,00-Evan,5,Mon Mar 9 21:43:11 2015 UTC,Whaaaaaat. That's actually pretty amazing and I'm surprised I missed that. If this wasn't challenging enough that's another aspect lol. Thanks alot though!

PixelDungeon,2yh1jf,00-Evan,5,Mon Mar 9 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"Like a scroll of weapon update works with weapons, it will give armor a random glyph it it doesn't have one already, or guarantee a glyph is retained through an upgrade if the armor already has one."
PixelDungeon,2yh1jf,omegajourney,5,Mon Mar 9 19:58:43 2015 UTC,Honestly it's a huge waste. I've only ever gotten one well per game and using it to do the same thing a stylus can do is a huge waste.
PixelDungeon,2yh1jf,jyjjy,2,Mon Mar 9 20:16:07 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking and since I never use the styluses I think I'll just save the well for something else later.

PixelDungeon,2yh1jf,jyjjy,2,Tue Mar 10 20:46:11 2015 UTC,It doesn't add a +1 or lower the strength requirement but it does add the damage reduction equivalent of upgrading. You can see it in the item description if you look before and after.

It can be used to summon the ghost to fight alongside the player, apparently.  Is this a new item or old news?  Item Text: ""Is this the rose that the ghost mentioned before disappearing?  It seems to hold some spiritual power, perhaps it can be used to channel the energy of that lost warrior.  The rose rests in your hand, it feels strangely warm.  The rose has lost most of its petals.  It feels extremely frail, like it could snap any moment.""  Edit: Now I'm finding rose petals throughout the dungeon."
PixelDungeon,2yhaow,00-Evan,8,Mon Mar 9 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"This was added in shattered v0.2.3  I removed the dried rose quest as it didn't really offer any interesting gameplay, but didn't want to drop the item entirely. My solution was to remake it into an artifact, which also had the added benefit of giving an ally npc and expanding on the ghost's character a bit."
PixelDungeon,2ydnc9,duketrf,4,Sun Mar 8 22:20:12 2015 UTC,"Blacksmith only gives +1 to first item you give him.  Had games where i found 3 sets of +3 scale, very frustrating."
PixelDungeon,2ydnc9,Monorail5,2,Sun Mar 8 23:50:19 2015 UTC,I wish it would add the modifiers together instead of a flat +1.
PixelDungeon,2ydnc9,THEMBISCUIT,2,Mon Mar 9 00:37:57 2015 UTC,Or at least a random chance to get a better armor. Maybe with the chance of not getting any upgrade at all.  /u/00-Evan pls.
PixelDungeon,2ydnc9,kisdee,2,Mon Mar 9 06:36:14 2015 UTC,Random from 1-however many the less upgraded one has? So two sets of +3 would be 3+(1-3)
PixelDungeon,2ydnc9,kisdee,2,Mon Mar 9 09:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with decreasing chance of getting a better item afterwards.  For example:   (+3)+(+3)->(+4): 60% chance (+3)+(+3)->(+5): 25% chance  (+3)+(+3)->(+6): 10% chance (+3)+(+3)->(+3): 5% chance"
PixelDungeon,2ydnc9,jyjjy,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:24:31 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter what order you give them to him. He always adds +1 to the one with the highest level.

PixelDungeon,2yg3re,Ginfandango,3,Mon Mar 9 15:04:02 2015 UTC,You can search for HP and STR and modify them too. And I don't recomand cheating...
PixelDungeon,2yg3re,Lucian41,3,Mon Mar 9 15:47:01 2015 UTC,Whats the point of playing a roguelike if you're going to cheat?
PixelDungeon,2yg3re,SinksShips,2,Tue Mar 10 05:25:42 2015 UTC,Some people have said that they'd like a single run through so they can see the later levels and bosses; some people think PixelDungeon is too hard and they want to make it a little bit / a lot easier.  People are different and people enjoy different things.

PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,ItsSomethingLikeThat,6,Sun Mar 8 07:46:46 2015 UTC,So many times I forget that the seeds in my inventory are actually pretty useful. Congrats on the win!
PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,Upside-DownFish,5,Sun Mar 8 08:10:33 2015 UTC,I don't think I even know how to use seeds effectively.
PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,foragerr,2,Sun Mar 8 13:04:12 2015 UTC,You generally throw them into the path of an oncoming monster. It will turn into a plant which the monster will walk onto so it helps if you understand exactly how monsters move.  Exceptions are;  The green seeds which you walk into yourself then wait or sleep there until your health is fully restored.  The brown seeds you also use on yourself as they give you a huge armor boost(while rooting you on that spot for a while.) Very useful when fighting DM and goo.  The blue seeds are like a potion of frost and they are useful both against enemies and for turning mystery meat into frozen carpaccio.
PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,jyjjy,6,Sun Mar 8 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Wait... Wait!... Wait!?   Seriously? The green seeds fully restore your health if you wait on them? I always thought they just had minimal effect! Sigh... Fucking stupid, super fun game."
PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,shadowokker,3,Sun Mar 8 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, moving breaks the healing buff. They don't heal you fully, necessarily, just for a really good chunk of HP. At low levels, they'll replenish your HP."
PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,GammaTainted,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, they are the most valuable seed, they'll regenerate you to full health as long as you don't move. You find the bush they make in gardens on occasion as well. Just wait/search/sleep on them killing any enemies that show up in the middle without moving."
PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,jyjjy,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:54:22 2015 UTC,That's awesome. I knew you could use three to create health potions but this makes them much more useful in short supply.
PixelDungeon,2ybjqm,shadowokker,7,Mon Mar 9 04:55:48 2015 UTC,Because I know this sub loved closure; I totally beat him with a surprising amount of health left. +8 blazing knuckledusters ftw.

PixelDungeon,2ycq65,bubblebuttsy,3,Sun Mar 8 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, your chances of success are preeetty slim. I was in this position a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't make it past floor 24 cuz I ran out of Magic Mapping. Here are a couple of tips/reminders to help you along.   Spend all your remaining gold (if you have any) on Magic Mapping scrolls. They will help you find the shortest route to the exit, because you do NOT want to be fighting the enemies down there. Similarly to tip #1, avoid enemies at all costs. If you have to use potions of invisibility, use them. While they are nice to have for the Yog fight, they aren't necessary. Pray to RNGesus that you don't get sandwiched between 2 eyeballs.   Good luck!"
PixelDungeon,2ycq65,Upside-DownFish,2,Sun Mar 8 17:49:06 2015 UTC,What about health potion farming?
PixelDungeon,2ycq65,Upside-DownFish,2,Sun Mar 8 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there are no enemies in the Demon Halls that drop health potions. Even if there was one, I would not recommend it as the other, highly potent, enemies would probably interrupt your farming session and ruin your day."
PixelDungeon,2ycq65,trulte42,6,Sun Mar 8 18:25:00 2015 UTC,Scorpios drop hpots  Probably a bit rarer than from bats.
PixelDungeon,2ycq65,Upside-DownFish,2,Sun Mar 8 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, I never knew that. I guess I never killed enough to ever have one drop because I'm too busy running past them lol"
PixelDungeon,2ycq65,Lucian41,2,Sun Mar 8 21:51:12 2015 UTC,"My day was ruined indeed. Those eyes got me while I was trying to get back to the imp's shop and stock up on potions.  However, I won't give up, I unequipped all my gear before I died except for my weapon. My next character will retrieve that +5 Glaive and shove it right up Yog's ass."

In the meantime while you are looking for an ID scroll, just pump one upgrade into the short sword because you can always reforge it later."

PixelDungeon,2yb1hx,Booona,7,Sun Mar 8 03:50:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on the fight, but generally the idea is that you don't want to move when fighting in these cases, thus mitigating the big downside of wearing heavy armor"
PixelDungeon,2yb1hx,00-Evan,3,Sun Mar 8 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"The key word in the above is move. You don't do that. You stand there and fight, allowing you to receive the better armor bonus with no drawbacks, until the fight is over. Then you put your regular armor back on. This is very useful early on in the game if you find good armor but don't have the strength for it."

PixelDungeon,2y7wr2,s_nut_zipper,2,Sat Mar 7 22:32:41 2015 UTC,"Mimics are magical creatures which can take any shape they wish. In dungeons they almost always choose a shape of a treasure chest, because they know how to beckon an adventurer."

PixelDungeon,2y6b9l,00-Evan,3,Fri Mar 6 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"Some suggestions about the book:  A confirmation dialogue when adding pages might be a good idea. As is you have to check which scrolls it wants, then check your scrolls to see if you have one and remember what symbol is what scroll. Makes it easy to waste a scroll by clicking the wrong symbol, especially if you have a lot of scrolls.  Also I know you have it tend to need scrolls you already have if possible which is convenient but it does so even with unidentified scrolls. Got the book the other day and I had 5 scrolls at the time, two unidentified. Look at the book and it wants 2 scrolls I don't have. Figured it was the two unidentified ones which was correct but it won't add unidentified scrolls so I had to use them to find out what they were then luck into finding another copy many levels later before I could upgrade. I think it would make sense to let it take the unidentified scrolls. Can't see why a book should care if you know what scroll it is as long as it is in fact the one it wants.  Random suggestion: Make reforging via the blacksmith immune to loss of enchantment/glyph like when you reforge the warrior's sword. Also if you are reforging unenchanted gear perhaps let it add the enchantment of the lower level item if it has one?"
PixelDungeon,2y6b9l,jyjjy,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"Can confirm that I too would enjoy a confirmation button for adding new spells to the book.   Perhaps remove identify as a spell and instead have a 4 charge using ""identify"" perk to the book   Edit: list of spells that can be added to the book, not in general"
PixelDungeon,2y6b9l,TheExpandingMind,2,Mon Mar 9 19:58:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. I wasn't equipping it. I just made a gold donation.  Thank you for your awesome mod. I was a hold out until degradation-gate.

PixelDungeon,2y58sb,MoronLessOff,5,Fri Mar 6 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"The ring of might, due to the Rogue's dodge bonus, is probably a better investment for survivability than the plate at this point.  Assassins like damage though, you should probably upgrade that warhammer some so you can get some more powerful ambush attacks."
PixelDungeon,2y58sb,00-Evan,3,Fri Mar 6 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"I was kind of thinking that.  Save a scroll for a Well of Transmutation, and a few others just to get a little more power.  Maybe to +3 or +4, then dump the rest into Might.  Thanks for the insight."
PixelDungeon,2y58sb,jyjjy,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:28:52 2015 UTC,Shouldn't the evasion bonus be the same whether he upgrades the ring or the plate? One raises strength one while the other lowers the requirement one making the difference the same either way.
PixelDungeon,2y58sb,00-Evan,2,Fri Mar 6 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yup, but theres the added benefit of weapon damage and the 5hp."
PixelDungeon,2y58sb,davidsverse,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:30:58 2015 UTC,I would UG the ring  It will help against Monks to have more strength for a backup weapon.

PixelDungeon,2xzitn,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:49:46 2015 UTC,I feel like the crab teaches you how to deal with double movement and the importance of armor. It encouraged the effective use of the cloak of shadows for me.

PixelDungeon,2xzitn,jyjjy,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:12:33 2015 UTC,It feels like the Scorpio is smart enough to avoid going through doors unless it's in a gas field.
PixelDungeon,2xzitn,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:19:41 2015 UTC,Is it really identical? Scorpio seems to simply go away if it can rather often while the trickster never does.
PixelDungeon,2xzitn,jyjjy,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"It is very close, but perhaps slightly off. I'm not entirely sure why but for some reason I didn't copy the scorpion AI and wrote functionally similar code instead. His behaviour shouldn't change significantly or at all, but I'll make the code identical for the sake of consistency."
PixelDungeon,2xzitn,00-Evan,2,Fri Mar 6 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"Cool. He would be a bit ""trickier"" if he backed off sometimes like Scorpio instead of being so relentless. FYI the continue button is still broken when you get stopped mid-journey."
PixelDungeon,2xzitn,jyjjy,2,Fri Mar 6 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"This change should make little to no adjustment to his AI, I appreciate that a trickier enemy is more fun, but the trickster is primarily designed for new players, so his 'trickiness' has to be balanced accordingly.  Also, in what way is the continue button still broken?"
PixelDungeon,2xzitn,NCOSRane,3,Fri Mar 6 21:53:59 2015 UTC,It disappears if you are stopped mid-journey by hunger damage or when you spot a monster.
PixelDungeon,2xzitn,00-Evan,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"There should be a challenge mode with actual smart AI.  Like a warlock who just stands there at the end of a long hallway and waits for you to come through that door instead of waltzing in to be surprise attacked by you.  Or a trickster who does that, and who throws darts into doors to prop them open so he can keep annoying you.  Or a fetid rat who chases you into a room with one door, then stands in the doorway and makes you come to him while his ooze dissolves you."

It does add a lot but if you have spent a decent amount of time with vanilla it shouldn't be overwhelming. Personally I can't stand degradation which makes the choice easier. FYI it is a standalone mod. You can have both installed so  if you want to give shattered a try and decide for yourself you can always just switch back to vanilla if you want and save shattered for later.

PixelDungeon,2xzlho,Monorail5,2,Thu Mar 5 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"I like to use the confusion seed to make enemies fall off catwalks on those levels.  I have found spider meat on the next level down.  Also you get experience when creatures fall.  Its nice instant kill for even the toughest enemies.  Love watching monks, spiders and golems spiralling to their death.  Not sure if potions would survive the landing on the next level down."
PixelDungeon,2xzlho,Monorail5,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:09:15 2015 UTC,Ah! So that must be inaccurate information from the wiki. Thanks for sharing the tip. I'll definitely keep this in mind on my next run.

PixelDungeon,2xy7k0,vantharion,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:34:34 2015 UTC,Is it possible to plant a seed and use it on the next turn without walking off and then back onto it?
PixelDungeon,2xy7k0,duketrf,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:17:12 2015 UTC,That happened to me once in a 5x6 room. I ended up killing them all because of displacement mail +2. I had so much food and experience by the end of it.  Halfway through I got out and ran away before waging guerilla warfare to clear the level.  I was lucky to find a furnace trap room next floor to cook the crab meat.
PixelDungeon,2xyd6q,Joseph000555,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:03:23 2015 UTC,Oh pish-posh. That's just a minor inconvenience if you ask me.
PixelDungeon,2xyd6q,DragonDePlatino,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:17:15 2015 UTC,"1) Walk diagonally right.  2) Throw food at door  3) Throw boomerang at the only rat you can see. (Also, only that rat can see you.)  4) Once you kill it, move down.  5) If anyone of them is awake, move diagonally up-right, if not, wait  6) Kill that rat and go back to step 5, repeat till rats are dealt with.  Regardless of tactic, you will only fight 1 at a time which is fine."
PixelDungeon,2xvnxl,DragonDePlatino,7,Wed Mar 4 05:45:44 2015 UTC,This would be awesome in SD because the roar causes a wand of amok effect.

PixelDungeon,2xvnxl,naaate129,2,Wed Mar 4 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"Good read, m8. Very thought out and thorough. Given the choice I usually choose a battle wand in exchange for the seed so I don't need to worry about that telekinesis trash. I'll definitely give this strategy a go next run. Especially if I find a wand before this mission.  Thanks for sharing!"
PixelDungeon,2xvnxl,RSquared,2,Wed Mar 4 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, TK is bad? You can push enemies off ledges, into traps, grab items in piranha rooms, shove Yog into a corner...  It would be nice that at some point, like, multiples of +3, it pushed enemies an extra square, but it's a pretty handy wand to have.  OTOH, when did poison get considered good? I hate that wand, the damage is minimal."
PixelDungeon,2xvnxl,RSquared,2,Wed Mar 4 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"Wand of Telekinesis might be worse, but it might be better. Poison is not the best wand, but some people might like it more than the rotberry seed. The keyword here is ""subjectively"". ;)"
PixelDungeon,2xvnxl,DisgruntledHamster,2,Wed Mar 4 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I've just never heard anyone subjectively say poison over TK, which is why i was confused and maybe it got a major buff that I should go try it out."
PixelDungeon,2xvnxl,TrillTrill,2,Wed Mar 4 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"Poison is great. In open rooms you can do huge amounts of damage with distance blasts, chisel away pirhana, and compound damage on enemies which require multiple turns to beat."

PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,trulte42,4,Tue Mar 3 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"Shattered PD flair is so lame. This post partially applies to vanilla too, but whatever...  Okay. Wraiths have 1 HP. Fire does more than 1 dmg, and spreads over burnable terrain. By opening some graves, preferably while invisible, and then setting fire to the room (door) while most wraiths are inside, you can get some niiiice satisfaction. Make sure to start with the grave furthest away from the exit.  It's a fun way to take them out, and sort-of easier with larger groups. I accidentaly attacked a wraith on my way out after opening the second grave, otherwise my cloak - as a freerunner - would have made this a really safe thing to do."
PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,Infintinity,2,Tue Mar 3 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"I'm swarming this thread so bear with me, but it's actually safe to start a fire in a diagonal tile while you're still in the room and then moving into it while it's on fire (unless you have ring of haste), as the grass will burn out immediately before you enter the tile."
PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,Concani,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:23:23 2015 UTC,Hmm. That's interesting. And probably a bit useful in cases like these.
PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,Infintinity,3,Wed Mar 4 06:52:42 2015 UTC,"I've had to do some controlled burns on wraiths before, usually when I'm low on health potions. It'll clear them out for sure."
PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,Concani,4,Tue Mar 3 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"It's a really good way of clearing 1-2 graves if you have wand of firebolt or any extra flame potions (usually pretty abundant esp from dwarven city).   Summon the wraiths from 1-2 nearby graves. Start a fire in a diagonal tile. Step into the diagonal tile, even though it appears to be on fire, it will burn out at the same time you enter the tile. Watch as your wraiths are cleansed. PROFIT!"

PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,Monorail5,2,Wed Mar 4 00:19:55 2015 UTC,It's a great way to deal with them but I mostly don't even open the graves there because I don't think it's worth it in most ocasions. Also what is this app that make screen orange called. I know it was answered on this sub many time but I can't recall it's name.
PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,Infintinity,2,Tue Mar 3 21:31:11 2015 UTC,"they have upped the money under them, no longer the insulting 1 gp."
PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,geekygirly,0,Tue Mar 3 22:13:05 2015 UTC,"In every graveyard, only 1 of the gravestones has a prize under it (random potion/scroll/gold) and the other ones have 1 gp under them. Sometimes the prize will already be uncovered (not sure why, maybe it's if a monster spawns over where the gravestone would be), so once you find it you don't have to bother checking the others."
PixelDungeon,2xtlcm,Infintinity,2,Wed Mar 4 00:11:29 2015 UTC,Not anymore in shattered. I've gotten a good 100-150 coins from graveyards now. That amount is definitely worth a couple turns!

Not that I actually use them. And yeah, i have no idea when to use scrolls and pots either  5 - stopping melee enemies from reaching you, and preventing ranged enemies from getting a target. Also disintegration  7 - after eating food, sleep if you have >50% health so you can regenerate. Otherwise, drink a health pot, you're not going to survive long with that little HP anyways  8 - use them all on gnolls and the fetid rat; sewer crabs too fast and rats not worth the effort. All of the other ranged weapons have a use, except for the shuriken which are mostly useless."
PixelDungeon,2xu4nb,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:50:17 2015 UTC,"Mid to high 20s is ideal for Yog. I've had wins between 24-27. In general, try to be a few levels ahead. To Farm, use the ""Health Potion Farming Guide"" in the sidebar. Spending time on those levels (especially the first couple) is a good way to get health pots and exp built up. Also don't drink potions of exp if you're already nearly at a new level, try drink them fresh after levelling. Ankh->Item->Health Pots is all I buy unless I'm swimming in it with ring of wealth or lucky drops. Bombs and bees aren't that important. Handy, but not important. Brew seeds into potions if you don't use them much. I occasionally use a fire or poison seed in addition to the ones you mentioned, and icecap can be good for getting scrolls off flame traps. Scrolls I agree on, there are many that aren't always that useful. You just have to use everything as best you can, might as well use every resource possible to survive. Potions are pretty useful though. Liquid Flame, Toxic Gas, and Frost are pretty useful offensively. Everything has a use somehow though, just ones like Purification are limited (I only use this against DM). Plate armour is usually the right priority. Try to get tier 5 weapons when possible. Wands are sometimes a viable choice, especially the powerful ones like Lightning. I'd usually put 2-3 max into one of those and it becomes pretty damn potent, 1HKs on a lot of enemies and useful for multiples too. Edit: Certain rings, such as haste and evasion, are very worth upgrading. I pretty much don't. You can make some barriers to block off certain enemies but idk if it's that helpful. Get into a corner behind him and hide. Not even kidding. Ideally you want Yog on one side, walls on as many as you can, and larvae spawning in the rest. To get there, try a combination of invis pots, terror/sleep scrolls, wand of blink, wand of slow, etc. Anything that helps you get there faster/quietly, or rearrange the enemies. Eat->Sleep to regen to full. Try fill it in early levels or ones with lots of plants. I didn't know you could bless with an HPP but I wouldn't recommend it. Chuck em at weak shit they aren't that useful. If you're warrior and an enemy is approaching, might as well try get a hit in even just for a point or two. Incen can be potent, as can any source of fire starting. Curare and Javelin can be useful too, whenever you want to chase or run from an enemy."

PixelDungeon,2xta5f,zeruel01,2,Tue Mar 3 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"I was able to beat the game with a Warden first out of the Huntress options. Collect a lot of dew drops and seeds. Use your Dew vial when it gets full.   As far as the boomerang I have only ever upgraded it to +2 at most, often just +1. I end up using the Huntress as a tank type class with scale armor and a really upgraded weapon. Wands are of course all important."
PixelDungeon,2xta5f,Concani,2,Tue Mar 3 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"The warden is just plain bad. All situational.  There is a limited amount of grass in the game. After that, you're pretty much just a huntress who found some extra seeds and dew along the way.  If you're going to tough it with your boomerang, you might as well have been a sniper. If you're running around with some good wands you found, might as well have been a battlemage. If you're running around with a good weapon and armor, might as well have been a gladiator/berserker."
PixelDungeon,2xta5f,NCOSRane,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:04:29 2015 UTC,"The boomerang isn't as useful for the Warden as it is for the Sniper, so I wouldn't really advise using more than one scroll of upgrade on it. Focus more on weapons and armour.  Generally your main focus should be on seeds and dew drops. If you find lots of seeds, you can brew lots of potions (provided you find an Alchemy Pot). The ideal set up for a Warden would be: Good weapon, good armour, Alchemists Toolkit, and a Ring of Herbalism.   It's so very much based on luck though. Just keep trying."

PixelDungeon,2xs7c4,Jaemad,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:46:08 2015 UTC,"Often I find that locked rooms on a level can only be entered by going one level higher and then jumping into the chasm. You land in the locked room, usually with a pile of bones. It's usually good for a suit of armor, a potion, a scroll and the key that unlocks the door of the room you are now in.   tldr; If you are stuck and can't find a key to a room on a level always look one level higher for a chasm to jump from."
PixelDungeon,2xs7c4,Concani,2,Wed Mar 4 16:23:40 2015 UTC,Wow... I always thought that was an error with level generation!!!
PixelDungeon,2xs7c4,Jaemad,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:13:49 2015 UTC,I thought that for the longest time until one fateful day when a mistroke of the touchpad had me hurtling happily into the void. Plummeted down and hit the bottom in a locked room. It usually takes between 1/4 and 1/2 of your health but the loot is often worth it.   Always good to put down a sungrass seed and recharge. Oh and watch for wraiths. It seems like 10% of the time a wraith pops up from the pile of bones but the key is usually on the bottom of the pile.
PixelDungeon,2xs7c4,Concani,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:57:41 2015 UTC,Ahh thanks! I usually stand on top of bone piles when I search them unless I have a wand anyway

PixelDungeon,2xr1wg,sidevvays,2,Tue Mar 3 05:01:34 2015 UTC,Its big use esp. When you have 4 ankhs and a full bottle

PixelDungeon,2xr1wg,OrbisTerre,2,Tue Mar 3 04:44:17 2015 UTC,Theres a limiter in seed and dew spawn in shattered when using Wand of Regrowth.. Ankh is the best investment and use of Dew. You have an extra Life. Plus a regenerative item
PixelDungeon,2xr1wg,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"Haven't used the Ankh in a while, generally found you lost a bunch of items and if you head into the lower levels without at least 5-10 health potions its basically game over.  Over time with wand of regrowth I can get piles of seeds, over 10 each, plus plenty of dew, not sure I've seen a limiter.  Works best with sandals, ring of magic, and being the warden."
PixelDungeon,2xr1wg,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:26:25 2015 UTC,In shattered pixel dungeon. You buy an ankh. And then bless it with a full dew vial. When you die you come back to full health with all items on the spot. So 4 Blessed ankhs. 4 revives with all items on. Unscathe
PixelDungeon,2xovgb,duketrf,2,Mon Mar 2 18:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, this was a change meant to address ankh stacking.  Shop 6 will always spawn an ankh and a weightstone, after this each shop will spawn either an ankh or a weightstone."

PixelDungeon,2xlgtd,geekygirly,4,Mon Mar 2 00:26:24 2015 UTC,It's not an acronym. It's just a list of the letters that were capitalized in the signs in OP's screenshots. I'm curious as to whether it's the same each playthrough or if there is more to whatever code it is than just those letters that are nonsense at first glance.

Surprisingly, this is actually a source issue, you can look here, lines 805-843: https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon/blob/master/src/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/hero/Hero.java  The switch statement doesn't include a break on battlemage, so a battlemage would also be able to get the sniper's buff. This was probably fixed in 1.7.5a, I think the source is just 1.7.5.  Thanks for pointing this out, i'll include a fix in 0.2.4c when that comes out.  edit: just tested and nope, looks like it's also an issue in vanilla pd v1.7.5a"
PixelDungeon,2xlmsh,00-Evan,1 point,Sun Mar 1 21:48:50 2015 UTC,"Well then. I suppose this has gone unnoticed (if it existed back then) before because it earlier was an enemy debuff  Also, what about the fact that missile weapons are/were equippable as a rogue? Is that intentional? And if I remember correct, I have noticed that rogues (at least assassins] have the same ranged bonus thing as the sniper, being faster at throwing javelins and stuff so that the enemy occasionaly ""stops"" when it probably should have moved. Mage didn't have any of this the last time I checked - this is all in previous versions, I don't know if it still is a case.  And I was a battlemage in this disastrous run, so the reason for the bug is valid."

PixelDungeon,2xicka,Pinetarball,2,Sun Mar 1 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"Well, speaking as someone who just figures it out as he goes, I personally always use the gladiator mastery, and in the event I see numerous enemies I just situate myself in a corner or other small area so that I have a constant adjacent space occupied and I'm able to really wrack up the combos, otherwise, a lot of it is luck. Just play the character to that character's strengths and avoid their weak spots.    I like to think that I have some good general tips for the bosses Yog-Dzewa and Dwarf King. With Yog-Dzewa, you'll probably have found all the different kinds of potions by that point, so if you can lure both the hands into one area and get both hands paralyzed momentarily or somehow put distance between yourself and them, then you can keep them pretty well occupied with a potion of paralytic gas while you go and shove yourself in a corner next to Yog-Dzewa. Using his larvae as a shield, the fists can't get to you. This tactic is heavily reliant on potions, though.   With the Dwarf King, a really nice trick is having a good Eldritch weapon and some ranged (although warrior shouldn't use thrown ranged as he has a debuff with thrown weapons [the exception to this is when the monster is stunned paralyzed or asleep]) . Just situate yourself between the pedestals, where the dwarf king has to be located in order to summon any skeletons, and then make him scared. The Eldritch part overrides the dwarf king's urge to summon any minions so that he runs away from his true source of power."

PixelDungeon,2xdxxs,mrmurraybrown,3,Fri Feb 27 22:55:16 2015 UTC,Try to survive leaner on the early floors. Meaning maybe don't upgrade that tier 3 item and wait for another drop.   Always fight in doors to get that free surprise attack.   Rings are good. Accuracy is helpful for short fights but the elemental resistance is nice too.   The nature of the game being roguelike is sometimes you don't get great items.
PixelDungeon,2xdxxs,mrmurraybrown,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:22:21 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the advice I'll try to implement it but to be honest I don't know of the door tactic. Is the monster in the door and you hit them or am I in the door to hit them?
PixelDungeon,2xdxxs,Natinals,2,Sat Feb 28 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"Monster in the door:  Lead them to a clear room. You go in and through door, but stay beside the door. The door will close, and then open when monster gets there. The first swing you take counts as a surprise attack and you can't miss.     This is a tactic you must use to beat the blue crab for the ghost."

PixelDungeon,2xaj3w,JoshuMertens,2,Fri Feb 27 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"Until you start unlocking manuals, the warrior is your best bet for the extra strength and love of food. But once you start getting the swim of things and unlock subclasses, ASSASSIN ALL THE WAY. Assuming your ring of shadows is decent, a strong assassin will get a one-hit-kill on most shit just by running through a door. This ability becomes stronger as you progress. The real game breaker for this guy though, and it's super fucking cheesy, is a bug in the current version that allows you to get his attack bonus at ANY time simply by closing the game while you're adjacent to an enemy. As many times as you want.  Tl;dr you can cheat with assassin"

PixelDungeon,2xaii4,Jaemad,2,Fri Feb 27 13:34:49 2015 UTC,I think so. It's by far the hardest area and the one or two upgrade scrolls you'll get aren't worth half your healing potions.  Magic mapping and invisibility
PixelDungeon,2xaii4,BobbleBobble,2,Thu Feb 26 23:53:46 2015 UTC,It is the best thing to do. Save your magic mapping for them. But if you feel like you need more upgrades i suggest trying to find it and run as fast as you can.
PixelDungeon,2xaii4,umarnobbee,2,Thu Feb 26 23:59:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. I lost 2 runs level 24 because I have the habit of clearing the entire dungeons.

There is also one interesting aspect of this stage: it has less stength and upgrade potions than other stages, and no more shops later on. There is just no need to seach rooms there, the best you can find is ONE upgrade scroll which is not even guaranteed. And you don't need strength potion this far down anymore."

Used mind vision liberally to avoid fights and rushed. Got to boss with hardly any life and health pot spent. Beat fists with 3 honey pots and 6 bombs. They never touched me. Remaining 3 bombs on eye with bees finishing him off. Worms  spent my dew vial but was able to finish them with bees help. Most satisfying win in a long time.

I'm quite certain I tested this indev, but clearly the code I pushed has this fault.   Will roll a fix for this into the next patch, good news is that your existing spellbook's charges should be corrected by the fix for this.  edit: also, the spellbook is the slowest charging artifact in the game, it should still charge, just needs time."

PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,Lost_in_Thought,3,Sat Feb 21 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"Couple thoughts I have. (I no means have a 75% win rate but probably 1/10?)  1) play greedy, don't use upgrade scrolls in the first section unless you find a end tier item. You will lose more in levels 1-10 but you will win more overall. Cause some games you can't win. That's fine, if your blowing all your healing pots and two upgrade scrolls to kill tangu end games not happening. 2) play warrior. By far the easiest/simpilist for a first win 3) use walking through doors for guarenteed hits."
PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,urza5589,3,Sat Feb 21 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"Yesterday i won for the first time after 170 runs (regular pd, not shattered). How did I won? I played assassin. I found a animated statue with a blazing glaive early in the game. I started piling up all scrolls of upgrade on it and using it behind doors even though my strength was low. It worked. A lot. I even beat goo that way. Eventually I found two plate armors and one was +2 or +3. I saved my upgrades and used them just before degradation kicked in. That's key. I used all doors to my advantage. Scrolls of enchantment only on weapon because applied on armor can fuck you up, and using them to avoid degradation too. Eventually with the glaive at +7 I got enchantment of tempered so I focused on improving my armor. It turns out that a run can give you a lot of scrolls of upgrade. They're key. And yes, you need to be lucky to win, but you need to avoid useless risks. Eventually you'll win.  Oh, and assassins are by far the best class. Why? Dodge bonus is insanely useful and surprise hits allow you to efficiently use weapons above your strength."
PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,niviss,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:23:59 2015 UTC,"What's this strategy of ""using doors""?"
PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,Booona,2,Sun Feb 22 04:14:59 2015 UTC,"When a monster enters a door (when he's on the door tile), you have a guaranteed hit against him. So a common strategy is to kite the monsters trough doors, and hit them when they're on the door tile."
PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,AmpyeriDracula,2,Sun Feb 22 04:43:21 2015 UTC,At this point I probably win 75% of the time as long as I get past the goo. The key is getting decent armor early. A way to make this more likely is using the ghost properly. Don't take your reward as soon as you can. Wait until you have cleared out the sewers and are ready for goo then go back and get it. You should be level 6 or 7 at that point and it will increase your odds of getting a good reward. Always ask for armor unless you've gotten a really lucky find in that area already.  As for starvation I rarely find it a problem. You should be eating food only when you are both starving and your health is below 2/3rds or so or you are wasting its regenerative effects. An important note about food is that going up and down stairs goes through a lot of it with no regenerational effects so back tracking is best done while starving so you aren't wasting food and it is best to eat when you know you will be on a level for a while.  BTW if you just want a win for the sake of having done so all you have to do is upgrade a fire wand as it becomes ridiculously powerful the more you upgrade it. Last time I did this by the end I beat the fists and yog with just two shots each.
PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,jyjjy,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:10:57 2015 UTC,How do you level that much? I wasn't around levels after clearing them and Ann forced to leave for hunger concerns quickly.
PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,jyjjy,3,Tue Feb 24 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"By the time I'm ready for goo I'm usually at least at level 5 then I'll purposely fight a bit more to get to the next level if I'm close to it. I explore thoroughly and search most walls in rooms for hidden doors. Leveling helps your max health, accuracy and dodge for the fight with goo as well. For vanilla night fighting will help you get there and a darkness level in Shattered helps as well. Hopefully the things I mentioned above about eating will let you use food better to avoid starvation issues.   FYI rogues naturally need less food, using warlock as a mage gives you a food boost with every kill, warrior gains health when you eat so wait until your health is even lower than I said above to do so and with huntress use your boomerang to kill all the piranhas for bonus mystery meat from each one(plus you can then keep the potion of invisibility.) Every time you are at max health and not starving you should consider that to mean you have wasted food. BTW sleeping in gardens maximizes the regeneration from food and wells of health not only heal you but also remove all hunger/starvation(and remove curses from everything in your inventory) so only use them when your health is very low and you are starving."
PixelDungeon,2wnrzz,CoolJoe16,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:46:54 2015 UTC,Watch playthroughs of people beating the game. Observe how they use items and how they fight enemies. That should give you a few tips on how to play effectively.

As for the others, you have some good ideas here but ultimately it will be up to the developer whether to implement them or not.

Paging /u/00-Evan for comment"

PixelDungeon,2wmlyo,00-Evan,1 point,Sun Feb 22 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry for the holdup, I'm doing a dev sprint to try and get the next update out tonight or tomorrow. I do get a lot of messages and suggestions, but that isn't a bad thing. Feedback and ideas are really important, especially from the perspective of lower ranking players, as I tend to only get detailed messages from vets.  The idea I was already implementing was shattered potions. Potions will break when a player is affected by freezing (I'm going to make more use of this debuff in future), and a new container called the Potion Bandolier will prevent this, as well as carry potions.  Rather than changing gold denominations, I feel like it makes more sense to simply improve the drops of disappointing lone gold pieces. I'm changing shops in the next update, so there is opportunity for those.  A magical item that lets you to turn enemies into allies in some way is definitely on the table. I don't have plans for anything relating to necromancy just yet, but expect at least something relating to more allies in the wand rework.  If I do put in a 3rd misc. slot, it would definitely be tied to an unlock of some kind. It's a significant boost in power so it makes a lot more sense for something like that to be something the player earns.   The best way to get ideas to me is to email them to me: Evan@ShatteredPixel.com. While obviously I don't implement everything that's suggested, a lot of ideas contain useful bits and pieces that very often do get re-purposed and make it into the game.   As for the art, everything that isn't present in vanilla PD is done by me, I try my best to keep the art style consistent. Everything else is done by Watabou for the original game."

PixelDungeon,2wk57r,kreionysus,-1,Sat Feb 21 01:39:57 2015 UTC,The bat is a mob in the caves levels. The joke is that the brute and bat both noticed me when I walked in but the shaman was still sleeping. Hence the shaman having a rough day.
PixelDungeon,2wk57r,v3xx,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:02:26 2015 UTC,I'm still totally lost. Everything you said is completely normal and happens a hundred times a day.

PixelDungeon,2wa64d,Alterblade,13,Wed Feb 18 05:21:05 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes, Android only.  Long answer:  Watabou posted a long time ago about possibly releasing an iOS version, but nothing about it since then. (And that post was one year ago, to this day.)  However, the good news is that since the source code for the game is released, some people have been working on porting it to other platforms. There is a multiplatform desktop version that runs on Java available for free download here, created by Twitter user @Arcnor using the released source code. There is also the possibility that another user may port the game over to iOS. AFAIK @Arcnor's code will work with iOS, but nobody has done it yet.  So your best bet if you want to play is to use the desktop version. Note: the desktop version is about three versions behind the latest version. Some users would argue that the game was better three versions ago, but that's a completely different topic."

However, Goo itself will heal up slowly while on water. Therefore, try to stay on water while keeping the goo dry.  Once you've found a good spot, planting a seed of Earthroot (the brown one) and walking onto it can be really helpful to tank his attacks."
PixelDungeon,2wa7o4,mcdg2,3,Wed Feb 18 08:33:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on the items and seeds you have. In order of priority,  1) Have Earthroot seed?  Plant seed in water and make sure where Goo is standing is not water.(Water heals Goo)   2) Have decent leather armor +X/ Mail Armor and better?  Equip your best Armor(even if you don't have the strength) and duke it out in one spot. As long as you don't move, there is no penalty.  3) Have fire seed/poison seed/fire wand/potion?  Use it!  4) Lousy luck with equipment?  Just pump all your upgrade into your best weapon and hope you can murder Goo before it murders you. Throw your fire potions at it."

PixelDungeon,2wa7o4,justfarmingdownvotes,2,Wed Feb 18 14:00:33 2015 UTC,"Having an earthroot seed helps, basicallly makes you immune to physical damage (against bosses it just makes you resistant, plant either behind doorway, on water to wash off the caustic ooze goo inflicts on you) Use seeds to make traps for him on his way toward you (firebloom, poison) Use strongest weapon you have for a surprise attack (behind doors, sleeping etc, may cause a few turns to be lost but with luck will inflict some big damage)  I have nothing else I can tell you..You have to have luck on your side, Good Luck. :)"
PixelDungeon,2wa7o4,umarnobbee,1 point,Wed Feb 18 12:03:15 2015 UTC,"Usually you want to try and find a door next to water to fight him. Stand in the door, hopefully he won't notice you. Plant a seed of fire or poison under you if you have them. Plant an earthroot seed behind you on the water if you have it. Attack him from afar with any projectile weapons or potions. Throw more seeds in his path to hurt him or confuse him. When he gets near you, step back through the door onto the earthroot seed and have him step onto whatever seed you planted in the door. Now he will be on dry land which can't heal him and you get a free hit that will always land. Then keep hitting him and hope for the best.  TLDR: The goo is really all about the seeds, or just being lucky and finding great gear early on."
PixelDungeon,2wa7o4,portezbie,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:30:25 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to kill him is to get a bunch of bombs. You want to make sure to keep him off the water, cause he can heal there. And avoid his power attack that he charges up when he gets the !!! over him.   Like everyone else here is saying seeds are your friend, too. A healing potion is nice to have."

I would love to see players use a diversity of weapons similar to how they use a diversity of artifacts based on their play style or synergies.

PixelDungeon,2vxvjh,00-Evan,12,Sun Feb 15 07:30:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, well that would explain why it's never happened to me before. Neat."
PixelDungeon,2vxvjh,leozux,8,Sun Feb 15 08:29:19 2015 UTC,He gives the best one in terms of defense or tier? For example if he generates a plate armor and a +1 scale would I get the scale or the plate?
PixelDungeon,2vxvjh,00-Evan,3,Sun Feb 15 12:46:56 2015 UTC,"best in terms of upgrade, meaning all 4 armors were -1 or worse."

PixelDungeon,2vvfe3,harnov,2,Sun Feb 15 02:48:15 2015 UTC,"The formula for the score is goldCollected + (heroLevel * current dungeon depth * 100).  If you win, your score is doubled.  I agree, it's a pretty rough ranking system."

PixelDungeon,2vvgcc,00-Evan,1 point,Sat Feb 14 14:53:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you decided to use the book, how helpful did you find it? I'm considering buffing it as little in the next update."
PixelDungeon,2vvgcc,JoshTriplett,4,Mon Feb 16 00:07:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've found the unstable spellbook one of the least useful artifacts.  The only use I've found for it is using magic mapping on every floor to look for hidden rooms I've missed.  The occasional identify is rarely useful due to randomness (and thus not actually having an item around to identify).  Psionic blast is worse, since it actually hurts the player.  It's too random to count on for remove curse, or pretty much any other scroll.  The only one I've found less useful is Cape of Thorns, because the cape doesn't seem to add any actual armor, and it auto-activates rather than saving up a charge.  If I could activate it at-will when charged, it'd be useful."
PixelDungeon,2vvgcc,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Feb 16 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"The cape of thorns is in a bad spot for a couple reasons. I don't want to give up on the core design just yet, but I feel like one of the biggest reasons people dislike it is because that it's only really useful up until floor 20, floors 22-25 simply have too many magic users. I want to rebalance the demon halls to be a bit more mixed in terms of enemy style, which should hopefully make the cape more useful.  As for the spellbook, I have decided to buff it. It's going to get more charges to start out while still gaining the same amount per level. Additionally psionic blast is getting another little notch down in the self damage department. It will now deal damage based on your current hp, which should preserve its self-harm without making it as likely to kill you."
PixelDungeon,2vvgcc,Gamertag1236547,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:10:47 2015 UTC,I doubt that will make it much more useful. The spellbook is to random for serius use in battle. It's too easy to get remove curse from it when you need rage or fright
PixelDungeon,2vvgcc,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Feb 18 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"The intention is that you'll probably have to read once or twice to get a scroll with an effect you want, more if you want something specific.

PixelDungeon,2vvgcc,Gamertag1236547,1 point,Mon Feb 16 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"I do agree that two misc. slots are a bit tight now. I'm considering allowing for three, but this would make the player stronger, it's something that needs to be balanced properly.  I've specifically designed most artifacts to discourage juggling, which I don't think is very much fun, you should be thinking on what works best and sticking with 2-3 misc. items."
PixelDungeon,2vvgcc,zeruel01,1 point,Mon Feb 16 20:03:33 2015 UTC,I agree with evan. I feel that two spaces is perfect as it is. Imagine chalice + horn + boots. That combo would be virtually indestructible when leveled up.

PixelDungeon,2vvuza,leozux,2,Sat Feb 14 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"Coming up with custom ranking organization is largely the intention of the hall of heroes, which is a $10 donation feature in shattered.

PixelDungeon,2vptm4,VeradilGaming,2,Sat Feb 14 07:03:25 2015 UTC,"An extreme case like having a cloth armor at dwarven city is not related with upgrading armor being better than upgrading the weapon, I rarely upgrade my plate over the level I  needed based on the str I had when I found it, overall just by the way damage works in this game a +12 weapon and a +5 armor are by far more effective than the other way around, while a +10 weapon, +3 armor and +3 ring of evasion/haste are also much better, also he should not upgrade a chain armor playing shattered (since there is less scrolls because of not having degradation) neither the sword anyway, but still, I'd persist on my point, unless you're upgrading an early found plate, or got a very good enchantment on your weapon and no rings I see no situation where I'd upgrade armor over a weapon."

PixelDungeon,2vqq2z,causa-sui,3,Fri Feb 13 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Reading the wiki helps a heck of a lot. There are all kinds of miscellaneous facts that come in really handy, that would take forever to notice if you just did run after run. For instance, did you know that every level with fish, one of the potions on the level will be an invisibility potion? So if you see a fish room and then find an unidentified potion, there's a good chance that it's invisibility - so drink it first when you're going to attempt to traverse that room!  Lots of little stuffs like that add up into wins. Especially with Yog-Dzewa, having a plan in advance before you fight him makes a world of difference. If you go in there having no idea what to expect, you're fried chicken. (I won't spoil it though if you're trying to figure everything out on your own.)  FWIW, I always have found it easiest to win with Berserker. I'm not sure if that's just because the style makes more sense to me or what, but I find that warriors have by far the best chances of getting past goo, and berserker can save up lots of food because he's more effective in combat when starving."

As Freerunner you can literally run circles around goo in the little room where he spawns; so with good use of seeds and projectiles Goo is probably easier for Freerunner than any other class. I'm not as good with the mage or huntress. My limited experience with the huntress is that it's a crapshoot depending on how good the drops you got were before you reached Goo.

Then when I finally got there, I did about 10 damage per turn, and took 25. He still had 75% of his hp left when I had used all my blessed ankhs and health potions.   Rip Mage 2015 - 2015"
PixelDungeon,2vonyw,NinjaDerpy,2,Fri Feb 13 05:23:23 2015 UTC,"You should always save a potion of mind vision, a potion of invisibility, and a seed of earthroot to fight Yog-Dzewa. Use both potions right as you step off the platform and run next to Yog-Dzewa. Wait for the fists to try to look for you and then throw the seed on nearby water. Attack the shit out of the eye until you are completely surrounded by the larvae; the fists can't get to you, and the Earthroot nearly negates larvae damage. Proceed to kill the Yog-Dzewa and then the rest of the larvae. If you have a scroll of lullaby or rage, use it once you kill the Yog-Dzewa because it'll make it easier to deal with the larvae."

Once you're set up next to the eye, toss the paralysis potion in the general direction of where the fists went to buy a lot more time getting your cocoon going."

PixelDungeon,2vng90,Dmn98,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:17:45 2015 UTC,how about enchant or weightstone?  i also wonder if the monks can disarm the pickaxe
PixelDungeon,2vm87j,ryanfranke,3,Thu Feb 12 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"It's a difficult choice but I have to go with the knuckleduster.  Pros   Always hits twice a turn.  Can hit thrice per turn if you weight it. Synchronizes very well with Gladiator, Combo goes up very quickly. Monks can't make you fumble it. Common item   Cons   Weak. Even with Gladiator Combo damage. Don't be surprised to land a lot of 0's on your target. Prone to cause mistakes, what with mashing attack and all. Lots of upgrades required for endgame damage capability. Damage output is dependant on armour upgrades: You can't hit them if you're dead or using a health pot every other turn"
PixelDungeon,2vm87j,TheCanadianAlligator,3,Thu Feb 12 04:55:50 2015 UTC,"Lets compare stats of the +0 state.  Knuckleduster does 3 dmg at twice the speed  Dagger does 4.5 dmg with additional 20% accuracy (4.5 * 120% = 5.4)  Short sword does 5.5 dmg.  As you can tell they are quite balanced, but it seems knukleduster is better right? Not always  Here is my case why the Short Sword is the 'best' imo.   1) Dagger does have 20% accuracy improvement, however 5.5 dmg > 5.4 dmg. (For higher levels, the extra accuracy is negated by the next point) 2) Surprise attacks have 100% accuracy which favours the higher damage weapon (short sword). Even tho you might get 2 hits with the Knuckleduster with a surprise attack, in practice only 50% of the time you have the extra hit (This is because half the time you are ahead of the mobs by 0.5 steps) 3) When calculating damage, damage reduction occurs. Eg, your attack has a damage roll of 1, but the target has a reduction of 2, you do 0 damage. This damage reduction favours a higher minimum damage weapon, ie the short sword. 4) Most of you consider Knuckleduster best because it can last you all the way to Yog. But in PD, which section do you die most? Most veterans will say the early stages(sewers esp). Hence I will argue that it is more essential to have a good early weapon than a late game weapon. The short sword isn't the best but it is sufficient to bring you past Goo. 5) Item degradation makes knuckledusters decay faster than short sword for the same amount of damage. 6) A knuckleduster gains +2dps per upgrade. Isn't that the same as a tier 2 weapon? The major benefit is against monks, but that's all. The short sword gives you a different late game benefit in the form of an extra scroll you can reforge 7) Reforging + hero remains allow you to use a previous run's short sword as an upgrade scroll! It isn't limited to warriors, but you can give the short swords to your other classes in vanilla (I think shattered doesn't allow this anymore)"
PixelDungeon,2vm87j,gohjohn,4,Thu Feb 12 10:03:32 2015 UTC,"The knuckleduster is great when it's upgraded. It's already fast but once you give it a speed weightstone, it doesn't even give some enemies a chance to get a hit in. The best part is that monks can't knock it out of your hand."
PixelDungeon,2vm87j,a_real_doozy,5,Thu Feb 12 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"Another strategy with it is use the gladiator, get that weapon, make it grim or stunning, and enjoy combo damage!"
PixelDungeon,2vm87j,leozux,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"Knuckleduster is the best tier 1 weapon, simply because its the only one which can go all the way to beating yog, it's not the best weapon early game because of the low damage and the lack of rings and upgrades, but its for sure the only single tier 1 weapon that actually gives you advantages over endgame weapons, also with a ring of haste, wand of slow and balanced for speed you can easily take creatures at any depth without getting hit once, also it goes very well with almost any enchantment."

PixelDungeon,2vm87j,Gamertag1236547,1 point,Mon Feb 16 23:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'd have to go with short sword. Knuckleduster is a rather decent weapon when upgraded and enchanted, but I never take them very far. Yes, they do put out two attacks for every turn, but they tend to miss quite often, so one must be overleveled to use it effectively."

PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,garretos,10,Wed Feb 11 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"The Berserker subclass - unlocked after beating the level 10 boss with the Warrior - makes the game much easier by giving huge damage boosts when you have ~40% or less health.  When using the Weightstone, always go for speed over accuracy. Unless you have a warhammer, in which case more power to you.  Be careful using arcane styluses Scrolls of Enchantment! You can get royally screwed by getting a crap glyph and not having another scroll to revert it. If all else fails, slapping an Upgrade scroll or two on the armor usually erases the glyph. This works for beneficial glyphs too, though, so be careful.  EDIT: Ignore the above paragraph, apparently in the newest version there are no arcane styluses. Scrolls of Enchantment apparently became possible to find instead, and now work on armor. Still, be careful using those.  Finally, save one or two Strength potions or Upgrade scrolls in case you find the game's one allotted Well of Transmutation. These items, thrown into the well, become Potions of Might, adding a +5 bonus to your max HP, along with the standard +1 Strength, and Scrolls of Weapon Upgrade, which add an enchantment to a weapon along with +1 to its rank.  EDIT: Almost forgot! Make sure to fill up the Dew Vial while still in the Sewer floors. It's a lifesaver. If you max it out, it'll refill your health to max if you take a fatal hit, emptying the vial in the process. Incredibly useful in floors 22-25, or just as a Plan B when things go wrong."
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,TheChrono,2,Wed Feb 11 17:49:23 2015 UTC,I disagree about the beserker subclass. Use the rogue assassin. Abuse the shit out of the door mechanics leading to free crits.  Realistically I can win about 50% of all my rogue assassin runs.
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,Lost_in_Thought,6,Wed Feb 11 22:45:13 2015 UTC,The problem is getting to assassin with the rogue.
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,TheChrono,-1,Thu Feb 12 00:00:06 2015 UTC,If you can't get assassin with rogue then I wouldn't expect you to beat the game with any other class.
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,TheChrono,3,Thu Feb 12 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"Never said you couldn't abuse the door. And I don't do well with the rogue playstyle. I get caught out too frequently without anything resembling a good weapon. -1 Strength and a worse starter weapon compared to the Warrior = not fun times for me. If you can do the rogue, good for you. You're better than I am at this. Just saying the Warrior is easier for new players."
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,leozux,3,Thu Feb 12 02:53:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's easier for new players. You start out with an upgradable weapon that destroys early-game monsters. But I think when it comes down to actually beating the game, the assassin class is just the best class to do it. Mainly due to critting whenever you go around a corner or through a door."

Generally if I find one I make it my main weapon if I am playing gladiator. A miss with one doesn't necessarily stop your combo."
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,ryanfranke,6,Wed Feb 11 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"Knuckledusters are almost as worthless as the Arcane Stylus.   Both are carried around and sold at a shop ASAP.  [I have to admit I've never really considered the ""can't be knocked out of your hands"" thing, but still, the damage is so shitty... and there's no way I'm wasting upgrade scrolls on it.]"
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,TheCanadianAlligator,3,Thu Feb 12 01:27:07 2015 UTC,"I've beaten the game with them. What you don't realize is that either of the two swings of the knuckleduster counts for one swing of any other weapon. Combined with the fact that gladiator has a damage buff for every hit, either of the two swings count for a continuous hit. So basically you can miss once with the knuckleduster and keep the buff going if you hit the next one. Leading to always getting two really big hits before the other guy had a chance to hit once most of the time. It seems like it hits low but you have to consider the double output.  I haven't seen that either option on the weightstone is good for the knuckleduster though. Making it hit harder takes away the only advantage it has, then it just becomes another dagger. Making it faster reduces the damage to very low levels, making the gameplay very tedious.  It's actually a really good weapon if you get lucky pretty much like anything else in this game. I'd say it's pretty well balanced against probably even T4 weapons with upgrades but really, i would definitely only use it as a gladiator. That's the big caveat right there I guess."
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,ryanfranke,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:32:42 2015 UTC,"No, they may not be the best but they are highly underrated. You get an average of 3 points per hit, but you get two hits, so that's 6 points per turn. Furthermore, if you miss, you still have a second chance!"
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,TheDon835,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:59:33 2015 UTC,"Knuckledusters are like two wet paper towels. Really the only way you harm things with it is by lightly slapping them over and over, making uncomfortably moist. However, Gladiators have refined the art of slapping things over and over, and make their target uncomfortably moist very quickly."
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,urza5589,3,Sun Feb 15 23:15:15 2015 UTC,"I had no clue that couldn't be knocked out of you hands. That's a small, but neat feature!"

PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,urza5589,5,Thu Feb 12 03:01:19 2015 UTC,My friend was a similar boat to you. The advice I gave him that helped the most was don't try and clear the last set of levels. Once you best the dwarf look king use map scrolls and just run through asap. Also if you have problems with ghosts (little black guys) you auto hit if you kite then through a door as it's a surprise attack and they only have 1hp.
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,Lost_in_Thought,4,Wed Feb 11 18:41:24 2015 UTC,"If you shouldn't clear the last few levels, how come I see most people at level 22+ when beating the last boss? How do you get that high without either running out of food, or clearing each level?   I'm in the same boat as op. Been playing this since before they added levels 15+, yet I have never beaten it. Furthest is level 22"
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,urza5589,2,Wed Feb 11 20:43:53 2015 UTC,In my experience you can hit level 24/5/6 before hitting the last section of levels. I just cleared a run a two days ago at level 24 and I did my best avoid fights the whole last section. Also in my opinion don't fight the bosses hands. Just get to the eye while invis and start beating on it. God's larva will surround you and they are much weaker then the hands. Then you just need enough damage/health pots.  If you say exactly where you struggle maybe we can give more pointed advice?
PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,leozux,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"I can generally get past tengu, occasionally the robot, and I only killed the dwarf king once.

PixelDungeon,2vjqg6,valgrid,3,Wed Feb 11 23:59:16 2015 UTC,I guess I would say save all your upgrade scrolls until you find a end game weapon and/or armor. There your most important item you can't afford to waste any early.

The order is what matters.  If you ever played the game of 'cows and bulls' you'll get the idea.  A perfect reaction is when 1 of 3 potions is in the correct place in the mixture. A good reaction is when a potion is present in the mixture, but in the wrong order. No reaction is when that potion does not belong to the catalyst/mixture at all.  Get all in the perfect order, and you have a +10 toolkit (which will probably give 1 potion per seed in alchemy)."

I honestly had a blast with that warden run. She was so incredibly tanky, between barkskin from the wand of regrowth, and herbal armor from the grieves of nature and plate armor+6 of entanglement. I was using a +3 mace until halfway through the dwarven halls when I finally found a better weapon. I could literally just stand there and trade blows with pretty much anything.  The deamon halls were a breeze with the regrowth. I spammed it everywhere, so the scorpions wouldn't have any lines of sight. The eyes were still being eyes. Succubi presented an interesting challenge though; entanglement + love = i can't do anything while they slap me around. they didn't do much damage due to all the buffs, so I couldn't help but feel like I was in their sex dungeon or something XD"

PixelDungeon,2vhkrq,STaY_TUNeD,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:53:56 2015 UTC,"Hi! This is definitely a good video, and it will show beginners that there are many options to beat Goo and that it's not such a hard thing. Just be creative with what you've got in the inventory !  I have to point out some things though:  -You would really benefit from standing in water during the fight because it cures the debuff applied by the Goo. The best setup is: you are standing in water and Goo is not.  -Didnt you actually have ranged weapons ? You have some staffs that you could zap on him to wake him up. Or is it that in newer versions you can't zap wands until they are identified ? In this case you could have tried to identify one of the wands. (I genuinely don't know, I stopped playing much some patches ago). But w/e, you found a way.  -You had 3 earthroot seed which is huge, you could have made a path of it and you would step on a new one when the previous one is consumed. Though I'm pleased that you didn't because it would make the fight way too easy, and not very educational which is the purpose of the video.  -And finally, if RNG god is with you and you happen to fight the Goo in a long corridor WITHOUT WATER, you can kite it and avoid the big attacks. When the big attack is coming, run away (IIRC you have to be 2 squares away from him when it applies damage). Then he'll run at you to keep fighting. Rinse and repeat as long as there's no water behind you."
PixelDungeon,2vhkrq,mentatf,1 point,Wed Feb 11 07:21:08 2015 UTC,"Great tips. They were 2 Wands of Blink that's why I said i didn't have any ranged weapons. i don't really think about these kind of things and that's how i usually beat the game. Pure luck I guess. My best friend as soon as he gets into a hard situation, he will think his ass off and then he dies. I do the opposite and most of the times beat the game. It's a strategy i can't explain."
PixelDungeon,2vhkrq,mentatf,1 point,Wed Feb 11 10:09:11 2015 UTC,"I guess there are others things you do well. The game is about optimizing everything, and there's no reaction time implied since it's turn-based. The more you work out the best ways, the higher win rate you will get.  However it might be true that having a better win rate against the Goo does not imply beating the game more often... because if you manage to beat it with almost nothing, it means you are likely to starve slowly in the next levels, this or the skeleton will end up harassing you to death >:(."

I used to spend hours per day playing this game, just like you did, but then some personal issues started rising up and I had to quit.   Right now I have a mage on level 14,  and he's doing good. Have you heard about Shattered Pixel Dungeon? It's a modded version that doesn't have the item degradation and has many new items and stuff like that. It's worth a download, especially if you don't like the item degradation."
PixelDungeon,2vgkhk,VeradilGaming,2,Tue Feb 10 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"Nice! What was your highest level? Most of my games end before level 5, but when they do go past it, they always get to level 10+. I've found that if I reach Goo or Tengu, I normally have no problem beating them.  I've heard about and looked into Shattered a little bit, but I was thinking about waiting until I beat Pixel Dungeon before I start playing mods. I am seriously reconsidering that decision now that I realize how long it will most likely take me to beat it."
PixelDungeon,2vgkhk,VeradilGaming,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"I've made it to the final boss thrice, and actually even beaten him once! 8 was just an average, I rarely get past the sewers but when I do I usually get to around 15.  Shattered doesn't really change too much, and since it has a different .apk, you can use it alongside normal pixel dungeon, and it won't affect your game / saves in any way"
PixelDungeon,2vgkhk,VeradilGaming,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:47:30 2015 UTC,"Oh nice! Sounds like you've had some pretty successful runs. How long since you started playing do you think it took to beat it?  I'm sorry, did you just say saves? I was under the impression you couldn't save. If you can, I need to figure out how!"
PixelDungeon,2vgkhk,henrebotha,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:05:50 2015 UTC,"It took me about a month to beat it, but I was already familiar with the genre thanks to Nethack and other rogue-likes.   Well, if your phone is rooted, I think there's a way to access the save files and manually save the game, but I really meant the saves that happen when you exit the game so that the character is still there when you come back"

Basically life was harsh during those times where if you couldnt find anything useful, you might as well restart cuz there ain't any way you are getting pass Goo.  I only play during my train ride to University.  My first victory was at my 100+ game because i got lucky with EQs. With all the new changes, there is really only two outcomes nowsaday.

PixelDungeon,2vadg3,harnov,9,Mon Feb 9 13:48:40 2015 UTC,I've stopped using the knuckledusters because it's basically a guaranteed win. At +9 with an enchantment they're so fast and powerful it wrecks just about everything before they can even move. Not to mention monks are a joke with them.
PixelDungeon,2vadg3,itsayatta,16,Mon Feb 9 14:07:38 2015 UTC,Looks like I can finally beat the game

PixelDungeon,2vb0ne,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:03:00 2015 UTC,"It's installed on a Asus Zenfone 5. I would want to say that it's because of the Intel chip, but I've played PD before and it ran just fine. Currently it's running on Kitkat 4.4.4  My other suspicion is root. And I have a couple of xposed modules too. No custom ROM here."
PixelDungeon,2vb0ne,00-Evan,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"Hrm, that's a pretty unique situation, something PD is doing (either due to your intel, your xposed, or a combo of the two) is causing a kernel panic. As you have root, sending me your kernel panic logs might allow me to figure out the issue, but they are rarely as nice as a java stack trace so we'll have to see.  Here's a stack overflow thread about finding android system crash(kernel panic) logs, hopefully that's helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9682306/android-how-to-get-kernel-logs-after-kernel-panic  You can email me the logs at: Evan@ShatteredPixel.com"

I found this game thanks to the Reddit random button, so I figured I'd share it with all of you guys.  This game was also the first time I'd fought the Dwarf King, let alone Yog-Dzewa! And I'm so lucky that I won at all. I ran out of healing potions against Yog-Dzewa and was forced to use my potion of paralytic gas against him and his blazing fist, suffice it to say that I'm lucky I wedged myself in the corner next to Yog-Dzewa or I would have gotten taken out by the larva. I'm so glad that I thought to do this, I literally did not look up any suggestions or anything and...  ...  I just realized this, but I never did use the Rogue's Garb special ability...  I was probably able to do that a lot better than I did."

PixelDungeon,2v2ntj,causa-sui,2,Sat Feb 7 07:28:42 2015 UTC,Killed both fists and Yog-Dzewa in 4-5 hits each. Who needs vampiric when everything else dies in 1 hit? :D
PixelDungeon,2v2ntj,egotripping,2,Sat Feb 7 07:29:28 2015 UTC,Yeah. That's pretty good.  I think if you have something stunning +5 or more though you can't really lose.
PixelDungeon,2v2ntj,egotripping,2,Sat Feb 7 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on the weapon, doesn't it? I had a stunning knuckleduster that I balanced for speed (obviously) and yeah, lots of enemies would get stun-locked while I wailed away on them. (An unstable knuckleduster can be ridiculous too, hitting mobs with a variety of debuffs before they can swing back.) But on a glaive or warhammer you don't get as many hits, and so lucky and vampiric have got to be the best on them."
PixelDungeon,2v2ntj,dalesd,2,Sun Feb 8 11:08:44 2015 UTC,I've won with a stunning spear before. Stun is ridiculously op.
PixelDungeon,2v2ntj,MoronLessOff,2,Sun Feb 8 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"Put another way: on a high level glaive (and probably a warhammer), lucky is better than stunning because which is better - stunning the enemy, or killing it on the first hit every time?"

PixelDungeon,2v2ntj,NinjaDerpy,3,Sat Feb 7 16:50:00 2015 UTC,I has a chance to land an additional hit each attack.  I have a shot of my warrior's Lucky Glaive +7.  It's a great weapon.
PixelDungeon,2v2ntj,NinjaDerpy,2,Sat Feb 7 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"Basically it does a bunch of rolls (one per item level) and then assigns damage according to the best roll. That's not exactly right but it's the general idea. It's pretty bad with low-damage weapons like a knuckleduster, but with a high level glaive on a berserker you're regularly doing 60-70 damage per hit or more. I balanced it for accuracy because you don't need speed either when everything dies from one hit! The biggest hit I had on the run was 103."

PixelDungeon,2uy65o,musiczlife,9,Fri Feb 6 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"You're not describing easy mode anymore. You're describing cakewalk mode.  Also, 13-14 strength at the first floor is kind of a big deal. Assuming you're a warrior and find 3 upgrade scrolls on the first 4 floors (probably more because easy mode), you can carry plate armour+3 and a T3 weapon, or a T4+2 weapon and mail+1 by the time you fight Goo.   You can't quite do that in vanilla - best you can do is a scale+2 and T3+1 or mail and T4+3. Yes, there is a big difference. In an easy mode with 3 potions of strength, you deal and take a lot less damage than in vanilla.  And in your proposed ""cakewalk"" version, you pretty much just win every run because of absurdly high strength and upgrade values. This is not the point of the game. The point of the game is that you struggle and figure out how to play the game yourself, until you win. At least easy mode is hard enough so that you still have to figure out how to beat the game."
PixelDungeon,2uy65o,TheCanadianAlligator,-4,Fri Feb 6 04:25:47 2015 UTC,"(probably more because easy mode)    3 or more scrolls! :D no.  As what you've described, in that sense the game should be called normal mode if the original is 'hard mode'. Your yourself said ""easy mode is hard enough"" then there is no point to call it easy. I prefer cakewalking in easy mode. What we see in other games who has an easy mode specially old cassette games, they are really easy qualifying themselves."
PixelDungeon,2uy65o,Paradigmist,5,Fri Feb 6 05:16:27 2015 UTC,"The game is a roguelike.  If you think this is hard, play NetHack or one of the other more prototypical roguelikes; some people have played those games for decades and never won."
PixelDungeon,2uy65o,TheCanadianAlligator,2,Fri Feb 6 09:31:23 2015 UTC,"I said ""easy mode is hard enough,"" because you still have to actually have to learn to play the game. It is still very possible to win in easy mode. You're probably just running face-first into trouble and expecting to survive."
PixelDungeon,2uy65o,leozux,3,Fri Feb 6 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"LoL, I played one easy mode game and the gnoll shaman drop scrolls of upgrade, Dwarf Warlocks dropped potion of experience and strength, also the pixel market eventually spawns with SoU and PoS to sell, I finished the game in the first try 3 shotting the fists with a +16 longsword and 27 strength the difference is GIGANTIC, I still occasionally think about playing easy PD to see the big numbers. You probably have to get past Goo to actually feel the difference, but its big and its there."

PixelDungeon,2uy65o,causa-sui,3,Fri Feb 6 05:21:44 2015 UTC,"Amateur and crap player here, never finished the game but have beaten the goo many times.  Do you stand on water, with the goo on dry ground in front of you? He heals in water, and it washes acid off of you.  Do you use your sungrass or earthroot seed on yourself, and a sorrowmoss on the goo? If you get set up on the edge of water, right where an earthroot was, you're pretty much set.   Obvious points, but do you have adequate strength for your weapons and armour? Being slowed and inaccurate with a damage penalty make it that much harder.   Other than that, try and go down there as healthy as possible, and good luck. The rat king might help, but there's no guarantee you'll find him in time, and you may get into a worse situation by finding the goo before you've picked your battleground.  ((if anyone wants to do one of these for how to sort out the bs fire elementals in the demon halls, thst would be awesome :)))"
PixelDungeon,2uy65o,LostMyPasswordNewAcc,-6,Fri Feb 6 07:12:13 2015 UTC,I am poor at seeds. I've never used any of them except the sungrass to start fire. Moreover my victory depends on a good upgraded armour.

PixelDungeon,2uqvs7,follier,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was immensely eye-opening for me. Sniper is a lot more powerful if you can upgrade the boomerang and keep some distance between you and you enemies."

PixelDungeon,2uqvs7,causa-sui,7,Wed Feb 4 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"Omigosh story time. My sister and I were driving to the beach, and I was playing rogue. I got stuck between two warlocks and died really quickly. I got super pissed but my sister told me to calm down. I almost broke my phone but I didn't. I decided to try Huntress for the first time and beat the game on that first try. I got a ring of haste +3 and a ring of shadows +1 from the beginning, and then I got plate +4 from the ghost. I found a glaive +2 from a tombstone and after a few upgrade scrolls and strength potions I completely rolled through the game. And after that, I used a scroll of weapon upgrade on my glaive and got vampiric. I couldn't believe my eyes when I actually got the Amulet on my first try on huntress. That was before degradation and stuff, but it was possible."
PixelDungeon,2uqvs7,NinjaDerpy,19,Mon Feb 9 02:54:30 2015 UTC,"So pay attention, ItsSomethingLikeThat: all you have to do is roll a Ring of Haste +3 and a plate armor +4 from the friendly ghost. See? Easy peasy!"

I like all the seeds, and if you get a wand of regrowth, and the boots you are really set.  Current game I suspect I will win, got a Long Sword +3 from ghost, didn't find any armor till lvl 7, but now on lvl 8 with +6 sword, and +2 plate.  I win probably one game in 10, have to find something good on the first 2 lvls or you are screwed.  Just started playing with swarm intelligent monsters.  More likely to get over run by rats on lvl 1, but otherwise not too different."
PixelDungeon,2uqvs7,Monorail5,3,Thu Feb 5 06:52:54 2015 UTC,"I have been playing mostly huntress for the last six months (both shattered and vanilla) and I have found a nice strategy for completing the game with her. Since her health base is so low one must be very careful and play her very differently from the other classes. I only upgrade the boomerang as sniper and navigate the first 5 levels with care. Her passive ability to see monsters through doors is a great benefit to kill the monsters before they can reach you. One of many useful tricks is to open doors by throwing food to maximize distance between you and the monsters. There are also quite a few trickshots to hit enemies standing behind corners with the boomerang by aiming further behind them etc. I usually kill Goo by careful planting of seeds and usage of crowd control potions. If done correct he will never even hit you  before he is stone cold.   It is hard to explain every detail of ny strategy without actually showing it, but many things can be learned about the class and it thus makes the class the most fun to play imo."

PixelDungeon,2uqvs7,Infintinity,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"Easily my favorite class. One good thing to come out of the recent PD upgrades is that there are plenty of Scrolls of Enchantment to be found, and this makes the boomerang all the more fun. I like to upgrade it up to about +5 and then if you manage to enchant it with flaming, venomous, vampiric, shocking, unstable, etc. it's a riot using it to soften up the bad guys before they get near you. Obviously you'll have the best run if you can find ways to keep your distance from enemies using a ring of haste, slowness wand, blink wand, etc."
PixelDungeon,2uqvs7,divoire,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"you have to pray ur luck to get amour 1st since huntress health is really low, after that only start gaining weapon for damages. Just remember AMOUR for this class is 1st priority"

The strategy is as follows:   Defeat enemy Heal with dew vial Fill up dew vial Go deeper.   You get the most potions of experience from sungrass seeds, because they don't give any health potions after a while so you should have a 1/8 chance of getting a PoE (with alchimist's toolkit ~16 seeds of sungrass per level).

Just so you are aware, you are not being downvoted because you won a game on a fresh install. That is impressive and normally receives upvotes. You're getting downvotes because of your attitude about it - you're acting above everyone else, like your wins and accomplishments are worth more than somebody else's.  We do have a wonderful community here, but the community is not a place to brag about our wins. You could win your first twelve games, one with each subclass, all on a fresh install, and still be downvoted depending on your attitude about the situation. (""Woo! Reset my game a few days ago, and I finally got all twelve!"" vs. ""Told you haters I could do it. Won with twelve subclasses after resetting my phone, since I can win with any game with any class. Can any of you do that?"")  Understandably, bragging is fun. But that's what the Hall of Fame is for, so you can be recognized for your PD skill without needing to shove it in everyone's face.

Try use them when you feel you wanna upgrade your items OR got a cursed item(higher risk).  Try use them on ""many hidden secrets"" room to test some luck on getting Magic Mapping scroll.

PixelDungeon,2un7b1,vironlawck,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:50:24 2015 UTC,This is pretty much the strat I came up with too after hundreds of games. Good to see other ppl thinking the same.
PixelDungeon,2un7b1,callmeWia,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:52:48 2015 UTC,I also try potions and scrolls at the start of a floor. This way if I get a mind vision or a magic mapping it can be really useful.
PixelDungeon,2un7b1,PlaySalieri,1 point,Wed Feb 4 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"The downside of this strategy is that when items/floors are generated, they seem to take your strength into account. So it's better to enter a level after drinking a strength potion. And if it's a mind vision, it lasts long enough to use it at the end of one floor (to check for forgotten hidden rooms) and at the beginning of the following."
PixelDungeon,2un7b1,TrillTrill,2,Sun Feb 8 08:11:30 2015 UTC,"Only id or drink pots at the end of a floor because you may find you need that liquid flame, levitation, or invis. Plus str is used when generating items on a floor (forget where I heard this but whatever) so in case you do have a str that is unided, its consistent to wait until before you begin a new floor.  Scrolls, wait until youve started the new floor in case you get magic mapping.  Cursed items are a crapshoot so I stick to only equip iding items that are from pirhana rooms or   guarded tombs as they are curse free and simply unided.  My exception is random tier 4 or 5 gear unless I already have said gear. Ill always try to equip id it because usually ill have a remove curse scroll by the time that stuff shows up. If I have a scale and axe or longsword tho ill just vendor them if I have to take a risk... rather not be stuck with junk."

I've figured out how to off yog without even taking damage, so I don't worry about liberal use of them starting in the dwarven halls."

PixelDungeon,2ukyym,00-Evan,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of a subclass specific effect tied to an item like the armor kit, I'm not sure if the existing class armor is the best fit but it's an idea I've toyed with. My biggest issue with the armor kit is that health isn't the best resource fit for this sort of endgame item IMO, my prference would be to make a very powerful effect, and tie that to a large cooldown and give it a very restrictive maximum number of uses. Would force interesting decision making.  I'll give my thoughts on each of the mechanics.  Warrior: Making engaging many enemies at once a good choice situationally fits thematically with the warrior and could offer interesting game-play.  Gladiator: I'm not entirely sure what you mean here, but i'm not using if potion synergy is the best fit for the warrior, he's very much a weapons 'n armor kind of character.  Berserker: I pretty much agree with any mechanic that lets the berserker actually benefit from being low on life. Currently the berserker's desire to be hurt is really difficult to work with as it makes you far too easy to kill. My preference would be toward giving him some tool that lets him get low on health without risking death.  Mage: Neat thematically, but I'm not sure giving the mage a tanking tool is a good fit for him. I do like the kiting potential though, which is more appropriate for a ranged attacker.  Warlock: Manipulating life definitely fits the warlock, though I'd see a more 'greedy' effect as appropriate. Perhaps rather than having the warlock hurt himself, have the effect grow stronger the weaker he is, and allow him to regen health from the ensuing battle.  BattleMage: A nice simple effect, seems to fit well, perhaps let the battlemage gain some wand charge for each target he hits?  Rogue: Fits well thematically, but i'm not sure there's much the rogue can do to play around the ability. Additionally, a pure tanking tool is more the warrior's thing.  FreeRunner: Implementing this would be incredibly difficult from a coding perspective, but it's a really fun idea.  Assassin: I like the concept but thematically the assassin should perhaps be more about single target elimiation.  Huntress: Good thematic fit and an excellent kiting tool, would work well.  Sniper: Similarly to the Assassin, I think single target works best for this class.  Warden: I like it, the game could use more minions too.    I'll share a couple ideas I've had for subclass abilites. Remember I'm working on the concept that there would be extremely limited uses of these, so the abilities are appropriately powerful.  Berserker: Great Fury: for a couple turns all damage the berserker would take instead stacks a special buff, which significantly increases his damage and decays away over time after the immunity has ended.  Warlock: Siphon Soul: The warlock takes a weakened enemy and begins draining their soul. This takes many turns and is cancelled if the warlock is interrupted. The enemy is suppressed but takes no actual damage, and may be able to break the spell if they are healthy enough. After some time the spell completes, the enemy dies, and the warlock fully heals and fully satisfies hunger.  Assassin: Death mark: strike an enemy dealing 0 damage, but applying a debuff which, after several turns, instantly kills that enemy from any HP. Bosses would resist this obviously.  Sniper: True Shot: the sniper gains mind vision of all enemies on the level, and is able to perform a single ranged attack through any obstacle at any range, which deals tremendous damage, scaling on distance from the sniper.    P.S. sorry for the delay in getting back to you on the facebook fan page Roasted messaged me about. I actually don't have access to my facebook account atm and wanted to see if I could get that back before I talked with you about it."

PixelDungeon,2ukyym,gohjohn,1 point,Wed Feb 4 10:07:40 2015 UTC,"I really wish reddit had some kind of proper todo or inbox functionality, I read your post then promptly forgot for a few days, sorry about that =S.  I'll comment on what's new:  OMNISLASH: It's a really neat concept, I've actually considered something similar. I'm not sure nimbly darting around fits the warrior thematically though, would work better on the rogue.  DISCHARGE: looks interesting and effective, perhaps more of a berserker style attack though.  STOMP: good AOE ability, the stun would have a nice synergy with comboing too. Perhaps have the effect not interrupt a combo to enable more tactical possibilities.  BACKTRACK: just to comment on the technicalities, basically the game has to keep a whole bunch of stuff in memory in order to know stuff like 'there is an enemy here', or 'you have 5 health potions', but unlike a human brain it's really literal about what it stores, so if the hero moves a tile to the right the game completely forgets where he was before, unless I specifically tell it to record that info and where to record it. As you can imagine, with all the enemies, items, buffs and the hero, keeping a history of the last 5-10 moves would not only take up a lot of memory but would be a huge programming task. Something smaller scale, like only remembering where the hero was (and say their HP) would be much more feasible.  VOID: sounds similar to the timekeeper's hourglass or the new freerunner passive with the cloak of shadows. Anything involving manipulating time is fun.  REFLECT: sound very similar to the cape of thorns, also generally shouldn't encourage the huntress to stay near an enemy.  SPIKE: fits the huntress very well thematically, and it helps her kite"

PixelDungeon,2ud45s,jcpb,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"Shadow bolts are magic attacks - they ignore your armor and all the upgrades applied to it.

Your best bet is to fight them at a corner or door and force them to chase you, so they have no choice but to engage at melee range - and they hit for practically nothing. This tactic also works for both the Gnoll Trickster in sewers and Scorpions in demon halls.  Now, if you think shadow bolts are bad, wait until you see those Evil Eyes in demon halls. The moment you have more than one Eye on you, you might as well restart."
PixelDungeon,2ud45s,jcpb,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:34:38 2015 UTC,That's what I meant by kiting them.  Taking the ranged mobs to corners is my general strategy.

They aren't as common as evil eyes in the demon halls, and are easily defeated at melee range. Just retreat behind a corner the moment you see one to make them come to you. Use potions of invis/wands of blink/teleport if necessary.  Once you get to the demon halls, You'll be facing evil eyes, which pretty much destroy everything, ever, and scorpions, which will always kite out of melee range. Combine those two ranged enemies with the darkenss, and you've still got quite a battle ahead of you.  I wish you luck!"

Make the blacksmith available on every four or five levels likk the shopkeeper and make it allowed to use the blacksmith again and again on the same weapon you have so you can upgrade it several times. Even if the blacksmith makes u do a mission for each upgrade job he does.
PixelDungeon,2uadb1,hyde16341634,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:19:58 2015 UTC,I do agree that the blacksmith is somewhat underrated. I think he should be able to combine items so you could upgrade them without losing glyphs or enchantments.

PixelDungeon,2u9u4d,harnov,7,Sat Jan 31 03:56:09 2015 UTC,"In a game like PD where a change of depth is important, this trap will very likely kill the run. Things to consider:   You take a ton of damage when falling Some paths may become impassible due to a trap in the way (Need to search for hidden alternative route) If you fall down again (and again) on the way up, you might be lost and underleveled, which likely means you die.   If any developers are thinking of still implementing this, I suggest checking out how it is done in ""Moraff's Dungeons of the Unforgiven"" (a game I played in the past). They have multiple up and down ladders and huge rooms to avoid traps.  Currently I doubt PD and its mods can support this type of trap. Even if it could, it reduces the enjoyability of the game severely."

PixelDungeon,2u7gu0,MoronLessOff,6,Fri Jan 30 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"The wand of poison is an interesting one.  I'm currently looking into ways to tweak it for the wand rework, and I agree with /u/davidsverse that its best role isn't as a primary damage source. That being said, it definitely needs some general buffing and incentive to level it up."
PixelDungeon,2u7gu0,00-Evan,2,Fri Jan 30 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"I am sure you have at least thought of these ideas for the wand of poison but just my two cents:) 1) Make the poison damage percentage-based so it stays relevant. 2) Poison can represent weakening the monster, so let the wand amplify the damage done to the monster.  Increased leveling of the wand in the first scenario would result in greater percentage damage per tick and in the 2nd scenario, longer duration of amplified damage."
PixelDungeon,2u7gu0,OoStellarnightoO,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:59:13 2015 UTC,"The wand could do more damage, but it should only be a little more at most. I really like the idea of a viable combat item who's thing isn't directly dealing or reducing damage, currently we have exactly 0 of those."
PixelDungeon,2u7gu0,00-Evan,2,Mon Feb 2 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"I got a very similar run as a battle mage, +3 plate on depth 2, horn of plenty and a chalice, but no battle wand other than poison, I just killed DM-300 and decided to suicide, I was starting to waste too many pots since there was no real way to kill enemies.   I wish one day wands get a rework so all wands scale better or add more wands so the battle mage class can be a little less rng dependent, because right now, doesn't matter the run u're having with a normal melee class, skeleton will easily drop something useful for you, since there is like 6 weapons that are very viable to upgrade and finish the game, while a battle mage has really no way of getting his wands other than luck and just have 2, maybe 3 good wands to end the game."
PixelDungeon,2u7gu0,leozux,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:41:31 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree.  The wand is great.  However like with a lot of items it's great as a secondary source of damage.  It also works best with the Rogue class.  I have won the game with an Assassin Rogue and a +6 Wand of poison.    Also the wand has almost no backfire issues.  Unless you aim at a wall its not going to bite you like the wand of lightning and especially the fire wand can.    Though I can see how it could be a major issue as a Battle Mage.  So if there is any damage scaling, it should be Battle Mage specific."
PixelDungeon,2u7gu0,davidsverse,3,Fri Jan 30 16:41:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think any other class would normally dump scrolls into it though.  Even as a rouge, armor is priority for the dodge bonus, then weapon like every other class. It would seem that adding 1 or 2 more points of damage per tick would be very beneficial.  I would even trade the duration of the poison for higher damage.  I don't know the exact numbers, but lust just pretend that at higher levels a Wand of Poison does 50 damage total.  That damage being done over 3 turns would be much more beneficial than over 10 turns.  In the Demon Halls, when you have to fight you need to end the fights fast.  Since the poison only refreshes on cast, I'm almost certain I'll be screwed."
PixelDungeon,2u7gu0,jcpb,1 point,Fri Jan 30 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"Drink a Potion of Purification and plant a Earthroot before you start meleeing DM-300. If the potion wears off, drink another; if the armor buff wears off, hit the boss with a curare dart so you can run off, plant another Earthroot and repeat.  Alternatively, if there is a Well of Transmutation, use it to turn that Poison wand into something else.  Poison is great as a counter against a mob's innate HP regeneration, and super for hit-and-run tactics. It's not good when you're playing a mage and it's your only battle wand that deals damage. If I were you I'd just start over."

I don't think I'll give up, I'll see how far I can push it.  I can kite the Monks and Golems fairly easily with my other utility wands.  I'll probably make Eyes and Succubi fight each other as I speed through the halls.  My Ring of Haste +3 I just got from the Ambitious Imp should help with that.  And I'm an idiot.  I always use Earthroot on DM-300, but I never thought to drink the Purification potion.  Thanks for the tip."

And it's even better than mine was. Not quite sure how big the difference is, but it's awesome anyway. Really awesome, paired with some distance-creating wand like Slowness or Blink - or Regrowth :D. But in terms of damage it's not as awesome as the grim one I got. Once upon a time. Yeah, it's probably something close to a once-in-a-lifetime experience. That counts for both enchantments. They are so raaaaare... But anyway, vampiric is way more powerful because of the fact that you might be able to survive indefinitely with it. At least you should be able to win more easily.  SO: Congratulations to OP for getting this awesome enchantment, and the boomerang to +7. You beat my ""high score"" in PD's minigame of LUCK."

PixelDungeon,2u2qd5,trulte42,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:52:49 2015 UTC,Better on a melee character? Sniper makes the boomerang way more usable. It would have been much less ideal on a melee char. But that's my opinion and point-of-view. So IMO then.

The enemies/monsters were still hitting me every second attack. was so gay. I had a +18 ring of evasion and the monsters were still hitting me every attaxk. Sure they would miss but basically rings dont work. The mechanics of pixel dungeon is fucked up. If u have a +18 ring of evasion thats upgraded the hell out of it, they shouls never hit you at all. Think about it. a +18 evasion ring? c'mon. Rings dont work at all.  p.s. i tried the same thing with ring of might. same deal. A +18 ring of might doesnt really do much.

PixelDungeon,2u0pgo,DriveGenie,2,Wed Jan 28 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, upgrading weapons is more important than upgrading armor, though the eldritch enchantment on the warhammer is pretty useful, especially with a ranged character. TBH, +6 plate is enough to get you through the rest of the game, so long as you manage your HP wisely.  Talisman of foresight isn't the most useful thing in the world. It upgrades relatively quickly though, so you might want to use it on a well of transmutation to try for a more powerful artifact such as the chalice. The next few floors are the hardest in the game. I recommend you grind levels for awhile on floor 19 before moving on. Dwarf king isn't too hard. Just stand on one of his pedestals, and he won't be able to summon as many undead dwarves.  After that, use magic mapping on EVERY floor. Otherwise you'll be stumbling around in the dark while being ripped to shreds by the lazer-light show. I wish you luck my friend!"

PixelDungeon,2txgia,JoshuMertens,2,Thu Jan 29 18:51:01 2015 UTC,Yes! Im not asking any questions but ill be supporting and will be playtesting if its allowed
PixelDungeon,2txgia,TheExpandingMind,2,Wed Jan 28 09:53:28 2015 UTC,Of course it's allowed; it's what I asked for :) Thank you!
PixelDungeon,2txedw,pokeaim,6,Wed Jan 28 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. There doesn't seem to be a point to weighting for speed or using fast weapons anymore, and rings got a HUGE unnecessary nerf because their effects are passive and you'll probably have them degrade without you even knowing."
PixelDungeon,2txedw,TheCanadianAlligator,2,Wed Jan 28 04:35:35 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, first try? awesome job!!   (Also, don't waste your scrolls on armour unless you have plenty.)"
PixelDungeon,2txedw,gohjohn,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:54:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Yeah, I tried to, sadly 3 scrolls of enchantment are all I could find. So, 1 for weapon while 2 for armor and those are the rolls."
PixelDungeon,2txshx,Flameshadow22,5,Wed Jan 28 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"So yeah I pretty much agree with this entirely.  To be clear, the ranged item/invis synergy was far too powerful, I really think it shows how badly the huntress needs help that this strategy was one of the only ways to be very effective with her.  I have been trying to bring in more kiting tools through various updates, things like blindweed, earthfruit, stormvine, thrown potions of levitiation, ring of haste, etc. all help the huntress out some. Despite that, I agree the huntress needs some buffs.  Traditionally I handle that sort of thing through a rework, similar to how the rogue is now no longer a weaker warrior due to his interaction with the cloak, I would want to do something similar with the huntress.  I don't have a rework planned out for the huntress atm, but the situation is so bad I might give her numbers a little boost next update, just as a tide-over until the rework comes."
PixelDungeon,2txshx,00-Evan,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:41:42 2015 UTC,Just buff her accuracy. I don't like how she basicly have to have a ring of sharpshooting to make her worthwhile. And even then it's a struggle coz now you are you using valuable scrolls that you could have used on the boomerang. However that would prob cause the ring of sharpshooting to become redundant.
PixelDungeon,2txshx,VlermuisVermeulen,2,Wed Jan 28 21:25:52 2015 UTC,"The huntress doesn't actually have poor accuracy, all ranged items suffer a big accuracy cut if they're used a point-blank range.  This, of course, is something I could change to buff her, i'll consider it along with other things."
PixelDungeon,2txshx,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Jan 29 04:13:15 2015 UTC,Perhaps start the huntress with a +1 ring of haste. Makes sense for a hunter to be quick and this will allow you to make some distance if things get hairy.
PixelDungeon,2txshx,jyjjy,1 point,Sun Feb 1 12:08:24 2015 UTC,Also putting her starting health up to normal would be welcomed. Making the girl weaker was always pretty sexist and making the start of the game harder for her than the other classes just a bitch.  Edit: Another idea is just make the boomerang act as melee weapon when used point blank without equipping it as such. Kinda silly to require you to waste the time it takes to equip it simply to hit something with it rather than throw it. Alternately let throwing the boomerang work properly when equipped as melee.
PixelDungeon,2txshx,jyjjy,5,Sun Feb 1 12:38:13 2015 UTC,"Having to commit scrolls to a tier 5 weapon after using the boomerang for most of the game AND actually doing ok feels so cheap...  Also gimps huntress for the rest of the run, coz then you are a reeeealy sub par warrior with a +3 instead of a +7 weapon.  Sadly,  after a certain point, boomerang just doesn't do enough damage, unless you roll a god tier enchant like stun on the weapon scroll.  Even with that, Yog takes too many hits to die and you can't kite the fists for long enough. I died to them after using 10 HP pots with boomerang sniper. Melee boomerang accuracy is ludicrous so I desperately had to fight with a +2 glaive. Once they get to you (and they will) its gg. No amount of blink wands and new invis pots can save you from both fists.  I suggest better scaling on later levels of boomerang upgrades. Or better accuracy. Or allowing accuracy upgrade on a 2nd whetstone on boomerang. Or giving sniper a +0 accuracy ring so she can proc her passive reliably even at the cost of scrolls. Or an artifact to give her some way to kite such as temporary haste. Other classes manage to get their late game assured by a single item. A good weapon on assassin, a good wand on mage. Warrior is more flexible and resilient to RNG but that's his thing.  Sniper is on the other hand FAR too RNG dependent on getting good supporting gear to help her kite. More than one wand preferentially. And ring of haste too.  To get her power level on more even footing she needs some kind of enabler for her playstile not to be punishing or clunky, very much like assassin got. He still loooves doors. But doesn't entirely depend on them. Sniper loooves long corridors. And she needs them. Or she dies. Way too fast. And has no way to turn a fight around nor gtfo coz boomerang does 0 DMG on melee range."
PixelDungeon,2txshx,jyjjy,1 point,Wed Jan 28 07:30:28 2015 UTC,I've had no problems with Yog/huntress. Just kill the fists first.
PixelDungeon,2txshx,gohjohn,2,Sun Feb 1 12:05:50 2015 UTC,"I agree! The invisibility nerf forces huntress to be a MUCH weaker warrior (Huntress is weaker at melee than all other classes ceteris paribus).  It forces you to dedicate scrolls into more defense and a tier5 weapon, to fight Yog like a warrior. (This was my previous playstyle, but the invisible potions were still required)  Please buff her Evan, even the results of the poll shows that huntress is currently the least favourite class."
PixelDungeon,2txshx,jyjjy,1 point,Wed Jan 28 07:00:30 2015 UTC,"What exactly is your issue fighting Yog with huntress now? The flame fist is the only part that I've had any issues with and even just straight up trading ranged blows with it only costs 3, maybe 4 health potions. Beyond that the fight isn't hard if you have some invisiblity potions to make distance and mind vision to let you wack em from the other end of the map.  Honestly I don't have much of an issue with the invisibility nerf in general. The bosses were pointless previously and I don't find them particularly hard now with some creative thinking. Don't think I've ever died vs a boss with huntress other than goo honestly and I use her a lot."
PixelDungeon,2txshx,imhoopjones,1 point,Sun Feb 1 12:21:29 2015 UTC,I really hate her starting chances in the sewer. Absolutely unfair that a crab can reduce her to no health with no recourse. I have beaten goo once out of 20 games..and it's not fun to bother when there are no guaranteed health pots and her starting equipment sucks.

PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,00-Evan,11,Mon Jan 26 18:56:29 2015 UTC,I would love to have some insight on the Warrior rework.
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,EternalSnorlax,9,Mon Jan 26 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"It's not something I've pegged down very much, especially as the mage is getting his rework first with 0.3.0. All I really know is that I want all the heroes to start at 10 strength, and that I want the warrior to be the easiest to play as a noob, but not strictly as strong early on as he is currently.  regardless, there will be time to discuss that later, the main point here is the balance changes."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,Britsman,8,Mon Jan 26 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could make the ""identify through using x times"" process faster for weapons/armor on the warrior (makes sense that he would be an equipments expert). Another option would be to make it harder for monks to disarm the warrior (weapon expertise). Otherwise, some kind of parry/riposte mechanic based on current str/-weapon str would be interesting (similar to a weaker ring of thorns buff)."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,jbstjohn,2,Mon Jan 26 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"How about getting weapon proficiency? The more you use a weapon, the better you get with it? That would also prompt interesting decisions about when to switch gear."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,v3xx,10,Tue Jan 27 08:05:24 2015 UTC,My biggest problem is cursed items. Usually it's just not worth wasting a scroll of identify on an item unless it's a very high tier. Also equipping a lower tier item to try to identify it that way isn't usually worth it since you risk getting stuck with a cursed item. You are punished too severely when equipping anything cursed and nobody wants to risk losing the game because of it.
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,v3xx,3,Mon Jan 26 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I know it's a traditional roguelike staple but curses are very boring from a gameplay perspective. I agree they would become more pronounced if the player is given more gear around their level and less high tier stuff. Solutions could range from tweaks to identify/remove curse scroll drops to adjusting curse probabilities, to reworking curses so they there's more counterplay instead of just not equipping things."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,PlaySalieri,7,Mon Jan 26 21:01:23 2015 UTC,My vote is for items to lose their curse after some amount of time and when the curse lifts the item is reset to 0.
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,nasdarovye,3,Mon Jan 26 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you can make curses more of a choice. Maybe curses could be powerful enchants with big draw backs too. Maybe a weapon hits harder, but also hurts you or some armor gives you extra speed, but attracts monsters. If enchants/curses were hidden until identification and you removed the ""painful grip"" curses could become more of a choice risk/reward than just a boring mechanic."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,DogOfSevenless,4,Tue Jan 27 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"This is something i'm consider, but remember that curses are something that has to be played around. Curses would still be mandatory."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,kawarazu,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe an NPC in the post tengu levels that offered a faustian bargain after completing a quest, like the blacksmith. Bring him a cursed item and he will ""fix"" it for you with a cost, like outlined above."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,thinbuddha,2,Tue Jan 27 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"What about something like sacrificing blood (hp) to remove one level of the curse at a time. It would have to be more than half your full hp each time (75%?). A level -2 cursed item would require three blood sacrifices, so you wouldnt be able to remove it immediately without using two health potions or other healing methods.  EDIT: just had another thought. Maybe add some other small ways to get rid of cursed items: if a thief tries to steal from you it will always steal your cursed item out of your hands (the logic here could be that the dark magic prefers the nimble hands of the thief or something).  EDIT2: the biggest curses I've commonly seen at -2. Maybe reward the player for persisting with a cursed item by having something that conjugates the level on the weapon. -2 cursed weapon becomes +2. This doesn't seem too over powered or unbalanced does it? Maybe if you kill a boss with a cursed item it drops a ""magic mirror"" or something like that."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,jbstjohn,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:12:56 2015 UTC,Provide more counter play options. I advise the nethack route with blessed potions and prayer.
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,watakushi,3,Mon Jan 26 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"It's honestly pretty hard to imagine how this will affect the game play. I mean I get that it's pushing a player in the direction of using lower level items until later in the game, and perhaps forcing the use of upgrades on lower or mid tier items. In theory it could work, but it is practically reinventing the game, and will take considerable tweaking to perfect, and a lot of time as a player to adopt new strategy.   So.. Personally, I'm open to it, but I'm not a big believer that it is simpler than degradation. I just don't know what to expect."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,Upside-DownFish,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a big change just like degredation was, and simplicity isn't the goal necessarily. I agree with Watabou that the 'shove all my upgrades into one item' strategy sucks and I don't think there's a solution to it that doesn't mix up the gameplay a fair bit.  The point, I hope, is that there is an effective way to accomplish the balance change while ensuring that said gameplay mixup is as friendly to the players as possible.  edit: also, a lot of the unknown can be dealt with through some testing. I will definitely want to distribute some builds with these balance changes for testing before a full release."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,davidsverse,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"I think it sounds interesting and promising. That said, I almost always have choices as to what to upgrade, between weapon, armour and wands / rings.  I like the incidental benefit of making the final levels more with exploring too"
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,davidsverse,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe the 'shove all my upgrades into one item' strategy could be solved by, say, limiting the amount of upgrades you can apply to a an item depending on your character level. e.g. You're only allowed to upgrade any item once every 2/3 levels. This would prevent abuse of upgrade scrolls, and encourage using them on different items, or keeping them and working on leveling up. ...but maybe str reqs. will have to be lowered a bit."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,PlaySalieri,3,Fri Jan 30 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly these ideas sound great. A much more elegant solution to item degradation, and seems to have a lot of thought put into it."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,psychicmario,2,Mon Jan 26 23:14:53 2015 UTC,"As long as there is a balance between the game being fun and challenging enough to keep regular players playing, without making it so hard that new players just don't play."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,gohjohn,2,Mon Jan 26 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"How about levels of UG scrolls?  Kinda like with the dew.  UG Scrolls start giving +1, by end game they give + 3.  Same with str potions."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,jbstjohn,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:58:01 2015 UTC,I do like that you've thought of the root problems of upgrade stacking and how to address it rather than simply trying to prevent people from doing the strategy. Thank you.
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,groverXIII,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:10:36 2015 UTC,May I know why degradation is such a big problem that it cannot be implemented in shattered?I personally treated it like minecraft but I may be missing something
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,groverXIII,2,Tue Jan 27 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"The punishment for breaking an item in most Minecraft games is very little. 3 iron and 2 sticks and done. Even if you accidentally break your enchanted diamond boots accidentally, you won't die, and most certainly won't lose the game.  The issue here is that degradation severely punishes a player for not checking his equipment, to the tune of 1 upgrade scroll, which are limited in quantity. (This is because if you upgrade an equipment, the durability is reset)  The resultant effect is an additional difficulty placed on the player, to constantly check his equipment and manage his repair tools. This additional difficulty makes the game less enjoyable overall."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,jbstjohn,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:40:45 2015 UTC,It's also not remotely a fun thing to have to check on / monitor.
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,zombie-rat,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"I like the thought process here. It's probably going to take some testing and tweaking to find a solution that works, but this is a much better way of going about it, compared to just implementing a major, game-changing mechanic.  Personally, one of my favorite parts of the game is finding and building up that one great weapon. Degradation obviously takes that away altogether. What you're proposing makes that a bit more difficult to achieve, but it's still doable.  What I would like to see, I think, is just a bit more variety in weapons. Right now you just have weapons that vary in speed/damage and occasionally have enchantments. I think it would be nice to see some more in-depth variety in weapons, maybe in the being of what the Diablo games do: damage enhancements, a wider variety of enchantments, that sort of thing. Give people a reason to become attached to a piece of gear."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,LostMyPasswordNewAcc,3,Tue Jan 27 03:35:44 2015 UTC,"A greater variety is something I also want to target with the weapon/armor rework, but I wanted this topic to be specifically about the strength balance changes, not my plans for that update."

PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,gillecave500,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:51:31 2015 UTC,Here I think some simple specialisation could help a lot.
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,dustysquareback,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but personally I don't think these ideas should be implemented. Instead of having an obvious degradation bar, this would subtly make the game harder, decreasing the sense of achievement for newcomers, while not giving any hints as to how to play better: eg. using tactics for upgrading ."
PixelDungeon,2tqxzr,noobtablet9,2,Tue Jan 27 18:02:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you see this as subtle. It's certainly not as aggressive or prominent as degradation but it will still be perfectly clear how much strength an item requires. All this really does is adjust at what point in the game higher tier equipment becomes usable, so players have to rely on low/mid tier items for longer. A simply sign in the prison saying something like 'Choose your upgrades wisely, balance between surviving right now and waiting to invest in powerful heavy gear' might help drive the point home."

Such trolling  Now if only sniper got a unique artifact. Or a better scaling boomerang. Or a mini cloak of shadows. I miss her so..."
PixelDungeon,2tnx6h,JoshTriplett,5,Sun Jan 25 23:36:57 2015 UTC,"I'd already won the game as a Battlemage (with a +12 wand of Firebolt), so I gave Warlock a shot.  I found a Ring of Wealth +1 early on in a chest, and kept it on almost all the time.  That made a major difference in the number of items I found, including a Wand of Regrowth, and several artifacts.  Together with the new discovery that a Well of Change changes an artifact and keeps its upgrade level, I ended up with many powerful upgraded artifacts.  My first artifact was the Talisman of Foresight; I put it on and let it upgrade itself as I explored.  When I found a Well of Change, I realized that I'd never actually tried changing an artifact, so I gave it a shot, and ended up with a partially-upgraded Horn of Plenty; a few rations and one store worth of overpriced rations later, and it was +10.  No more food worries for the rest of the game.  I found the Timekeeper's Hourglass next, and upgraded it with some bags of sand.  Another Well of Change turned that into the much more useful Chalice of Blood, already upgraded to +5 or so, saving me several risky feedings.  I had very little armor at this point, but with the help of Earthroot and a couple of blessed Ankhs, I got it to +9; I waited to get it to +10 until I bought and blessed the Ankh from the Imp's shop for safety, but I ended up successfully upgrading it to +10 without dying.  DM-300 dropped the Cape of Thorns; since I had the Horn of Plenty and the Chalice of Blood, I could already survive indefinitely, so I let that upgrade itself to +5 from damage.  When I found another Well of Change, I turned it into the Unstable Spellbook.  Four scrolls later (mirror image, lullaby, identify, and rage, all of which I had on hand), it was +9; sadly I didn't have a scroll of Psionic Blast to get it to +10.  Used it to map out several levels.  The Ambitious Imp provided a ring of Might +3, on which I spent the last two scrolls of Upgrade I found.  That ring (as a +3), together with Earthroot, helped me get the Chalice to +10 safely.  Finally, in the Demon Halls, I found the Sandals of Nature.  Since I had the Wand of Regrowth, I went ahead and farmed enough seeds to fully upgrade them to Greaves.  I did very little farming with the Wand of Regrowth; I only did so twice, once for enough dewdrops to refill the vial a couple of times (used to safely dive into the Demon Halls without burning piles of healing potions), and once for the Sandals of Nature.  By the time I got the last seed I needed, I'd found nine seeds of blandfruit, all of which I cooked into Sunfruit, and none of which I ended up eating.  The Imp's shop had a Potion of Experience for sale.  On a lark, on my way down to Yog-Dzewa, I tossed my remaining seeds (other than Earthroot and Sungrass) into an alchemy pot, and the second potion I got was Experience.  So, I entered Yog-Dzewa's lair at level 28, with strength 24, max health 185, the +10 Chalice, and the +9 knuckleduster.  Using invisibility, mind vision, and earthroot.  I quickly took out the rotting fist, which was down to about 25% health by the time the flaming fist found me; I used the dew vial to heal partway through the flaming fist, and never ended up using any healing potions in the battle.  The chalice brought me back to 100% before taking out Yog itself one slug at a time.  I think I just used up all the luck from my next hundred games.  Guess I ought to go earn all the YASD badges now."
PixelDungeon,2tnx6h,harnov,2,Mon Jan 26 00:12:39 2015 UTC,What does the spellbook give at +9 level? Does it give upgrade scrolls?
PixelDungeon,2tnx6h,ItsSomethingLikeThat,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"The spellbook never gives Upgrade or Weapon Upgrade, but it can give any other scroll. In this game I only used it for Magic Mapping, but Identify and Remove Curse can also come in handy."
PixelDungeon,2tnx6h,xhoi,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"A few questions:  1) I didn't know the imp had a shop, I've only found the guy that gives you a cursed ring. Where's his shop??  2) What does the fully upgraded Chalice actually do? I've never lived long enough to get it past +5 or +6.  3) Probably ties into question 2, but what do you mean when you say the Chalice took out Yog?  As a side note, I'm super jealous, that seems like a really fun playthrough."
PixelDungeon,2tnx6h,ItsSomethingLikeThat,2,Mon Jan 26 11:09:03 2015 UTC,"1) You have to complete the imp's quest before killing the dwarf King.  2) The Chalice increases your healing rate, as long as you're not starving. At +10, you regain 2 health per turn.  3) The Chalice just healed me heavily during the Yog battle."
PixelDungeon,2tnx6h,JoshuMertens,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"You can only get to the imp shop if you complete his quest(kill 6-8 of whatever he asks you too).

Try to avoid combat in the later levels as much as possible, your mind vis will help- the damage they do is not worth it, especially the eyes.

It has a glaive, which I also don't think is normal for an earlygame shop.  The real kicker is the screwy health potion colors. As you can see, I had a turquoise health potion, but the shops were selling azure health potions. When I bought one though, it changed into a turquoise potion.  To top it all off the seed bag isn't there either."
PixelDungeon,2tjahk,00-Evan,7,Sat Jan 24 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Huh, that is super weird, and should not be happening. It looks like your floor 6 shop is filling itself with items that are meant for the floor 21 shop. Given the different health potion colors I'm betting that the items were generated in a previous run, and somehow got used here. I'll investigate this and include a fix in the next patch, it's probably got to do with my rework to shop logic that allows for much larger shops."
PixelDungeon,2tjahk,Always_A_Gen_Behind,0,Sat Jan 24 20:02:36 2015 UTC,I am finding torches in the rooms you fall down into with empty well and a skeleton. l just use them for the fun of it.

PixelDungeon,2tjahk,DogOfSevenless,2,Sat Jan 24 23:46:02 2015 UTC,Night time now makes the game darker I think. So torches can be useful in floors earlier than demon halls. Makes me wonder why an underground dungeon even has a night time.

PixelDungeon,2tlbgq,thinbuddha,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"Food? For me, night mode saves food. You don't have to wander around looking for mobs to kill just so you can level up because they come to you.   But yeah, sometimes it backfires and you end up on death's door on the 3rd level."
PixelDungeon,2tlbgq,Flameshadow22,2,Mon Jan 26 00:17:44 2015 UTC,"I actually liked the option of playing night mode. I voluntarily set the clock to get it when playing warlock for a huge overlevelling in the first floors.  Actually saw it as a buff to him for the mad sustain and minimal health decrease after leveling a bit. Made goo a bit easier overall. Full healing from neverending fly mobs is also hilarious.  But later on resulted in monk mobs for much trolling. Good luck with that without wands, knuckleduster build or tp scrolls. Also made backtracking ridiculously taxing, so it's for the best I guess  I feel the dark level spawn rates in the current build could use a little tweaking tho. So many monks... Can't move on..."

PixelDungeon,2thyvv,MikeTheNike,1 point,Sat Jan 24 11:11:04 2015 UTC,I think the recipes are always random and you have to figure it out by yourself every game.   Does anyone know if the outcome will be always the same if I use same seeds over and over? Or is the outcome at random always?
PixelDungeon,2thyvv,gohjohn,7,Sat Jan 24 11:18:10 2015 UTC,"No, the recipes are fixed. Each potion has a corresponding seed and vice versa (except experience).  The standard potion costs 3 seeds. Each of the seeds represent 25% chance that the potion will be made.. Eg 3 seeds of firebloom gives above 75% chance of getting potion of liquid flame.  The last 25% chance is a chance for a random potion. This is the chance where the potion of experience can be brewed."
PixelDungeon,2thyvv,BetaMax789,3,Sat Jan 24 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this. By using 3 seeds of Sungrass (might not be the right name, the green seed) you can brew healing potions. Three seeds of ang kind with produce the potion corresponding with its effect. But when you use 2 seeds and a different type of seed, I don't know if you will always brew the potion with the effect of the 2 seeds you put in."
PixelDungeon,2thyvv,bloodyninja1122,1 point,Sat Jan 24 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"i would never use sungrass to brew, they are like non-instant healthpots  and i would rather have 3 non-instant healthpots vs 75% of 1 instnat healthpot"

PixelDungeon,2tjdhw,leozux,3,Sat Jan 24 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can stack weightstones on a weapon.  Anyways, it's up to you and your playstyle on how to use weightstones.  Generally for Gladiators, though, you adjust for speed rather than damage. I made a short list using knuckledusters for this. It shows how many turns you need to hit a target to do a total of 10 times of its damage for one hit.  This phrasing confuses me too, so I'll explain what I mean. For now, let's ignore gladiator. A knuckleduster hits 2 times per turn, so it does a total of 2x of its damage in one turn. So in 5 turns, it will have hit 10 times, and therefore have done 10x of its total damage.  I had /u/00-Evan give me the stat changes when you use a weightstone, and used information on the wiki to find out how the gladiator combo buff increases damage, and then... did the thing in the link."
PixelDungeon,2tjdhw,TheCanadianAlligator,2,Sat Jan 24 19:29:02 2015 UTC,"There's an added twist to those calculations, though: if you do less damage in each hit, you'll have a harder time overcoming the damage resistance of tougher monsters.  So that light knuckleduster that worked so well for you in the early game may get you killed later on.  I've found that I almost never want to use the weightstone in Shattered, with the sole exception of using ""light"" on high-tier weapons that start out slow."
PixelDungeon,2thtd5,STaY_TUNeD,1 point,Sat Jan 24 07:14:17 2015 UTC,Have you tried using the weightstone to make the boomerang heavier? Does a ton of damage.

Degradation is idiotic in a game where you might (randomly) never see a new weapon.  The real point is too many people were ""winning"" and bragging about it online.

It's other incidents that I am talking about, where you actually have control. And I don't think the massive amounts of wins were the problem, especially because of what Watabou said (massively upgrading one item that you grinded for (how?), which wasn't that viable a strategy before either - he tried to make that harder, and other, more balanced strats much more sensible).

I stayed and continued to fight (mostly because I had no other choice), and, despite the odds, finally finished it off. My sense of victory upon delivering the killing strike was cut very short, however, when my character immediately died of hunger without getting another turn.  Yes, that can happen."

PixelDungeon,2tc4lz,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Fri Jan 23 03:05:50 2015 UTC,It's more than a decent weapon if you keep throwing upgrade scrolls into it. But it becomes arguably the best weapon when you reach strength lvl 19 and beyond. In other words it's decent for most of the game and devastating at endgame. Your strenght level matters. It was'nt a mistake to keep the glaive though.

PixelDungeon,2tc4lz,EstherDarkish,1 point,Fri Jan 23 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"The ring of force is nice and scaleable, it will always be decent enough for you to do well assuming you find strength potions, but it tends to lag behind other gear a bit. This changes if you're able to boost your strength over the usual max with a ring of might, which lets the ring outscale any other weapon in the game. In normal cases though, especially as it can't be enchanted, the ring will be outpaced by a glaive."

I think it makes really fun gameplay for both players doing well and those who aren't. Players who are behind are going to want to find a way out of the floor ASAP, perhaps return once they've leveled a bit.

That's your strongest weapon. Use the incendiary dart first if he's on dry ground, then move in for melee.  He'll teleport away, maybe even before you get in a hit.   Forget that cursed sword. Try the mace instead.   Repeat this pattern. when he's at a distance, hit him with the incendiary dart and try to get him on fire. Then move in for melee. He'll teleport away. Incendiary dart, melee.  If you can't get to him because of the traps, throw a (regular) dart onto the trap.   I don't think the Javelin is much help here. He doesn't walk, just teleport.

Use the javelins too - they do a lot of damage and also the effects persist over couple of turns.   Only when i've got no ranged options left would i go and attack him, your melee weapons aren't that great.   Basically, make sure every turn you make he's taking damage - even if he dodges, which he will!  Good luck.   PS - you shouldn't really need more than a couple of healing potions, maybe 3. Tengu can't do that much damage, and is pretty consistent with the amount of damage he does.  PPS - i agree with gohjohn that the mace (not quarterstaff!) is probably your best bet out of your available melee weapons and the fact you have a scroll of remove curse.

PixelDungeon,2sw4yu,jyjjy,2,Mon Jan 19 15:21:31 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you are trying to say. The game's mechanics don't change because it is you playing. Every suprise attack is a 100% hit for everyone and you can get them easily by just going through any door with the ghost following you. Ghosts aren't hard to deal with at all if you do this and definitely not a reason to choose one class over another.

Going halfway with upgrading the boomerang doesn't really work imo. Keep throwing upgrades at it and balance for speed combined with the sniper skill and it's a great weapon that kills most enemies before they can even touch you. She also synergizes very well with almost all of the non-battle wands and otherwise meh glyphs like bounce, displacement and affection. A lot of the seeds and potions are also more useful to her as well. Definitely the most fun sub-class imo, I recommend yo give sniper another try."
PixelDungeon,2su7ur,jyjjy,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"Just got to level 20 with Huntress, first time beyond level 5 with her.  While tricky, she offers more options than the Warrior.  I think I lucked out with a ton of upgrade scrolls, and fluked a Warhammer +1 as backup, so had Scale +7 and 'rang +7 at the end, with ss ring +3.  How much, in that situation, should I have upgraded the ss ring?"
PixelDungeon,2su7ur,NeedWittyUsername,2,Mon Jan 19 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"+3 sounds about right. Honestly I usually put almost every upgrade into the boomerang, maybe one or two into armor(and upgrade at the blacksmith), and ignore melee entirely apart from if I happen to find something worth using up close still vs the upgraded boomerang.   Usually end up with +10-12 boomerang, enchanted and balanced for speed and rarely have problems beating the game, even exploring the demon halls fully. Enchanted and balanced for speed plus the sniper perk is kickass as the balancing allows for more hits which means more application of the sniper perk and even more hits and at high level almost every hit will apply enchantment.  Often key is wands for the sniper. Always ask for a non-battle wand from the magician as the are almost all very useful. Slowness, blink, teleportation, flock and regrowth are all great for sniper, and amok not bad. Telekenesis still pretty useless as usual."

Each bonus from an upgrade is effectively multiplied by 2. Sure, the +1 to max damage isn't impressive when doubled to +2, but the +1x2 min damage is better than any other weapon. The extra strength bonus is also doubled. So, a warrior with 18 strength would be doing, in one full turn ((base damage + str bonus) x blows per round)...  +0 knuckleduster = ((1 + 0) x 2) to ((5 + 8) x 2) = 2 to 26 damage  +0 longsword = ((4 + 0) x 1) to ((22+2) x 1) = 4 to 24 damage  +0 glaive = ((5 + 0) x 1) to ((30 + 0) x 1 = 5 to 30 damage  +6 knuckleduster = ((7 + 0) x 2) to ((11 + 14) x 2) = 14 to 50 damage  +6 longsword = ((10 + 0) x 1) to ((46 + 8) x 1) = 10 to 54 damage  +6 glaive = ((11 + 0) x 1) to ((60 + 6) x 1) = 11 to 66 damage  The knuckleduster is on par with damage compared to a longsword, with their average damage being exactly the same.

PixelDungeon,2st6oh,00-Evan,2,Sun Jan 18 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if someone could make the flair maybe we could assign it. I don't really have enough time, energy, or experience to make a whole new set of flairs, so for now it will just be a spot on the standings."
PixelDungeon,2st6oh,AUGA3,3,Sun Jan 18 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"I could apply a basic 'shattered' filter to all the current sprites, a similar tear effect like with the menu button, and perhaps a light darken effect, should distinquish them quite nicely without needing to make entirely new sprites."

PixelDungeon,2sr6g9,DirtyGingy,2,Sat Jan 17 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"Great video! Except for that unfortunate death to the statue :(  For future reference, you can use the examine tool (? button in the toolbar) to examine the animated statue. This will tell you what weapon it wields, and from that you can decide if you think it's worth it to go for. Also, this is extremely useful for strategically fighting the statue - for example, if you see it has a blazing weapon, you might position yourself over water and throw scrolls to safety."

PixelDungeon,2snzfr,davidsverse,4,Fri Jan 16 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"You don't actually have to use cloth or leather armor to get that rogue dodge bonus. You gain the dodge bonus for every point of strength you have beyond the requirement of your armor. So if you have say, +6 plate armor (11 strength requirement) and 18 strength you'll get a pretty good bonus."
PixelDungeon,2snzfr,floatingcoffins,2,Sat Jan 17 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"Dodge is more of a bonus than a main feature of the Rogue IMHO. It is especially powerful in endgame since strength potions and upgrade scrolls ensure you will always have more strength than the armor requires (each extra str is 1 dodge stat). It is especially good for rushing through demon halls, since you can evade magic attacks (thus reducing how much resources you need to use to get to the last boss). They simply have the best defence in the game since they can have both the damage absorbtion of plate + a bigger chance to avoid dmg completely. Considering the fact that it also takes longer for Rogue to get hungry (the starving damage is a bigger deal at low lvl) makes him the easiest class to beat the game with."
PixelDungeon,2snzfr,Britsman,2,Fri Jan 16 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"Having to ID strength potions and not starting with a free upgrade scroll use makes him harder to get off the ground with than Warrior, though.

PixelDungeon,2snzfr,RSquared,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"True, but upgrading the ring the rogue starts with works pretty well too (especially as Assassin).

PixelDungeon,2snzfr,Britsman,2,Tue Jan 20 17:50:26 2015 UTC,I was wondering about the armor thing too. I have a lot of difficulty with the rogue - it is the only class I haven't beat tengu with yet.
PixelDungeon,2snzfr,STaY_TUNeD,2,Sat Jan 24 06:44:37 2015 UTC,"I'd upgrade leather armor, not cloth. Still not a big difference in weight and evasion stuff, but you can still take a hit if luck frowns upon you."
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,CubeCode,14,Fri Jan 16 05:56:24 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for making the music for Pixel Dungeon! I'm going to get working on some special flair for you right after this post!  Anyway, there was some discussion about this yesterday here, and the general opinion was that new music would be greatly appreciated. It's fantastic to think that you would be considering adding more music, and I'm sure everyone here would love it. I can't wait to hear what the community has to say - I'll be stickying this to make sure it receives attention.  EDIT: /u/CubeCode has provided proof with the mods.  EDIT 2: Special flair up!"
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,roastedlasagna,3,Fri Jan 16 06:16:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the awesome flair! That was really quick.
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,00-Evan,5,Fri Jan 16 07:10:26 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! Feel free to change the text if you like, I just figured that seemed the most appropriate. Watabou (/u/watawatabou) is ""Developer of Pixel Dungeon,"" so I think ""Composer of Pixel Dungeon"" complements that nicely."
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,RatPuncher,16,Fri Jan 16 07:16:11 2015 UTC,"Hey Cube Code, I've actually been wanting to contact you about this, but couldn't find any way of doing so!  As far as the presentation of the game goes, one of the biggest things I think could be improved is the lack of variety in music. While yes some people will play with it off, I absolutely think it's worthwhile to add a greater diversify of music to the game. Please let me know if you decide you want to make more music, I'd love to be involved if possible."
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,00-Evan,11,Fri Jan 16 06:30:17 2015 UTC,I just recently discovered your PD fork and I'd be happy to contribute content! I really appreciate watabou releasing the source code and allowing the community to improve/change it to their liking. The response to this has been positive and I'm pumped to add whatever I can!
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,eavc,6,Fri Jan 16 06:56:14 2015 UTC,Idea: What if there was a new donate-only item called the Code Cube that could unlock a secret song in the game. An in game omage to the composer. The money could go towards funding some new tracks.
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,koolkanadian13,4,Fri Jan 16 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"Hey Rat Puncher, great to hear from you!  Some sort of jukebox device would make for a nice donation reward, exclusive tracks would be possible but it may make more sense to put that production effort into improving the music that everyone gets to hear. Letting players pick what song they hear no matter where they are in the dungeon could work very well though.  Still, this is getting ahead of ourselves a little, we need to make the new music first!"
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,TheCanadianAlligator,8,Fri Jan 16 21:27:46 2015 UTC,The title theme is brilliant. There was a while where I'd open the app just to hear it.

PixelDungeon,2slpxz,cheetac19,7,Fri Jan 16 07:36:15 2015 UTC,"Ya dude rad tunes but I think it would be cool if there was a different song for every level of the dungeon, like sewer,prison,cave... each one has there own."
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,AcuriousPotat0,1 point,Fri Jan 16 06:14:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts.  Sewers has a kind of ""crawling"" feel to it. So the music right now is fine. Prison is a crazy place. Give the music to the crazy thief - it's still, to some extent, fun and games. The adventurer is after the Amulet still having enthusiasm, and the fight with Goo strengthened their resolve if anything. Unfathomable amounts of treasure is still within reach!  Mines is more of a deep, dank, and most importantly, dangerous area. Some kind of ambient music with a 'suspended' feeling, a bit of echo, and the odd water drop, would be good.  Metropolis is- er, was a very prosperous place, but it was destroyed by the occult arts. So yeah. (I don't know either.)  Demon Halls is a dark, evil land of carnage and death. Best not to stick around. An angry feel is good here, like music from Doom.  ...yes, this is just a repost from the other thread."
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,lucasvb,4,Wed Jan 21 01:28:49 2015 UTC,Love the music man. It was one of the very first features that stood out to me that made me love this game. We hope to see you add some additional tracks and boss music!
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,baniel105,4,Fri Jan 16 21:05:48 2015 UTC,The music in Pixel Dungeon is great! Adds a cheerful note to the difficult game. A different song for each level set would be cool though. Or maybe like a suspence song that starts playing when your health gets low.
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,Upside-DownFish,3,Fri Jan 16 21:26:41 2015 UTC,That's a great idea! I'll see what I can do.

PixelDungeon,2slpxz,pumpkinburger,3,Fri Jan 16 07:47:43 2015 UTC,Just wanted to say that I love your music!
PixelDungeon,2slpxz,AcuriousPotat0,2,Fri Jan 16 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"Huh, there was just a thread not too long ago asking if people wanted more music in the game. It looks like the overall consensus seems to be yes. However, we understand if you won't be able to accomplish your ""ideal"" goal.

PixelDungeon,2so2pp,Artius,3,Fri Jan 16 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm currently investigating another user giving a report on this so your post is quite timely. I'm willing to bet (though I have not confirmed yet) that this is an issue with the hourglass. What floor did you get the hourglass on, and how far upgraded was it? Also, let me know if this freeze issue persists for you after a restart.  edit: also the latest version is 0.2.3d, but this issue was not addressed in that patch."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,2,Fri Jan 16 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"I got the hourglass very early - perhaps even the first floor.  I purchased sand at the first two shops, so it is +4.  Didn't make it to the third shop obviously.  I didn't use it in fighting DM300, so it may have been fully charged when I descended."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,2,Fri Jan 16 21:23:13 2015 UTC,"Charge doesn't matter, I've looked at the code and I'm almost certain this is being caused by the shop on floor 16 trying to stock sand pouches.  When a shop is placing items within itself it'll try to fill the outer rim first, and then fill the rest of the room, however, from looking at the code, it seems that if there are more items than the shop has room, it'll get stuck in an infinite loop looking for a free space that doesn't exist. This is a source bug, but the added sand bags make it far more likely to occur.  As a temporary fix, keep trying to descend, this won't damage your save and it will work after a couple tries at most. You may run into a similar issue on floor 21.  I'll work on a fix and include it in the next patch, possibly this evening."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,3,Fri Jan 16 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"Cool.  That worked.  I was able to load the save and descend successfully on the second try.  The shop that was generated has two sandbags.  Not sure if that's supposed to happen or not, but since it was a little unexpected, I thought i'd mention it."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,Britsman,2,Fri Jan 16 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"yep, two is the correct number. I'll work on some logic so that level generation will fail and retry if the shop isn't big enough, rather than freezing.  Good luck on your run!"
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,3,Fri Jan 16 21:54:08 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I ended up ascending with the amulet!
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,Britsman,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"Nice debugging, I have had users with stuck on descend issues in my mod as well, and I was suspecting that the shop had something to do with it but was unsure."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,3,Fri Jan 16 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"From some investigating, it looks like the hard limit for items in a shop is 39 (a room has a max of 8x5 internal space, need 1 more spot for the shopkeeper), but as long as the limit is respected level gen is totally unaffected.  My plan is to rework the shop painter slightly to allow for item generation to be referenced externally, then when the shop room is created the level gen logic can generate the list (still contained in the painter), and ensure the room is large enough to fit the items, then when the painter is called it can reference the already initialized list. If the list is larger than 39 items, throw a RunTimeException.  edit: this should do it: https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/commit/a1754cd68a5fb5da01af68504e1b8b0d5591c4ec"
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,Britsman,1 point,Sat Jan 17 08:32:45 2015 UTC,"Neat, I personally went with the route to only try and place each item 10 times rather than infinitely (so avoid descend freeze at the cost of a miniscule probability that some item will be missing in shop). I also upped so that shops will choose bigger rooms compared to other special rooms. One issue I had until I forced bigger rooms is that any item that doesn't get generated on the sides of the shop becomes free (related to the ""player drops item inside shop"" code?)"
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,2,Sat Jan 17 11:05:35 2015 UTC,"Did you change painters to return a boolean in order to enable levelgen failing at that level? I would have done that too but I didn't want to change the overall structure right now, I may overhaul that in future."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,VeradilGaming,1 point,Sat Jan 17 17:04:33 2015 UTC,My current code allows shops to be created with some items missing if the room was not large enough. All the painters who use my placeItems/placeMobs functions in the Painter superclass follow the same logic of try 10 times rather than try forever. In RegularLevel for custom maps it uses a boolean to indefinitely throw away the current map and restart unless all specialrooms (max 4) were placed.
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,2,Sat Jan 17 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"I see, certainly if you've already adjusted levelgen to allow for that it makes more sense to integrate it with your exiting logic. Also, from the perspective that your game is about customization, it makes more sense to allow for shops to drop items, whereas if a shop had to do that in Shattered it would be because I messed up somewhere."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,VeradilGaming,1 point,Sat Jan 17 18:15:16 2015 UTC,"Mine got stuck when I descended from the DM300 chamber as well, but I didn't have the hourglass? It crashed my game, and I got rollbacked to level 14. Wouldn't have been as bad, if I hadn't have been up to level 19 already, but came back to reforge my armor."
PixelDungeon,2so2pp,00-Evan,2,Sat Jan 17 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"that sounds like a separate issue, did you submit a crash report?"

This sort of 'ghost mode' happens when the player is reduced to 0 HP or less but the game fails to check they have died.  I have no idea what's causing it in this case, I'll investigate."
PixelDungeon,2skw2h,00-Evan,1 point,Fri Jan 16 16:15:12 2015 UTC,I encountered the glitch once again. It seems the death is recorded on the rankings page.  Unfortunately I had a vampiric weapon so I was able to restore my health. But soon I was killed by a warlock.  Traps don't hurt the hero.  But the game crashes if you try to restore your health by sleeping.  Link 1 (Dead yet alive) : Imgur  Link 2 (Rankings screen) : Album
PixelDungeon,2skw2h,harnov,1 point,Sat Jan 17 08:47:33 2015 UTC,"I think I know what causes it. The part of the game code which puts you in dying state checks if HP == 0 instead of <=. This is logical since I guess this thing does a check after damaging thing.  Example:   Hero has 20HP. Rat king hits Hero for 30HP. Final damage calculation with buffs and armor. DMG check: final damage > hero's hp Hero's HP is set to 0 You are dead, not big surprise.   The fall damage somehow just removes the health from you, and dying state works for 0HP. Since it makes sense that jumping into a chasm with low health would kill you noone really did it and seen this bug. So, I guess, your health is below zero. But hey, that's just a theory. A game theory."

If a monster comes into the shop do not attack it.  The shop keeper will run too.  Just let the monster hit you and get out the door.    I honestly think Monsters should not be allowed to enter the shops.  It makes no sense that they can.

The adventurer is after the Amulet still having enthusiasm, and the fight with Goo strengthened their resolve if anything. Unfathomable amounts of treasure is still within reach!  Mines is more of a deep, dank, and most importantly, dangerous area. Some kind of ambient music with a 'suspended' feeling, a bit of echo, and the odd water drop, would be good.  Metropolis is- er, was a very prosperous place, but it was destroyed by the occult arts. So yeah. (I don't know either.)  Demon Halls is a dark, evil land of carnage and death.

I had infact originally fixed 'welcome to the level X of Pixel Dungeon' and 'You now have X', but decided to revert those fixes, they don't really damage clarity, and I find theses sorts of small grammar mistakes charming, especially as they've been highly visible in the game for so long."
PixelDungeon,2s946w,00-Evan,5,Tue Jan 13 06:14:32 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, proper English isn't a priority for programmers. A game designer's priority is more about gameplay and features and art.  It might also be not easy to fix, for example in your case, it is likely that watabou coded it as:  display (""You now have %s"",     item.name)   sure Evan could make it:  display (""You now have %s %s"",     hero.inventory[item].count>0? ""another"":     (item.name.charAt(0).isVowel()?""an"":""a"") ,     item.name)   but this would make it hard for future plans of localization into multiple languages.  Also, there may be many of such quirks.  I propose that we ourselves look through the code and help optimize these issues  I'm sure it would help Watabou and Evan alot if all these quirks could be documented here in this thread.  We can view Shattered's code here.  After we compile a long list, Evan should have an easier time fixing it.  We could even submit it as a pull request    But the question remains, should we care so much about these (imho) minor grammer issues? It's definitely something that should be looked into one day, but MORE FEATURES PLS :P"

PixelDungeon,2s4c0u,gloomndoom,3,Mon Jan 12 02:26:42 2015 UTC,"Hah, thanks.   I got a few tricks I learned/read that helped a lot:   Keep your scrolls safe from fire at all costs, especially the upgrade scrolls. Drop them somewhere safe if you don't plan to use them and collect them after you're done with the level. I always buy the scroll bag from the shop, as it protects them from burning.  Scrolls of magic mapping, scrolls of teleportation, seeds of fadeleaf, potions of invisibility, and potions of mind reading are a huge help in the demon halls. Save them if you can because they allow you to avoid the powerful monsters. Just spearhead to the final boss without wasting health potions. I find armor to be the most important thing in the early game. The goal is to hope for a plate or scale armor so you can tank away at the crabs and Goo. You probably won't have the strength to wear them properly so just switch them on for fights. I ended each of my runs with 40 damage reduction on my armors (except on my assassin). Bad luck with armor is usually the cause of my death before/at Goo. Don't go up/down stairs unless you have to. It starves you very fast. Try to have a seed of earthroot for Goo and Yog.  For the yog fight, lead the fists away and then use whatever mobility items you have to get to the eye asap. Try to position yourself in a way like in my picture and start attacking to surround yourself with larva. Then you can continue whacking away at the eye while taking minimal damage. I've been avoiding putting inscriptions on my armors. IMO they will most likely hurt you more than benefit you.   Good luck, have fun!"

PixelDungeon,2s3nwf,Anaweir,4,Sun Jan 11 23:37:46 2015 UTC,I would like the up to 4 quick-shots but done slightly differently:  All quick-shot buttons would be visible all the time.  The attack button would appear at the same X as normal but be 'pushed up' by the (>2) quick-shot buttons.  The Inventory button is pushed left by the (>1) quick-shot buttons.  The continue button would always be above the inventory button (wherever it happens to be.)  This way the attack button would be the same with 1-2 extra quick-shots and always at the same X.  The continue button would always be above the inventory button.
PixelDungeon,2s3nwf,poiuyterry,2,Mon Jan 12 07:15:38 2015 UTC,"I voted for 4,but I'm not sure how often I would use more than 2, so I'd probably be happy either way.  If the access to multiple items isn't really easy, then the vanilla style 2 slot would probably be better.   On a side note:  I did want to bring up something that has caused me many a misclick...  When fighting melee, the red button with the image of the monster is a bit small. Misclicks are sometimes disastrous, as it causes me to run away (often far away into rooms full of other mobs!) I would be happy to see it double the size (tall and skinny). Or maybe there is a better way to address this that I'm not thinking of. I know that you can tap anywhere to stop the running, but movement is so fast that I'm often too late to stop the damage."

Curses are a pretty common thing for all equipment and I felt adding them was firstly to ensure consistency, and secondly as a nice way to universally weaken artifacts a little, as they seem to be regarded as near universally better than rings.  Regarding degradation in vanilla, I have decided not to implement it, or a similar system. I do agree with Watabou's intention though, and I will try to accomplish his goal through different means."
PixelDungeon,2rwwiq,jyjjy,3,Sat Jan 10 02:59:35 2015 UTC,"It's not just the curses, it's some of the nerfing... For example, I get that Invisibility + missile attack is a bit of an exploit, but let's face it: 1. Invis potions are not that common, and 2. Huntress needs all the help she can get."

It is always a good idea to have a back up weapon in your inventory for disarm.  Also make sure your bag is NOT full.  If you get disarmed and your bag is full you are in a lot of trouble."
PixelDungeon,2rv69k,davidsverse,3,Fri Jan 9 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"4 days ago and have only played 283 games   Woahhhhhh.    Please read this and this first.  There are 4 enemies in the dwarf city.   Fire elementals. They fly and might set you on fire when they hit you. Fire doesn't work on them. Tip: fight above water. Warlocks. They shoot magic that might weaken you. Tip: Fight them in melee combat. Golem. They hit extra hard, but attack at x1/2 speed. Amok doesn't work on them. Tip: none. range them if possible. Monk. They hit at x2 speed. Each hit may disarm you. Tip: none. range them if possible.      You need extremely good armour and weapons in this part of the dungeon. You can't really rush to skip this stage because the next stage is harder (and usually the one skipped). This is a true test of your character. You will need to manage your resources well enough in the earlier levels to succeed here. Above 35 dmg reduction is recommended for armour here. Weapon wise, a +3 tier 5 weapon recommended. I find I need about 10 potions by the time I get here (depends on my setup tho. 20 potions means you almost certainly will win if you aren't careless) Constantly manage your armour degradation with glyphs and enchantments and weightstones in the earlier stages. Always save an upgrade scroll or two for repairs. You should do the ambiguous imp quest to unlock the depth 21 shop.  Save 4 mind vision and 3 map making and 1 invisibility for depths 22-25. Make sure you skip depths 22-24!  Good luck! You will need it. ;)"

But anyways, I used my last arcane stylus and it turned into Displacement.... then i raged (since i'm a Berserker), and closed the game on my phone... after I regained control, I opened the game to find it didn't save my rage quit... so I retried the arcane stylus and managed to get Metabolism...

Saving up a few so you can retry until you get one worth keeping and/or having an upgrade scroll handy to remove the glyph entirely if you end up on one of the terrible ones(anti-entropy, multiplicity, potential) is a good idea."

PixelDungeon,2rsb6m,jengelke,3,Thu Jan 8 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"I think the point of this artefact is to discard your useless/excess potions using it. When upgraded by a little, there will already be some seed savings.  It is probably one of the weakest artefacts, but at least you can unequip it easily  Evan's comment on it: http://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/2p93jp/beta_shattered_pixel_dungeon_v023_the_artifact/cmvab9y"
PixelDungeon,2rsb6m,gohjohn,4,Fri Jan 9 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"I've re-evaluated that point a bit. While I think my initial intention still holds, the numbers are just too low at the moment.  My concern while initially designing the artifact was that I didn't want to make the regrowth+sandals+toolkit combo too good, however, the nerf to health potion farming does give me a bit more room to buff up the toolkit."
PixelDungeon,2rsb6m,00-Evan,2,Fri Jan 9 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the benefit upgraded a little. I used it at +1 and +3 and saw zero benefit. And when using at +3, I barely saw any benefit. Seems neat and is a cool concept, but for the randomness of potions and seeds and the difficulty in getting them in the first place, the benefits are pretty small.  I did not notice any benefit until +10."
PixelDungeon,2rsb6m,00-Evan,2,Fri Jan 9 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"You might find the effect more significant now that patch 0.2.3c is out. Previously the toolkit would scale the average seeds required per potion from 2.7 to 2 as it was upgraded, now it's 2.5 to 1.5, and the probabilities have been tweaked to make the effect more visible as well."

PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,aronnax512,5,Thu Jan 8 22:21:10 2015 UTC,They're typically more trouble than they're worth for high end armor (splint or plate). I do find them useful for low level armor like cloth or leather early in the game. I'm usually waiting for something good to drop and it doesn't hurt that bad if I get a bad glyph on a piece of cloth and have to abandon/replace it.
PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,TheCanadianAlligator,4,Fri Jan 9 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"The Arcane Stylus has caused me nothing but trouble.   You're right, the arcane stylus is nothing but trouble. It has a 25% chance to give you something useful.   ""But gator, there's only 10 glyphs! 25% of 10 is 2.5 - and glyphs can't be split in half!""   That's because metabolism is pretty good, but also pretty bad. It basically gives you a permanent poison debuff that can only be taken away with the use of a food item, but it gives you 1 to 1/5 of total health when it activates (which it has a 2+level/10+level chance of happening).    ""Wouldn't that mean metabolism is kind of a neutral glyph, since its bad traits are countered by its good traits?   The thing is, the bad traits are just so bad, and the good traits are just so good. So no, it's not a neutral glyph, it's more like a mystical cursed treasure. It will help you not die (if it feels like it), but it will also kill you while you're carrying it."
PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,jyjjy,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:17:55 2015 UTC,"Beyond the ones that directly damage you(anti-entropy, multiplicity, potential) I would consider all of them neutral or better considering the armor upgrade.

PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,Superbubba177,1 point,Sat Jan 10 15:38:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't consider affection very neutral...
PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,jyjjy,1 point,Mon Jan 12 21:27:27 2015 UTC,Its downside is not being able to hit a second enemy while dealing with two at once while affectionated. Upside is free attacks with ranged weapons and wands. Personally I would call that balancing out to neutral but I guess it depends on your gear and how careful you are about not having to deal with two enemies at once.
PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,thinbuddha,2,Tue Jan 13 02:08:57 2015 UTC,"I use them to trigger traps. Occasionally I'll actually apply them to armor, but I usually regret it."
PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,BetaMax789,3,Fri Jan 9 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"It honestly never use any unless I have at least 3 (or 2 if you're desperate).  You also save it for high level gear that you don't plan to abandon.  Otherwise, they are good to sell if you got no gold to hold."
PixelDungeon,2rs0ys,Cogman117,2,Thu Jan 8 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it is completely random. Depending on what you want to fight like, some can be beneficial, but most won't.

PixelDungeon,2rrowg,davidsverse,2,Thu Jan 8 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"I really like the redesigned goo level. One of the best things I think Evan did. Makes it more skill and less luck based I think and just overall more interesting. It's a lot of fun when you can find the rat king before fighting the goo and sometimes get a great item for the battle. Not often, but it adds an extra layer of suspense.  I hope he does something similar for some of the other bosses. Tengu is a solid boss. DM300 is ok, but you really just have to hope you have good gear and a lot of healing potions and pound the crap out of him. Not really a ton of strategy to him. The Dwarf King I find far too easy. I think he has killed me once. Yog is a solid boss."

PixelDungeon,2rrowg,JoshuMertens,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Dwarven halls, in my humble opinion, is utterly ruined by the monks.  My favorite levels are 6-9, and the caves aren't bad either."
PixelDungeon,2rq5gj,v3xx,7,Thu Jan 8 08:25:20 2015 UTC,I'm guessing easy mod gives more upgrade scrolls than usual?
PixelDungeon,2rq5gj,gohjohn,2,Thu Jan 8 11:01:37 2015 UTC,Easy mod? Say what now?
PixelDungeon,2rq5gj,kiaha,7,Thu Jan 8 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"Based on his replies here, and the fact that it is very difficult to get over 13 upgrade scrolls legitimately in vanilla or other mods.. I deduce that OP is playing easymode mod(link in sidebar)"
PixelDungeon,2rq5gj,gohjohn,2,Thu Jan 8 19:05:12 2015 UTC,Ah haaaa! Thanks! I was on my phone and didn't see the sidebar. Neat! Thanks :)
PixelDungeon,2rq5gj,kiaha,2,Thu Jan 8 20:35:56 2015 UTC,Yeah man it's pretty fun.
PixelDungeon,2rq5gj,EstherDarkish,6,Thu Jan 8 19:33:13 2015 UTC,I can walk through fire and dance circles around wraiths. That chilling glaive helps too.
PixelDungeon,2rq0ks,MrSelatcia,5,Thu Jan 8 07:16:17 2015 UTC,Well you don't get the Body Bag until you die...so...
PixelDungeon,2rq0ks,davidsverse,5,Thu Jan 8 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes some sense.  So the whole reason why all these bugs are popping up when people die in this release is because of a change to the rankings page.  As you may have noticed, rankings now display your depth and hero level on the right side, I grab the hero level from old runs (for the first time) by loading up your rankings save file and grabbing your hero level, after your rankings have been loaded up and saved once (ending a game without crashing does this) this never happens again. The thing is that loading up a save file like that while a game is in progress is problematic, this is what was originally causing the crashes, and since that is fixed it's also causing a chance to duplicate inventory related badges.  Given that in this example your ranking is submitting properly and all the new info is being saved, I'm pretty sure this should only ever happen to you once. While it does seem buggy, i'm willing to accept this sort of small one-time visual thing in exchange for properly extracting all that info.  If this keeps happening though, that's a different story, let me know.  EDIT: actually, just thought of a better way to handle this, should finally put this to rest so even little bugs don't happen. I'll roll it into the next patch which should be tonight or tomorrow."
PixelDungeon,2rq0ks,00-Evan,2,Thu Jan 8 12:42:58 2015 UTC,I died on depth 2 to a gnoll this morning.  I got the badge and the game crashed.
PixelDungeon,2rq0ks,MoronLessOff,1 point,Fri Jan 9 16:05:26 2015 UTC,What version? This should no longer be happening as of 0.2.3c
PixelDungeon,2rq0ks,00-Evan,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:32:56 2015 UTC,It was 0.2.3b.  I just updated.  Thanks!
PixelDungeon,2rr4za,secret759,6,Thu Jan 8 16:12:43 2015 UTC,You can attack by simply clicking on a enemy next to you
PixelDungeon,2rr4za,DaThompi,7,Thu Jan 8 18:48:46 2015 UTC,You can stay alive...by not dying.
PixelDungeon,2rr4za,davidsverse,2,Thu Jan 8 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"Or just sitting and waiting on a sunglass heals you, in case you are starving."
PixelDungeon,2rr4za,mazaeldemonsouled,2,Sat Jan 10 02:08:34 2015 UTC,If you search then you wait twice as fast
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,DogOfSevenless,21,Wed Jan 7 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"Nope, we're all playing at work when we're not supposed to."
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,FlackBox,19,Wed Jan 7 20:55:17 2015 UTC,I might as well just refer to the bathroom at my office as the pixel dungeon.

PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,Shinji_Ikari,10,Wed Jan 7 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"I turn the music off, but the sfx can be pretty handy sometimes so I leave that on."
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,Cool_Muhl,2,Wed Jan 7 20:00:58 2015 UTC,Ditto. The music gets a tad boring after a while. Could use some new tracks.
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,kare_kano,4,Wed Jan 7 22:48:57 2015 UTC,At least different tracks for different dungeon themes.
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,Negirno,6,Thu Jan 8 09:48:19 2015 UTC,"Depends, if I'm in a public place with no earbuds then no audio or just sfx.  If I'm in private or I have buds I'll have sfx on and listen to music while I play."
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,00-Evan,2,Wed Jan 7 21:28:32 2015 UTC,I love the Pixel Dungeon soundtrack and always play with the music on. I hardly ever play at work though.
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,VlermuisVermeulen,1 point,Thu Jan 8 08:53:42 2015 UTC,Never have it on.
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,Dreteus,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:24:51 2015 UTC,nope. music and sfx are kind of annoying in my opinion.
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:07:33 2015 UTC,I play with both on.
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,colorwizard,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:57:13 2015 UTC,I have the music turned off but the SFX on when I can (when I'm not at work)
PixelDungeon,2rnqj1,riannargh,1 point,Thu Jan 8 02:22:45 2015 UTC,"Sometimes on the subway, I'll keep the sfx on, but have my own music playing. At home, I usually play with both music and sfx on. With friends/at work/school, no sound."

PixelDungeon,2rpdb2,RedBombX,2,Thu Jan 8 03:23:54 2015 UTC,Guess Not...
PixelDungeon,2rpdb2,PiousKnyte,2,Thu Jan 8 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"16-20 are really difficult levels. I feel like I always run into trouble there. Despite normally making it to level 16 without issue, I've rarely even made it past the Dwarf King, and I've only made it to the Eye once."
PixelDungeon,2rpdb2,davidsverse,3,Thu Jan 8 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"The Dwarven levels are the most strategic in the game.  It's all about where and how you fight.    Elementals:  Always get to water before you fight them.    Warlocks.  Doors and corners.  Melee only.   Monks.  Weaken them with ranged attacks, then kill them fast using a door for surprise if you can, make sure to have a 2nd weapon handy.  Monks suck.  Golems.  Range as much as possible, they hit hard."
PixelDungeon,2rpdb2,XarxD,2,Thu Jan 8 19:02:56 2015 UTC,Them's the breaks. Too bad you couldn't find anything better than that mace.
PixelDungeon,2rpdb2,Buster-99,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no longswords or axes. Found 3 artifacts though..."
PixelDungeon,2rpdb2,Geniusthe3rd,2,Thu Jan 8 04:47:17 2015 UTC,Need about 15 potions of health
PixelDungeon,2rq8aw,KatzOfficial,5,Thu Jan 8 09:10:12 2015 UTC,"Succubus - Teleports towards you; can infatuate you for several turns.  How to beat them - Infatuation only stops you from melee attacks; wands and thrown items should still work.  Scorpio - Moves at least one square out of range; attacks with ranged dart that can poison.  How to beat them - Don't let them attack you! These guys can be infuriating, but they don't attack when you're right next to them. Try to corner them or otherwise immobilize them.  Evil Eye - Shoots disentegration spell from its eye every other turn.  How to beat them - Avoid at all costs! These fuckers pack a punch, and can take what they can dish out. An interesting thing about them is that they don't avoid attacking other mobs so if you have to fight one try placing another mob between you and the eye.  In general, use torches to see farther. As you found out scorpios (and evil eyes) lurk just out of eyesight but within attack range."
PixelDungeon,2rq8aw,AntManMax1,1 point,Thu Jan 8 09:29:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, dude!"
PixelDungeon,2rq8aw,DogOfSevenless,1 point,Thu Jan 8 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to say, I think the Scorpios shoot javelins which cripple you rather tham darts that poison. This means that if you try to chase them while crippled they'd still have an extra turn to shoot you."
PixelDungeon,2rq8aw,MoronLessOff,3,Sun Jan 11 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"I almost always fight through the halls.  One more tip about the Scorpios.  If you do fight one and chase it through a door, just stand outside the door and wait.  More often than not, the Scorpio will pop back through the door to come after you giving you a surprise attack.  You can hit it once and it will run away.  Wait one more turn and they'll come back for more surprise punishment.  Repeat until it's dead."
PixelDungeon,2rp2yc,colorwizard,2,Thu Jan 8 01:54:52 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your generosity =)
PixelDungeon,2rp2yc,00-Evan,1 point,Thu Jan 8 13:15:42 2015 UTC,If I donate ten now and ten later would I get the gold interface and stuff? Like a $20 donation would? Or do I have to buy the $20 one total for it to count?
PixelDungeon,2rp2yc,cheetac19,1 point,Sat Jan 10 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"As the donation description says, your donation can be increased at any time. donating for golden tier will permanently lower the cost of the Shattered tier to $10."
