PhillyUnion,3e0xma,M1K3YP,4,Tue Jul 21 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"I can go either way on Nando.  400k is too much, if we can sign him for cheaper then fine.   Vitoria wasn't bad before his injury, but he wasn't great either. And Marquez has been better and makes nothing. Let Vitoria's loan expire at the end of the season and put that money elsewhere.  But I think ultimately I'd rather see the Union make more moves within the league like they did with Sapong.  You can probably get a better contract, and easier to evaluate the player.    Then you take the money you save and can sign a truly notable player, instead of signing these average guys that demand a large wage simply because they've played in other leagues."
PhillyUnion,3e0xma,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of Fernando, no clue why, just love the dude. However, he's a bit pricey for what he's produced and when we're this financially strapped I honestly would be ok with getting someone else (we would obviously need to sign someone else up top). Vitoria on the other hand needs to go. He's pricey and is not in a spot that we desperately need right now (wings and LB) so I would love using that money elsewhere"
PhillyUnion,3e0xma,bterre108,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:05 2015 UTC,"I like Fernando's attitude he seems like he has a ""Philly"" personality but we dont need him. We need someone with speed to counter like Sapong."
PhillyUnion,3e0xma,LeDoop,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"Nando, he's been injured and when he has played they try to shoehorn him in by himself up top which is obviously not his strong suit, I think Nando and Sapong up front could be a very dangerous combo, but we'll never play 2 strikers so what's the point"
PhillyUnion,3e0xma,EdBacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"Fernando... if he doesn't see much more playing time then we won't have much to justify paying his large salary. Same deal with Vittoria, although he makes more and was probably less impressive during his short time on the field. Both appear injury prone, and both have been replaced by players who are at least as good, if not better, and are being paid 1/3rd as much."
PhillyUnion,3e0xma,mtommyboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:18:50 2015 UTC,It's so tough to say for me right now. Both have been out so much due to injury it's hard to get a good read. I'd say yes to nando because he's shown he can be a game changer for us and is also young. Vitoria though has not impressed me at all and would need to step it up and stay healthy to convince me to keep him.

He'll be 21 next season and is under contract till next summer. You can negotiate with soon-to-be free agents in January so we could tie him up early.

PhillyUnion,3dz60k,spqr-king,0,Mon Jul 20 22:16:49 2015 UTC,Do they? Your telling me you think the keepers we have come even close to the experience and skill Guzan could bring to the Union?
PhillyUnion,3dz60k,Mike81890,2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"Experience and skill are awesome, but in MLS I find there's a sort of diminishing return with keepers. Spending more only gets you x% better. I think if you're going to spend Guzan money in a league like this, on a roster like this, you would be much better served with another attacking player"
PhillyUnion,3dz60k,spqr-king,0,Mon Jul 20 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of needs keeper is just one I rate on the high end of things its personal. We need a solid keeper one who has experience commanding the box and has been solid for awhile. This constant influx of keepers who realistically are not even close to top ten in MLS has to stop at some point and Guzan could be that keeper who sticks around and makes a difference. Sure there are others you could go to and obviously he isnt the most economical choice but it would end the constant stream of subpar keepers. I get Andre could be the next big thing but two knee injuries have me worried. MacMath could come back and own it or he could not. Sylvestre could be the answer. All of these things are uncertain and to me that is something you dont want in that position. In my mind our areas of need are GK, LB, Winger, Striker in that order but all of them are key if we want to get anywhere."

PhillyUnion,3dva44,Ihave2thumbs,3,Sun Jul 19 20:32:17 2015 UTC,Honestly I would say we make some textbook tackles when they are needed and half of our fouls are from Edu so if he can straighten up we will be golden lol
PhillyUnion,3dva44,spqr-king,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:39 2015 UTC,Marquez has been money with textbook tackles. Love that guy.

PhillyUnion,3dva44,spqr-king,3,Mon Jul 20 00:05:29 2015 UTC,Yea he gets booked often thats why he is on his second accumulation suspension this season. If he could cut that shit out it would be awesome lol
PhillyUnion,3dva44,TheDuckyNinja,3,Mon Jul 20 00:07:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a combination of two things:   Our tactics are super conservative.  You ever notice how huge gaps open up between our mids and our striker(s)?  Our mids drop way back.  This means less fouling because we're both in a good position and often because we're not actively trying to win the ball back. Our personnel just isn't very physical.  Nogueira and Carroll are MLS runts.  Maidana is afraid of contact.  Wenger and Le Toux don't do much of anything out on the wings other than put some light pressure on their man if it comes out there.   I will say that this appears to be the exact opposite of MLS, because most of the top foul guys are mids."
PhillyUnion,3drq6u,SolskjaerOlsen,3,Sat Jul 18 20:37:00 2015 UTC,nice vuvuzela
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,Dean_Moriarty,16,Sat Jul 18 22:09:01 2015 UTC,Le Toux and White were pretty poor.  Nogueira was out muscled the whole game.   Ayuk was fighting hard and creating some chances.   And Casey really is a game changer. Hope he stays healthy.
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,thelostdolphin,2,Sat Jul 18 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, Le Toux was very bad, gave the ball away almost every time he had the ball. On the other hand, I feel bad for White. Without Edu, our defense was not as organized as it could have been against Giovinco.   <3 Ayuk, Nog (even if he was weaker this game), and Maidana, they've been my three favorite players this season.   Casey most of the time looks clumsy, but I was happy to see him score."
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,Incara1010,-4,Sun Jul 19 03:51:05 2015 UTC,Don't say Casey is a game changer around here. It'll get you down voted. (it's true though.)
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,xenoletum,2,Sat Jul 18 22:14:27 2015 UTC,He really isnt... He is a solid player but 9/10 times he isnt going to do what he did tonight especially if he starts.
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,spqr-king,4,Sun Jul 19 01:03:16 2015 UTC,He shouldn't start. But he's a great sub
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,midwesternhousewives,2,Sun Jul 19 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like Fernando can fill that role next season because I dont see Casey, Le Toux or Carroll coming back to be honest. Their age is starting to become more and more apparent."
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,spqr-king,3,Sun Jul 19 01:14:10 2015 UTC,"We're not paying a DP to be a sub.  Well, I mean we shouldn't but who knows, we might."
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,EdBacon,2,Sun Jul 19 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Its the Union bruh if CJ keeps scoring Fernando will never see the field again (other than next OC match) with their salaries being so far apart. He shouldnt have been a DP anyway this team barters like a 3 year old going to bed.   ""I dont want to""   ""Go to bed""  ""ok"""
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,spqr-king,2,Sun Jul 19 10:53:21 2015 UTC,What do you think a game changer is? Someone who comes in as a sub and changes it. I never said he should be starting.
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,xenoletum,4,Sun Jul 19 02:41:16 2015 UTC,I think a game changer is someone who can do that consistently which Casey cannot. I like the big man but he is dead weight on the roster at this point. Good goal yesterday glad he scored it but 9/10 times thats not happening.
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,spqr-king,3,Sun Jul 19 10:55:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought the Union looked the better team for most of the game. Our weak spot was clearly Giovinco and Altidore against Marquez and White. The ten minutes of the game where TFC was able to consistently get the ball in that area they scored both goals and had most of their chances. Outside of that the Union were able to control the possesion, keep Giovinco and Altidore mostly out of the game and off of the ball. Sapong looked active early and had about three good chances in the first ten minutes. If one of those goes in, and they're able to hold possesion as well as they do its a very impressive performance against one of the best teams in the league on the road.   At the same time the defending on Gio's goal was absolutely frustrating. If your defense is giving up that kind of rebound to a man half their size, even if he's as quick as Giovinco, you don't really deserve the points."
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,bmangan,5,Sun Jul 19 12:32:15 2015 UTC,Thats what you get when you have a team that is invested in and prospering and a team that is literally running on fumes. I can understand the whole moneyball tactic but in order to succeed you have to make the right choices which time and time again this owner and the FO have proven they cannot do. Poor performances by a lot of the players and our 4 (im sorry 5) highest paid players are not on the pitch and probably wouldnt have changed the results if they were. Ayuk is still one of the most exciting player to watch on this team and he is making peanuts. So many emotions right now I might want to stop while I am ahead I love this team and hate that its not being taken care of.
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,spqr-king,4,Sat Jul 18 23:07:12 2015 UTC,First Union game I haven't watched in three years. Decided to watch the USA vs Cuba match and my mood is much better for it.
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,EdBacon,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"Fuck this fuck that fuck all of it. That uncalled penalty against Pfeffer is gonna keep me pissed til Monday. I'm not going to say that the Union deserved to draw this game by leaps and miles, players made mistake.   I feel like the defense could've pressed a little bit higher on that initial Giovinco shot before the goal, Sylvestre could have pushed the ball out to a less than ideal area for Giovinco to finish his dinner.   Le Toux forgot how to pass, White needs to work on his positioning/marking.   Having to sub off for that many injuries in one game blows, simple as that.  Fuck.  Nice goal by Casey though, and still happy with the hustle and movement that Sapong offers  Edit: draw, not win  Also,  Ethan White, for the first goal, cannot just be standing there 3 yards ahead of the rest of the defensive line. His positioning or lack thereof, was the sole reason why that space opened up for Delgado to run in behind. He wasn't even pressing Gio, just standing there waiting for Gio to come to him.  Gaddis maybe should have tracked the runner (Delgado) better but I feel like that was White's fault mainly."
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,cuzigothye,3,Sat Jul 18 22:27:21 2015 UTC,That goal was in no way Sylvestre's fault that save was fantastic the defense needs to follow shots like that up a keeper cant grab a ball going that fast at them and he sure as hell cant choose what way it deflects that quickly. I was just happy it went the opposite way of the net. The defense let Gio walk through and score.
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:58:22 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm questioning Sylvestre a little bit is because keepers are coached to try to push the ball outwards when making a save so it doesn't land right back to the striker's feet for round two. What made it suspect, was the fact that it went almost directly back into Gio's path but I'm willing to give sylvestre the benefit of the doubt since I'm not keeper and the ball was fast.  I'm not going to disagree about the defense, I feel they didn't close Gio down effectively and they were just left ball watching, allowing Gio to score"
PhillyUnion,3ds0dq,cuzigothye,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:19:45 2015 UTC,That kick was an absolute laser dude im pretty sure that save was purely reactionary with little thought. He is suspect to me because of the difference in quality we have seen defensively from the beginning of the season. I am almost sure that is why he has as many clean sheets as he does because it seems like he is having to save much fewer shots than both previous keepers. I also wonder how MacMath would have done with an Edu Marquez CB pairing.

PhillyUnion,3dqdgm,zb313,3,Sat Jul 18 13:59:23 2015 UTC,He looked rusty in the friendly. I wonder if he isn't fully match fit
PhillyUnion,3dqdgm,Mike81890,3,Sat Jul 18 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"I think the Bournemouth friendly was his first time back on the field. He might play today, but it could be White too."

PhillyUnion,3dqdgm,Mike81890,3,Sat Jul 18 15:22:57 2015 UTC,"Do we know that White and Marquez are starting? That worries me a little. I wouldn't blame Jimmy for going 4 3 2 1 with a little more to clog up the midfield and shield the defense.   Carroll barely leaving the defense with Pfeffer and Nogueira in front, Maidana on the wing. It looked like Chaco was playing wider in the friendly."
PhillyUnion,3dqdgm,thelostdolphin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'd be very surprised if it wasn't White and Marquez. Curtin will likely ease Vitoria back into regular play and having to shut down Giovinco on the road is probably not the greatest time to throw him in.   I'm nervous about White, but hopefully the midfield (especially Carroll) cuts Gio off at the pass.  Also, as great of a spark plug as Fabinho's been, he's really got to commit defensively to this game. Toronto's defensive is porous enough that I think Sapong and company can generate some goals without everyone playing high up."
PhillyUnion,3dqdgm,M_Me_Meteo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed about Fabi, but we have to push to develop things in the midfield; and after last week Chaco and Nogs are gonna have targets on their backs."
PhillyUnion,3dqdgm,thelostdolphin,2,Sat Jul 18 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that Chaco and Nogueira will have targets on their backs, but it could work in our favor. If defenders double up on them to try and close them down, hopefully they can push the ball out to Wenger and he can press into the box or offer crosses into Sapong before the defenders have time to switch back. I'm not too worried offensively about this game. Giovinco, rightfully so, scares me."
PhillyUnion,3dqdgm,M_Me_Meteo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"Either Carroll needs to commit to a largely defensive roll or we need to try to create oportunities from the back. If we stuff everyone on the back line I think it'll be a long tense game, but if we take initiative we can control the pace. I'm more worried about Bradley being that second defender and dispossessing the shit out of us in the midfield."

So if Mo makes $700k a year...let's say he's rated at 85 on a 100 scale where 0 is M'Bolhi and 100 is Giovinco.   $700k/85 = about $8200 per point of awesomeness.  As noted above, M'bolhi is useless and is rated as 0.  You can't divide by zero. Its against the laws of mathematics. If the author attempted to do this, the laws of the universe would unravel and we'd all die.   Hence, no mention of Rais."

Meanwhile half our contributing players are being given peanuts in comparison.   Case in point: The Union are paying Vittoria and M'Bolhi a combined $750k. Their replacements (Marquez and Sylvestre), who have arguably played much better, are paid a whopping $120k, combined."
PhillyUnion,3dmu4i,EdBacon,10,Fri Jul 17 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"Nogs and Chaco are the only ones worth their salary on this list.  I like Mo, but he got overpaid.  Good for him, I guess.   I'd like to see Vitoria traded in for a slightly used left winger."
PhillyUnion,3dmu4i,TriflingHotDogVendor,3,Fri Jul 17 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure players on loan like Valdes don't count against the cap, so that money isn't ""tied up"". Who knows what the team is liable for, for that bozo. Still, the point remains that the FO are horribly mismanaging the resources applied to players. (Edit: I see the 3 could be Vitoria, Nando, M'Bohli who come to over a mill so fair enough. Carry on.)"
PhillyUnion,3dmu4i,jd158ug,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"Well, unless they loan him indefinitely they would eventually have to move him off the books if they wanted to free up money long term. So in that sense its still tied up, although in the short term they're not liable for anything.   But yeah, Nando takes up almost as much and has made practically no impact."
PhillyUnion,3dmu4i,EdBacon,5,Fri Jul 17 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Considering he's been injured... He made an impact in the few games when he was healthy, and universally loved here while he rode the line of ""it's just a flesh wound, i can still play.""  what happened?"

PhillyUnion,3dmu4i,southerngangster,2,Fri Jul 17 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"You can see how important youth and player development is when you look at the salaries of Sylvestre, Pfeffer, Marquez, and even Ayuk when you think about how important they've been to the team this year.  And looking at Vitoria's 400k right next to Valdes' is worrisome.  You can easily argue that Edu is way overpayed, but he's at least one of the best players on the team and contributing in a massive way.  Can't say that for Vitoria, even when he was playing.   And in regards to Paulson criticizing the accuracy of these numbers, it has been known for awhile that these numbers are not accurate.  They are just estimations and assumptions, some of them more accurate than others, made by the Players Union.   And I would also like to know how, if at all, does allocation money play into these numbers. It's hard to get a full understanding on a players' value without solid salary numbers and knowing how much allocation money is being applied to which players."

The rest are mind boggling to be honest everyone knew Mbolhi would be a bust I cant imagine we will get anywhere near what we paid for him and at this point it seems like they are holding out to avoid embarrassment. Vitoria and Nando were just average for that price range and have made no impact since coming here then again they really have not seen the field.

Maidana is a steal honestly as is Nogiuera if we could get Edu down to 500,000 and trim the fat this team could be so much more..."

PhillyUnion,3dmf8i,Timothy-H,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:15 2015 UTC,"Richie has definitely stepped up big. He had a few hiccups along the way, but the guy has been a beast. Makes you wonder if we'd be better off if we had started the year with this defensive lineup & GK.  BC7 gets a mention from me as well. He wasn't expected to contribute a lot at the beginning of the season (by us anyways), and has looked a lot more like his younger self. Absolutely solid work."
PhillyUnion,3dmf8i,etsjay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"MVP: Maidana, and it's not really close.  he IS our offense.  I get that his workrate could be a little bit higher on defense, but his vision and creativity is the only consistent offensive spark on the entire team.  Most exceeded expectations: Sapong.  I thought this guy was gonna bust.  He's impressed me, although the DUI thing did sour me a bit.  On the field though, he's exceeded my expectations.  The only reason I don't say Marquez is that I expected Marquez to be good whenever he got a chance."
PhillyUnion,3dmf8i,TheDuckyNinja,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"Sapong has been a monster and the most consistent player when healthy and sober. Even when he doesn't score, he is a handful for defenders and frees up his teammates. I love Chaco, but he is nowhere near as consistent."
PhillyUnion,3dmf8i,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:03:49 2015 UTC,Chaco. Followed closely by Nogueira and Sapong.
PhillyUnion,3dilxp,Timothy-H,4,Thu Jul 16 15:53:55 2015 UTC,Noguiera plays well with the new Pirlo NYCFC card. Haven't tried Maidana yet.
PhillyUnion,3dilxp,MrRobertGoulet,2,Thu Jul 16 17:02:59 2015 UTC,Ive used Nogs and Chaco in the attacking 4-3-3 formation. Both are pretty good.  Would love an IF Edu to make a dominate 3-man midfield

PhillyUnion,3disoh,Timothy-H,3,Thu Jul 16 17:37:56 2015 UTC,SOLD!
PhillyUnion,3disoh,TJunior1014,3,Thu Jul 16 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"For the most part, to get something great, you're going to have to give up something great.  But that doesn't mean there aren't guys out there we couldn't get on the cheap that could still help round out the team.   Chris Klute is a guy I think we should be looking at for LB. A year and a half ago people were talking about him as the future at LB for the USMNT when he was with Colorado.  Columbus traded for him during preseason, but haven't really used him that often. Depending on Casey's health prospects, we could probably get Edison Buddle off of LA without much effort. Or even someone like Warren Creavalle for TFC.  He's been apparently pretty bad as a fullback, but he can also play as a winger. My pie-in-the-sky but also somewhat realistic move would be to get Rodney Wallace from Portland.  He can play LB and LW, his playing time is down a bit this year as Portland has other options.  But he would instantly fit in really well the Union's system."
PhillyUnion,3disoh,keystonemike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:00:43 2015 UTC,I would support a move for any legitimate left-footed back.
PhillyUnion,3disoh,kmanns,2,Fri Jul 17 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"Since I'm new to following the team and MLS in general, is there a chance that we could go through the summer window and not sign anyone? If things are truly dire with the Mbohli situation, the FO could spin it as ""Hey, this core group of players is finally clicking, we are going to see where it takes us."""
PhillyUnion,3disoh,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:59:20 2015 UTC,Anything can happen and honestly I would rather have them unload Mbolhi than pick up anyone else.
PhillyUnion,3disoh,Timothy-H,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:21:38 2015 UTC,Maybe trade Casey to Colorado for basically anything we can get? Allows him to retire as a Rapid
PhillyUnion,3disoh,midwesternhousewives,8,Thu Jul 16 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure he wants to retire as a rapid. When he was eligible for the draft that allows players without a contract to be picked up, he declined saying he wanted to play in philly or no where.  But I agree it would be a nice gesture if he wanted it, even though I really like Casey"
PhillyUnion,3disoh,Timothy-H,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:02 2015 UTC,"I like Conor too, but we honestly don't have much use for him. We already have CJ and Aristeguieta, with Catic still in the system too. Can't keep everyone :/"
PhillyUnion,3disoh,thelostdolphin,4,Thu Jul 16 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Casey isn't eating up much money, so he's not blocking us from other acquisitions and he's been a spark plug late in games when he's been subbed in (leading to a goal at least once during one of those times and maybe more).   CJ has been great but can't play 90 mins every game and with Fernando's injury issues, there's still a need in that position.   I do want to see Catic at some point, but I'd rather him get more regular minutes in the lower tier and gradually build up to first team experience than throw him in."
PhillyUnion,3disoh,Timothy-H,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:46:29 2015 UTC,Maybe Catic will get some minutes if we continue through USOC and need to rest players.
PhillyUnion,3disoh,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe. Definitely looking forward to the moment he's ready for first team play so we can see if his college dominance can translate to MLS."
PhillyUnion,3disoh,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:58:56 2015 UTC,Catic will be a USL starter for sure in the first few months of that club if it comes to fruition.
PhillyUnion,3disoh,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:20:56 2015 UTC,First things first we need to unload Mbolhi & Valdes before signing anyone.  Secondly 9/10 chance we use any fund the MLS gave for transfers to pay down the salary of players we already have or sign the two loan players we brought in (Fernando & Vitoria)  Finally we need to strengthen what we already have and improve in a few places. If Vitoria can perform with Marquez we can bump Edu to the DM position Carroll is in since I dont see Carroll being able to play another full season we wont have to worry about CB but we need a non attacking LB despite Fabinho's current form. We cant just swap him in and out with Williams and expect a good result. Someone mentioned Chris Klute why the hell not.
PhillyUnion,3ddxky,spqr-king,8,Wed Jul 15 14:51:17 2015 UTC,Man I just wish they would produce more of these. Easily one of the best jerseys in MLS.

When I tried to return it for exchange, XL was sold out and I've been chasing one down since. I've seen this one pop up a few times on eBay, which hopefully means that price is as unreasonable as I think it is."

PhillyUnion,3dc6sx,jpoRS,4,Wed Jul 15 22:05:45 2015 UTC,"They probably need to agree to pay part of his salary for the remainder of the contract.  Paying $100,000 a year for a player who is no longer on team is better than paying $500,000 for a player you are never going to play again.  But that would also be impossible for Sak to spin M'Bolhi as a good move if they can't at least recoup all the money spent on him."
PhillyUnion,3dc6sx,Dean_Moriarty,7,Wed Jul 15 13:36:44 2015 UTC,That seems to be the hold up. The Turkish deal seemed to fall through due to Nick wanting a higher transfer fee. They really should just cut their losses so they can actually have room to maneuver this transfer window.
PhillyUnion,3dc6sx,FlapjackJackson,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"The window is still open for a bit so I don't think we need to panic but we, and the FO, have to be realistic about M'Bolhi. The Union have zero leverage to negotiate terms with any clubs. Hopefully that means Sak will put his ego aside once it comes down to it and does something to improve the club's situation instead of trying to save face."

PhillyUnion,3db9j5,MrChips217,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah bench players that's what we have needed the rest of the league makes multimillion dollar deals what do we get, bench minutes..."
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,ethic_,9,Wed Jul 15 03:23:38 2015 UTC,Let's look at some of those clubs making multimillion dollar deals shall we...  Seattle Sounders (USL Team- S2)  Toronto FC (USL Team- Toronto FC II)  LA Galaxy (USL Team- LA Galaxy II)  New York Red Bulls (USL Team- New York Red Bulls II)  You know what they all have in common...they all have programs in place to develop the NON Million dollar players which is 95% of their team...if you don't think developing the players on the bench is a good thing don't be pissed if subs and reserves are rusty and fail to develop or start. For a player to stay in form a consistent 60 minutes to a full 90 is so crucial. Having a USL Team in the MLS is going to become a staple for development and the Union are wise to take advantage.
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,MrChips217,-4,Wed Jul 15 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"You are right, and you know what the union, because they are the union, are going to fuck this up. #sakout"
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,ethic_,7,Wed Jul 15 03:37:04 2015 UTC,yup and pessimistic fans will always be pessimistic...its that kind of support that will really make a Union USL Team a thriving success...thanks.
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,MrChips217,-7,Wed Jul 15 03:39:46 2015 UTC,"You delusional fans will be delusional, you are the kind of fan that will make the new team a ""success""."
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,ethic_,5,Wed Jul 15 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"Trust me I am far from delusional when it comes to this team. I know the struggles, I understand the frustrations, I followed them from the beginning and have seen it all. From your stance you would rather have players sit on our bench from 18-??? and have us pay them to do nothing but practice, which makes absolutely no sense and leads me to believe you either know absolutely nothing about soccer or you are currently high on PCP.   You are the kind of fan that will only be happy if we sign an enormous name well guess what I would rather our team develop a USL Team and invest in players that they can later flip for profit or actually crack the starting 11 then sign a 34 year old for 4.5 million dollars just to watch him play 1-2 years and retire. So I guess you're right about me being delusional...but I know you're right that I will be rooting for the Union USL Team just as hard as the Union MLS Team to make sure they are a ""success""."
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,MrChips217,0,Wed Jul 15 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"I don't want Kaka, I want the team to spend something on a player in his prime, that is not constantly hurt Colombian. Why with our TV market, and our support do we not have just one player we can put on billboard or market or make us excited. I really just want the owners of the team to show commitment to us by saying I know you will support us and now you have that one extra reason to show your friends why we are more interesting then the birds. No they will hold on to the team until the have build I great system, with second levels teams and all, and sell. Because they are not in to win. They are in it for the money. They should name the team U2."
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,ethic_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:47 2015 UTC,"Well I want to work for Google making Doodles with My Poodle but what we want and what we get are two different things. The Union obviously don't have enough money for Giovinco or Dos Santos and yes the ownership are in it for the money...but like it or not the Union are a BUSINESS just like every team in the league, its been made clear by the owners that they are far more interested in developing their youth then getting a big name. If you really hate the FO that much then you would want the team to build a great system, have a second team, and Sell...that would bring the change to the FO you are so adamantly calling for ,so, again you should 100% want a USL Union Team."
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,MrChips217,4,Wed Jul 15 04:14:33 2015 UTC,What!?!? This would be the most important thing the Union have ever done outside of actually becoming an MLS team in the first place.
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,Dean_Moriarty,0,Tue Jul 14 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"Which has gotten Philly what, one playoff run. Mismanaged teams are mismanaged, no matter what the level."
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,ethic_,2,Wed Jul 15 03:22:36 2015 UTC,You comment doesn't make sense as a reply to my comment.
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,Dean_Moriarty,0,Wed Jul 15 03:26:42 2015 UTC,It is in to response to what the most important thing the union has ever done.
PhillyUnion,3db9j5,ethic_,2,Wed Jul 15 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"Still doesn't make sense, you seem to be arguing that adding a USL team to develop young players is a bad idea because the Union haven't been successful on the field previously.  If anything, that would be something in favor of adding a USL team.  Being able to develop your own talent would be absolutely massive. The Union have the academy right now, but that ends when the high school ends, when most players are 18.    Most players are not ready for professional first team minutes at that age.  So all these academy players are going to college where the development sucks and the Union can't control anything.  If we add a USL team that would bridge the gap between the Academy and the Union.    And even more so in a salary cap league the MLS you need to develop your own talent, a USL would be key to that."

PhillyUnion,3dc0as,MacGooder,3,Wed Jul 15 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"Like most said, he had flashes of brilliance, but he also had terrible stretches. One thing that I think is often forgot was that he had an absolutely terrible supporting cast. For quite some time, he had Pajoy, Josue Martinez, and Jack Mac on the end of his passes. An underwhelming group of strikers will make any CAM look bad.  Opta rated Freddy as having the most clear cut chances in MLS in 2012 (whatever the hell that means). On a team with someone like Sapong, he would have had double digit assists. It didn't help that Hackworth played him on the wing due to his fascination with the idea that Marfan was a CAM (a terrible player, but I digress).  Was he worth the money? No. Was he as bad as everyone says? No. A shitty surrounding cast, a bad attitude, a manager who hated him, and a bloated salary were the main reasons he failed here."
PhillyUnion,3dc0as,FlapjackJackson,3,Wed Jul 15 13:48:18 2015 UTC,He had flashes of brilliance but was never happy in his best role as a playmaker
PhillyUnion,3dc0as,midwesternhousewives,2,Wed Jul 15 06:24:46 2015 UTC,"He was great at times. At times he was lazy and not great. He had major attitude problems and a reputation for womanizing, allegedly with prostitutes. Overall there was a lot of hype he didn't live up to. He was/is a decent player, but he was drama and massively overrated when he was on the Union. Plus he didn't exactly go out of his way to make it easy to transfer him."
PhillyUnion,3dc0as,KFCConspiracy,5,Wed Jul 15 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"I mean, the transfer was all on Hack. Freddy seemed open to moving, but Hack did a terrible job mishandling the situation by benching him and showing his hand about the transfer. It's like Rais now. The player was willing to peace, but the F.O. is too incompetent to move him."
PhillyUnion,3dc0as,FlapjackJackson,2,Wed Jul 15 13:50:29 2015 UTC,He could have been great if literally every facet of this team wasn't a festering abomination.
PhillyUnion,3dc0as,Demopublican,2,Thu Jul 16 03:03:03 2015 UTC,he was the only creative attacking player we had.  he carried the team for a while and then fell off towards the end of the season when he most likely became severely depressed at constantly taking on the entire defense and sending perfect balls to Leonard Pajoy only to have them sent as far wide as possible and enduring Hackworth's sick and twisted plan to play him out of position for weeks then randomly put him at CAM where he would have a great game only to get put on the wing again the next week.

He was inconsistent, and every time something good happened he would get stifled by some bad luck. Examples being a bogus red card against the Red Bulls after a fantastic half and getting injured on a penalty kick against the Dynamo if I remember correctly."

You can't expect a 34 year old to beat a 24 year old defender not that he was necessarily fast to begin with. Casey is a good bench option but we need more depth at ST.   Le Toux is just plain out of form and that coupled with his age doesn't exactly scream play maker. The club should keep him for his leadership and presence around for as long as possible as he has top notch fan interactions and anybody who was at his welcome back party at Kildare's will agree...he loves this fucking city.

PhillyUnion,3cyvis,LocksTheFox,10,Sun Jul 12 01:01:57 2015 UTC,This was my first MLS game (i live in Michigan). I was proud to support the union in river's end.   Glad to be part of such a huge win!

PhillyUnion,3cyvis,ignoramis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"After he scored, when he wipes his head he is totally thinking ""Holy fuck finally thank god."""
PhillyUnion,3cyvis,elreeso55,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"Just think a week ago that ball would have hit the far post, hit the back of the goalie hit the crossbar, go back to the goalie, then probably fly off into the river hitting the top cross bar again."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,Incara1010,19,Sun Jul 12 00:59:45 2015 UTC,"The interplay between Maidana and Nogs was amazing tonight. Now we can cross our fingers that Wenger can show that type of clinical finishing more often.  Really disappointed in the ref though for the yellow to Mo, and honestly from the replays it looked like Seba got his foot on the ball before Valeri there as well."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,bc122,12,Sun Jul 12 01:02:44 2015 UTC,I swear every game I have given tickets away too they have dominated and just looked good.  I need to buy a full season ticket and give em all away

PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,drewuke,5,Sun Jul 12 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, they showed a lot of confidence. But a lot of it was capitalizing on Portland's hesitations."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,LocksTheFox,3,Sun Jul 12 01:06:37 2015 UTC,a good team is able to exploit the opponent's fuckups.
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,everydayasOrenG,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:31:58 2015 UTC,they showed a lot of confidence.   +1

PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,_axaxaxax,5,Sun Jul 12 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"He did some good stuff tonight, felt like we were seeing the union they always could have been."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,MarkMagowan,6,Sun Jul 12 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"The replay was amazing, it just swerved through defenders. The luck was with him tonight. On other nights he might have skied that."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:07:48 2015 UTC,"My view of it was almost directly behind the midfield camera (the replay shown) and let me tell you, once he made that last touch with his right foot to cut left, that opening was W I I I D E open to take that shot. Borchers was closing on him, but that only forced him to really put it on frame."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,JoeWearsSocks,7,Mon Jul 13 06:43:32 2015 UTC,"Maidana, according to MLS, had three apples tonight, putting him into a tie for second in MLS after only Ethan Finlay."

PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,Dean_Moriarty,9,Sun Jul 12 03:02:20 2015 UTC,Best performance from Sylvestre since joining the U. All around great. Just what we needed.
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,spqr-king,6,Sun Jul 12 01:05:42 2015 UTC,He's been a real season savior.
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:08:38 2015 UTC,"I dont know I feel like our backline got a lot stronger around the time he got here. He has a lot of skill dont get me wrong but we have really limited shots on goal since having Marquez, Edu, and Carroll in the lineup consistently. I wonder what happens if MacMath comes back..."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,yung_swagged_out_mf,2,Sun Jul 12 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"At this point I don't even know if I'd want MacMath back because of the potential drama it would cause. I feel like we should just put it behind us and move on. Sylvestre has been solid, so why fix what's not broken? We tried that already and look where it got us."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,jpoRS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:52:27 2015 UTC,they've sort of fucked over a promising career for the moment and you gotta think he wanted to leave in the first place or else they wouldn't really have a reason to not keep him as a backup.  I don't see him coming back
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,SuperSans,2,Sun Jul 12 19:33:07 2015 UTC,I really hope they find a way to keep him.

PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,AngryHugo,5,Sun Jul 12 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"Hope to see Maidana keep up this brilliant streak. He's been playing great all season and I think tonight all the right pieces have seemed to fall into place. Was a bit worried after a scoreless first half, considering that the Timber's starting keeper has had eleven starts in ten years. But way to go Union, still not completely on board the Wenger train even though he showed he could play offensively tonight and not as some mindless winger. He still has a lot to convince me why his starts are more valuable than Ayuk's, who has more goals than him this season, is only 18 and has room to grow. Plus that speed.  Good win for Philly, glad to have more points than NYCFC, and one point shy of a playoff spot. Who knows, maybe this is the year we break through the regular season after 3 somewhat miserable campaigns."
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,everydayasOrenG,3,Sun Jul 12 01:07:52 2015 UTC,Chaco has been great.  His fitness is way up from last season.  He's now getting balls he'd never track down last year.
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:50:20 2015 UTC,Plus that speed.   is Ayuk faster than Wenger?

PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,mtommyboy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:08:59 2015 UTC,It wasn't too bad. The extended player interviews were cool.
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,Mike81890,2,Sun Jul 12 02:03:45 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it a lot. Could be a good first step in expanding the Union's media coverage.
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,mtommyboy,4,Sun Jul 12 02:05:26 2015 UTC,Curtin just had a great quote in the press conference about fans being warranted to boo when things are bad and that's just part of pro sports. And also that when things go well the players will get the cheering and support of everyone. I love his candor as always with the media!
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sun Jul 12 01:34:27 2015 UTC,Link?
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,spqr-king,2,Sun Jul 12 18:37:05 2015 UTC,Union have a video of the post game presser on their YouTube channel. On mobile so I can't get it at the moment
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,NaranjaEclipse,2,Mon Jul 13 02:29:33 2015 UTC,"For sake of argument, assume Vitoria is 90' fit.  Who do you pair with Marquez, White or Vitoria?"
PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,Mountainhawk98,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:07:24 2015 UTC,Knowing Curtin whoever does well in practice will start. Vitoria seems to be the future unless we wont extend his loan so thats where my money is.

PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,jpoRS,3,Sun Jul 12 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"Depends where you parked. The official Union lots should only be $20, but there are a bunch of other unofficial lots near the stadium as well."

PhillyUnion,3cyvb2,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:49:21 2015 UTC,Amazing game to attend I gotta say probably a top 5 for me and I have been to some really really special games for not having season tickets. The team and stadium was electric and the Sons of Ben tailgate was really really fun. This team is a roller coaster of emotion at this point and I am down for the ride.
PhillyUnion,3cytci,ignoramis,6,Sun Jul 12 00:40:09 2015 UTC,"I was wondering what his goal celebration was about, looked like he was eating cereal.  Was he saying he was hungry for a goal? Telling fans to eat their words? Advocating to be on the cover of a Wheaties box?"
PhillyUnion,3cytci,Dean_Moriarty,6,Sun Jul 12 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"That's the ""I'm hungry for more"" and/or ""feed the beast"" celebration I'm pretty sure"
PhillyUnion,3cytci,hmpsnj,5,Sun Jul 12 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"I hope he is hungry. I'm not feeling too bad about calling for the benching of a single goal scorer... By all means, I hope he shuts me up hard."
PhillyUnion,3cytci,keystonemike,2,Sun Jul 12 03:37:49 2015 UTC,I've been telling my friends that I think Wenger might just need 1 goal to get the confidence to score more goals. But I don't know that I would leave him in the lineup to let him get it. Curtin chose to so I'm hoping it works out and he begins a scoring spree.
PhillyUnion,3cytci,_asper,2,Sun Jul 12 05:19:34 2015 UTC,Hopefully seeing the ball hit the back of the net gets him on a hot streak. I wanted to see him benched too
PhillyUnion,3cytci,hmpsnj,5,Sun Jul 12 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"Musselman's Applesauce, surely."
PhillyUnion,3cytci,EdBacon,2,Sun Jul 12 03:35:16 2015 UTC,I just noticed that for the first time at the game. I guess I don't actually look at the menus when I go but I just noticed that every thing said with fries or applesauce and thought how bizarre that was
PhillyUnion,3cytci,ronaldo119,3,Sun Jul 12 11:26:56 2015 UTC,I thought he was recording?
PhillyUnion,3cytci,midwesternhousewives,2,Sun Jul 12 01:24:28 2015 UTC,"for as bad as he was playing, he was still taking on defenders and getting the ball into the box.  he was just making terrible decisions or bad passes/shots once he got there.  this is why you bench someone, it obviously got it into his head that he needs to play better and he came out yesterday and did just that"
PhillyUnion,3cytci,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:24:12 2015 UTC,Still not convinced with his overall performance.  Seemed quite lazy defensively at times in the game. But I'm glad he got on the score sheet.
PhillyUnion,3cypng,MorphineSmile,3,Sun Jul 12 00:02:50 2015 UTC,"The 2008 financial crisis was definitely a factor. Before the crash, Jay Sugarman's iStar stock was around $50/share. Today it sits around $2."
PhillyUnion,3cypng,ebradlee10,5,Sun Jul 12 11:32:43 2015 UTC,Friday's (7/10/15) closing price was $13.50 - no idea where the $2 today stuff comes from - not correct.  Here's a link: https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=STAR At the depths of the credit crisis (roughly early 2009) the price was under a $1.  The stock price has gradually recovered over the years much like most of the financial sector companies that survived.  The market currently values the company at approximately $1.16 billion.  Insiders (of which Jay Sugarman would be since he's the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors) hold approximately 8% ownership according to Yahoo Finance.

PhillyUnion,3cyfy9,dragonjock27,2,Sun Jul 12 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"I think a club here could do very well. The AO Lancaster chapter is large and if the viewing parties for US games over the last couple years are any indication, the sport is alive and well here and will be very well supported. As a fellow Lancasterian, I agree. It would be AWESOME to have a club of our own."
PhillyUnion,3cyfy9,goatyhead,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:34:59 2015 UTC,Idk if you were at the islanders vs crystal palace game a few years ago but clipper stadium was packed
PhillyUnion,3cyfy9,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:29:27 2015 UTC,Soccer in general has been huge in this area for as long as I've lived here. The AO chapter has indeed been really successful as far as I can tell. Their viewing parties for the Men's World cup were outstanding for attendance and atmosphere. I didn't get to any of the Women's parties but I'd be surprised if they were any different.  Pipedream time: Another stadium is added in that general area (there is some open space for sure) and we end up with the ideal city based team experience because there are actually things to do before/after within walking distance.
PhillyUnion,3cyfy9,enlightenedego,2,Mon Jul 13 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"i've seen rumors that its just announcing two friendly games that will be played at the stadium in august. I've seen that harrisburg might be relocating either short term or long term to lancaster. and I've seen that maybe the union are putting their USL team in lancaster (this one I don't believe at all, because why would the islanders be there, and why wouldn't this be a bigger deal.)   all of this is just facebook talk between people that communicate with the Islanders FO. Personally I think they are going to have a friendly between the two team in clipper stadium. Maybe union is testing the water for the USL team though?"

PhillyUnion,3cwzqw,khyleth,2,Sat Jul 11 22:21:55 2015 UTC,For real. I'd do at least half of our starting lineup...and more than one of our subs.

The ""club"" somehow could not afford his measly transfer fee, so instead they extended his loan to save face.  Don't get it twisted, this is not good news. This is more of the same.  NYCFC just spent 8 or 9 mil to sign Pirlo. But we can not afford a few hundred thousand to buy Aristigueta. This is fucking pathetic.  Fuck you Sak. Fuck you Sugarman.

PhillyUnion,3cglg2,phancypheetz,12,Tue Jul 7 22:49:04 2015 UTC,"As annoyed as you are, you aren't seeing that this makes a lot of sense. He hasn't shown enough to buy him out, due to injury. By loaning him for the rest of the year you give him time to show that he's worth it to hold onto long term. All I've seen from Fernando is that he's highly injury prone, hasn't adapted well to the physicality of mls, and that he's really slow. I love the move. Make him prove his worth."
PhillyUnion,3cglg2,kyleisgreattt,2,Wed Jul 8 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"That's not their motivation. It was public knowledge that we were trying to work out a permanent deal for the player. That fell through due to not being able to afford the asking price of the selling club, which was not high at all.  If we went in with the money, halted the dela ourselves and said ""let's wait to see how this plays out due to injury concerns first"" that would be one thing, and I would completely get that. But that's not what happened. We approached them with intentions to buy, and could not afford to do so. Don't really feel like going back a month through my twitter feed to find it, but all the union journos were tweeting about how we were trying to purchase the player. It may have even been dropped by staff members in interviews, I don't really remember, but we were trying to buy him.  Then all of the sudden this happens? Cmon man, this is not the union all of the sudden playing it safe/smart. They can't afford the guy."
PhillyUnion,3cglg2,phancypheetz,3,Wed Jul 8 00:26:52 2015 UTC,"Whether they intended to or not, extending the loan is the right thing to do. Way too small a sample size to know whether this guy is worth an outright purchase. They'll probably have more cap space at season's end too (I hope)."
PhillyUnion,3cglg2,keystone_union,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to feel. Fernando could work if we had the right players on the field behind him, but as disjointed as the Union are he just hasn't been productive at all. He can't create his own chances, he's slow, and he requires good service which the team can't provide. He's sorta being set up to fail. I just don't see the point in keeping him if you're not going to provide the necessary support, or don't have a plan on how he's going to be utilized. Players aren't just interchangeable names on a roster like they could be in MLS 1.0 which is firmly where the Union seem to be rooted."
PhillyUnion,3cglg2,EdBacon,5,Wed Jul 8 15:02:21 2015 UTC,Honestly this works out for us so we can see how injury prone he really is I would be nervous spending a good amount of money on a player who has been injured most of the time he has been here same with Vitoria. Then again we dont have money for ANYONE so I agree with everything you said.
PhillyUnion,3cglg2,spqr-king,2,Wed Jul 8 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"I hear what you are saying, but this isn't the team being cautious to make sure it's a good investment. They straight up can't afford the transfer fee."

And the Allentown/Lehigh Valley area is an area we're looking at as well as others. The whole sport, in general, is growing and expanding.""  Sakiewicz knows the Lehigh Valley and said the Union partnered with ArtsQuest to host viewing parties at SteelStacks for the World Cup matches, both this year and last year.  ""We hope to be making more noise in the Lehigh Valley, positive noise, in the months to come,"" he said.   I don't know how much to look into these quotes.  Looks like an Allentown newspaper decided to do an interest piece on PPL Park and Sak was just playing up to the audience.   He basically even says so:   Meanwhile, Sakiewicz and the Union want more sports fans from the Lehigh Valley, and from around the region, to give his place a look.   Hope it's more than just posturing, and more then just maybe someday it would be cool, and that they are actually seriously looking to launch a second team soon.    But how true it is or not, that's the kind of thing we want Sak to be doing. To be expanding the brand and seeking business partners and all that good stuff, so I'm not necessarily criticizing him here."

PhillyUnion,3c0h9p,peewoah1,2,Sat Jul 4 00:44:51 2015 UTC,What upside? He was a one-trick pony who never improved.
PhillyUnion,3c0h9p,FlapjackJackson,2,Sat Jul 4 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, he's gotten way worse since his first season."
PhillyUnion,3c0h9p,drewuke,2,Sat Jul 4 14:05:10 2015 UTC,The Ribiero-Effect
PhillyUnion,3c0h9p,Timothy-H,2,Sat Jul 4 17:25:26 2015 UTC,Being kept around so Union Hulk yells at someone other than Sak/Sugarman probably.
PhillyUnion,3c0h9p,Coratus,2,Sat Jul 4 12:15:43 2015 UTC,I used to like him. Then he kept diving and I lost respect for him
PhillyUnion,3c0h9p,midwesternhousewives,2,Sat Jul 4 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"had a pretty good week, and my KHL team are finally bringing up some of our youth which makes me feel fuzzy inside."
PhillyUnion,3c0h9p,funkyquasar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:57:36 2015 UTC,Are there any outdoor screenings of the WWC Final today?
PhillyUnion,3bzcdu,Pornonation,7,Fri Jul 3 11:05:11 2015 UTC,We do in the sense that Sugar and Sak are double-penetrating our assholes.
PhillyUnion,3bzcdu,chrisronald67,2,Sun Jul 5 00:15:02 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that there's a limited amount of allocation to cut DPs to Core Players. The Union could use that allocation to drop any of their DPS to Core Players but it's not clear to me if there is enough to drop all three. From what I understand the majority of DPs in the league would be eligible to become Core Players. Again the way I understand it, it seems to only serve a purpose if you are bringing in a fourth DP, or at least actively considering doing so.   So based on what I got, every DP in the league besides Dempsey, Oba, Gilberto, Bradley, Keane, Omar, Pedro Morales, Liam Ridgewell,Villa, Kaka, Jones and probably Lampard, Gerrard, Pirlo, Altidore, Giovinco, and Cubo (they're salaries aren't on Wikipedia) are eligible to become core players.   There's 15 other DPS that don't have listed salaries so I just guessed on those. Beckerman, Kevin Doyle and Shaun Maloney are the only others who might even be at 750k. Everyone else is almost definitely under, and a lot of them could presumably be paid down."
PhillyUnion,3bzcdu,bmangan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"Edu, and I think Aristeguieta still counts as a Young DP.   And technically M'Bolhi."
PhillyUnion,3bzcdu,jpoRS,2,Fri Jul 3 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"Edu's salary last year (650k) was in the core player range, but they might have to pay some amount of allocation to get him down to 750k now. Chaco is definitely not a DP anymore, Mbolhi is a core player, but hopefully that's irrelevant and he's gone soon."
PhillyUnion,3bzcdu,emptythecache,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:35:53 2015 UTC,How much is Nando earning?
PhillyUnion,3bzcdu,m4nu,6,Fri Jul 3 13:46:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but as a young DP, he has a decreased cap hit (i think 200k?)"
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,LocksTheFox,6,Fri Jul 3 01:51:28 2015 UTC,Oh jeez this is pretty exciting. He sounds like another Chaco. If we had 2 Chacos... We would almost be a real team.    Gonchaco - Aristeguieta - Sapong  Chaco  Nogueira - Edu   Sheanon - Marquez - Vitoria/White/Someone-Else - Gaddis   That's a pretty good team
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,Mike81890,6,Fri Jul 3 14:35:00 2015 UTC,Yet another 6 month loan...
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,OshiHidra,4,Fri Jul 3 02:34:17 2015 UTC,Loans for the second half of the season aren't too rare.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,keystone_union,5,Fri Jul 3 03:41:36 2015 UTC,Maybe with an option to purchase? I think it's an MLS requirement anyway.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Fri Jul 3 03:57:35 2015 UTC,All reports say MLS loans must have a option to buy.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,jpoRS,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:55:19 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Actually a really good idea for the league to institute.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,--smokeandmirrors--,4,Fri Jul 3 20:58:53 2015 UTC,"27 year old midfielder at Boca, formerly of Villarreal. Transfermarkt has him listed as a #10 who can also play either wing.  Pachuca and Newell's also in on him."
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,Too_many_hippos,4,Fri Jul 3 01:54:19 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: He's only available for Transfer, so we need to say M'Barrassing first."
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,peewoah1,3,Sat Jul 4 00:57:57 2015 UTC,Do we actually have any money to spend on someone like him?
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:11:28 2015 UTC,Nope. Spent it all on M'Bolhi ❤. Don't have any money until he's off the books.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,peewoah1,2,Fri Jul 3 03:26:29 2015 UTC,We just resigned Aristeguieta while M'Bohli is still on the payroll.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Jul 3 10:36:54 2015 UTC,"I've heard it's a loan extention for the rest of the season, and not a true signing."
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,rutvij_dave,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:50:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you were implying we were on personnel lock down until M'Bohli is sold, but we just paid to keep Fernando (whether for the rest of the season or longterm) so it stands to reason we could get someone else on loan without first having to sell Rais (though I hope that happens soon regardless)."
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:56:27 2015 UTC,Do loan extensions require a fee?
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,bmangan,2,Sun Jul 5 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"Highlights  What I wrote on Big Soccer:  He seems to have great vision and plays some beautiful balls. I'm impressed as well with his close control with the ball and ability to beat defenders. His defensive work is impressive as well. Unfortunately, his shooting seems to suck.  Playing him in the center with Maidana out wide might result in a nice possession game. Probably not with this coaching."
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,FlapjackJackson,3,Fri Jul 3 04:46:52 2015 UTC,"Good passer, good dribbler but terrible shot? Sounds like he'll fit in perfectly with Maidana and Noguiera."
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,bmangan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:22:18 2015 UTC,He looks better thsn Chaco.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,FlapjackJackson,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:05 2015 UTC,I only watched a minute or so of the highlights and he definitely looks more athletic than Chaco at the very least.
PhillyUnion,3bxx26,jpoRS,0,Fri Jul 3 14:04:45 2015 UTC,Better passes as well
PhillyUnion,3bvc2d,Mountainhawk98,9,Thu Jul 2 13:22:34 2015 UTC,Hopefully a good sign that they aren't going to screw the Union over for a Chelsea friendly.
PhillyUnion,3bvc2d,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Thu Jul 2 13:23:02 2015 UTC,I mean I get that the USSF gets a share of friendly profits but scheduling a cup tournament around them is kind of absurd.
PhillyUnion,3bvc2d,jd158ug,3,Thu Jul 2 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"They can do it the day of the All-Star game, July 29. NYRB are not playing the weekend before, while we are in DC on Sunday - so playing on Tues 28th would be a short turnaround for us. Interestingly, the weekend after, RB come to PPL."
PhillyUnion,3bvc2d,jd158ug,2,Thu Jul 2 17:48:51 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why the Union should have to move it from July 21-22.  The dates of the US Open Cup were published well in advance of the ICC friendlies being scheduled.
PhillyUnion,3bvc2d,Mike81890,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, it's a concession to Chelsea. I guess I'm just relieved it wasn't moved to 15th as originally suggested."
PhillyUnion,3bvc2d,IPv6_and_BASS,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"It's a concession to NYRB, not Chelsea.  Chelsea doesn't care less if they have to play NYRB II players --- it's a training match for them.  Moving it just allows NYRB to host the game at RBA instead of surrendering hosting rights or spending money on an alternate venue like they should have to do for booking 2 friendlies at RBA -- one on EACH day of the quarterfinals."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,xenoletum,11,Wed Jul 1 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"Talen Energy   Dang, was hoping for a return of an FU Center."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,Dean_Moriarty,9,Wed Jul 1 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"So I guess my dream that we would all start calling it the ""Stadium of Power and Light"" is shot."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,jpoRS,3,Wed Jul 1 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"Haha oh man. I remember educating myself on European soccer and just being so perplexed that ""The Stadium of Light"" was the official title to a venue."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,MarkMagowan,6,Thu Jul 2 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"Someone in the comments of that article suggested naming it ""Talen Bridge"" I kind of like the ring to that but then everyone would think that is the name of the actual Commodore Barry Bridge."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,FatboyAFC,6,Wed Jul 1 22:15:55 2015 UTC,We need to bomb the Unions twitter and facebook with that name Talen Bridge sounds awesome.
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,spqr-king,3,Thu Jul 2 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"And then you can just call it the Bridge. So when they change the name again in 5 years, it won't matter."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,keystonemike,2,Thu Jul 2 03:22:46 2015 UTC,Because of Stamford Bridge?
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,thelostdolphin,3,Thu Jul 2 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, plus the actual bridge there helps."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,FatboyAFC,7,Thu Jul 2 17:00:56 2015 UTC,"If that doesn't stick, there's always Prettygoodison Park or New Trafford."
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,thelostdolphin,4,Thu Jul 2 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"I do like Talen Bridge, but we'd have to send word to Talen Energy/PPL/Whatever in order to get any movement there."

PhillyUnion,3brkfp,zb313,2,Thu Jul 2 05:03:59 2015 UTC,How do you pronounce Talen? Tay-len or Tal-en?
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,porkchameleon,3,Thu Jul 2 02:28:30 2015 UTC,Tale-n.
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,MarkMagowan,2,Thu Jul 2 03:36:09 2015 UTC,Talon
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Jul 2 04:59:50 2015 UTC,Like it would be pronounced in this sentence: Do the chickens have large talons?
PhillyUnion,3brkfp,womlypajay,2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"Kinda sad to see the original name go, that's a part of the club history. If it's pronounced like Talon i plan on calling it The Coop, because the chickens have large talons."
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,Mountainhawk98,15,Wed Jul 1 13:35:42 2015 UTC,So we have to cancel our money making friendly so NYRB can have their money making friendly.
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,TaeKurmulti,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"AFC Bournemouth is not a money making friendly, it's a game that no one besides season ticket holders will even show up for.  Bournemouth doesn't even have any fans in the US.    Remember when we had teams that you actually recognize come play us?  Good times.  2010 - Man United, Celtic, CD Guadalajara  2011 - Real Madrid, Everton 2012 - Schalke 04, Aston Villa  2013 - Stoke City, Pumas UNAM 2014 - Crystal Palace 2015 - AFC Bournemouth  Just like almost everything the loser Nick Sak runs this shit has become a joke.  Next year we'll be lucky to get fucking Millwall to come play here, maybe if we're lucky Nick will bring us Leeds United!"
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,Mike81890,9,Sun Jul 5 07:49:13 2015 UTC,I feel like this can't stand... seems pretty preposterous. Did USSF maybe not know we had a friendly scheduled because we scheduled it so late?
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,starcom_magnate,6,Wed Jul 1 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they did. But when you look at Chelsea or Bournemouth and Red Bull or Union, the answer was pretty clear in their eyes.  Still sucks, though."
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,IPv6_and_BASS,2,Wed Jul 1 17:13:06 2015 UTC,"Which to me is kind of a crap reason, because I'm pretty sure I've seen statistics for this season where Union attendance by percentage is higher than RBNY for league + non-league games."
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,spqr-king,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:39:39 2015 UTC,Not to mention the Red Bulls would get absolutely shit on by Chelsea's first team whereas this is Bournemouth's first jump into the PL. Our match would probably be much better to watch.
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,gregzorian,4,Thu Jul 2 01:43:49 2015 UTC,Huge load of shit. And nobody at MLSsoccer.com will cover this.
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,--smokeandmirrors--,7,Wed Jul 1 19:42:53 2015 UTC,What a joke.   But I guess I shouldn't be surprised the federation and mls only really care about the New York teams and the Galaxy
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,IPv6_and_BASS,2,Wed Jul 1 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"I understand that Chels v RBNY is a more high profile game, but how did they earn the reschedule? Is it something that maybe our FO can negotiate? Or our supporters could complain about en masse via social media to force their hand?   I know it really won't matter until after their USOC game tonight, but I'd really like to find a way to fight this."
PhillyUnion,3br1zp,IPv6_and_BASS,3,Wed Jul 1 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"If NYRB wins tonight, I would suggest bombarding @opencup and @ussoccer wiht protest messages.  Maybe pick a hashtag to use."

PhillyUnion,3brbc3,Mountainhawk98,3,Thu Jul 2 12:27:29 2015 UTC,This is the only reasonable explanation left IMO.  Is there some kind of voodoo exorcism ceremony the SoB can perform pre game in our next home game?

PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,m4nu,4,Wed Jul 1 05:41:10 2015 UTC,My reaction exactly. We havent seen a lot from him in terms of scoring other then off set pieces if I remember correctly. He has been injured a bit to much and Sapong is on fire. He is great for depth but I dont think he will want to be a bench player or swap in and out with CJ who needs to stay up top to perform. I like the guy but its all in the price and where to put him.
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,spqr-king,6,Wed Jul 1 11:01:07 2015 UTC,"We need to upgrade our midfield and figure out a way to play a 4-4-2 so it's not an either/or with those two guys, imo."
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,thelostdolphin,2,Wed Jul 1 13:41:11 2015 UTC,"Well I think having one of them as a sub would be amazing because they are both skilled and depth is always a good thing but I agree something like   Gaddis-Edu-Marquez-Fabinho  LeToux-Carroll-Nogs-Ayuk     Fernando-Sapong   Then in reserves we have Pfeffer, Williams, Wenger I mean thats not a bad bench or interchangeable players. Swap in Pfeffer for Carroll and you have a better attack. I can see it working well."
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,spqr-king,3,Wed Jul 1 14:01:18 2015 UTC,"No Maidana? Also, Nogueira has never had much success playing as a 10. He needs someone like Maidana playing in front of him."
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:15:56 2015 UTC,Like I said a lot of these guys are interchangeable other than the top two and maybe thats why we have not adopted this formation because if say Sapong needed to be subbed out mid match due to injury who would replace him? Honestly Maidana has been in good form dont know why I didnt put him in there but the point remains we would have depth.
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,spqr-king,2,Wed Jul 1 15:36:48 2015 UTC,Look at it this way: Sapong will be banned for 3 games and we have NO ONE else
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,Mike81890,3,Wed Jul 1 14:12:20 2015 UTC,Three? For his red card last night shouldnt it be one match if they dont challenge it because that card was horse shit.
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,spqr-king,7,Wed Jul 1 14:15:15 2015 UTC,I want to see us run a two striker formation again. I love Nando but he became extremely ineffective despite his effort in the later games that he played.
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,zb313,4,Wed Jul 1 11:55:05 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Maidana had a few month stretch where he could barely play 90. He's looked fitter than ever. I wouldn't worry about fitness with Jim at the helm. He may not have much, but he seems to be a drill sergeant"
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,Mike81890,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:15:24 2015 UTC,He had ZERO service during that time.
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,keystonemike,3,Thu Jul 2 03:26:43 2015 UTC,Unless they pair him with Sapong I don't really know that this is a good fit. Sapong is too hot to bench if we're going to keep playing 4-5-1
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,thanksbastards,2,Wed Jul 1 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know. With what I've seen so far of Aristeguieta, his contribution absolutely can't hurt. I'd say give him chances, even if that means taking him off the bench at 60 minutes."
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,marble617,2,Wed Jul 1 05:48:06 2015 UTC,At this point signing ANY good player is a good move. We just played 5 games in 15 days and only rotated the keepers and Pfeffer.  CJ can drop into Chaco's role with Aristeguieta up top or Aristeguieta can come off the bench. They'll make something work.
PhillyUnion,3bpgu8,Mike81890,0,Wed Jul 1 14:14:10 2015 UTC,Not entirely. Why should we give a bench player a DP contract? It's poor utilization of our resources.

If not, let him go, wish him all the best. Use the money saved to add some depth throughout the roster. Also, sign Sebastian Elney(He'll be cheap, and not on the salary cap)!

PhillyUnion,3bpec1,Timothy-H,12,Wed Jul 1 02:12:23 2015 UTC,That was weird. Is it possible to appeal a red in the OC?
PhillyUnion,3bpec1,LocksTheFox,5,Wed Jul 1 02:24:13 2015 UTC,I'm wondering this too. There is no way that was a red.

PhillyUnion,3bpec1,akuller,8,Wed Jul 1 03:19:58 2015 UTC,No complaints. Shitty circumstances and they arose to the occasion. That was also a fantastic sub so big props to Curtin.  I hope they don't fuck up with Ayuk. Kid has a good chance to be really really good and an integral part of this team for the future.
PhillyUnion,3bpec1,--smokeandmirrors--,8,Wed Jul 1 02:30:04 2015 UTC,All I could think during the second half was please just let Ayuk develop and keep a hold of him. He clearly gives it all for the team. He got beat up the second half and just collapsed when the final whistle blew. Great to watch and I hope we see more of the passion.
PhillyUnion,3bpec1,Incara1010,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:00:26 2015 UTC,"Well, he got reamed out by Curtin last week for not taking the ball into the corner and protecting the lead. Yesterday, he came out and played a heady game. Dribbled when appropriate, passed the ball better, and got absolutely beat up (as you said) to hold onto that lead. That shows improvement (and hopefully good coaching)."
PhillyUnion,3bpec1,keystonemike,9,Thu Jul 2 03:14:34 2015 UTC,I honestly forgot we only had 10 men until someone brought it up after Fabi scored.  That's how hard they played.  That's how bad they want this cup.

PhillyUnion,3bpec1,crylicylon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:21:13 2015 UTC,"It was a soft yellow at best. His elbow was out, but there was minimal contact. Plus, the same situation happened later to Fabinho and there was no card. No consistency from the ref."

PhillyUnion,3bofbs,samatwing,8,Tue Jun 30 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Well, it's all complicated.  Poverty: Sugarman bought this team in '07 or '08 right before the recession. Since his wealth comes from real estate, he lost a ton of money, and we did not have the money to invest in this team. He's recovered from the recession, but he is still not spending money. Many of us assume he is sitting on the team to flip for a profit down the road. When he bought the team, his expansion fee was $30 million. Now, teams pay $100 million for an expansion fee.  Big name players: It's bigger than the players. We have no GM, a coaching staff of 4 people, a lack of a nutritional structure and team provided meals, no real training facility, shitty weight room, no full-time scouts, and a general lack of a plan or direction. Signing someone like Gerrard would not change this.  Youth: This is on thing I wanted to add. The team always talks about their investment in the youth system. However, the investment all comes from a minority owner (Ritche Graham) and not Sugarman. Also, the use of our youth is laughably bad. In 5.5 years, Pfeffer is the only homegrown to receive real minutes. It took him over 5 years to consistently see the field. McLaughlin still can't see the field and Hernandez peaced out and left the team. Despite the team singing the praises of youth, they never sign youth, have no plan for integrating the youth, and don't even have a proper affiliate to play their youth like other teams.  Welcome aboard, and enjoy the dumpster fire."

They will say we don't have the resources to make big name player acquisitions, but then spend $1m+ on a GK, when we already had two bright young prospects one which had 100+ MLS starts. They will say that they understand our frustrations, but then say our protests are 'ill-thought off'. They will say they are spending money on youth development when we haven't had a Home Grown Player signing in 3 years(I might be slightly off on the exact time)"

One, it's a trophy - a playoff run gets logged in Wikipedia and that's done. Two, it gives the club their first honor and provides us with a great foundation to build upon. The confidence that those young players will get from being part of a trophy-winning team will be huge. Three, CCL will give us more exposure which could lead to good (financial) things.   It's also probably the easier route for a team that is inconsistent at best. A few wins (lucky or not) and we're in a semi or even final. Generally, playoff teams are teams that really deserve to be there through consistent point-earning. I don't think that is us right now."

As others have mentioned, a trophy is a trophy and that would be awesome in and of itself.  But, perhaps more importantly for the future success, with the Open Cup sends the team into CCL and MLS gives extra allocation money to all MLS teams in the CCL.  And given our owner, any extra money that can only go towards signing players, that's a huge plus."

Now that 60% of the league will be going it's a meaningless achievement. Just because a team makes the playoffs doesn't mean they are a good team. Case in point- The Union are not yet eliminated from the playoffs. As a MLS fans, we need to stop pretending that making the playoffs has any value or meaning. A playoff win? Maybe even two? That means something.  The US Open Cup is a tall order, but it's not impossible. We've beat every MLS team still in the mix in our region, and I have absolute faith we could do it again. But going up against LA? Columbus? Houston? I'm not sure we've got it in us."

We have about as good a youth program as most MLS teams, nothing special. We were ahead of the pack at one point, but not any more.   Also, it's not an either / or situation.

As it stands there's no clear path from their youth system to the actual first team, and never has been. We also wouldn't have ruined so many young prospects over the years either.

Striker: -Your first developed player just scored against you. Maybe that's not fair, but the FO has moved to a one-striker system. Luckily, Sapong is performing and Fernando hopefully returned. Final note: how could you think Casey's body was going to last?  GK: -MacMath, not injured.  While each of these situations can be argued-for on an individual basis, the combination really makes you question an ""injury bug"" excuse...

PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,Husher315,9,Sun Jun 28 18:16:37 2015 UTC,I think Edu is a much better CB than a CDM.  He's been the least of our problems.
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,Dean_Moriarty,6,Sun Jun 28 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"My thoughts?  We have far worse problems than Edu.  He probably isn't living up to his DP status, but he's also played out of position due to a lack of club investment. He's had some really bad matches, but he is allowed them every once in a while after being such a leader on and off."
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,4-1-3-2,3,Mon Jun 29 03:33:40 2015 UTC,On a good team some of his bad matches would be covered up by other players. On this team nobody can really struggle without it having a huge impact on the overall performance.
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,goatyhead,11,Mon Jun 29 13:19:11 2015 UTC,Honestly I think we paid to much for him but I like his attitude and he is a solid player. You can talk trash about a team and player and still love the team. We are emotional beings and this team is like family and I have called my sister a penis hungry hooker before. Doesnt mean I dont love her.
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,spqr-king,5,Sun Jun 28 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"Despite being a prodigy in the CB role   he's made a lot of mistakes recently. that's been annoying me. and he doesnt always run hard to get back in the play. i want a captain/CB who is always running back on D.  my beef with him is his D, not O"
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,everydayasOrenG,5,Mon Jun 29 13:33:25 2015 UTC,"He's not terrible, he's just not worth the salary they pay him. He's serviceable in MLS, but not deserving a DP level salary when you look at what similarly paid players are doing."
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,EdBacon,3,Mon Jun 29 01:13:52 2015 UTC,"He captains the team with the most goals allowed in the league while playing a defensive position, he deserves the claims against him at times.  Honestly, people are usually too lenient against him, not the other way around."
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,drewuke,2,Sun Jun 28 22:19:25 2015 UTC,Yea but they're also one of the worst teams in the league on goals scored per game and he farther we get into the season the more he's asked to do much more than a regular centerback to support the attack and create chances. The system is one where he's going to get caught out of position occasionally. The problem is that it's Brian Carroll who's responsible for covering him defensively.
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,bmangan,2,Mon Jun 29 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"Just going off of last night,  I thought he had a poor game defensively, and was at fault for the first goal.  He's still or next option at cb and I hope he stays there even when vitoria is healthy."
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,truckloadof4skin,5,Sun Jun 28 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your point stating that the first goal was his fault. Marquez had a heavy overcommit, leading to the goal."

PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,hoax021,-2,Sun Jun 28 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"The only reason he scored that goal was because he was too lazy to track back. He should have been offsides but the last Montreal defender stupidly kept him onsides. Also, if Fabinho had missed the ball or it had gone past him, Edu would have been too far upfield to deal with the counter. He seems more interested in scoring goals than defending."
PhillyUnion,3bf8pd,FlapjackJackson,3,Sun Jun 28 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"i agree. i think perhaps him and 100% williams should be punished for not sprinting back on defense after going into the box on offensive pieces. their punishment should be not going into the box on offensive pieces. it's not like we've been good at that, anyway."

PhillyUnion,3bcymj,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sun Jun 28 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"Pros: Sapong, Ayuk, looking great, Maidonna with excellent ball skills and servicing as usual.  Union attack is finally fun to watch.  Also Fabinho is in form.  Cons: Defenders were constantly out of position and getting beat, lucky we didn't let in a third one to Piatti when he slipped in front of net.  This is pretty discouraging because I thought our D was looking a lot better at the beginning of this season compared to last season."

PhillyUnion,3bbiib,Dean_Moriarty,3,Sat Jun 27 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"Was really hoping to see McLaughling see some significant time tonight for the Union.  With Le Toux being questionable, Wenger in a rut, and Ayuk not showing too well recently, would have been a good time.   This is also the first news of any kind that I've heard on Bird. But apparently:   This will be Bird’s third match with the Islanders in the 2015 season. His first was during their 3rd Round U.S. Open Cup Match against the Rochester Rhinos on May 27, where he scored to break the scoreless tie and put the Islanders on top in the 106th minute.   Looks like he finally made his return to the field a month ago.  I was pretty excited when we drafted him, hopefully he can get int he swing of things quickly."
PhillyUnion,3bbiib,leftyboy87,3,Sat Jun 27 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"Wenger being ""in a rut"" is supremely polite. Jimmy should be seeing the field yesterday."

PhillyUnion,3b9yps,jpoRS,2,Sat Jun 27 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"This needs to be McLaughlin's game.   Edit: Apparently not.  Union loan McLaughlin, Bird, and Lee to the City Islanders for their match against Charleston tonight.  Side note, this is the first I've heard about Bird actually playing.  Heard a lot of good things about him when he was drafted, but have heard zero news on how he was progressing with his injury.  Good that he's finally playing again."

PhillyUnion,3b77sj,Dean_Moriarty,4,Fri Jun 26 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"Question: after seeing Sheanon Williams put in that beautiful ball for CJ vs Seattle, which is something I don't believe Gaddis can do, do we have a RB issue now? I think putting Gaddis at LB isn't the worst thing we could do.  I know defenders aren't all about offense, but in the evolving world of soccer, attacking fullbacks are valuable"
PhillyUnion,3b77sj,spqr-king,5,Fri Jun 26 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in favor of playing the hot hand.  So keep rolling out Fabinho and Williams until it stops working.    But in general I still think Ray is the best fullback on the team.  He's easily the best defensively, and the fastest too.    Williams is better going forward, but I think Union fans vastly overrate his ability to cross the ball.  For every ball like the assist to Sapong there are 20 lazy and wasteful crosses.    Long term I'd rather Ray at RB, he won't get better at crossing without playing RB in actual games."
PhillyUnion,3b77sj,etsjay,3,Fri Jun 26 19:16:30 2015 UTC,I like both of them and no matter what happens this is the least of our problems because we have two perfectly serviceable backs with loads of MLS experience. Gaddis was doing well before his injury and is a fan favorite and Williams is in the same boat. If Fabinho keeps doing well we can use him but we will eventually need another LB and not Gaddis someone with potential and skill at that position.

PhillyUnion,3b2npr,spqr-king,9,Thu Jun 25 14:00:19 2015 UTC,"Waited literally until security made me leave to get a signature for my son and Ayuk and McCarthy came over and signed his shirt. McCarthy had literally signed a few hundred autographs on the right side of the pitch and then walked all the way over before being told he had to leave by security. These young guys make me proud to be a supporter though a lot of young fans kind of pissed me off by asking for their gear when they were signing dozens of autographs. ""give me your jersey"" ""why arent you giving your shin guards away"" these two were asked multiple times so I was like ""can I get a selfie?"" Great guys, great attitude, happy fan.

Especially considering we like to play up against the big-boys.   ""Worst"" part of the win was that I think we tried to set up shop a little too early (which we have shown time after time that we are basically incapable of doing well), and it was really nerve-wrecking from about minute 75 to 89. If we can stumble upon another decent centre-half, we can move Edu up to his DM position. That's a better defensive-line and would allow us to sit more effectively (without even using subs).   Saying that, the biggest positive is that Sappong is looking great. He's taken that striker position and stamped his name all the fuck over it."

PhillyUnion,3b0qan,EdBacon,8,Thu Jun 25 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, Fred didn't play awful tonight. Would like to see Ayuk more, although he made some silly mistakes toward the end.  At least Sapong kept up his form and hopefully this gives us some confidence going into Saturday. But your right, same old Union for the most part, at least we got the 3 points that we should have on paper."
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,wiggums5,3,Thu Jun 25 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"There were points late in the game where fred was the only reason we held possesion. He held the ball confidently and passed it side to side, and backwards all the way around the clock from Wenger, to Fred, to Fabi, to Fred, to both CBs to Fred, to Ayuk, to Fred. I want to see the youth get minutes as much as anyone but Ayuk and Pfeffer both got significant time. Fred had a role came in and played it well. It's the role everyone expects Carroll to play but Carroll is playing even deeper."
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,bmangan,8,Thu Jun 25 13:06:31 2015 UTC,"Tonight was my first ever mls game, and I'm so happy that I got to see the union win! Great experience, great atmosphere."
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,Kookymantis,6,Thu Jun 25 04:34:56 2015 UTC,Mine too... I'm hooked
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,enlightenedego,4,Thu Jun 25 05:08:49 2015 UTC,I was at the game and I moaned when Fred was brought on but from what I saw I thought that he was effective at doing what he had to do which was just clearing the ball if in danger and possessing it.
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,FatboyAFC,6,Thu Jun 25 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"This feels weird for me to say, but I honestly feel really confident with Fabinho at left back. He's solid both the offensive and defensive ends, and he is constantly hustling. I don't know where this came from but I love this.  Marquez is solid at the back, I feel like he is the real deal especially paired with Edu at the back.  I love CJ, enough said."
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,cuzigothye,2,Thu Jun 25 03:15:33 2015 UTC,It looks like Curtin told Edu to not make those rampaging runs and I think that really helped with our defensive stability. Hopefully he can get Edu to think more like a centerback. It seemed like he finally realized he couldn't play like a midfielder. Edit: missing word
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,stw77,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:55:46 2015 UTC,"A big part of those runs is being down early. If they wanted to get back into the game they were going to need to get the ball, overload the midfield, and take chances to do so. Mo coming up was one of those chances. Sometimes it works, sometimes it blows up in your face but they had to do something. He won't be making as many of those runs in a game where they can maintain possesion and are creating significantly more chances than they give up. It's not him being in trouble with Curtin for it, so much as it probably being the game plan for both situations."
PhillyUnion,3b0qan,bmangan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:10:15 2015 UTC,Was that the first time Fred has played since he got that red card back at the beginning of the season?

PhillyUnion,3b0qan,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Jun 25 12:52:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it's wrong. Fred came in at the 66th minute against LA last Saturday."

There is no problem with wearing Montreal gear, but it is pretty rude to wear it in the middle of the supporters groups.

I attend very damn close to all home matches, and have done so for all but the first season. I have parked in an official lot probably five or six times at most in that time - even including the season when they gave us free parking.  I always do street parking a few blocks up from the stadium and walk. Never had a single issue. I've never seen other cars broken in to or damaged either. I'd be curious to hear anyone that has had a negative experience street parking. It's totally free and not only are you right near a very busy strip, but police patrol during and after the game. Leave the $20 used for parking for your first beer.  Chester can be a little dicey, but mostly it's just poor. Lock your car, don't drive the Porsche, and take your valuables with you."
PhillyUnion,3b1kwo,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:39:26 2015 UTC,The big thing about the unofficial lots is some of them will charge you even MORE than the official lots. And some of them are harder to get out of because they don't have parking attendants after the matches conducting traffic.

He was in talks with MLS in 2007 to bring a team to Philly and was ironing out the details, with the announcement coming in Feb 2008.  Coincidentally, 2007-2008 coincided with... The recession.  Why did the recession happen? The Housing Bubble burst.  It's easy to point fingers for the financial situation, but we basically got insanely unlucky.  Can't blame MLS for that."
PhillyUnion,3awffe,xxtoejamfootballxx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:38:52 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing but I looked up the stock price of iStar financial before the sale.

PhillyUnion,3awffe,rnc487,2,Wed Jun 24 15:12:49 2015 UTC,That's not earlier than the rest of the crash.  The US Housing Bubble hit its peak in 2006.  There was a decline until the actual burst where shit hit the fan in 2008.

As for Palacios, that fucking sucks. He would have been the absolute perfect signing for this team at DM."
PhillyUnion,3auk1c,_asper,5,Tue Jun 23 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"I like Nando, but he doesn't fit the team. He needs better players behind him to make him effective. Sapong works better for us since he can create his own shots."
PhillyUnion,3auk1c,khyleth,3,Tue Jun 23 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. To use Nando effectively we'd need good service from the wings or a second forward. I'd love to see him paired with Sapong, but we'd need a dominant DM and another backup striker to make that feasible."

PhillyUnion,3auk1c,everydayasOrenG,3,Tue Jun 23 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"The issue with it is that I expect the Marquez-Vitoria backline would look a lot like the White-Vitoria backline. They don't really seem to complement each other.  Also, Edu has proven over and over again he doesn't fit as a 6 on this team. He cares too much about going on his marauding runs which hangs the defense out to dry."

PhillyUnion,3aueyp,LocksTheFox,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone in my lineup has a DGW this week. I feel pretty good about my team, but I've also felt really good the past few weeks and have not done well at all.    But I think Sapong should be a really good option.  Dirt cheap, good candidate to start both games, two home games, and is in good form."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,Mountainhawk98,12,Mon Jun 22 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"stick it out. both Eagles and Phillies managed to eventually turn things around in one way or another. the other option is to let the team fold and then there isn't a team at all. I think the general consensus is that the problem is the ownership, but really how can we expect to change that? protest some more?   sure, this isn't fun to watch them lose, but at least we have something. USOC is a tournament that we can try to thrive in if other teams don't take it as seriously, sort of like last year. sell the dead weight (M'Bohli) buy cheap players who are worth it (Nogs).  I think at this point we just need to hope things turn around, but there is no reason to think that they never will. look at DC, with some smart moves we could realistically be a mid-table team and when the league grows then we grow too. there's no point in just giving up"
PhillyUnion,3apseo,oooooooounbelievable,6,Mon Jun 22 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"The key is ""with some smart moves."" When is the last time this front office or coaching staff has been accurately labeled as smart?"
PhillyUnion,3apseo,FlapjackJackson,4,Mon Jun 22 20:36:07 2015 UTC,Nogueira as a non-DP signing was the best move that I can remember. but that's all that comes to mind right now.
PhillyUnion,3apseo,oooooooounbelievable,3,Mon Jun 22 20:40:27 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, we signed him to be a 10, not an 8. We lucked into him fitting in well elsewhere. Even then, we signed a player that thrives on a team that can string together passes and hold possession. We responded by surrounding him a bunch of athletes who can't pass or move."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,FlapjackJackson,3,Mon Jun 22 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"do you have a source? not trying to discredit you, but I always put that down to Hack playing him out of position haha. I thought he played CM at Sochaux.   anyway, I think Hack tried to create that team with a limited budget by signing Maidana, playing Leo Fernandes, etc. but ultimately failed. with Sapong and Nando on the team now, I have more confidence that they can move better as a team than last season, as long as they don't pass to our awful wide players"
PhillyUnion,3apseo,oooooooounbelievable,2,Mon Jun 22 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"There were articles from when the players were first signed. However, you can also look at how Hack lined Noggy, Edu, and Maidana up at the beginning of last season. Maidana was played out wide, Nogy was the 10, and Edu was the 8. All three of our big name signings all played in different spots than they do now."

PhillyUnion,3apseo,4-1-3-2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:57:32 2015 UTC,"Initially, he was starting as a 10 in the lineup. I think the FO misread his game when they signed him. It worked out well when he was pushed back into his normal spot."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:10:06 2015 UTC,"The problem is obsession with playoffs. I say ""fuck it,"" play your best 11 in the Open Cup, and use the rest of the season to see which of your budget/young players can contribute going forward.   For example, we don't need to see any more of Brian Carroll unless you are still trying to make the (ridiculous) playoffs. We know what he is. Great leader. Good defensive midfielder in the league. Plays his damn role. Brings stability.  But can we get away with Pfeffer, Maidana, Nogueira? The minutes 10-20 against LA looked great. Best possession and cycling of the ball I've seen recently. Is that a combo you could actually ride to victory with time to gel? I dunno. But I DO know that Carroll, Maidana, Nogueira isn't winning the SS or MLS Cup.  Barring injury issues, see also: Richie Marquez the real deal? (Ethan White not a starting-caliber MLS CB), Eric Ayuk can learn how to not look at his feet while dribbling? Jimmy McLaughlin ever going to feature? Etc.  Back to the original point >>> These are all things that need room to breath. Cannot judge rookies and kids on 1 or 2 appearances. You need to be willing to lose badly, rather than ""compete"" and lose, for the rest of the season. I don't know if this FO and coaching staff will do that kind of thing...  Ninja edit: BC is the kinda guy that would get a sympathy trade in another American sport. One last chance for another ring."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,keystonemike,2,Mon Jun 22 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is obsession with playoffs. I say ""fuck it,"" play your best 11 in the Open Cup   I agree with this point 100%, but just want to clarify...   For example, we don't need to see any more of Brian Carroll    Does this mean you don't want to see him in the Open Cup, the league, or both? I don't think we can win much with Pfeffer Maidana and Nogueira. Too little defensive cover, which seems to be our main problem. I'm a fan of playing Lahoud when he's healthy or buying a new defensive mid this summer.  Marquez has been pretty good for the most part, but I think Vitoria is better. the choice between the two for me is based on how much money you want to spend. if freeing Vitoria will allow us to get a LB, LW, etc. then maybe we let him go, but then we need more CB depth, and the cycle continues.  Ayuk and McLaughlin I'd like to see more of especially against ""better"" teams at home (like Wednesday against Seattle). that gives us the option of resting some key players for the Open Cup, but also gives the impression of giving up on the league. regardless of what we want, Curtin needs to rotate the squad more and we need more depth in almost every position.   You need to be willing to lose badly, rather than ""compete"" and lose, for the rest of the season. I don't know if this FO and coaching staff will do that kind of thing...   Completely agree again, but I don't think every fan wants to see that. The season ticket holders are more likely to want this, but the casual fan who might go to a few games wants to see a win or at least a good game. If we broadcast the fact that we're willing to lose badly then we'll start seeing an empty seats as well.  re: Brian Carroll... he's already won a cup so I think he should stick it out here if he's willing to give us some seniority and leadership"
PhillyUnion,3apseo,oooooooounbelievable,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen Vitoria/Marquez w/ Edu as holding mid. I'd like to see that. Otherwise, I tend to agree. Carroll as CDM is still probably your best chance of success within the system. Keep him healthy and play him in the OC. I was just saying that I appreciate his game, and not playing him is more about the team than his ability.  re: casual fans. Unfortunately, the FO put themselves in this position. Ideally, you don't need to decide between tanking and going all-out. Part of that is coaching, part is GM stuff. But there are MLS squads who routinely cycle their 18 and 11 each season to gain depth. The Union (IMO) tend to have more of a boom/bust cycle. Like, even if we started a season well, I would fully expect the same 11 game in, game out, regardless of opposition squad makeup or tactics/home vs. away/etc."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,keystonemike,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:02:18 2015 UTC,"I usually think that Edu is best on the back line, but yea why not give that a try at this point. Yea I see your point about Carroll, I just think we're not in a position to let anyone leave without a replacement right now.  As far as the same starting 11, that's another flaw the union have. When was the last time we've ever approached a game with a different plan than ""use the last line-up if it worked""? That's down mostly to coaching, something that hasn't improved since Nowak left."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,oooooooounbelievable,2,Mon Jun 22 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"I also agree about Edu. Here is the thing, though: If the FO and coaching staff came out and said ""Look, Mo is 29. We locked him down for a multi-year deal, and we truly believe that his best position is at CB. Regardless of what occurs at CDM, he will be playing CB, because we believe that is the best way to build for the future. This is especially in light of our other CBs competing for a spot. Our goal is to develop a 2 CB tandem through this season that we can rely on for several years."" Then, I'd be ok. Instead, it ends up being whatever the current emergency is... That's no way to run a business or club.  Yes. You are exactly right. It's always very short-term thinking. There is no development arc."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,keystonemike,4,Mon Jun 22 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"I think at this point we should throw everything into the USOC. The issues that are keeping us a submediocre team will take some fixing. Our academy should start to generate players that we can incorporate into the team or sell off and that will free up some money. The movement for a change in high level management needs to keep growing, a couple wins should not shut everybody up about the ownerships poor decision making skills."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,Dean_Moriarty,4,Mon Jun 22 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"Curtin and Albright may or may not be the the guys for the job, but they aren't the ones who put the team in the position they are in. And unless Jose Mourinho is waiting in the wings, I think they deserve a chance to try and dig the team out of this pit. And another mid-season manager firing won't do the team any good.   We are still feeling the reverberations of previous bad moves from Sak.  Selling M'Bolhi, and signing a quality CDM and LB will go a long way I think.   I assume Vitoria is on a season long loan, but if there's anyway we can cut that short would be good I think.  Nothing against Vitoria, he's been OK, but with the emergence of Marquez, we could sure put that Vitoria cap hit towards getting a better winger."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,Mike81890,2,Mon Jun 22 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think Marquez is ready to be a starter. He's athletic and he shows promise, but the game against LA showed that he doesn't have the mentality to start in MLS. There's a reason most people say that defenders peak later in their careers.   I would love to see a guy like Liam Ridgewell come in. An experienced LB who can also play CB. Our team has a lot of holes in it and when you play a really ""together"" team like LA you'll get found out. Curtin starting Sheanon on the left instead of Fabinho showed that he knew it was a weakness that could be exposed. We just don't have enough pieces to work with. Why are we subbing Fred on to save us?  That being said, some of Curtin's decisions have been absolutely baffling. Why hasn't McLaughlin got any minutes? If Curtin thinks he isn't ready then why did we loan out Cruz? We don't have enough players who are good enough."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,goatyhead,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't judge Marquez too harshly given his partner was invariably out of position pretty much the entire game. And Carroll forgot he needs to be a stay at home shield for the back four. No one on D was coming out of that game looking good anyway.  I think your last point is the entire issue, this roster is just barely capable of putting a MLS caliber starting lineup together week to week. Any injuries or suspensions make that so very obvious.  Seriously why is Curtin starting the same guys, game after game after game? Clearly the players can't take the strain, just look at the injury reports it's ridiculous. And when a game is as far out of reach as the LA game was it's utterly nonsensical to leave young legs on the bench. There is zero benefit to putting Fred and Fabi out there, at least let someone else get some minutes. It's astounding, really, like I'm absolutely confused how this keeps happening. Throw away minutes should be for young player development not to get Fred out there so he can try and get another red card in a sub appearance."

PhillyUnion,3apseo,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"Marquez is at the age where he needs minutes to develop. We aren't going to suddenly stop being shit, so now is the time to let him figure the mental side out."

PhillyUnion,3apseo,FlapjackJackson,5,Mon Jun 22 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"This team will continue to be a laughing stock until we sign a GM, hire an actual coaching staff of more than 4 people, figure out how to bridge the academy and team, develop an actual plan and style for this team, and begin signing players to fit said plan. Pretty much, we are screwed until Nick Sak is gone. That being said, Curtin has done a piss poor job using his resources this year. He needs to be replaced if we are to take a step forward."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,xenoletum,2,Mon Jun 22 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"Reminder that while we have only made the playoffs once in our five seasons, Toronto FC has never made it to the playoffs in their eight season.   This after they've had Klinsmann do a reassessment of the team, this after they signed Bradley, De Rosario, and Defoe. Yet somehow their fans are just as supportive.  Just a reminder that it could always be worse."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,Too_many_hippos,2,Mon Jun 22 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"Meh, keep your head up and your hopes up.  The great thing about this league is that there really is no guarantee how a game will go and how a team will end up at the end of the season. Remember when we faced DC and we thought there was no way we would win? Remember when we beat NYRB for the first time ever at their own stadium!? Those results were completely against what everyone thought would happen.  This team, to put it bluntly, sucks right now. But who's to say where we will be at the end? Things could turn around soon, maybe after the next transfer window. We could make it to the final of the USOC this year and maybe win it. We could have a playoff spot this year as well.   Maybe next game we start off a win streak, or an undefeated streak. Maybe we don't. The point is you never know what will happen next, not 100% and that's why we should all keep our hopes up. The Union are as frustrated as we are, remember that. No player wants to be responsible for being at the bottom of the table week after week. So I say we still hold on to hope, they might surprise us."
PhillyUnion,3apseo,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"Give Curtin the end of the season, if he doesn't make playoffs then we look for a new coach.  However, they're going to just do the same thing again with the interim coach, so the circle will repeat.  The ownership doesn't give a shit.  If you're not having fun, don't watch it.  I enjoy watching the games still and look forward to them, but look at it like this: If it feels like a chore, then it's pointless. We're fans, it's supposed to be recreation.  I am a die-hard follower and supporter, but keep in mind that this is supposed to be fun.  Why kill 2 hours of your saturday when you can do something else if you're not having fun?"

Don't let him back on the field until he's ready to run through a brick wall for this team.  His confidence is shot so you can't really hurt that at this point.  Sell M'Bolhi and reinvest in a dmid, left back, or winger. We now have 3 league home games in a row.  Win all 3 and maybe we sneak into 6th on ppg basis and just fight it out until the end.

PhillyUnion,3akrz5,_axaxaxax,-1,Mon Jun 22 03:02:23 2015 UTC,Oh god come off it with your fascist censorship bullshit. It's hyperbole illustrating the helplessness of our team and the dominance of the other team over us. It's an expression that is fittingly used when describing a sporting event like last nights rout.
PhillyUnion,3akrz5,bigdogg123,3,Mon Jun 22 03:13:42 2015 UTC,Nobody's censoring you or anybody else.  Are people not allowed to share there opinion's on rape jokes?  Personally I agree it's a shitty thing to joke about
PhillyUnion,3akrz5,FlapjackJackson,3,Mon Jun 22 11:17:22 2015 UTC,"Fascist? I don't think you know what fascism actually is if you think traditional leftist values like WGS issues are fascism. It's actually almost hilarious and very childish that you are attempting to use the fascist and censorship label to dispel my opinion on something.  There are plenty of potential hyperbolic images that could be utilized without trivializing sexual violence. Considering 1 in 4 women and 1 in 33 men are sexual assaulted within their life time, it's a pretty shitty thing to joke about as it propagates rape culture. I know several women and a few men that have been sexually assaulted, and they would likely agree that joking about it makes you seem like a child."
PhillyUnion,3akrz5,_axaxaxax,-5,Mon Jun 22 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"It's fascist to demand that someone be silenced because you don't agree with something they say/do. You're not working on a line so much as a horseshoe, at either end they're suspiciously close.  It's childish and immature to dismiss an entire group of fans because of a single joke a single person made that hurt your feelings.  It's even MORE childish and immature to project the responsibility for your own emotional well being onto others around you. You do not have a right to not be offended. If you cannot cope with hearing things you disagree with or are offended by in a public space that is YOUR problem not the problem of everybody else. You should either commit yourself until you are stable enough to function in society, seek more intensive therapies, or grow the fuck up.  It's fine to be offended by things but that doesn't give you any sort of special rights. Being offended by something does not make you a good person, being offended on behalf of other people does not make you a good person.  You don't gain any sort of moral high ground just by being offended by something. You aren't more right simply because you are offended. The pope isn't going to come down and sign the cast they put your hurt feelings in simply because you declare ""that offends me""."
PhillyUnion,3akrz5,FlapjackJackson,4,Mon Jun 22 16:50:28 2015 UTC,"I am sorry that you seem to think being offended is childish or weak, and I am sorry that you seem to think that your crude jokes matter more than people. Perhaps one day you will recognize that just because you can offend others doesn't mean you should."
PhillyUnion,3akrz5,_axaxaxax,-1,Mon Jun 22 19:42:41 2015 UTC,Didn't say that but I guess since you can't say anything againsy the validity of what I actually said you had to go that route.

W(est), W, E(ast), W, W, W, E, W, W, W, E, E, W, E, E, E, E, E, W, E.  The last MLS East team to have won the MLS Cup was Sporting, but they've since moved to MLS West.

Not the case.  I hate seeing S. Williams jog back after being out of position on a quick transition, as he did on the 3rd or 4th goal. He is a talented player who has no confidence at this point and doesn't play as hard as he should. Nogueira could have picked up Zardes on that goal too.

PhillyUnion,3a5nad,kyleisgreattt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:25:07 2015 UTC,I watched the live stream but ignored the chat lol There are a ton of great locations in northern DE that they could look at I think the Blue Rocks Stadium would be best because the parking is already established and there appears to be space for a small stadium but there are a great deal of other locations.
PhillyUnion,3a5nad,kyleisgreattt,2,Wed Jun 17 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"Northern Delaware, New Castle County in general, is a soccer hotbed.  Edit:  The Blue Rocks Stadium is supposedly going to get some renovations because the team is supposed to jump to Double A.  So, there's definitely potential to put a soccer team in there.  Also, the high school I graduated from in Wilmington had kids from PA, NJ, and MD, so I don't think the distance is as far as some people think."

PhillyUnion,3a45vf,SmugMacGyver,3,Wed Jun 17 12:14:35 2015 UTC,"I hate to be Negladelphian... but man that was a poor showing. Rochester isn't bad for a USL team, but they're still a USL team. They had quite a few really bad turnovers, a few moments where desperate clearances stopped goal scoring chances, and not very many moments of offensive quality. The Union should have been able to put this team away in regulation time. McCarthy will get a lot of praise for his PK stops, but I thought he had a pretty terrible game. There were 3 moments where he was too quick off his line and he got lucky his defenders saved him. Any one of those could have just as easily ended up in the net and that's the game. Ayuk and McLaughlin didn't do anything this game to show me that they deserve starting minutes over Le Toux or Wenger, which is shocking because I think Le Toux and Wenger need to be benched badly.   I'm glad we won, but I do not have high hopes for this club if we keep playing like we did last night."
PhillyUnion,3a45vf,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"The Rhinos are the only team to win the US Open Cup, that were not in MLS, since the leagues inception.

PhillyUnion,3a45vf,DrewGo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"I dunno, how good a team is doesn't normally have much to do if they will be considered for expansion.  Market size, owners, and fanbase are the major factors.  Probably in that order too.    I think Salt Lake is currently the smallest metro market in MLS and according to Wikipedia they are still larger than Rochester."
PhillyUnion,3a45vf,SmugMacGyver,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Rhinos are the only non-MLS team to have won the US Open Cup. When did they win it? 1999.   The MLS is leaps and bounds ahead of where it was back then. I know that MLS teams lose to USL/NASL teams in this tournament, but last night Rochester didn't look worthy of toppling an MLS team, certainly not one that was fielding most of it's starters.   The Union played one of the poorer games I've seen them play this season. I just hope that it's because they were talking a lower division team lightly and not indicative of them losing the form they seemed to find in the NYRB, Columbus and DC games."
PhillyUnion,3a45vf,DrewGo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:06:10 2015 UTC,Dude they nearly won that game. That late chance when McCarthy was off the line right before OT was only nearly saved by the back line when he was out of goal.  They might not be spectacular but they nearly toppled is repeatedly. We did much the same to them but they are a better team than most in their league.
PhillyUnion,3a45vf,NaranjaEclipse,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that they almost beat us, that's what I'm complaining about. I'm saying they shouldn't have been able to almost beat us. Like I said above, they are probably the best team in USL, but what I saw on the field last night was not MLS level play. It was definitely a step below that, and the Union sank to their level. The game was slow, sloppy and disorganized, and if the Union want to win in MLS they have to play much better than that."

He had one nice move in the second half to create a scoring opportunity but that was it.  On the corner following that attempt he wasn't even paying attention when the ball was put into play.  He's done.

PhillyUnion,39xhxg,khyleth,4,Mon Jun 15 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"He's been very poor the past few years, I wouldn't be too excited about this."
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,Guidosama,2,Mon Jun 15 20:29:27 2015 UTC,Wow that would be really cool. I haven't seen him play this year. Assuming he didn't feature for Stoke?  Am I confusing him with someone else or can he also play fullback?
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,Mike81890,2,Mon Jun 15 16:51:51 2015 UTC,I sure hope not. I was so happy to see him leave Stoke.
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,JLRedditsStuff,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:52:48 2015 UTC,"He played RM, CDM, RB, and bench for Stoke iirc. All positions we have filled. Get a CB and move EDU up if you want another CDM. Ayuk looks great often at RM. Ayuk is cheap. Let him develop. RB? Rather have Gaddis honestly. Fill the voids FO. This would be yet another stupid signing."
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,Urbutthurt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:33:12 2015 UTC,We can't be seriously looking at guys because they need somewhere to train. Smh put the focus where it should be FO.
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,magnumbbrown,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:38:26 2015 UTC,Seriously look away.
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,4-1-3-2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"Why are we developing this theme of looking at Stoke castoffs?   On paper Palacios looks like a good fit for MLS, but his form at Stoke and for Honduras in the last WC make me a little dubious. Besides, he's going to be expensive..."
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,EdBacon,2,Mon Jun 15 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't be that expensive.  He's going to be a free transfer on July 1st, he hasn't played a match for Stoke in a season, and it looks like he isn't getting much attention.  Mid six figures at worst, I would imagine."
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,EdBacon,2,Mon Jun 15 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"Just saw that part, yeah. Could be promising if he's willing to come over for the right price."
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:31:05 2015 UTC,Eh I'd be willing to be we get him for under a million and unless they amortize the cost of the transfer fee (to make him a DP for a year or two which I hope they don't but I know they will) he might not be DP level money.
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,EdBacon,2,Mon Jun 15 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"That's the main sticking point for me. I'd be interested to see what he  can do, and we need an upgrade to Carrol and Lahoud at CDM, but I'd rather not blow DP money on that position when we're still missing starters at 2-3 other positions."
PhillyUnion,39xhxg,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Mon Jun 15 18:20:32 2015 UTC,Apparently he was released on a free transfer so fuck it I say go for it (as long as he's under 400k salary which I bet he will be)
PhillyUnion,39xruo,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Jun 15 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"I like Palacios coming in, I hope they pull that trigger. Since he's free I don't think it'll be too much of a loss if he doesn't pan out (as long as they don't sign him to some stupid deal)  I like Sylvestre. I think he should stay but I dunno how that'll work out with Blake unless Sylvestre is backup? Assuming Blake pans out which I really hope we'll see him this season in order to make that judgement."

EDIT: Also added John Arne Riise, who we had been linked with, and Facundo Coria, who had been on trial, to the discard pile."
PhillyUnion,39u5ft,drewuke,5,Sun Jun 14 20:16:02 2015 UTC,Honestly I am kind of in the mind set that the Open Cup is our only hope for a successful season after looking at how many matches we have played compared to the rest of the division.
PhillyUnion,39u5ft,spqr-king,4,Sun Jun 14 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not optimistic for this year's Open Cup. Our lack of depth was our downfall against Seattle last year. That problem has only gotten worse this year. I WANT to win, but if we got knocked out early, I'd at least take solace that we'd be able to rest our veteran players more often. We cannot have any more injuries or we'll be dead last in the East at the end of this season."
PhillyUnion,39u5ft,grubber788,2,Mon Jun 15 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"The organization seems to think we can just show up and be successful. They are positioning us as 'reigning finalists' (technically true, but not something I've ever seen a team brag about). We got to the final last year by beating 2 lower league sides (needing overtime), beating a disinterested Revs and MacMath doing the heroics against Dallas. Things fell our way."
PhillyUnion,39plyf,spqr-king,9,Sat Jun 13 14:55:59 2015 UTC,Yes! Yes! Yes!
PhillyUnion,39plyf,Mike81890,3,Sat Jun 13 16:33:09 2015 UTC,We can only hope.  Nice to see that there are somehow clubs still interested in him though.
PhillyUnion,39plyf,bigdogg123,4,Sat Jun 13 15:00:27 2015 UTC,And for almost full transfer. I think they are hoping because Turkey is heavily muslim the culture shock will not be so bad and he will bring his family. Also I mean lets be honest he wouldnt be a bad bench player to have if his attitude wasnt shit.
PhillyUnion,39plyf,LocksTheFox,2,Sat Jun 13 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"from what I've been told, he's VERY religious, often leads the Algerian NT in prayer"
PhillyUnion,39plyf,Davidmm18,3,Sat Jun 13 21:17:10 2015 UTC,I wouldnt be surprised he spoke about that a lot in the interview I watched before he came over. Seemed like a good enough guy just a bad situation and attitude after the initial reaction and such. Hopefully wont be our problem much longer.

PhillyUnion,39o9iu,RubeRx,3,Sat Jun 13 04:50:20 2015 UTC,Marquez is quicker than Vitoria and more positionally sound.
PhillyUnion,39o9iu,ebradlee10,2,Sun Jun 14 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"I think he definitely is the favorite to do so. But with Vitoria coming back, who knows"
PhillyUnion,39o9iu,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:36:47 2015 UTC,"On a non-fantasy note, is it possible that we'll see Marquez and Vitoria together in the back with Edu pushed back into the midfield?"
PhillyUnion,39o9iu,9guy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:39:30 2015 UTC,Not likely with how Edu has performed at CB. He has really solidified that backline.
PhillyUnion,39o9iu,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"I've said before, I think pairing Vitoria-Marquez and moving Edu to DM puts our best players on the field. Vitoria played well for us and shouldn't be sitting on the bench. With the emergence of Marquez, Edu's value as a CB to this team drops and he could move back to his preferred spot at DM. I'd like to see a few games with a midfield of Maidana, Nogs, and Edu."
PhillyUnion,39o9iu,zb313,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:41:41 2015 UTC,I think he will continue to start if he continues this form. For a younger player he seems to pair really well with Edu but also does all the little things right that you look for in a CB.

Notably I remember seeing myself in the stands of the game against the Cosmos while watching a replay on youtube.  I haven't heard if they are or aren't going to do it again this year, but my understanding is that the Open Cup people are kind of trying to get more exposure so it would certainly make sense."

PhillyUnion,39bcsc,Dean_Moriarty,5,Wed Jun 10 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"Good to hear. Maybe he'll be healthy enough for some Open Cup starts. Our 1st overall pick deserves a string of games finally, as long as he's healthy.  I also don't trust McCarthy against some of the larger teams if I'm completely honest."
PhillyUnion,39bcsc,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Wed Jun 10 18:24:21 2015 UTC,Didn't he get another surgery though? I think he needs to sit out and recuperate for quite awhile to make sure this doesn't happen again (as much as we can). As much as I'd like to see him play I'm happy with Sylvestre in the interim.
PhillyUnion,39bcsc,_axaxaxax,2,Thu Jun 11 13:16:06 2015 UTC,"The problem is Sylvestre is cap tied so he can't play in the Open Cup for us. McCarthy might be fine for the 1st match but I'm not sold on him starting anything just yet, if ever. I'd far prefer Blake getting minutes if he's healthy enough.   I'm not sure what his knee injuries were, I think both were meniscal tears. So if he's not at risk for damaging it again somehow I think Curtin needs to get over his boner for guys being 101% ready before getting time."
PhillyUnion,39bcsc,goatyhead,2,Thu Jun 11 13:49:53 2015 UTC,"Ooh I didn't know he was cap tied, I don't really trust McCarthy in goal at all yet."
PhillyUnion,39bcsc,_axaxaxax,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:01:31 2015 UTC,I actually don't know if he had surgery or not but I assume the fact that he's back with the team means he's at least close to being ready again.

PhillyUnion,3936q1,midwesternhousewives,7,Mon Jun 8 22:44:42 2015 UTC,"I think we should try to convince Edu his place is at CB. We should try to find a young LB who can share minutes with Fabinho, and a real game changer on the wing.   I imagine it'll be an unpopular opinion, but Carroll has proven he can still play. If Lahoud comes back, Carroll keeps it up, and Edu fills in when needed then we're OK at DM (especially if that homegrown player is ready as someone else in this thread mentioned).  Otherwise I think this team just needs to gel, Jimmy needs time, and we, as fans, need to calm down. Nando was a good pick up, Sapong was a good pick up, and Sylvestre was a good pick up. This team has made more right moves in the last 6 months than wrong ones. I know it's a small sample size, but I think the organization is improving."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,Mike81890,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:22:42 2015 UTC,I agree about Carroll.
PhillyUnion,3936q1,zb313,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:43:44 2015 UTC,"Carroll is playing well right now, but he is not a starter at this point in his career. His place is as a sub or emergency injury starter. Now that Marquez has emerged as a legitimate CB, I think it makes most sense to move Edu to DM and pair Vitoria-Marquez. People around here are really underrating Vitoria's level of play and seem to have forgotten about him entirely.   Number one need is a winger for sure. Then LB. Sell MBohli, Valdes, and maybe even Wenger if we get a decent offer."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,oooooooounbelievable,2,Tue Jun 9 14:24:16 2015 UTC,"I think people also forget that Lahoud was doing decently well pre-injury, so I honestly see him replacing Carroll when he's ready. Curtin loves Edu's speed and vision at the back, so I'm not sure if he'll push him back to DM. The fact is, we have some decent depth in central defenders and central midfielders, now if we could just get some decent wingers..."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,EdBacon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"Whenever Edu played in MF then Nogs became invisible. That midfield pairing needs a midfielder sitting deep over top of the backline to break up plays and that Nogs can track back to when he needs to relieve pressure. Edu has the tendency to float upfield too much and Nogs loses him on the field. His passes completed has been higher when paired with a midfielder other than Edu. So I'm a little hesitant to move Edu back to midfield since I feel Nogs is a much better player, I'd rather build around him. Lahoud is a decent option in the interim, but a real CDM might be something we should look into acquiring. Think Carrol but five or six years younger."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:39:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to make of Vitoria. He's slow and doesn't utilize his height very well on set pieces. He's not amazing at distribution. And he's been injured for weeks on end. Also, he's apparently very quiet and aloof and not much of a fit in the locker room.   With all that said, I feel like there's potential there, but unless it reveals itself soon (once he's back to playing), I don't know whether he's worth locking down long term."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,DrewGo,4,Thu Jun 11 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"I know everyone's clamoring for a left back, but honestly, I've always thought we were better at fullback than it seemed. Williams is one of the best fullbacks in the league, Gaddis is a beast of a defender who was playing below his potential, and Fabinho has been proving to us why Curtin may have been right to protect him in the expansion draft, but even if he doesn't keep up this level of play he's a good backup, if a risky one.   CDM... I've always been a fan of Brian Carroll. I've said it in this sub before, but the man is a positional wizard. He know's how to play the position as good as anyone in the league. He's turned back the clock these last few games, and he's done very well. Mike Lahoud looked very good before he got hurt, and there's no reason to believe he can't bounce back and earn starting minutes if Carroll can't keep this up come the fall.   Keeper... I agree that we should keep Sylvestre around, at least until the end of the season when we can probably bring MacMath back. M'bolhi needs to go, but that one's pretty obvious. I honestly think Blake is the answer in the future, he just needs to get healthy. We'll see how that goes.   Our biggest need is on the wing. I love Le Toux, but a winger he ain't. Wenger has more potential out there, but he clearly got jinxed by all of the offseason hype. The guy needs some pressure to be taken off of him. I think we need someone who can actually play in the wide position. With a real threat on the wings this team will be VERY dangerous."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,FlapjackJackson,6,Tue Jun 9 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"Sign Sylvestre. At worst, he is a good backup. Sign some homegrowns. Someone like Sean Wilson would be great since he plays DM. Now is the time to get him some sub minutes. A starting DM. No need to explain. A winger or two. Our wide play is abysmal. We need an actual winger who has pace, can run at defenders, and who can whip in a good cross. No converted forwards."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,Invol2ver,2,Mon Jun 8 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"Curious what your thoughts are on this:  Marquez has shown that he is ready to play CB in MLS, in my opinion he has been a nice surprise. When Vitoria comes back from injury, do we really need to go and get a DM? Why not slide Edu up to DM and give him opportunities to move the ball? I understand he bailed us out of a terrible back line situation earlier this year...but White has faded and Marquez has stepped up. Vitoria was good when he did play.  Thoughts?"
PhillyUnion,3936q1,FlapjackJackson,2,Tue Jun 9 13:48:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, Edu doesn't fit the DM mold for this team. We need a stay-at-home guy to anchor the midfield who allows Nogueira to go forward with freedom. Mo makes too many runs up field which forces Nogueira to cover for him. Besides, Mo has been really good at CB."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,Invol2ver,2,Tue Jun 9 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree Mo has been very good at CB. It seems likely that either Marquez or Vitoria are going to be playing off the bench once Vitoria is healthy. I think that's a shame because I believe they are both better at their position than Carroll or Lahoud are at DM.  Hard to argue with results though. This defense has been much more comfortable since Mo moved back. I think they needed a voice back there. Zac used to be that, Rais was not. I don't think Ethan or Vitoria were either. I've seen Marquez talking/organizing the guys back there during play a bit since he's been starting...that's awesome to see but he's still very green."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,goatyhead,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:34:28 2015 UTC,"4-1-2-1-2 might work if you do that.  Slot in Carroll or Lahoud at DM, put Nogs and Edu in the middle and let Chaco roam ahead of them.  I guess you'd go Fernando/Sapong up top?"
PhillyUnion,3936q1,DrewGo,2,Tue Jun 9 16:48:17 2015 UTC,Like a 4-4-2 with a narrow diamond midfield? Even with that setup I like Edu at CB and Carroll/Lahoud at CDM. I'd start Pfeffer and Nogs as the shuttlers with Maidana as the point of the diamond. Sapong and Nando up top.
PhillyUnion,3936q1,goatyhead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's worth a shot if we continue to get crap production from wingers. I mean LeToux has been better but Wenger, well, we all know how things have gone for him so far.  I like Edu at CB too, but if he agitates to be in the midfield we'll need to do something to make it happen. He's too important to this team to not at least be given chances at his preferred position. Plus Marquez has completely earned a spot, if Vitoria is healthy they could be a great pairing potentially.   If you have Sapong/Nando up top how do you see them working together?"
PhillyUnion,3936q1,DrewGo,2,Thu Jun 11 13:45:59 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that Edu doesn't want to play CDM. Edu wants to play in a #8 role. He wants to get up the field and contribute to goals. You can see it when he makes those deep runs out of the back. So when he plays next to Nogueira, Vincent's ability to get forward and provide outlet passes is limited because Edu gets forward too much. I love Edu, but Nogueira is much more important in midfield. Edu's an amazing defender and an excellent leader. He's, in my opinion, one of the best center backs in the league. If he wants the team to win, the way he can help the most is in the back. If he wants to be selfish and play in the midfield even if it's worse for the team... Is he really the kind of leader we want for the franchise?   Vitoria was serviceable, and he might play well next to Marquez, but Maruqez and Edu are the best CB pair we've seen since Okugo and Parke went on that great run in 2013. Also, Vitoria is on Loan. Right now, in my book, the guy needs to do something to prove he deserves a spot on the team. Marquez is younger, more athletic, and still really solid positionally. I see no reason to take him off the field.   Sapong and Nando up top... definitely presents some issues. They both like to occupy the same space as a big, physical forwards. They were in eachother's way a lot in the home opener against Colorado, and I can definitely see that being a problem if they're both playing forward. But at this point I want to see our best players on the field, and like you said, Le Toux and Wenger just aren't that right now. Ideally, either Nando or Sapong would play a little more like Casey does and know when to drift wide, hold up play, and make a pass that would release a midfielder making a deep run. That would pull the defense out of shape and allow the other striker to crash the box and look to finish the final pass that Maidana, Nogueria or Pfeffer send in."
PhillyUnion,3936q1,goatyhead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:21:27 2015 UTC,What about letting Edu go all ball playing defender from the CB spot? Some of his recent rushes upfield have been huge catalysts for attacks. With a staunchly defensive DM in front of him to cover the gaps it could not only give him the activity he's looking for but also give us an added attack dimension other teams have to deal with.
PhillyUnion,3936q1,jedihouse1348,-1,Fri Jun 12 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"Sell Wenger! No really, PLEASE!"

A good winger would be great cuz Wenger needs to go on sabbatical.  Either loan Sylvestre for the rest of the season or sign him. He's earned it.  Send Wenger to HCI or anywhere else who'll take him on loan. His head's not right and he's not going to recover it as fast struggling at this level.

PhillyUnion,38xf8c,4-1-3-2,0,Mon Jun 8 03:12:36 2015 UTC,"By this point in time, he has coached a full year. Also, not being able to effectively rotate players, make effective and timely substitutes, and adapt his game plan are more than ""small mistakes."" His management has cost us several points this year."
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,FlapjackJackson,2,Mon Jun 8 17:34:29 2015 UTC,"This is his first season as a full coach and the ability to make real decisions that are fully his. I vote for our opinion be held until we either make or fail to make the playoffs.   While important, substitutions and player selection are small-time and will improve with experience. You look like a genius one minute and an idiot the next. The real work is done preparing, training, creating a culture, and setting a system / philosophy. If done right the rest falls into place."

It's not even long enough for viable results in competitive european play. I think he's good from what I've seen, he's willing to make changes and we've seen some fantastic winning runs during his tenure... but I fully believe he needs at least another season in the role before we'll see his full potential to raise our table status. It just takes time to fully understand your FO, your players, the tactics they know, teach roles/tactics that you think will work better, etc etc...  For comparison's sake, Chelsea and their rotating manager every .75 seasons for 6 years in late 2000s, minimal wins. Brought veteran Mourinho back, and the team is breaking club records. Manc United - after Sir Fergie's departure, no longer kings of the Prem League despite having top talent."
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,IPv6_and_BASS,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"At the same time, incompetence won't get better with time. Hackworth's flaws were obvious in his first full season. He should have been fired then, but we kept him on for too long and wasted those seasons. Curtin hasn't give us any indication that he is competent enough to be a manager in this league.  Jim has not shown a willingness or ability to make changes. Why was there no squad rotation during a 3 game week? Why is Andrew Wenger starting every match despite not doing jackshit this year? How come he makes the exact same subs every game? If we can predict his game plan, starting XI, and subs, opposing teams most certainly can as well.  His most successful run came when he was immediately appointed as an interim. Once teams figured his tactics out, he hasn't put up anything since. His career record is a paltry 11W - 14L - 9D good for 1.24 PPG. That is pathetically bad and has only gotten worse as this season has gone on.  Mourinho is arguably the best manager in the world. There is no reason to compare Curtin to him. Further, Fergie's departure only reinforces the point. Man U booted Moyes after one year (which I think was harsh), and the team has rebounded under a new man."
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,FlapjackJackson,7,Tue Jun 9 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"He's a young coach, and certainly has a lot of room to improve, but he's the first coach we've ever had that I feel good about.    Has nothing to do with him being a local, he's just an intelligent and hard working guy. He knows the league, he knows the game, and he knows the players well.  I would not use those words to describe Hack or Nowak.  He is to managing the Union as Pfeffer was last season to playing for the Union.  He shows signs that he can be a top quality manager, but he's learning on the job and it might be a year too soon before he will get there.    Just like Pfeffer is having a break out season this year, I really think next season could be Curtin's. Give him and Albright time to build the team closer to how they want it, and let Curtin hone in more on his tactics and mid-game adjustments and I think we'll be glad we did."
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,Dean_Moriarty,6,Sun Jun 7 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"I think there have been too many coaching changes.  They need to stick with someone for a little longer.  Curtin, has made mistakes.

PhillyUnion,38xf8c,hmpsnj,5,Wed Jun 10 14:33:18 2015 UTC,"I like him, but I sometimes wonder about his substitution and tactics choices.  I think that he makes substitutions ten to fifteen minutes later than conventional wisdom would suggest, and his attacking scheme seems strange: Aristeguieta is good, but he's not the kind of (lone) striker that I would expect to find on the roster of a counter-attacking team. Similarly, there is less pace in our midfield than I would expect for such a team. My suspicion is that the style Curtin has chosen is based more on his own preferences than on our players' strengths.  That said, I am not sure that the solution is to sack him."
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,khyleth,2,Sun Jun 7 19:06:11 2015 UTC,He's making a lot of mistakes but the only one that has really bothered me is the complete lack of squad rotation during this stretch.  It's confusing how Wenger can continue to be terrible and still not lose his spot during a 3 in 8 day span.
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,goatyhead,3,Mon Jun 8 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"He doesn't seem to have an over-arching plan for his roster. His chosen counter attacking style of play doesn't fit the team's abilities, or even those of his most recent signings. He has consistently displayed the same tactical deficiencies of poor player rotations and late substitutions. His ""I'm trusting the guys who got me the job"" favoritism is counter-productive, especially to integrate new players into the roster.   Curtin has a lot of issues. Sometimes he seems to fix them, then he makes the same mistake again. I like to think he could succeed, but he would need years under a proper coach and manager to learn from for this to happen. I don't see it coming about on his own.   Sadly, sacking him does no good as the FO will simply promote Sorber or Albright."

PhillyUnion,38xf8c,Jimmy2Tymes,7,Tue Jun 9 16:39:51 2015 UTC,"Nowak was without a doubt the best manager we ever had. He was a shitty and corrupt person, but he tactically blew Curtin and Hackworth out of the water. Nowak had a plan for this team. I can't say the same about his successors.  He should go. The results speak for themselves. Every week we are talking about the same issues of playing out of form players, failing to rotate his squad, and poor/late substitutions. Half the season is gone, and we are still talking about these issues. Clearly, he is not improving and too stubborn to recognize his flaws.  For those who say he has no depth, he is the one responsible for building this team. Perhaps he shouldn't have signed Fred as a player-coach, and perhaps he should not have kept Hoppenot. Those are two wasted roster spaces."
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:34:55 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said. Though Nowak was a shitty person he was still our best manager. He was superior to Curtin and Hackworth with tactics. Obviously he went crazy and did dismantle the team but he is still the only manager to get us into the playoffs. Yesterday was kind of my final straw with Curtin. He had no business playing same lineup for the third match in a row. I completely understand depth isn't the best but as you said that is his own fault. Le toux basically stopped making runs in the 70th minute yet he stayed in. Curtin is becoming too stubborn and needs to learn that rotation is needed along with changing tactics. I like Curtin and wish he would succeed but I really don't think he is good enough at this point in his career. It's time to get someone from outside of the organization. A lot of people say sacking him is not the answer to our problems but it is still an answer to some. We won't get a change in the front office but maybe they will finally realize we need someone from outside the organization to manage.
PhillyUnion,38xf8c,stw77,4,Mon Jun 8 00:02:49 2015 UTC,I wonder where this team would be if Nowak didn't abuse his power.

PhillyUnion,38xf8c,LocksTheFox,2,Mon Jun 8 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"He's raw. I think he might be better off as a first team coach for a year before being a full manager. Paired with Albright as a new DoF presents a lot of danger to the organization.   He's clearly done good things with coaching. The team looks organized and fit, but his subs yesterday cost us the game.   In short... he's probably the best we'll get."

Would still really like to see the 4-4-2 diamond so we can get all of our best players on the field at once. McLaughlin needs to see more time.  Couldn't really tell his actual level based on this cameo, but we need another wing option.  Give time to Jimmy and see how he develops. Pfeffer looked like one of the best players on the field once he came on. TIL Patrick Mullins is a dickhead. Fuck that guy."
PhillyUnion,38uwby,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Sun Jun 7 01:11:51 2015 UTC,Working with a two striker formation is definitely something we need to consider again.

Fernando up top with Sapong a little behind could work.

You don't see any obvious problems caused by Fabinho, but his lack of pace means he can't get forward and back too fast or too often.  Which means the LM has to have more defensive responsibilities.  Or we have to play a Carroll who is excellent at providing defensive cover, but contributes nothing offensively.  And then we end up with useless crosses into the box with only one target guy.  The thing I love about soccer is that problems are rarely caused by the obvious things: most goals are the result of midfield breakdowns, not defender mistakes.

He has earned the same number of points this camapign as Hackworth did last year when he was fired. Curtin needs to be sacked. I blame Tactics Jimmy for this result:   Any below average manager knows you need to rotate your players during a three game in one week. There is no reason than Wenger and Le Toux should have started over Ayuk and Pfeffer. How do you hold your second sub for 80+ minutes? We needed fresh legs as NYC was picking up momentum. Everyone Twitter was screaming for Ayuk. How the hell does Curtin justify not subbing him on? How is Wenger a starting player on this team? In 16 games this season, he has done jack shit. The definition of insanity: starting Wenger over and over again and expecting different results.   More often than not, I feel like I am talking about these same managerial mistakes from Tactics Jimmy. He clearly has not improved or addressed them. Last season was a flash in the pan. Teams now have tape on him, and it shows."
PhillyUnion,38uwby,FlapjackJackson,6,Sun Jun 7 01:39:18 2015 UTC,I think Sak's overall strategy is to try and time coaching switch dead cat bounces to try and get us into the last playoff spot.

PhillyUnion,38uzml,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:41:35 2015 UTC,"The issue has never been whether to keep Jim. Letting him learn as assistant has pretty much been the consensus.

PhillyUnion,38m71a,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Jun 5 17:59:37 2015 UTC,"Line from the team was ""ankle contusion,"" so it shouldn't be too bad. I'd expect him to be back Saturday, but certainly by the LA game, unless that injury report is wrong."

PhillyUnion,38m71a,drsilentg,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"I am still trying to understand what it is that others see in Aristeguieta's performance to date that would lead them believe that he is an asset to the team. He is extremely slow, he loses possession of the ball more frequently than most, his technical skills on the ball are minimal (he cannot dribble his way out of a paper bag), he is often muscled off of the ball by much smaller opposing players (invariably falling to the ground in the process), his passing accuracy and positioning are unremarkable, and most importantly, he scores very few goals. If this is the type of player that we are determined recruit and keep, then the Union is destined to remain one of the league's bottom feeders."
PhillyUnion,38koga,shelf13,10,Thu Jun 4 21:01:27 2015 UTC,Pretty funny when you juxtapose Berhalter's comments to Marsch's comments after losing to the Union.

PhillyUnion,38l27y,Allthewaylive215,2,Fri Jun 5 05:01:23 2015 UTC,I guess the only real explanation I can give is that I have been really busy with work the last 2 months and the sidebar is incredibly tedious to keep up with. This was an initial fear when discussing stuff for the sidebar a few months back when we did the redesign. I tried to make time today to do it but once again stuff got in the way. I'm gonna try to find time tomorrow to get it done while the mods discuss what to do with the sidebar.
PhillyUnion,38l27y,MrChips217,4,Fri Jun 5 05:14:49 2015 UTC,It's no problem man! I understand. I was just wondering why and now i know
PhillyUnion,38l27y,Dean_Moriarty,2,Fri Jun 5 10:13:43 2015 UTC,"Those of you who use the sidebar, what do you look for the most?    It might be better to reduce the amount of tables that need to be updated, maybe just one or two things so it is more manageable.  And have the rest just be links."
PhillyUnion,38l27y,Allthewaylive215,3,Fri Jun 5 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"i mean, local touch + more easily accessible relevant info.  upcoming game and TV channel seems most important. the Current standings is probably less important to update, but maybe a link to MLS standings instead?"

PhillyUnion,38gd4r,Keepa1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:12:58 2015 UTC,I understand how that works but those shutouts have been in huge part to the lack of shots on goal. He has made a few good saves I will have him that but we have had a game with zero shots on goal which is entirely the backline and midfield doing work.

PhillyUnion,38gd4r,akuller,10,Thu Jun 4 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"Genuinely concerned about him, not just in the immediate sense but overall. He's missed something like 30% of games since he's come here, and has come out injured a few times as well. I love his attitude and he clearly has skills, but if he can't keep healthy he's no good to anyone."
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,midwesternhousewives,4,Thu Jun 4 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"You know, I am too. Like you said, he's shown so much promise and I think he has a lot ahead of him IF and only if he can keep healthy for an extended period. I imagine it is pretty hard to go in and out of injury and still be a consistent producing forward. I really hope he gets his chance to turn that obvious ability and high work rate into goals because I really like him as a player. That said, the Union  need to do what keeps them winning because of the slow start."
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,WildGooseCarolinian,3,Thu Jun 4 01:41:52 2015 UTC,I sit right behind the bench and you should have seen him when he came off the field he was extremely pissed off that he couldn't go. He seemed to be walking ok at half time and after the game.  I think he just took a nasty kick from the defenders on that play and his leg was swelling and cramping.
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,zb313,2,Thu Jun 4 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"I was near the foul... It looked like he got him in the ankle, but I'm not sure."
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,Mike81890,0,Thu Jun 4 07:58:37 2015 UTC,"Someone showed me a tweet during the game that it was an ankle contusion, so painful, but hopefully not too serious. Psyched we won, but getting that PK called for the no-ball-all-Nando's-ankle foul that took him out would have been nice too."
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,_axaxaxax,13,Thu Jun 4 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"Marquez is fantastic. I'd love to see him and Vitoria paired while moving Mo up to Carrol's spot. With Fabinho playing in unexpected beastmode, we got ourselves a lineup...  Get well soon Nando!"
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,Allthewaylive215,14,Thu Jun 4 01:10:56 2015 UTC,I think they need Edu's leadership in defense. His calm passing and control are WAY underrated as a defender.
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,zb313,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, that's a huge reason why the defense has looked so good lately. There is no panic when Edu is back there."
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,jack_zandu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:11:33 2015 UTC,"His calm passing and control are WAY underrated as a defender.   and offensively, as he did a nice job turning that turnover into a goal lickity split. if Marquez and Vittoria can do their thing together as CBs, Edu in the midfield would help the offense a lot."
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,jpoRS,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:49:02 2015 UTC,There is no way Vitoria should be sitting on the bench though. He needs to be starting when healthy.
PhillyUnion,38gd4r,midwesternhousewives,13,Thu Jun 4 12:43:26 2015 UTC,This has to buy us at least 18th on the power rankings.

PhillyUnion,38gd4r,bterre108,6,Thu Jun 4 01:07:43 2015 UTC,soccer is W D L so 3-0-1 is correct.

PhillyUnion,38gd4r,conningcris,4,Thu Jun 4 02:16:25 2015 UTC,And tonight was pretty dead being a midweek game. But still energetic

Sounded legit excited he he got to talk about chatting up the team during the week. For someone who's not a soccer commentator day to day he was very impressive
PhillyUnion,38i8pv,Allthewaylive215,2,Thu Jun 4 12:00:37 2015 UTC,"ya, mentioned he was a season ticket holder too"
PhillyUnion,38i8pv,DeepestTruthFC,4,Thu Jun 4 16:33:21 2015 UTC,I've long been a fan of Zumoff's and last night's game was no exception. He definitely had done his homework and sounded like a legit fan (mentioning that he's a STH). Must have been nice for him to call a win for once too!
PhillyUnion,38i8pv,Dean_Moriarty,4,Thu Jun 4 14:30:23 2015 UTC,He did really well.  He's a professional and he seems to know the sport as well.

PhillyUnion,38db73,spqr-king,4,Wed Jun 3 14:01:22 2015 UTC,"The Philly Soccer Show might have convinced me we should try the narrow 4-4-2 diamond.  I had been thinking about it for awhile but didn't think we had the full backs or the CDM to make it work.  I'm not a Fabinho or Carroll fan, but can't deny they have been in good form recently so it might be a good time to try it.  The major benefit is it would allow us to get all of our best players on the field at the same time.    We could finally see Maidana, Nogueira, and Pfeffer play together, and we could get Sapong playing next to Aristegueita.  Plus the added bonus of moving Le Toux and Wenger to the bench."
PhillyUnion,38db73,Dean_Moriarty,5,Wed Jun 3 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"We just need a formation that doesn't rely on the wings, I believe it's like 60% of the reason we have been so bad this year.  EDIT: See what happens when the wingers play well. :)"

PhillyUnion,38db73,Too_many_hippos,5,Wed Jun 3 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"Hope Curtin is better with the subs this game. Ayuk and Sapong both should be out earlier and maybe even start Sapong. I think Ayuks speed, right now, is really suited to being subbed on at about minute 70. Seeing him come on in the late 80's doesn't really give him enough time to make an impact. But his fast legs vs. tired ones can help us."
PhillyUnion,38db73,jpoRS,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:49:18 2015 UTC,With Le Toux's age Ayuk should be coming in earlier and hopefully Curtin will adjust.
PhillyUnion,38db73,DrewGo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:12:30 2015 UTC,He'll have to be better with three matches in one week. The Union will get creamed by NY2 if he isn't careful with rests and subs.
PhillyUnion,38db73,TJunior1014,2,Wed Jun 3 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"Wenger and Le Toux have both looked better in recent matches, but I'd really like to see Sapong get the chance to start. I know he prefers CF to the wing, but I'd imagine he'd rather be on the field than on the bench, regardless of the position. Wenger can't finish to save his life right now, and Sapong has been able to make a huge impact off the bench. Get the man on the field."
PhillyUnion,38db73,cmills1,3,Wed Jun 3 14:26:25 2015 UTC,Wenger hits the post more than a mailman I honestly feel bad for the guy. I know they want us to ride this out but its painful to watch I hope he can catch a break. Sapong will sub for Fernando of that I have no doubt I dont think we have anyone else who can play up top and I dont know if we are set on Nando going the full 90 if we are going to be playing the type of soccer Curtin wants us to. I think we need to sub Ayuk in earlier and maybe sub in Wenger for Pfeffer rather than the other way around.

PhillyUnion,38db73,samatwing,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"The Timbers have the advantage of a better location, a sport starved market, and high demand for weekend games. The Union have none of those things. You can compare literally any franchise in this league to the Timbers and they're going to come off looking bad.   And the SoBs don't sell out every weekend anymore, so...."

It would take way too long by septa which means either I or one of my friends have to drive and not drink as much as we would like to. Fuck the traffic on 95 for weekday games. Its just that little bit extra outside the city that it's a pain in the ass. I have heard people say they would love to go to more games but they don't feel like traveling that far. Fuck it, fuck the gas, fuck the time of the drive. How can the mayor be upset that no one is spending money outside ppl park, look at your city man, there is nothing to spend money on!"

He's owned a championship team, and a sustained succesful team which is a better way to judge a manager directly. He's not known for interfering in the day to day works of the team and has brought mountains of passion to his other ownership venture. He also is extremely unlikely to think he knows the game well enough to stick his fingers in things like Sac has done. He couldnt buy the team without immediately needing a director of soccer operations and a GM to do their jobs themselves."

So I don't think too much attention should be paid to the score line.  That said, why is Wenger still starting? LeToux I can understand, but what blackmail does Wenger have and on who? If Sylvestre doesn't finish this loan with an MLS contract someone dropped the ball (not necessarily us). Is Fernando's gingerness some sort of hex?"
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,jpoRS,8,Sun May 31 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"I think Curtin thinks Wenger can get out of his slump.

PhillyUnion,37wp8m,FlapjackJackson,12,Sun May 31 01:10:46 2015 UTC,"Everyone is likely going to blame the ref who was most certainly shit. However, the ref did not:   Continue to start Andrew Wenger who was shit outside of his assist. Put CJ on 20 minutes to late and for the wrong player (Should have been Wenger) Park the bus to play for a tie when this team has the 2nd worst points per game in the league Put on Ayuk in the 88th minute. Seriously, we needed him to run at tired D.C. defenders. Fail to change the formation when things clearly were not working.   Curtin has been getting too much of an easy pass on here. With a significant chunk of the season gone, his tactical decisions are still shit. He is too damn stubborn to improve as a manager."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,rabidfrodo,3,Sun May 31 01:48:23 2015 UTC,"You find sometime the team will hire who is better I might actually try and agree with you, but they don't and won't try to. So let's move on."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,jpoRS,2,Sun May 31 02:08:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Curtin should be better, but I'm not sure we could find an upgrade. Besides, the Union have tried the ""new coach"" thing, and we're still here. Clearly something else is the problem."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,gregzorian,1 point,Sun May 31 14:02:41 2015 UTC,"I think Curtin is a little stubborn, but it seems to me that our approach of defending the middle of the field very well and also doing a decent job of preventing crosses by forcing the opponent to possess in danger-less areas has only become more effective. We have gotten better at executing it too. If you look at chances created, DC had hardly a sniff of goal in the first half (didn't watch the second half). As for the subs, I suspect that what Sapong and Ayuk bring in attack they lack in defense. Going got a point on the road to DC isn't a bad strategy. Also I wouldn't call our strategy ""parking the bus"" because altough we play defensively, we don't sit in our 18 the whole game, we defend in our half and we work hard on the counter."

PhillyUnion,37wp8m,WildGooseCarolinian,3,Sun May 31 01:40:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, the first two games of the season we actually played well but got screwed by the refs. It's just one of those years where if it isn't one thing its another."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,jpoRS,2,Sun May 31 11:05:25 2015 UTC,"Outside of the Columbus and Vancouver blowouts, the Union haven't been terribly out played all season. They haven't been a complete gimme like Chivas used to be, rather a consistent not quite good enough.  Which I think might be even more frustrating."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,WildGooseCarolinian,3,Sun May 31 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"Right.  Along with some laughably bad luck.  We get someone stringing together good performances and he gets a DUI after having his face broken.  Our striker gets his hand broken, manages to come back from surgery in time to play and then strains a hammy.  Nearly  every refereeing decision and 50/50 call goes against the union.  I mean the ref from the first week got suspended he did such a terrible job.  It's not like they're terrible, they're just not great, and that combined with the horrible luck has made everything super frustrating."

PhillyUnion,37wp8m,spqr-king,6,Sun May 31 02:08:38 2015 UTC,"There's two big problems that were highlighted last night, and both fall squarely on Curtin. I know he's in a bad position with the nature of this FO, but he needs to show some more intelligence here. The man played for a 1-0 win or a 1-1 draw, essentially parking the bus in the 6th minute after Le Toux scored.   First, Curtin keeps saying that his ""plan"" is to play counter-attacknig soccer. Now, lets think about that for a minute: a counter attack requires quick, rapid decision making through midfield. You need very effective transition play and efficient strikers, but above all else: you must be quick. Either crisp, effective passing, or pacey attacking players, the counter has to spring fast enough to generate a chance before the defense can reset, and the finishing must be efficient to finish the chances you do create.   When you look at the Union's spine you'll find we have some of the slowest players in the league through the center of the pitch: Nando, Maidana, Noguiera, and Carrol are all players you won't expect to win many foot races. They are slow players, but they are being asked to chase the game for 15-20 minutes at a time, and then quickly turn and rush into the attack. In terms of pure pace, they do not have it to be a counter attacking team.  What about their movement off the ball and their passing game? If we could string together three or four dangerous passes to set up the attack, the lack of pace might not be such an issue, but when you look at the Union's passing it is consistently worse than the opposition's and one of the worst in the league in terms of %completed passes. Not only do we lack pace, but we lack the vision to set up attackers with a killer pass. The full result is a slow, ponderous counter attack which takes too long to get through transition, takes extra touches on the ball looking for somebody to get open when the defense has already reset, and then simply turns the ball back over and jogs back to play bunker-ball again. Curtin keeps harping on our ability to counter, but the league knows the gameplan at this point and the team is not really geared to that playstyle. If we want to play that way then bring in Ayuk and Sapong and look for a better, pacey CAM.   The second issue here has got to be the subs. Too little and way too late. Wenger, while I appreciate the assist, has not had a solid game yet this year. Curtin likes to say he puts in a good shift defensively, but thats what you expect out of any player. Wenger needs to add to the attack, and he absolutely has not done so this year. The more Wenger starts, the less trust I have in Curtin to recognize when he needs to make changes to his roster. The Sapong sub needed to happen 20 minutes earlier, and for a different player. Loan Wenger out, give him a change of scenery to see if he improves his game, otherwise it may be time to move on from the Wenger-as-winger experiment.   Another issue with substitutions is showing Curtin's consistent inability to change formations as the game progresses. We got like-for-like subs last night: Sapong for Nando, Pfeffer for Wenger, and I stopped watching by the time Ayuk came on. These came too late to have any real impact anyway, but it's still frustrating to see Curtin reverting back to making the same like-for-like changes to protect what was essentially going to be loss from Pontius' goal. A draw as the second lowest team in PPG doesn't cut it.   The sad part is none of this is new. We've had these discussions ad nauseam. Is Curtin the root of the problem? No. Are the players the root of the problem? No. Do we need new ones, or do the ones we have need serious work? Yes. I still feel we have about 6-7 real starting players that are MLS-level, and that Curtin would make a good assistant coach to somebody more experienced, but until we get an FO and ownership that is willing and understands how to make these changes happen, I expect more of the same from this team."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,EdBacon,2,Sun May 31 13:15:53 2015 UTC,I think Sapong fits much better up to for what Curtin is trying to do but I think he is also very VERY defensive minded. Thats why you see Carroll and Noguiera in those back CM positions. That being Wenger is so close to breaking through I was praying for that one goal but his attack which is still apparent doesnt make up for everything else being meh. To be fair it has stopped the bleeding of goals to a point. I think Ayuk and Pfeffer have to come on sooner to have any effect on the tired legs of the opposing team. You cant expect them to mesh and get a feel for their opponent in less than 10 minutes.
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,spqr-king,2,Sun May 31 13:27:03 2015 UTC,"Sapong isn't really a starter. I feel that ideally, you would be able to bring a guy like Sapong in off the bench, and have two starting quality wingers in the XI.   In a pinch, Sapong over Wenger has to be preferred but I can't help but think that a lot of our starters would be on the  bench on better MLS sides."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,EdBacon,2,Sun May 31 13:47:36 2015 UTC,Sapong can start at striker which is his natural position. KC played him out of position and he does reasonably well but up top is his preferred location.
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,oestre24,1 point,Sun May 31 13:52:27 2015 UTC,"They played him out of position because they found a better option at striker. He could start, its just I feel there are better players at his role in MLS at either position which makes him more of a bench option to me."

We created a bunch of good chances but only finished one, so that counts as both a positive and a negative.  But a crap ref combined with dirty play, frustrating."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,jpoRS,3,Sun May 31 01:07:05 2015 UTC,I feel like a lot of people here are ignoring the quality of the Union's defense last night.  How many times did they force DC to pass all they way back. They are starting to really evolve as a defensive unit.  We were beat by a fine header (which cross should've been shut down) and a bullshit PK.   We had some decent spells of possession too.   I feel like this team has turned a corner.
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,bmangan,1 point,Sun May 31 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know about a corner, but this game certainly wasn't upsetting the same way most Union games have been upsetting this year."
PhillyUnion,37wp8m,ebradlee10,3,Sun May 31 14:08:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, outside of the context of the frustrations of this season this loss and a good performance away against the top team in the east isn't a bad thing. No matter how the seasons going, if we got four points out of the home and away with the best team in our conference we should be happy with it. This game was one weak PK call, or one less impressive save from Hamid away from that. They played DC even and both teams deserved a tie. To not be able to pull it out is frustrating, but the team we've seen these last three games would blow away the team that played Vancouver, Toronto, NYCFC and Chicago. Between Sylvestre, Fernando, Maidana and Noguiera all being added in, they look vastly improved over where we were a month ago."

Ayuk has to come on before the 89th minute there is just no way Le Toux is able to put in 100% for 90 minutes. Pfeffer needs to get over this and come back swinging as well its a mistake everyone makes them and your young no one is going to be mad about that. Fuck Chris Rolfe.
PhillyUnion,37w6cq,get_down_mrpresident,6,Sat May 30 22:18:58 2015 UTC,Pfeffer or Sapong should be starting over Wenger at this point.   I'd like to eat those words but...

PhillyUnion,37w6cq,Mike81890,1 point,Sat May 30 22:44:41 2015 UTC,A little peeved we're still starting Wenger and Le Toux. We have better options now.   I guess we'll play through the middle and keep Wenger and Le Toux playing defensive.
PhillyUnion,37vlwh,get_down_mrpresident,3,Sat May 30 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"The biggest key will be our counterattack, most notably if we even have it at all. Look at the second half of the Red Bull game, that's what they need to be doing so if they can come out doing that from the first minute I'd say there's a solid chance of a decent outcome."
PhillyUnion,37vlwh,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Sat May 30 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Really interested to see the starting lineups.

PhillyUnion,37o6xa,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Fri May 29 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"A great video wherein Kevin Kinkead does an excellent job breaking down some of the tactics from the Red Bull game and shows what's been missing from the Union all year.  That second goal is easily the best goal of the year in terms of build up and execution on the counter attack, something they did well with for most of last summer when they were actually winning games and something that has been sorely missing from this team this year."

PhillyUnion,37q1jz,thelostdolphin,-3,Fri May 29 18:48:56 2015 UTC,It's called a joke.
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri May 29 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"It wasn't funny. It was really dumb. And it potentially spreads misinformation and confusion because you didn't make the fact that it was a joke implicit in your post. Instead, you spent a lot of time (sad) making a passable photo look like Cole was really practicing with the team and then made a comment in the thread that it was taken on Tuesday.   Jokes are cool. Time-wasting worthless garbage isn't. So just delete it so it's not taking up space that could be used for things of worth.   Thanks so much."
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,thelostdolphin,-6,Fri May 29 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"Actually it is funny.  And I realize that maybe I should've made it clear that it was a joke.  But anyone who looks at this picture and thinks it is true is a joke.  It actually didn't take much time to shuffle around a couple of cropped photos and cover up a Chelsea badge, a champions league logo on the shirt and bottle and add Bimbo.  It was actually quite amusing to make this picture, especially with the speculation of an Ashley Cole move to the MLS and the unions dire need of a Left Back.  There is misinformation and confusion happening everywhere in the world, just look at the whole FIFA scandal.  There are cartoons that have been made that could cause misinformation and confusion, but to some it may bring a little light to a bad situation, just as I am trying to do with this photo."
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,Too_many_hippos,1 point,Fri May 29 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Based on the fact that your post has been downvoted to zero and all your comments are getting the same treatment, apparently most people assessed your ""joke"" as worthless time-wasting garbage, which is why it should be deleted and if you decide to attempt to make jokes in the future, make it obvious that is what it is, rather than trying your best to convince people it's real only for them to later realize they've wasted their time on someone else's steaming pile of trash."
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,puskas14,-3,Fri May 29 18:36:11 2015 UTC,I'm sorry everybody who is obviously a follower of yours is a little butthurt because of a joke they probably don't get.  Boo fucking hoo.

Faking photo and then lying in comment thread to start rumor=Dumb, worthless garbage that wastes people's time  Hopefully you're able to grasp the distinction so you don't waste anyone else's time in the future with another attempt at whatever weird thing you were trying to accomplish.   So again, please delete this post."
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,puskas14,-5,Fri May 29 18:46:31 2015 UTC,"You still are not grasping this.   I honestly thought that when people saw this picture they would truly laugh and not be so gullible as to believe Ashley Cole, Former arsenal and Chelsea!  left back, was actually training with the union.  Even though I made a comment that he was training, shouldn't negate the fact that the phillyunion subredditors are in fact gullible and don't see the humor in an obviously humorous situation that is the Philadelphia Union.  So I will delete it.  Since you don't think it was funny, because you were fooled and you are upset about being fooled."
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,ignoramis,2,Fri May 29 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"We have or have had all sorts of aging former stars in MLS. Henry, Kaka, Keane, Beckham, and on and on... Why would it be so baffling to think someone like Cole would be following suit? It's actually completely possible and he's been previously linked to MLS in rumors to begin with. It's something that could definitely happen.   A joke would be a poorly photoshopped image of Messi or Hazard in a Union jersey and then you making some silly comment in the thread to make it obvious you're goofing around.   Finding a plausible aging European former star, making a believable photo, and then bolstering your weird ruse with a reasonable story in the comments about him being seen practicing...that is not a joke. It's just really really odd, dude.    You're dumb for thinking that, in a league with all the players I listed above, that Cole would be unheard of to come here for a season or two in the twilight of his career and that anyone who would fathom that happening is somehow not as educated in the sport as you are.   Get lost."
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,LocksTheFox,-4,Fri May 29 19:14:19 2015 UTC,I never said I didn't believe Ashley Cole wouldn't make a move to the MLS.  But it is highly unlikely he will be moving to the union given our financial and DP situation.  And if he does end up in a union jersey I will shit my pants and welcome him.    I don't understand why you called my comment odd.  Are people not mislead everyday for the sake of a good laugh.  I have plenty of union fans laughing about this picture.  Because it' is funny and amusing to people who understand what's true and not.
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri May 29 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"...dunno about this. I mean we do need a LB, but this guy is 34. No saying age means a player is bad, but I wish we could bring in younger players who probably aren't at the end of their career.   If he does become a part of the team we better not throw a ton of money at him. Who knows how long he'll last?  EDIT: I should also say that I know nothing about this guy so take my comments with a grain of salt. Anyone know his pros and cons?"
PhillyUnion,37q1jz,LocksTheFox,2,Fri May 29 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"Ashley Cole was the best LB in the world for a better part of a decade.  His attack game slowed once he hit 31-32 but he is a shut down defender, both one on one and in the context of a back four.  He didn't fit in with Roma bc Garcia plays an insane pressing scheme.  He was still performing at an incredibly high level his last year with Chelsea."
PhillyUnion,37jhct,mtommyboy,3,Thu May 28 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"He struck it well but looks like the keeper dun goofed, gotta set up the wall and trust it so you can cheat to the open side."

PhillyUnion,37h961,thelostdolphin,5,Wed May 27 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"I think this is the article, and the quote in question:   “I’d call what Philly did this weekend as basically survival mode. I wouldn’t call it a game plan,’’ said Marsch   So nothing really too outlandish, but I can see why Curtin/Union wouldn't like it."
PhillyUnion,37h961,Dean_Moriarty,6,Wed May 27 17:04:34 2015 UTC,Well after all the praise Jim gave him before the match its a dick move to talk down his coaching skills. Curtin had nothing but great things to say about Marsch and their friendship and time as teammates.

PhillyUnion,37h961,thelostdolphin,4,Wed May 27 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely and it makes Marsch look like an even bigger horse's ass.

And him being a local guy makes that even more powerful, IMO."
PhillyUnion,37h961,midwesternhousewives,2,Wed May 27 17:32:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for finding that so quickly.  That's interesting considering the two of them are supposed to be friends.

Any upgrades will be via the loan system.  If any team in the UK is punching way above their financial weight it's the Cherries.    Much of their success is due to Eddie Howe.  If anything, the U should partner with them to learn how to develop into a top manager at such a young age."
PhillyUnion,37g9er,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Fri May 29 23:57:14 2015 UTC,It'd make more sense to pair up with a bigger team rather than a team who may get relegated next season.
PhillyUnion,37g9er,FlapjackJackson,2,Wed May 27 14:56:02 2015 UTC,Idk. Bournemouth did well for themselves last year. I wouldn't be surprised to see them stay up.   And... we need connections anyway even if they go back down. Their prospects are probably as good as our players anyway.
PhillyUnion,37g9er,imtellingtim,2,Wed May 27 15:26:49 2015 UTC,I don't see how we could get a bigger team to pair with us anyway. We'd probably register no better than a League 1 club to some of the big clubs
PhillyUnion,37g9er,FlapjackJackson,3,Wed May 27 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"It's a strong marketing opportunity. There is money to be had in the US.

Hell, Man U and Chelsea could use an American affiliate"
PhillyUnion,37g9er,BissAu,1 point,Wed May 27 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"We have a working relationship with stoke. They came for a friendly a couple years back and thats where we got Edu from. It not an ""official partnership"" or anything but i bet we still have decent relations with them.   I dont think big clubs like United and Chelsea need an affiliate club, what good would that do them? it would just reduce flexability in planning a preseason tour in american because they would ""have"" to play their affiliate club. They have no problem setting up matches or attracting crowds. According to wikipedia, most of the provisions in RSL's ""partnership"" with Madrid havent happened, probably because Madrid realized they could make more money playing games at bigger stadiums than Rio Tinto"

PhillyUnion,37god7,Stuie356,1 point,Wed May 27 15:17:51 2015 UTC,Yikes. Not too many fans in that stadium. Probably more Union supporters.
PhillyUnion,37d3gb,secondcitysoul,4,Tue May 26 19:17:17 2015 UTC,And Nog is on the bench.
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,gaparmer,4,Wed May 27 00:26:46 2015 UTC,He is totally contingent on Vitoria. If Vitoria gets healthy and starts doing well Marquez will be a sub and probably outcompete White in my mind. Learning from Edu and  Vitoria would be a good experience and we really need that depth on the bench. Im actually really high on him right now and hope he keeps getting starts with Edu coming back and possibly even when Vitoria comes back.
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,spqr-king,3,Wed May 27 03:46:23 2015 UTC,"There is no way Curtain can justify NOT starting Marquez over Vitoria (of course I mean - when he's healthy) right now.  The best CB tandem for this team is Edu and Marquez with either Carroll or (when healthy) Lahoud in front of them.  This lets Nogs and Chaco do their thing.  Marquez has been solid and deserves to start.  Long term, I'd lock him up if possible."
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,deadbee22,3,Wed May 27 16:46:02 2015 UTC,I'd rather start Marquez over Vitoria. He is cheaper and younger.
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Wed May 27 14:55:22 2015 UTC,Well Vitoria is going to be out for awhile with injury so we may not even retain him.
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,spqr-king,1 point,Wed May 27 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"I think a Marquez - Vitoria pairing makes the most sense with moving Mo up to DM, where he wants to be. Carroll or Lahoud should NOT be starting on this team when we're healthy. Mo is great as a CB, but if we have two good, serviceable players at CB, there is no way Mo should stay at CB while Carroll starts in the midfield. We need our best players on the field."
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,zb313,1 point,Thu May 28 13:10:13 2015 UTC,"He just turned 23 yesterday, so I'm sure they won't rush him, but if he continues to play, I'm sure he'll get his minutes.  Some have proposed a Marquez-Vitoria backline with Edu in the midfield, but there's a lot of factors to that."
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,drewuke,1 point,Wed May 27 12:23:14 2015 UTC,"Edu is worth more to the team as a CB than as a midfielder, honestly. If Marquez and Vittoria are good enough to supplant Edu..."
PhillyUnion,37ebv8,EdBacon,-1,Wed May 27 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"Marquez, Vitoria, and White all play a similar style and are big tough (a little slow) defenders. I feel like we need a complement to that style like cough cough Calos Valdes"

PhillyUnion,37e907,Dean_Moriarty,7,Wed May 27 00:05:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, so this basically means we need Blake and McCarthy for Open Cup, given Sylvestre will be cup-tied."
PhillyUnion,37e907,WJMorris3,5,Wed May 27 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"We should sign him.  Blake isn't healthy (and who know when he will be) and seems to have lingering issues with the knee, McCarthy isn't just up to MLS snuff yet."
PhillyUnion,37e907,midwesternhousewives,4,Wed May 27 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Had some luck Sunday, but he was a beast.   On a slightly unrelated note this is why you don't have to draft or spend out the ass for a keeper in MLS"
PhillyUnion,37e907,Mike81890,1 point,Wed May 27 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"Curtin, in his press conference today, said what I've had in the back of mind regarding Sylvestre, which is that he provides a calming presence on the field. He remains quietly confident and composed during set pieces and he distributes the ball so much better than McCarthy or M'Bohli under pressure, or just in general really. I hope they sign him."
PhillyUnion,37e907,thelostdolphin,4,Wed May 27 17:41:41 2015 UTC,Drop him and sign the newly free Cody Cropper. The kid needs a club and is on the mens youth team. Long term growth potential there and a player with no strings attached.
PhillyUnion,37e907,spqr-king,2,Wed May 27 12:23:43 2015 UTC,This is why we have Andre Blake. We need a backup more than a potentially expensive starter.
PhillyUnion,37e907,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Wed May 27 14:57:27 2015 UTC,Andre may never play again man at least not in the same capacity. I think its time we look past him at the moment in case that is a reality. Curtin has said that multiple times and I am wondering if he is seeing something in practice that we are not. Maybe I am just being paranoid I really like the guy but if the coach sees something going on especially after two back to back knee injuries we better find someone to fill in.
PhillyUnion,37e907,spqr-king,2,Wed May 27 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"We really don't know what will happen. It's worth giving him some games once he becomes healthy in order to identify what he has to offer. Considering how poorly we have mismanaged the goalkeeping position throughout our existence, we need to be patient for once to evaluate what we have.  Besides, it's not as though we are competing for anything this season. Use this time to evaluate Andre. If he is not the future, just wait for Zac to come back after this season. I doubt Colorado will keep him on."
PhillyUnion,37e907,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Wed May 27 15:04:07 2015 UTC,All I am saying is we are wasting minutes on a keeper we probably wont have around next season. Cropper is a prime WC class keeper looking for a home with a lot to prove. We made huge awful bets on Mbolhi and moving Zac but that doesnt mean we should sit back when opportunity arises.
PhillyUnion,37e907,spqr-king,1 point,Wed May 27 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"Again though, we aren't winning anything this year and need to focus on building for next year. Part of that means evaluating Andre to see if he is the player to move us forward. American keepers are a dime a dozen. Even if we lose out on Cropper, another good prospect will soon be available."
PhillyUnion,37e907,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Wed May 27 15:54:53 2015 UTC,Oh yea for sure I am not saying move heaven and earth but he did favorite my tweet about coming to Philly lol I think they should look into it at the very least we can put all our eggs on Andre.
PhillyUnion,37e907,spqr-king,2,Wed May 27 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"This is slightly unrelated, but I really wish we had someone like Sam Hinkie with the foresight to do a long-term build to fix this team."
PhillyUnion,37d6aa,TJunior1014,1 point,Tue May 26 19:35:51 2015 UTC,They need to take the next step to getting a new logo to go with that new stadium.
PhillyUnion,37d6aa,spqr-king,1 point,Wed May 27 03:46:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I think they need a total rebrand.  Hopefully they go full Union-affiliate.
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,spqr-king,5,Tue May 26 13:29:31 2015 UTC,"The first year he was here he played pretty well consistently. But hasn't since... Maybe he'll return to that form. I think the guy's genuinely got it in him, so I hope we see more of this Fabinho. Unless we see it consistently though... Not going to rush to any new judgements."
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,KFCConspiracy,7,Tue May 26 14:23:22 2015 UTC,I'll eat crow when he plays like that for more than one game. Even a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut.
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,Coratus,5,Tue May 26 14:14:45 2015 UTC,I have soured on/loathed Fabinho as much as anyone but he had a good game against DC United as well. He's been one of our better players in both of the last two games.
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,Invol2ver,4,Tue May 26 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"What he said everyone should know by now how we all feel about him and most would rather run with Williams/Gaddis but these past two weeks he has been a huge asset to the team especially with Edu and a few other players all but absent. He now has more assists than Wenger, Sapong, Casey, Nogs, Gaddis, Williams, Pfeffer and Nando combined gotta give credit where it is due. I am still of the mindset we need a much better LB and obviously the verdict is still out but at least we know he has some potential."
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,Invol2ver,3,Tue May 26 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would rather see Sheanon and Ray out there at LB/RB any given day because I think they take less risks than Fabinho and just generally are more consistent.  But with Fabinho being in form I don't hate the idea of bumping him up to LM/LW and sitting Wenger until he can figure himself out. I think if that were to happen you would have to drill into Fabinho that his strength is his service/distribution and not his shooting. I think he could be an assist machine over there.  I know the coaching staff has repeated that we need to ride out Wenger until he finds his form...but he has been hands-on-face bad this entire season. I don't see how we can continue to justify starting him with Ayuk and Pfeffer on the bench, and now Fabinho looking like a distribution machine."
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,KFCConspiracy,3,Tue May 26 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Sheanon play all that well for the past 2 years. Ray: I love Ray, he needs to play.   Sheanon vs. Fabinho: It was a tossup for me until the last couple games. Now Fabinho's got the edge in my opinion, especially after the RBNY game. But we'll see if he keeps it up."
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,Invol2ver,1 point,Tue May 26 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, this is my first season as a season ticket holder - seeing every single game. And last year I caught maybe 5 league games live and maybe another 10 on TV, so I haven't seen as much of Sheanon as most on here to tire of him.  In my eyes he plays hard and is serviceable, and can create some interesting problems with the long throw-in, but this is really my first season watching the team from soup to nuts.   That said I agree that Ray is indisputably one of the best/most underrated backs in the league. And if this team is going to contend down the road its going to be on the backs of people like him and a (hopefully in a few years much-improved) Zach Pfeffer. That youth core is what will lead us to the promised land, eventually. It needs to be this organization's priority to keep them on the field, keep them in Philly, and keep them developing. I really hope we can win while our current veteran core is still here, but if that's going to happen we need some key pieces (I'm looking at you Wenger...Le Toux...CJ) to find their feet and be exceptional soon."
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,jack_zandu,2,Tue May 26 19:54:51 2015 UTC,Wenger has been consistently awful then again so was Fabinho. I just dont get why we dont bench Wenger when we have such potential in Pfeffer and Ayuk. While they are getting minutes on subs which is great if Wenger needs to get it together let him do that on the bench or as a sub especially when Pfeffer is in fairly good form. The same could be said for Le Toux with Ayuk.
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue May 26 15:01:25 2015 UTC,He is also in the SI best XI.
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,beggarb,2,Tue May 26 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"I literally had a nightmare that woke me up in the middle of the night last night that Sak decided to call off the left back search because of Fabinho.  I think it would make sense that you can try him as a LM/LW sub, and if he does well there maybe see how he does in a start.  But no matter what we need to sign a LB."
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,thanksbastards,2,Tue May 26 15:59:43 2015 UTC,He gets credit for his nice run but his defense is still suspect. Shows how offensive minded these awards really are.
PhillyUnion,37bqfs,Mike81890,1 point,Tue May 26 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"I think the dude gets a bad wrap but is about average for an mls outside back. He's better in what has been Wenger's spot on the wing, but we rarely have the depth to play him, gaddis, and Williams with a decent backup option on the bench."

We our also scoring the easy goals. Everyone on the field minus Wenger is giving effort as well. Honestly I am going to attribute this to experience meshing well with youth in which we are getting an high energy organized effort that is winning matches.

PhillyUnion,3750z4,4-1-3-2,4,Tue May 26 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly we have a strong team on paper, it's just we've finally transferred it to the field the past couple of weeks so we're kind of in shock. Hope we can keep it up. PS fuck the Red Bulls, fuck New York, and fuck the Rangers too"
PhillyUnion,3750z4,DrewGo,3,Mon May 25 05:40:10 2015 UTC,I'm late but sooooo fucking happy. Leggo!!
PhillyUnion,3750z4,cuzigothye,2,Mon May 25 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"So Edu in for Carroll when he's back, right? You can't fuck with that back-line now. Casey and Ginger swap when he's back. Wenger out and Ayuk starts?  Edu in DM would give another line of protection. We're a defence-first, counter-attack team it appears. Like it or not, it has worked twice now."
PhillyUnion,3750z4,ignoramis,1 point,Mon May 25 05:20:27 2015 UTC,"Here's what I would do (assuming we get Nando back and Lahoud is still hurt) :   Fernando  Pfeffer - Maidana - Sapong   Nogueira - Carroll  Fabinho - Marquez - Edu - Williams  Sylvestre  If we still don't have Nando, Casey up top. Edu plays best as a CB, even if White and Marquez seem to have pretty good chemistry, I think you gotta stick with a true #6 in the midfield. Edu likes to get forward and play more of a #8 role when he's in the midfield, which forces Nogueira to play more defense. I dunno how long Fabinho's gonna keep this up, but if he keeps playing like this you can't bench him. Wenger has looked slightly better these past two weeks, but he's still not playing up to his potential. Le Toux seems to have lost a step and just doesn't have that goal scorer's instinct he used to, hopefully he gets it back (he's always been a streaky player) but in the meantime I think you gotta stick with guys who are scoring goals. Sapong and Pfeffer have scored in the last two games. Winger might not be their preferred positions, but they can both play out there. I'd rather see them on the field."
PhillyUnion,3750z4,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Tue May 26 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"Ever since I Tweeted Fabinho hate, he's turned his whole life around, you're welcome everyone but seriously HOLY SHIT YES I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE WON BACK TO BACK GAMES LET ALONE AGAINST DC AND NY"

PhillyUnion,3750z4,goatyhead,0,Mon May 25 06:28:50 2015 UTC,now that we are winning no one is saying shit about management.
PhillyUnion,375mp5,EdBacon,9,Mon May 25 02:14:57 2015 UTC,Two games he has played fantastic and made me wish we had a really solid LB all along. That being said it wont erase all the poor passes and missed tackles. If he can keep up his form what the hell let the man play but I have a feeling this will all come crashing down in a few weeks. If not I will be the first to admit it.
PhillyUnion,375mp5,spqr-king,7,Mon May 25 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"Won't say he's ever been one of my favorites, but Fabbi had quite possibly his best game in a Union jersey tonight!"
PhillyUnion,375mp5,Husher315,3,Mon May 25 02:23:44 2015 UTC,"His run really was amazing. For a minute I thought to myself, why doesn't he play wing over Wenger? Then I remembered the literally thousands of crosses he's put into row ZZ."
PhillyUnion,375mp5,Keepa1,4,Mon May 25 02:47:19 2015 UTC,At this point he should be starting over Wenger
PhillyUnion,375mp5,in_the_against,3,Mon May 25 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"From where I stand, his offensive threat has always been decent to good. From day one he was never afraid to throw a cross into the mixer - even doing the unthinkable and crossing early sometimes (I think we hesitate to do this way too much).   The constant problem has been his defending and decision-making. Play a team that pushes him back and puts pressure on him and you'll remember how frustrating he can be.   Hope I'm proven wrong."
PhillyUnion,375mp5,4-1-3-2,1 point,Mon May 25 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, his first game with the club he made a few threatening runs. He also came in as a LW not as a LB. Honestly Wenger may be a better defender. If Curtin decided to push Wenger back to LB, he was a highly touted defender in college, and move Fabinho up to LW, it isn't unreasonable to think it might work."
PhillyUnion,375mp5,bmangan,1 point,Mon May 25 21:45:00 2015 UTC,Fair enough - I'd sign off on that.
PhillyUnion,375mp5,4-1-3-2,2,Mon May 25 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"Not secretly, I've always been saying he should be playing and pretty sure I was the only one on this sub saying we were right to protect him. Now saying one performance proves I was right or anything but it's great to see out of him because I've seen flashes of what he could do but he's never really put it all together for 90 minutes before"

PhillyUnion,3754ou,--smokeandmirrors--,8,Sun May 24 23:31:04 2015 UTC,I've said it before and I'll say it again - Nogs and Chaco on the field at the same time is the difference with this team.
PhillyUnion,3754ou,dooper2010,1 point,Mon May 25 01:42:37 2015 UTC,Agreed.
PhillyUnion,3754ou,4-1-3-2,5,Mon May 25 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the upvote parties are moreso for just celebration. So an actual discussion based PMT is great.  -I like Richie Marquez  -Casey is old  -Le Toux was invisible  -Sapong looked good for all that time off  -Wenger needs to not  -Maidana should've scored on that 1v1"
PhillyUnion,3754ou,LocksTheFox,5,Sun May 24 23:35:54 2015 UTC,"Trap game? Today was well played and, in the second half looked like we were making astute tactical decisions to get ahead of the game.   So how consistent is this going to be? I'm still too nervous to say the team has turned a corner, but there's a lot of things to be hopeful for at least:  -Sylvestre looks like the most solid GK we've had since MacMath was given the cold shoulder. He stole a result for us tonight.   -Sapong is making a good case for starting up top or as part of an attacking trio. He has pace and good composure in the box, something which we don't see in any of our other forwards with any consistency.  The attack changed noticeably when he came on.   -Vincent and Maidana are playing well together, and this is critical. Vincent's ability to shuttle the ball through midfield and spring the attack is crucial to this team's play. Maidana's service, however, isn't always on the money, something I hope can be worked on. It seems like for every good pass he makes, two more sail out of bounds.  -Fabinho made a real case for himself on the left wing. He likes to get forward, has shown the ability to play in a decent ball, and when somebody else is covering for him at LB I will worry at lot less about his defensive liabilities. Wenger, on the other hand, is still showing his lack of confidence, or maybe just an absolute lack of creativity. Willing to take players on, but unable to think through what to do with any opportunity he creates, Wenger either needs serious coaching or a change of scenery at this point.  -Marquez really looks like the real deal at CB. White, on the other hand still makes me anxious. Carrol is not an option at midfield going forward. He can't pull 90 minutes and this is a serious issue for a CDM. He did, however, make a forward pass. Yes, you heard that right: Brian Carrol made and completed a forward pass tonight.   -Curtin made good decisions with his substitutions. I have been hesitant to say this yet, because I don't want to be disappointed, but it really looks like Curtin is learning. How successful is he going to be with the resources at his disposal, and the support he'll get from the FO is another matter. But at least I think he could be a legit coach in MLS with the right backing and experience.   What I really think we needed to see from this team was everyone coming out and showing what they can really do. The FO is a mess, the season has been a shit show so far, but for the team to give the effort we saw tonight was really heartening."
PhillyUnion,3754ou,EdBacon,3,Mon May 25 02:05:19 2015 UTC,"Sak has the summer transfer window and the next off season to win back some faith from the fans. These wins are nice but the season is long and it will take its toll as it goes on. We can play, we know how to play. Two or three intelligent signings will only improve this entire team."
PhillyUnion,3754ou,pastecity,2,Mon May 25 01:16:55 2015 UTC,So after our horrible first 1/3 of the season we're really not that far out of playoff contention... Yes the teams around us have games in hand but if we turn this 2 game winning streak into some momentum going forward we could be right in the thick of the playoff hunt!
PhillyUnion,3754ou,MettaWorldPeach,2,Mon May 25 04:01:43 2015 UTC,"And teams are catching up on games in hand. New England is already caught up, DC will be at 13 when we see them Saturday, and NY2 and Orlando are just one behind."
PhillyUnion,3754ou,jpoRS,1 point,Mon May 25 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"Also, take into consideration that the Union should have had 3 more points if it wasn't for a horrible penalty call very late into a sealed up game."
PhillyUnion,3754ou,SubClavianGroove,1 point,Tue May 26 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"it's a little alarming how we were completely unable to killers that game off with 10 minutes to go. We were poorly organized but I'm glad we were able to hang on.   I really love what we can do with our midfield. Edu, Nog, Maidana, and Pfeffer are all starting quality. Carroll isn't the worst option to have as a CDM as well.  Wide players continue to concern me, although Wenger and LeToux's work rate really help shield our weak fullback play. With Gaddis back I'd like to see our CMs rotate into that space to add a bit more fluidity and creativity to our play. It's worth experimenting with.  Casey (and Fred) should really never see the field.   Ayuk deserves a shot at starting.  I have no idea what to make of our CBs. They typically are poorly positioned and unorganized, but I suppose we'll just  have to hope they'll be able to figure it out as our season progresses."
PhillyUnion,3754ou,southerngangster,2,Sun May 24 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"it's a little alarming how we were completely unable to killers that game off with 10 minutes to go.   To be fair, Pfeffer did see an agonizingly close offside call negate a third goal. Felt like that was too close to call off, advantage for the attacker and all that."
PhillyUnion,3754ou,keystone_union,1 point,Mon May 25 00:53:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like the pieces are falling into place. Sapong will add to the attack and our defense is coming together to keep pressure off of the keeper making things manageable. With Fernando back up top, Sapong starting as well as Pfeffer for Wenger we can be dangerous if our defense holds. I think Carroll is doing poorly but he may be the glue holding the back line together im not sure he has been in both games where the defense performed well."
PhillyUnion,3754ou,spqr-king,1 point,Mon May 25 00:19:36 2015 UTC,"I like Curtin's attitude.  I don't know if you guys caught the post-game reactions, but he ends it with ""but again, it's 2 wins"".  He's obviously not thrilled and not ready to celebrate yet.    I think people shit on Carroll harder than they should, while not a long term solution, he was in both games we won, and if you watch him, he does provide an important part of the defense.    Hopefully the U will keep up the momentum.   I'll be in DC for the game, but will be sitting in the DC supporter section due to my DC friends being fans.  I fully intend to wear a Union jersey again... Wish me luck.   I did this once before last season.  People mostly flipped me off."
PhillyUnion,37574c,tbrun08,5,Sun May 24 23:53:24 2015 UTC,Dude how did you get this insider video of Curtin's postgame locker room speech??
PhillyUnion,374l0y,spqr-king,9,Sun May 24 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"Bring him back and if he doesn't want to play, let him spend his career on the bench. No mercy anymore."
PhillyUnion,374l0y,TomCosella,4,Sun May 24 21:47:10 2015 UTC,Only problem with that is him taking up cap space. I would agree if the cap weren't so stringent.
PhillyUnion,374l0y,--smokeandmirrors--,6,Sun May 24 22:25:21 2015 UTC,Didn't he already burn down that bridge?
PhillyUnion,374l0y,TheSublimeLight,4,Sun May 24 20:54:13 2015 UTC,If he comes back i hope we boo the shit out of him. He's  a waste of cap space.
PhillyUnion,374l0y,_axaxaxax,2,Tue May 26 16:31:23 2015 UTC,It was a loan he could come back.
PhillyUnion,374l0y,EdBacon,4,Sun May 24 20:55:01 2015 UTC,"Plz no. He is expensive and takes up an international spot. Can we just move on already?   Between Edu, Vittoria, and Marquez we have three CBs I'd be comfortable with starting. If we got a new LB that'd leave Williams as depth as well. We don't need an expensive CB with baggage. Sell him and M'Bolhi and focus on real areas of need."
PhillyUnion,374l0y,wannabebullwinkle,1 point,Mon May 25 02:10:11 2015 UTC,If we could drop him off on a team with a solid LB we could have a win win here. Maybe NYCFC looking to splash some cash?
PhillyUnion,374l0y,LocksTheFox,1 point,Mon May 25 03:04:39 2015 UTC,Has he even been playing?  Would an MLS team actually want him?
PhillyUnion,374l0y,dekelly,1 point,Wed May 27 22:17:11 2015 UTC,He was playing in South America and he has a good reputation as a player in terms of skill level he just hated Philly as far as I know. He would probably do well at a team like NYCFC where he can try and be a star player which is a joke but thats his mentality.

PhillyUnion,374ibg,spqr-king,2,Sun May 24 20:19:24 2015 UTC,"i simply do not understand why pfeffer does not play 90 minutes for this team. ditto ayuk. Ok, leaving him as a super sub is fine, but Pfeffer + Nogueira + Maidana = ball control, and I actually think Carroll has been really good at getting in the way of passes, he just needs to give someone the ball quickly after intercepting because he can't get far himself or maintain possession.  At this point, why aren't they trying Wenger at LB? I know Fabinho had a nice cross and all, but Wenger at LB could also be an offensive threat in transition and maybe it would be a wakeup call OR shore up the D.  Sub predictions if leading: Pfeffer for Wenger @ 60M, Fred for Maidana @ 65, Ayuk for Casey @ 75."

PhillyUnion,37315o,drsilentg,1 point,Sun May 24 12:43:30 2015 UTC,Honestly I dont think the senior line will have the speed to assist our backline that will be without Edu. NYRB have not given a lot of goals we have given the most goals having a defensive mid and attacking on the counter will really be our best shot at this.
PhillyUnion,37315o,drsilentg,3,Sun May 24 14:04:36 2015 UTC,"White is going to have to step up, he has good games and bad games. When he has a bad game, they are really bad......"
PhillyUnion,37315o,drsilentg,1 point,Sun May 24 14:39:18 2015 UTC,Honestly I am thinking this match will revolve around Carroll and Nogs if they can keep possession but also support our defense at all times we could move up the field with Sapong and Pfeffer. If Wenger plays im going to shut off my television.
PhillyUnion,37315o,drsilentg,1 point,Sun May 24 15:18:07 2015 UTC,Sapong and pfeffer combo sounds nice. Le toux did better last week too. I still like ayuk as a super sub to bring some energy

Nog should be back, so he might be able to pick up some of the slack Mo will have left, but we'll probably see BC, probably wearing an arm band. And that just isn't good enough.

PhillyUnion,36rfy0,TweetPoster,3,Thu May 21 15:12:33 2015 UTC,Glad to have him back and I hope he has learned from his mistakes. A dui is a serious offence and he's lucky no one got hurt.   Time to move on CJ and get back to work.
PhillyUnion,36rfy0,Too_many_hippos,6,Thu May 21 15:45:58 2015 UTC,I'll buy him a beer if he scores a goal

PhillyUnion,36rfy0,gaparmer,-1,Thu May 21 19:34:44 2015 UTC,I don't know... not throwing CJ to the Union graveyard of talented players no longer with the team... like what ever happened to Jorge Perlaza?
PhillyUnion,36rfy0,TomCosella,-6,Thu May 21 23:37:42 2015 UTC,I don't care.  I don't want him playing.
PhillyUnion,36rfy0,MrChips217,14,Thu May 21 15:27:10 2015 UTC,"People make mistakes and nobody knows what occurred that night. Could have had one to many, could have been a bad mix with his scripts, could have been a complete and stupid error of judgement on his part. By doing what he did he very well could have put lives in danger and I know that is wrong, but to rob him of his career and not give him a chance at redemption after he did what he was told per the league and ,soon, by police is just harsh. You live and you learn and while his actions hurt this team, I still believe that CJ deserves a shot (on the pitch)."

While I agree with your statement about supporting people acting like shitheads, I think people do deserve another chance as well.    Yes, it was a shithead, boneheaded, fucking stupid asshole thing to do, but hopefully he learned from it.  If he does it again, I too am done with him.  But your reason is completely valid and doesn't deserve downvotes.  I know plenty of die-hard eagle fans who fucking hated vick for the same reason."
PhillyUnion,36sj79,EdBacon,11,Thu May 21 19:46:10 2015 UTC,Sounds like it would be two very stupid moves if they pan out.

PhillyUnion,36homl,spqr-king,14,Tue May 19 13:44:03 2015 UTC,Didnt SOB strictly state that they wanted to support the players while conveying their distaste for the front office? Secondly we are not a young organization sure in terms of global soccer we are but in terms of the MLS other teams have seen success much faster than we have and havent had nearly as many issues. Hell two first season teams are drawing larger crowds and one is doing better than we are.   Finally the business side of the Union may be doing great for their bank account but if the fans are seeing unpaved parking lots and failed six month searches for new coaching and staff positions how are we supposed to feel? Sure the beer garden is great and new practice fields always help but spending where it matters like a sporting director is what is going to make fans feel like the team is going somewhere other than into the dirt.
PhillyUnion,36homl,EdBacon,12,Tue May 19 13:52:49 2015 UTC,"Let's play a game: Translate Nick Sak's Statements  I'll start  “We wholeheartedly agree with the Sons of Ben, that we all deserve more from all the commitment and hard work put into the Philadelphia Union over the last five years,”  translation: we recognize that the fanbase is dissatisfied, but we're not going to do anything about it.   “We’re a very young club but expect a lot more and our great fans deserve it.""  translation: We're not going to invest much in this franchise, but here's an excuse for our poor performance.   ""At this moment, it’s most important to support and assist the players, Jim, his staff, and the organization, and not point fingers at me or any one individual that is part of our organization.""  translation: We need you to keep coming to games to buy tickets and merchandise. Also protests are negative and hurt my feelings. Please, no more of those.

PhillyUnion,36homl,EdBacon,-10,Tue May 19 15:57:38 2015 UTC,I wonder how many times we can make the same post! So far I'm counting 3 in the past day! What a flavorful community we are beating the dead horse!
PhillyUnion,36ist9,OshiHidra,9,Tue May 19 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"All these arguments seem to stem from the word ""deserve"". Do we deserve a consistently winning team? Maybe. I mean we pay for tickets, jerseys, season tickets, parking, etc. You would hope that means we get a team where all that money is used to improve the quality on the field.  But to me the word ""deserve"" wasn't aimed at the team, but at the FO. What we do deserve is an FO that is transparent about their decisions, a FO that talks to the fans and explains it's plans for the team and its future.. We've had a few press releases from Sak the past few days and can you even remember or tell what he's saying in all those words and paragraphs? I sure can't besides that ol' ""We're upset too and we promise to improve"" which is something I think every sports team in the world says. It's not personal it's just generic and feels a tad insulting.  We deserve a statement and a talk with our FO, we deserve communication. Not because we pay money to watch and support our team and it's players. But we deserve something like that because it's just a nice and courteous thing to do for the fans of any sport team. I bet fans wouldn't be as outraged as they are with Sak and the FO if they just talked to us instead of hiding, leaving us to guess at and insult their decisions."
PhillyUnion,36ist9,Too_many_hippos,5,Tue May 19 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"Totally misses the point, dunnit."
PhillyUnion,36ist9,4-1-3-2,5,Tue May 19 21:53:07 2015 UTC,"How is that even an argument... This is a professional organization trying doesnt mean shit winning and getting things done is what matters. Even if we didnt win matches growing the fan base, getting the proper staff, improving the team incrementally all these things would help but none of them seem to happen. No other company in the world would let a CEO blow this many tasks and still be heading the company it just wouldnt happen. We spend money to support the team we are not entitled to anything but I would say we at least deserve some fucking effort. Soccer gods what a joke."
PhillyUnion,36ist9,spqr-king,7,Wed May 20 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"He's got a point. He just missed the point of the protest. Bless his heart, Nicky Sak is actually trying; that's exactly why we want him out.  If the Union were an anime, it'd be called My Team's CEO Can't Be This Inept!"
PhillyUnion,36ist9,EdBacon,2,Tue May 19 18:40:20 2015 UTC,And all the players would be girls.
PhillyUnion,36ist9,Mike81890,3,Tue May 19 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people are taking this as such an affront. The condescension from this video and from the public at large make no sense to me. Are they saying that this would be justified if we waited longer? How many years of sucking (as the guy in the video says) justify being upset?  If you don't think the Union ""deserve better"" that's fine, and I'm all about differing opinions, but why is this such a laughingstock? I don't get it."
PhillyUnion,36g5bf,Mountainhawk98,10,Tue May 19 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"As you said, the games in hand, but the real insanity is that the Union have literally played twice the amount of games as Montreal.

PhillyUnion,36g5bf,Dean_Moriarty,3,Tue May 19 03:27:54 2015 UTC,The Impact had 2 or 3 games rescheduled due to weather/CCL.

PhillyUnion,36g5bf,smiddysmash,5,Tue May 19 05:09:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, fuck MLS's completely whack scheduling. It's so hard to get a sense of how to look at the table. We've played DOUBLE the number of games that Montreal has. Even being 3 games ahead of Chicago and Toronto is completely ridiculous."
PhillyUnion,36g5bf,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Tue May 19 05:50:33 2015 UTC,"While I agree, they definitely gave Montreal some leeway so they can focus on the CCL, which I actually think is fair and like.  It means the MLS is supporting their clubs in other competitions.  That being said, yes, I don't like how many we played already compared to every other team.  As crappy as it is though, it's the Union's fault they're in as deep of a hole as they are in.  We could have a lot more points and be comfortably sitting at the top right now."
PhillyUnion,36g5bf,spqr-king,2,Tue May 19 16:49:54 2015 UTC,Well Montreal had CCL in the way so if they do well they could potentially own the division. The good news is not all of the teams are so far behind us in terms of games played the bad news is we lost to some of the teams that really mattered in our division that could have helped us and at home.
PhillyUnion,36g5bf,EdBacon,2,Tue May 19 11:56:31 2015 UTC,"PPG is the only worthwhile metric at this point, seeing as some teams in the Eastern Conference have played half as many games as the Union. And by that metric we are not doing well."

He's talking like the playoffs are still a viable goal for this year. In what world has his deluded mind gone? At this point our team goal should be to finish in the upper half the East and try to win half our remaining games. It's ambitious for us but achievable, the playoffs are not realistic."

PhillyUnion,36ddqr,EdBacon,4,Mon May 18 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I realized now how short sighted some fans can be.  The goal isn't making the playoffs and losing because we barely edged our way in. It's about having a team that's built on a soild foundation of support from their supporters, Coach, trainers and support staff as well as the owner and front office staff. This teams current ownership does not understand that which is wholly apparent in the open letter from Nick. It shows just how out of touch he is, or perhaps realizes how much people want him gone so that's his only other response available."

PhillyUnion,36e4h2,EdBacon,12,Mon May 18 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"I still think we are a solid team if everyone is healthy and everyone is avaialble.  And I think we could actually be good and make a late run for the playoffs as long as we don't dig too big a whole and if we are able to transfer M'Bolhi and sign a quality left back and a CDM.  I don't think Sak is OK, but I don't think he necessarily has to go.  As long as he focuses on the money side of things and stays away from the player side like they said was now the case at the beginning of the year.  And given what's happened with M'Bolhi, I'm inclined to beleive that might actually be the case.    It's just that we are still feeling the affects of his previous poor decisions combined with a rash of injuries that things had gotten so bad this season.  Also, I hope it is just coincidence that the year we finally get a training facility is the same year we've had so many injuries, many occurring during training.   Also, I still believe in Wenger.  His head is all messed up and confidence shot.  He would benefit from one or two games off, then slowly being worked back in. He would also benefit from playing in front of a quality left back."

What do you like about Sak, and who do you think is to blame for the constant failing of this franchise?    My bizarre opinion:  I think Conor Casey and Carroll still have some years left in them.  They are able to go out and make an impact, and Carroll has been playing well the games he started.  In addition, he definitely has a leadership role, and even though Edu is captain, when Carroll is out there I hear him take charge.  Case in point: I was at the game last night, and after the union scored and everyone was still celebrating and not paying attention as DC was kicking off, Brian was yelling at the team to pay attention, and make sure to push up and keep the ball in DC's half still and not make any dumb mistakes."

Wenger/Le Toux/Williams are trying to play more direct to Casey/Fernando and run in behind or out wide for crosses. So half the team is playing one offensive strategy, the other half is attempting the other, neither is clicking, then they get caught totally out of sorts and all seem god awful slow and have no idea where they're are supposed to be coming back on defense because they had no clue where they're dosed to be on offense to start.

PhillyUnion,36b8nw,CoffeeNut22,4,Mon May 18 01:38:55 2015 UTC,He has been not so great all season bench him and use him as a sub. He has a lot of potential but is in a world of his own for some reason.

PhillyUnion,36auj2,Timothy-H,13,Sun May 17 21:38:57 2015 UTC,I love how it comes from the one person no one wants to hear from.
PhillyUnion,36auj2,EdBacon,11,Sun May 17 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"So... wait, is he trying to get on our side??  ""Oh yeah I totally feel you guys! I'm disappointed too. Well, I've given all the resources available to Jim and the gang, let's hope he can pull it together!""  What the actual fuck, Nick? How about showing some goddamned responsibility for once?"
PhillyUnion,36auj2,EdBacon,6,Sun May 17 22:05:56 2015 UTC,Like we are just going to forget who talked up Mbolhi the entire time and spend DP money on a player we didnt need in a position we had covered at least in some capacity.
PhillyUnion,36auj2,goatyhead,6,Sun May 17 22:07:49 2015 UTC,Nick has shown an amazing ability to ignore reality and make up his own story for how things happened.   Ask him about his time at Nantes if you want to see what I mean.
PhillyUnion,36auj2,oooooooounbelievable,10,Sun May 17 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"This is some seriously insulting bullshit.  I didn't pay my hard earned cash and 90' commute to games to hear platitudes from some narcissistic little prick.  The likelihood of anything changing in the remaining months of this season is nil. Zero. Zilch. If there was any intention to act like a professional organization we'd have seen it by now.  Former players wouldn't be talking about the lack of basic necessities like training fields and nutrition plans. And the fact we  have a ""supporters""  group so beholden to the fo that they won't bring their protest into the one place where it actually matters doesn't help."
PhillyUnion,36auj2,marble617,8,Mon May 18 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"words. this means nothing, so nothing will change."
PhillyUnion,36auj2,--smokeandmirrors--,4,Sun May 17 21:39:02 2015 UTC,"This isn't the start of the season anymore, sak. We're mostly mad at you for the shit that's happened in the last month. Well that and the beginning of the season. And last season. And the one before that. Please just fuck off somewhere."
PhillyUnion,36auj2,Dean_Moriarty,3,Sun May 17 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"I'll believe it when we get more money invested in the team, paved parking lots, actual training facilities, a GM, and Sak to sell his portion of the team to someone who wants to build an actual team.  So."
PhillyUnion,36auj2,leftyboy87,5,Sun May 17 22:48:03 2015 UTC,Well coordinated.
PhillyUnion,36auj2,CheckYesJewliet,6,Sun May 17 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"Are you implying a supporter's group that has ties to the organization would create a protest that does nothing beyond generate pictures, and then coordinate with said organization to get an immediate response?  Hmm."
PhillyUnion,36auj2,4-1-3-2,2,Sun May 17 22:55:44 2015 UTC,"It's not surprising that the communication staff wanted to issue a formal response so that the news did not get ahead of the organization. Now I don't think that we can trust words from the team anymore especially the front office, but it is hardly surprising that the statement came out as quick as it did. To think it was coordinated it with the front office is just outlandishly stupid. They protested in a way that they knew would get the front offices attention."
PhillyUnion,369oe5,LocksTheFox,7,Sun May 17 15:23:06 2015 UTC,SoB doing the absolute bare minimum to show they're paying attention to the rest of the fanbase.
PhillyUnion,369oe5,EdBacon,14,Sun May 17 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to post what I said in the other thread.  It has zero chance of affecting any sort of positive change. It's an eminence front, it's a put on.  It's more just as if they are saying, see, we aren't really in bed with the FO, than it is demonstration to actually accomplish anything.   The banner will not make its way into the stadium as inside PPL is where we show our support for our team. That support will not change - win, lose or draw.   Weak, that's the problem right there. To use a word I just learned the other day in a thread about Norm MacDonald and Letterman, SOB leadership is a bunch of quislings."
PhillyUnion,369oe5,Dean_Moriarty,7,Sun May 17 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely correct. As I said in the other thread, this is one of the main reasons I left the SoB. They function more as an arm of the FO than an actual independent supporters group."
PhillyUnion,369oe5,JawsJVH,10,Sun May 17 20:34:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't get it. I don't think any one would take a protest banner as disrespect to the team. Every one understands that we suck right now even the players know.   If they want to do something that will affect change then tonight was the time to do it and it needs to be done in the stands so that it can be seen on national TV.

PhillyUnion,3674e8,drewuke,8,Sat May 16 21:16:21 2015 UTC,Cmon Union score a goal I wish it was that simple Pick the ball out of the net And try again better next time
PhillyUnion,3674e8,gameface247,4,Sun May 17 12:51:57 2015 UTC,Should have started Catic up front Casey and LeToux have proven fairly useless and new blood couldnt hurt rather than sending him to the Railhawks unless that was contingent on the Sylvestre deal. Looking like a recipe for disaster folks.
PhillyUnion,3674e8,spqr-king,1 point,Sat May 16 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"Curtin ought to just see what he has in the younger guys like Catic and McLaughlin. Identify what talent we have and then make up the list for who to cut in the off season.   It pains me to say it, but its not like the Union could develop talent anyway."
PhillyUnion,3674e8,EdBacon,1 point,Sun May 17 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"Well we have developed some of them this far. I just feel like with our current roster we would be better off having raw talent and stamina then old tired legs and experience. Our experienced players were never really superstars to begin with so you cant really argue that they have a massive amount of talent if we had a Lampard, Villa, or hell even a Pontius sure that makes sense but Casey and Le Toux are so far off in terms of skill level it doesnt make sense to me. I would rather see what the young guns can do and take a chance than see the same thing we have seen the first quarter of the season. Dont get me wrong I respect our vets but nothing will change doing what we are doing."
PhillyUnion,3674e8,spqr-king,1 point,Sun May 17 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"My main concern is even if you find some kids with the raw talent, like Ayuk, I just don't trust the Union enough to actually be able to develop that into anything. We don't have the technical and coaching staff around to support real player development on the professional level. And their relationship with HCI is becoming more and more of a joke. None of the younger guys are getting consistent time in Harrisburg either. Why is Catic starting behind Hoppenot? They're playing their older guys as well. Not like HCI will probably even be around next season, but still. The whole thing... I just have very little faith in it."
PhillyUnion,3674e8,EdBacon,1 point,Sun May 17 21:06:37 2015 UTC,I can agree with that we need a USL team with our youth getting consistent minutes. It seems like our academy system is doing well then it all falls apart at that early 20 age where they can't get minutes on the U and can't start anywhere else.
PhillyUnion,3674e8,spqr-king,4,Sun May 17 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"I have a good feeling about tonight. I don't know why exactly, but Id say we at least get a point tonight."
PhillyUnion,3674e8,Timothy-H,3,Sun May 17 12:19:24 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked if they score a goal. I doubt I'll even bother watching. It just isn't worth it.
PhillyUnion,3674e8,CouldBeBetterForever,1 point,Sat May 16 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"I'll watch from the safety of my home, grill firing and beer in hand. Only way I can think of to enjoy the game."
PhillyUnion,3674e8,JerseysFinest,2,Sun May 17 15:26:39 2015 UTC,GK: Sylvestre  DF: Lee-White-Edu-Gaddis  DM: Nogueira-Williams  AM: Fabinho-Maidana-Ayuk  ST: Casey  This team is a trainwreck.
PhillyUnion,3674e8,TheDuckyNinja,3,Sat May 16 21:25:54 2015 UTC,We would lose this game 8-0...
PhillyUnion,3674e8,drewuke,2,Sat May 16 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"It's not my fault this team doesn't actually have 10 outfield players who remotely fit in together.  This is who we have available tomorrow (note that it's only 17 players, and that's including the pool keeper):  (3) FWD: Casey, Le Toux, Wenger  (7) MID: Ayuk, Carroll, Fred, Edu, Maidana, Nogueira, Pfeffer  (5) DEF: Gaddis, Lee, White, Williams, Fabinho  (2) GK: Silvestre, Pool Keeper  Of the 15 outfield players, 4 are not remotely MLS-quality (Lee, Fred, Fabinho, and Carroll).  5 more are either simply bench-quality guys or just completely without confidence right now and shouldn't be starting (Wenger, Le Toux, Casey, Williams, White).  That means we have 6 guys.  We can stick Gaddis at RB.  Edu has been awful in the midfield, so let's stick him at CB.  Ayuk has settled in nicely at RM, let's not mess with that.  Pfeffer, Maidana, and Nogueira are also attacking mids.  Maidana and Nogueira do not stay at their assigned position, but let's call Maidana LM and Nogueira CM.  Let's put Pfeffer at CAM.  You now have a CM who can't defend and doesn't stay central, a LM who wants to be central, and a CAM with nobody to link with.  That's a mess as it is.  And that's before we try to fill in striker, CDM, or the other two back spots.  I'd rather throw a lineup out there that has some semblance of potentially working well together than our 10 best guys, because quite frankly, we don't have a ""10 best"" right now."
PhillyUnion,3674e8,TheDuckyNinja,2,Sat May 16 21:58:00 2015 UTC,"If Nogs and Maidana both start we'll have a chance - they've barely been on the field together this year.   Edit:  good call me, pats self on back"

PhillyUnion,3674e8,AbsentEmpire,2,Sat May 16 23:51:52 2015 UTC,"I still have a corrupt kind of faith. I don't think this team is as bad as it's record and I think they're closer to being good league average than people are giving them credit for.   But, just like last week- it's up against a rather good team. DC winning against a good team wouldn't be a shock, and the Union are not a good team."

PhillyUnion,3674e8,SansSelf,2,Sun May 17 14:05:59 2015 UTC,I predict a 5-1 blowout and another Union loss.

PhillyUnion,362s5k,EdBacon,28,Fri May 15 16:46:38 2015 UTC,First article out of the local sports media that pretty much asks for Sak to step aside.
PhillyUnion,362s5k,Too_many_hippos,22,Fri May 15 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"We need more sports articles that say stuff like this. Everyone calls for Curtin's firing and how bad all the players are, when it's not really 100% their fault. The majority of the problem lies in Sak and Sugarman. When we go through this many players, goalkeepers, and managers it's obviously something or someone higher up that is the cause of all the problems."
PhillyUnion,362s5k,keystonemike,8,Fri May 15 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think the people calling for Curtin's head have a bit of truth... He has done some puzzling things, and the team is very disorganized coming from a defensive coach. BUT that is to be expected from such a young and inexperienced HC.  What's more puzzling is that he was the product of a ""global search."" Like you said, there is a systematic failure within the organization. Needs a total overhaul."
PhillyUnion,362s5k,thewizardofosmium,5,Fri May 15 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"I always wonder if we looked at a Canadian or someone coaching in Canada.  Because then they could claim an ""international"" search the same way the Lehigh airport is an ""international"" airport."
PhillyUnion,362s5k,Mike81890,2,Sat May 16 01:17:57 2015 UTC,Even Curtin's failings come from the FO. If you're going to bring in an inexperienced coach you'd better have solidity everywhere else around the club. If you don't even know which 18 players you're going to put on the field how can any coach be expected to succeed?
PhillyUnion,362s5k,Too_many_hippos,1 point,Sat May 16 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"Agree about Curtin, he's young, inexperienced and like the article said he might be a bit in over his head with this new position of his. I think that, combined with the quality of our players, and our FO just makes this the worst franchise in the MLS at the moment."
PhillyUnion,362s5k,midwesternhousewives,4,Fri May 15 18:07:44 2015 UTC,On the plus side tickets are really cheap....

PhillyUnion,362s5k,Dean_Moriarty,3,Sat May 16 12:57:44 2015 UTC,"I think it will be much easier for the Union to turn things around just given that nature of MLS.  DCU set an all-time bad record and then won the East the following year (or something like that).    Not that we should expect that, but if Sak is truly not making player decisions anymore, and once we got M'Bolhi off the books they should then have some room to work with and improve.   While it appears the Phillies have zero talent in their system.  Even if they spend the next year or two acquiring top prospects somehow, and eventually making good free agency signings or trades, I can't see the Phillies being a relevant team in MLB for like 4 more years."
PhillyUnion,362s5k,BissAu,2,Fri May 15 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"They're (phillies) finally overhauling the farm system, maybe the unions academy will start pumping out talent in a few years..we do have some type of academy right? Lol"

PhillyUnion,35wecv,akuller,8,Fri May 15 04:31:12 2015 UTC,"You know, through all of this I feel the worst for Blake. Granted, some fairly major injuries haven't helped his situation, but what a bad draw for him. He comes out of college as the #1 keeper (and arguably a top 5 draft pick regardless of who had the first pick) and gets picked up by a team that can't get their shit together for more than a week. He's one of four to five keepers on any given day, and when he's finally healthy will probably get shafted again."
PhillyUnion,35wecv,drumlogan,4,Thu May 14 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"He isnt healthy... He just injured his other leg thats why we got Sylvestre from the Rail Hawks or else Blake would be starting. I agree though his story is tragic so much potential and none of the problems he is having are really his fault. He is going to miss representing his nation, his team that he has waited to start for, and on top of that who knows where he will be when he recovers. This guy is busting his ass to be a professional athlete and he cant catch a break."

PhillyUnion,35wecv,ignoramis,1 point,Thu May 14 18:56:46 2015 UTC,Start McCarthy if he can and start the search for a real keeper. Someone in their late 20s early 30s who is a proven shot stopper and can teach McCarthy to be our number one of the future if we really are so set on not using Zack. If we somehow pulled a keeper like Guzan who is rumored to be out of favor for the right price it would increase the quality of our team for at least 3-5 seasons in which McCarthy could develop.
PhillyUnion,35wecv,spqr-king,7,Thu May 14 13:03:34 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not that impressed with McCarthy. I think Blake has a lot more up side than McCarthy... The only thing McCarthy has going for him is they're trying to make him out as some kind of home town hero for some reason; gotta wonder what that relationship is with the front office.... Some complete unknown is getting all this hype.
PhillyUnion,35wecv,KFCConspiracy,3,Thu May 14 13:06:52 2015 UTC,McCarthy was the USL keeper of the year last season so its not like he was a complete unknown and he got a lot of hype because of the win in his first start.  But no one would have expected him to get any minutes with the Union this year and I don't really think he's MLS level right now.
PhillyUnion,35wecv,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Thu May 14 18:19:50 2015 UTC,I think Blake is a better keeper as well but blake will be out for 3 months... Unless we want to start Sylvestre and get an extended loan we have to start McCarthy. I think Sylvestre played well but I dont know how long the Rail Hawks are willing to let their keeper sit over here and if we are not keeping him those are minutes McCarthy could develop. Im not high on McCarthy but at this point its not going to hurt us in the long run especially if Blake cant come back from this.
PhillyUnion,35wecv,spqr-king,1 point,Thu May 14 13:10:22 2015 UTC,"What I'm getting at is I don't think McCarthy is a long term goalie for us... Who knows in 3 months he may change my mind, but based on what I've seen so far..."
PhillyUnion,35wecv,KFCConspiracy,2,Thu May 14 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"I hope Third String Local never plays again. He's awful. I hope the Union do everything they can to extend the Sylvestre loan. Blake is the future, not McCarthy."
PhillyUnion,35wecv,HandsomePete215,3,Thu May 14 19:21:54 2015 UTC,"McCarthy is a great story, but literally anything can pull him off his line, which is a problem.  He's not a freaking 5th defender."

PhillyUnion,35wecv,spqr-king,1 point,Thu May 14 19:53:36 2015 UTC,How are we saying Blake is the future? Because he was a #1 pick? Because he showed well in college? Sounds like a road we've been down before

PhillyUnion,35wecv,KFCConspiracy,2,Fri May 15 13:26:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure there's another shitty local keeper out there for them to trot out.
PhillyUnion,35wecv,HandsomePete215,2,Fri May 15 14:21:51 2015 UTC,I hear the goal keeper off of my PSN team is a home town hero.

PhillyUnion,35ukkd,Dean_Moriarty,2,Wed May 13 17:13:56 2015 UTC,Yea Curtin didnt say it but thats pretty funny honestly. His agent probably just assumed with all the injuries we would need him and went ahead with it.

PhillyUnion,35vmym,SmugMacGyver,2,Sun May 17 16:14:36 2015 UTC,I knew he had an injury and was training to come back from it.  I didn't know he got reinjured. I'm a fan from NC so I don't get as much news either
PhillyUnion,35vmym,SmugMacGyver,-1,Sun May 17 20:19:26 2015 UTC,It's right from their facebook posts. I don't know if you need someone to spoon feed for you news but the article as posted in this sub as well. I might come off bitchy but I'm tired of people talking about stuff like they've done their homework or keep up with team news. If you have time to bitch on here at least get you news in beforehand.   EVERYTIME someone complains about no wins instead of the mismanagement by Nick the other complaint with basis in factual information get drowned out and I'm tired of it.

Yes...I love seeing him up front....I love seeing some actual shots and not 1 or 2 unnecessary touches, I like the energy he brings up front.  Now we just need to figure out if its our wings or what that needs to get him the ball more.  Try to have some better possession to get to him Idk, there are too many things on this team that it is hard to pinpoint any one area that could be the missing link."
PhillyUnion,35tvsg,spqr-king,3,Wed May 13 14:53:35 2015 UTC,Kinda wish Ayuk would have taken his call up as well the more experience these players get the better it will be in the long term. We just really need to improve the bottom half of our roster to compensate.

PhillyUnion,35tvsg,spqr-king,1 point,Wed May 13 17:37:31 2015 UTC,I think it was the U-20's and he said no on the basis that he wanted to focus on the club and keeping his starting position which I admire. That being said could have been a good opportunity to train while we are in free fall. Not to sure about the quality of the Cameroonian players though so maybe he is better off here? Not sure...

You're probably not making actual VP money, and when you go to get that second job, you're not going to have the diversity in experience to get the same level of title. It's a stingy move on the part of Nick Sak to do that, and short sighted to go along with it. It looks like a lot of the management is in the same sort of position... Including the coaching staff. I think it's the Union's MO."

Respect is a two way street. I sympathize with the players, but they need to sympathize with our perspective as well. Nando got it right when he tweeted that they'd do everything they could to fix the situation. Mondragon got it right when he apologized after losing to Dallas. Le Toux got it right when he stayed to sign autographs after every game, regardless of result. These guys I will always have respect for, no matter what, because they understood that the fans aren't JUST here to support them regardless of the situation.

Candyman has now been on the decline for well over a season. I remember the end of 2013 when he started to regress. It then continued over the entirety of 2014. Why, now, in 2015, are people STILL thinking this is some temporary lapse?"
PhillyUnion,35m9jn,starcom_magnate,4,Mon May 11 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. His game has devolved into the gimmick of his long throw (which is completely useless and stupid) and crying for fouls constantly. Any promise he once had is a distant memory, I'd like to see him shipped out if only to give him a chance to continue having a pro career. Otherwise I can see him heading down the same path Austin Berry did."
PhillyUnion,35m9jn,goatyhead,2,Mon May 11 19:21:55 2015 UTC,Not to defend him but could it be the constant change between RB and unnatural LB?
PhillyUnion,35m9jn,spqr-king,5,Mon May 11 22:34:47 2015 UTC,Williams was almost exclusively played at RB. I can think of only a few one-off instances where he moved to the left. Gaddis was the one played out of position the whole time.
PhillyUnion,35m9jn,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Mon May 11 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"While I agree he's been on the decline, I wouldn't say his long throw is useless. It essentially makes every throw in on their end a corner kick. It's not Williams fault they can't convert it"
PhillyUnion,35m9jn,goatyhead,1 point,Wed May 13 07:50:31 2015 UTC,Perhaps but if it isn't working why keep doing it? At the very least it should only be a sometimes thing. I clearly recall one instance where Maidana went for a quick throw to keep things going only to be called off so we could wait for Williams to walk(that's another pet peeve) over for the long throw-in.

We aren't much better but if they could fight back from mistakes I think we'd all be having a different conversation this week.

PhillyUnion,35ilka,spqr-king,13,Sun May 10 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"I think Curtin has to stay. I love what (it seems like) he is doing behind closed doors. He's finally stepping up to those that shouldn't be making decisions. M'Bohli is out. Gaddis, the better back, is getting to play in his desired position. Pfeffer is playing. Ayuk is starting. I praise Curtin for that.   Sounds like they'll address a LB, GK (ugh), and some other gaps soon.   I think we need to cut the fat. Wenger needs to get out of his own head. Let him play with the islanders or something, because we know he's good, just not right now. Fabinho, Fred, and Carroll could all go. I'd love to see Catic and McLaughlin have a chance on the field. All of the fresh blood hasn't disappointed so far.   Sak out (duh). Get a health & fitness program together so we can stay healthy. If we had all out players I think we'd have a strong starting 11. We just have too many injuries."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,markd248,4,Sun May 10 21:10:02 2015 UTC,That last note you made is huge as well to many of our players are coming down early in the season and often.  Downvotes for injuries?
PhillyUnion,35ilka,rabidfrodo,12,Sun May 10 22:32:25 2015 UTC,I'd rather just see the team let Curtin grow into his role. The team doesn't have the ability to turn this team around. We can't sell our players and can't bring in enough new ones. Letting Curtin grow into his role this season might not be pretty but could do wonders in years to come.   Agree with you on players who seem out of their depth. Overall the team has players to build around. You can see that at moments during the games. They currently all seem to be in a different page searching a moment on their own.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,midwesternhousewives,4,Sun May 10 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"Sak isn't going to leave as he has part ownership.  These owners don't care about having a winning team, what they want is $$$.  As long as seats are full and they turn a profit, they're going to stay the course."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,rabidfrodo,2,Sun May 10 21:26:28 2015 UTC,Ya I get that. Still though we can create a good team with cheap owners. It is having people who know what to do run this team.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,rabidfrodo,1 point,Sun May 10 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"Which he clearly does not. I believe in the ""money ball"" system but they play it in the worst way possible. I dont know how many seasons its going to take to get that point across."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,DrewGo,1 point,Mon May 11 01:21:52 2015 UTC,Agreed you can't have a coach abd technical director both learn on the job and not expect issues. This is much worse and some of the blame goes to the players. As much as certain people on this subreddit refuse to admit.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,midwesternhousewives,2,Mon May 11 02:43:08 2015 UTC,Sak could be forced out of his role by the other owners and if he doesnt get the team on track that is entirely possible. He is a minority owner which is not mutually exclusive from his role as GM.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,DrewGo,1 point,Sun May 10 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"Listen, I think Sak sucks as much as the next guy, but I find this line of thinking ridiculous. All business owners care about profit. I doubt that there are many sports franchise owners in the world that are like, ""You know what? I don't give a shit if this business turns a profit, this is just fun for me."" Moreover, you're crazy if you don't think having a winning team is the best way to make the team profitable. More people would show up to the games if they're rooting for a team that plays good, winning soccer. More asses in the seats means more money. Nick Sak might not have any idea how to create a winning team, but to suggest that he doesn't want the team to win is just nonsense."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,jpoRS,1 point,Mon May 11 12:47:51 2015 UTC,"There's a difference though. Most owners find a medium.  What I'm saying is the stadium is near sell-out capacity almost every game anyway, so it becomes a cost/rewards issue for ownership.  Pay more money for a winning team to help fill in a few of the remaining seats, or don't pay much and have it near capacity every game.  From a business perspective, it makes sense to NOT spend the money.  What I'm saying is that winning isn't the priority for the team.  They're plan going forward as they stated is to bring in cheap youth players, have them grow into solid players, and then sell them for high profit.  Not that there's anything wrong with youth players, I think that's great. But the team will have a high turnover rate going forward.    Yes, every team wants to make a profit obviously.  But other teams make winning a priority as well.  I honestly don't believe that Sak does.  Sure he wants to win, but probably not at any expense and more of a ""it would be a nice bonus"".  Look at his history with other clubs."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Mon May 11 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably a risk/rewards thing for just about every owner in the league. Sure, some have a lot more money to play with, but money does not equal a better team. Just look at Toronto. Teams like Columbus have created winning teams without spending crazy amounts of money. It can be done on the cheap, we just don't have the personelle to do it.   And again, near sell-out capacity is not the same as selling out every game. And if the demand for tickets is higher they can raise prices and make more money. If the team is winning they might attract more out-of-market fans and make more money on merchandising. They might attract more/better sponsors and more money. There are a LOT of ways being a winning team helps the organization makes money. I don't doubt for a second that Nick wants the team to win, I just think he has no idea how to make it happen in a budget."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,jpoRS,5,Mon May 11 17:33:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe you can answer this for me. Let's pretend that Curtin does go, and Petke comes to town. What is different?"
PhillyUnion,35ilka,jpoRS,2,Sun May 10 21:57:24 2015 UTC,A coach with experience
PhillyUnion,35ilka,jpoRS,3,Sun May 10 21:59:24 2015 UTC,Not sure why you got down voted this is the truth Petke led the red bulls to the Supporters Shield and did well for that team. He wouldn't be my first choice but he has experience with a different and successful team even if it's Energy Drink FC. Our formation and tactics will change as well as our players because he will likely make big changes coming from outside of the organization which is one of the reasons Curtin kept almost the entire team from his predecessor. Curtin can be a good coach and just a new coach won't change much but it could help.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,jpoRS,2,Sun May 10 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"If Petke isn't your first choice, who is? What makes them better than Curtin?"
PhillyUnion,35ilka,jpoRS,1 point,Sun May 10 22:59:37 2015 UTC,Well way to put me on the spot... Im not GM but Meulensteen would bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to the role. He also seems to have a serious interest in the Union and where they are going. Outside of him realistically we would have to look around. Chris Ramsey could be on his way out at QPR so that could be an option he had success at Charleston. I think they should at least do one actual world wide search rather than searching the cafeteria at PPL Park.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Sun May 10 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"That's my point though, no one crying for Curtin's head has an answer to this problem. Meulensteen has bounced around through enough teams, so I guess it's easy to say he's got experience. If Keystone Sports won't splash out on a decent squad, you think they'll spend the money to bring in a Premier League manager like Ramsey? And even if they did, do we really want one whose entire resume is a few months at a big team, and a third tier team a decade ago?  This is my point- the grass isn't always greener. We've tried the new manager thing, twice. And we're still the same shitty team we were when Nowak left. Blaming the coach is ignoring the much larger problems with this organization.  Edit: Fixed a pronoun."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,jpoRS,0,Mon May 11 00:21:42 2015 UTC,Im not crying for his head im saying I dont think he is ready there is a huge difference. I love his attitude and he seems like a great guy but look at what a coaching change did for the NYRB. Sure they had a great team before but now they are playing better overall without really shuffling around that many bodies. Also Rene was an assistant for quite some time with top tier EPL teams. Im not saying he is the answer but it couldnt hurt to have someone with global expertise. The biggest problem Curtin has is he came in with the players he has at his disposal now a share of whom are not MLS caliber players. He has made some good decisions in letting Ayuk start and dealing with the GK fiasco but there is no reason Fabinho should be have been on our roster this season. Again that is not our only problem by a long shot but it could be improved.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Mon May 11 01:16:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Curtin is the best in the league, but thinking management is the solution to our problems is like adjusting the thermostat when your house is on fire.  And Red Bulls were good and continue to be good. You could just as easily count their ""improvement"" (if there is any) to improved team chemistry (since the players came in knowing one another and Tim Cahill's sourpuss is out of the locker room) as you could to coaching."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,m4nu,2,Mon May 11 04:09:52 2015 UTC,Thats why there is a list of four other points up there. It is not all chemistry Marsh changed how the team plays making them even more dangerous. Im not saying thats all we need to do and poof we are better thats why its only one of the points up there but this is Curtins first season fully at the helm of any team. There comes a point where experience really does matter in any job around the world especially one as technical as managing a team and you cant ignore that fact at this point. 4 other points up there guys stop trying to act like this is the only one.
PhillyUnion,35ilka,EdBacon,1 point,Mon May 11 10:49:04 2015 UTC,"Your other points aren't getting much attention because there's not much meat there.   2- Not only is it obvious players need to be reshuffled, there's no real way to do it. Even if Keystone Sports were out to spend money, there isn't much they can do until the summer transfer window opens up. 3- Solid life advice but really as far as professional athletes go MLS players are pretty mild. This isn't a team problem so much as a problem of one specific guy. 4- Have they stopped developing players? To my knowledge the Union Academy is still in place, and if that's the case what are you trying to say here? 5- Would you really feel better if Sak, Sugarman, or Curtin said ""yeah we goofed but we're going to do things differently now""? They've said it before and nothing changed, so why would this time be any different?   You're getting torn apart because you used a lot of words to not say anything."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,Mike81890,-1,Mon May 11 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"We're not running for president here, meaningless platitudes do nothing. What does Petke do differently that makes this team something other than the laughing stock it is currently?"
PhillyUnion,35ilka,akuller,1 point,Sun May 10 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"Well aside from the supporters' shield he had another good season with ny and took them to the playoffs and conference final. Granted he had Thierry Henry and BWP but I have no doubt he would do a better job tactically than Curtin. No one in this organization has won anything. There is no winning attitude here. That's part of what someone like Petke brings to this team.   Granted he wouldn't come in in and take us to a supporters' shield without big roster changes but he's someone long term, not someone to fix this season. And it's not like the organization would hire him anyway so.  And having experience isn't just a platitude here. Curtin is entirely out of his element tactically."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,Mike81890,1 point,Sun May 10 23:37:17 2015 UTC,"But he wouldn't be coaching the Red Bulls, he would be coaching the Union. I don't want to know what he's done. I want to know what he would do differently. It's easy to say who he would bench, but who would he play in their place? How would training be different? What tactics could be applied to eliminate the massive liabilities we have starting no matter which eleven you pick? How will coaching address these problems?"
PhillyUnion,35ilka,rabidfrodo,2,Mon May 11 00:12:51 2015 UTC,"But he wouldn't be coaching the Red Bulls, he would be coaching the Union.   no shit?!  you're demanding to know too much from a hypothetical. without him at the helm of this team we don't know what he'd do and we have to base it on what he's done in the past, same reason why any coaches get hired at a top level.  You asked what he brings to the table, and I gave it to you; he has more experience than Curtin by far. Anything else is hard to tell or judge by without actually having him be the coach or even talking to him."
PhillyUnion,35ilka,DrewGo,0,Mon May 11 02:12:07 2015 UTC,"Curtin isn't the issue BUT as devils advocate:  Immediately: the psychological impact of a guy with a winning resume. A guy who has won the SS, and who no one doubts can win the SS - from players to ownership to fans.   That puts an immediate dent in the losing culture growing at the Union. When Curtin was hired what were the immediate reactions?  ""Not ready to be a head coach.""  ""No experience""  Petke, psychologically, does not have the same faults.  And I do believe a significant part of our team's problem atm is psychological. Unless you truly believe Union is 20/20 in player ability/skill - which I don't."

M'Bolhi is out of favor with the coach so the team is going to try to sell him during the next major transfer window opportunity.  He's back to train, on his own, not with the team.  M'Bolhi is closer to the next chapter as are the Union.

Our defensive back 4 get circles run around them with Williams having a great throw in but that seems about it, Gaddis is good but has momentary lapses, and we had Wheeler....WHEELER as Centerback last season, and instead of going for anything to help with that....this offseason we got a striker with Aristigueta who honestly I feel kinda bad for and THREE goalkeepers.....and guess what....NONE OF THE GOALKEEPERS ARE PLAYING. Was Zac McMath great? NO he had a couple timing issues and some hesitancy coming off his line. Did the 4 in front of him help at any time? Nope. I will gladly defend the River's End but I will be fucked LONG before I am asked to defend the decisions and direction the Front office has taken this team and what we can look forward too. Dammit Union.....For 5 years ive gladly stood in the Rivers End....but I have nothing to look forward too either academy or otherwise.  Fuck.....Im more excited for the Philadelphia Soul being 7-0 in Arena football......ARENA FOOTBALL this year......at least they have won championships ._."

Fans have the right to criticize the team. But the line between fair criticism and just trashing the team is there, and some have crossed it. Antoine is a part of the Union, like it or not, and I'm sure other players, both starters and bench warmers, have similar opinions as him. Yes, the way Antoine responded to some people was allittle brash. But atleast he is showing heart for the team, something which I as a Philly fan respect. The players (most of them) want to win, whether they play 90 mins every week or get a bench appearance here and there.  Criticize the coaching. Call for Nick Sakiewics' head. But don't bag on the players who atleast give a shit about the team, no matter their involvement."
PhillyUnion,35g94k,DarkwingMcQuack,-6,Sun May 10 18:30:28 2015 UTC,Thank you Hoppenot for speaking the truth.

PhillyUnion,35g94k,avsman,-8,Sun May 10 07:43:03 2015 UTC,well...he actually has a point
PhillyUnion,35g94k,B4kstabr,19,Sun May 10 01:43:45 2015 UTC,"He actually doesn't.  We have been witnessing the slow decline of this for the past 3 years.  We have been there for 2 straight "" fire coach hire assistant coach after exhaustive searches"" that have pulled up nothing.  We watched whatever the he'll this revolving door of goalies has lead us too.  We have been given nothing to support,  and if anything people support the players we just fucking hate the front office that has blatantly shown no regard for the fan base."
PhillyUnion,35g94k,DarkwingMcQuack,-14,Sun May 10 01:47:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes he does. Philly sports fans always give up the teams when they lose. They just bitch and leave like the fairweather fans they are. Yes we need a new FO, but if you can't deal with the rough times then maybe you should stop supporting the team and never come back."
PhillyUnion,35g94k,spqr-king,12,Sun May 10 03:03:35 2015 UTC,Why dont people understand that being frustrated with a team doenst mean you dont support them? Venting is normal im not going out buying NYCFC gear and reading the song sheet. I had a Union flag hanging in my yard until today where it ironically flew away while I was gone. There is a difference between supporting the players and coaching staff and blindly following an ownership group who obviously does not believe in the team.
PhillyUnion,35g94k,EdBacon,4,Sun May 10 03:17:45 2015 UTC,The players deserve better than what this FO is doing to them.
PhillyUnion,35g94k,spqr-king,5,Sun May 10 03:20:53 2015 UTC,Exactly. If I was the owner I would be leading from the Capo stands at the rivers end shaking hands after every match. Why am I supposed to blindly throw my support behind an ownership group that clearly doesn't care about the team more than I do? I love this team and all it represents but its a situation of conflict in which the players should always know we support them.
PhillyUnion,35g94k,FlapjackJackson,7,Sun May 10 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"Really, you are going to pull the ""you're not a true fan"" card? It's the lazy argument for someone who has no other ground to fall back on.  We're not leaving. However, sitting here quietly and ignoring the sinking ship while handing this team money week after week is not going to change anything. This team has been a joke since the second half of 2011. Excuse us if we are fed up with years of losing and boneheaded expectations. We want this team to be something we can be proud of, not embarrassed by."
PhillyUnion,35g94k,DarkwingMcQuack,-7,Sun May 10 03:38:35 2015 UTC,Well I hope you enjoy your complaining. All you're going to do is get yourself more pissed off.
PhillyUnion,35g94k,FlapjackJackson,6,Sun May 10 03:55:20 2015 UTC,Complaining got Hack fired. Complaining is likely the only thing which will bring much needed change like a GM. The ownership doesn't want to piss off fans and lose ticket sales.
PhillyUnion,35g94k,EdBacon,4,Sun May 10 04:26:07 2015 UTC,"Why does this team deserve my support? Because it happens to be located in Philadelphia? That's a nice racket they got then. I have a lot of other things to do with my time and money than drive to Chester to get pissed off, but for whatever reason, here I am. At least we should demand better, maybe one day we'll have a real team."
PhillyUnion,35g94k,DarkwingMcQuack,-5,Sun May 10 03:14:07 2015 UTC,No ones forcing you to support them. If you want to jump ship go right ahead. I plan on sticking around to the very end.

PhillyUnion,35g94k,rabidfrodo,3,Sun May 10 14:59:14 2015 UTC,I do that and complain while driving from D.C. each game. I pay to show up I gain the right to voice my opinion on the poor product.

It has nothing to do with a person's football-watching resume. Also, they aren't being ""emotional"" - they just have a differing opinion than you.   Ex-pat here that has played and watched for well over two decades - I attended matches before the formation of the Premier League in England. There are more than 0.01% of us.   This club has a virus. At the top, the ownership is content with putting out just enough of a team to sell tickets to a community that is starving for football. Nothing more. Which trickles down to the coaches that have to work with sub-par facilities and resources. In addition, the players sense the lack of urgency from above and it has to play a part in their (lack of) motivation and focus. Which makes the supporters feel that the whole club is a complete mess. Can we be blamed?  No, I will not blindly accept less than the same level of passion the support has from my local club."

It's a huge hassle to get up early and watch them anyway (I'm on China time) - as well as finding a stream that works because MLS Live doesn't seem to want to make money off an Asian audience and its a toss up if its not being nationally aired whether I will at all.  Just to be miserable?  So fuck it.  That's how it starts, Keystone Sports. I own two jersies. I have gone to dozens of games when I lived in the area. And now I can't be assed to put in the slightest bit of effort to watch this dumpster fire, and I'm sure I'm not the only one."

I came here straight after graduation searching for adventure (and work). Found both. Looking to leave HK next year though. The expensive rent can be a bit annoying after a while honestly. Hopefully I can get transferred to London so I can get some European experience. In the meantime, it's 7 am Union matches in a city where no one knows MLS exists outside of the rare American expat who supports LA or the Sounders."

PhillyUnion,35g4hq,MortalSmurph,-1,Sun May 10 01:13:31 2015 UTC,I dont know about that the keeper is the commander of the back line and we give up goals like candy.

PhillyUnion,35g4hq,EdBacon,2,Sun May 10 01:25:50 2015 UTC,Seeing it difficult to see how it is Curtin's fault. We have 3-4 good depth players off the bench and 5-6 injured possible starters. That means he has very few and obviously predictable options. That's not his fault. Who would you play to radically alter the game? We went to our reserve squad for this game! That's some FO buffoonery. People that would fail in manager mode on FIFA are running the team.
PhillyUnion,35g4hq,cee_smooth,2,Sun May 10 01:40:47 2015 UTC,"It's not entirely Curtin's fault, and I honestly feel bad for him right now considering he was thrown to the wolves to be a cheap scapegoat for the owners with little support. He might make a good coach some day with proper guidance and grooming.   Ben Olsen was given the job in DC in 2010 while younger than Curtin and he's managed a couple good seasons so it's possible Curtin does the same thing with a full year under his belt. That's what I'm hoping for."

PhillyUnion,35g4hq,everydayasOrenG,2,Sun May 10 01:10:56 2015 UTC,Onside.  When the ball was kicked the attacking player was entirely behind Williams.  Here's an unedited pic.  Look at the horizontal lines on the turf.  If it isn't clear I made it bolder HERE.  Here's a pic so you can see the turf lines are perpendicular to the sidelines.
PhillyUnion,35gu0z,IPv6_and_BASS,3,Sun May 10 05:31:56 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest here a bulk of our players are not what we need in order to win games that much is clear. Antoine is complaining about something he will likely never be apart of because with players of his caliber we cannot and will not be competitive in MLS. Plain and simple not going to sugar coat it. We are not a young club NYCFC and Orlando are young clubs we are coming on our 8th season and have gotten worse year over year. Our top three goal scorers last season have combined for zero total goals this season and that is inexcusable as a player because these guys are professional athletes who are getting paid to do this and as such are expected in top form and nothing less. This whole mentality doesnt make sense in anyway what so ever. If you are a good player/young player playing your heart out on a shit team I will support you that means Ayuk, Pfeffer, Nando and a few other players who are giving their all to try and make something out of this but if your just dragging the team down and throwing a pity party because your not good enough or not willing to put in the work why should I support you? Who here is blindly supporting Fabinho when he is called onto the field? I rest my case.  Edit* Also Curtin I just feel bad for the guy he got thrown to the wolves in a situation where he really couldnt win. Bring in a well respected winning coach and give Curtin his old job back or make him an academy coach. His experience we have given him at the helm shouldnt be wasted by just sacking him."
PhillyUnion,35gu0z,spqr-king,1 point,Sun May 10 13:48:01 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your well thought out and reasoned comment, but I pretty much disagree 100%.  Yeah we all can understand that the players are frustrated and that it sucks for them too to be on such a bad run.  But these guys have it easier than any other professional athlete in the country.   No other sport is there this silly attitude that the fans should always be supportive.  And MLS is the least popular league by orders of magnitude.  So not only are there fewer fans, but also few critics per fan and they can't even handle that.  It's childish, and it is an amateur attitude.    I've done the team a disservice to criticize them on social media.   That's not a disservice. It is the very least what fans should be doing, we should criticize the players.  We should single out players who have done poorly.  We should criticize the coach for poor decisions and we definitely should criticize the FO and their mismanagement. That is the very least we should be doing.   But as we all know, money speaks loudest.  And I don't want to blame the fans and the SOB outright because it is kinda like victim blaming, but in they are also enabling the them.  The Union and the FO lack an incentive to really improve since they know they have die-hard fans who will always support them, aka always give over their money.  Criticism is part of sports, and MLS and their players see a minuscule amount of it comparatively. This supporters mentality has got to go."
PhillyUnion,35gu0z,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Mon May 11 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"Antoine is saying the truth, and I'm sure many of the 1st teamers are frustrated quietly. Criticism is different than insulting. I will support this team until the end of time, because I love the Union. But I want to see more fruition from the team we have. The quality of this team is arguably the best we've had in a while (arguably). One win in 11 games is an utter disgrace. The GK carousel is a joke that deserves a certain Nick Sak to be fired. There needs to be overhaul to this young club, but in a professional matter.  We are Philly sports fans. Times are rough, and we live with that. But we want to see at least some hope. The sixers have a plan. The Eagles supposedly have an idea of what they're doing. The Flyers show some flashes of brilliance. Disregard the Phillies, they are in the same boat as the Union. Old vets who aren't the same as a couple years ago, a terrible GM, wasted youth products...  They're is about 2/3s of the season left. The rest of the East isn't exactly running away. I don't expect a cup, but I'd gladly ruin another team's playoff hopes.  EDIT: Grammar things"
PhillyUnion,35gu0z,Timothy-H,5,Sun May 10 06:47:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this, but really we have about 5 or 6 players who should be starting in MLS. The rest of the team just isn't there. It's not their fault they're being thrust into this situation by a cheap and incompetent FO, but I honestly don't see this turning around without major roster upheaval.   The more this has gone on the more I feel it won't change until the team is sold. It starts with Sugarman and the owners. If they're treating the Union like a piece of property they want to flip, then the product on the field is going to reflect that lack of investment. Until we get somebody whose primary goal is to build a soccer team, not move an investment property, I think we'll continue to have problems."

PhillyUnion,35g19w,spqr-king,2,Sun May 10 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"I think the Phillies will be even worse this year than the Union.  But I'm honestly still fairly positive about the Union.  We said at the beginning of the year that our starting 11 is good enough to win games, but it is just that our depth that is lacking.    So we new we would have to be lucky in the injury department and we haven't been.  We've had key guys missing every single game of the season, the beginning of the year the refs hurt us, and things just continued to fly out of control with the keeper situation.  I still think we can be a good/respectable team this year if we can get everyone healthy,  Nogueira is almost ready to start again,  get Sapong back, figure out keeper situation.  Then we absolutely need to sell M'Bolhi and sign a LB and a CDM.    If all that can happen, which is a big if but I think it will, then we can sort of regroup and turn things around a bit."

PhillyUnion,35cfuy,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sat May 9 00:22:39 2015 UTC,"Huh, Kinkead has cited sources saying he's more like $350K. I hope it's not as high as this article suggests. Ouch."
PhillyUnion,35cfuy,thelostdolphin,3,Sat May 9 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Do you know what the DP threshold is this year with the new CBA?  Maybe both are correct.  $450-500k is M'Bolhi's actual salary, but $350k is his cap hit after buying it down with allocation money."
PhillyUnion,35cfuy,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Sat May 9 18:26:26 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. I'm not sur  about the threshold is now though. I'll try to look.
PhillyUnion,35cfuy,thelostdolphin,2,Sat May 9 18:31:24 2015 UTC,"According to this comment the threshold is $436,250. Although it's even, that's such an odd number."
PhillyUnion,35cfuy,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Sat May 9 19:23:07 2015 UTC,Oh nice. Thanks. I was just looking.
PhillyUnion,35cfuy,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Sat May 9 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much room against the cap the Union currently have. Seeing as Maidana is no longer a DP and Fernando is a Young DP, our DP slots take up 436k and 250k of the cap respectively. Which means M'bolhi might have stuff in his contract that is kept off the books so he doesn't count as a DP. Maidana had a salary of around 200k last year, so the additional cap hit that made him a DP must've been the transfer fee, so his cap hit goes from 400k to 200k-ish so there's roughly 200k in savings there. Plus 450-500k for M'bolhi being off the books.  So realistically we could have 700k in cap space to work with once M'Bolhi is gone which would make sense if the team is looking for a DP level striker and a LB which means you could use 436k of that 700k for a striker and the remaining on a LB. 200k could get a decent LB, especially considering our options right now.  These numbers are all speculative and based on player salaries of last year (namely for Maidana). I wonder when we're gonna get the players union numbers..."
PhillyUnion,35cfuy,jpoRS,3,Sat May 9 00:54:57 2015 UTC,"That 436k needs to go toward midfield depth so much more than we need another striker. Real wingers and another CDM, or even just drop it all on an attacking mid who can play out wide, like Lee Nguyen."
PhillyUnion,35cfuy,bmangan,1 point,Sat May 9 02:08:42 2015 UTC,Of course. I'm just trying to put it into perspective of what the Union could do given what the current rumors are.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place."

When FIFA announced the formation of MLS as a condition in granting the US the '94 World Cup, I was thrilled.  I was as DCU fan until the day I heard that Philly -- where I was born, and raised just outside of -- was getting a team, and ALREADY HAD A SUPPORTERS GROUP IN PLACE, I nearly lost it.  Finally, my own football club!!!!      I should have known from step 1, placing the fucking stadium in Chester, this would be bad.  Fuck you Ed Rendell!  Seriously, it has less to do with it being Chester, and more to do with it being down I-95.  It's Philly!  All of our stadiums (stadia?) are IN THE SAME PLACE!  I've been to lots of Phillies, Eagles, Flyers, and even some Sixers games over the years.  Getting off at Broad and Pattison and feeling the vibe of everyone getting amped up, is like no other.  There was some of that in the lots in Chester when I went to a game a couple years ago -- Le Toux's return when he was playing for the Whitecaps -- but, not the same.    That first year, being DCU at the Linc, was amazing.  I thought to myself ""this would be great to make this an annual thing!""      I heard rumors of PPL Park being expandable to 30k fans.  I heard talk of reinvigorating Chester.  Whatever, would be great, but we'd have to wait and see.  We make the playoffs in our second season!  Yay, team is going places!  Only up from here, with the passion and support of Philly fans!      And then since then.....    ...just complete and utter frustration and confusion.  The Novak years?  Jesus Christ, how did this guy get so much power, and then just rip the team apart?  Anyway, we got rid of him.  Think that the worst is over.    Nope.    Game after game of no offense, blowing late leads, unable to score a man up, no exciting roster moves, no exciting anything.  Just a shell of a football club, which should be ashamed to claim any part of the grit and passion of Philly sports.    The lone bright spot was beating Dallas in the Open Cup semis.  I celebrated that one hard.  Other than that, what do we have to celebrate?  When are the golden years coming?  Will there be a day when a game at the Linc once a year is looked forward to, and the seats packed, to cheer on the U?  Will we win a cup?  Will there be a day when Ronaldo or the next European star who wants to play his sunset years in the US puts the U on his short list of teams?  Will I care to spend money on this team, ever?      For now, we weep....    tl;dr:  sadness...    Have a great weekend, mates!"
PhillyUnion,35b9lz,MorphineSmile,4,Fri May 8 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"Not having the stadium in Philly where all the other stadiums are does kind of suck. I feel like it separates the team from the City and it's sports fans, but I don't see that ever changing and honestly if the idea was to make Chester a better place for the community then I'm all for it, if it actually works.   The Union are...abysmal right now, yes. So much so that it's kind of embarrassing when you chat with other people on /r/MLS who are fans of big teams like Seattle or LA or even teams that are playing money-ball (like we're supposedly doing) and are doing just fine like SKC. That's Philly sports though, really. We suck for a while, maybe win something (2008 Phillies amirite) then suck again (2012 Phillies amirite).   Right now we're young, the team is only 5 years old. Is that an excuse for our terrible performance? No, but I think it needs to be said because we have such a big future ahead of us (hopefully). Who knows, maybe next year Sak sells the team to someone who gives a damn and our fortunes change and we start being a real contender.  You never know with this sport and this city.   It's hard, but we have to keep our heads up in situations like this. I'm just as depressed and negative as the next guy, but I think it's important to not let it get to us too much. Our golden days are ahead of us, we just have to wait."

PhillyUnion,35b9lz,OshiHidra,2,Fri May 8 20:23:07 2015 UTC,I just woke up. I had a dream we lost 5-3 to Vancouver. That feels unrealistic - scoring 3 goals?
PhillyUnion,35b9lz,m4nu,1 point,Sat May 9 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"What do you all drink? Not just during games (although recently that's been my peak drinking time), but just in general.   I've been getting super into Hard Cider lately and bought a 6 pack of Woodchuck the other day, but haven't had any yet. Strongbow and Angry Orchard are both pretty dope."
PhillyUnion,35b9lz,Too_many_hippos,4,Fri May 8 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"I love Hard Cider, but I find that if I get drunk off of them the hangover is awful. I think it's all the sugar. If I'm planning on getting drunk it's usually Beer or Tequila. Tequila is responsible for all of my best/worst nights/days ever."
PhillyUnion,35b9lz,DrewGo,2,Fri May 8 19:58:38 2015 UTC,It's definitely the sugar. Especially the shit 'ciders' getting popular right now like that Angry Orchard stuff. It's not even cider. Just malt beverage with sugary apple flavor.
PhillyUnion,35b9lz,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri May 8 21:22:57 2015 UTC,Mostly beer. PBR if I wanna go cheap or something like Sam Adams especially the seasonal stuff (Octoberfest is god tier). Also been drinking a lot of this: http://i.imgur.com/UBE6UVS.jpg which is really good.  It's summer season so I'll be drinking a lot of shandy's and other summery beers. Landshark is a good cheap option for this.
PhillyUnion,35b9lz,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Fri May 8 19:02:36 2015 UTC,When I was in England I drank lots and lots of Strongbow. Having it in a pub on draft ice cold is fucking amazing and definitely beats the imported stuff here in the US. They also have this flavor variant called dark fruits which is by far the best tasting cider I've ever had.   If you ever make it to the UK go to any Tesco's and just walk up and down the cider isle. They have tons and tons of single bottles of all these weird flavors. While I was there I spent so much money on cider. But for now in the US I've only ever had Woodchuck (just a few months until I'm 21 and can go on a cider tasting spree!) which I really enjoy too.
PhillyUnion,35b9lz,bear_antlers,0,Sat May 9 16:14:31 2015 UTC,Started drinking wine more often there are a great deal of variates so its cool to learn the history of it and where it came from but the same can be said for beer.

PhillyUnion,35b9lz,spqr-king,2,Fri May 8 19:13:07 2015 UTC,I don't even think I can predict anything. This season has been absurdly crazy already.

PhillyUnion,35b5jy,WJMorris3,3,Fri May 8 17:12:51 2015 UTC,Pretty much done?  I think the fact they went with a short term loan of a BACKUP KEEPER from an NASL team mean that he's definitely done.
PhillyUnion,35b5jy,midwesternhousewives,2,Fri May 8 19:14:45 2015 UTC,I feel like we got scammed and now we need to find someone to scam... So I guess Rais M'Bolhi is the MLS equivalent to a pyramid scheme.
PhillyUnion,35b5jy,rnc487,3,Fri May 8 19:14:56 2015 UTC,pyramids have points. there was no point to the Rais experiment. that's all i got
PhillyUnion,35b5jy,everydayasOrenG,2,Fri May 8 22:28:50 2015 UTC,I know every Union fan hates him and I get that. But I feel bad for the guy. The whole fanbase can't stand him and now the coach basically said he doesn't want him here either.   That's gotta feel awful and he isn't gonna train with the team. So now he is here in this city that hates him far away from home training by himself.   And I understand he is a pro athlete and this comes with the territory but he is still just a guy as well.
PhillyUnion,35b5jy,drain222000,3,Fri May 8 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"I'd feel bad if it were purely performance based, but it sounds like it's largely bad interactions with the players and coaches in the locker room and practice field. That stuff is in your control and he clearly isn't interested in being a positive teammate."
PhillyUnion,358w3s,Mountainhawk98,1 point,Fri May 8 02:08:59 2015 UTC,It kind of irks me that this article makes it seem like all three have failed when in actuality it's just that two are injured.
PhillyUnion,358w3s,zlintner1,4,Fri May 8 05:13:53 2015 UTC,M'Bolhi is an abject failure. So it's still an accurate statement.
PhillyUnion,358w3s,KFCConspiracy,6,Fri May 8 13:10:03 2015 UTC,I'd also say Third String Local has been a bit of a disaster as well. All the puff pieces in the world won't make him MLS quality.
PhillyUnion,358w3s,HandsomePete215,2,Fri May 8 13:30:09 2015 UTC,"No doubt. But somehow, he's better than a keeper who played in the world cup."

PhillyUnion,356jjx,Dean_Moriarty,8,Thu May 7 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"Even though he would be a big loss to not be available for the Union, it would be better long term if he makes the squad. I'm rooting for him!"
PhillyUnion,356jjx,Too_many_hippos,3,Thu May 7 15:01:16 2015 UTC,Hope he gets it! Pfeffer is a great player and deserves more.   Did he come up through our academy? That would be a good sign of what it can provide if he did.
PhillyUnion,356jjx,FatboyAFC,1 point,Thu May 7 15:37:12 2015 UTC,I'd say he was a Union academy product. He signed at 15 and has presumably played/trained with the Union aside from his loan spell in Germany.
PhillyUnion,356jjx,akuller,0,Fri May 8 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I would say he was an academy player because I think the academy started last year.  But I'm pretty sure we signed him in 2011 when he was like 16 years old. First homegrown player, local kid, so I think it would be fair to say the Union developed him as a player."
PhillyUnion,356jjx,akuller,4,Thu May 7 15:42:51 2015 UTC,The Union basically took over the FC Delco Men's academy from what I understand.  Zack was part of the Delco Academy prior to signing his HGP contract.
PhillyUnion,356jjx,Too_many_hippos,2,Thu May 7 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"I think FC Delco still exists.  The way I understand it is that the Union became affiliated with a bunch of local youth teams like FC Delco. We would give them some kind of resources, I dunno what, a bag of balls maybe.  And in return the Union had the MLS rights to all of the players, thus making it possible to sign them as homegrowns.   But I don't think that system is the same as having their own academy like they recently built where they control everything."
PhillyUnion,356jjx,TweetPoster,2,Thu May 7 16:04:39 2015 UTC,I know it is there for the girls but Delco was the equivalent of the DC United academy a few years ago.  There were some regional boundaries put in place for some of the top level youth clubs for boys.  It affected a few people I knew who were in between and wanted to switch clubs...  I think the union took over there u12-u18 program as they felt it would hurt both if they were competing for the top talent.
PhillyUnion,356jjx,goatyhead,2,Thu May 7 17:01:49 2015 UTC,Ah OK. I knew that we had him for awhile now. Still pretty good for our development reputation I guess.

PhillyUnion,356jjx,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu May 7 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"Assuming Zelalem is on the squad, would he be officially tied to the US?  I hope Pfeffer doesn't go because the Union need him anyway but especially if it also means locking Zelalem down."
PhillyUnion,356jjx,JerseysFinest,2,Thu May 7 20:17:31 2015 UTC,He'll be cap tied to the U-20's but I think he needs to be on the regular squad to make it permanent. So you'll most likely see him added to the team during the Gold Cup this summer.
PhillyUnion,356jjx,FlapjackJackson,0,Thu May 7 21:05:09 2015 UTC,Club over country guy here. I'd rather have him available for this team since we suck rather than have him go off to a fairly meaningless tournament.
PhillyUnion,356jjx,JerseysFinest,6,Thu May 7 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see him working in the USMNT system, it's not like our season is going anywhere. To each their own though."
PhillyUnion,356jjx,OshiHidra,1 point,Thu May 7 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"The USMNT doesn't help Philly. Regular professional minutes are more critical to his development than youth international minutes. Like i said, I prioritize the Union far above the U.S."
PhillyUnion,356jjx,estebandelasexface12,3,Thu May 7 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"And that's why I said to each their own. I'd rather see him in the USNNT camp getting a different perspective on soccer than just the one in Philly. Getting minutes in matches that matter is a good thing for development, and the pride of playing for your country, at any level, brings out the best each player has to offer."

PhillyUnion,352tv5,goatyhead,4,Wed May 6 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"They said the concussion was from a ball hitting him in the head in practice, but they also described a play in the game that had some kind of head contact that he was already having concussion issues. I swore it had to be this play. It just made no sense. Also with him wearing the helmet he's obviously had concussion problems before and that always makes it easier to get another."

I think all the talent is there for a efficient attack, they just haven't found the tactics or execution to do it.  How whether they will or not is certainly an open question."
PhillyUnion,351ss5,akuller,2,Wed May 6 12:02:37 2015 UTC,The problem is a coaching issue. Our staff focuses on the counter and defense but we cant put put the ball into the net when a team sits back and give us room to operate. It is a fairly accurate assessment that our main strategy is to get it wide and cross and the crosses don't come and when they do are mediocre at best. We don't work the ball in the final third using windows and triangles like we do out wide or in the middle third of the field.
PhillyUnion,351ss5,EdBacon,1 point,Wed May 6 13:31:06 2015 UTC,"They can't counter either, to be fair. It's not a problem of strategy,  but of a total lack of movement and failure to transition effectively. This team is slow and has one of the worst passing games in the league."

If he shows up with his head on straight and ready to work we will be in much better shape, especially heading into the Gold Cup.

PhillyUnion,34yj2p,spqr-king,8,Tue May 5 17:37:17 2015 UTC,Its also the wrong viewpoint... Its not just about his skill its how he meshes with the team and Mbolhi works with our team like a hand works with a garbage disposal. He is toxic and in my mind no better than Blake.
PhillyUnion,34yj2p,Pretzy86,5,Tue May 5 17:41:35 2015 UTC,We haven't seen Blake play that much.  Why not give him another shot
PhillyUnion,34yj2p,spqr-king,3,Tue May 5 17:47:59 2015 UTC,Because Blake is now healthy and deserves the shot before someone who ditched the team mid season to go have a pity party because he played like shit. He showed no remorse or passion and doesnt deserve the benefit of a doubt. I dont know why anyone would defend him he has barely been with the team much less been a positive impact on or off the field.

He did well in WC we all get that but his whole career he has bounced around not because he is a great player and people want him so bad but because he has performed like shit for every club he has played for.
PhillyUnion,34yj2p,spqr-king,8,Tue May 5 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"People seem to forget this, and only look at him through rosy World Cup glasses.  You don't play for 9 clubs in 10 years without there being a reason for that."
PhillyUnion,34yj2p,spqr-king,2,Tue May 5 17:53:13 2015 UTC,Exactly im not saying he doesnt have raw skill but if your a toxic player it will come out in your club play and it has. The man has no passion or desire to play and we need to unload him as soon as possible so we can find someone with some love for this team and the city and the skills to take us to new levels.

PhillyUnion,34xu6c,ignoramis,-1,Wed May 6 22:57:53 2015 UTC,I guess just looking at the list our DP players are no where near the caliber of other players around the league but if we can remove them as soon as they are paid then its kind of a different story. They really have to get those two off DP status if they are planning on making any big name signings in the summer window like the rumors.

PhillyUnion,34upx7,EdBacon,6,Mon May 4 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"We really need midfield depth, and especially real wingers, before we need a striker. Not sure what the deal with their priorities has been if this pans out."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Mon May 4 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe the idea is someone who isn't strictly a poacher? Someone you can pair with him who sits further back allowing Fernando to push higher up? Fernando isn't fast enough for what we want him to do but he's deadly with his head and directly in front of goals. I think all of his goals have been poacher type goals.  That said I completely agree, a striker isn't something we need but I guess I can kinda see the thought process behind it."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,Mike81890,2,Mon May 4 18:51:15 2015 UTC,"I'm most worried its a move by the FO to reel in some more fans with a ""big"" name. Kinkead also says he has a World Cup pedigree. We really don't need to blow money on an aging player in the one position we have some semblance of depth at. We need solid role players every where else on the field far more than a marginal upgrade up top. I hope we're  not dealing with Rais 2.0 here...   That being said, I do have a soft spot in my heart for Peter Crouch... so it will be hard to hate him if he comes here.   edit: I see where you're coming from, and I suppose that wouldn't be a bad move. As it stands very little of our attack moves through the middle of the field, rather it gets funneled to the wings and then ineffectually crossed in to the one player (Nando) making any kind of run. So I guess I see the logic there, just feel like we could get more bang for our buck by upgrading the wings at this point."

Defense isn't sexy. You could probably get two decent defenders/midfielders for M'Bolhi's price and cap hit and then go with a more expensive/experienced veteran striker to lead the attack with Fernando at the front isn't the worst idea I've thought of.   As it stands very little of our attack moves through the middle of the field   We could use someone like Clint Dempsey. Look at the role he plays in Seattle. He's used as a forward (iirc) but Obafemi Martins plays further up top and Dempsey does a good job of not only scoring, but feeding the ball through the middle of the field to Martins. Almost like an attacking mid but even further up. That's the kind of player we need and it'll take the stress of the attack off the wings if we ever do sign someone.  edit: here's kinda what I mean  http://www.footballuser.com/formations/2015/05/1250730_Philadelphia_Union.jpg  4-1-3-2 but could be a 4-4-2 if you wanna throw another midfielder next to Chaco and use Pfeffer as a sub  another edit but the more I'm thinking about it, the more I like the idea of chaco > striker > fernando. Not only does this take a lot of the current focus off Fernando, but it opens the midfield up for attack (if new striker plays back a bit and Fernando acts as the poacher he is). Teams are able to shut Wenger and Fernando down because they are pretty much the funnel of our attack and Ayuk is young enough to attempt things others might not to push the ball forward into the box."

PhillyUnion,34upx7,MrChips217,1 point,Tue May 5 14:07:35 2015 UTC,"I threw it together quickly and completely forgot him. Whoops. :\  Him as a midfielder means we could run a pretty solid 4-4-2 if everyone is healthy and the striker rumors are true. That way you can keep CJ, Le Toux, and Casey as sub options which isn't terrible either.  This assumes everyone playing terribly gets their shit together and plays better than they have though so..."

PhillyUnion,34upx7,drsilentg,4,Tue May 5 03:11:41 2015 UTC,"We've got Ayuk, Aristeguieta, Sapong (maybe), Casey, and LeToux's best game this season was when he was tucked as a center forward behind Fernando. I'm not saying that all those guys are starters, but what the hell are we going to do with more depth up top? Union has one guy or less for any defensive position, and they want more attack? WTF?"
PhillyUnion,34upx7,jpoRS,4,Mon May 4 19:13:25 2015 UTC,I like ayuk alot. He can take guys on and win free kicks. Just need to work on crosses
PhillyUnion,34upx7,spqr-king,9,Mon May 4 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"He needs a lot of work all around, but he's shown more promise than several starters so I say let the man play."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,bmangan,0,Mon May 4 19:22:25 2015 UTC,I would say most 18-20 year old players require work lol
PhillyUnion,34upx7,jpoRS,2,Tue May 5 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"Well if we added a starting quality left back we'd have him, Sheannon and Ray at the fullback spots. Plus Mo, White, and Vitoria at the CB spots. Plus Williams can play CB and Marquez looked pretty solid to me against Toronto. Defensive depth is really a left back or two away."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,spqr-king,1 point,Mon May 4 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"If we add a LB, our Depth is Fabinho. Not ideal. On the right we have Williams vs. Gaddis, so that's not a problem, but of White, Vitoria, and Marquez I'm not sure there's a two full CBs to be had. I am not counting Mo because I can only assume that he is moving back to midfield if they aren't out looking for a DM.   So number of starter worthy players, left to right it's 1-0.75-0.75-2. Not exactly good news in my opinion."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,jpoRS,2,Mon May 4 22:04:24 2015 UTC,Marquez played fairly well if they dont ditch Fabinho for him I will cry...
PhillyUnion,34upx7,spqr-king,1 point,Tue May 5 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"He played well in one game. Lots to he hopeful about, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here.   That said, the choice between Fabinho and a ficus would be pretty simple, but other than a houseplant it's hard to imagine a bigger waste of roster space."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,jpoRS,2,Tue May 5 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"Im not saying he is the future of the club just that now we can put Fabinho where be belongs on the bench of a USL team somewhere or maybe just plant him, water him everyday, and hope he grows much like a ficus."

PhillyUnion,34upx7,spqr-king,1 point,Tue May 5 12:47:09 2015 UTC,"We probably would have seen Wenger/Unknown at LB if we didn't, especially with Sheanon's injuries."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,bmangan,0,Tue May 5 14:09:28 2015 UTC,Could Wenger really be worse?
PhillyUnion,34upx7,spqr-king,1 point,Tue May 5 14:17:48 2015 UTC,"I see it a little differently. If we add a starting quality left back we've got three starting quality fullbacks. Theres no real indication that Mo is gonna play DM so with Mo, Vitoria and White we have three starting caliber CBs plus Williams is an option at CB if needed. To me White has performed well in limited time this year and showed well last year. I'm not sure why people don't think he can start in this league. Vitoria has been one of our best additions, probably the best  outside of Aristeguieta and one of our most consistent players. There's only about two spots on a 7 man bench for defenders. If they go to Williams and White I trust both of them as much as anyone else on the team."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,jpoRS,1 point,Mon May 4 23:49:47 2015 UTC,Casey and Le Toux have been less than stellar and are aging fast... I would say we need a player like Edu who can fill a senior roll up top if we are going to keep Edu in the back rather than the midfield. That being said our possession went through the roof with him in the midfield...
PhillyUnion,34upx7,spqr-king,1 point,Tue May 5 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"Casey is doing most of what we expected of him. Need a goal in the last twenty minutes? He's got one in and threatened more than a few times, which is what you can expect from ""that guy"" on any roster.   LeToux is broken though, that's for sure. My point was though that he's a damn good fifth choice striker. So why would the Union look for (another) DP striker when that's the only position we have depth in as is?"
PhillyUnion,34upx7,dooper2010,0,Tue May 5 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about Casey as a lot of our other players when it comes to his form. I love his attitude but he is just not what we need to win. We need a refresh of most of our bench and some of our starters. Most teams are using aging superstars who are good now but at one point were top tier players our older guys the few we have were never superstars even in their prime and now they are just not what we need. I would rather have another guy like Sapong who has speed and height rather than Casey. I love his commitment and his attitude but he is just not what the team needs if they want to win. Casey, Le Toux, Wenger, Fabinho and a few other player really need to go despite how I feel about them personally. Fabinho the ficus really needs to go..."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,brain_smart,3,Tue May 5 12:09:20 2015 UTC,"If we sign a legit left-footed starting left back, then trade Fabinho for allocation $."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,spqr-king,2,Mon May 4 23:37:45 2015 UTC,To who though? I assume everyone has seen what he can/can't do. Would anyone be willing to pay for him?

PhillyUnion,34upx7,dooper2010,6,Tue May 5 03:07:55 2015 UTC,I hope we don't buy him from ourselves.
PhillyUnion,34upx7,Keepa1,1 point,Tue May 5 04:31:22 2015 UTC,The Union believed (maybe incorrectly) he had value and protected him in the expansion draft.  Trade him to whoever they think might value him or if another team's LB goes down injured.  Whatever they can get would be a plus at that point and put the $ towards the new LB

PhillyUnion,34upx7,Timothy-H,2,Mon May 4 21:42:07 2015 UTC,Heath Pearce could be a good LB pick up for depth. He played with Orlando recently and about 10 other clubs and has USMNT experience if I recall could be picked up for a steal.

PhillyUnion,34upx7,yung_swagged_out_mf,2,Tue May 5 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"This has been said many times, but I think by far the biggest hole on our team right now is at winger/wide midfield. With Wenger and Le Toux having both forgotten how to play soccer we're basically expecting all of our offense to come from Nando or Maidana. Sapong has been good, but who knows when he'll be back after his DUI. I love Ayuk's tenacity, but it's asking way too much of an 18 year old kid to bail out a sinking team. I see some people bashing LaHoud, but he's been playing the best soccer of his career and and I think he's far from our biggest issue. The defense hasn't looked good at all but we haven't been able to keep possession for shit, so we've been absorbing a TON of pressure all season. Of course we're gonna give up goals. You can't expect a defense to absorb pressure for 70% of the game and not give up a goal. On top of that we've started 6 different guys along the back line in as many variations. Not exactly giving us much opportunity to gel. That, and if we have wingers than can help us keep possession we wont have to lean so heavily on our defense to be constantly absorbing the pressure. We know Nando can score when he's getting good service. Maidana and Nogueria are great in the midfield when they have the space to work. We need speedy wingers to stretch the defense so that our counterattack can have room to breath and develop. It'd be great if they could also play in quality crosses for Nando to get on the end of, because we KNOW he can head the shit out of a well served ball. If the defense has no fear of being beaten over the top they can play compact in the midfield and leave us with no room to pass. Another DP striker to pair with Nando would be great. A true LB would be awesome, but until we have real wingers or wide midfielders they're not going to solve the problem.   TL;DR We don't need a DP striker or a new LB. We need actual wingers or wide midfielders."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,pefsu13,3,Tue May 5 14:22:17 2015 UTC,we don't need a striker we need someone that will put Lahoud back into his rightful spot on the bench
PhillyUnion,34upx7,dooper2010,1 point,Mon May 4 22:03:23 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure why we haven't moved to trade for Corey Ashe in the past year since Beasley was signed. Unless the asking price was exorbitant, there's no reason we shouldn't be interested in signing him. If we're looking outside of the league, I'm honestly not sure who to look at, but someone experienced (probably late 20s) who can help on both sides of the ball is needed."
PhillyUnion,34upx7,gregzorian,1 point,Tue May 5 02:23:32 2015 UTC,It would be nice if Nog and Chaco could actually spend time on the field together.  By my count they have spent 130 minutes out of 900 this season on the field together - 14.4% of the time.  Get them out there together consistently and I think it will raise everyone a bit and our ball possession %'s will improve.

The best bet is to get a few ideas and go to an away match or open cup match. On a regular match day there is way too much shit going on for anyone to try to learn anything more than a 2 liner. At an Open Cup or Away match you get a smaller crowd who actually care about support(my experience is only 50% tops are actually in the SS to be part of the support) and are willing to try things. If people like it, then you have a group of people to help get it started at a regular home match.

PhillyUnion,34s1q0,drewuke,0,Mon May 4 03:52:44 2015 UTC,That really doenst mean anything considering he is apart of the team for the foreseeable future...
PhillyUnion,34s1q0,spqr-king,1 point,Mon May 4 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"Gold Cup. Unless Edu suddenly is back on the National Team, we will be the same team. NY2 will not be."
PhillyUnion,34s1q0,jpoRS,0,Mon May 4 22:56:48 2015 UTC,We lose Blake and they still have Villa who is a head and shoulder above Edu if we are honest.
PhillyUnion,34s1q0,spqr-king,1 point,Mon May 4 23:04:08 2015 UTC,They have Villa when he isn't injured. We can't pretend he's some spring chicken that will bounce back from injury.  And I'm not as high on Blake as everyone else. so that's why I failed to mention him.
PhillyUnion,34s1q0,jpoRS,0,Tue May 5 00:37:11 2015 UTC,But your high on McCarthy or you think we will be getting another keeper.
PhillyUnion,34s1q0,spqr-king,1 point,Tue May 5 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"I expect (hope) Blake will be better than McCarthy, I just am not sure that Blake is the end of our worries. I remember him being promising but not there yet last season. Which is fine and good for a second stringer, but I wouldn't want last-year-Blake as our starter. That said, with an offseason's worth of training, I do think he will be more than serviceable. My worry is that our rough back line will test any keeper, so ""more than serviceable"" may not be good enough."
PhillyUnion,34s1q0,jpoRS,0,Tue May 5 01:25:28 2015 UTC,I think the biggest positive about him is he is an international level goal keeper meaning he plays on a big stage at times which is something we can only say about 3 of our players as far as I know. He will develop well as long as this injury doesnt hinder him.
PhillyUnion,34s1q0,spqr-king,9,Tue May 5 01:34:46 2015 UTC,"I went to the NYCFC game today, sat with Third Rail. I can tell you that their team is actually pretty dope and can bring the fight as they dominated the game against Seattle, however due to terrible calls (of course) it really hurt them.  I can also say that the team works really well in the midfield and back line. All of the goals that I saw down on the end line near Third Rail can be credited to some dizzying passing that caught them off, but they were solid otherwise. I think the problem that they're having on the front line is that they're just too eager to score a goal and not looking at what's around them. I can't count the times that mix was unmarked at the top of the box and whomever had the ball just decided to take a shot instead.  NYC had us beat both times this year and it was only due to fantastic luck that we walked away with a full 3 points from them at home.  I'd say though that neither team is better than the other at this point, but once NYC's players finish gelling, they'll be dominant."

PhillyUnion,34nwaf,Dean_Moriarty,9,Sat May 2 22:22:30 2015 UTC,"The ennui of failure has set in. Lower your expectations folks. This team is going nowhere until the culture established by the FO changes.   There's not much else to say in that regard. We have the same discussion week after week and year after year. Find a real GM, find a real coach, actually invest in facilities for the players, fire Sack and force Sugarman to sell the team. I think that covers the usual.   The only positive I saw was some formerly unseen young players get time. Marquez looks solid, and he and White can be considered serious defensive depth behind Edu and Vittoria which will at least give some tactical  flexibility for instances when Edu can move into midfield. Pfeffer had a better game and will hopefully develop into a serviceable central midfielder. I've heard he can play the wings as well, so that's promising. Ayuk, while pacey, needs to work on his passing and service. He gets his head up but doesn't have the precision to play a dangerous ball in. Wenger was worse than useless, literally a body taking up space on the left wing. He needs some serious time away from PPL.   edit: btw ""bardge"" is spelled incorrectly as there is no ""d"" - ""barge"" and its not a barge, its a container ship. A barge is generally non-powered and has to be towed or pushed by a tug boat."

PhillyUnion,34nwaf,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Sun May 3 01:37:42 2015 UTC,"When you say ""can't keep a cool head,"" do you mean stay composed in front of goal, or control his temper? I'm not sure I'd even agree with either. He's one of the more even tempered players on the team, even when he's understandably frustrated. Sure, he's not afraid to express his opinion with the referees and other players but he's always been respectful about it. And finishing hasn't been a problem for him, even if the goals are disallowed. All I'm saying is he's been targeted and hacked at game after game because defenders know he's our only real goalscoring threat at the moment. He publicly expressed his frustration with it, and these defenders are very aware of this fact and are using it to their advantage."
PhillyUnion,34nwaf,midwesternhousewives,2,Sun May 3 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"I actually think he has great composure, which is why he's a great finisher.  He's way to vocal with the referees and opposing players, however. I understand he was thrown a bit at the beginning because of how much physical play goes ""uncalled"" in MLS. But he knows that's the way it is, and it's not going to change for St. Nando if it hasn't changed for anyone else. He needs to just pipe down, put his head down and be the scoring machine he can be."
PhillyUnion,34nwaf,mtommyboy,12,Sun May 3 04:18:57 2015 UTC,We didn't completely suck. I expected far worse to be quite honest. Altidore and Bradley were largely quiet this game so props to the defense. That free kick should've been saved I think though.  Also  WE WANT BLAKE

Ayuk, White, McCarthy, Marquez, Pfeffer, and Aristequeta all have less than 15 starts for the Union.   Where are our senior players? Where is our depth? Where are our leaders? I would be shocked if half of our starters saw the gameday 18 of any playoff-bound mls team this year.   As fans we put butts in the seats for every game. ~ 18,000 of em. I just don't understand how teams like Dallas and Columbus and even Chicago can field better teams. Why aren't investors lining up to put some money into our team? We have the city, stadium, and fan-base of a major market. just not the ownership.   /vent"
PhillyUnion,34nwaf,Dean_Moriarty,3,Sat May 2 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"We're middle of the pack in spending, but with no real GM or coherent strategy coming from the coaching staff most of our purchases are... not as well thought out as they could be. Plus you had Sak with his hands in the pot pretending at GMing for the first four years and all the disasters that were caused as a result. And honestly, I won't believe Sak is out of personnel decisions until there's some real proof of him no longer associating with the new signings.  Basically, the Union aren't really ""cheap"" compared to other MLS sides, they're just very poor at deciding how to spend the money they do have.   As far as getting the team sold, that's on Sugarman, and right now I don't know that there's any move to sell. Rumor had it that the team was on the block in 2012, and got several offers, all of which were turned down as the ownership's asking price was too high. So even if they want to sell there may need to be some real extenuating circumstances to get ownership down to a realistic value."

PhillyUnion,34nwaf,zmbieslayer,2,Sat May 2 22:09:05 2015 UTC,Agreed on all accounts. Makes me wonder if Ray had a better game because he was at RB again. Curtin just said he likes Ray there and that's where he'll play the rest of the year.

PhillyUnion,34o8i9,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sun May 3 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be surprised if he got fired but it would be incredibly dumb.  Curtin and his staff could certainly have done things better, but he isn't the problem. The problem is obviously Sak and Sugarman.   First blame goes to Sak all these years for failing at roster composition.  It's not like the team hasn't spent money at all, for the most part they just spent it in incredibly dumb ways.  Second blame goes to Sugarman, for giving Sak such a long leash and also for being unwilling to spend a little bit more money to fix the problem.    And if we are now to believe that Sak no longer has anything to do with the personnel side, and after seeing this M'Bolhi thing play out I think I am willing to believe that's true, then the problem might already be solved.  But unfortunately the roster with cap space and all was just so poorly constructed that it is going to take time to correct.  Curtin definitely has room to improve and grow as a coach, but he seems to me to be the first intelligent coach we've ever had. I'd rather give him and Albright time to learn on the job and fix the roster themselves than do another mid-season interim clean house thing again."
PhillyUnion,34o8i9,Mike81890,3,Sun May 3 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"I just had a thought, but it feels awfully like when Hackworth had to clean up after Nowak. Obviously in that case you had a guy who could not coach at the level needed in MLS, and Hackworth was still apparently beholden to Sak in regards to some personnel moves. However, we have to now believe Curtin is the guy to clean up and rebuild after Sak took his hands off building the roster. I think that's a very tall order for a guy so untested. I'm willing to give him time though, if for no other reason than I don't think he's the biggest problem the team faces and firing him won't solve anything. So if he gets the year and can make enough positive changes for next season, fantastic. If not, then we really have to clean house from top to bottom to turn things around."

But it's so easy to say who you don't want and more difficult to say who you do and I think the complaining, however valid it may be, doesn't really say anything because it doesn't offer any solutions.

This organization doesn't know greatness. They don't know proper cap management, player management, or how to fucking pave a goddamned parking lot or give the players a legitimate weight room among other important facilities. For fuckssake it took 5 years to get dedicated training fields instead of having to travel to a fucking park to practice.  This organization is a joke.

PhillyUnion,34oeh2,EdBacon,1 point,Sun May 3 19:22:23 2015 UTC,At this point becoming Chivas USA would be a good thing. At least MLS would buy Sugarman out and force a change in ownership.
PhillyUnion,34oeh2,EdBacon,0,Sun May 3 01:38:22 2015 UTC,how long is that going to take? We have to wait till attendance dies down to chivas levels? We are just gonna sit on our hands until then. I mean I want to do something and I can't not buy tickets because this is my passion. Do we petition the league to take away the Union from the owners?

They're content with the money they make off of the suburbanite soccer moms and dads taking little jimmy to the soccer match because he likes soccer .  There's nothing wrong with those people, but the FO doesn't care about the rest of us because of it.  The only way I could see anything changing their mind is if there was legit competition putting a quality product on the field to start pulling away those people and drawing in the more hard line supporters.  It all comes down to hurting them in their pocket books, and us boycotting anything they do isn't going to hurt them because we're not their target demo."

PhillyUnion,34nw6y,drewuke,9,Sat May 2 22:03:07 2015 UTC,Getting rid of Curtin solves nothing. You'd just be promoting Albright or Sorber. The issue is the ownership of this team isn't interested in soccer.

PhillyUnion,34nw6y,jpoRS,5,Sun May 3 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"We need to clean house at this point. Basically start over from square 1 with a small core group of players (Fernando, Maidana, Blake, maybe Edu...)  We can get rid of Curtin but what's that going to accomplish? It's going to be the same thing again this year, we might get a small bounce with a new coach (who would be Albright or someone inside the organization) until we miss the playoffs again and the team decides to appoint the interim manager to the full time position.  We need to look up top. Curtin isn't the biggest problem here. Sak and Sugarman who refuse to do anything with this team are problems number 1 and 2. We don't even have the proper facilities for fucks sake. Our parking lots aren't even completely paved. There is no standard weight room, we don't have a gm and we finally stopped having to go to a fucking park to practice."
PhillyUnion,34nw6y,spqr-king,4,Sat May 2 22:12:57 2015 UTC,"If spqr-king was the owner he would...   -Keep Curtain while searching for a better coach then demote him to assistant. (Petke?)  -Get rid of older players playing below MLS skill level Fabinho, Carrol, Casey, and others would be gone or loaned out I appreciate their contribution but its time.  -Fire Sak nothing he has done have improved the team if anything it has gotten much much worse and ignoring his contribution is beyond stupid.   -Get back in touch with the fans I would be in the Rivers End every match.  -Rather than picking up two DP players like Bradley and Altidore pick up 4 or 5 slightly below DP level players in positions of need like we did with Nando."
PhillyUnion,34nw6y,jpoRS,6,Sat May 2 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said, except for Casey. He's fine as a depth player, and he's only getting paid depth money. He may not be the shiniest screwdriver, but he's still a useful tool to have in the tool chest."

PhillyUnion,34nw6y,goatyhead,2,Sun May 3 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"The way I feel about him (and a few other guys) is they are low-priority problems. Michael Lahoud is not good enough, but there are a dozen things that need to be addressed before we get to those types of guys."
PhillyUnion,34nw6y,EdBacon,0,Sun May 3 01:52:33 2015 UTC,I agree that was just a short list of the changes that should be made. I would say 40% of our players are not MLS starting or bench material but we keep them around because its convenient.

PhillyUnion,34l27m,spqr-king,3,Sat May 2 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"Even so, I wouldn't say he's completely not at fault if hes driving using drugs prescribed to him. You're explicitly told not to drive when on heavy painkillers and the like"
PhillyUnion,34l27m,bterre108,3,Sat May 2 05:36:31 2015 UTC,That's true but it is a little more in his character as far as everyone saying he is such a great guy. I mean either way he needs some kind of punishment but I would understand it more if it was pain meds. It's doubtful though.
PhillyUnion,34l27m,spqr-king,2,Sat May 2 14:41:59 2015 UTC,That is very true and I was thinking about it a couple of minutes ago. I really hope that it isn't alcohol but if it turns out that it is then I really hope he's benched for the rest of the season because fuck drunk driving and fuck letting this team down.
PhillyUnion,34l27m,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Sat May 2 03:24:14 2015 UTC,Yea no joke I mean he would have been prescribed something heavy for the pain that being said if it was alcohol thats a huge problem and will be a test of Curtains coaching chops because lets be honest we need the guy. I agree though he should be benched for awhile but im sure the league will do something as well.  Also its the fact that they said this morning that is throwing me off was it 1am or 9am those are two very different mornings...

Ayuk has definitely earned a starting spot and I guess this also implies that Aristeguieta is healthy enough to go, which is huge. Pfeffer will be back from national play and is hopefully sharp, since Nogueira is still recovering. We've got to widen our attack and provide better service in to Sapong and Nando. I hope this formula is more successful."

PhillyUnion,34aq6n,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:50:41 2015 UTC,The only thing that I'm worried about now is the fact that Vitoria is sidelined and unlikely to start on Saturday. Looking like an edu white pairing it seems. Thankfully it'll be pfeffer instead of Carroll in the midfield. Happy though overall that Jim is finally making a serious lineup change.
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,get_down_mrpresident,5,Wed Apr 29 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"I think he's making changes he's wanted to make for awhile but, due to the injury status of players and national duty, etc, hasn't been able to. If Fernando could've played in Columbus, that alone would have allowed for a very different line up.   I didn't realize Vitoria will be sidelined. I mean, he's played every minute so far this season, so that's understandable anyway. White makes me nervous, but having Mo next to him eases my concerns a bit."

He just made some really questionable decisions in the early games this season in terms of distribution, marking (or lack thereof), etc. Maybe with Mo there to help him, he can be better. Vitoria isn't exactly something special and he's played much better with Edu beside him, so maybe the captain can do the same in this situation. Also, Williams over Fabinho has got to make that backline better. It's humanly impossible for it not to."

PhillyUnion,34aq6n,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"I meant that White isn't playing because Edu-Vitoria is a better combo, not that he's necessarily that bad."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,yung_swagged_out_mf,2,Thu Apr 30 19:36:39 2015 UTC,Edu-White was a fine backline pairing last year.
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,FlapjackJackson,6,Wed Apr 29 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"Dunno if this will get us a win, but it's a change and right now that's what this team and our lineup needs. Ayuk, Sapong, and Nando put in more effort than most it seems, and they deserve to start. With Blake still out we'll see McCarthy in goal, but that's not a big problem to me. He just needs more playing time and discipline. Not like we really have a choice anyways."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,Too_many_hippos,3,Wed Apr 29 19:47:21 2015 UTC,"McCarthy in net actually really worries me.  I like the kid and all, but he is not ready for the MLS if his Columbus game showed anything.  We could have played with an extra man in the field, without a keeper and the score would have been the same.    I'm hoping it was just a bad game, but those mistakes were BAD."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:53:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He did not look good out there against Columbus at all. Wasn't it 4 shots on goal and 4 goals?   I don't think he's really ready for MLS yet either, but like I said we don't have much of a choice and I'd rather have him than Mbholi.   Never thought we would have a GK problem like this a couple years ago."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,Too_many_hippos,3,Wed Apr 29 22:07:43 2015 UTC,"The main issue i have is them bunkering down and trying to play defense for an entire half when they have the momentum in the game. players returning from injuries, making changes in the line up mean nothing if that's how you're going to consistently play your games."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,pastecity,2,Wed Apr 29 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"Good. I'm glad Curtin is able to be flexible, even if (it seems like) it took getting destroyed by Columbus in order to change things up.   Hopefully Blake is healthy soon, looks like Curtin has all but confirmed that he'll start once he's completely healthy. I get why Curtin is being conservative with him, the last thing you want is another long term (or potentially career ending) injury."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,--smokeandmirrors--,5,Wed Apr 29 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"Because of injuries and national duties, Curtin hasn't really been able to change things up all that much even if he wanted to. His two mistakes last game though were underutilizing Ayuk and starting Fabinho over Williams. Unless there's something happening behind the scenes that we don't know about, Sheanon didn't deserve to be benched for the previous game. If anything, Gaddis was way worse (not saying to bench him either though)."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,thelostdolphin,2,Wed Apr 29 19:45:47 2015 UTC,Thats not really the side of the field im worried about.
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,spqr-king,5,Wed Apr 29 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with our defense is really an overall possession issue. Our opponents have the ball most of the game and get comfortably into an attacking rhythm, which overtaxes our back line and leads to guys getting beat or making mental mistakes in positioning. Hopefully these changes lead to more time with the ball. Even like 45% possession would be a step in the right direction."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,thelostdolphin,3,Wed Apr 29 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If we're feeling generous the back line is league average, so mistakes are going happen. The key to winning is keeping pressure off them so the mistakes are separated by more time."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,jpoRS,4,Wed Apr 29 22:21:25 2015 UTC,"But McCarthy probably still in goal. I like McCarthy, but starting him over Blake hurts everyone.   Also, Le Toux is forward depth at this point, no reason in continuing to play him out wide, and Wenger shouldn't even see the stadium this weekend."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,EdBacon,8,Wed Apr 29 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"Andre has been sharper in training. He did have, middle of last week – I don’t want to call it a setback, but he felt the knee, it was scary for him. Had a discussion with Paulo Grillo, our goalkeeping coach, yesterday and he sees what the rest of the staff sees in training, where Dre is getting closer to himself but he’s not quite there yet. Good for him today, he got to get 45 minutes against an opponent in Harrisburg and see some live action. While he wasn’t busy in the exercise, feel just to have crosses coming in, facing a couple corner kicks like he did, kicking the ball well, again it’s an injury situation where he’s coming back.   Looks like Blake isn't 100% quite yet. Curtin seems extra concerned with waiting until he's like 101% ready to come back which tells me a) he's running with a ""what's one more game"" kind of mentality and b) Blake is going to be the starter for the rest of this season and most likely long term so he doesn't want to push him out before he's ready."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Wed Apr 29 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"Well, he will be leaving in June for the Gold Cup which is an issue."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,FlapjackJackson,5,Wed Apr 29 19:17:13 2015 UTC,That's true. Good news is the Union have 3 games during that time but only one is during the group stages so if Jamaica doesn't advance through their group he could potentially be back for the game against Toronto on the 18th.
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"We don't have anyone else's word to go by, but Blake indicated he was ready to play two weeks ago. Suppose its still a nagging issue going by what was said in the press conference though. That's a shame. He couldn't start any sooner at this rate."
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,EdBacon,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:42:31 2015 UTC,And also this as further evidence:    It should be noted that Wenger & Le Toux are playing alongside deep reserves/academy kids. Might be a good clue they won't start Saturday.

PhillyUnion,34aq6n,oooooooounbelievable,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"I wrote out a long thingy but instead I'll just ask, once we get everyone healthy, how do we feel about Pfeffer as a narrow winger?"
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,oooooooounbelievable,2,Wed Apr 29 19:25:20 2015 UTC,"not too terrible sounding actually. Maidana needs to play as central as possible, so that could be a good solution. I kinda think Ayuk would do well as a massive upgrade to what Hoppenot used to do for us, come on late with a lot of speed but he can actually create chances and beat people. the problem is, we need someone who can start and do that for us as well, so maybe Pfeffer is a good shout"
PhillyUnion,34aq6n,TweetPoster,2,Wed Apr 29 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was thinking.  I can see Ayuk being better suited as a super sub.  Maidana, Nogueira, Pfeffer are the three best guys we have on the ball, and by that I mean their touch, passing, and ability to keep possession.    Get those three guys in the midfield together, maybe ask Williams to overlap more often to provide width, and try to setup Nando up top and Sapong crashing the far side of the box coming in from the opposite wing."
PhillyUnion,34arhz,spqr-king,2,Wed Apr 29 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"Take away:  -Vitoria is probable (Groin)  -Nogueira is still dealing with his ankle  -We dont need to be great to win just good at this point  -The team is not in ""must win"" mode yet which they should be  -Andre will probably not play this weekend he thinks he is ready but they want to be sure.  -Possession was a disaster no kidding  -Carroll was dealing with a serious hamstring injury vs. Columbus and still started over Ethan White."
PhillyUnion,34a21m,beggarb,3,Wed Apr 29 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"Fascinating read.  It's so infuriating that the Union seem to do all the right things off the pitch to be a class organization, but on the pitch it is such a gong show."
PhillyUnion,349tui,MrChips217,5,Wed Apr 29 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"Oh but NYCFC was just missing Villa... I mean come on half of our team is missing Nogs, Pfeffer, Nando between that and the goalkeeper drama how the hell are we supposed to win anything when half of our team on the field is MIA as well Wenger, Le Toux, and multiple other players are not in any type of competitive form. We really earned that spot."
PhillyUnion,349tui,spqr-king,3,Wed Apr 29 13:20:46 2015 UTC,how the hell are we supposed to win anything when half of our team on the field is MIA   Well it helps if the other half that has been playing isn't also MIA.
PhillyUnion,349tui,drewuke,0,Wed Apr 29 15:42:25 2015 UTC,I think if Curtain should have cleaned house on our subs and in other places honestly but he was going with what he was familiar with hopefully he fixes this in the summer window.

Aren't we supposed to get louder and engage MORE when the team is struggling?   The only songs I ended up hearing were chants of ""Why aren't we singing?""  It was a shitty day, sure, but how about some pride in defeat?"
PhillyUnion,345yhh,Mike81890,3,Tue Apr 28 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened last season, it would just die out after a while. It was sad but kinda reflects our team"
PhillyUnion,345yhh,Davidmm18,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:22:14 2015 UTC,I'd say the fans reflect the team in this sense. But chicken and egg argument I guess.

PhillyUnion,345yhh,spqr-king,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:05:51 2015 UTC,I'm not blaming the fans. I get it we see our team time and time again lose. When you go down you feel the loss coming it's hard to stay loud.
PhillyUnion,345yhh,rabidfrodo,2,Wed Apr 29 03:17:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard but it's something that any of the other groups have no problem with. We've stopped singing for our team when they're losing since 2010.  Then again my section hardly ever sings. The corner areas can't hear the capos much, so it's usually me trying to piece out what we're doing, and losing my voice every game trying to get the section going.  We need need need more capo stands."
PhillyUnion,345yhh,xenoletum,14,Wed Apr 29 12:43:06 2015 UTC,"Well I don't think that, at least here, we turn on each other. Everyone here and in the match threads on /r/MLS seem to be in at least a majority of an agreement. We all blame the ownership of the team, not each other.   I do think that sometimes people can get a little harsh on the more casual fans who go to PPL park for the first time because we see it as just supporting this FO that clearly isn't going to do anything to improve the team and the franchise. Those of us who are more diehard fans that go to matches often, watch every game on TV or MLSLive get disappointed because it feels like we're the ones suffering since money is just coming in regardless of how the team performes. We want this team to survive in Philly and become a real contender in the league. And it doesn't ever feel like change or improvements are coming.  I go back and forth nearly every week or every few days about how I feel about this team. Sometimes I get angry (usually after matches) because it feels like another slap in the face. I'm a fan, I go to matches and spend money, I plan my weekend days around a soccer game and this is what I get out of it? Another loss? Another day seeing us drop down the table?  But then there are other days when I feel great. I love some of these players for their work rate, their love of the city, fans, and the team no matter how shit it gets. Philly is a really unique place in sports. We don't really have the best teams or at least not for very long, we are harsh and rowdy to other team's players and fans and are pretty harsh and rowdy to our own. But in the end we can't help but love them. Our teams and the players who are a part of them get branded when they come to Philly. It's not a brand you can see, but one you can feel. When Cliff Lee turned down money from the Yankees to come back to Philly we loved him even more than we did before, when our Flyers were known as the Broad Street Bullies we cheered on their ""Philly Toughness"", and when Conor Casey of the Union said he would take less money so he could stay in Philly my appreciation of him grew exponentially.   It's really easy for us to be harsh on each other because that's what Philly sports is: a harsh place. But we all, deep down, love each other and our teams. Through failures, victories, and even more failures we stick by them because they represent us and our city and we can't not love someone who does that.   TL;DR We're Philly, we're tough on each other, but we're also full of love for each other and no matter how bad the Union may be I wouldn't want to cheer on anyone else."

MLS paid $70 million to takeover Chivas, after all."
PhillyUnion,33vryd,--smokeandmirrors--,5,Sun Apr 26 03:59:39 2015 UTC,Well if you wanted to make a real investment you would either build the youth program then sell the players or build the team into a successful team to raise the value and then sell it. You dont want a minimal return on investment you want as much as you can get so I dont know I think they are just shit owners and managers.

PhillyUnion,33vryd,Too_many_hippos,2,Sun Apr 26 12:53:18 2015 UTC,Im a business major so investing is kinda my thing lol I see what they are doing and cringe because they could make so much more money making a successful team in a city that really does not have right now. Instead they are fucking it all up and trying to cut corners to make a minimal profit.

PhillyUnion,33xlz7,4-1-3-2,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:53:22 2015 UTC,The only way we get in is if we sneak in as the 6th seed since MLS thought we should expand to 6 teams per conference for fuck all reason. So a pick up or two over the summer transfer window and a hot run over the summer could propel us. I mean we just need to finish like we did last year and we're in  Not that I think that's gonna actually happen cuz everyone seems so disinterested and the team is in horrible shape but that's the only way it happens.
PhillyUnion,33xlz7,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:54:27 2015 UTC,It COULD happen but the summer window would have to be HUGE. Like spending more money than we ever have huge. Like Petr Cech in goal and a fantastic LB would do wonders with a healthy starting group.

When have we had access to our healthy best XI this year? Nogueira, Maidana, and Sapong have not been healthy at the same time this year. It's how we have ended up starting Fred and Carroll. We are certain to see some improvement when we get our best players back.  If we sell MBolhi, that gives us financial room to bring in some reinforcements in areas of need. A new winger, DM, and LB would do wonders for this team.  Unfortunately, none of this will be enough, but those would be reasons for hope."
PhillyUnion,33xlz7,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"We had a dismal entire first half of the season last year and still came very close to getting into the playoffs. Our USOC run spread us thin and affected our end of regular season performance, but assuming we don't have another big run in that and can focus solely on MLS and with an east that seems to be weaker than last year overall and more playoff spots, and a team with some roster upgrades (Fernando, Vitoria, Sapong) it's not completely crazy to think we still could sneak in."
PhillyUnion,33xlz7,thelostdolphin,3,Mon Apr 27 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"We didn't make the playoffs, or win the USOC for that matter, because we lacked depth. As far as I can see, this year is no different. It may even be worse."

I guess it's therapeutic and a good way of just letting off steam to complain over and over, but I can only tolerate so much before I feel like either you still find ways to enjoy the long season in front of us, or you really put your money where your mouth is and abandon the team, or at least the current state of it until it changes rather than having your cake and eating it too (complaining, continuing to follow the team, complaining some more, ad nauseum).   I'm excited about Ayuk and some of the other young guys we may see this season, I'm happy with the acquisitions we made in the offseason, I'm glad to see us recognize early this season that M'Bohli isn't the answer rather than having a whole season of nonsense.   I just really really want to see the real team we had assembled in preseason and played with for a total of 45 mins of the first game of the season and then really make an assessment of our prospects. I want to see Sapong and Fernando firing on all cylinders with Ayuk in the starting squad, Blake over McCarthy for now, etc and really have an understanding of what needs to be done to right the ship."

PhillyUnion,33vfue,EdBacon,12,Sun Apr 26 12:50:10 2015 UTC,"Things to think about:  -This team has about 6-7 legitimate starters when everyone is healthy. The rest of the roster is good for depth on a good day. Players like Wenger and Fabinho wouldn't even see the stadium on gameday on most successful MLS sides.  -Curtin's body language is horrible. No communication with players, and no indication he even cares whats happening. Compare that to when he started last year where he was animated and standing almost the whole time. This is not a good sign, and you have to wonder if his confidence is shot at this point.   -At what point does the ownership group sell the team? What exactly are they waiting for? I think its become abundantly clear that Sugarman and Co. were in this deal to make an investment, not build a successful sports franchise, so what needs to happen for them to move on? I was thinking the financing on the expansion fee and stadium might have to be paid off? I really don't know, but the team is treading water financially and with our losing reputation it can't be boosting the team's value, so what needs to give?   post game edit: I think the fans should demand an apology for that shit show. There needs to be a concerted effort to remove Sak and push for new management."
PhillyUnion,33vfue,stw77,2,Sun Apr 26 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"My issue with Curtin is that he seems to want to play possession based soccer, but does not have the players for it. Our team has players that might be more fit for a counter play style. Yet somehow we are so slow on the counter. We really lack any distinct play style other than shit. He also seems unable to prepare the team for each match. Today it looked like there was no gameplan. He had a week and knew that some of his key players would be out. It seems like he did not try and adjust the gameplan for the guys he had to use today. I like Curtin and wish he would succeed, but I really do not think he will. It it is time for an experienced manager and better ownership. Neither of those two will happen probably so I at least hope we invest in a left back and either a new winger or center midfielder."
PhillyUnion,33vfue,EdBacon,11,Sun Apr 26 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"Curtin has explicitly said he wants to play counterattacking football.   At this point I think he's just thinking of what excuses he needs to make each week, then picking 11 players at random and seeing what happens."
PhillyUnion,33vfue,stw77,2,Sun Apr 26 01:22:58 2015 UTC,Its amazing that he wants to play counterattacking football yet we suck at countering. Everyone is so slow on transition. It really does seem like he is just picking random players and hoping for the best.

Also, you are very much correct in that the owners were making more of an investment rather than a sports franchise. What I see as needing to happen in order to fix this is to have someone from the Philly area buy the team and rebuild it. That is the only way I see it improving right now. I'll talk to some people about it if I see them but I can make no guarantees that I, a semi broke college student, can convince some rich dude of anything to do with money."

Whether it be a late collapse or a BTFO like tonight.   It's so god damn frustrating to watch this every week now. I see people comparing us to being the new Chivas and while I still don't agree with it, it slowly becomes more and more agreeable after every game. If I didn't already buy tickets to a match later this year I wouldn't be going to a single match all season. This is inexcusable.  We need to do something.

M'Bohli was supposed to be the stopgap over the next couple seasons while either Blake or McCarthy grew into the long-term starting role. Obviously with Rais being a bust, the idea is for one of those two (likely Blake) to take the starting spot a bit earlier than was originally planned."
PhillyUnion,33vff5,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:34:11 2015 UTC,He was pretty bad.
PhillyUnion,33vff5,gregzorian,7,Sun Apr 26 14:12:16 2015 UTC,He wasnt a superstar for us but he also got left out to dry by a defense who just couldn't mark people.
PhillyUnion,33vff5,_axaxaxax,2,Sun Apr 26 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"How do you figure exactly? He didn't have a good defense last year in front of him and defense plays a huge role in a goalkeeper's performance. Now I'm not saying he should take over Howard's spot on the national team, but he has been rapidly improving season after season. Sometimes you just have to let your young players play in order for them to develop. Look at Gaddis. Ray got so much flack his first season here, because he was young, lacking experience, and wasn't as good as Williams, or the recently departed Jordan Harvey. Now look at him. He's one our best players at the moment and has proved to be an effective wing back."
PhillyUnion,33vff5,jabrodo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:50:13 2015 UTC,"I ge tthat players improve but, I don't think Zac had it. He was a decent shot stopper, but never seemed to figure out when to go go out of net or when to stay put or when to go halfway (something mccarthy is even worse at--he's just shouldn't be on the field). Command of the area on crosses was also poor, wasn't able to plow through and punch away when needed. As for improving, I really don't think he improved that much at all from when he first started. As for Gaddis, he still gets beat since he doesn't know where to position himself. He saves himself a lot with speed, which he always had. Not every young player is going to improve."
PhillyUnion,33vff5,gregzorian,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:47:30 2015 UTC,Statistically he was slightly below average but was only 24. Goalkeepers don't peak until their late 20s early 30s and it's pretty certain he would have been an above average keeper for a not crazy price for years to come. It doesn't make sense to invest that kind of time in a below average keeper unless you are going to see the other side. That's the tragedy here. The fans had to endure the investment without the return.
PhillyUnion,33vff5,beggarb,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"They were trying to unload MacMath before the 2014 season even began. There wasn't any interest, which is why he was still on the roster when we selected Andre Blake in the draft and brought on Rais as a stopgap for a couple years while Blake (or possibly McCarthy) grew into the position."
PhillyUnion,33vff5,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"""statistically"" doesn't make sense. can't judge a goalie by cleans sheets or goals allowed. you have to judge him on what he does and the decisions he makes and the positions he is put in.  He wasn't really an investment except in playing time, which isn't such a bad thing because when he first started one might have reasonably thought that he would improve, but after the time we gave him you could see he still had the same problems (in my other comment). What you have to determine is ""was playing macmath the best option"", not ""was it good or bad"" since its possible it was the lesser of several evils. more specifically you have to determine ""does this decision, in combination with the other decisions we make, make the union the best it can be within the given budget"". Maybe there was no one else available on the market at the time. mabye there were people, but the fo would have had to make some moves they didn't want to make at the time. the point is, business-wise it's really a lot complex and we can't judge because we don't know the finances. As for on the field performance, I'm not that let down by at least the macmath side of this goalie calamity. We gave a young guy some time, he improved in certain ways but it was made clear that he wasn't gonna cut it especially in an improving mls, and so we moved him on, never having paid him all that much."
PhillyUnion,33vff5,gregzorian,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:40:35 2015 UTC,"You are wrong about statistics. If you look at the MLS statistics of Guzan, Howard, Sean Johnson, Bill Hamid (Keepers with impressive careers and/or upside) they stand out statistically from the rest. MacMath did/does not. So while there is no perfect science you can gauge effectiveness and project careers based on data. If you want I can send you some links to read through on this."

PhillyUnion,33ro5g,MrChips217,2,Fri Apr 24 23:41:37 2015 UTC,Islanders 1 Independence 1.  Pretty much awful soccer neither team looked good. The first half was pretty dominant by the Independence with their wing backs getting forward and putting a lot of pressure on the Islanders. The second half was much better from the Islanders switching from a 4-4-2/4-5-1 to a 4-3-3 and maintaining most of the possession.   Jimmy McLaughlin Played the 90. He looked decent in attack and drew numerous double teams when he received the ball. He won a number of corners for the Islanders. He also had a great opportunity blocked by a last ditch effort that lead to the corner the Islanders scored on to equalize. Although McLaughlin had a decent game it is concerning that on numerous occasions he was reluctant to go to his left and use his left foot. Dzenan Catic Started off in the 4-4-2 up top and looked like he was the lone striker in a 4-5-1 for most of the first half. He was very isolated. Catic had very little oppurtunity in possesion as most of the balls that were played to him were wild long balls in a 2-v-1 or 3-v-1. The second half looked better with more options forward for him but he was subbed off in the 75'.
PhillyUnion,33ro5g,akuller,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:21:16 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for this. I just watched a bit and it seemed like just constant heavy touches and easy giveaways the whole time.  I'm really curious to see what Catic can do with good service. He looks kinda slow though.
PhillyUnion,33qilh,midwesternhousewives,6,Fri Apr 24 17:59:43 2015 UTC,"To stay positive, I still think we have a pretty good team if we weren't so injury plagued and/or not getting screwed over by the ref.  We literally have only had all of our best players available for one half this season, and that was the first half of the first game.  If we can get healthy, we can be a very competitive team."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sat Apr 25 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, the ""worst team in the league"" dialogue is just inaccurate. But if it means teams could sleep on us and drop easy points, I'm okay with it."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,jpoRS,2,Sat Apr 25 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"I really want to see us play a more balanced mix of offense and defense in both halves. We can still concede possession, but we can't concede it all in huge junks because it gives our opponents more and more rhythm and confidence, which inevitably leads to break downs and goals (SKC, NE).   As for the lineup, with Noguiera and Pfeffer out, let's hope that Maidana is at or at least very close to 100%. We're also going to need Lahoud and Carroll to be competent.  Both McLaughlin and Catic have been loaned to Harrisburg for their next match, so they're not options.   With Ayuk rested, let's hope he's good for close to 90 and for him to play decent defense and provide some good service to Fernando in the box since no one else seems capable of providing that at the moment.  Blake isn't yet ready to start, so another game of McCarthy. Not too worried about that as long we don't attempt again to park the bus for 45 minutes straight.   To answer the question posed, What do you think needs to be done to get the W in Columbus? Aside from my point about not parking the bus the whole second half, I think Sapong is the guy to look to this match. He's gotta be pissed about his blown chances in the last match, feeling better after a week's rest, and ready to be the offensive spark in Columbus."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,thelostdolphin,3,Fri Apr 24 19:36:45 2015 UTC,We're also going to need... Carroll to be competent.   It's 2015. Can you believe we're still talking about this?

PhillyUnion,33qilh,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"What he can do well has narrowed so much though. He can't complete a forward pass, and that's a huge problem."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,EdBacon,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's definitely limited in what he can contribute. Just saying that, when thinking about all of the deadweight on our bench, there are a number of people I'm surprised we're still talking about in 2015 more than I am Carroll."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,thelostdolphin,2,Sat Apr 25 16:07:41 2015 UTC,Oh god the lineup is out... We have no one...

We really just need to not collapse again. I know that's really general and doesn't offer up anything but a complaint, but it's really one of out biggest problems. We wanted to be the ""bastards"" in the last 15 minutes, but it seems we've become the ""collapsers"" in those minutes instead.   Nando, needs good supply up top I think. He's good and get's really great runs and shots on goals, but is either denied by the GK, an offside flag, or a bad pass."

PhillyUnion,33qilh,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:20:51 2015 UTC,I know they can win it depends on their pace at this point they need to pressure hard like they did the first half of the last match. I dont know how they will function with the players missing but I think they need this win especially if Curtain wants to stick around and I hope he does. Im thinking we will see blake in goal and edu up in the midfield if Nogs cant play. We have the makings of a quality team its time to show it.
PhillyUnion,33qilh,jpoRS,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying this is a good idea, just that it's an interesting thought -  Blake; Williams, White, Vitoria, Gaddis; Lahoud, Edu, Carroll; Ayuk, Aristeguieta, Sapong. I don't believe we've ever played a 4-3-3, but what the hell.   Obviously White back at CB is not ideal, but I think moving Edu forward will help offset the DM hole we find ourselves in. And Carroll will be playing further back then we probably want him, so maybe he can do something useful like backing up the back line.   Most interesting is the three up front. There are a lot of reasons to be excited about these guys, and the Crew can't score if they just keep the ball in the back of the net.   Edit:?!"
PhillyUnion,33qilh,akuller,3,Sat Apr 25 01:22:09 2015 UTC,Maidana is close to 100% and should probably start.
PhillyUnion,33qilh,jpoRS,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:24:35 2015 UTC,"Probably, but that isn't as fun of a thought experiment, since he probably leads to a 4-2-3-1 again. Though I would like to see a 4-4-1-1 again."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,jpoRS,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"I like it, my only worry is white back there paired with the young keeper"

Were Nog or Pfeffer (or both) available, it would be a very compelling lineup to put them in and move Edu back to CB."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,jpoRS,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:51:25 2015 UTC,If Ayuk doesnt start I will lose some faith in Curtain... He has played so well I dont see a reason for him to sit unless he is hurt. I like that front three though.
PhillyUnion,33qilh,spqr-king,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"If Chaco or Aristeguieta aren't 90 minutes fit, I could understand having Ayuk on the bench. Assuming that he is actually used as a sub, and not passed over."
PhillyUnion,33qilh,jpoRS,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:53:02 2015 UTC,I think he is honestly to valuable if he is in the same form he was last time we saw him. He really put the defense on the spot which is something we need and something Wenger wasn't doing. I think our depth is killing us.

PhillyUnion,33jkpb,beggarb,9,Thu Apr 23 01:07:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far. Hackworth had a system, yes, and some parts of it even worked. We possessed the ball very well, but he was routinely out-coached on gameday. Let's not forget his tactical inflexibility, vanilla like-for-like subs of the same three players, and penchant for playing favorites over better options on the roster, not to mention routinely moving players out of position.   I guess what's so depressing about the whole thing is that Hackworth did have a plan and a goal even if he didn't really know how to implement or manage it. Curtin doesn't seem to have a plan at all."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,EdBacon,6,Thu Apr 23 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree about curtain. I think we look much better under curtin than hack playing wise. Curtin has had to deal with a bunch of factors this season: a lot of injuries, red card, etc.  The first few games we looked good and got screwed over by bad calls.  The union don't look bad per se, but they can't hold onto a lead.  If they can get this kink out I think we have a solid team.  I'm not saying I blindly trust curtin. But I'd like for him to have the rest of the season unless we get a proven coach (not likely)"
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,midwesternhousewives,5,Thu Apr 23 02:37:35 2015 UTC,"Unorganized defensively and consistently conceding 60% + possession? That doesn't look like good play to me. In the final 20+ minutes we're now dealing with the opposing team sitting entirely in our end. You can't watch these games and tell me they're not starting to look one-sided. I could understand if we were a ""counter-attacking"" team, but we're not. That's Curtin's way to excuse a complete inability to maintain possession and score through the run of play. Maybe we were, for a couple months last year when we could still hold onto the ball and other team's hadn't caught on yet, but now the secret is out. The Union are easy to play against.   I don't want to lay the blame at Curtin's feet, because its not his fault he was put into a position to fail, but he has shown no indication of being able to organize and coach a team into playing any style of soccer that will win us games. Like I said, it looks like there is zero plan out there besides ""kick the ball downfield"" for long stretches. This is 100% on the coach. It's his job to tell every player his role, make them understand their responsibilities on the field during defense and offensive plays, and then have them practice the skills they'll need to fill that role over. and over. and over again. The repeated breakdown of the defense is the fault of the coaching staff. I know ultimately its the ownership and FO that puts the technical staff there, so until that changes then nothing else changes.   Give Curtin more time or fire him and promote Albright. It doesn't make much difference at this point until the franchise is cleaned out from the top down. But we're by no means one or two tweaks away from Curtin having a competitive side."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,EdBacon,7,Thu Apr 23 02:52:07 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, another cycle of fire the coach, promote the technical director.  How about we not? Curtin led us to the USOC final after a terrible start to the 2014 season. Curtin's been pretty damn solid with his decisions, and a lot of people are putting a lot of weight on a guy after his team just played 3 times in 8 days.  And here I thought I was overreacting, but the hyperbole here is astounding. What will Albright do that is better than Curtin? Nothing."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,xenoletum,0,Thu Apr 23 04:04:47 2015 UTC,Are you reading a different comment? Where do I ask for Albright? I said it doesn't make any difference at this point. Curtin was not ready for this job and many of the team's failures up to this point are the responsibility of the coach and technical staff. But its the consistent inability of the FO to make successful personnel decisions in regards to the coach and technical staff that is the real problem.

The point is that, while Curtin may not be the most desirable choice as coach, removing him wouldn't even solve most of the problems. I'm really surprised given the context people are misconstruing that statement. Please read the whole thing. I literally say right after that Albright would be no better, and while I am not really pleased with Curtin as a coach, I don't expect any other change than another assistant being promoted were he to leave, highlighting the root of the problem: the FO.

PhillyUnion,33jkpb,Roslynsoccerfan,2,Thu Apr 23 09:48:51 2015 UTC,"I hated Hackworth more than anybody else, but to say that Curtin is not as bad is ridiculous. what is your basis for the statement?"
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,FlapjackJackson,3,Thu Apr 23 12:40:46 2015 UTC,See my comment above. Curtin is very rough around the edges whereas Hackworth wasn't cut out to be a manager.
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,EdBacon,2,Thu Apr 23 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Curtin has gotten some really basic stuff right, but is nowhere near being a quality coach. My concern is that he doesn't seem to have progressed since he was promoted. The play has looked significantly uglier and less effective than it did last year and that's a big problem."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,FlapjackJackson,5,Thu Apr 23 14:25:26 2015 UTC,"All that is true. However, I still don't think he is making the big fuck ups that Hackworth did. Plus, Curtin's has not had access to his best starting eleven since the first half of the opening game. It's not an excuse, but it is an observation."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,thelostdolphin,3,Thu Apr 23 14:31:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard to get an accurate read on him due to the massive amounts of injuries all happening at the same time, at the beginning of a season where things are weird and shaky anyway, during goalie drama, during a series of brutally bad ref decisions, and with a couple guys not showing anywhere close to the form they showed last season and even just this past Feb and March in Florida.   It's the coach's job to work through adversity, so I guess if you feel like, given the cards dealt to Curtin over the past month and half, another available manager desirous of the position of coaching our team could have done significantly better with the same hand, then you should want to see him gone.   For me, what he did with a largely healthy, but lower quality squad last year after a half season worth of losing and a dejected team/fan base suggests with a largely healthy, but higher quality squad (Fernando, Sapong, Vitoria) and significantly more time to turn things around, there is reason still to be hopeful."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:01:25 2015 UTC,I wrote it. Please tell me why this era is better. The football is uglier and the results are worse. Of course Hacktics were terrible but the point is that was a better time for the Union. So why is now better?
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,drewuke,6,Thu Apr 23 12:18:59 2015 UTC,"Curtin doesn't make the same stupid, stupid mistakes of Hackworth. Plus, Hackworth had a more or less healthy team most of his time. Curtin is dealing with more injuries and suspensions in his short tenure than Hackworth did for most of his. I am not excusing the poor results or sticking up for Curtin. I am just pointing out how ridiculous this article is.  Here are a long list of my issues with Hack:   He played Keon fucking Daniel as a CAM over Kleberson and Roger Torres. Curtin keeps his natural CAM's in as CAM. He played Wheeler as a CB. He refused to play Amobi as a DM and pissed him off. He sat young players in the shrimp deck rather than giving them a chance. Say what you will about Curtin, but he is doing a hell of a better job developing Pfeffer than Curtin ever did. Plus, he plays Ayuk. Do you really think Hackworth would have actually given Ayuk any minutes this year? Hackworth's subs were worse than Curtin's. Do you want to go back to the days of Hoppenot in the 65th minute every single game? At least some of Curtin's subs have made a positive impact (though his subs against the Revolution sucked). Hackworth constantly lied to and belittled fans. He said Okai was ""the most MLS-ready player in the draft"" and ""the best passer in the draft."" The fact that we needed a left back was ""laughable."" You don't pull that shit in Philly. All of Curtin's criticisms aside, he is at least a straight-shooter with respect for the fans. Hackworth alienated a shit ton of players. Look at how he handled the Adu, Soumare, Torres, and Kleberson situations. Did he really go about that the right way? Tiki-Hacka was just as ugly to watch as this. Just because possession was higher doesn't mean we were a better team. Most of our possession came through pointless backwards and sideways passes. It was mind-numbing to watch. Hackworth called Maidana a bad parent which is just unprofessional. He also sat him for these pointless reasons.   Like seriously, this is the most rose-tinted glasses I have ever seen. Curtin certainly has his issues due to being a young manager. Hackworth was never cut out to be a professional manager.  If you want to long for anyone, it should be Nowak. He was a shitty human being, but he is the only manager to have anything resembling tactics or a plan for this team."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,kav138,2,Thu Apr 23 14:04:12 2015 UTC,Remember when we lost 5-1 in New England and Hack blamed the ref for the loss?
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:16:32 2015 UTC,I think we can all agree that both are equally bad; they just excelled in different areas of badness:)
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,TriflingHotDogVendor,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:51:26 2015 UTC,"So there are examples of the same things with Curtin to be fair, with the exception of the Wheeler experiment. Curtin has been much better about finding the right position for people (perhaps with the exception of Ribeiro)....so He got rid of Keon for the year that was ""his"" You are right on Wheeler. Absolute insanity. Given where Pfeffer is now I'm not sure I would have played him a full year ago, especially given the investment made in the midfield. Does Curtin take chances on younger players? It seems so, but that doesn't make him a better coach. Amobi is where you are wrong. Curtin did not want him and sent the message in the Open Cup Final. You can't deny this, Curtin let him go. Hackworth's subs are worse than Curtin's, yes. But Curtin's aren't great. Curtin is a straight shooter. I think Hack was more of a puppet and not so much a liar as a mouthpiece. Curtin seems to have rejected that role which I respect greatly.   I'm not sure you got the point of the article. Sure, it's a little sensational. I am not extoling the virtues of Hack by any means. It was a woeful time. I am just pointing that where we sit isn't any better and the results back it up. Maybe you are right. Maybe things will get better from here and Curtin is the guy. There's just not enough evidence for me."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,hoax021,2,Thu Apr 23 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, you are talking to the guy who started the Fire Hackworth bandwagon on Big Soccer. I really, really do not like Hack.  Ribeiro was a symptom of the fact that Hack n' Sak left him with no strikers other than Casey. We needed someone there.  Pfeffer should have been brought along as a sub a long time ago. Look at someone like a Luis Gil, Andy Najar, or Diego Fagundez who was signed young and developed through small sub appearances. Pfeffer would be further along in his development if Hack had provided him actual minutes rather than forcing him to ride the bench and eat shrimp in the clubhouse.  Developing youth expands depth and the roster. Like I said, Hackworth would have sat Ayuk or sent him to Harrisburg. Curtin played him, and now he is the most dangerous winger on the team. Again, this gives us more flexibility which we would not have had if we did not blood youth.  It's not as if Amobi decided to leave due to the Open Cup Final. Hackworth failed to offer him an extension as well. Further, Amobi clearly did not want to be a CB. Being forced to play there consistently had an obvious impact on his willingness to stay. This isn't just on the F.O. and coaches. Amobi didn't want to be here. I can't blame him.  In a longer period of time, Hackworth's subs have never approved. Less than a year into his tenure, Curtin has already done a better job tactically even if it is not a particularly good or great job. We have seen more growth from him than we ever did from Hack.  No, I get the point. It's just ridiculous to idealize and romanticize a man who should never have been an MLS manager and failed in nearly everything he did and tried. If anything, Nowak should be the one being idealized.  I am not saying Curtin is the answer. Maybe he is rightfully fired in a month. However, I still think Curtin has done a much better job than Hackworth ever did, especially considering the fact that Curtin has only had access to his best eleven players for one half of a game this year. Some of the issues may be solved once everyone is back and healthy. Some may not. Again, I am still more impressed by Curtin than I ever was by Hack. I don't think we should be looking at Hack as a model of what we should be doing."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,drewuke,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:42:10 2015 UTC,"It's very possible that Amobi was long gone and Curtin had no say, but it's debated whether or not the Union even offered him a legit deal, which is crazy IMO. He might be a poor man's Edu but he would have been MUCH cheaper, a fan favorite, and the Union could have spent the money elsewhere and I think more productively. It's possible that Amobi was just an FO screw up.   You know my deal at this point. I think your arguments are fair. Curtin may ultimately get it done. I hope he does. I still struggle with the style of play and how far it can take us. It seems like teams can gameplan this counterattack effectively. Once you get good at possession based soccer it's hard for other teams to throw that off. I'd rather the Union push for that style than the one we have which I think is ultimately limited."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,xenoletum,5,Thu Apr 23 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"I actually have optimism.  But where do I even start?  Curtin got the Union to the most respectable spot they have ever been in with the Open Cup final, so that alone puts him ahead of Hackworth, IMO.  But beyond that, the soccer quality is still unknown right now, to be honest.  His offseason signings were brilliant (Ayuk, Fernando, and Vitoria!), but the 400-lbs and $500,000 gorilla in the room named Rais has put a serious weight around his ankles.  Keep in mind that Curtin hasn't played his real starting XI once this year.  When Chaco and Noguiera actually take the field TOGETHER, then we will start to see something good.  Those two with Ayuk on the wing and Aristeguieta up front - I'm telling you right now, they will score goals.  The defense is solid with Vitoria and Edu in the middle, IMO.  Gaddis and Williams are still settling in, but I'm pretty confident that they will excel as the season rolls on.  Especially Gaddis.  Lahoud has stepped up, but I question him as a long term solution.  When this summer transfer window opens, they will hopefully use the M'Bolhi money to sign William Kvist being that his team is in line towards being relegated.  If not, they have a ton of money to spend on the open market.  I know that the typical psycho Philly sports fan is going into lemming mode right now, but once the injury report gets better, there is a solid team there.  I'm pretty patient.  I still want to see where Curtin can take this.  I especially find it tough criticize Curtin given the shit hand he's been dealt.  I never got that feeling with Hackworth.   But, come on, Hackworth?  The dude was nuts. (Thankfully not Nowak nuts.) He tried to convert Aaron Wheeler into an effing CB.  Name me one thing Curtin has done that bizarre and disastrous.  It was incompetence on a fascinating level.  At least Curtin knows the team's deficiencies.  Granted, he still hasn't fixed the late game lapses, but he isn't in lala land pretending that everything is going to be okay as long as he starts the players that try the hardest in practice under the on field leadership of Brian Carroll.        But the #1 reason right now is a time to be more optimistic?  We are finally coming out of the Nick Sak as helicopter GM of the Philadelphia Union era.  He had his hand slapped by Sugarman and was demoted to a business-only role.  And that's the one thing about Jim I like the most. He is at least strong enough of a person to take the reigns from Sakiewicz, bench his boy (hell, send him back to Europe,) and put his foot down on his roster.    Granted, they are still feeling the lingering effects of Nick's influence with Nick's boy sitting on his ass in France while collecting a huge paycheck; but, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I couldn't see that with Hack in charge as Nick's yes man.  Jim has shown a record of making good signings and, it appears, he won't have his plans all screwed up by Nick."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I believe all these are fair points. Curtin at the least seems more level headed which should be worth something eventually. I still don't see a ""purpose"" in what Curtin is building. As someone wrote somewhere else, it feels like the Sixers between AI and Hinkie, just plodding along without a direction. I worry that is happening and it's not just a function of injuries. If that's the case then the Union can afford some depth."
PhillyUnion,33jkpb,Mike81890,2,Thu Apr 23 17:37:50 2015 UTC,Do I want Hackworth back? Hell no. Do I want Curtin as our manager? Hell no. Do I want an experienced manager? Hell yes.

PhillyUnion,33es5q,EdBacon,2,Tue Apr 21 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a bit of everyone's fault. From some of the players on the field to Curtin's failed subs and tactics. But there really is one problem that needs to be fixed  It's Sak. Of course it's Sak. Everyone knows it's Sak. The problem is what can we do?  Signs criticizing and demanding a change in the FO are taken away from us (and frankly I'm surprised that guy's shirt from the other day wasn't taken away as well.) I don't know how we as fans and supporters of this club can express our anger and frustration and want of change if every time we do it our voices are taken away.   Sak makes bad decisions of what players we purchase and sign and as much as I like Curtin, I don't know if he was/is ready for the job he now has, but I want to give him more time before I fully decide on that.  Sak is consistently the answer to this question of ""Who do we blame?"" and it's not unwarranted."
PhillyUnion,33es5q,Too_many_hippos,5,Wed Apr 22 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think the ownership group was ever really concerned with the soccer team. If we want to move them on then we need to act through the only manner that they'll understand, and that's one that will impact them financially. It might be time to start boycotting games and merchandise. If you believe the rumors then the word is that the team is barely treading water as is, so maybe pressure there will cause them to rethink their plans. Bearfight Brigade already started their blackout, so maybe the rest of the fans should step up and take it a step further. I don't count on the SoB to do squat anymore.

PhillyUnion,33enpm,flyersunion28,6,Tue Apr 21 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"Priority number one has to be a real LB. It's a position that's been neglected to the point where it just goes beyond reason. We haven't had a true LB since Jordan Harvey... think about that for a minute, and then remember we spent millions of dollars on the likes of Freddy Adu, Lionard Pajoy, Juan Diego Gonzalez, and Rais M'Bolhi. Then we have to think about signing legitimate, starting quality wingers, and possibly another CDM to pair with Nogs. I'm ok with having Pfeffer, Ayuk, Lahoud, and Le Toux as depth at that point.   edit: Oh, and ideally a change of ownership. That's what I'd really like to see more than any player moves this summer."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,EdBacon,3,Tue Apr 21 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Lahoud is a servicable CDM at this point and with Edu as a last resort, I think we're ok with CDM.  LB is obviously priority #1, then I'd like to see at least 1 legitimate winger."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,xxtoejamfootballxx,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"I agree Lahoud has been adequate, but I'd be way more comfortable with a better starter and using Lahoud as depth. A bench of McCarthy, Lahoud, White, Le Toux, Ayuk, and Pfeffer would be pretty decent."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,EdBacon,2,Wed Apr 22 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"To me, winger is a far bigger need than LB. We can survive with Ray on the left. Our attack cannot survive with Wenger and Le Toux out wide. They are black holes right now where possession goes to die."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Really we have three or four very pressing needs: wingers, LB, and a CDM, in whatever order but I'd be happy with an improvement to any of them right now. And then depth."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,EdBacon,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"So new at this, had to look up Jordan Harvey. It's a shame the position has been overlooked ever since. Hopefully they get it right this time and prove to the fans they mean to be a contender"
PhillyUnion,33enpm,spqr-king,5,Wed Apr 22 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe because I'm a new fan of the union, I'm not as doom and gloom as some of the rest but I feel like we are really close to being a top 10 tier club. We have some obvious weak spots and imo could use either a LW or a CB, maybe more so the latter. With a legitimate first-team CB, we would have good depth at the CB position with White and Edu a possible CB too. Plus this would also provide us with more depth at DM with Edu back in the spot he wants and Lahoud playing decently. Along with this, what do some of you think the possibility we see more of our young guys like Catic or Mclaughlin? I think with a little added depth from our young guys, not just Pfeffer and Ayuk, we could really look like a good full 90-minute team."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,goatyhead,8,Tue Apr 21 22:26:31 2015 UTC,I honestly think Edu is a better CB and should stay there despite his distaste for it. Also with Fernando and Sapong I think its premature to bring in Catic or Mclaughlin. Keep loaning them out to get that experience and then when they are ready and mature move them up.
PhillyUnion,33enpm,xxtoejamfootballxx,3,Wed Apr 22 01:02:26 2015 UTC,"my 2c, starting from your points.  Edu needs to suck it up and realize he's much better suited as a CB for this team. Nogueira and he play too similar when they are both in midfield, and I don't think that works very well. However at CB he's a legitimate all star candidate.  Our wing situation is much worse than our LB situation at this point. Wenger not only has not regained last seasons form, he's noticeably regressing. This is disastrous for a team this thin on quality out wide. LeToux gonna LeToux, I expect no more and no less but the fact that he can't read anything off of Fernando is getting really obnoxious. He's still playing an MLS 2.0 game, that's not going to cut it anymore.  My likes would be a solid ball winning DM to play the yin to Noguiera's yang and at least one wing that can make it work with Fernando."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,goatyhead,2,Wed Apr 22 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating how much depth matters.  Injurries happen, people get tired, you play 4 games in 10 days with the USOC, etc.  We don't even have starting wingers, let alone depth at that position, which is one of the most important in a 4-2-3-1.  Not to mention we haven't had a left back in years.  With so much constant turn-over, we'll never be able to get the chemistry to make a run we'd need to make noise in the playoffs.  I'd say we're 4 signings or so away from being a top 10 team, which is a lot for a poor team in a capped league."
PhillyUnion,33enpm,gaparmer,2,Wed Apr 22 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm starting to understand from everyone's post that LB has really been neglected. When it came to wingers, I suppose I was kinda thinking that Ayuk looks pretty good out there and Wenger could return to last years form and with Le Toux as a sub, I didn't think that sounded all that bad. Though I don't disagree we could use some more depth at the winger position"
PhillyUnion,33enpm,EdBacon,2,Wed Apr 22 17:15:16 2015 UTC,Ayuk looks pretty good so far but remember no one in this league has seen much of him. Once that changes we'll see how much he really has to offer (cf. Wenger for the possible precipitous drop in quality once teams figure you out)  If all we want on the left side is solid D I think Gaddis can work. As long as he can work out his problems with positioning. Being faster than the other guy as your backup plan only works for so long.

PhillyUnion,33bbmc,EdBacon,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:11:15 2015 UTC,I remember hearing somewhere (KYW?) that the Union may be able to get out of the contract if its a mutual separation. Which isn't unbelievable since Raïs clearly doesn't want to be here.
PhillyUnion,338ygy,midwesternhousewives,7,Mon Apr 20 16:27:42 2015 UTC,Gaddis has had a spectacular season thus far and gets shit on for one bad game... I dont quite get how this will help the team as the real turning point was the subs who slowed down our game and allowed them to score. We need a better bench and to not let up when things are working. Put in Ayuk rather than Wenger and you have a totally different match.
PhillyUnion,338ygy,spqr-king,3,Mon Apr 20 18:52:51 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  I definitely wouldn't blame Gaddis for this game, even if he and Curtin do so.  You have a guy who's played 3 full games in the past week, and is constantly pressured.  Instead of continuing pressuring NE some, it's decided to ""park the bus"".  Bad move."
PhillyUnion,338ygy,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:03:29 2015 UTC,Agreed parking the bus when we had the momentum was an awful decision but its the first truly awful decision Curtin has made in my opinion.
PhillyUnion,338ygy,cmills1,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. Everyone's giving Curtin a lot of heat for this loss, but while the subs were a bad move, there also weren't a lot of options. We've got zero depth on a good day, and this was the third game in 9 days, with lots of guys banged around/coming back from injury, against a good team. So, yes, maybe not the best decision, but the deck was stacked against us big time here. Let's not call for the guy's head just yet."
PhillyUnion,338ygy,Dean_Moriarty,4,Tue Apr 21 14:07:27 2015 UTC,"Also this quote by Curtin:  “Brian Carroll had nothing to do with the goal,” Curtin said. “Ray [Gaddis] gets beat 1-on-1 in a spot where he never gets beat 1-on-1, and today he did. So to put that on [Carroll] is ridiculous. If you want to put it on me, that’s fine. But at the same time, I knew going into the game, I was subbing those two guys around the 60-minute mark with the thought [that we were playing] three games in nine days.”"
PhillyUnion,338ygy,thelostdolphin,9,Mon Apr 20 16:28:43 2015 UTC,Bizarre reasoning there.  It's good to have a plan going in but you gotta be flexible to adjust with the game.  We were getting overrun and dominated in the second half.  We needed to get some posession going to relieve the pressure.    Taking off Maidana in favor of Carroll is the opposite of what was needed.  And putting on a terribly out of form Wenger for Sapong who was having a good game is bizarre as well.   And how Le Toux remains automatically written in for 90 minutes every game is beyond me.
PhillyUnion,338ygy,Dean_Moriarty,4,Mon Apr 20 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to realize that neither Sapong nor Maidana are 100% healthy. They are 60, maybe 70 minutes healthy at most, so their subbing offs were inevitable from the moment Curtin set the lineup. The issue is he blew his full offensive load in the first 45 mins in hopes of putting up enough goals to survive the inevitably more defensive second halves (given our options off the bench). That gamble didn't pay off and the amount of rhythm we gave NE in the second half lead to our back line making errors they didn't make in the first and wouldn't have made in the second if we still were playing higher up and with a more attacking mindset.  I think White should've come on and taken over at CB (as questionable as I think his play can be) around that 60th minute when Sapong and Maidana had to come out and Edu should've moved up with Pfeffer coming in too.  I also think we should've used Ayuk in some capacity. He plays zero defense, so I get why he didn't come on with the strategy Jim went with in the second half, but I think he could've been used for at least half the game and that also would've contributed to a more balanced approach to both halves."
PhillyUnion,338ygy,thelostdolphin,2,Mon Apr 20 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah all good points.  The double-sub and essentially doubling down on the defensive strategy that was not working by taking off Maidana and putting on Carroll really bit us though.    We don't have the quality of defense to really bunker for an entire half. I just think it was the wrong idea to do that in the first place, and that double sub doubly hurt it us because it took the team further in the wrong direction and limited our choices once we needed to score.  And partialy related, when are we going to see McLaughlin? I know he was unavailable last night but that's only because Curtin decided he wasn't going to play him so loaned him to HCI for a game."
PhillyUnion,338ygy,kav138,3,Mon Apr 20 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. There's no reason to have these two vastly different approaches in the first and second halves. We're neither a big enough offensive machine, nor a ""park the bus"" solid enough defensive team to go with that strategy. But I think we actually look pretty good when we're distributing the responsibility across all 11 players. I really feel bad for Gaddis, Williams, and Lahoud for their giveaways and mental lapses. In the first half, they did well to put a stop to whatever rhythm NE tried to create, but that's because they were needed in short bursts, did their jobs, and then got a breather to collect themselves as the midfielders and forwards held possession and went for the attack. But when they're asked to do that nonstop for 45 minutes and with the quality of attacking getting better and better as time goes on, it's just inevitable that something is going to break down.   I'd definitely like to see McLaughlin, especially with our offensive options limited by both injury and poor form. It just seems like every iteration of the coaching staff over the past couple years doesn't seem very confident in him. You've got an 18 year old Ayuk getting starting minutes and a 21 year old with more experience and some first team minutes already under his belt not being used. I don't know what to think of that. I'm also curious to see what Catic can do, but he may need more time coming from lower tier college play up to MLS."
PhillyUnion,338ygy,GoldBlooded10,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why McLaughlin has not seen the field, especially considering the play of wengner and letoux"
PhillyUnion,338ygy,FlapjackJackson,5,Tue Apr 21 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. I do understand they weren't 100% healthy yet and doesn't want to risk injuring them (especially coming off a 3 game week where people are tired), but this just shows how inflexible this particular move was.  I still think Curtin deserves the season and am not calling for his head yet, but I think Union should have still been pushing forward some, historically we've never been good at parking the bus.  Of course, hindsight is 20/20 and if Ayuk came out we may be saying ""why the hell didn't we go with a more defensive minded player when we were up a goal 1-0?""    Overall, the union looked gassed coming out in the 2nd half, I think the 3 games this week just paid it's toll.  Hopefully they can turn this season around.  They dug themselves a nice little hole, but it's not impossible yet, the East looks week.  My biggest concern is how many more games we've played than anyone else and look shitty in the ranking, that's going to be a tough gap to close."
PhillyUnion,338ygy,bmangan,2,Mon Apr 20 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"If you knew you were taking Maidana out after 60 minutes then you should have kept Pfeffer on the bench to have someone play the midfield, especially after the way Pfeffer played as a sub the game before. Ayuk should have come off the bench before Wenger and I just can't think of any good reason why Brian Carroll should ever be on the field. How he is still on the team, let alone was our captain for a season, is beyond me. That's my two cents."

PhillyUnion,336mc8,Timothy-H,10,Mon Apr 20 01:01:21 2015 UTC,I personally dont think wenger has the speed or the footwork to be a LB in this league
PhillyUnion,336mc8,bterre108,3,Mon Apr 20 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"no... our track record with switching players from forwards to defensive is terrible, there is no way that Gaddis/Wenger will turn out better than Gaddis/Williams"
PhillyUnion,336mc8,oooooooounbelievable,5,Mon Apr 20 12:56:35 2015 UTC,I don't think the answer to left back is on the roster.  We would be such a better team if we could sign a quality CDM and a good left footed LB.  I've been fine with Lahoud this year which has surprised me. So maybe LB is priority 1 and CDM is 1A.
PhillyUnion,336mc8,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"We need real wingers too. Right now we're playing Wenger and Le Toux and the result has been tragic. Ayuk I feel is a better bench option for now, although maybe you can start Sapong in that role. You'd still need one good option out wide, preferably left footed."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 20 02:43:44 2015 UTC,Isn't being played as a winner exactly why Sapong didn't thrive in KC?
PhillyUnion,336mc8,jpoRS,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, its not ideal, but otherwise who else plays on the wing? We have nobody who naturally plays that position. I guess you'd want to look for both wingers.   Really, if you look at the starting XI there's maybe seven players I'd continue to start: Blake, Edu, Vittoria, Gaddis, Nogueira, Maidana, and Aristegiueta. You'd need to pick up a LB, right and left wingers, and another CDM to have a real starting lineup. This team is spread ridiculously thin even with everyone healthy."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 20 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to be forgetting that Wenger started to look really good towards the end of last season. If he can get back to that level, he can be a dangerous winger."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,CouldBeBetterForever,3,Mon Apr 20 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Wenger. He looked great last year, and his preseason form looked like he was poised for a breakout year.  But he's had a really bad season so far.  I'm not giving up on him, but until he can prove he's back on track we should be trying other options there."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,Dean_Moriarty,5,Mon Apr 20 16:41:52 2015 UTC,Let Ayuk take over for Wenger and have him drop to LB... Could it really hurt to try at this point?
PhillyUnion,336mc8,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:43:12 2015 UTC,I think we missed the boat on Marcel de Jong.

PhillyUnion,336mc8,ignoramis,3,Mon Apr 20 03:45:54 2015 UTC,"Except Gaddis is to left foot as Justin Mapp is to right foot.  Shea is a threat going forward on the left side, Gaddis definitely is not."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:43:17 2015 UTC,With all the money we've spent on keepers you think we would have made room for a left back.

PhillyUnion,336mc8,drewuke,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:13:29 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this during the game. Putting Wenger at LB, and having gaddis and Williams duke it out for LB spot. This was a small sample size but sapong looked good out there and has that striking instinct that Wenger seems to lack (from what I've seen, I'm new at this soccer thing)."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,flyersunion28,2,Mon Apr 20 01:17:27 2015 UTC,"I think Curtin is reluctant to give up on Wenger offensively because he was on fire the second half of the last season. He's got the potential to be that guy again, but for whatever reason, has been invisible in the first month and a half of this season."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it has to do with Maidana.  Wenger and Maidana haven't been playing together much this season.  Last season Wenger wasn't good until Maidana started getting regular minutes.  Could be a coincidence, but considering how much better the rest of the team plays with Maidana out there, I don't think it is."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,empossible,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but much of what offense Andrew provided last year was off of turnovers and then using his speed to either score or provide service in the box to someone like Le Toux or Casey. This year, the issue for me is how little effort Wenger is putting into trying to involve himself in some way in the offense. He's been very passive and sits back a lot, waiting for something to come to him."
PhillyUnion,336mc8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:29:09 2015 UTC,"Wenger was a CB at Duke and nearly won the Hermann so yes it reasonable to think he could play defense. I think he could be serviceable at LB. Also, after today's performance and countless others like it over the years I think it's time to stop referring to Williams as a good right back"
PhillyUnion,3368m9,drewuke,23,Sun Apr 19 22:59:08 2015 UTC,Sheanon Williams is terrible. The only player worse than him is Andrew Wenger.  Curtin cost us the match. He picked a good starting lineup and then gave up on it. Why sit back the entire second half.  What the fuck does Andrew Wenger do better than Ayuk? How do you take off all your creative players?
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,6,Sun Apr 19 23:02:33 2015 UTC,Wiliams has progressively gotten worse since 2012. Not the same player. I don't think he's as hungry. Too many mental lapses.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,cjd5286,9,Sun Apr 19 23:12:47 2015 UTC,"He's been on a losing side for his entire MLS career now. This kind of stuff is becoming engrained in too many of our players. Have a shit game? Poor play cost us a result? It's nothing to write home about anymore, especially with so much blame to go around. Nobody progresses and there are never consequences. The Union is becoming a team with a clear losing culture."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,3,Sun Apr 19 23:14:58 2015 UTC,The Union have a clear and established losing culture already.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 20 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"It's more obvious this year. From the get go I don't think there was much confidence, at least far less than I've seen in any previous season. The consensus this year has pretty much been that the season will be a wash even before the first match."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:14:08 2015 UTC,Nah. Too much Candy for the Candyman.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thelostdolphin,3,Sun Apr 19 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"Curtin didn't give up on our starting lineup. He just used too many of our offensive options from the get go in hopes of putting up enough goals to survive an onslaught of pressure in the second half.  Maidana and Sapong are maybe at 70-75% capacity still, coming off injuries, so they were inevitable subs that needed to be made when they were made and the bench options we have to replace them were largely defensive-minded players.   The reason Wenger was chosen over Ayuk is because Ayuk plays virtually 0 defense (I like him and think that will improve as he gets older and bigger physically, but that's how it is for now) and for the dismal offensive contribution Andrew has provided, he still can cover men waaay better. If Ayuk was match fit, he should've been used in the first half. I also think, as much as I don't place much stock in White, they should've put in him at CB and moved Edu up in that final third of the game.  I think Curtin's biggest mistake is this offensive one half/defensive second half strategy, which didn't work in KC and didn't work yesterday. The sort of possession we allow in our first halves is not at all like the possession we allow in our second halves. In the first half, much of that possession was at midfield and NE was effectively closed down the deeper they got into our half, preventing them from getting into a rhythm and wearing out our back line in the process. The second half, they got into our back 1/3 of the field and stayed there, which inevitably leads to goals and makes our back line look worse than it really is. Gaddis, Williams, and Lahoud all had costly giveaways or mental errors in the second half and it's a direct result of that constant pressure. They all did well in the first half because they were needed in bursts and then could recompose themselves and recharge their batteries.   For as much as I liked the idea of Pfeffer and Maidana starting together, I think Pfeffer is better served (with the current state of the team) as the sub for Maidana, or vice versa and Ayuk, if available to play, should be used in the first half.   Also, Wenger's lack of offense is an enormous loss to us this first month and a half of the season. If he can wake up and start playing the way he did the second half of last season, I think we will have a lot of success, especially if that coincides with our squad getting close to 100% healthy. Fernando needs service to be effective. He's not going to out run or out dribble opponents. Wenger can be an important part of the offense in that regard.  I keep trying to remind myself of how dismal our first half of the last season was and how well we finished despite that. I think we would've made the playoffs if it weren't for the USOC. I'm glad we got to the finals. It was pretty cool, but I still feel strongly that that was the difference in the last month and a half of the season in terms of us getting into the playoffs. So we still have a lot of time to get rolling and the east is less competitive this season than last."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,2,Mon Apr 20 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with Ayuk. He had two big defensive stops against Villa in the two NYC games. He constantly fights to win the ball back in midfield and usually succeeds. I have been surprised at how good his defending is.  Also, I wouldn't bank on Wenger turning good anytime soon."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"Ayuk's quick and can make some nice tackles and get some interceptions, but he's not a big enough presence and doesn't have as high of a defensive positional IQ as other players. He's 18 and what he already does is positive and makes me excited for his future, but I just don't think he's the guy you bring in to close things down in the second half of a game, if that's the strategy you're going with (not saying I agree with that strategy).   Do you think the Wenger we've seen over the last month and a half is the real Wenger and the one we saw for the second half of last season is the anomaly?"
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"Wenger is the guy to close down the game? He played a big part in the equalizer by ball watching and vacating the left flank. Ayuk at least tracks back.  It looks as though Wenger has regressed to his norm. He is a one trick pony that was found out. He doesn't have the creativity or soccer brain to adapt. He is the typical athletic American soccer player, and that is it."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think either of them are the answer defensively. I'm just saying that little 18 year old Ayuk wouldn't be my first choice.   As for what Wenger is or isn't, even his main trick (bombing up the side line and delivering service into the box) has been nonexistent. He's just not doing anything. It's not that he's being shut down defensively. He's just not getting involved. Le Toux is kind of a one trick pony too, but he's all over the place and trying to get involved constantly. Wenger is just sitting back and being passive. So I'm hesitant to conclude that his poor performances this season are a result of him being found out or his lack of creativity and more of a lack of either confidence, fitness, mindset, or some other intangible thing that has very little to do with his ability."

PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,3,Sun Apr 19 23:26:00 2015 UTC,They had a ton of good chances and looked more dangerous in the first half
PhillyUnion,3368m9,AGM720,11,Sun Apr 19 23:40:47 2015 UTC,I feel like Curtin has to take the blame for this one. He changed a winning formula by bringing on Carroll and Wenger and parking the bus for essentially the entire second half. To take off the players who were doing almost everything for you offensively with 30 minutes to play is idiotic. The fact that we decided to park the bus with 30+ min left makes no sense.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, both players were coming back from injury and likely aren't fully fit."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,Too_many_hippos,10,Mon Apr 20 11:27:25 2015 UTC,"Bad subs. Don't know why Ayuk didn't get any time, his speed against tired legs would have opened up the defence I think.  I also would have kept Sapong in. Maybe he was taken off because they were worried about his injury, but he was looking good out there, his chances would have succeeded eventually. Would have liked to see Chaco stay in as well.   Also I just feel plain bad for Nando. He never stops, puts in a lot of effort, and it just seems that no one can supply him adequately and consistently.   Whatever. This is Philly after all, this is what we do.   EDIT: To be fair though we got a little unlucky and they had some great defensive blocks. Nando's missed goal off the crossbar was just a fraction away from a goal and those two goal line blocks of theirs were fantastic."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thelostdolphin,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"Chaco and Sapong aren't health enough yet, coming off injuries, to play 90 mins.   The reason Ayuk didn't come on was because he plays zero defense and Jim's plan (ultimately the wrong one) was to go with a defensive strategy in the second half, absorb the blows from our opponent, and hopefully hang on long enough to win with 1 goal. When that didn't happen, Curtin used his last sub to bring on Casey in the hopes of adding some last minute offense to at least salvage a draw.   This is the same pattern of the SKC game.   What's frustrating is, we already concede enough possession in the way we play so I don't understand why we have to double down in that direction in the second halves of games, especially only up 1-0. We allow our opponents to get into way too good of rhythms. The first half we conceded possession, but it's a lot of non-threatening midfield possession that isn't taxing on our back line, so though the stats look one-sided, they are a bit misleading. The type we allowed in the second half was deep into your half, which is why it becomes only a matter of time before something gets into the net.   Curtin is in a tricky position though. Chaco and Sapong aren't yet able to play 90 mins and Wenger is completely invisible offensively, so aside from Ayuk, who concedes a lot to whomever he's faced with, and Casey, who is only healthy enough still to play 15-20 mins, almost all of our bench options lend themselves to a defensive approach. As much as I liked Pfeffer and Maidana starting together, I think Pfeffer would have been more useful as a second half sub and Jim should've started Ayuk and switched him out if he was collapsing too often defensively to make him worth keeping on the field."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,Too_many_hippos,0,Mon Apr 20 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good points. I kinda like your idea of a Pfeffer and Maidana switch. And I figured the Sapong and Maidana subs were made because of their health, just sucks that it had to happen. Or depth is crap right now, we need people to get back to full health stat.   I also think this game was Curtin's fault. His defensive strategy did not work for us and cost us the game."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,GoldBlooded10,9,Mon Apr 20 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"You take off the only creative player in Maidana and a workhorse in Sapong and put on Wenger and Brian fucking Carroll? And the you take off Pfeffer way later than you should have at the point of the game where he's the only one slightly capable of playing in the middle and you put on Casey? At that point it became a game of kickball. Our outside backs were either out of position or lazy following runners, especially Williams. How Ayuk didn't get on the field is beyond me. I could go on but I'm too disappointed."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,4-1-3-2,2,Sun Apr 19 23:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, and yes.   Taking off our best performing players up to that point, making a shitty attempt to shore-up with Carroll and Wenger, and then throwing on Casey ""Plan B"" Connor when you realise it was all a mistake."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,cmills1,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:29:01 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the lack of Ayuk (and, probably, the subbing off of Maidana and Sapong) was more of an injury/depth thing — Curtin isn't an idiot.   My thinking is that, perhaps, in the third game in 9 days, he didn't want to re-injure these guys or make it any worse. We literally just got Maidana back to health, and as everyone here probably agrees, we're a much better team with him on the field.  Ayuk is an exciting kid — but he's an 18 year old kid, and he hasn't played a full 90 all season. Based on what Curtin himself has said about him, it certainly isn't due to lack of performance.   It was a disappointing result, sure, but maybe we cut our losses and move on to next week, ideally with a healthy starting 11."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,dekelly,8,Tue Apr 21 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"Team came out in the second half looking to keep the 1-0 lead. TT said it multiple times on the broadcast, if you keep sitting back and let the Revs get a rhythm going, you're going to lose. And that's exactly what happened.   And I think you mean GOTW nominee. Did you see Higuain's backheel or either of Giovinco's goals? A lot of good ones this week."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thanksbastards,4,Sun Apr 19 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"I think Obafemi and the Sounders' ballot-stuffing will end up winning. Not discrediting whether he deserves it, but it's really no question considering how the PNW fans show up for those types of things."

PhillyUnion,3368m9,soccerman,13,Sun Apr 19 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"Chaco can't get back to fitness soon enough. What is Jay Sugarman doing in the compromising photos that Brian Carroll has of him? You know what? Mike Lahoud has his shit together. He isn't great, but he isn't a liability anymore. McCarthy finally made the mistake I've been waiting for. He can't expect to come out of goal every time and not have it bite him in the ass eventually. Hopefully he takes this as a learning experience and it doesn't rattle his cage too much. Did anyone else think it looked like Edu is finally adapting to his position at CB? Seriously what was the deal with the bridge side of the pitch? Lots of players slipping.   All told, New England is good. We are, at best, okay. We played well, but not well enough. Sigh."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,jpoRS,3,Sun Apr 19 23:15:30 2015 UTC,The second goal was huge part lahouds fault. He literally ran away from the player with the ball allowing him play an easy uncontested cross

PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:04:48 2015 UTC,I actually put most of the blame of that goal on Wenger.  There was a goal kick that literally dropped uncontested a few feet from him.  He just watched it hit the ground and bounce to a 50-50 ball that NE won.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,Too_many_hippos,3,Tue Apr 21 19:24:44 2015 UTC,Calling it now Blake in goal next match.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:24:00 2015 UTC,Is he healthy yet? I thought the only reason McCarthy is in is because Blake can't be played yet.

PhillyUnion,3368m9,WildGooseCarolinian,2,Mon Apr 20 18:48:54 2015 UTC,Thats true but if he is at say 80% now he will be ready for next weekend most likely. I think we will see him which isnt a bad thing because when he leaves for Gold Cup we will see McCarthy again.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:55:34 2015 UTC,"I think he's on the bench because he's the only backup we have with M'Bolhi enjoying his (over)paid vacation in France at the moment.  We can't have no goalies on the bench, and Blake at 75% is better than moving, I dunno, Lahoud back to goal."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,WildGooseCarolinian,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:23:01 2015 UTC,Yea but if he wasnt in any condition to play they wouldnt have let MBolhi leave period because we need someone in goal. I think Blake will be good to play this weekend but we will see. They will probably be more willing to chance it considering we can just throw McCarthy back in if Blake isnt at 100.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,jpoRS,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Blake should be back this week, but I do hunk curtinms assessment was probably that Johnny Mac at 100% was greater than Blake at 75%. Blake could have done in a pinch, but better not to push it.   Hopefully he'll be back soon. JMac isn't bad, and he hasn't been punished for his mistakes yet (all the goals so far have been the fault of the defense in my mind, though he certainly could have been punished), but I still think a healthy Blake is going to be better than a healthy McCarthy, assuming Blake actually is back at 100%"
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:12:30 2015 UTC,I believe Curtin when he says the decision is made based on who is performing best in practice. If you're right I think it's less an indictment of McCarthy and more a testament to Blake.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:37:11 2015 UTC,Yea McCarthy is just young people keep saying he is playing like a MBolhi on facebook like a statue and all I can think is MBolhi is around 8 years older than he is. While McCarthy is in his infancy as a goalie MBolhi was supposed to be nearing his prime. Blake has played well for us and I hope we keep McCarthy and give him time to grow but Blake should take the lead unless there is something in practice we are not seeing on the field.

PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,2,Sun Apr 19 23:11:51 2015 UTC,I feel this odd sense of deja' vu...
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,5,Sun Apr 19 23:32:32 2015 UTC,Wenger over Ayuk what world is this? Is he being punished for his amazing play the last few matches? Is he not 100%? Or are we just to stupid to see the same thing repeated wont work???
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,3,Sun Apr 19 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"Well, remember how we had ""Hackworth's guys""? No matter how badly you play, you get trotted out every week? This is the same thing but with a slightly different set of players."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,2,Sun Apr 19 23:33:39 2015 UTC,I feel like we have no other option. Who are we going to replace bad players with we have no depth?
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:37:56 2015 UTC,"Hell, at least Ayuk could have come on instead of Wenger. Even leaving the starting XI on the field and NOT using all our subs, or just using them to kill time in the last ten minutes would have been a better strategy. Swapping our three best attacking players (sans Nando) for Carroll, Wenger, and Casey, with that much time left to play? Crazy."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:46:35 2015 UTC,This I agree with but other than that...
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,2,Sun Apr 19 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"Leave them on the field and then use them to try and kill time in the final ten minutes. I understand Curtin has his hands tied by a piss poor FO who wants to replace top tier soccer with a Sunday kick-about and expect us to keep paying to watch it, but the dude did himself no favors with those tactics."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"I agree I just think this is the first tie we have seen him do that. Hopefully he learns from it and develops like McCarthy after todays loss. He is a young coach just like McCarthy is a young goalie I dont think either of them are bad just inexperienced and as they grow they will hopefully get better. I honestly feel like we are three pieces away from a championship team and hopefully we can pick those up in the transfer window because what we desperately need is depth. Not Carroll, Casey, Fabinho, Fred... We need young hungry players or solid experienced players with something left in the tank."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,3,Mon Apr 20 00:02:05 2015 UTC,"But he hasn't been learning, that's the issue. This isn't a new problem the team has faced. He has watched this play out repeatedly, and continued to make the same decisions.   This team's issues aren't going to be solved by adding one or two new pieces. The problems go a lot deeper than that. You can start with the overall tactical identity of the team: what style and system do you want to play, and how does everyone adapt that style to different situations? The team is disorganized and lacks ideas on the field. There's no clear plan on how to create chances through the run of play, unless you count hoof-ball a style of play.   More than that, I just don't see a concerted plan by this franchise as a whole. There's no real identity on the field, and there's no indication the FO wants to make the personnel changes and investment it would take to get there. And this isn't strictly a spending issue, its a leadership issue of how the team is organized."

PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,4,Mon Apr 20 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"I'm calling that a managerial defeat.  All of Heaps' subs were good; Curtain's were pretty much all bad.  I don't feel the personal were individually bad choices (or that they made game changing mistakes), but he went ahead and took off all of the creative players, and basically tried to win the game 1-0.  Chaco and Sapong did not look tired and were playing very well, so I don't know why they were replaced.  Then to take Pfeffer off as well, for Casey.  Ayuk should have been one of the subs, if Curtin wanted to remove those three."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,Tohaba,4,Sun Apr 19 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"Carroll, in any situation, is a bad decision at this point. Likewise with letting Wenger back on the pitch."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,Luzzi15,4,Sun Apr 19 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"Dumbest substitutions ever. We went into a defensive shell, and then brought on defensive substitutes and immediately gave up a goal.   Blowing leads as often as we do is a manager issue if you ask me."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlashKelly,6,Sun Apr 19 23:09:48 2015 UTC,Yo guys the Eagles signed Tebow ayy lmao
PhillyUnion,3368m9,atypicalclothespin,9,Sun Apr 19 23:02:39 2015 UTC,You think he can play LB?
PhillyUnion,3368m9,arkr,2,Sun Apr 19 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"I mean we tried to restart the careers of Vince Young, Michael Vick, and Mark Sanchez so why the fuck not give Tebow a shot? Logic"
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,3,Sun Apr 19 23:11:17 2015 UTC,Williams isn't the same player. He just turned off on the goals...
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thanksbastards,11,Sun Apr 19 23:00:39 2015 UTC,He's still the same player. He has been doing it for years.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlashKelly,2,Sun Apr 19 23:03:06 2015 UTC,"You mean Edu, right? He totally played Davies onside when the rest of the D was playing a higher line. Williams was actually tracking close on the second goal, but was coming from the attacker's backside, so he's never going to cut that off if the cross is laid in as nice as it was. Edu really wasn't hustling to make his play there, and Williams was trying to salvage it."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thanksbastards,3,Sun Apr 19 23:33:12 2015 UTC,"I don't understand anything Curtin did in the second half. He told the team to sit back on our lead and momentum and then made a bunch of bad substitutions. It's dumbfound in but I still think we have all the pieces to win, besides a good manager."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,4,Sun Apr 19 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"to be fair, if your plan is to sit back, those aren't terrible substitutions. Carroll isn't much going forward or making plays but he can make a tackle, and Wenger is flexible and can be called to lay back or push forward if the need arises. Considering the bench options there wasn't much else to do at that point."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thanksbastards,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:34:43 2015 UTC,What's the point of making the tackle when you can't then make the pass to hold onto possession? You break up the play but the opposition immediately repossesses the ball and reloads. Bonus points if your teammates start a run anticipating a break and are now a step behind the play.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:22:16 2015 UTC,"Don't know if you've missed it, but the team cares squat about possession this season. I'm not saying it was the right call tactically, but it makes sense if that's how Curtin wanted to finish out the match."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"If the strategy is to lose, then he's doing great. I'm not sure what world Curtin is living in if he thinks 30% possession is acceptable."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,2,Mon Apr 20 00:28:34 2015 UTC,And some other pieces. I feel like this is his first mistake but I see what he was trying to do. They put in a bunch of attacking player you counter with fresh legs on the defense and he thought we could hold which we couldnt. Lets see if he learns from it before we burn the witch.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,spqr-king,3,Sun Apr 19 23:36:28 2015 UTC,We needed attacking players that could pin their fullbacks back and hit themon a counter. Ayuk would have kept them honest. Wenger does nothing but take up space.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,2,Sun Apr 19 23:45:12 2015 UTC,I agree I would have put in Ayuk.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:47:40 2015 UTC,The wings are killing us. Our only good true winger is 18.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,zb313,3,Sun Apr 19 23:44:00 2015 UTC,"At what point do the horrible strategies and poor subs become the fault of the coach, as well as the management for providing essentially zero depth on the bench? At this point Curtin is just as conspicuous as  the FO. The result tonight falls squarely on his management of the game.   The worst part is, I'm conditioned to it. As soon as the second half started, we all knew how it would end. The ownership group has established a losing culture and contently sat there while we enabled them with ticket sales and merchandise. Enough is enough. This franchise needs to be cleaned out from the ownership group on down."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thanksbastards,3,Sun Apr 19 23:10:31 2015 UTC,Wenger instead of Ayuk as a sub is mind boggling and Casey was totally ineffective. Williams had a terrible game but Wenger has just totally lost whatever streak he was on at the end of last season. He creates a black hole of offense on whatever side of the field he's playing.   This game would've been at least a draw with better sub decisions.
PhillyUnion,3368m9,4-1-3-2,3,Sun Apr 19 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"Once again, our shoddy backline does us in. Is there a reason Curtin, a former defender, can't get a functioning offside trap? Why is Edu, a great CDM, playing CB when his highest speed backtracking is apparently a swift jog?   I think we have a decent set of players, but the coaching is terrible. Curtin really could have used time as the Assistant Manager to learn behind someone who had some years on him. I know everyone's looking for the next Kreis and Porter, but it's not Curtin."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"I get the sentiment, but we need him as a centre-back. He'd be a great DMD on other teams, but we have a need in the back line that comes before midfield needs.   It's a vital position that we can't rely on anyone else at the club to do as well with as he does. It's not perfect, but it's where we're at."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,Krefted,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"Mo is a better CB than DM. That swift jog is worse after he has made one of his meandering runs from midfield since he is so meandering. Besides, Noggy plays better with a true stay-at-home DM."
PhillyUnion,3368m9,thanksbastards,5,Mon Apr 20 11:33:30 2015 UTC,The city of Philadelphia isn't gonna put up with this teams nonsense for much longer. It's bad enough they play out in bumblefuck but the fact that they're this bad is unacceptable.

The SoBs will never lead a protest against the inefficient FO. Once you lose the less diehard fans, we'll be the next Chivas.. Union have had every opportunity to properly claim a spot in the philly sports landscape (big four teams are average, Gold Cup final, entertaining games, city wanting a winner).. But the FO, our depth because of the FO, and Curtin being in over his head is leading to another playoff-less season."

Honestly, I was never expecting us to win this one in the first place, with all the injuries and tired legs. Regardless of the score line, I was legitimately entertained for the third or fourth match in a row. There's life in this group, and that's something we've not had in a while."

PhillyUnion,335810,LocksTheFox,4,Sun Apr 19 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"That's only once   Twice, actually. We played them in the USOC QF"
PhillyUnion,335810,oooooooounbelievable,2,Sun Apr 19 18:21:40 2015 UTC,"Twice! That's 100% more wins, therefore 100% chance of victory!  That's how stats work, right?"
PhillyUnion,335810,atypicalclothespin,2,Sun Apr 19 20:17:04 2015 UTC,as per Kevin Kinkhead I'm not expecting our best line up tonight. could see a draw honestly
PhillyUnion,335810,FatboyAFC,3,Sun Apr 19 19:04:14 2015 UTC,I wouldn't take what he said as necessarily bad. The improving injury situation could mean a full game of Maidana. And maybe short turnaround means Pfeffer getting the start over Noguiera who was hurt/exhausted after last game. Obviously rather have Nogs but not if it burns him out.
PhillyUnion,335810,atypicalclothespin,2,Sun Apr 19 19:08:04 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Pfeffer and Maidana on the pitch together. I think Noguiera could really use a rest since he hasn't been playing as great this year and it might help him recover.
PhillyUnion,335810,FatboyAFC,2,Sun Apr 19 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd like to see the three of them on at once. I think they are our three best technical players, and our midfield would be able to easily out-possess teams. And I think Nogs and Pfeffer are good enough defensively  and smart enough to realize that when one goes forward the other holds back so we don't have all three of them going up at once. Agreed that Noguiera probably needs a rest this game though, or at least shouldnt  come on until like the 60th"
PhillyUnion,335810,everydayasOrenG,2,Sun Apr 19 19:20:58 2015 UTC,I like that idea a lot. Doubt we'll see it happen soon with Pfeffer going to the USMNT (U20) and Curtin frequently calling on Lahoud as the DM. I wouldn't mind them trying a 4-5-1 with Pfeffer and Nogs slotted behind Maidana in midfield.
PhillyUnion,335810,everydayasOrenG,2,Sun Apr 19 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind them trying a 4-5-1 with Pfeffer and Nogs slotted behind Maidana in midfield.   so you're suggesting   gaddis-vittoria-edu-williams  noguiera-----pfeffer   ayuk--------------wenger       maidana    aristeguieta   awesome formatting, i know. i like that with le toux to the bench, and him and sapong able to come in to replace Ayuk/Wenger/Maidana, with Casey/Sapong also able to sub up top and Lehoud available as a DM if we get a lead..."

PhillyUnion,3367dw,TheMasyman,4,Sun Apr 19 22:47:52 2015 UTC,"TT was pretty spot on, both with the U's bizarre roster moves and their godawful tactics.   He got bonus points for correctly asserting the M'Bolhi move was on the shoulders of Sak and not Curtin."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"Eyebrows were raised when Blake was signed. People were straight up pissed and confused when Mbholi was signed. It really makes you wonder what we would look like if we spent or money wisely on a good forward or LB or something besides a GK.   I know it's been said before but our FO is fucked and that can only go ON for so long. Eventually us fans and our supporters groups will do something drastic. You can only fool fans and especially Philly fans for so long, sooner or later we won't put up with it."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,Too_many_hippos,4,Sun Apr 19 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"Read up on Nick's management of the Metrostars before they were sold. His strategy was to target a ""casual"" soccer crowd as this would provide a better return on limited investments in the team, and he was roundly criticized for ignoring hardcore fans. He's pulling the exact same moves in Philly."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"This explains it. I always hear stuff about his negative past with owning clubs, but I never checked it out. How did this man get to our Union?   Sigh, I hope things will change."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,Too_many_hippos,2,Sun Apr 19 23:57:50 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it, the more I feel Philly should have started a USL or NASL team first, and grown it into an MLS franchise. Creating a team out of whole cloth, in such a short amount of time, meant that there wasn't really time to determine who or what was going to work management-wise. As a result we got anyone willing to, and able to afford it, involved as part of the ownership group. Now we're in the situation where the FO can't build a winning team, but holds all the cards as they essentially paid for what we do have."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:03:09 2015 UTC,So do you think he bought M'Bohli because of his World Cup pedigree? Basically targeting those potential new soccer fans won over by last summer's WC?
PhillyUnion,3367dw,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:52:27 2015 UTC,Check this out for more info: http://www.brotherlygame.com/2014/10/22/6943487/keeper-go-round  Good background on Sack's involvement in managing the GK position on the various teams he's been involved with.
PhillyUnion,3367dw,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:56:52 2015 UTC,Oh I have no doubt it was Sak's decision and that he's a bit gk obsessed. What I'm curious about is how to reconcile this expensive half mil acquisition with his philosophy of catering to casual fans.
PhillyUnion,3367dw,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"Name recognition, I would say. What other WC standout could you have gotten for under half a million?"
PhillyUnion,3367dw,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt in my mind that Sac looked at M'Bohli as a potential steal given his national team pedigree and performance at the WC (and disregarding all the red flags in his club career) and given the fact they were trying to trade MacMath as early as before the 2014 season even began, it makes even more sense why they would pull the trigger, but I'm not so sure an Algerian goalkeeper with a funny name and aloof presence on the field was someone who would draw in the casual soccer moms to the stadium and kids buying up Dempsey and Jones jerseys after watching our matches against Ghana and Belgium. I mean, maybe that was it, but I dunno.."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"He was very high on M'Bolhi at the time (the ""little tournament in Brazil"" and all that). Who knows, in his mind this might have carried the same weight. At the same time, he's wanted to put his hand in personnel moves from year one. There's been a theme of wanting to pretend to be GM, then wash your hands and step away when the move doesn't work out.  I don't really know, he's a guy who can't run a soccer franchise, and likes goalkeepers... like, really likes them apparently."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"He absolutely wants to play GM and definitely is keeper obsessed. I'm hopeful that the one positive thing that can come from this debacle is that he will be on a very tight leash from now on and hopefully with Muelensteen in the picture, the roles are becoming more clearly defined (which was a big part of them hiring him)."
PhillyUnion,3367dw,thelostdolphin,0,Mon Apr 20 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"We deserve better, for sure. And I'm no FO apologist, but without Nick we don't have a team."
PhillyUnion,3331wd,mtommyboy,7,Sun Apr 19 01:21:33 2015 UTC,"Good. Maybe he can raise his value so they'll pay us for him. That's a good level for him, but can't do it consistently in MLS."
PhillyUnion,3331wd,pefsu13,3,Sun Apr 19 01:34:03 2015 UTC,Agreed. He had a few really solid games with us early on but then just completely fell off. It was a shame to watch really. Who knows maybe he will come back and find some form and at least be a solid depth player?
PhillyUnion,3331wd,atypicalclothespin,3,Sun Apr 19 01:40:51 2015 UTC,This sometimes it just confidence that needs to be rebuilt and honestly we can always use more depth.

PhillyUnion,32ww5d,M4_doop,11,Fri Apr 17 11:45:29 2015 UTC,"There has been a steady drop off in enthusiasm these last five years. After the new team buzz and the first play off appearance hype (when we were actually a pretty decent team) faded it's continued.   Every year I tell myself earlier and earlier that I won't re-up next year, but I have every year so far. After the first few games this season, I'll admit, I questioned what I was doing. Turning down invites to concerts and festivals and parties because I had to come watch the Union lose was getting tiresome.   I kind of don't mind saying that I'm a bit of a fair-weather fan. The wins and losses don't matter too much to me, but it's the attitude and the direction that do. After Curtin came out and dropped M'bolhi and put the bad performances on his shoulders and the team came out with a renewed vigor, even if they lost against NYC I would have felt better. I'm a huge sixers fan too. I don't mind the losing as long as we're working towards something.   Now I believe that the U has a better direction. I'm still not 100% sold on Curtin, and I think the FO needs to reevaluate their priorities, but we've got a squad of guys who want to win and don't want to disappoint us, the fans."
PhillyUnion,32ww5d,Mike81890,4,Fri Apr 17 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"The long winless streaks can be pretty rough but the highs, Like last week's stoppage time game winner, make the tickets worth it. I'll be a STH for as long as I can afford the tickets. At the very least it's an excuse to get together with friends, day drink, enjoy the beauty of Chester and harass some professional athletes. Win or lose I'll be a couple rows behind you in 135 doopin my head off"
PhillyUnion,32ww5d,Dpw22393,2,Fri Apr 17 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"And this season the atmosphere has been about on par for the last couple years.

PhillyUnion,32ww5d,Dpw22393,3,Fri Apr 17 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i started watching during the 2011 playoffs and got hooked.

PhillyUnion,32ww5d,deadbee22,4,Fri Apr 17 17:15:25 2015 UTC,"As a Founding Member (Section 127),  a good word for this year would be: interesting.  I believe we are better than we have been playing, but the M'Bolhi disaster is  reminder of the crap that is our Front Office.  To me, if the team can get healthy, there is no reason they can't make the playoffs... as the East is terrible.  The proper  addition or two (a real LB, a winger) in the summer will go miles for this team... but that means the F/O needs to come through.  Lately though, it is good to see them right the ship from the disastrous start. For me though, I love soccer.  I watch all leagues (I am an Aston Villa guy in the EPL), and a Union guy til I die!  I'll support the team no matter what, but I'm not afraid to call out the F/O, or whoever when it's necessary.  #FREETHISFRANCHISE"
PhillyUnion,32ww5d,DatMatt316,3,Fri Apr 17 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"I'm also a new STH, and also in 135 (row E). 100% agree about being so close to the away support last week and the atmosphere is great. Maybe I'm just still shiny and new to the ST thing but I have no regrets at all. Even if we suck and disappoint I just love the fact I have a team to support. I won't be at Sunday's game, but I'll be at almost every other this season. Any other 135ers feel free to say what's up if you see a blonde dude with a right arm full of tattoos lol"

It's getting harder and harder to pass up gorgeous days doing other, fun things rather than spending 6-7 hours total to go to/from a game that ends up sucking.  Now keep in mind, I sit midfield so I'm here primarily for the soccer itself, which I think should sufficiently explain my lack of enthusiasm at the moment. I'm seriously pining for the performance and atmosphere of the Open Cup final. I know it's not likely to come around often, but even a playoff game would be nice."

PhillyUnion,32vf03,DatMatt316,16,Sat Apr 18 05:09:54 2015 UTC,"The trio of Sapong, Maidana, and Pfeffer really gave the offense a boost.  Pfeffer in particular looks really confident with the ball and sees things that many of our other players don't.  That kid has a bright future.  Announcers were spot on with the constant standing around the Union do.  Half the time Nog has the ball, everyone else just stares at him.  The movement got a lot better (up front at least) after the subs.    I can't figure out Edu.  He really makes our defense a ton better but it's like his brain stops working occasionally.  He can't lose that ball at the end of the game to give up the potential game winning shot."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,ricker2005,9,Fri Apr 17 01:13:12 2015 UTC,That last point I totally agree with I think he hates playing CB so much he goes into a coma from boredom.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,spqr-king,2,Fri Apr 17 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"It's weird for sure.  He was playing really well for a nice chunk of the game and then all of a sudden he just lackadaisically (man that word never looks right) went to clear an easy cross, it hit his shin, and went right to a NYCFC player all alone on the other side of the box.  Then he went back to playing really well.  Then he forgot that the CB can't dribble the ball up the field and then lose it with 30 seconds left in the game.    Maybe he is slipping in and out of a coma while still on his feet."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,ricker2005,2,Fri Apr 17 01:23:23 2015 UTC,Honestly its his hatred for the position. He wants to play midfield and he should if we had a CB to replace him. He can be a good defensive mid but we dont have any other CB's at his caliber hopefully he just accepts it and starts kicking ass because he is amazing at it but you can tell he is not enjoying it.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,spqr-king,10,Fri Apr 17 01:39:20 2015 UTC,I don't think Edu fits this team as a DM. He goes too far forward and does too much. We need a guy like Amobi or Lahoud who plays simple balls and stays back to allow Nogueira the freedom to go forward.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,thewizardofosmium,13,Fri Apr 17 01:43:33 2015 UTC,I don't think Edu is as good a DM as he thinks he is.  I've always liked his play at CB better since he has been here.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,spqr-king,2,Fri Apr 17 01:50:25 2015 UTC,I agree I hope he realizes his importance to our back line and accepts it because as of now I think he is not impressed with his station.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,spqr-king,2,Fri Apr 17 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"Also can you imagine doing a Ayuk, Pfeffer, and Maidana swap teams would be going nuts because they all have so much energy and speed after their players are already worn."

PhillyUnion,32vf03,FlashKelly,5,Fri Apr 17 01:13:27 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's been painful watching the left side of our attack just disappear.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,GoldBlooded10,3,Fri Apr 17 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"Let Wenger compose himself and let Le Toux play the left and Ayuk play the right. Start one of Maidana, Sapong, or Pfeffer and give Wenger a rest."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,thelostdolphin,12,Fri Apr 17 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"Can't believe Saunders saved that Pfeffer shot off the deflection. Oh well, love what Sapong brings to the table.   Hopefully we're not too banged up for Sunday but happy with 4 pts in the meantime."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,jpoRS,13,Fri Apr 17 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"What can be said about Aristeguieta that hasn't already been said? Seba and Wenger need to take some time off. They're not clicking and we need to sit them down before something preventable happens. Ayuk is fighting for minutes and deserves to keep getting them, but he can't be our only attacking mid. Lahoud ... I'll own up, he's been playing much better than I thought he could. Good job Mike. But we had no control in midfield and no ability to move the ball forward. Not ideal. Gaddis-Edu-Vitoria-Williams is as good a back line as could be hoped for. They were under a lot of pressure this game and didn't show many cracks. I'm not sure what's bigger, John McCarthy's heart or his balls. This kid is going to give me a heart attack. He hasn't put a foot wrong yet, but I feel like it's only a matter of time. There was some concern when we signed Sapong as to what we were actually getting. It seems like we got the good one. Pfeffer needs to calm down a bit. He is a capable player but he's leaning too heavily on his physicality.   No reason to be anything but happy about 4 out of 6 from NY2, but I'm concerned that   we didn't play well enough to do it again. We're not out of the woods yet."

If he doesn't, and keeps coming off his line like that, it's going to hurt and it's going to hurt badly. If he does have the skills we've got an embarrassment of riches again, and I don't envy Curtin having to tell Blake (or him) to take a seat."

If you're Curtin and maybe you are worried about hurting their confidence, this upcoming game is the time to do it. He's got the built in excuse of 3 games in 7 days or whatever it is and having to rotate guys to rest them."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,thelostdolphin,5,Fri Apr 17 01:12:49 2015 UTC,Le Toux keeps choking in front of goal. Wenger just looks tired and unhappy. I can't figure out what his deal is this season.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Fri Apr 17 01:20:06 2015 UTC,he seems to be lacking confidence among potentially more things. I think giving him a rest and then having him score a goal will go a long way to fixing things.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,marble617,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:36:21 2015 UTC,It's probably just that it took us 5 games to win  hopefully
PhillyUnion,32vf03,GoldBlooded10,3,Fri Apr 17 01:40:37 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Pfeffer or Sapong replace Wenger at the start next week. Let Le Toux play Wenger's spot and allow him to create plays like the first goal Saturday and let either Sapong play up top or put Pfeffer in the middle. Perhaps start both (or Maidana) and let Noguiera rest.

PhillyUnion,32vf03,atypicalclothespin,6,Fri Apr 17 01:08:41 2015 UTC,Thought he was much more solid in the second half especially. He made some questionable decisions in the first but played a good game overall.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,in_the_against,6,Fri Apr 17 01:09:03 2015 UTC,And that is how you steal a point on the road.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,spqr-king,7,Fri Apr 17 01:11:10 2015 UTC,Lets not get so choosy all of a sudden we were lucky to get a point tonight and im damn happy about that. A tie away while down a goal is a great thing compared to last season and you can see they wanted it. I think we have some key components that need to be moved around but overall solid game.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,Mountainhawk98,7,Fri Apr 17 01:21:00 2015 UTC,1) Good point. 2) That pitch is such garbage.  I've seen wider U10 fields.

Maybe it's because he's finally getting into form after essentially riding the bench or because Edu is a helpful presence in the backline, or maybe both and other things but i'm glad to see him improving."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,EdBacon,3,Fri Apr 17 02:53:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm really liking Edu and Vitoria together in the back. They've looked good so far.

PhillyUnion,32vf03,JoeBenzon,2,Fri Apr 17 01:09:20 2015 UTC,It was an ugly game all around. I felt sick watching through the first half with the ball constantly knocked back and forth across that postage stamp pitch and the camera lurching from one end of the field to the other.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,truckloadof4skin,4,Fri Apr 17 01:16:53 2015 UTC,We stole one from there hehe. McCarthy is gonna be interesting to watch...he had some questionable decisions and got lucky Williams decided to be amazing tonight.  I will take the points that we can get.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,AdFinemFidelis,4,Fri Apr 17 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"I thought McCarthy played very poorly to start and made puzzling decisions.  He's in that adrenaline phase right now and we aren't quite sure what we have from him.  To be fair, we have seen some bad play from him which made me think that Curtin is just treading water with him until Blake is ready.  On the other hand, he's 22 and with the right development he could be our future and the second half today he looked like just that.  It was easily his best half so far and must have been a huge confidence builder.  I can't wait to see what he does Sunday back at PPL.  Attendance at the moment looks like it will be pretty mediocre, so let's make sure to get out and support this kid http://ev15.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?linkID=global-union&ticketCode=GS:GLOBAL-UNION:UNION15:U04:&groupCode=UNIONSG&shopperContext=&pc=&caller=&appCode=&cgc=&prc=&ppc=&psc=&sm=1"

PhillyUnion,32vf03,atypicalclothespin,3,Fri Apr 17 01:25:29 2015 UTC,"All in all, that's a healthy point. Some very inspiring triangular passing, but there's only so much you can do on that size pitch. Both teams really had to resort to smash-and-grab because of all the congestion. Oh, and Toledo sucks, not that he blew the game for us(this time), but he really really sucks."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,Dean_Moriarty,3,Fri Apr 17 01:31:54 2015 UTC,it's crazy how much the game changes once we get chaco into the game. Also I really think CJ is making a case for starting minutes.  Great goal by him. We didn't play great but a draw and 4 points in 2 games is big for this team. there's hoping for a big result for Sunday!
PhillyUnion,32vf03,in_the_against,3,Fri Apr 17 01:11:52 2015 UTC,CJ has been playing well but not better than Fernando for me. And our midfield seems to flow much better when we have 1 up top rather than two. Although maybe Fernando and CJ will find chemistry together if they get more minutes.

PhillyUnion,32vf03,EdBacon,5,Fri Apr 17 03:06:11 2015 UTC,"We should have won that game against an undermanned NYC side. I've been saying all preseason that NYC didn't have the defensive players to really succeed this year. I am glad to see I am justified in this.  That said, we found a way to come back. The Zolos of recent years would not have fought back. Baby steps.  Also, Ayuk is quickly becoming my favorite player. He fights for every inch on the soccer field and plays much bigger than his small size lets on. Now he just needs to improve his decision making which comes with age.  Also, Wenger needs to take a long sit on the bench."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,EdBacon,6,Fri Apr 17 01:08:55 2015 UTC,Wenger and Seba.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,EdBacon,4,Fri Apr 17 01:11:00 2015 UTC,Seba missing shots in the box is KILLING me inside
PhillyUnion,32vf03,spqr-king,2,Fri Apr 17 01:14:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Ayuk is wasted as a starter. Let him on in the 60th or 70th minute to run at a tired defense. He's least effective at the start of a game. I just don't know who else to play out right. Maybe Sapong when he's fit?"
PhillyUnion,32vf03,spqr-king,3,Fri Apr 17 01:13:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll take 60 minutes of Ayuk over 90 minutes of Andrew Wenger."
PhillyUnion,32vf03,mtommyboy,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:20:52 2015 UTC,Ideally you find a left footed midfielder to play in his place.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,jiggybluff,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:30:14 2015 UTC,We could just use a midfielder like Zach who can cut inside.
PhillyUnion,32vf03,mswiss,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:41:11 2015 UTC,On the left wing? I'd worry he'll occupy the same space as Maidana.

PhillyUnion,32rz20,timofree,3,Thu Apr 16 19:57:30 2015 UTC,"Injury report has Maidana, Aristegueta, and Edu as questionable. I have faith in these three guys playing if they can, but I also think with short turn around from Saturday (and heading into Sunday) cooling them wouldn't be unwise. Especially since it appears Sapong is getting closer and closer to match fit, and Casey is good for 20, I think we do fine on attack considering how shaky NY2's defense is.  Defensively an absent Edu is concerning. We don't have a solid CB pairing without him, and I think his best shot at getting back with the national team is as a CB. If we had an elite keeper maybe it would be fine to be a little weak there, but as much as we love John McCarthy he isn't elite. On the brighter side though Williams should get us a few faux-corners on NY2's comically narrow field.  As for the opposition, I think Mix being in Texas is going to hurt them. He broke up a lot of Union possession last game and in general has seemed like a bigger part of their strategy than people are giving him credit for. It's also worth noting that we are fortunate to get to face NY2 twice this early in the season, as whatever you think of the team or him they will get better once Lampard gets here and we have the opportunity to steal some points before they get better.  This is very much a winnable game, and we shouldn't say no to any points we can find. But a draw wouldn't be a bad result (4/6 out of an Eastern opponent is nothing to sneeze at) and it is important to not over extend ourselves when New England is coming to town so soon. I predict another 2-1 victory.  Suspected Lineup: McCarthy; Gaddis, Vitoria, Edu, Williams; Lahoud, Nogueira; Wenger/LeToux, Pfeffer, Ayuk; Sapong."

PhillyUnion,32ljqj,thelostdolphin,15,Wed Apr 15 07:12:38 2015 UTC,"If MLB can make this work, MLS should be able to make Aristeguieta work."
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,Timothy-H,8,Tue Apr 14 22:01:12 2015 UTC,"If Carter-Williams fits on an NBA jersey, Aristeguieta should be easy enough"
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,FlapjackJackson,6,Tue Apr 14 22:48:15 2015 UTC,They should be thankful they never signed Vennegoor of Hesselink.
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,rabmcmlxxxvii,3,Tue Apr 14 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe they can't go it at the stadium but you might be able to order it from the team online store, the MLS store, or soccer.com"
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,JoeBenzon,2,Wed Apr 15 08:47:41 2015 UTC,"I saw a jersey at the park this weekend, so I am assuming that person just had the customization done elsewhere."
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,onuzim,2,Wed Apr 15 02:04:26 2015 UTC,I saw some people buy Aristeguieta jerseys at the pro shop at the last game.
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,spqr-king,2,Wed Apr 15 03:08:35 2015 UTC,If they want to make money they better get over that. The man is 23 and our leading scorer so far this season if he keeps that and his awesome attitude up he could sell a ton of jerseys.
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,CouldBeBetterForever,2,Wed Apr 15 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"I just checked, and you can do it on this site. I typed in his name, and it didn't say anything about it being too long. http://www.worldsoccershop.com/"
PhillyUnion,32ljqj,jpoRS,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:30:20 2015 UTC,Is it okay if I make a bad joke? Okay good.   Maybe you should try looking for an Aristeguieta jersey.

PhillyUnion,32m8ky,MrChips217,2,Tue Apr 14 22:33:00 2015 UTC,Best Philly player for DGW?
PhillyUnion,32m8ky,Timothy-H,2,Tue Apr 14 22:45:56 2015 UTC,I would go with either Noguiera or even McCarthy.
PhillyUnion,32m8ky,get_down_mrpresident,2,Tue Apr 14 22:51:42 2015 UTC,I'm just worried about McCarthy at the tiny Yankee stadium field. Seems like any game there has potential for lots of goals conceded. Nogs seems like a safe bet though.
PhillyUnion,32m8ky,Old_Professor,2,Tue Apr 14 22:57:05 2015 UTC,McCarthy because he is cheap and gonna play is the only reason I would suggest him.
PhillyUnion,32m8ky,thelostdolphin,2,Tue Apr 14 22:57:48 2015 UTC,Think McCarthy will play both games? What is Blake's status?
PhillyUnion,32m8ky,LocksTheFox,2,Tue Apr 14 23:25:50 2015 UTC,"I'm worried with Edu possibly injured and not playing CB. If White is back in, that makes me very nervous."

PhillyUnion,32ikea,10phillyphan,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"hahaha asking for trouble ;-) i'm not a Rangers fan so you're good...but the away supporters section is actually across the field from the home supporters...if you know Yankee Stadium, the left field bleachers sit the Third Rail and such, the away supporters are second level somewhere behind home plate.  There haven't been any incidents that I've seen, obviously if people act ridiculous it may get out of hand but show respect get respect back is what I always go by"
PhillyUnion,32ikea,10phillyphan,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:58:19 2015 UTC,"ahaha I might! Lol who is your team? Yes I did see the map when I was getting the tix. But my cousin isn't as big as a fan as I am so I just got normal seats. A little bit of heckling both ways is fun, that's what I hope for"

PhillyUnion,32dakl,LocksTheFox,7,Sun Apr 12 20:56:21 2015 UTC,From this we can extrapolate that our players get worse as they get older. We clearly need to try fielding a team of unstoppable 13 year olds.

PhillyUnion,329tha,EdBacon,16,Sat Apr 11 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"Team still has serious problems to take care of, but the performance was head and shoulders over the loss to SKC if just for the change in attitude alone. Backline looks better that they can communicate with their keeper and build some confidence. They still have serious problems holding onto the ball. Wenger, and Pfeffer don't make for a very technically skilled midfield, although I thought Lahoud was serviceable playing with Nogs."
PhillyUnion,329tha,rabidfrodo,2,Sat Apr 11 22:09:35 2015 UTC,Pfeffer looked good I'd say with more game time he will come into his own. I'd rather have a young player whose a little worse than a guy who has played for years.
PhillyUnion,329tha,EdBacon,2,Sun Apr 12 13:07:50 2015 UTC,"I think Pfeffer got knocked off the ball too easily, and wasn't able to create much in the way of attacking chances. He didn't see much meaningful possession. I don't think that's an indictment of his skill, just his relative inexperience. The team also has a lot of issues with off the ball movement which wasn't helping. But given more time I think he's going to get a lot better."
PhillyUnion,329tha,rabidfrodo,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:14:35 2015 UTC,Yep agreed. I think he looked better in his first start. Still think he could be one our best players in a year or two.
PhillyUnion,329tha,tracks28,14,Sun Apr 12 23:10:34 2015 UTC,That was a great game. Love McCarthy's postgame interview.
PhillyUnion,329tha,thelostdolphin,15,Sat Apr 11 22:09:41 2015 UTC,Ayuk is really fun to watch. He really needs to work on those flips though. Thankfully Seba was there to properly teach him.

It seemed like we where to quick to play long ball soccer for a majority of the match.  Other than that i though we played well. ayuk looks great and having le toux up top was a nice change of pace.   I was happy to see maidana make a late appearance hopefully he is ready to start next week!.  DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!

PhillyUnion,329tha,TriflingHotDogVendor,6,Sun Apr 12 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"So Let Toux gets a wound that would require 5 stitches.   He's bleeding profusely. After he runs into the video board,  the ref just says ""play on. ""   The ref lets the GK take a goal kick.  Le Toux literally had to walk to the middle of the field and lie down and then WAIT through some marginally attacking soccer from Man City II and only then, finally,   like 45 seconds later, the ball is finally knocked out and the ref stops the game.   So what if he knicked his brachial artery or it was a compound fracture?  Either is a medical emergency.  The guy is clearly bleeding.   And bleeding profusely.   It was already a dead ball, ref.  I've literally never been more pissed at a ref in my life. It's one thing to blow a call, but when a dude losses a pint of blood, maybe you should blow  the whistle.  Injury time is there for a reason."

So I think as long as we are getting good results and McCarthy doesn't have any blunders he has a good chance of hanging on to the job.

PhillyUnion,32bqud,Mountainhawk98,4,Sun Apr 12 20:47:57 2015 UTC,And Fernando said in one of his early interviews that his only goal this year is to make the Union buy him. Sounds like a win-win for everyone if he stays on this trajectory.

PhillyUnion,32bqud,thelostdolphin,2,Sun Apr 12 14:14:58 2015 UTC,I first cringed a little when Casey was put into the game but he put his head down and did a lot of small things right which helped the team get back on track in the game. Sapong looked great as a sub and brought awesome energy into the game.
PhillyUnion,32bqud,gaparmer,2,Sun Apr 12 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"If Casey gets comfortable being a second half / 70th min guy, I think he can be really successful in that role.   I like CJ a lot too.

PhillyUnion,32bqud,JoeBenzon,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that Williams and Gaddis are only 25 and Wenger is only 24. Even some of our veterans (Maidana, Edu, Nogueira, Lahoud, Vitoria) are only 27-28. We only have 4 players on the roster over 30 in Fabinho, Fred, Carroll and Casey. I could be wrong, but I think we're actually the youngest team in MLS right now."
PhillyUnion,32bqud,DrewGo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:26:28 2015 UTC,If we could drop all four of those last players we would probably be more competitive honestly I dont dislike them but they are past their prime and taking up cap space.
PhillyUnion,32bqud,DrewGo,2,Mon Apr 13 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that. I'm not saying I think Casey and Carroll should start, but I think having a veteran presence in the locker room and on the field is important. You want a few guys who have been there before to help teach the young guys. They're also probably not taking up that much cap space, since three of them had their contracts reworked this off season."
PhillyUnion,32bqud,DrewGo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"I think Nogs and Le Toux fill that roll on the field? Im not saying they are not an asset in some way but they are not on the field often enough to have an impact on our younger players and honestly I dont think they have the skill level. Its not like Kaka, Villa, or someone of that caliber. Like I said its just my opinion I like them as players and as people they seem great I just would be more concerned about giving younger players more time and finding more skilled players to play that senior role."
PhillyUnion,32bqud,DrewGo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:54:11 2015 UTC,"You mentioning Le Toux reminded me he is also over 30. That's 5 players over 30. Still a pretty young team, I think, for the most part.   I agree that it's important to give young players a chance to play and to develop. But, to be fair, I think we're doing that this season with Nando, Wenger, Pfeffer, Ayuk and McCarthy (all 24 or younger). We've also been developing Williams and Gaddis at fullback for years now (both only 25). People forget how young they are because they already have so much MLS experience, which is a good thing. It shows that this team is giving young players a real shot and a chance to earn their spot.  I also don't believe that youth is ALWAYS the answer. We need to win, and right now there is no doubt in my mind that Casey is better equipped to come in late and change the outcome of a game than Dzenan Catic. I'm excited about Catic like everyone else, but I think he needs to spend some time in Harrisburg before he can make the jump to MLS. Casey is a seasoned vet who knows just how to throw a wrench in the gears of the opposition (just look at how he got in the way of the keeper on Nogs stoppage time goal). Carroll had a really solid game against SKC, and even though the outcome wasn't good, he can read a game and break up play like no one else. His play helped us keep SKC out of the game until the last few minutes. People get down on Fabinho, but I don't really understand why. He makes mistakes, but he also makes some really great plays. That's sort of his game. He's a high risk, high reward kind of guy. He's also only depth. He wont see the field this season unless Williams and Gaddis are hurt. And honestly, I don't think there are any other teams (besides Houston with Corey Ashe) who are just killing it with LB depth. Fred... okay yeah. I think I agree with you on Fred. Any minutes he sees this season are probably just robbing someone else a chance to prove themselves (especially after that ridiculous slap). But when everyone else is hurt or suspended... I guess you gotta put someone in there, right?   TL;DR I think the Union have plenty of youth on the team, and I think those guys are getting their fair shot. Getting rid of our older veteran guys isn't the answer."
PhillyUnion,32bqud,kav138,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:33:34 2015 UTC,I just think for senior options we could do better. I don't think any of our senior options are who we need right now to teach our guys. They all had good seasons in the past but none of them were superstars which is what other teams are getting for their senior players. I dont think youth is always the answer as well but we need to bring in someone who has been a champion and is trying to end their career somewhere and teach the young guns. Think about the benefit our younger players would have learning from a Drogba or a Klose rather than Fred or Casey. I think its a legitimate conversation the FO should have especially if we can get Mbolhi out for relatively cheap.   Also I wouldnt want to just dump them off I think they have value just not what I would be doing personally if I had free reign for a day.
PhillyUnion,32bqud,kav138,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, sure, if we could bring in a Drogba or a Klose, I'm all for it. But the front office and Jim Curtin have said many times that Philly is not going to be a team that will bring in big names like that. We're never going to have a superstar, not with this ownership group anyway. And honestly I'm not convinced that this is the wrong way to run a team. We're investing in the youth program, we're building a culture of ""team first."" I'm sure this fan base would love a David Villa, Kaka, or Stephen Gerrard, I know I would, but I think we can win without one.   Oh, for what it's worth, Brian Carroll and Conor Casey have both won the MLS Cup. Fred and Le Toux have both won the US Open Cup."

I'm really excited to see what our attack looks like once everyone is healthy. Aristeguieta, Sapong, Chaco, Casey, and Pfeffer is a strong collection of players. They have their weaknesses but everyone in MLS has weaknesses. Plus Le Toux and Wenger have been off to a rough start this season, but we all know they are capable of being better than MLS average. And we still haven't seen what McLaughlin can offer. If that's the bottom of our depth chart, we're in amazing shape. Once everyone gets back in shape. So hopefully Aristeguieta can get the rest he needs off the field and the support we all need on field so he doesn't burn out on us."

The dialogue becomes ""great strike by opposition"" rather than ""horrible goal tending by the Union"". The only thing that can happen is improvement, even if things stay the same."

PhillyUnion,328e69,FlashKelly,3,Sat Apr 11 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling a lot of Union fans see this game as a sort of fresh start. let's put the past behind us and move forward. M'bolhi really is a great scape goat to blame our troubles on, let's believe that we can win and do this. protect our fucking house and score fuckin golazos!!!!"
PhillyUnion,328e69,KingArbs52,2,Sat Apr 11 19:30:02 2015 UTC,Anybody have a working stream?
PhillyUnion,328e69,Too_many_hippos,4,Sat Apr 11 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"Ideally both Maidana and Nogueira will start. Edu in the backline, and Ayuk on the wing. Le Toux on the bench.   If we go 4-4-2 again I'd rather see Sapong start over Le Toux up top.    And if Maidana can't play or start I'd be fine giving Pfeffer a chance to make amends."
PhillyUnion,328e69,jpoRS,2,Sat Apr 11 14:45:37 2015 UTC,Yea I'd love to see the kind of speed and creativity Ayuk and Sapong could bring to the field together for a long period of the game.

PhillyUnion,326w4v,UnbiasedOnionRing,10,Sat Apr 11 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"The area that the stadium is in is not developed, so there's really nothing to do around there.  You should enjoy Philadelphia for a few hours before kickoff though."
PhillyUnion,326w4v,JoeBenzon,5,Sat Apr 11 03:27:38 2015 UTC,"Just going to reiterate what everyone else on here said: there's nothing within walking distance of PPL Park.  History lesson: The riverfront area where PPL Park is located had been undeveloped for the longest time. The state was offering lots of tax incentives for developing there. Feb 28, 2008 was when MLS announced the expansion team, and shortly thereafter the decision for putting the stadium where it is today in Chester. The hope was that it would be a catalyst to further develop the waterfront area.....and then the financial collapse of 2008 happened.  So yeah, there's nothing good in walking distance but AT LEAST WE HAVE OUR OWN SOCCER SPECIFIC STADIUM! Friendly banter aside, I hope you have a good trip and go home with zero points ;)  EDIT: Didn't realize you asked for stadium tips! I'm guessing you're likely to be sitting in the away supporters group in the corner. You can't walk under the Sons of Ben section unless you have a ticket for those sections, so for drinks and food just stick to your side of the concourse. It's the same stuff on both sides, except for the Union fan shop (which I don't think you have any interest in anyway).  Before the match the team will have activities going on in the Plaza outside the Stadium. Additionally the Sons of Ben (/r/SonsOfBen) are doing a tailgate if you want to venture there. Expect lots of banter-it may or maynot happen, but they'll be respectful so long as you are too."
PhillyUnion,326w4v,peewoah1,3,Sat Apr 11 11:42:48 2015 UTC,"Your drop off won't be within walking distance of anything worthwhile.  Inside the stadium food wise there's a couple stands that have specialty items (BBQ, fried pickles, loaded hot dogs) only available at one stand. Crab Fries are always a good choice, especially if you've never them before. There's also a DogFish deck above section 101/102.  You may want to check with your trip leaders before making plans though. With numbers like your group is bringing, you might be escorted from the busses to your seats and maybe even sectioned off."

After last game, I was so pissed with this team, top to bottom, except for a select few players. But Curtain showing that he has the balls and the ability to make a big decision like this did restore some of my confidence."
PhillyUnion,323xg6,elreeso55,8,Fri Apr 10 12:35:05 2015 UTC,"It restored some of my confidence in Curtin, but it also worries me. He may be making all of the decisions, but that doesn't mean Nick and Jay can't still fire him midseason like they tend to do every other year. I get that we're losing now, but I think it might take more than a season and a half to create a winning team and a winning culture. I want to give Curtin a chance to develop as a coach and build the kind of team he wants, and that doesn't happen in one offseason. I know we've got a lot of talent, and I think this team can win now. That being said, I think everyone needs to be a little more patient than we have been. Change doesn't happen overnight. Not with the kind of resources the Union have. Hopefully within the next few years the youth program starts to pay dividends and some of our young players continue to develop. I think we're one of the youngest teams in the league, which could be very good for our future.   TL;DR I like Curtin and I hope ownership gives him the time needed to develop as a coach."

But I still feel a bit uneasy about what's going on. And the marketing blitz for McCarthy has been a bit offputting. I don't know if it's a sign that we won't see Blake? Either way the front office has been on a full out blitz of sucking McCarthy's dick all over social media, and we've yet to even see him play an MLS game. So... We shall see. At least McCarthy can't be worse than M'Bolhi.   And we still have problems with depth at key positions."
PhillyUnion,323xg6,KFCConspiracy,5,Fri Apr 10 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think the whole marketing blitz thing is probably just to distract everyone's attention from the M'Bohli situation as much as possible."

Until they make a decisive move to get rid of Rais and his 1/2 mil salary,  I'll continue to be skeptical of this team. And if they trade him for another GK I might just lose my shit.   With all that said, can't wait for my first match against DC."
PhillyUnion,323xg6,drumlogan,2,Fri Apr 10 12:56:16 2015 UTC,"Well I agree with you. I'm still skeptical, but Curtain, at least, has won some of my trust back. The FO still worries me."

PhillyUnion,323xg6,thelostdolphin,3,Fri Apr 10 12:11:03 2015 UTC,"Per everything I've read and heard from the FO and coaching staff, everyone is really really excited about McCarthy. They think he's the real deal. I think that's why they tried to move MacMath as early as before last season (with no offers, per Kinkead's article from yesterday) and why Blake hasn't been given more opportunities. They just didn't think either of them were that guy. M'Bohli, I think, was supposed to be a stopgap for a couple years who would bring a pedigree to the back line and who could help get us some playoff experience. Then they could ease McCarthy in as the #2 guy under the wing of a World Cup-caliber keeper who inevitably would want a move back to Europe once his value had risen a bit.   Obviously that's not how things played out and McCarthy is getting a chance earlier than intended and with a lot more curious (and frustrated) eyes on him, but I'm pretty excited to see him play. He's got a bit of swagger to him (same with Catic who I also look forward to seeing) and he's said in interviews that he's huge on communication and keeping that open dialogue between defenders and him, which sounds like a breath of fresh air. I'm not going to judge his performance based on this one start (whether he gets a clean sheet or we have another implosion), but I'm going to be paying really close attention to how he interacts with his guys, how things go during set pieces, what happens in the final 15 minutes of the match. Hopefully we'll see some promise."

M'Bolhi was a key player for them last year so. Yeah.  Once I feel like taking on the headache that is MLS rules I'll coach the Union to glory but for now getting promoted out of the championship is a lot more fun.

Which is fine, he just needs to step back and let someone better at that take over."
PhillyUnion,322h05,_axaxaxax,6,Fri Apr 10 04:42:07 2015 UTC,I kind of look at it like Howie Roseman: He's a numbers guy who shouldn't be running the FO. He should be making sure it stays afloat financially.
PhillyUnion,322h05,DakezO,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even trust him with that. Two teams have already folded with his involvement, and there's lots of stuff to raise your eyebrows at with the Union: unpaved parking lots, five years without any practice facilities, unpaid taxes to the city of Chester, and lack of follow through on stadium development plans, etc."
PhillyUnion,322h05,EdBacon,8,Sat Apr 11 01:19:33 2015 UTC,"I'll own up. Not everyone predicted it. I rejoiced when M'Bolhi was announced and honestly am not convinced we've seen the last of him in Philly. But he has no business starting in MLS right now and big changes need to happen if he ever deserves to again. I genuinely hope he gets his head sorted and comes back as the keeper we saw in Brazil, not least of all because we could have another Freddy Adu boat anchor of a contract to deal with."
PhillyUnion,322h05,jpoRS,7,Fri Apr 10 02:08:00 2015 UTC,I was a big part of the Rais hype train. I'll admit I was wrong.

PhillyUnion,322h05,jpoRS,2,Fri Apr 10 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. I thought we could and should upgrade over MacMath. At this point, I want to see Blake as the upgrade."
PhillyUnion,322h05,FlapjackJackson,2,Fri Apr 10 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"I don't recall any specific moments of his play last year, but I remember thinking Blake looked promising but unready. Hopefully a season of training has got him in better shape, but I don't have too high expectations of him. Or McCarthy. Even if these two are just okay they'll be an improvement, but I worry we'll see one rookie mistake from McCarthy and everyone will start crying for his be-hatted head."
PhillyUnion,322h05,jpoRS,2,Fri Apr 10 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"FlapJack, respect for admitting it. Honestly I was a big opponent of the move but if it ended up working out idk if I would have admitted I was wrong."

PhillyUnion,322ym9,bmangan,2,Fri Apr 10 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"I tried to normalize the numbers a bit. The Whoscored numbers are about a half pt higher on average so it makes things hard to compare. I averaged all the scores for Whoscored and rated each player in relation to the average, and did the same for the sub ratings.   Average player was a 6.17 per Whoscored, and a 5.41 per reddit.   Mbohli.       -.5      -3.1  Gaddis         +1.7      +1.5  Edu                 0       +1.3  Vitoria.         +.5       +.4  Fabinho.       +.3         -.7  Carroll.         -.1.        +.5  Lahoud.        +.1        -.4  Ayuk.           +.8       +1.2  Le Toux.       +1.5      0  Wenger.       +.8         -.4  Aristiguieta.  +2         +2.5  Sapong         -.3         -.6  Lee               -.4        -2.4  So it looks like we're understating Lee, MBolhi, Lahoud, Wenger, Fabinho and Le Toux, overrating the positives of Arostiguieta., Ayuk, Carrol and Edu. But we came pretty close on Vitoria, Gaddis, and Sapong.   Thought that was interesting. Obviously Le Toux and Wenger weren't super involved,Lee, Mbolhi and Lahoud are all scapegoated a bit, and Fabinho hate is carrying over from the Dallas game still. Everyone is surprised to see Carroll and Ayuk perform well based on low expectations. And Fernando was just a bit overhyped, but the clear MOTM for us anyway. What I don't get is why this subs rating of Mo is so much higher than Whoscored."
PhillyUnion,322ym9,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Apr 10 17:02:01 2015 UTC,1 thing to note is that I included 0 as an option whoScored.com probably does not include 0 as an option.
PhillyUnion,322ym9,bmangan,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"Oh ok. That makes a difference for sure, but the math I did was estimated enough that I'm sure that would be one of the smaller things causing any problems with it."
PhillyUnion,322ym9,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Apr 10 17:18:01 2015 UTC,I think the higher Mo rating is everyone giving their endorsement for him being moved back to defense and replacing White.
PhillyUnion,322ym9,cjd5286,2,Fri Apr 10 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"That would make perfect sense, basically success in a new position and improvement over the other option at the position. I never thought White looked too bad individually, but Mo was still a noticeable improvement."
PhillyUnion,322ym9,cjd5286,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:11:22 2015 UTC,"I personally thought White was the weakest link in the starting XI. Even more so than M'Bohli, so I was happy with the move and I think Mo, if he embraces it, will do a great job in that position and hopefully make Vitoria more comfortable in the process."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,WJMorris3,24,Thu Apr 9 15:26:09 2015 UTC,"To this point, probably.    However, if the current FO stays in charge of the asylum, no record is safe."

PhillyUnion,3209k8,bit99,13,Thu Apr 9 16:00:10 2015 UTC,Everyone recognized it immediately except for the people who matter in the big decisions.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,_axaxaxax,6,Thu Apr 9 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Two takeaways:    Per Kinkead, ""Even before then, Philadelphia had been trying to move MacMath for months, maybe even a full year."" That adds interesting context to the timing of getting Rais. A big criticism last year, when this all went down, was that if we were going to make a change, we should have moved MacMath earlier when we had more leverage and that was a reflection of the incompetence of the FO, but if we had been attempting to sell him for months to a year prior and no one was interested, then it would suggest his value wasn't very high to begin with (not an indictment of him as a player, but just an honest reflection of what the market was commanding before we even bought a replacement for him).  Speaking of leverage and trade value, it seems to me our best option with M'Bohli is to loan him out and pray that he can turn around his form in a hurry so the mess in Philly looks like an anomaly and not a true reflection of his value. That way maybe we can salvage some of that large salary and use it to upgrade some positions we really need support in.   Edit: spellingz"
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,15,Thu Apr 9 16:06:12 2015 UTC,"The mess in Philly isn't an anomaly though, this is the true m'bolhi. You don't bounce around Russian 2nd division and Bulgaria if you are a real talent and a good teammate."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,TaeKurmulti,2,Thu Apr 9 16:41:24 2015 UTC,Not disputing that that may very well be the case. Just saying that our best hope is that he counters that interpretation in a loan situation and with that and his national team performances at the World Cup and Africa Cup will be enough for us to salvage some money out of the blunder.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much, I'm just going to pray someone will take a gamble on him."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,TaeKurmulti,2,Thu Apr 9 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"I think, in this case, the poor reputation of MLS in the eyes of many other countries (especially when it comes to defending), may work to our advantage. They may give him a pass in a way that he may not get playing in another league and just chalk it up to him not having good enough pieces around him to thrive (which is at least partially valid, though he clearly played a big part too)."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,7,Thu Apr 9 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"My vote goes to Porfirio López, that guy was miserable."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,GoldBlooded10,3,Thu Apr 9 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"In terms of damage to the club I think M'bohli certainly takes the cake, which is a tough pill for me to swallow, as I was a very vocal supporter of his signing and zac's demotion.   As far as worst signing? Porfirio Lopez has to be #1. Just an absolute garbage player. Tough to watch. I'm shocked he was able to find steady work after we dumped him."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,matthew_klein,2,Thu Apr 9 15:50:50 2015 UTC,Also wasn't p Lopez in the team that Montreal just knocked out of the ccl?
PhillyUnion,3209k8,solprose315,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:10:17 2015 UTC,Might agree with Lopez. Crashes out of the team in much fewer games. I'd you add in the money aspect though it might change things.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,solprose315,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:09:38 2015 UTC,"Lopez didn't require nearly as much money as Rais, and he wasn't a cancer."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,FlapjackJackson,5,Fri Apr 10 12:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think there's either a lot of new fans or just short term memories.  What about pajoy, soumare, lopez, kleberson (who just wasn't used)"
PhillyUnion,3209k8,midwesternhousewives,2,Thu Apr 9 20:21:38 2015 UTC,I think this signing is being judged more critically because we're paying him 2-3 times as much as those you listed.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:48:47 2015 UTC,Kleberson was being paid 500k to sit on the bench.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,midwesternhousewives,2,Thu Apr 9 21:20:10 2015 UTC,At least Kleberson came in and won us that game in a last minute set piece.  He did something.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,JoeBenzon,2,Fri Apr 10 01:18:12 2015 UTC,Kleberson was brought on a one year desl to get rid of Adu and his salary. Long-term it was a fine move.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"Ouch. I thought that was a much lower signing.   So with money being even, which would you rank as the worst?"
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Kleberson, but only because he wasn't utilized.  Rais played two opening games just fine and had some decent saves.  Klebs was usually a late sub at best, and only put in a few times.  While the signing with Rais didn't make much sense, the FO (albeit out of touch) tried to fix a goalkeeper issue and bring a star goalie to Philly, and he was at least played.  Kleberson was brought over, aaaand benched. He did score one amazing goal, but that's it.  I liked Kleberson, but it seems like a worse signing to me."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember him scoring a really late goal one time, but that was about it.   I would argue the negative impact he's had on the chemistry of the defenders makes M'Bohli a possibly worse move though we technically have gotten more value out of him than Kleberson (which isn't saying much given how little Kleberson actually played)."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Apr 9 22:21:33 2015 UTC,Kleberson was an expiring contract that was used to get rid of Adu. Also when he was allowed to play he performed. None if the others you listed cost as much. M'bohli could be as bad for this team as what drafting a bad QB is for an NFL team with the amount of money we might have to sink into him.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,rabidfrodo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:05:21 2015 UTC,I don't think pajoy was as bad. The others totally were less effective in less time.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,solprose315,3,Fri Apr 10 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"I'd put Juan Diego González up there. was being paid $193,000 and played in 7 matches in 2010 and 0 in 2011. That was just horrendous."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,foley23,6,Fri Apr 10 01:49:44 2015 UTC,"Eh... He hasn't made as much drama yet as Freddy Adu did. So there's that. We'll see how much drama he makes in the future and how easy it is to get out of his contract. Although his presence alienated MacMath, which was pretty bad."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,KFCConspiracy,3,Thu Apr 9 16:56:11 2015 UTC,I think we all collectively blocked out the Adu memories.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,_axaxaxax,2,Thu Apr 9 18:47:35 2015 UTC,Freddy made very little drama. Hack made the drama by blocking him out.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,FlapjackJackson,0,Fri Apr 10 12:42:26 2015 UTC,"While overrated, I think Adu was more valuable than M'Bolhi. Granted that's not exactly saying much. Adu at least, occasionally, showed flashes of talent. I can't say the same about M'Bolhi."

PhillyUnion,3209k8,notnewton1,4,Fri Apr 10 00:58:51 2015 UTC,I thought it was generally accepted that Nick sac orchestrated the mbohli signing?
PhillyUnion,3209k8,solprose315,-2,Fri Apr 10 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"Carlos Ruiz, Carlos Valdez, Freddie Adu, Austin Berry.  No.  M'bolhi said in an Algerian interview that he wanted to be in Philly and wanted to play for the team. Berry didn't want to be here. McCarthy or Blake don't solve our problems, it's back to yelling at the FO instead of realizing that the players are the problem."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,xenoletum,20,Thu Apr 9 15:31:06 2015 UTC,They all contributed more than Rais did.    Edit: Guys please don't downvote someone just because you disagree!
PhillyUnion,3209k8,Dean_Moriarty,11,Thu Apr 9 15:34:06 2015 UTC,And for less money I believe.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,xenoletum,-5,Thu Apr 9 15:34:32 2015 UTC,Rais was contributing plenty but you can't make every save when you're being hammered by Beasley throw in after Beasley throw in. The defense can't clear a ball to save their lives.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,Dean_Moriarty,15,Thu Apr 9 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"Ruiz was our best striker for a good stretch of time, Valdez was our best defender and team captain for a year or two.  All we had to give up to get Berry was some allocation money.  He didn't cause any problems, he wanted out because the Union weren't going to play him.  Maybe you can argue Adu but I think he had plenty of good moments for the Union, he filled a position of need, there wasn't the behind the scenes drama to bring him here, and ultimately we got him off the books without any lasting damage.  Rais' signing is the reason the Union are mocked about goalkeepers. We had to move MacMath to make room for this guy. We didn't need to spend money on a new keeper when we needed help elsewhere. He was more expensive than the guys you listed and took up an international spot in a position that you can find good quality keepers for cheap in MLS. He knocked us out of the playoffs last year and played a large part in digging us a whole this season.   That's not to say it's all his fault though, but still a much worse signing than any of those other guys."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,10,Thu Apr 9 15:47:30 2015 UTC,But who helped lead us to winning the IMG Suncoast Pro Classic?   Rais.   Checkmate.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"He looked great against the Red Bulls, added him to my fantasy team because of it lol."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,3,Thu Apr 9 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"Haha. That's true. I'm obviously making a ridiculous joke, but it's sad to think how promising I felt about him in preseason. That dumb title actually made me think what we saw of him late last year was behind us."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:01:06 2015 UTC,haha yea I got ya.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,xenoletum,0,Thu Apr 9 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"Rais had 4 apps in 2014. We didn't need to move MacMath at all for him, but did it anyway. He didn't knock us out of the playoffs, the team did that on their own accord, being unable to score and to finish a game. MacMath was responsible for the 9-11-10 record that he carried, with M'bolhi having a record of 1-1-2.  In fact, MacMath last year led us to a 3-7-5 start until the world cup break, which most of you will solely blame Hackworth for.  M'bolhi is the least of the teams problems, but it seems every year the team needs to have some sort of sacrificial lamb to quench the bloodthirst."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,Dean_Moriarty,7,Thu Apr 9 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"Rais had 4 apps in 2014. We didn't need to move MacMath at all for him, but did it anyway. He didn't knock us out of the playoffs, the team did that on their own accord, being unable to score and to finish a game.   Again, not saying Rais is the only one to blame, especially since he wasn't here for most of 2014.  But his only meaningful contribution was to botch a clearance to Earnshaw and sealing our fate in the process.   We did need to move MacMath, it would be dumb to have all of MacMath's, Blake's, and M'Bolhi's salary on the cap this year.  And nobody is saying MacMath was a world beater last year, but he was playing well enough that the team needed to spend the money on a striker and a defender.  Instead they spend a boat load of money to bring in a guy, and the absolute best you can say about him is that maybe he was the same quality as MacMath.   When you are talking about who the worst signing is you have to take in all the factors. Money, performance, need, what you had to give up or move around, all that.  I really don't see how anyone else comes close, Rais ticks all the boxes."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,KFCConspiracy,2,Thu Apr 9 16:13:16 2015 UTC,"Dude didn't save a single credible shot on goal that whole game, even among the ones that were disallowed that could easily have been saved. The only reason the score wasn't more embarrassing than it was, was the fact that the ref did his job half credibly for once."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,xenoletum,-1,Thu Apr 9 16:57:52 2015 UTC,But you're willing to look past all of his other credible saves all season and in the four games prior to spite him on one game with no credible saves. If we use this metric then the flyers would have fired every goalie they have on the team.
PhillyUnion,3209k8,xxtoejamfootballxx,9,Thu Apr 9 18:01:47 2015 UTC,Dude his save % has been like 50% since he got here
PhillyUnion,3209k8,goatyhead,4,Thu Apr 9 18:39:04 2015 UTC,"The flyers do fire every goalie, it's kind of their thing.  As a matter of fact I think there's a lot of similarities between the arc of M'Bolhi and the much maligned Ilya Bryzgalov."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,Guidosama,3,Thu Apr 9 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"Berry didn't 'not' want to be here, he was basically treated like garbage and told that he wasn't gonna play, but also simultaneously wasn't allowed to leave. So he was stuck here. A talk with the coach saying that they were going to give him a chance and let him play himself into contention probably would have been more than enough to make him happy."
PhillyUnion,3209k8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that he didn't get real playing time, but I wouldn't say Berry was being held against his will with the team. They were shopping him around and even had him tryout for the Cosmos, but no one wanted him. Maybe that's a direct result of his not having a chance to show his value because he didn't get minutes, but I don't think the team was just holding him for funsies either."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,DrewGo,9,Thu Apr 9 22:46:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the lack of an Okugo replacement is our biggest issue."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,LocksTheFox,3,Thu Apr 9 23:08:52 2015 UTC,"That, and a real LB and better wingers than out of position Le Toux and Wenger.   Add in some more defensive and attacking midfield depth and you've got a decent team."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,EdBacon,5,Thu Apr 9 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"I like Wenger on the wing, hes just not a striker and I think he plays more confidently on the wings."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,mthslhrookiecard,0,Fri Apr 10 01:25:45 2015 UTC,"He's better on the wing, yeah, but he's been pretty unimpressive so far this year. I don't really know what Wenger would be best at."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,EdBacon,3,Fri Apr 10 04:22:58 2015 UTC,Im not ready to condemn our offence yet this season
PhillyUnion,321yoe,mthslhrookiecard,0,Fri Apr 10 04:27:15 2015 UTC,Maybe it's time to push him further back and try out the Wenger Wing Back Experience? I might actually prefer that to Fabinho at this point.
PhillyUnion,321yoe,goatyhead,3,Fri Apr 10 12:49:00 2015 UTC,It's been discussed. At this point I see no reason not to try it while we wait for a real LB.
PhillyUnion,321yoe,EdBacon,3,Fri Apr 10 16:31:57 2015 UTC,For what we paid M'bolhi we could have had all those things and more. Plus we still would have pulled McCarthy and had Blake who is an international keeper.
PhillyUnion,321yoe,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:59:44 2015 UTC,Wenger on the wing is not out of position.
PhillyUnion,321yoe,Keepa1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"Well, it is. He was projected as a forward or CB. He just plays better on the wing."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:13:25 2015 UTC,So? It's his best position by far and I don't think he'll ever play Cb again. He might go up top but only in a pinch. The wing is his primary position and has been for quite some time.
PhillyUnion,321yoe,Keepa1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:59:37 2015 UTC,"Either way, he is still being played out of position. He wasn't a winger until Jim took over. However, he plays better out of position. In this case, there is nothing wrong with admitting it."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,FlapjackJackson,2,Fri Apr 10 14:13:33 2015 UTC,"I just don't see where the hang up is. If his best position is a new position, and he's been played there 100% of his starts this season, then that becomes his position. It's not OOP anymore except maybe for fantasy purposes."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,Keepa1,3,Fri Apr 10 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"We offered Okugo a contract I believe, he wanted out of the organization more than a big paycheck."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,drewuke,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:11:28 2015 UTC,Im sure there are things we could have done in order to keep him here beyond money.
PhillyUnion,321yoe,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:51:55 2015 UTC,Probably not willing to do anything. The organization still isn't willing to do anything and we're 20th out of 20.
PhillyUnion,321yoe,drewuke,2,Fri Apr 10 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"He's on record saying he didn't feel like we did enough to convince him to stay. I don't know what he's getting paid in Orlando, but I doubt it's that much. He also cited the chance to play with Kaka as a reason for choosing Orlando. So you may be right that money was not the primary issue. That being said, money talks, I'm sure if we had made him a better offer he would have been more likely to stay."
PhillyUnion,321yoe,drewuke,2,Fri Apr 10 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"We basically chose Edu over Okugo, and Okugo also chose OCSC over us. There's only certain things money could do in that situation."

I imagine he is the same way with his team and I imagine they like having him as coach.   Because of that, because I like him and want to see him with the time and resources to really make this team his own, I want to believe he was the singular voice and actor behind this move, but using this move as an indicator of his authority is predicated upon the belief that if Sak was opposed to it, Jim's vote would still trump all others. On the other hand, if Sak, even being instrumental in acquiring M'Bohli last year and considering him a good upgrade for the team has read the same writing on the wall over the last 5 weeks as everyone else and felt the same exact way as Curtin about what needed to be done, then Jim benching him isn't quite as symbolic or pregnant with meaning as it would otherwise be.  I think more time is needed before we really know who is in charge."

PhillyUnion,3212hg,Allthewaylive215,2,Thu Apr 9 19:19:37 2015 UTC,"yeah, agreed. it was a 2-pronged Q. I put maybe b/c while I 100% agree with benching him, ""sending him away"" seems a bit much. How is he gonna get to know his D better? Shouldn't he watch them play on Saturday?  Unless there is stuff going on we don't know about with his daughter/head, seems odd to ""send him away""--""letting him take care of personal issues"" would be ok"
PhillyUnion,3212hg,spqr-king,2,Thu Apr 9 22:41:31 2015 UTC,I think sending him away is dealing with personal issues. His family lives in France I believe from what he said so that could be weighing on him. I think sending him away and allowing him to clear his mind can only be a good thing for everyone.
PhillyUnion,3212hg,goatyhead,2,Fri Apr 10 03:57:30 2015 UTC,I'll defer to Curtin on the reasoning. I wouldn't send him away based on his poor play. I would for every other reason because M'Bolhi seems like the kind of guy that has a naturally volatile personality.   I don't think he likes the fact that he didn't waltz in here and half ass his way to glory. At least that's what his body language tells me. MLS is not EPL or La Liga but you still need to compete at your best unless you truly are a world beater.   In another thread I compared him to Bryzgalov for the Flyers but I think Bryz was much more likable but wholly misunderstood. A better comparison might be Roman Cechmanek for those of you old enough to remember that guy.
PhillyUnion,3212hg,Allthewaylive215,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"meh, i never got same sense of not caring from cechmanek. maybe Rais after World Cup vs. Germany is like Dom Brown after he had that ridiculous month with all the HRs.

PhillyUnion,3212hg,rabidfrodo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:36:27 2015 UTC,My only thought is Jim got the vibe from the team that removing Rais was better for the locker room in some way. I'm not sure having a big signing most guys might not be a fan of in the locker room in a big match for the team.

PhillyUnion,31vulp,dawkterglenn,14,Wed Apr 8 15:44:17 2015 UTC,Jim Curtin has named Philly boy John McCarthy the starter vs. NYCFC.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,steelcap77,5,Wed Apr 8 16:28:59 2015 UTC,My fucking boy. We got a little squad of our friends all going for his first start.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,bduff116,10,Wed Apr 8 17:23:14 2015 UTC,Apparently Rais went back to France: https://twitter.com/DaveZeitlin/status/585848424991428609  Not sure if he's coming back.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,EdBacon,5,Wed Apr 8 18:23:46 2015 UTC,The rare professional rage quit!  If this is true he has to thave the worst attitude I've seen.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,truckloadof4skin,10,Wed Apr 8 19:48:05 2015 UTC,"""This group sux!"" - Rais M'Bolhi"
PhillyUnion,31vulp,EdBacon,2,Wed Apr 8 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"Curtin told him to go home. Didn't rage quit, but then again who needs the little details."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,xenoletum,7,Thu Apr 9 15:43:45 2015 UTC,I will believe it when I hear it but hollllllly shit.  The drama.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Invol2ver,3,Wed Apr 8 15:54:46 2015 UTC,Seems like we're gonna find out at 12:30.  Hopefully this is the start of the Andre Blake era.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,tree-hugger,12,Wed Apr 8 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"Honest question: why do Philly fans seem to rate Blake so highly? He is 24, has no professional experience, and didn't look incredible in the occasional action he got last year.  In contrast, McCarthy is 22 and has a full season of pro experience for which he won an award as the best goalkeeper in the league. And he's from Philly. But everyone seems to want to see Blake instead. I don't get it, on paper McCarthy is a way better prospect."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Allthewaylive215,8,Wed Apr 8 17:19:51 2015 UTC,? Blake plays for his national team. That is seen as an indicator of talent.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,goatyhead,9,Wed Apr 8 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"The same could have been said, and was, about M'Bolhi."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Allthewaylive215,12,Wed Apr 8 17:40:39 2015 UTC,"yes, but the claim that McCarthy is a way better prospect on paper is not accurate... even knowing Jamaica is a smaller country with a smaller player pool.  people also want Blake to succeed b/c he was a top draft pick"
PhillyUnion,31vulp,mthslhrookiecard,3,Wed Apr 8 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's an indicator of what they're capable of, whether they deliver on that or not is up to them. Blake made some pretty great saves when he was on the field for us last year and although he made some inexperienced mistakes he definitely has the potential to be a very good keeper."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Allthewaylive215,2,Thu Apr 9 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"agreed, he looked the opposite of afraid. Rais looks afraid to make a mistake or take responsibility in the 6, Blake looked eager to swallow any ball near the 18"
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Mike81890,2,Thu Apr 9 22:30:26 2015 UTC,He has been pretty unimpressive for Jamaica at the senior level :(
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Allthewaylive215,2,Wed Apr 8 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"but is 24, and seems they think he is their future. i known macmath younger and all that, just saying his status as national keeper means something. and i know it hasn't meant much in Rais' case, but still an indication of talent, regardless of whether Rais is able to fulfill his promise in Philly."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,jpoRS,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"His national team is Jamaica. They're okay by CONCACAF standards, but we can't pretend that's high praise."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Allthewaylive215,2,Thu Apr 9 14:57:48 2015 UTC,"they've been good in the past, and it seems countries with larger GDPs per capita have caught up to those with perhaps more talent per capita on the pitch.  see this forbes article   and this ranking of GPD per capita, which shows Jamaica is 117 in the world...   so yes, Jamaica is not best soccer team in the world, but that doesn't mean they haven't been better in the past or that Blake might take them there again.  In conclusion, Usain Bolt should play CF."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,FlapjackJackson,6,Thu Apr 9 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"How is McCarthy a better prospect? Andre was the #1 pick and widely considered the best keeper coming out of college since Guzan. In contrast, McCarthy went undrafted.  The only reason Andre doesn't have pro experience is due to the GK clusterfuck. Andre may never live up to his potential,  but his potential is still higher.  Besides, being from the Philly area doesn't make him a good player."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,AdFinemFidelis,3,Wed Apr 8 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think people are invested in Blake because Philly sacrificed way too much to get him, so we want our money's worth. And the one time he did play he showed inherent talent, despite making mistakes due to lack of experience."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,LocksTheFox,3,Wed Apr 8 17:49:50 2015 UTC,I recall being impressed with his distribution.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,AdFinemFidelis,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"He almost had an assist from a perfect punt. And he had a few ""you can't coach that"" type of saves. He just made one of Houston's goals way too easy for them because he made the wrong decision."

PhillyUnion,31vulp,Mike81890,0,Thu Apr 9 00:52:34 2015 UTC,"Blake was the first overall pick that we traded an established starter to get. Its nice when we find a diamond in the rough, bur we want our big moves to pay off"
PhillyUnion,31vulp,rabmcmlxxxvii,2,Wed Apr 8 18:55:49 2015 UTC,Don't think he is match fit yet.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,rabidfrodo,6,Wed Apr 8 16:19:05 2015 UTC,So now we need to sell M'bohli not just loan him out.  Hope this is the start of Curtin fixing issues made by Sak and truly creating a legit team.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,niloroth,3,Wed Apr 8 17:05:28 2015 UTC,seems from the things Curtin is saying that he is just benched. No idea if that is just because they are not ready to make a more in depth statement until they clarify the details.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Too_many_hippos,3,Wed Apr 8 16:35:26 2015 UTC,Looks like he was just dropped to 3rd keeper. Holy shit.  https://twitter.com/SoccerByIves/status/585841660803870720
PhillyUnion,31vulp,spqr-king,2,Wed Apr 8 17:13:19 2015 UTC,How much money have we lost now... Bye bye $$$
PhillyUnion,31vulp,xenoletum,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:20:48 2015 UTC,M'bolhi wasn't being paid anywhere near big bucks. He wasn't even a DP meaning he was below 300k.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,spqr-king,4,Wed Apr 8 17:39:17 2015 UTC,300k is a ton of money when new players are making +/- 50k a year... Thats a new LB or other position of need and a decent one at that. We are going to have to pay him some kind of fee for early release.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Keepa1,3,Wed Apr 8 17:48:50 2015 UTC,I thought he is making 500K and is a DP.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,ohlooktwopigs,2,Wed Apr 8 23:48:05 2015 UTC,I believe that was last year due to fees...This year he is under the threshold for DP
PhillyUnion,31vulp,xenoletum,2,Thu Apr 9 11:57:29 2015 UTC,"He wasn't even a DP last year, we had to pay his transfer fee and his salary was ~235K last year. Everyone assumed he was a DP, myself included, but that turned out to not be the case."

PhillyUnion,31vulp,EdBacon,2,Wed Apr 8 17:41:00 2015 UTC,Gaddis was having words with him on Sunday during the game. If there's an antagonistic relationship between him and his backline then he needs to get sat down at the very least.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,mtommyboy,3,Wed Apr 8 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"I think this is the right move, but what a giant waste of money and time. Perfectly indicates that our FO has no clue what direction we want to go in and if it's true we could've used this money instead to buy someone for our midfield or something in the first place."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Mike81890,2,Wed Apr 8 16:43:30 2015 UTC,If he's in Europe and isn't coming back I'd guess it's  a mutually terminated contract. That would be amazing.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,LocksTheFox,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"I don't wat to go too crazy with theories right now, but if they can sell/trade M'Bolhi that would free up a DP spot and a bunch of money.  With the summer transfer window coming soon and a couple big names possibly on their way to MLS maybe we can turn this into a huge positive.  I know our front office doesn't want to spend, but I can dream can't I?"
PhillyUnion,31vulp,xenoletum,5,Wed Apr 8 17:01:59 2015 UTC,Rais isn't a DP
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Mike81890,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"Edu, Maidana, and Aristigueita. M'bolhi was sub 300k. And I think we just paid off Maidana's transfer fee so he's no longer a DP either. So we have one spot open."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,LocksTheFox,3,Wed Apr 8 17:40:43 2015 UTC,And Aristegueta is a young DP so I think there's even less cap hit
PhillyUnion,31vulp,IPv6_and_BASS,2,Wed Apr 8 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Maidana isn't one anymore.  Any good holding mids we can snag on a DP deal so we can move Edu to CB without worrying about the holding mid sucking?"
PhillyUnion,31vulp,xenoletum,2,Wed Apr 8 17:43:41 2015 UTC,Still frees up the cash though.  Essien has been rumored to be keen on an MLS move.  Not sure we could afford him though.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,mtommyboy,2,Wed Apr 8 17:49:09 2015 UTC,I could die of happiness just at the thought of Essien here.

PhillyUnion,31vulp,EdBacon,-5,Wed Apr 8 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"The narratives of ""BUT THE FRONT OFFICE"" and ""BUT THE REFS"" have grown old and tired. The front office isn't responsible for the two losses, the front office isn't responsible for M'bolhi falling out of his preseason form, the front office isn't responsible for Maidana's injury, Pfeffer's suspension, or Williams' injury. It's been a rough start after a poor finish last season but christ there are 29 games left."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,ricker2005,6,Wed Apr 8 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"The F.O. is responsible for signing MBolhi. They are responsible for not signing depth to get us through these injuries. Instead, they spent a pile of money on Rais instead of a LB, DM, or attacking depth who could have gotten us through this stretch. They chose to resign Fred who got in the slapfight.  I don't know how anyone can defend this F.O. anymore."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,xenoletum,5,Wed Apr 8 19:42:32 2015 UTC,They resigned Fred because it puts a member of the technical staff on the player's payroll to be covered under the salary cap. It's like they wrote the book on being cheap.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,TaeKurmulti,4,Wed Apr 8 21:23:16 2015 UTC,"The front office is 100% responsible for everything M'bolhi related.  The guy was has never been able to hold down a position at any club before.  He's spent the last 10 seasons as a nomad playing for 10 different clubs, including in leagues worse than MLS.  Seriously he's falled to stick in France, Scotland, Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, Japan, and now the US.  And on the flip side, he played well for Algeria a few times.  The Union weighed a tournament or two more heavily than the entire rest of this guy's career.    M'bolhi didn't mysteriously fall out form when the season started.  This is his form."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,xenoletum,-4,Wed Apr 8 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"I, too, can recycle talking points from his signing.  He looked great in the RSL game, which we only tied due to a bad foul call. Tough luck. The rest of the night he was pretty spot on with saves throughout and the ones that went by him were good balls.  The FC Dallas game was where he started to slip mentally, and it's been downhill since. He needs to cool his mind off and the team needs to invest in a sports psychologist to clear players heads after hard losses, or else they're going to keep blaming themselves.  The front office isn't responsible for  his saves that he has made, his saves that he hasn't made, or any mental blocks. But whatever, it seems that this isn't the Philadelphia Union sub, but the ""fuck the union"" sub."
PhillyUnion,31vulp,ricker2005,5,Wed Apr 8 19:39:08 2015 UTC,Nick is this you?  There's no way someone else would say it's not the front offices fault for this cluster fuck.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,LocksTheFox,0,Wed Apr 8 21:01:16 2015 UTC,How about we stop focusing on Nick and start thinking that MAYBE CHRIS ALBRIGHT ISN'T THE BEST TECHNICAL DIRECTOR.
PhillyUnion,31vulp,Dean_Moriarty,4,Thu Apr 9 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"The front office is responsible for picking up a player who isn't good at his position.  We know he's not good at his position because he's never been a long term starter for any team in any league for a decade.  When the front office pulls the shit they did with picking up M'bolhi in the middle of the season, then they are responsible for whatever comes of that signing whether it's good or bad.  And it's been bad.    So no, it's not the ""fuck the Union"" sub.  It's the ""fuck the Union front office because they've been fucking terrible"" sub."

Look at players that WERE on the Union in a where-are-they-now piece  Michael Orozco is a regular for the US National team, Chris Seitz is a starter for FCD, Mondragon played in the freakin world cup with Carlos Valdes, Jacobson was a fixture at FCD, McInerney and Mapp are starters at Montreal, Jordan Harvey was a fixture at Vancouver for a while.   I'm Sure there are more, and I'm not saying keeping any of them at the time would have led to better things (for them or the team), but its kind of nuts how much talent we let walk away."
PhillyUnion,31vm4f,Mike81890,9,Wed Apr 8 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"ehh let's not get too carried away here.  I'm sure you could make a similar list of ex-players for any team   Lopez was terrible here, so nothing lost there Mondragon wanted to go home and play with his old team before retiring, what were we gonna say no? Mapp (and Ribeiro) were lost in expansion drafts.  I suppose you could say we suck at protecting people, but it's not like we cut these guys Valdes... Do you really want to talk about him? Soumare was not great here, and was not great for Chicago either.  He's been bouncing around for a few years, let's not act like he's an all star Jack.  I suppose you could miss him, but striker is not really a position of need for us at all.  I'd say we're actually better off after the trade. Not buying Orozco was probably a mistake.  Would certainly be an asset to our thin back line, but calling him a National Team regular might be a bit much.  He has 13 appearances over 7 years. Seitz... I don't want to talk about Goalies right now"
PhillyUnion,31vm4f,Luzzi15,3,Wed Apr 8 15:30:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that you can spin a lot of these situations positive or negative, but how about Jacobson over Carroll? Orozco- how many of his performances have been in the past couple of years though? Klinnsman seems to like him for low-pressure friendlies.  I'm not willing to excuse expansion drafts when we execute them so poorly. I get that you have to let people go, but keeping very limited players because we have no other answer (Fabinho) and then letting players with promise (Ribeiro) go is horrible. We could have gone out and bought an LB. In fact we probably should have.  Jack... ok it was a boondoggle, Faryd... ok extenuating circumstances... idk. I just feel like this team has been pretty flipping awful with acquisitions."

PhillyUnion,31vh7x,EdBacon,9,Wed Apr 8 14:02:46 2015 UTC,Unless the whole of the supporters groups gets together it wont change anything. This is why its so shitty that the supporter group is so intertwined with the FO.
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,spqr-king,4,Wed Apr 8 14:37:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's true, but it won't hurt anybody to try. Not like it can get any worse, haha."
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,drewuke,4,Wed Apr 8 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"This is being put together by the Bearfight Brigade.  I know you think the SoB are just extensions of the FO some other conspiracy theorist bullshit. But the Bearfight Brigade is not the SoB and definitely not ""intertwined with the FO""."
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,rabmcmlxxxvii,5,Wed Apr 8 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Thats why I said the whole of supporters groups. Meaning all of them including the largest and most well known which is SoB. Dont get me wrong Bearfight Brigade is cool and I have no issue with them despite your rather prickly response but SoB is for sure with the FO. Without the largest portion of supporters we will look broken and disorganized as fans like what NYRB's did with their last ""protest"". We need a unified and loud response to what is going on not a disjointed protest put on by a smaller segment of fans."
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,spqr-king,2,Wed Apr 8 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"Give previous experiences, the FO notices any protest. And even think actions of one person warrants concern.  They will take notice."
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,rabmcmlxxxvii,2,Wed Apr 8 16:50:02 2015 UTC,Well if this shit happens another season I say we empty the rivers end for a game. That would be huge considering its the heart of PPL still have people go to the game but no one sitting there would be huge.
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,spqr-king,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"I would honestly get some facts before blabbering about SoBs being in bed with the FO.

If you can show me some facts on how you think we're in bed with the FO, please, enlighten me, than we'll talk."
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,Husher315,2,Fri Apr 10 02:50:47 2015 UTC,I think I was vague and the focal point of what I said was missed. Intertwined the FO and SOB work together in some capacity yes? Im not saying they are in bed I never said that. I dont think they exchange cash in dark alleys but I do think they regularly organize and work together which if they showed major dissent would be much harder to do. My main point was without everyones support the black out wont work as well as it could.
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:07:20 2015 UTC,"Open letter about refereeing, but no comment on all the decisions that the Fo has made that has damaged the play.

PhillyUnion,31vh7x,spqr-king,2,Fri Apr 10 04:09:18 2015 UTC,Also it's more than just wearing black.  They are planning a full boycott of concessions and merch.
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,rabmcmlxxxvii,9,Wed Apr 8 16:27:16 2015 UTC,Not very smart considering the stadium is sponsored by PPL.
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,drewuke,4,Wed Apr 8 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"I am fine with wearing black, but the only thing that will change anything is a buyer with a big checkbook.    Josh Harris is local and close to buying Crystal Palace.  Maybe after that he looks into buying the  U?    I think what Man City has done will become more common.  The ability to share scouting, marketing opportunities, and other common infrastructure components makes a lot of sense."
PhillyUnion,31vh7x,DoubleHappyDave,3,Wed Apr 8 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"The checkbook isn't the issue. The wisdom of the purchases are the problem. We have spent big money in the past (whether on transfer fees and/or salaries) on failures such as:   Freddy Adu Bakary Soumare Gabriel Gomez Josue Martinez Roger Torres Carlos Valdes Rais MBolhi   The issue here is lack of foresight and planning. Some, like Roger, were not well liked by the manager. Some, like Gomez, did not fit the manager's plans. The Union just sign whatever name pops up without sitting and thinking about how they fit the team.  Keep in mind, Nogueira was signed to be a 10 for this team. Maidana was meant to be a winger. Edu was supposed to be a box-to-box midfielder. Luckily, we found a way to fit them all in. Regardless, none of them play where they were signed to.  The issue here is idiotic incompetence on the part of the F.O. when it comes to long-term planning. We seriously need someone here who can run this team intelligently. Maybe that is a GM. Most likely, it will be new ownership. Either way, money isn't the issue. Competence is.  Oh, and for the record, Roger Torres is my favorite Union player ever, and I blame Hackworth refusing to play him for his failure here."

PhillyUnion,31xtsp,ignoramis,0,Thu Apr 9 13:00:59 2015 UTC,What does that mean?
PhillyUnion,31xtsp,KFCConspiracy,3,Thu Apr 9 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in. What are we doing? I'm a season ticket holder in 138. Bags?   Although honestly with M'Bolhi benched, it seems like they're starting to do more to listen."
PhillyUnion,31xtsp,rabmcmlxxxvii,4,Thu Apr 9 01:33:11 2015 UTC,I think it's a good sign that Curtin has more control of the team decisions.
PhillyUnion,31xtsp,ignoramis,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:08:58 2015 UTC,They were forced to bench mbolhi cause of the attention nationwide and it was clear they as stupid as the union is they would at least do that but that is not enough
PhillyUnion,31xtsp,KFCConspiracy,-1,Thu Apr 9 14:49:18 2015 UTC,That is BS. They aren't listening to the fans and nor should they. They know way more about their players/ how to run a franchise than the fans do. They made that decision based off of performance.
PhillyUnion,31xtsp,ignoramis,0,Thu Apr 9 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"What I'm getting at isn't necessarily listen on all of the player acquisitions, strategy, etc, but listen to the fact that the fans are tired of what isn't even good enough to be called mediocrity. I don't want the fans micromanaging the team, but when the fans say the product on the field is unacceptable you don't keep putting the same product on the field, claiming to be great you listen."
PhillyUnion,31xtsp,KFCConspiracy,0,Thu Apr 9 16:19:31 2015 UTC,But what if the product on the field needs time to jell and develope? By screening and throwing a fits all that does is make organizations look for bandaids rather than long term solutions.
PhillyUnion,31xtsp,ignoramis,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:28:06 2015 UTC,Same excuse every year for 5 years. Which front office intern are you? But most importantly: does the communications department know that one of their interns is racist   You don't have to be racist to say racist things.   We gave Hackworth his season and a half to get it right with no complaints before the booing started. He failed. Now they gave us Hackworth 2.0. They promote from within because they're cheap bastards and many fans are sick of it.

PhillyUnion,31vfbl,bduff116,3,Wed Apr 8 15:44:55 2015 UTC,Meh.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,Dean_Moriarty,32,Tue Apr 7 19:02:29 2015 UTC,Bless Curtin for having the guts to do this
PhillyUnion,31s42n,LocksTheFox,7,Tue Apr 7 19:11:13 2015 UTC,It also means Sak is possibly further out of the picture than I thought. At least in regards to player management which is a good thing.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Tue Apr 7 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"Sak can't say ""no don't bench him"" after how he's been playing. There would be more outrage than there already is."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,PhilaDOOPia,6,Tue Apr 7 20:04:02 2015 UTC,Sak could. The man forced the signing then forced him starting. If you think Curtin wanted to bench Zac in the stretch run last year you are pretty naive.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,rabidfrodo,3,Tue Apr 7 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"The general consensus, if I recall, was ""We have a world cup keeper and you're still playing MacMath"" the entire time, and then the Chicago game happened, and people suddenly forgot about all the losses MacMath has handed us.   Like the disappointing stoppage time tie in the opening game against Portland last season.   e: this almost belongs in /r/conspiracy with the people who were saying that the MLS was intentionally taking the MLSPU walkout threat on us because our name has ""Union"" in it."

PhillyUnion,31s42n,LocksTheFox,9,Tue Apr 7 19:31:10 2015 UTC,"I really want him to work out, I think he could do really well in this league and in the few interviews I've seen with him I think Philly as a city would be a good fit for him culturally. But with his recent performance I'm beginning to wonder if his nomadic career throughout Europe wasn't as innocent as it looked."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,jpoRS,7,Tue Apr 7 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"I know he's said that he wants to be here and is committed to playing in Philly, but his body language and the fact that he won't talk to the media says otherwise."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,dekelly,3,Tue Apr 7 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not reading too much into not talking to the media. What's he going to say ""yeah I fucked up""?"
PhillyUnion,31s42n,jpoRS,4,Tue Apr 7 21:05:26 2015 UTC,"Well... yeah. At least admitting he makes mistakes and he wants to improve would go a long way to improving his relationship with the fanbase. Right now he just seems like he either doesn't want to be here, or doesn't care"

PhillyUnion,31s42n,--smokeandmirrors--,5,Tue Apr 7 19:23:48 2015 UTC,Great news.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,rabmcmlxxxvii,5,Tue Apr 7 19:07:20 2015 UTC,So McCarthy starts?
PhillyUnion,31s42n,bterre108,3,Tue Apr 7 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"Most likely, yeah. I think I saw someone on twitter say that Blake just recently got back to practicing, can't find the tweet right now though so maybe I'm wrong.  But even if he did just start practicing again, probably unlikely he's ready to start."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,10phillyphan,5,Tue Apr 7 19:18:43 2015 UTC,about halfway through this article it also says Blake has been practicing in full
PhillyUnion,31s42n,NovaNardis,5,Tue Apr 7 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"Give a lot of credit to Curtain. Takes balls to do that. Let's see how it plays off.  But the question is... Does McCarthy start? Andre is injured, correct?"
PhillyUnion,31s42n,10phillyphan,8,Tue Apr 7 19:15:57 2015 UTC,It's a bold move Cotton.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,LocksTheFox,7,Tue Apr 7 20:01:16 2015 UTC,Let's see if it'll pay off
PhillyUnion,31s42n,10phillyphan,2,Tue Apr 7 20:05:42 2015 UTC,Blake is practicing
PhillyUnion,31s42n,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:22:40 2015 UTC,Yes I saw that. Just wondering if he is definitely full health
PhillyUnion,31s42n,10phillyphan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"Takes balls to do that   At this point you can't really worse than M'Bolhi. This weekend we have another game we're widely expected to lose. Last weekend we had a game we were expected to lose, were winning at the end, and then lost in the last minutes in large part because of our goalie. So the worst that can happen is we lose a game that we were going to lose anyway. I'd say it's just the rational choice no matter who's in net."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,kav138,2,Wed Apr 8 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"Oh it is completely rational, however, it's hard to bench your highest paid player with the highest expectations."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,EdBacon,5,Wed Apr 8 15:03:54 2015 UTC,Sak will end up taking credit for this if whoever starts Saturday performs well.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,thelostdolphin,3,Tue Apr 7 19:35:32 2015 UTC,"This means Curtin isn't beholden to Sak's personnel decisions. Last year we were told that Nick would no longer be involved with personnel or roster moves, and this seems to speak for it. It's a step forward, even if its a small step."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,rabidfrodo,5,Tue Apr 7 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but that's assuming Sak didn't want to sit M'Bohli out too for the next game."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,EdBacon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:29:36 2015 UTC,Sak might be more stubborn than anything ever created. I doubt he'd admit that he was wrong. Probably try and take credit for the benching.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,rabidfrodo,2,Tue Apr 7 23:23:37 2015 UTC,While reiterating the fact that he has nothing to do with personnel decisions I'm sure.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,Luzzi15,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:43:23 2015 UTC,Yep he also has nothing to do with the fact that the team is dirt poor.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,grubber788,3,Tue Apr 7 23:44:53 2015 UTC,"This is gonna be a long season between the pipes.  Even if Blake or McCarthy light it up, we've got a lot of money just sitting on that bench doing nothing.  Add on the unclear MacMath situation possibly going into next year, and we'd possibly have 4 goalies..."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,Paeregrine,8,Tue Apr 7 21:09:23 2015 UTC,I thought MacMath's contract expires after this year's loan? I really like MacMath but I'd never come back to Philly if I were in his shoes. You learn not to touch the stove after a while.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,Keepa1,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:30:05 2015 UTC,I really like MacMath. I hope he comes back because he's really no worse than M'Bolhi's been playing and (I feel) MacMath is improving. I think he could become a really great GK if given practice and an FO that puts faith in him.  That all said: I'm not sure I'd want to come back if I were him.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,Too_many_hippos,7,Wed Apr 8 02:32:06 2015 UTC,"The fact that this is even necessary, the fact that we as fans are asking for it... Our FO is wearing a big dunce cap, and DC and NY are wearing tshirts that say ""I'm with stupid"". They're so inadequate and it's truly embarrassing to see it play out like this. It was one thing to go and spend on the one position we didn't need, but after everything, the fucker ends up BENCHED?? Could not be a worse situation."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,KFCConspiracy,2,Tue Apr 7 20:25:33 2015 UTC,Good to hear. We need to change something in our game and while this might not make us winners I think we need to try it out.   Who do you think is going to start? I would assume Blake.
PhillyUnion,31s42n,MacGooder,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"It may be too early for them to start Blake. Although Blake has been practicing, he's only been practicing as of yesterday; so less than a week's worth of practice before the game."
PhillyUnion,31s42n,dawkterglenn,2,Wed Apr 8 12:57:36 2015 UTC,It's kinda sad that M'Bohli rhymes with goalie. Ironic

PhillyUnion,31qwes,spqr-king,12,Tue Apr 7 13:43:31 2015 UTC,"Hire a hitman to take care of Sak Hire experienced execs at GM and Technical Director Sign a holding mid to allow Mo to play at CB Hire a sports psychologist for M'Bolhi and anyone else with confidence issues Get an actual LB. Ashe, Sinovic, Harvey, just someone. (I've also proposed bringing in Liassine Cadamuro in the past; he's a teammate of M'Bolhi's on the national team, so maybe he could help him out, plus he can play anywhere in the back line.) Pave lot A ffs DRILLS ON MARKING ON SET PIECES. FOREVER."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,LocksTheFox,8,Tue Apr 7 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"Firing the coach is an awful idea. We always try that and it doesn't work. Give Curtin time and just let him and the team work this out. We're an awful dreadful team at the moment but it can't get worse, so there's no reason not to let Maidana, Pfeffer, and co. come back from injury and try and play their way out of this funk.  Aristeguita looks great, Edu and Vitoria are a beastly center back combination, and once Nogs and Maidana are back in midfield we'll hopefully get a win and try and get some momentum.  I hope my positive post doesn't take too much away though that despite all of this we are a joke club and Rais Mbolhi is the biggest scandal to hit the city of Philadelphia."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,Guidosama,2,Tue Apr 7 14:19:09 2015 UTC,That last point is a huge one I feel like Blake may be the better option of the two as he has growing potential and Rais is supposed to be in his prime but is failing to make any impact or run the box.
PhillyUnion,31qwes,m4nu,3,Tue Apr 7 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"Weakest point: The lack of technical staff. We simply do not have enough, especially if our long term focus is on the academy. We need to have the best back end staff in the league if we want to pull that off. Look at what SKC did. Hell, we could probably keep Curtin as head coach - just give him more support!  Ownership needs to trust ther manager or find someone they can though. There shouldn't be ""unbenchable"" players.  On the field: not much to fix actually. Attack is good by MLS standards as is midfield. Over the summer, if be happy with two signings:    an average starting left back. Doesn't need to be a god. Ashe would be good. Keep fabinho and Williams as depth. a starting caliber CDM to let Edu stay in CB. Doesn't need to be flashy. Should be an anchor and allow the rest of our - very good - midfield work their magic around him. Good at distribution/free kicks as a too creative/technical player might just cause the midfield to get Clogged. Keep Lahoud/Carroll as depth bring up Marquez to challenge white. Keep ayuk in our 18 as opposed to Hoppenot. Recall Cruz. Keep Pfeffer as support for Maidana. start Blake ASAP."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,LocksTheFox,2,Tue Apr 7 14:25:22 2015 UTC,"You know who else would be good, who lost his starting spot?  The last actual LB we had: Jordan Harvey. (Vancouver's been rolling with Adekugbe lately)"
PhillyUnion,31qwes,goatyhead,5,Tue Apr 7 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"Actual soccer related stuff:   Have a heart to heart with Edu about playing CB permanently.  Sit M'Bolhi for a game to get his head straight.  Switch to a 2 striker formation for a bit Trade one of Williams or Gaddis for a starting LB, I'd prefer Williams going  (Seth Sinovic = good, Cory Ashe = ok, either >>>> Fabi)   Business stuff:   Hire a GM Hire a Technical Director and move Albright to assistant coach  Hire permanent operations staff, interns should be just that. PAVE LOT A ALREADY.   I would also probably fire Sak because rightly or wrongly he's an increasingly toxic character for this club. And I would argue his history reflects the same."

Find a way to get M'Bolhi's contract off the books, or at least off our cap hit.   Move Le Toux to the bench Then if there was any time left or space on the cap sign a pacey winger or second striker."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,WildGooseCarolinian,2,Tue Apr 7 14:48:22 2015 UTC,I am really curious to see how long it takes for them to admit M'bolhi was a mistake if he keeps performing like this.
PhillyUnion,31qwes,WildGooseCarolinian,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"They never will.  No way they'll admit splashing that kind of cash on a player who failed to deliver even marginal quality was a mistake.  It's too big a fuckup to take the hit on.  Closest we may get is trading him or taking a hit and getting rid of him with the terms of the trade ""undisclosed according to league rules"" with them saying they got made the right offer."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,akuller,2,Tue Apr 7 19:03:56 2015 UTC,Union coach confirms they Wille bench M'bolhi lol
PhillyUnion,31qwes,thelostdolphin,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"Benching him isn't Sak ""admitting he made a mistake.""  Curtain has never liked him. As poorly as he's played, it's hard to see how anyone could protest benching him.  Will Sak ever admit it was a mistake? I still don't think so.  And it looks like what I said about they'll just dump him for a loss and hide the contract is even more likely after the press conference today."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Apr 9 03:35:10 2015 UTC,Ill take it as the closest thing to an admission of guilt we will ever get. Benching him then letting him go to France for an extended time is pretty much saying we are parting ways plus he was their largest offseason signing after all the hoopla Sak made about that little tournament he will never openly admit his mistake but its clear he had a huge part in this and Curtain is cleaning it up.
PhillyUnion,31qwes,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 10:47:07 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with that. It was a stupid signing from the beginning. I don't care if he ever admits his mistake, as long as someone fixes it, and it looks like curtin is trying to clean it up."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:47:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I feel everyone is underrating the work Le Toux is putting in on defense and off the ball. He is all over the pitch making plays and covering holes his teammates leave. He has not been at his best on the offensive end but I feel that has a lot to do with the extra work he is being forced to do. Benching him would most likely make the U look like much worse of a team.
PhillyUnion,31qwes,thelostdolphin,2,Tue Apr 7 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"Replace Sak.  Have a fire sale on our bench players and unload Fred, Carroll, fabinho, Hoppenot, all of them. Even if it's a short-term financial hit, I'd take the money made from those moves and buy some genuinely serviceable backups and supplement the empty spaces that exceed my bench player budget with the handful of promising young guys in Harrisburg who seem ready for first team minutes.  In terms of our starting XI, my first instinct would be to keep as much of that core group intact as possible considering how few minutes they've had to play together and build chemistry.  I'd stick with Curtin, but have a long, honest conversation about where he feels he needs to improve and what resources he feels would best help him in that capacity, whether that's additional staff or different staff members or whatever. I'd also ask him for the names of one or two guys from the starting XI who he feels the least confident in and who are least worth his efforts as a coach and then work on finding viable upgrades to those couple spots while reassuring the rest of the team that I have no intention of rocking the boat or blowing everything up.   I feel fairly confident, based on Curtin's responses to questions by the press, that Rais would be high on that list. Given the amount of money tied up in him and the difficulty in finding a suitable buyer, I'd at least temporarily replace him with Blake (assuming he's healthy and ready to go).  Blake may not be the answer, he may very well not be as great a talent as Rais, but for whatever he lacks, the potential positive relationship building and improvement in communication between keeper and the defenders would be worth rolling that dice for me. I think the second to top guy on Curtin's list would be Ethan White and he would likely be mine. I don't see him having much higher of a ceiling and I think investing in a better central defender is money well spent.   Lastly, I would pressure Bimbo and Dogfish Head into giving me free samples of English muffins and beer and consume them all day long like a disgusting pig."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,xenoletum,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:03:35 2015 UTC,I feel like we have a handful of young talent we dont utilize in place of those washed up/barely mediocre players you mentioned.
PhillyUnion,31qwes,xenoletum,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"I think we do too. It's just hard to know when is the best time to bring young, potentially good guys up to the first team with fewer minutes and some initial knocks to their confidence as they try and adjust to a higher level of play vs giving them starting minutes on a lower level, allowing them to grow as players, and build their confidence up higher before graduating them to a new role.   If we didn't have all the ridiculous injuries and disciplinary issues that we've had, I would guess the plan was to give Catic and Ayuk and the other guys a couple months in Harrisburg to really get into form and then test the waters with them in the rotation as needed. The issue now is, is it worth deviating from that plan to address our short term issues or is it better to deal with less than ideal backups and not panic while the starters gradually get back to the team even if that means taking a hit in early season points."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,JoeBenzon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:19:34 2015 UTC,Well its working out great with Ayuk IMO he has played fairly well.
PhillyUnion,31qwes,goatyhead,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I just don't know how many others are ready for that same transition. Guess you can't know till you try. The issue is, is it worth the risk or better to go with what you know. I'd say what we know (in terms of our bench), is mostly worth forgetting."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,saltedmeatsps,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:30:08 2015 UTC,Honestly I would say investing the play time in the new players who are unproven is better then wasting it on players who are proven to be bad? It will be a harsh transition for sure but it can give them early experience that will be of great use when they do transition from the bench/reserves.
PhillyUnion,31qwes,rabidfrodo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"I agree. I just think some are more likely to benefit from that move (and for the team to benefit) than others. I really want to see Catic, though the level of play he's used to is pretty low. I love the guy's attitude and confidence though, so I'm looking forward to that whenever it happens.   I'm curious why McLaughlin keeps getting overlooked. Makes me think no one is particularly thrilled by his potential, but maybe it's something else at play."
PhillyUnion,31qwes,OshiHidra,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:41:04 2015 UTC,Im sure they are seeing how these players practice and getting an idea of their potential but its just that practice and drills. Ayuk should be starting in my mind he has played well enough. Im not sure about the others. Pfeffer should start as well he made a huge mistake but thats no reason he shouldnt get the start now that he isnt suspended.

Can Lahoud play well enough at CDM to allow Edu to move back and allow Nogueira/Maidana/Whoever to get forward in the attack?  I'm not sure, but if every is healthy, I think it's something we need to try."
PhillyUnion,31mvzu,EdBacon,3,Mon Apr 6 15:29:09 2015 UTC,Well what are your options? You want Edu at CB that means you need to pair somebody else with Nogs since he doesn't play well isolated. If Lahoud plays conservative I think it could work. The aspect I liked is that Nogs had trouble linking up with Edu since he would float around the field. If Nogs knows where Lahoud is going to be at all times it might make it easier for him to collect the ball and find an outlet when under pressure.
PhillyUnion,31mvzu,JawsJVH,7,Mon Apr 6 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"I thought Lahoud was solid yesterday. Played simple, short, 1/2 passes. I'd rather have Edu at CB and Lahoud at CDM than White at CB and Edu at CDM. Especially because I think Lahoud would complement Noguiera more than Edu would."

Missing Noguiera, Maidan, Pfeffer and Fred and having to drop Edu to CB meant they really didn't have anyone in the midfield to drive the offense. It's hard to imagine them getting much possession. They knew they would be beat by Sporting if they both tried to play a possession heavy game, so they ceded possession and decided to play the game on the counter. So possession numbers just aren't as relevant in a game like this. Look at any game where a team is up late, possession in the last 30 minutes is always lopsided. If the defense holds up just a little bit better, if Fabinho doesn't get injured and force us to bring in the lowest pick from this years draft to see the field this season, if Le Toux doesn't hit the post, or if Lahoud puts in a sitter this is a statement win, the strategy worked amazingly, and Curtin is a savior for getting 3 road points against a good SKC team with half his bench starting. Of course those things don't happen and it is a heartbreaking loss, but that doesn't mean Curtin would have been better off trying to play for possession all game."
PhillyUnion,31mis8,bmangan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:16:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I mean, I agree with you it was in the strategy, and I agree that it was the right strategy, but the execution was so far off. There needs to be a minimum of possession and movement to prevent chances of the opposing team. The U conceded virtually all the possession and allowed SKC to pepper their box. Even a blind squirrel will find a nut and eventually one of those chances results in a goal. It's just not realistic to concede 70% of the time on the ball and expect results. Those are Gibraltar vs Germany numbers.   Like I said, I agree with the tactic given the situation, but taken to that extreme its bound to eventually fail."
PhillyUnion,31mis8,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 6 20:00:13 2015 UTC,"You're right. It definitely wasn't executed perfectly but its not the lack of posession that makes it an issue. I'm not saying this is a perfect example, but it's the first one I thought of. When Atletico played Real in January of this year in the second leg of the Copa Del Rey, posession was 63-37 to Real, but the game ended tied and obviously Atletico had won the first game which made a difference, but they also had scored early and subsequently went deep early which has a huge effect on possesion in the second half of the game, even more dramatic of course because it's he second leg and Real knows that there's no use in a tie.  Obviously we don't have the players have the defenders that Atletico has, but it can be a successful strategy and if you're employing that strategy it's not super useful to look at posession numbers."
PhillyUnion,31mis8,bmangan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"No, I understand that. The problem is that when possession is so wildly skewed that it becomes detrimental. The Union weren't just sitting deep and absorbing pressure. They were setting up a shooting gallery for SKC.   We'd need real depth at holding midfield and our backline to make something like that work."
PhillyUnion,31mis8,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 6 21:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yea I just don't think there was a better way for them to play this game. Curtin did the best he could with the strategy, and for the strategy he chose posession stats are a very poor indicator of success. The real problem from my point of view is just how bad we are defensively on set pieces and the fact that Besler turned any throw inside our defensive third into a set piece. We did well enough from the run of play, not great for sure, but good enough to pick up points but set pieces destroyed everything. The defense is bad at set pieces, MBohli is bad at set pieces, and Kansas City knew it and took good advantage of it."
PhillyUnion,31mis8,bmangan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"That's not positive!  But really, it felt like they were in possession more and giving the ball away less, and as possession is just a calculation of passes completed, maybe we had possession for longer, just not making passes (I know Ayuk and Aristeguieta both had some nice individual forays)?"
PhillyUnion,31mis8,EdBacon,3,Mon Apr 6 14:14:21 2015 UTC,Reals don't matter. Only feels.
PhillyUnion,31mis8,LocksTheFox,10,Mon Apr 6 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"Fernando is a BAMF. Him and Gaddis give 100% every week and I love them for it. Ayuk looks legit, how the hell'd we find him? He's pretty damn good, would like to see him pass more though Edu-Vitoria at CB = yes pls. A vintage Brian Carroll performance. Fabinho looked competent for once."

PhillyUnion,31mis8,Timothy-H,2,Mon Apr 6 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"Le Toux wasn't the worst up front IMO. If he'd of finished off that chance after the Aristeguieta 50 yard run (or if Lahoud didn't sky the rebound), we'd be talking about a whole different game."
PhillyUnion,31mis8,Too_many_hippos,2,Mon Apr 6 14:26:48 2015 UTC,Um.. We have a majority of our would-be-starters out on injury or some other unfortunate problem. So really this team is being played with mostly subs and subs of subs and not our best.
PhillyUnion,31mis8,cjd5286,2,Mon Apr 6 14:44:46 2015 UTC,None.
PhillyUnion,31mis8,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you pretty much nailed the positives (except for the possession lol).   Ayuk looks legit Edu needs to be CB I thought I was going to hate how we played when I saw the lineup.  Le Toux up top, with an empty bucket with a hole in it with Carroll and Lahoud.  But I thought we actually played really well, including Le Toux, Carroll, and Lahoud.     Quick aside, we had 30% of possession and only completed 53% of our passes.  Part of that is playing against SKC and part of that is the guys we put out there.  So it ""worked"" well for this game, but shouldn't be something we try to model our long term strategy after I don't think.  You don't know what you got till it's gone -Fabinho  Another solid game from Gaddis Aristegueita is a player and always a threat around goal when the ball is coming in. Return of Sapong! And he looks badass, if he can get it going that will be a big help."

PhillyUnion,31mgms,kmpmcd,2,Mon Apr 6 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is really Curtin's fault. Remember what he did for us last season?  It still ended in failure but it was a great turnaround.   The real problem as we have all said is the FO. Sack needs to be taken care of and we need to let the FO know that this kind of management is inexcusable. I'm all for playing money ball but money ball means getting results with the way you spend your money.   So far our money spending has gotten us a disappointing GK who we spent way too much money on and not much else really.   We really need a change, that's it."
PhillyUnion,31mgms,Too_many_hippos,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Blake is still recovering from surgery our only other option at goal Is McCarthy. But throw him out there, he can't be much worse than mbohli at this point. And right now until maidana and pfeffer are back there is not a propper cm you can play with with Fernando. The team is a mess, I don't understand why Curtin put in Lee over white. I would have rather taken my chance with white at rb than someone unproven. And that petke comment is intriguing. Put every real union fan knows this team won't be truly competitive until sak is gone."
PhillyUnion,31mgms,kyleisgreattt,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:14:55 2015 UTC,Because Lee's the most suitable LB replacement we had. Which is sad.  Especially given SKC subbed off their LB and it may have actually improved (from de Jong to Sinovic)

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,drewuke,32,Mon Apr 6 01:10:50 2015 UTC,Fuck it.  Going positive...   1) Ayuk seemed decent.  2) We scored a real goal.  It wasn't an own goal.  It wasn't a foul throw.  It wasn't a bad pass back.  It wasn't a gift.  We scored a damn goal.  That's all I can come up with.  Any others?
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,MortalSmurph,27,Mon Apr 6 01:18:32 2015 UTC,Gaddis remains consistently good as does Nando.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,spqr-king,12,Mon Apr 6 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"I knew I forgot a big one.  I used to be a Gaddis hater.  Damn, he has turned that around.  I love Gaddis now.  I wish we had a few more Ray Gaddis."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,MortalSmurph,3,Mon Apr 6 01:28:55 2015 UTC,I see that as a huge bonus for Curtain as well keeping him on board when we knew we would lose Okugo is a huge deal.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,spqr-king,7,Mon Apr 6 02:28:14 2015 UTC,"We really, really miss Okugo."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:35:14 2015 UTC,Desperately. I feel like if players want to leave and cant see the potential in a team it is a clear mark of bad management. There are plenty of people on our roster who could have gone to make room for him to make more money and bring in new players so he could feel like we were going to do something moving forward.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:11:24 2015 UTC,I wished we had a team just of Gaddis's. God damn that'd be awesome.  It'd be interesting to watch him play center mid.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,JoeWearsSocks,12,Mon Apr 6 19:38:34 2015 UTC,We won't see Lee on the field again. Thats gotta be a positive.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,truckloadof4skin,0,Mon Apr 6 01:22:08 2015 UTC,Really? We haven't seen nearly enough of him to condemn him this early.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,6,Mon Apr 6 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"Nor should we see more of him. He doesn't belong on the gameday roster at all. The kid should be playing at Harrisburg or in some development league before he's ready for prime time. It's a sad joke that we had to scrape that low for bench options that our choices were either the 71st pick in the draft, or a guy with an ankle injury."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,7,Mon Apr 6 02:12:16 2015 UTC,What qualifies you to say that? Have you seen him play before he came to the union? I haven't. I've seen him play a handful of forgetful preseason minutes and then tonight. The own goal is unfortunate but it doesn't define him. Who cares if he was 73rd draft pick. That doesn't define him either. I'm not going to judge anyone on the roster until I see them play multiple times. There's a reason Curtin had him here so i want to see what he's got. I'm not saying start him (although heat I the moment I did say that in the match thread) but don't write him off so quickly.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,2,Mon Apr 6 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, why do we need to see him play in a regular MLS match first? Much less risky to both the team and the individual player to assess them in a different setting first, build them up, then introduce them to a regular game. Throwing a kid like that to the wolves immediately is rarely a good idea. Not saying Lee isn't talented, just that its not a good idea to put him into the lineup like that just yet."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 6 11:58:57 2015 UTC,Hopefully that OG doesnt ruin him for a while because he has potential he is just so young.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,spqr-king,7,Mon Apr 6 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"As it looks now, Ayuk is everything I've ever wanted Cruz to be."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,marble617,10,Mon Apr 6 04:04:56 2015 UTC,Great work ethic but wayyyyyyyyy more technical ability
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,7,Mon Apr 6 04:34:22 2015 UTC,Edu made our defense not look like complete shit. If it weren't for set piece defending we would have been OK.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Tohaba,5,Mon Apr 6 01:30:35 2015 UTC,We had the lead for 90 minutes??
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,ctg1014,2,Mon Apr 6 01:23:20 2015 UTC,This doesn't feel positive...
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,grubber788,3,Mon Apr 6 01:24:11 2015 UTC,It feels familiar...
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,spqr-king,3,Mon Apr 6 02:29:08 2015 UTC,I agree that ayuk was a pleasant surprise. If he can learn when to take a man on and when to release the ball he will be very dangerous out wide for us.

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,xxtoejamfootballxx,2,Mon Apr 6 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"Well, nobody wanted to pick him up for half price or free. I don't think MLS FOs rate him tbh"
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"plenty of people would have wanted him for free or half price, but nobody wanted him for one season.  They also saw that we needed to unload him and completely destroyed his trade value.  That has more to do with terrible management than his on-field ability.  He's better than a great deal of starters right now and I'd be surprised if he wasn't making close to $200,000 and starting next season."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,xxtoejamfootballxx,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:48:13 2015 UTC,"We could've unloaded him when we drafted Blake, but nobody wanted him  Outside of Rais, what starters is he really better than?  IMO, Rais didn't cause a goalkeeper problem, he failed to solve one."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,8,Mon Apr 6 16:56:20 2015 UTC,You keep saying Clint Irwin like he's bad. He's not bad. And he has more history with Colorado than MacMath. It's justified.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,8,Mon Apr 6 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"Statistically, he was MLS's worst starting keeper last season. Worst in GAA, second worst in save percentage (Tally Hall was worst).  Even Pablo saw how bad his season was and thus begat the  Joe Nasco  Experiment"
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,5,Mon Apr 6 01:31:04 2015 UTC,I know. It really doesn't mean anything to me. The entire team last year was statistically the worst in the league. Hard to blame the keeper in that situation.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:34:50 2015 UTC,Macmath is also a loan and not a guarantee for the future and usually loans have some sort of performance clause for $ so it's not just about how he plays.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,mthslhrookiecard,3,Mon Apr 6 02:09:35 2015 UTC,to be quite honest I'd rather Colorado buy him because we'd get their #1 SuperDraft pick this year. Two top 5 picks would be greaaaaat
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:11:44 2015 UTC,Yea but there is also a huge age difference Rais is supposed to be in his prime... MacMath is just 23.

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,atypicalclothespin,3,Mon Apr 6 01:41:36 2015 UTC,Zac's organization was one of the main (justified) complaints against him. He did not have command or show any real leadership until after M'Bolhi was signed.

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,xxtoejamfootballxx,7,Mon Apr 6 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he's gonna be Sak's fall guy in all this like Hack before him.   Until the ownership group sells to somebody who could give a damn this is going to become the norm.   Think TFC before they started to spend a lot of money."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:17:02 2015 UTC,"Calling Hack ""the fall guy"" is a little misleading.  He was a terrible, terrible manager.  Just because Nick Sak is the root of the problem, doesn't mean Hack deserved to be kept on."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,xxtoejamfootballxx,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"I agree, Hack wasn't a good coach, but it was Nick's decision making that put him in that situation. When the results didn't materialize Hack was shown the door, but we'll never see Nick say he made a mistake as well."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think we're on the same page.  It's pretty obvious that Sak is the problem, as he has been with every club he's run.  Unfortunately he wasn't an owner for any of those clubs."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 6 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't think he's the right option at all, but if he goes it's just going to be even worse. Let's drop him at the end of the season when we can focus on getting a real coach and and give him time to figure out the squad."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:36:45 2015 UTC,Getting a real coach he says! That's a good one!
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Mon Apr 6 12:27:07 2015 UTC,I'm taking bets for Albright as our next coach.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,6,Mon Apr 6 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"I don't want to call for Curtin's head. I want to call for Sak and Sugs heads.   Curtin is too young and inexperienced. He should've stayed as an assistant to learn, but we all know how cheap the organization is so they got the perfect fall guy for super cheap and are going to ruin him."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,bduff116,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:44:29 2015 UTC,Agreed
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,TomCosella,2,Mon Apr 6 04:06:17 2015 UTC,"And then at the end of the season we will go on an international manager search, just to keep Albright."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,magnumbbrown,4,Mon Apr 6 02:04:12 2015 UTC,"You forgot to put quotes around ""international manager search"" because i have serious doubts that we've ever actually followed through on those."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,grubber788,3,Mon Apr 6 02:14:39 2015 UTC,They meant to say interimnational manager search....it was gonna be Curtin all the time.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,truckloadof4skin,10,Mon Apr 6 15:50:26 2015 UTC,Who are we tanking for anyway?
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,atypicalclothespin,7,Mon Apr 6 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"Well i never thought i would say this but, its a shame that Fabinho got hurt.  Lee is no where near ready to be playing.    Also FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!"
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Dean_Moriarty,6,Mon Apr 6 01:12:28 2015 UTC,I don't know why white wasn't brought in instead especially considering how physical the game was and he's pretty good in the air.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,thelostdolphin,9,Mon Apr 6 01:23:28 2015 UTC,Never thought I'd say this but we missed Fabinho down the stretch.  Lee's man scored both goals.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Apr 6 01:15:38 2015 UTC,"It's just as painful to completely agree, but when I took a step back and realized we were using the replacement of a replacement we normally cringe even considering using, I realized we were opening ourselves up to problems."

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,11,Mon Apr 6 04:41:58 2015 UTC,We haven't won a real game in 8 months.  8 MONTHS.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,9,Mon Apr 6 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"This might be a stretch, but I honestly feel like M'Bolhi is worse than the 2010 iteration of Chris Seitz.   At least Seitz seemed to give a damn."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,--smokeandmirrors--,8,Mon Apr 6 01:36:00 2015 UTC,And he later became a pretty decent keeper
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,jerseyroller,8,Mon Apr 6 06:47:55 2015 UTC,i want off Nick Sak and Jay Sugs wild ride :(
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,17,Mon Apr 6 01:44:49 2015 UTC,"remember when nick sak talked down on us about criticising the mbolhi signing? ahh, the good ol days."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,TropangTexter,9,Mon Apr 6 01:24:50 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? Nick Sak has nothing to do with player signings.   Nothing to see here folks! Move along!

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Keepa1,8,Mon Apr 6 05:10:04 2015 UTC,I'm numb
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,drayb3,3,Mon Apr 6 01:11:52 2015 UTC,Same. I called a union loss when we were up 2-1 in the 30th. Not surprising at all.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,cjd5286,9,Mon Apr 6 01:30:11 2015 UTC,"This team is fucking trash. I love the Union, but dear god this is just sad. Lahoud sucks, M'Bolhi can fucking go back to Algeria or wherever. Anywhere but here."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,JawsJVH,10,Mon Apr 6 01:13:05 2015 UTC,"Other than missing that sitter that would have sealed the game, Lahoud played well. Blame should be focused elsewhere (namely MBolhi, Lee, Sak for signing Mbolhi...)"
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,bmangan,3,Mon Apr 6 02:00:08 2015 UTC,Agreed. Lahoud worked his butt off. He played well. Le Toux should bury it in the first place.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Tohaba,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:30:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He hasn't scored a goal in years, and while he absolutely should have scored that one, he still had a very good game. If he was the only backup that has to start in a game I'm totally confident in him. I don't want him starting, but as an injury replacement, or to allow Mo to move around more freely or drop in at CB he's a solid player and he's showed it this past few games."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,jpoRS,7,Mon Apr 6 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"I hate that we are the laughing stock of MLS, but I can't even say we don't deserve it. We did the whole promote the interim coach thing, and haven't won a game in 11 matches going back to last season."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,10,Mon Apr 6 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"I said in the pre-match thread that the score doesn't matter. What matters is how the team plays. And honestly, there is a lot to feel positive about. Curtin seems to have found a form that minimizes the liabilities of Lahoud and Fabinho, and Carroll gave us the one good game he is capable of every year. Edu needs to man up and accept his roll as CB, and we should all learn how to spell and say ""Aristeguieta"", because this guy is awesome. Ayuk was amazing and I really look forward to seeing what he looks like when he's ready for full time. Lee also looked competent in an area we desperately need depth.  But then there is Rais M'Bolhi. I've been a vocal defender of his for a while now, but I can't do it anymore. He never was the leader our back line needed, and his only redeeming quality was shot stopping which seems to have left him as well.  And beyond that, enough with the stoppage time collapses already. I can only take so much."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,11,Mon Apr 6 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"That's where a solid keeper should really shine, when you're up by a slim margin and need to see a result out under pressure. M'Bolhi can't organize his defense and can't confidently defend his box. Besides a few instances where he shows really good reflexes at shot-stopping, he's otherwise been consistently shaky under pressure.   I know people like to hate on Fabinho, and he's got a lot of liabilities on defense, but tonight's weakest link in the back really looked like Rais. He was just immobile and flat footed the whole game."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,4,Mon Apr 6 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"M'Bolhi can't organize his defense and can't confidently defend his box   Same with MacMath, which is why I'd  rather see Blake or McCarthy replace Rais than Zac."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,4,Mon Apr 6 01:55:31 2015 UTC,I think MacMath seriously tried and was making progress. But at this point its academic. Get Blake in there and see what he can do.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,3,Mon Apr 6 02:01:27 2015 UTC,He only made progress once someone got signed to take his job
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Apr 6 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"I think year over year he got better, not just after Blake arrived. But like I said, its academic: MacMath is gone and now you have to see what Blake can do."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"I've been a big Rais defender but I agree with Blake. Who knows, maybe having his job threatened will light a fire under Rais's ass"
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Apr 6 02:06:31 2015 UTC,Sure hasn't so far. His body language gets worse each game.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,truckloadof4skin,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:09:08 2015 UTC,His confidence has to be shot right now
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,jpoRS,4,Mon Apr 6 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"Lee was responsible for the second and third goal. He looked less competent than fabinho and that is about the worst insult i can give a left back.  I agree with the edu point, He needs to be one of our starting center backs hes a heads above White."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,2,Mon Apr 6 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice him on those goals, which now that you mention it isn't a good thing."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,mrcm1392,2,Mon Apr 6 01:41:05 2015 UTC,Lee's not a natural LB (he played mid in college) and it showed
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,ctg1014,7,Mon Apr 6 01:55:52 2015 UTC,Something major has to change. It's really difficult to support this team when they are the laughingstock of the league.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,rabidfrodo,6,Mon Apr 6 01:16:06 2015 UTC,"Let's send delco fc out for the next game, might show some heart for a change...."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,cee_smooth,18,Mon Apr 6 01:17:45 2015 UTC,Said it before I'll say it again M'Bolhi isn't a good keeper. He has cost us more points than most players. #BlakeIn
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,dragonjock27,8,Mon Apr 6 01:19:17 2015 UTC,WHAT A COLLAPSE. WOW
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,--smokeandmirrors--,6,Mon Apr 6 01:13:12 2015 UTC,"Some friends and I bought a 5-game plan last week. Starting to think it may have been a bad decision. If Philly isn't going to play any form of professional soccer, why should we pay to see it?"
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Apr 6 02:05:22 2015 UTC,"Just don't buy anything at the concessions, try not to pay for parking if you can help it."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,MrChips217,4,Mon Apr 6 03:47:10 2015 UTC,I also have to add this:  Brian Carroll was not half bad tonight
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Too_many_hippos,5,Mon Apr 6 02:20:59 2015 UTC,Man...I really can't even...
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,cmills1,3,Mon Apr 6 01:16:54 2015 UTC,Sometimes it's just too much 😢😩  Union please.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,4-1-3-2,9,Mon Apr 6 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly: I kind of expected to lose this game. And yet: we looked pretty damn decent for 90% of this game. Everyone was playing their hearts out (with the exception of M'bolhi but I'll get to that), and I finally saw what Curtin meant about being bastards: not throwing the elbows to the face, but being the guys who just will not leave you alone. Fernando in particular was all over their back line, and it created chances. And we held a lead for, what, 90 minutes? In a game no one expected anything of us, missing like 1/3 of our starters? Fucking Carroll and Lahoud in the midfield?   And then, in garbage time, it's M'bolhi giving up two goals. I've never been a huge hater, and I was willing to give him a chance, but goddammit. He doesn't look like he gives a shit out there, and it sure as hell doesn't look like he has any chemistry with the back line -- especially with Gaddis yelling at him earlier in this game. Yes, we definitely lost momentum at the end, but those weren't unsaveable goals for a goalie who can get in position and be a leader at the back. And at this point, I don't trust him to do either of those things.   The bad news is: we come out with zero points, and in heartbreaking fashion.   The good news is: what a game. The fact that it was a heartbreaker says something. This is a team that, win or lose, I want to watch. I want to watch that ginger phenomenon Aristeguieta make other teams look stupid. I want to see Ayuk get better. I want Gaddis to get the recognition he deserves for being consistently great.   This team is working hard, and it's unfair to give up on them just yet. #AdFinemFidelis, not in that sarcastic SoB ""always look on the bright side of life"" kind of way, but earnestly -- I mean it. And I hope some of you guys are in it with me."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,10,Mon Apr 6 01:29:35 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the sentiment, but I can't get on board there, mate. Not even in a non-SOB, earnest kind of way.   It's a sub-par product for all the investment fans like you and I have put into this club. Plain and simple. I can and do support - I always will, but we deserve more.   Maybe next season. Just like we said last season. And the season before that.  Regardless, I'll be happy if we can turn this around. However, it'll be mostly dumb-luck if we do - winning is not a priority, or the primary drive, for this FO."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,cmills1,3,Mon Apr 6 02:04:54 2015 UTC,if I had waited one more year to become a MLS fan I'd be a Montreal Impact fan.  D'oh.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,4-1-3-2,2,Mon Apr 6 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree that we deserve more, and that the FO's priorities are out of whack.   I just like this group of guys, and Curtin, and hate to see them thrown under the bus for FO mistakes. Should half of the guys that were on the field tonight have even been in the 18? Probably not, but we have zero depth. Should Curtin be the manager? Probably not, but given the situation he was thrown into and the options he has, I think he has done a decent job (and, with a couple more years of experience, would be a GREAT fit for this club and this city)."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,toxicroach,2,Mon Apr 6 04:56:37 2015 UTC,"Agree all around there. The manager and players aren't doing well right now, but you're right that they are trying. They aren't the problem.  The problem is the club. The cancer will not leave with any amount of fight or determination.   The club does not give a damn about winning as long as we are given just enough hope to keep handing over the cash."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,InCraZPen,2,Mon Apr 6 05:47:08 2015 UTC,"I watched the Fire game last week, and I thought this would be a total pushover.  You guys play like you did against SKC every week you'll get off the bottom real fast.  May or may not make the playoffs, but you'll start winning.  Though yeah, new goalie would be good.    I kind of think I could saved the Anibaba goal.  Seemed like he was scared of hitting people and waited too long on that one."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Wh3resTh3Beef,3,Mon Apr 6 15:15:45 2015 UTC,"Its hard to get angry and such, but I guess I have to.  We played fine.  We should have won.  We just need to learn how to finish a damn game.  Get a psychologist in the locker or something."
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,B4kstabr,6,Mon Apr 6 01:14:40 2015 UTC,I cannot wait to see the Tifo next week.  Good god.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,akuller,5,Mon Apr 6 01:18:15 2015 UTC,This feels worse because of the chance that LeToux and Lahoud both  botched....WOuld have been nice if for the 5th game in a row we had a proper fucking foul called for our guys getting dragged down in the box.  I mean the ref is RIGHT fucking there staring at Aristigueta getting yanked and NOTHING?
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,oooooooounbelievable,5,Mon Apr 6 01:21:07 2015 UTC,Le Toux put it on fram Lahoud's miss was unacceptable.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,truckloadof4skin,3,Mon Apr 6 01:33:12 2015 UTC,while it should have been a card (most likely yellow) he did give the advantage and we missed two shots. no complaints about the ref there
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,InCraZPen,6,Mon Apr 6 02:39:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I was more upset about fernando getting assaulted with no call. Then i was about Lahoud missing he hasn't scored in like 4 years.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,B4kstabr,5,Mon Apr 6 01:24:28 2015 UTC,That definitely was a foul.  Not sure how it wasn't called.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,gregzorian,4,Mon Apr 6 01:23:00 2015 UTC,The worst part is I would have been perfectly fine with a free kick top of the box...It was close but I am just angrier because NOTHING...not even an advantage call....granted this ref on both sides of the ball again just was inconsistent and wtf worthy.

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,CosmikHippo,5,Mon Apr 6 01:11:49 2015 UTC,On who? We don't have starters let alone subs.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Tohaba,6,Mon Apr 6 01:12:36 2015 UTC,I don't care.  He could have used the sub to kill some of the momentum that SKC was building in stoppage time.  Just put somebody in so they can't get a quick throw or a quick goal.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,jpoRS,6,Mon Apr 6 01:15:07 2015 UTC,Nogueira was still on the bench no? And McLaughlin could have been used.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,LocksTheFox,5,Mon Apr 6 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"McLaughlin was just there to make 18, he played a full 90 for HCI on Wednesday(?). Nog has a bad ankle, better to let him heal so he's top form for the NY2 double header."

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Tohaba,2,Mon Apr 6 01:25:11 2015 UTC,Good thing I wasn't saying he should have started. You bring him on to kill the game. Three defenders and one striker is more likely to let us hold onto a lead than two defenders and two strikers.

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,Cheddar229,2,Mon Apr 6 01:16:01 2015 UTC,I don't think this is a team that benefits from the strategy of parking the bus. Why give the opposing team so much possession even if scoring is harder with more defenders in front of them? It just creates more and more and more opportunities for what happened to occur. I think we should stick with what we were doing the rest of the game. We don't have a reliable backline to lean on and I think we play better defense when our defense has an offensive mentality.
PhillyUnion,31ktv1,B4kstabr,2,Mon Apr 6 01:36:32 2015 UTC,"It was a gritty performance, I'll give them credit for that.  But we simply didn't have the talent to compete with them tonight.

PhillyUnion,31ktv1,bduff116,0,Mon Apr 6 02:20:19 2015 UTC,"You can be the hardest working player on the team all you want, but if you continually waist possession and stall the offence over the course of multiple matches your arse should be grow familiar with the bench. Sit him down and put someone else in to either outshine him or give him motivation to get his head bloody straight. Sadly enough due to ruddy injuries we don't have that sort of luxury. Trading Jack Mcinerney for him was the first step towards the pitfall we're finding ourselves in now."

There was a sharp, positive change in the attitude of the players from last week, which comes from good leadership. At least we didn't get thoroughly outplayed and shut out by a large margin, which was a real, foreseeable possibility. Given all the injuries and suspensions, hats off to the guys who played for putting up a good fight and lasting that long. It'll surely just leave them more eager to finish the job next week."

PhillyUnion,31liw6,drewuke,7,Mon Apr 6 05:42:04 2015 UTC,SoB should organize a no show. River End empty at a home game will be conspicuous as fuck. Wait for one of the nationally televised games.
PhillyUnion,31liw6,m4nu,10,Mon Apr 6 08:46:17 2015 UTC,SoB leadership won't let this happen. You might be able to organize a protest with the SoB rank and file but the leadership is firmly in bed with the FO. Dissent is not allowed. Prepare to have your banners removed and have obscenities yelled at you by a capo if you do.
PhillyUnion,31liw6,EdBacon,6,Mon Apr 6 12:04:21 2015 UTC,"I know, that's why I don't like the SoB, tbh. But it'd be something"
PhillyUnion,31liw6,m4nu,4,Mon Apr 6 12:12:58 2015 UTC,Word on BigSoccer seems like a lot of people would go along with a protest. The idea is just what you could get away with.
PhillyUnion,31liw6,EdBacon,6,Mon Apr 6 12:18:29 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Literally got told as much last night.  The Sons of Ben exist to support the Union and they will not be involved in any actions against the front office or ownership. Horribly frustrating, given that they are the group that has real power to be heard.  And yeah, the Sak tifo last year was not their doing."
PhillyUnion,31liw6,tonyny,6,Mon Apr 6 12:32:47 2015 UTC,"This is why I hate the idea of being ""supporters"" and supporters culture in general.  I've heard many people respond to negative chants by saying something along the lines of, ""we are supporters, we need to support the Union no matter what.""   That just seems so dumb and mindless.  I'm not a supporter, I'm a fan.  I'll praise when they deserve it and I'll criticize when they deserve it. I'm not just going to mindlessly support something if I think they can do better."

An organized no-show is unlikely. Maybe everyone could just sit down for 5 minutes instead of standing and singing.   I'd rather see negative Tifo than a no show.... Or just singing random queen songs again. And regardless the SOB organization won't get behind anything like that in any official capacity. It's just not in the character of the organization."

PhillyUnion,31l3kd,AtcRomans116,19,Mon Apr 6 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"The team is run half assed. From the parking lots to the skeleton crew of a technical staff and the bargain bin coaches there's a consistent lack of any serious investment in building a winning franchise. When they do decide to spend money its on an attention grabbing ""flashy"" name who doesn't pan out because the Union has no system to work them into, and no way to develop talent even if they had a coherent style of play.  To top it all off, the guy who masterminds these personnel moves, who is there for all the photo ops and interviews, passes the buck and vehemently denies ever being involved when the whole thing goes south. Now you've got a cancer on your gameday roster, costing your results, and sucking up cap space which is stretching the whole team thin across the field. When an injury pops up, the entire lineup feels it because there's no depth left on the team. Young players are sold or burned out, either playing without experience or sitting because there's simply no plan or ability to coach them into future starters.   The whole thing is run like a second thought by guys who like to pretend they can manage a sports team, or pretend to ""Moneyball"" wheel and deal to put together a competitive roster. When it doesn't work out, they look for excuses or point the blame elsewhere. When the results on the field reflect the poor management, fans are told to be happy with what they have, because we could have nothing to watch at all.  If Sack and Co. weren't running this organization into the ground, I'm confident they would be involved in pushing high-risk mortgages, or laundering money, or something equally as sleazy. If there is anything we as fans can do to force a change we need to do it. We've been demanding more for years now. Demanding more from an ownership group that wouldn't even be here if not for the support of fans who came together for a team that didn't even exist yet."
PhillyUnion,31l3kd,EdBacon,10,Mon Apr 6 02:51:34 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.   The ownership made their intentions clear in the very beginning. This is purely a moneymaking venture, loud and clear.   1) They put the stadium in Chester, not in the City of Philadelphia (they did not want to actually spend money to build a stadium in the city, put it in the Chester for the cheap)   2) Got the taxpayers to foot the bill for the stadium.   3) Try and not pay Chester their taxes.   They are trying to spend the least amount of money possible. This is purely a business for them. $$  Just adding to everything you're saying /u/EdBacon . Totally and completely agree with you!"
PhillyUnion,31l3kd,JawsJVH,3,Mon Apr 6 03:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, yup, and yup.   Winning isn't important to this club."

Also, M'Bohli's attitude and leadership is far below what he should be demonstrating and I'm growing tired of thinking it will change. I hope Blake rehabs quickly and Sak's pride doesn't get in the way of giving him a chance over a guy that is increasingly revealing himself as a bust."
PhillyUnion,31kvz2,thelostdolphin,2,Mon Apr 6 03:07:53 2015 UTC,Did Lee look bad? I honestly didn't feel like I noticed any costly mistakes. Not saying he looked great out there or anything though
PhillyUnion,31kvz2,thelostdolphin,8,Mon Apr 6 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely dismal positioning during set pieces. It cost us a goal.   I feel bad for him. It's a terrible time to throw an unseasoned guy into the mix, so I'm not going to define him as a player based on this situation but he still played a significant role in our injury time collapse."
PhillyUnion,31kvz2,Keepa1,4,Mon Apr 6 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I wasn't looking that closely. yeah I dont think I would fault him. I really think we need to create U2, and not rely on harrisburg to grow our players.

PhillyUnion,31kvz2,Keepa1,-6,Mon Apr 6 04:32:47 2015 UTC,"What an oddly bitchy, passive aggressive of way of stating that you see things differently."
PhillyUnion,31kvz2,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:33:52 2015 UTC,i'm saying it's not his positioning that cost us. that's obvious. i don't know what happened on the play so i'm not about to go trash talking him when i don't know what happened. please tell me how i can be less passive aggressive when talking on an internet forum.

PhillyUnion,31kiiw,drsilentg,5,Sun Apr 5 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"We've so thoroughly alienated the guy that I highly doubt he would ever play for us again. And even if he did, I can't see him trying too hard. First we tried to shake it up with Oka, then the he got booed, fans talked about him badly, then we drafted Blake, then we brought in M'Bolhi; and before the ink was even dry on the contract started talking about M'Bolhi as the future. MacMath hates the Union for good reasons. I feel bad for the guy, and I wish we had him right now, but I don't want him back because I want him to do right for himself."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,KFCConspiracy,6,Mon Apr 6 13:55:43 2015 UTC,Considering Rais and how much we are paying him this could be the biggest mistake the Union have ever gone through with. I keep thinking maybe he will come around and be the world cup keeper I have seen on television but he constantly disappoints. Our defense as a whole is an embarrassment even with Edu as CB and Gaddis playing his ass off we cant keep a lead to save our lives.
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,spqr-king,4,Mon Apr 6 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"Freddy Adu would like to have a word with you.  M'Bolhi won't be that World Cup keeper we want because he never was that. Look at his club record. He's bounced around smaller leagues his entire career, and that has to tell you something. Getting to make a bunch of reaction saves in a ""heroic"" 1-0 loss to Germany is not the same as confidently commanding your backline and owning your box to see out 2-1 leads consistently."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,EdBacon,3,Mon Apr 6 01:54:12 2015 UTC,"M'Bolhi is a strange breed. Quality for country, but awful for club."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,4,Mon Apr 6 02:25:08 2015 UTC,He wouldn't be the first though. Can think of several players who made a big impression on the international stage but never made it at the club level.
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,EdBacon,3,Mon Apr 6 02:37:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he is, I'm just saying it's so odd how someone can be good for his national team but awful for his club."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,2,Mon Apr 6 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get it either. Maybe he thinks this is below him?"
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"I have no clue.   I've been tossing around a thought, what if we brought in one of his mates from the national team? Liassane Cadamuro was the first that came to my mind, he can play all 3 defender positions, and he plays in the second division (he's teammates with that Cedrick bloke that Crew signed) in Spain so it's not that much of a leap or dropoff.   Rais's best friend, from what I've been told, is Foued Kadir, but he's a #10 and I don't know if we'd want him coming off the bench with Pfeff and Chaco already there"
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,2,Mon Apr 6 02:59:50 2015 UTC,"Is he left footed? Honestly if Edu drops back to CB what we really need is defensive depth, we have MLS quality starters there already. Right now, M'Bolhi isn't working out. Changing our backline to make him feel more comfortable seems like the wrong direction to go in. Better to find a more flexible keeper with a better attitude imo."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,EdBacon,2,Mon Apr 6 03:03:55 2015 UTC,"He is!   EDIT: Also, he played youth for Sochaux from 2003-2008...Vincent Nogueira started in 2007. Wonder if they know each other?"
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,2,Mon Apr 6 03:05:59 2015 UTC,"I've been an Adu hater from the start, but at least he had some great plays and had a few goals/assists. M'Bolhi hasn't really kept us in a game or won us a game."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,brain_smart,2,Mon Apr 6 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'll agree there. He had flashes of brilliance. But in terms of sheer money thrown away on a bad investment, he's got to be up there."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,EdBacon,6,Mon Apr 6 02:00:25 2015 UTC,"WOW M'Bolhi IS TERRIBLE! Just WOW, what a collapse."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,cee_smooth,6,Mon Apr 6 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"Zack had his faults but he was getting better.   Regardless, Curtin needs to have the balls to drop Mbolhi for Blake. Let him know that performance was not good enough on his part. He cost us that game."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,4-1-3-2,2,Mon Apr 6 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that Sak brought him in and Sak ultimately has more say than Curtin about whether he remains and continues to start. If you listen to Jim's weekly interviews and press conferences, it's abundantly clear that he's not happy with Rais but it's beyond his level of command.   Zac wasn't the answer. He had next to no leadership qualities despite being a decent MLS caliber young keeper. I think Blake has the right combo of talent and mentality / communication skills to become the on field leader of the defense we've been lacking for several seasons."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,thelostdolphin,6,Mon Apr 6 02:41:53 2015 UTC,Why do people think Macmath is good? Were we watching the same matches?

PhillyUnion,31kiiw,SirMothy,6,Mon Apr 6 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"He was pretty good for us especially considering our defense, he's also young and will only improve. Rais is the polar opposite of that. I'd rather have zac as our pretty decent keeper than rais."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,mthslhrookiecard,2,Mon Apr 6 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"He was decent, but M'bolhi is like 5 notches down from decent."

Yes, but as bad as MacMath was, M'Bolhi somehow makes even worse decisions than MacMath and is even less skilled at basic soccer plays like clearing the damn ball. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AW4y_4nlI  We all know in this situation you see 2 guys coming towards you, very light support in your back field, you boot that fucking ball as hard as you can, and that's the end of it.

PhillyUnion,31kiiw,Soccerdweebz,2,Mon Apr 6 01:12:06 2015 UTC,I wasn't impressed the end of last season when M'bohli cost of those two points. After the beginning of this season I know he has to go. I would be a better keeper than him.
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,Keepa1,4,Mon Apr 6 01:20:10 2015 UTC,No we can't. It's a season loan. But you know he's sitting at his apartment in Denver right now chuckling to himself and saying the exact same thing we are.
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,0,Mon Apr 6 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"No. If we yank Rais, put Blake in.   MacMath was unable to unseat last year's worst starting keeper in MLS. He is not good."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,grubber788,3,Mon Apr 6 00:06:27 2015 UTC,Colorado sucks in general too though. Maybe they don't want up unsettle any of their existing leadership on the backline?
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,2,Mon Apr 6 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"What existing leadership? Of their back four who opened the season, NONE of them were on the team last year. (Burling was with Chivas, Harrington with Portland, Riley with LA, and Sjoberg was still in college).  O'Neill and Burch are the only healthy (Drew Moor is hurt) defenders they have right now that were on the team last year."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,grubber788,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:28:19 2015 UTC,I guess that's what I mean. Any incumbent keeper is bound to present a challenge for an incoming young guy like MacMath trying to swoop in and take over. I reckon having a completely new defense is one more incentive to retain your existing keeper than to start 100% fresh. But I don't know. How hard is it to displace a keeper without any in-team playing time to back it up?
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,KFCConspiracy,2,Mon Apr 6 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"Well, we're making stupid goalie choices right now too... Who's to say Colorado's coach isn't just as fucking moronic."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"Irwin started this year with 3 clean sheets, so I'd say yes, he is better than MacMath...  Also, MacMath did the same exact thing against KC in the preseason (2 quick goals to turn a win into less)...only it was a win to a tie and didn't come in stoppage time. Rapids were up 2-0, then he gave up goals in the 77th and 78th minutes. Make that a 2-2 draw, good for the final result."
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,akuller,2,Mon Apr 6 16:14:28 2015 UTC,MacMath is younger than blake.
PhillyUnion,31kiiw,LocksTheFox,0,Mon Apr 6 01:38:08 2015 UTC,"Does a one year difference really matter?

PhillyUnion,31kvj6,thanksbastards,2,Mon Apr 6 01:46:59 2015 UTC,Lee got burned showed that he'd only been on for a bit and that he was young. The marking can be fixed especially if the keeper decided to command his box abd take some pressure upon himself.

I'd of put Wenger there or LeHoud before going with Lee.   Is Marquez > Lee? If so, why was he playing for Harrisburg?   Playing Lee there was ridiculous.

I think we can right the ship this season faster than last once our squad is healthy. The one big big issue for me though is M'Bohli. Not because everything tonight was his fault but that he's not a good teammate or leader to his back line and despite whatever talent he has on the international stage, it hasn't shown itself on the modest stage of MLS. I don't think Zac was the guy either. Our best hope is Blake once he's healthy,IMO"

Plus the Union always play SKC well, even when we're having a bad year. And if Sapong is somehow back in the lineup, we could see some shuffling at the front to try and break the stagnation.  To me the final score isn't what matters in this game. SKC is a solid team from the other conference; not winning isn't the end of the world. What matters to me is how the Union play. If they are disorganized, sloppy, and someone gets a stupid red, it's no longer early season troubles, it's systematic flaws. But if they play well, even making concessions for missing pieces like Chaco and Williams, then I am okay. Even if the Union lose."

Without Maidana, Sapong and Pfeffer, yeah, they looked hideous, but I'm not ready to toss this season in the trash."
PhillyUnion,316l8f,Mountainhawk98,3,Thu Apr 2 14:05:43 2015 UTC,"A team that completely collapses when one player is missing (Maidana) is a team with huge problems and enough to justify this attitude by itself. A starting XI isn't playoff quality - depth is what takes teams to the playoffs. Maybe with some unexpected spending over the summer we can scrape across the 48ish point line, but Id be surprised."
PhillyUnion,316l8f,m4nu,2,Fri Apr 3 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"Even against Dallas the game was evenly matched until Pfeffer got the red. Even then Dallas played a totally defensive game to try to save the points that Fabinho handed to them. Our bench is bad, and when we have Fabinho and Lahoud starting with Hoppenot and added the only attacking players on the bench were gonna look bad. But when the full team gets back they can still be a playoff quality team. They showed it in the first two and a half games."

PhillyUnion,30zb19,dseid,11,Tue Mar 31 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"Okay let's all stop being drama queens and harbingers of the apocalypse here for a second. I'm not going to deny that we suck. And suck hard. Like vacuum powered by black holes suck. But let's step back and try and get some perspective on this season so far.   So far this season we've been plagued by shit refs and injured players. In a team with about as much depth as a kiddie pool you can imagine the outcome of any head first dives. Not only that but the two times we've played at home the weather potentially screwed the pitch a bit.   So we've had a run of some real bad luck these first four games. ""But what about the actual issues we can help?"" You shout through tears and anguish. That being the lack of depth, our seemingly indifferent and money grubbing FO, good ol' (ball)Sak, and our terribly inexperienced head coach. Let me remind you how goddamn early it is in the season. Four games. Just four. That's all. This season goes to October with a game nearly every single week from now until then. Sometimes more with the open cup! Let me remind you that we brought on some new players in the off season that are currently seeing a lot of minutes. There are bound to be instances where the team doesn't exactly find a rhythm together when they've played as a unit for such a short time. Let's couple that with our inexperienced and not so tactically minded head coach that is way too cautious for his own good because of that. I'd just like to say, GIVE THE MAN A FUCKING CHANCE. No he's not that great now but I really do see some promise if we allow him the chance. I do wish we had seen someone come in from outside the team with more experience, but right now we have Curtin. Give him a chance to learn the way our new players work with the old. Give him a chance to figure what shit works when the majority of our A and B team aren't bedridden.   For fucks sake give things time. It's not even April yet. Do I think we're going to make the playoffs this year? No. Flat out no. But I do think that we will get better as the season goes on and we will end the season on a positive note. (And if we don't I will tattoo that Chivas/Philly thing posted earlier on my damn forehead.)   I promise you that our young, young team will have its moment in the sun. And it will be all the sweeter when we get it because of times like these."
PhillyUnion,30zb19,bear_antlers,4,Wed Apr 1 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to watch Philadelphians debate the Union because it obviously comes from a place of love as a sports town, and yet a lot of the criticism is so often short-sighted like with the city's other teams.  The Phillies went 28 years in-between World Series wins; that's five Union lifetimes. When was the last time the Flyers, Sixers, or Eagles held up a big trophy?  Hell, we were just in the US Open Cup final and slugged it out with a team boasting a 40-year history and a gigantic budget to match.  This sport is about the long run: about establishing a team's image, mythology, history. It's about creating an academy, seeing it flourish, seeing players start to graduate to the top team on a regular basis. It's about players wanting to finish their career at PPL Park and have their number retired.  Look at Arsenal as an example - they've been around for nearly 130 years and regularly gone 5, 10, 18 seasons between league titles. Surely their fans have learned a bit of patience? Or Southampton. Quite a trophy cabinet, eh?  The short run sucks, and it's really tough to overcome that American expectation that our team is a massive disappointment if they aren't a title contender every single season.  But until the U become a contender we have to remember that while it's totally okay for us to blow off steam on the team, or the front office, or the owner, or whoever, there's still that long run. And if we can be patient enough to see the team through, we'll be better fans for having done so."
PhillyUnion,30zb19,dokool,4,Wed Apr 1 07:54:38 2015 UTC,"This sport is about the long run: about establishing a team's image, mythology, history.    But we're not doing that either, that's the problem."
PhillyUnion,30zb19,drewuke,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that beyond the Sons of Ben origin story, the idea of who the Union ""are"" is a bit fuzzy. And I think part of that comes from Philadelphia being such a crowded sports environment, and all of the other teams having such rich histories in comparison. How do you compare to the Broad Street Bullies, Doctor J, the legendary misfits of 1993, or the infamous 700 Level days?  You can't, really. I'm not going to argue that the club have pulled their weight when it comes to building a team identity, but it's a tall order in Philadelphia which is why I'm going to be patient, enjoy the team for what it is and the supporters for what they are, and wait for the right combination of things to click."
PhillyUnion,30zb19,dokool,3,Thu Apr 2 04:58:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I disagree.  Our culture is far more utilitarian than any other country in the world - it is what makes us American instead of German or Thai or whatever.  Arsenal is a great counterexample of this.  Does New York have 12 first or second division teams in any sport?  No - yet that is just the case in London football, apparently because every neighborhood just has to have its own club, no matter how crappy it is.  In the US, it just doesn't make sense to put a lot of financial or emotional investment into a professional sports team that consistently loses.  We can always ""change the channel"" (and have done so for over 100 years of mass media).  If soccer is about the long run, the Union is establishing an image as a bunch of incompetents.  We have gone downhill since our establishment: our home winning percentage is worse than our first year.  Criticism is very much warranted."
PhillyUnion,30zb19,thewizardofosmium,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:58:59 2015 UTC,"And by the way, i don't buy the Seattle propaganda that the Sounders are a 40-year old team.  Ten years ago they were attracting a few thousand to a miniscule stadium in a terrible league.  They became a brand new team operating under different rules once they entered MLS.  So they are not much older than the Union.  The difference is that they have a staff of soccer savvy people and an owner with deep pockets.  We have neither.  Tell me about how good the Seattle fanbase is once they have had a few seasons with a losing record.  Wasn't it just 2 years ago they were up in arms when their team was in the middle of the Western Division?"

It's very easy to be negative when your team isn't doing well, and probably even a bit easier when your team has ""Philadelphia"" in it as well. I have seen a lot of negative posts here the past few weeks and sometimes even I get a bit negative, but we need to remind ourselves that it IS very early in the season, we do have a young and inexperienced manager in Curtin, and we have a couple new players this year that still need to gel with the rest of the squad.   I think if the first two games went in our favor then hardly as much negativity posted here would be posted. Look this is Philly, this is the Union. We may not be the best and yes sometimes we may suck more than Chicago, but God dammit do we have a fantastic fan base with a SG that GOT us a team. This is a team and a fan base of love, passion, and bastards. We need to remember that it's really early and we have a lot of time to make up the past few games. I still believe in our team.

I would not say that any of the teams they have played so far looked any better than that u23 or Londoners team.  Hell even in the 2-0 loss to FC Dallas they had a good number of attempts that all got sent sailing over the crossbar.  You would almost think they were trying out for the Eagles as fieldgoal unit."

Now we're stuck with guys like Fabinho, White, and Le Toux starting, no cohesion anywhere on the field, no imagination from the manager, and a bunch of ""we need to be better"" without changing a thing.  Seriously, try SOMETHING different.  You have one fucking player doing his job on a consistent basis, and yet nothing is changing except for who's available.  If you don't feel like you have better options, move guys around, change the formation, do SOMETHING.  To continue throwing out this 4-5-1 with all the same guys each week is fucking stupid.  There's no connection at all between anybody.  If it wasn't for Maidana's solo creativity and quick thinking, this team would have no goals and shockingly few chances.  Wait, what's that?

PhillyUnion,30tlgc,jpoRS,2,Mon Mar 30 18:25:10 2015 UTC,This was my first thought but my second thought was that he should take it since our season may very well already be in the shitter. The more experience he gets the more likely it is he will become a key part of our team in the future.

PhillyUnion,30tlgc,BissAu,6,Mon Mar 30 20:05:42 2015 UTC,I hope this signals to the FO that we need to KEEP Pfeffer and future players like him and not trade him away for a damn draft pick or something. He's a quality player than can really help the team.
PhillyUnion,30tlgc,WJMorris3,2,Mon Mar 30 20:42:44 2015 UTC,He's a really talented player and I hope he takes advantage of it. We are an awful team right now but every time he plays he shows that he has that touch of class to influence games and add an extra touch of quality in between the lines.
PhillyUnion,30u4az,Timothy-H,9,Mon Mar 30 18:56:51 2015 UTC,Really the only regret I have is not being able to sign a CDM this offseason.  Edu in the backline would make our D so much more solid.    I have no problem with Cruz being gone.  Can't really comment on Berry until we get a look at Marquez.  Although I feel like the Berry/Cruz moves had more to do with not wanting to have their larger salaries sitting on the bench.
PhillyUnion,30u4az,Dean_Moriarty,3,Mon Mar 30 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"I thought it was more likely a good CB would be signed and that Edu would shine in the midfield. Now, given the games we've seen so far, it doesn't look like either of those have happened. But the impact of the red cards and officiating catastrophe that was the Colorado game can't be underestimated. We've barely seen this team at full strength.  Cruz and Berry needed to go. I wish them both well but they weren't bringing anything we didn't already have. Especially with Cruz's salary being as high as it was."
PhillyUnion,30u4az,goatyhead,3,Tue Mar 31 12:49:10 2015 UTC,I prefer Cruz to Hoppenot by a huge margin.
PhillyUnion,30u4az,KFCConspiracy,2,Tue Mar 31 14:32:13 2015 UTC,There's no real reason why we shouldn't be able to do a lot better than both of them.
PhillyUnion,30u4az,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"No doubt, but of the talent who was available what 2 weeks ago? I would rather see Hoppenot outright cut from the team than Cruz sent to Norway for a season."
PhillyUnion,30u4az,KFCConspiracy,5,Tue Mar 31 17:37:56 2015 UTC,Leo has potential but just didn't seem close enough last year. Berry I though was a good option but clearly he isn't good enough for event he Cosmos so he shouldn't be good enough for us.  Fred is fucking old. Cruz I'm not really sure but I was never a fan of him as a player although he seems to be a great person. How did Hoppenot make our roster. White has been Meh it was a dumb foul along with poor marking and goal keeping on that Chicago goal.    Getting rid of Okugo and protecting Fabi over Ribbero is at this point embarrassing.
PhillyUnion,30u4az,akuller,5,Tue Mar 31 00:36:21 2015 UTC,I'm alright at losing Cruz and Berry and I know that Okugo would probably have been gone anyway after this year but man would I love to have him and Ribeiro right now..

As others have pointed out, the fact that we let Okugo walk and protected Fabinho over Ribeiro is ludicrous. That would not fix all of our issues, but it would solidify depth and quality in midfield. For the third consecutive season, we also failed to sign a starting quality left back. If that happened, we would have depth at both fullback positions, which is absolutely depleted right now."

I mean he was supposed to be one of our big name signings and he is just pulling cards and standing around... Maybe its because Nando had such an obvious impact that one game but I feel like Vitoria was supposed to be what solidified our backline and its not working. It seems like we potentially fixed one problem only to have 7 more show up. If everyone stayed in form and we kept Okugo and maybe Ribeiro we would potentially be at the other end of the list...
PhillyUnion,30u4az,goatyhead,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:05:00 2015 UTC,Whatever is going on with him I don't think the pairing with White is working especially well. But I'm not sure which half of the equation to should be changed first.

Sure moving Edu back would help but the pairing with him and White is not working. Rais is also not playing to standard. Highest paid goalie in MLS and he is about the same skill level as MacMath.
PhillyUnion,30u4az,thanksbastards,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:42:56 2015 UTC,"FYI, Rais is not the highest paid goalie in MLS, at least by base salary: http://www.spotrac.com/mls/rankings/base/goalkeeper/  I don't know that he isn't performing well either, with a wacky back four to deal with any GK is going to have problems. I still think he is a big upgrade, maybe not a huge one like Sak would've had us believe. But that's on Sak's ego not the player."

PhillyUnion,30r99p,midwesternhousewives,2,Tue Mar 31 16:19:32 2015 UTC,Well this is a little drastic.  The difference is Chivas couldn't fill the stands.  Union still turn a profit.
PhillyUnion,30r99p,cjd5286,8,Mon Mar 30 19:12:23 2015 UTC,For now...
PhillyUnion,30r99p,ignoramis,2,Mon Mar 30 19:34:55 2015 UTC,Come on we just are having a rough start. 4 games it's way too early to start comparing us to Chivas

PhillyUnion,30r99p,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:05:08 2015 UTC,Yeah but every season plays out differently. Let's let this one play out a bit more before we all rush to judgement.
PhillyUnion,30r99p,bit99,6,Mon Mar 30 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"They have?   2010 - 31 pts, 1.03 PPG  2011 - 48 pts, 1.41 PPG (our ""high"" water mark so far)  2012 - 36 pts, 1.06 PPG  2013 - 46 pts, 1.35 PPG  2014 - 42 pts, 1.24 PPG  2015 - 2 pts through 4 games for a PPG of 0.5 and currently worst in the league  Looks like the definition of mediocrity to me."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,drewuke,19,Sun Mar 29 22:54:39 2015 UTC,I hope Curtin has the balls to bench Le Toux next game.
PhillyUnion,30qvle,Dean_Moriarty,5,Sun Mar 29 23:03:31 2015 UTC,Le Touch has been so bad this season.  My four year kid has a better touch than he does. Does he count as an international still?  What a waste of money/international spot if it is true.
PhillyUnion,30qvle,D-Wall73,2,Mon Mar 30 13:50:07 2015 UTC,He has had his green card for years.
PhillyUnion,30qvle,FlapjackJackson,2,Mon Mar 30 14:33:03 2015 UTC,Remember when people wanted to retire his number 2 years back? I laugh to myself every time he skies a corner or sends it into the feet of the first defender...

PhillyUnion,30qvle,hoax021,21,Sun Mar 29 23:19:00 2015 UTC,"It's easy to name names on the field, but to do so misses the real problem for this team. Did anyone really expect Fabinho to play any better than he did today? Is it fair to expect Lahoud to be anything more than a warm body? Who doesn't know that Wenger is still a raw and unready player? So why are they starting? Because instead of decent backups (or starters at key positions) we have players like Fabinho, Lahoud, Carrol, Fred, etc. It's fine and good to have a wink and a nudge with Fred pretending to be a coach, but in a salary capped league we simply don't have enough room to keep these guys around.  FO needs to step up, cut the fat, and bring in some real players. We've got talent in spots, but they lack the support they need to really succeed."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,jpoRS,8,Sun Mar 29 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"Hell that's the main reason we lost the Open Cup last year. Our starting XI were damn near, if not completely, on par with Seattle. We just didn't have the quality bench they did."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,gotboredwithrest,9,Sun Mar 29 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"They don't even need to be great. All I am arguing for is a LB that isn't a walking liability. And a true winger so we can bench Le Toux/Wenger when they aren't working out. Maybe a CB so we have some depth there. Our attack is a fluke right now because Sapong, Chaco, and Casey are all injured so frankly I think we're square there. In my opinion that's all that is standing between this team and competence, if not greatness. But instead we keep paying ""players"" who never will (or should) see a minute of play."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,jpoRS,21,Sun Mar 29 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"I can't even get on the players or technical staff, they are what they are.   Just sell the club. Please. Find an owner with some passion and imagination."

PhillyUnion,30qvle,thelostdolphin,8,Mon Mar 30 13:26:27 2015 UTC,We're middle of the pack in spending. Crying poor is no excuse for the piss poor product on the field.

PhillyUnion,30qvle,EdBacon,2,Mon Mar 30 13:41:00 2015 UTC,They've also been a team 6 years longer than us and the player development that they have established is paying the dividends ours will be soon. The main purpose of hiring Muelensteen was to focus on youth development since that's our best strategy if we're not going to be able to solve all our problems by throwing money at them.
PhillyUnion,30qvle,thelostdolphin,4,Mon Mar 30 13:45:05 2015 UTC,"So its a 12 year plan now? Well now I feel much better.   Sorry, but I'm not buying it.

PhillyUnion,30qvle,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:18:33 2015 UTC,Honest question. Why do you bother following the team when all you do is complain about it?

PhillyUnion,30qvle,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:41:24 2015 UTC,Don't forget that RSL was even worse than us until they brought in a great GM.  That column about how Sackewicz has done a pretty good job except on the player front describes the situation best.  We don't need a Meulensteen or other consultant.  We need a person familiar with the ins and outs of MLS salary rules AND who is a good judge of talent.
PhillyUnion,30qvle,thewizardofosmium,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"I think most people would like to see a better GM, but I'm trying to remain even keeled and realistic about what we have in our favor now and if a new GM isn't coming at the moment, having a guy like Muelensteen help bolster our development program is a good step.   It's so early in the season that I'm still fairly confident that, barring another string of ridiculous injuries like we've current undergone, we'll get things rolling. Also, we'll likely start seeing the young guys down in Harrisburg slowly get integrated into the first team. Once we have guys like Catic and McLaughlin available off the bench, that will make our depth seems less dire as what we had to work with yesterday."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"Is ""thelostdolphin"" Jim Curtin? I go to every home game. Union soccer is ugly!! Either the pieces don't fit or they are not being utilized properly.  There is no creativity, especially in the final third. The defense is suspect at best. Nog gets the ball and dribbles in a circle every time he gets the ball and he is our attacking midfielder when Maidana is out. The front office and coaching staff have made huge mistakes with player personal. Curtin and Albright have to go. The Union need a seasoned coach."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,runlevel06,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry to spoil the hacky ""fire x"" circlejerk that inevitably fills most internet sports forums after a couple losses.   For me personally, I'm withholding judgment until the actual starting XI plus 2-3 quality subs are healthy or back from discipline to play more than once together as a team. I'm also giving Curtin more than 4 weeks this season before I call for his head since he has a winning record so far as a coach and nearly got us into the playoffs if not for the USOC burnout at the end of last season. If in another month or two things aren't getting better, then obviously something drastic has to happen, but calling for it now is silly and utterly predictable."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,thelostdolphin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:05:13 2015 UTC,"We just lost to Chicago who had the worse record in the league and were missing two DPs. Everyone has injuries. I'm not withholding judgement because I was ""at"" all the home games that Jim Curtain coached last year and this year and there is no difference. It's his job to have the team ready to play. The team came out flat in one of the most important games on the early season. They needed to win or at least put out a strong performance. They did neither. This isn't a year for patience. The league has grown and is getting stronger. We are behind the curve and have a very tough schedule. You withhold your judgement but I'm not wasting another grand on Union tickets if they don't make the playoffs. So call me a fair weathered supporter."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,runlevel06,16,Fri Apr 3 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for Curtin in a sense. While he is probably too young and raw to be a coach at this level, he was thrown out to the wolves and will end up being the fall guy for when the team ""moves in another direction"", shouldering the blame for a terrible team that isn't entirely his fault."

We made some good moves in the off-season but as always when important players are out like today, Fabinho, Lahoud and Fred are our best options and young guys like Ayuk get 8 minutes.    What happens when White or Vitoria inevitably have to miss a game? or another fullback is out? Leftback has been criminally neglected, its bad when I'm wishing we still had Danny Cruz and losing Okugo and Ribeiro will go down as some of the worst moves this club have ever made.    Look, I'm far from the stereotypical Philly fan, I watched the Sixers last year and I'm excited for the future; I'm not worried about the Flyers or the Eagles because I know they expect to compete for championships and they're going to do something to get themselves back to being regular playoff teams.   I have no confidence that the Union management have that mindset, they've done little to nothing to show it to us. What's even more disappointing is that we have one of the best stadiums in MLS and, I think, a fanbase on par with teams like Seattle and Portland but we get none of the love they do because the management has yet to put out a squad that can realistically compete for the title.  I thought this could be our year and it yet could but I'm not very happy right now.  /walloftext"
PhillyUnion,30qvle,truckloadof4skin,3,Mon Mar 30 06:02:06 2015 UTC,"what is it going to take for the ownership and FO to really take this team seriously?   empty stadiums and low tv ratings from an apathetic fan base.

Our owner just doesn't have anywhere near the money of many other clubs so our depth is weak and our youth system, which is really starting to look promising, just isn't paying dividends this early in the process yet. It's silly to assess the quality of our team when players we only use sparingly and never all at once had to all be on the field for 90 mins yesterday. The number of injuries (and Pfeffer's red card) that we are dealing with all at once is a complete anomaly and the weirdness of the situation is reflected in the starting XI Curtin had the unfortunate need to go with. On top of that, players who for months on end last year were playing really really well, specifically Le Toux and Wenger, aren't up to snuff yet. Their quality last season is the reason why this is the first consecutive losses we've suffered since last June. Unless they both forgot how to soccer, that will likely change as our real starting XI reemerges.  I hope ownership can take on some more investors to help with position depth. That's the much more realistic (and less self-indulgence) solution than calling for the selling of the entire team 4 weeks into a season. In the meantime, let's just think happy thoughts about the guys we want to see on the field coming back in the coming week or two and finally giving them a chance to build some chemistry, which hasn't been a possibility for the first month."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,jpoRS,2,Mon Mar 30 13:38:23 2015 UTC,"This. Everyone read this.   Criticism is fine. Lamenting a loss is fine. Frustration with a bad start to the season is fine, but can we please be a little less dramatic?  There is talent on our team. Remember that the first two weeks should have been victories but the team got screwed with their pants on by the refs (I hate using refs as an excuse, but those two games are exceptions to my usual rule).  Remember that we actually hung with FC Dallas (the best team in the league right now) for 40 minutes. Then Pfeffer's elbow wen't rogue and got him ejected (deservedly so too, that was a bad foul and if that had happened to one of our players I'd be calling for a red too). I'm not sure any team in the league would be able to play with 10 men against Dallas for an entire half and come out on top.  Chicago... Listen, I'm not going to sugar coat this one, we looked bad, and so did Chicago. That was an ugly game. But we lost our attacking creativity with Pfeffer and Maidana out. With Williams out we had to bring in the defensive liability that is Fabinho. Without Sapong we don't have a very good option to sub for Wenger or Le Toux who are both out of form right now.   This isn't a good start, but I think we should probably put away our pitchforks. It's a long season."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,LocksTheFox,0,Tue Mar 31 20:16:29 2015 UTC,This team doesn't look good at all. M'Bohli wasn't at fault for the goal but it didn't look like he'd actually save it if it was untouched. Going forward we have three players with skill one was hurt and Nogs and Fernando can only do so much.   Also that's a harsh red.
PhillyUnion,30qvle,DrewGo,0,Sun Mar 29 22:57:06 2015 UTC,"So i'll admit I only caught maybe 30 minutes of the game today but I was at the Dallas game and watched our other 2 games entirely and have noticed a few things.    LeToux should only be taking corners if Conor Casey is in and making a near post run.. other than that they've been garbage.  Second, M'bolhi plays with absolutely no hunger/desire/heart for philly, yes he is ""philly tough"" but he hasn't shown much emotion and, to be honest, hasn't looked like a good keeper(+Apparently he was shanking kicks today).   Third, Edu's first-touches (Actually more like half the teams) have been just awful. Like horrendous.. he takes a touch and it goes like 5 yards ahead of him. Maybe it only happens every so often and I always seem to catch it but as our DP and captain, ffs have a good touch. Do I even need to say anything about our defense on a thread of fellow Union supporters?  Edit: Formatting"
PhillyUnion,30qvle,jpoRS,8,Sun Mar 29 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"EVERY KEEPER IN THIS LEAGUE MISHITS A KICK HERE AND THERE.  I don't know what's so hard to get about that, and why it's the first thing people go to. Seitz did it. Mondragon did it. MacMath did it. Fucking Ricketts, Rimando, etc. mishit some kicks throughout a match. Let's leave that horse to die, please."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,DrewGo,2,Sun Mar 29 23:51:33 2015 UTC,"I never thought I'd miss Chris Seitz... Oh wait, I still don't.  I miss Mondragon, and Macmath.  I mean, was 2011 really our high point?"
PhillyUnion,30qvle,jpoRS,0,Mon Mar 30 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"Not really my complaint but the goal scored on him when we were playing Dallas, C'mon. Plus, I have high expectations on him considering he probably has a sizable contract"
PhillyUnion,30qvle,DrewGo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"probably has a sizable contract   He's not a DP anymore, so it can't be that sizable."
PhillyUnion,30qvle,jpoRS,4,Mon Mar 30 01:14:57 2015 UTC,IIRC he was only a DP due to transfer fee. Same with Chaco.
PhillyUnion,30qvle,marksills,3,Mon Mar 30 04:47:34 2015 UTC,He's the highest paid keeper in the league. So it's sizable enough.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,ethic_,6,Sun Mar 29 23:01:38 2015 UTC,I dont think its coaching maybe with Pfeffer since he is young but Fred has been around he should know better then to give it that extra something next to the ref. If you didnt see it he swung his arm at the players face and hit him after being shoved. Our midfield and defense need work but we have some key parts.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,spqr-king,7,Sun Mar 29 23:40:57 2015 UTC,Edu is not the type of player who should have the highest salary on a money-ball/ low budget team.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,cjd5286,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:47:32 2015 UTC,I agree. Edu and Le Toux have looked terrible so far this season.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,Invas10n,6,Mon Mar 30 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"The excuse this year is injuries right? This organization from top to bottom is “Keystone Cops,” What a total joke they are. On a real team with any kind of depth Wenger, Le Toux, Gaddis , and White would be 2nd and 3rd options coming off of the bench. The rest of the starters today were an absolute joke. How can Sugarman and this feckless ownership group possibly think this is acceptable in the 4th largest sports and media market in the country and 2nd on the US east coast? How can being mid-level to worst in MLS be ok with them? I would like to know what kind of practices Jim Curtin and staff run. The skill with the ball is laughable. They lose every 2nd ball and fall flat on the faces in the offensive zone.The backline no matter what combo is out there is shite! Mbohi sleeps through the whole game! Where are the SoB’s? Why aren’t they publicly calling this ownership out? We need financially competitive ownership in order to compete with our biggest rival in the league. This fan base deserves better then a bottom feeding 2nd rate outpost as the Philadelphia MLS franchise. No more lame excuses should be accepted from this dog and pony show. Bring in skilled players so that we don’t have to rely on so many players on this team with inadequate pro soccer skills and IQ’s. This organization needs to have a GM put in place immediately, and not some wait and see temp. There is no way Curtin and Albright should be the ones making player acquisitions and moves. This organization is a complete embarrassment!"
PhillyUnion,30qwed,LCBline,5,Mon Mar 30 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"It's not just spending though, its coaching and management of the players. At this point the Union have ruined more promising young players or ended more careers than they've helped develop talent. The cases where somebody does see some genuine progress end up being terribly mismanaged (see McInerney and MacMath). Yeah, we completely lack depth, but what we do have is further hamstrung by a completely gutted technical staff that's nowhere near the task of building and training a team to compete in MLS. At this point we have to start holding ownership responsible. They've made it pretty clear they're in this business to make money, period, and their strategy doesn't include actually fielding a workable soccer team."
PhillyUnion,30qwed,EdBacon,2,Mon Mar 30 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"Truth. The talent level in the MLS isn't that widely varied from team-to-team (save for the big spenders), so the difference is in the coaching of the players and the ability to turn a run-of-the-mill MLS pro into a USMNT-caliber player (even if they're USMNT B team).  RSL has done this with Wingert, Schuler, Beltran, Beckerman, Findlay, Borchers. SKC with Besler, Zusi, Dwyer, Espinoza. LA with Magee, Zardes, Gonzalez, DeLaGarza, Franklin.  Proper coaching is needed. Not some genius tactician. Just a good coach that can teach this team how to play."
PhillyUnion,30qwed,estebandelasexface12,2,Tue Mar 31 03:01:25 2015 UTC,"i said months ago multiple times that this was the worst team we've ever entered a season with and was expecting us to finish second to last in the east. downvoted.  it's all god though. i understand hope and optimism, but this team never deserved either from any of you. said it before and will keep saying it, this team (FO) is perfectly fine with mediocrity. in fact, it's their business model."
PhillyUnion,30qwed,phancypheetz,2,Mon Mar 30 13:55:14 2015 UTC,"everyone was talking about the coaching this year, they are going to talk about the coaching again. It's not the coaching. It's the talent."
PhillyUnion,30qwed,bit99,2,Mon Mar 30 15:10:19 2015 UTC,no..its definitely the coaching. curtin is clueless.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,hoax021,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:15:13 2015 UTC,the coaching isn't good or even decent but every year they ask these coaches to make chicken salad out of you know what
PhillyUnion,30qwed,bit99,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:32:20 2015 UTC,I think the red cards are a function of the team sucking as opposed to thuggery/lack of discipline. When you're chasing all the time it's easier to get frustrated and lash out.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,chrisronald67,-1,Mon Mar 30 12:49:16 2015 UTC,I thought the red was fairly weak. Totally sucks to lose a man again.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,jaysonjaz,5,Sun Mar 29 23:12:04 2015 UTC,How could you not see it? They replayed it and the clips are online now. Fred open palmed slapped Shipp in the face. It's an obvious red.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,EdBacon,-3,Mon Mar 30 02:07:53 2015 UTC,that was the back of his neck. not really a red card. At this point i dont even care and would just rather see us keep losing because well if we have a REALLY bad year maybe we'll clean house...maybe
PhillyUnion,30qwed,hoax021,4,Mon Mar 30 10:17:19 2015 UTC,"Arm raised, swinging at a player completely off the ball is a red any day of the week."
PhillyUnion,30qwed,EdBacon,0,Mon Mar 30 11:46:33 2015 UTC,I really want to know the reason for it. He must have said something to ref right?
PhillyUnion,30qwed,jaysonjaz,0,Sun Mar 29 23:26:06 2015 UTC,Had to have been. Especially with the way it was delayed like that.
PhillyUnion,30qwed,spqr-king,3,Sun Mar 29 23:28:05 2015 UTC,No he swung at the player who shoved him and the ref saw the hit not the shove. He should know better being a vet keep your arms down and away from peoples face or its a card. Its wasnt as bad as Pfeffer and I think it was a yellow at most but im not a ref...
PhillyUnion,30qwed,timofree,5,Sun Mar 29 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"It's simply excessive force in the form of violent conduct, especially since it seems a bit retaliatory. Couple that with a short proximity to the ref and it is a red every time."

PhillyUnion,30qxtb,Keepa1,5,Sun Mar 29 23:27:08 2015 UTC,"At some point they'll have fired their whole technical staff via promoting them to coach, then sacking them when they inevitably fail for being out of their depth."
PhillyUnion,30qxtb,EdBacon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:50:37 2015 UTC,this team isn't really bad because of depth. How often are we winning or playing well with our actual starting xi? not very often so it's not depth but just the whole team. I personally think it's the coaching. We came out this season looking hard. Laviolette got fired for this after 3 games with the flyers a few years back. If you don't know how to properly get your team ready your gonna look poor and disjointed like the union do.
PhillyUnion,30qxtb,hoax021,1 point,Mon Mar 30 10:20:19 2015 UTC,"I mean the coaching staff is ""out of their depth"" meaning like, they're in over their heads and can't handle the responsibilities of training a team to be competitive in MLS."

PhillyUnion,30qxtb,drewuke,2,Sun Mar 29 23:19:20 2015 UTC,No and yes. Yes and no. I think we have some talent but most of our players are playing way below average right now. We pay high and get low performing players and im positive its the FO. We should not be paying M'bolhi as much as we are for his skill level which is on par with Macmath from what I have seen . We need to focus on defense I thought Vitoria would be a improvement but so far he also been below average. We also have a lot of injuries right now and have had 2 red cards in 4 matches before the half. I hope they dont fire Curtain as I like his work ethic and believe the FO and the players are to blame.
PhillyUnion,30qxtb,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"There isn't much change in players since last year. Curtin had those players on a hot streak that took us to the USOC Final. I don't blame him.... yet.  But these same players are just playing bad. Le Toux is very poor, Wenger is indecisive, set piece defending is still bad, and our attacking mids only like to stick around for one game before getting hurt or sent off. Injuries are plaguing Philly. And there is no depth that is a proven commodity. I'd happily have Danny Cruz right now. Give Jimmy Mac and Marquez a shot... cant hurt to try it.  I think Curtin gets cut if the ship isn't righted. By week 15 the team will either be contending or he'll be hanging with Hackworth."

PhillyUnion,30r0jo,spqr-king,11,Sun Mar 29 23:38:54 2015 UTC,"Fuck that. I've stuck with this club when the results didn't come. I vouched for Hack and I even argued that our off-season moves were intelligent enough to make up for our lack of spending. I can accept good play / progress over results.   But shit - that was awful. It looked like youth football tonight.   A team that Lahoud and Fabino can start and play 90 minutes will end up being a joke in a league that is getting better and better each year.   Your going to start losing us, Philly. Sure the faithful, die-hard will stay, but at least a third of that stadium will not buy tickets to such an awful team.   Edit: The Fire, fellas. The 'effing Fire. http://streamable.com/6jkk"
PhillyUnion,30r0jo,4-1-3-2,-4,Mon Mar 30 00:53:38 2015 UTC,Lahoud and Fabino are out of pure need for players. Our entire system was switched up tonight with all sorts of players out of place.

PhillyUnion,30r0jo,4-1-3-2,10,Mon Mar 30 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"First, stop with this ""true fans"" nonsense.  I can have my opinion and you yours - neither makes us less or more a supporter.  I'm just unwilling to blindly hope things will get better, despite (maybe because of) doing so for three seasons now.  I was saying almost exactly what you are saying now at various points for the past few seasons - I now think it's misguided. It's always ""maybe next season"". We're being played for fools by this FO."
PhillyUnion,30r0jo,EdBacon,-1,Mon Mar 30 02:12:41 2015 UTC,I didnt mean to insinuate your not a true fan but rather that casual spectators will come and go but seeing the little improvements year to year will keep people who actively support stay. I agree this FO seems to have no idea what they are doing but that can change. Its always maybe next season for most teams because so few teams are champions and or elite and we dont have to be it would just be nice to see some efforts or results and I think that will come later. The first 3 games I saw a lot of potential when everyone is healthy and back I think we will perform better.
PhillyUnion,30r0jo,m4nu,3,Mon Mar 30 11:51:30 2015 UTC,What little improvements year to year?

PhillyUnion,30r0jo,Too_many_hippos,0,Mon Mar 30 00:28:27 2015 UTC,Parts of the team are shit. The way our FO plays and how they operate is going to make it that way until we get a new owner if ever. That being said if pieces of the puzzle look good we should acknowledge them and carry on. I still see a lot of potential if all our players come back from IR and well and we get our defense sorted out in the next window.
PhillyUnion,30r0jo,ignoramis,6,Mon Mar 30 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't see this team improving until the ownership group moves on and new management comes in. People say the same thing every year, that the pieces look good and its just a matter of time, and we get the same result over and over. It's an issue of leadership and organization. The players might have the talent as individuals, but ownership never cares enough to have them coached and conditioned into a real team. Our technical staff is a skeleton of what every other MLS team has. Our coaches are always upjumped assistants with no experience. We don't even have proper training facilities. A Sunday game of kick-about has been enough to get seats filled at PPL, and until we start demanding more I just don't see this narrative changing."

PhillyUnion,30mzo1,JawsJVH,7,Sat Mar 28 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"Until last week everyone was saying how we got the better of the McInerney/Wenger trade. Unless he goes on an absolute tear it won't really bother me.   Ribeiro is harder to work out. On the one hand, he saw very limited playing time and never stood out too much. Then you have to take into account he was a young player, had potential, and was generally played out of position. I think we can chalk this one up to the Union's inability to develop young talent more than retain a known asset. They didn't know what to do with Pedro and so dealt him to another team.   Not that they know how to retain talent either, but I'm just saying."
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,EdBacon,2,Sat Mar 28 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't mind the Wenger trade.  I wish we had dealt Petro to another team, it would have made more sense than just letting him go."
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,in_the_against,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"I would prefer we actually developed some players. Off the top of my head I can't think of a single player that came to Philly and built a career, or turned one around, or otherwise progressed.   Maybe Okugo and MacMath were exceptions to that, but of course we got rid of them."
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,EdBacon,2,Sun Mar 29 01:12:20 2015 UTC,"Okugo, MacMath, Le Toux, Gaddis, Williams, McInerney. Yeah, some people get traded when their stock increases. It happens."

PhillyUnion,30mzo1,Mike81890,7,Sun Mar 29 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"I wish we still had okugo, but thats only because i think edu should be one of our center backs. Even if Mcinerny and Ribero where on our roster i don't think they would see much playing time because of how good fernando and sapong are."
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,truckloadof4skin,2,Sat Mar 28 23:43:42 2015 UTC,Edu needs to play CB! His tendency to get caught upfield (and his lack of hustle back) has left the back line pretty exposed.
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,cjd5286,3,Sun Mar 29 00:26:08 2015 UTC,Our winning percentage with Edu at CB is much higher than with him in the midfield.
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,drewuke,9,Sun Mar 29 04:05:44 2015 UTC,Losing Ribeiro will haunt us for years...
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,in_the_against,6,Sat Mar 28 21:43:56 2015 UTC,We did get to keep Fabinho though!!
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,LocksTheFox,5,Sat Mar 28 21:45:04 2015 UTC,Fabinho can boil his head for ruining my birthday present that I waited two months for.
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,LocksTheFox,7,Sat Mar 28 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"Ultimately though, do we blame Fabinho, or do we blame management and ownership?   If a bad player is bad, is it the player's fault for being bad or management's/ownership's for putting him there?"
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,rabidfrodo,4,Sat Mar 28 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"That's true. (Still, I can hold my personal grudge on Fabinho for ruining my 19th birthday)   While we're at it, can people please stop villifying Rais for signing here? He WANTS to be here and management signed off on it...blame them, not the guy who actually enjoys being in Philly."
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,magnumbbrown,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:53:42 2015 UTC,I will when he plays like a starting keeper. I vilify him for his poor play.
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,ronaldo119,2,Sun Mar 29 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"Been saying the same thing since last season...still can't see how he's an upgrade over Macmath. Not that I'm saying Zak was the best keeper, but he knew the league and was solid early last season. Plus great penalty stops!"
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,in_the_against,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:15:16 2015 UTC,highly unlikely
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,ronaldo119,5,Sat Mar 28 22:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yea you are right, I'm sure Fabinho will turn it around and why would we want a goal or assist per game from a second year player?"
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,in_the_against,-2,Sat Mar 28 23:04:02 2015 UTC,goal or assist per game are you mad? He had one good game today when they had 15 players and has done nothing in their other 3 games. Last year he had 2 goals 0 assists. He also can't play left back a position every team in the world has trouble filling
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,ronaldo119,2,Sat Mar 28 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"Must have caught a preseason highlight of another goal of his. Also thought he played Kaka a ball for his first goal, maybe preseason as well. The pressure he put on for the own goal against Houston as well... So not mad, just not accurate.   Still would rather have Ribeiro and no Fabinho to play LB, than what we have now."
PhillyUnion,30mzo1,cjd5286,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:55:06 2015 UTC,Fact of the matter is neither one would/will play much for us and we don't have an LB on the roster and they're not easy to find. We have many different players to fill the depth at forward

PhillyUnion,30apwm,in_the_against,2,Fri Mar 27 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"How about this in a 4-4-2: M'Bolhi; Gaddis - Edu - Vittoria - Wenger; Ayuk - Lahoud - Noguiera - Fabinho; Le Toux; Aristeguieta   Wenger's work-rate, size, physicality, and ability to get back and defend make him a better fit at LB than anyone else on the roster at this point. He can get forward into the attack but still track back well, and he's not being tasked with finishing, which he isn't very good at. That enables Fabinho to move up the wing and lessens the burden on him defensively, which is ironically his weakest aspect given he's billed as a defender. Ayuk looked decent and I'd give him the nod on the right wing. Nogs would have to float forward over Lahoud, while Le Toux would play under Nando in the pure striker role. Most of the playmaking should come through Nogs, with Le Toux making runs.   It's sort of making the most of what we've got."

I'll take a break from doing work and try a variety of transfer combos, but then close out of the tab before I'm tempted to make them official.  I don't know if you use Evernote, or something like it, but what I do now is, throughout the week, go through each of my starting XI and decide how serious I am about transferring out my current players and then for the spots I'm genuinely considering to varying degrees, I'll list them in a new blank note and then research 2-3 options that might be worthy replacements per and list them in parentheses next to them. That way I scratch the itch, get a game plan sort of together, but then don't actually make any moves till Friday afternoon.  Just my two cents. I'm a newbie and am still figuring things out."

PhillyUnion,2zuh92,oooooooounbelievable,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:42:57 2015 UTC,"It does not make sense if no one has taken or made a good offer for Fabinho.  We could have Ribeiro starting with Maidana out, or at least subbing him in for depth if Maidana isn't fit."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,in_the_against,2,Sun Mar 22 02:49:50 2015 UTC,"but the point is, they obviously couldn't afford or find a lb this off-season and need to protect what thin defense we have"
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,oooooooounbelievable,-1,Sun Mar 22 02:53:21 2015 UTC,"Why waste a protection spot on someone that wouldn't get taken? I would rather play Wenger at left back than Fabinho, and still have Ribeiro as CAM depth."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,in_the_against,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"you can't say for sure that he wouldn't be taken, and that is a huge waste of wenger's talent"
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,oooooooounbelievable,0,Sun Mar 22 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I disagree.  If it would have meant we had a more talented team then we play the player in the position that makes the team better overall.  Additionally, there are some people who think Wenger is better suited to play in a defensive role ( http://www.brotherlygame.com/2015/2/23/8083099/andrew-wenger-to-real-madrid ) and maybe allowing him to attack along the wing from left back is something he could do well.  Certainly would be more beneficial to have Ribeiro on our team with Wenger back than having Wenger up and Fabhino back.  It is not like Wenger has been mind blowing on the left wing thus far...  I just feel it was a dumb move by the FO."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,in_the_against,2,Sun Mar 22 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"I don't agree at all. I'm so sick of the ""lets move this player from offense to defense"" experiments on this team. hell, Ribeiro was being used as a striker instead of a cam last season, and his contribution there was almost non existent. hindsight is 20/20, and now we have no depth at cam due to injury to Maidana and the red card for Pfeffer. but to have three cams to fill one position and two full backs to fill two positions is a worse move than protecting what options we have. yesterday, if we had let Fabinho go, we would have had no sub to replace Williams, but we would have had an extra cam on the bench who has scored a whopping one goal for Orlando."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,oooooooounbelievable,2,Sun Mar 22 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"he was very not good tonight. very, very not good."

It's the same thing every single year.  And we keep hearing about how our vision is to develop a team from youth talent, but it's year 6 and our academy products have now lost us more games than they have won."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,xxtoejamfootballxx,7,Sat Mar 21 22:09:34 2015 UTC,"Pfeffer speaks:  https://twitter.com/ZachPfeffer_27/status/579417874047041536 https://twitter.com/ZachPfeffer_27/status/579418245201035264 https://twitter.com/ZachPfeffer_27/status/579418432434733056   To all @PhilaUnion @MLS fans, I realized the foul looked bad on replay, however I want everyone to know it was absolutely not intentional  It was an unfortunate situation where I was just looking to get my body in position to win the ball. With my momentum and a wet pitch, it  made the incident seem worse than it was. Again, no intention what so ever! Will move on from here!"
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,Dean_Moriarty,10,Sat Mar 21 23:08:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he feels terrible about it.  Regardless of that incident it seems pretty apparent that Curtin wanted his guys to muck it up with Diaz, knock him off his game and not let him create anything.   Whether Pfeffer took that and just went in a little overzealous and accidently came in high with his arm, or if he was pissed off and just thought he could get away with taking a shot at Diaz doesn't really matter to me.  As long as he learns from it and doesn't do it again, he was having a pretty good game until that point too."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,Dean_Moriarty,3,Sat Mar 21 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"One problem is that Pfeffer got caught up field a bit when that long ball was played and Diaz had a few steps advantage getting to the knock down ball which put Pfeffer in a bad position to get back to defend, didn't make up the ground well obviously."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,dooper2010,6,Sun Mar 22 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on today's game. 1.) We miss Maidana badly.  We looked much lesser a threat last year when he was out and its happening again.  We're much more dynamic with him.  Everybody else looks better when he's out there. 2.) Watch the replay of the second Dallas goal.  Start about 15 seconds prior to.  Watch Edu.  He was doing that ---- last year too.  Captain too - ugh.  3.) Tactically, Gaddis should have been at right back today to shutdown Castillo.  SW at left. 4.) Pfeffer's red card play started with him getting caught too far upfield, didn't realize Diaz was behind him. Couldn't recover, had to strain to get back.  Didn't work out well. 5.) Team gave up after the first goal.  Never seemed to consider the potential for a makeup call by the ref after ZP's red.  Nobody leading in the face of the adversity at that point.  The veterans should know better.  Curtin looked inexperienced in that regard.  Experienced coaches would know how to sneak back into that game."

PhillyUnion,2zuh92,Too_many_hippos,5,Sun Mar 22 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"Sigh, well this time we can't 100% blame the refs. Missed a few calls, but honestly we didn't play great either.  Pfeffer obviously did something completely stupid and right now I have zero pity for him, he fucked up and deserves whatever is coming to him.  I thought we looked pretty damn good in the first half attacking-wise. A few missed opportunities though, which is disappointing. Second half it's like we just fell apart completely. Defense broke down, offense didn't make as many pushes into Dallas' end, just not a great second half overall.   Fabi didn't look good, I mean fuck that was bad. Le Toux wasn't great either, and he happens to be my favorite player so he might have been worse than what I want to admit.   Ayuk looked pretty decent out there after he came on, I think he shows promise.   idk, hard to process this early, just disappointed is all I guess, in many aspects."

PhillyUnion,2zuh92,empossible,5,Sat Mar 21 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"I felt like the team was playing fairly well, up until Fabinho had to remind every one that he was protected over Ribeiro.  Then there was no width and the complete ignoring of the overlapping runs.  Only Fernando, Gaddis, and Ayuk looked like they cared out there towards the end.  I can only hope that the money saved from shipping Cruz will bring in a competent LB (anyone know any solid left backs for around $125k?).    As much as it pains me to say this, Williams shouldn't start any more, at least not at right back.  He's a greater offensive threat than Gaddis, but Ray is just better overall at this point.  I wouldn't be opposed to swapping the two though, or having Williams at CB (White is not impressing me).  I honestly don't feel like FC Dallas won that match, only that the Union lost it."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sun Mar 22 00:46:55 2015 UTC,I can only hope that the money saved from shipping Cruz will bring in a competent LB (anyone know any solid left backs for around $125k?).   Doubt he's available and I don't know what it would take to get him but apparently De Jong has beat out Seth Sinovic for LB at SKC.  Sinovic has been really good for SKC the past couple years.

PhillyUnion,2zuh92,LocksTheFox,2,Sun Mar 22 03:31:05 2015 UTC,Lopez actually plays centerback first and foremost...probably Jordan Harvey then.  ...can we bring him back seeing as Vancouver prefers Adekugbe?
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,yung_swagged_out_mf,2,Sun Mar 22 03:34:02 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand how the team has neglected that position for so long, every year we are here saying how we need a LB"

PhillyUnion,2zuh92,mthslhrookiecard,8,Sat Mar 21 22:09:54 2015 UTC,"Trying to remain level headed with the season literally just starting. No one in the east has come out of the gates on fire and running away with it. So there's tons and tons of time to get things on track. And so much of the terribleness of this game came in the second half when we were down a man. Hardly the time to make an assessment of our quality, especially against a team as good as Dallas.  Hopefully Maidana's recovery time is closer to two weeks than four, especially now with Pfeffer's bozo foul. Hopefully Sapong can get back soon too and finds some Rip Hamilton mojo with his mask.   We all know Le Toux and Wenger can be huge play makers for us. Just look at most of the second half of last season to see what happens when they get hot. So I can't imagine that continuing all season. I really don't know what the deal is there. Le Toux's issues seem to be mental. He was uncharacteristically out of sorts today especially. Wenger looks genuinely tired and I don't know what that's about.   Gaddis has been really putting it all out there. Fernando has been putting a ton of effort in and hopefully that continues and begins to pay dividends that result in 3 points like it should've in the first two games. Though we had no reason to bring in Casey off the bench late, he's been pretty good in that role so I hope to see that continue as well.   Edu looked good. Ayuk, as green as he is, looks like a baller and is hungry for more minutes, so that's good.   Dallas could very well be the best team in the league so seeing our first loss, as ugly as it was, against them and with only 10 men, so be it. Hopefully we can build some confidence against Chicago next week and go from there."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,bmangan,3,Sat Mar 21 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"I completely and 1000% agree. Having had a few minutes to calm down. I feel like most of the pieces are there, it's just a matter of putting them together, issues at LB notwithstanding. We're not playing as a cohesive unit. We're not supporter's shield talented but we should at least be winning some games and occasionally punching above our weight. The team didn't look too bad up until the red. After the red it looked like someone the air out of a balloon and the team sure played like they were a balloon bouncing off the walls as all the air escaped."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,thewizardofosmium,2,Sat Mar 21 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"We don't have an owner as wealthy as many teams, so when something goes wrong with a player at certain positions, we really really feel it. That sucks. It would be nice if we had more depth. But I'd rather us get our weird injury issues out of the way in the first month of the season than during a playoff run in September."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,in_the_against,6,Sat Mar 21 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"In other news next week is officially ""we have to beat Chicago week..."""
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,SirMothy,9,Sat Mar 21 22:27:56 2015 UTC,"First half they weren't terrible, they had decent possession and made some chances. Then pfeffer got the red and everything devolved. The ref was awful as usual, MLS really needs to address this.  Letoux and white had a horrible passing game, constant give aways. Finishing was non existant as usual. Ayuk showed some refreshing skill on the ball in his first outing.  I think with 11 men we would have had a very real shot at winning."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,LocksTheFox,3,Sat Mar 21 22:14:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say we were the better team up until Sheannons injury at least but probably even still up to the red. The red ruined any hope of our passing game being succesful. That's just how it goes after that kind of play.   Realistically though, Pfeffer looked useful while he was in. The red didn't look as intentional as everyone made it sound. Definitely reckless, but he's off balance enough and doesn't have a track record of being stupid enough for me to assume he'd do that on purpose.  Ayuk looked promising in his short time on the field. I would've liked to see some of Catic if we had another sub at the end of the game.   In the time we have had 11 on the field we've looked better in all of our games so far. It hasn't fallen for us yet, but they're playing quality soccer and that'll add up over the course of the season."

PhillyUnion,2zuh92,bmangan,3,Sat Mar 21 22:35:04 2015 UTC,He insists it was
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,LocksTheFox,3,Sat Mar 21 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"It looked accidental from where I was too. But looking at the replay, even if it was accidental, that's a straight red no doubt."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,akuller,-1,Sun Mar 22 02:38:33 2015 UTC,I was sitting not far from where it occurred and having just watched the replay it shouldn't have even been a yellow. I was watching Curtin talking to the 4th official he was livid.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,drewuke,9,Sat Mar 21 22:46:12 2015 UTC,If elbowing someone in the head at full speed doesn't deserve a red then I don't know what would.  It was just plain awful.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,akuller,4,Sun Mar 22 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yea intentional or not, and I'm leaning heavily towards not here, it's still reckless to have your elbow that high. You can even see he slips as he goes into Diaz, but a yellow would have been getting off light."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,drewuke,3,Sun Mar 22 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"Curtin said 4th official, who was closer, said yellow"
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,akuller,3,Sat Mar 21 22:47:18 2015 UTC,yea 4th official seemed apologetic.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,drewuke,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:10:31 2015 UTC,I didn't think Pfeffer was ever going to leave the field.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,akuller,-2,Sun Mar 22 04:17:40 2015 UTC,he shouldn't have had to
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,Pretzy86,5,Sun Mar 22 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"Eh, it didn't look too bad live, but it looked vicious on the replay. Pretty clear red."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,EdBacon,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:37:21 2015 UTC,dude lowered his head and his elbow was not nearly that high he isn't that tall
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,rabidfrodo,3,Sun Mar 22 04:41:49 2015 UTC,"Uh dude, Pfeffer is an inch taller than Diaz."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,jpoRS,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:44:58 2015 UTC,diaz still ducked his head I was more comparing pfeffrs size to a le toux or nando.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,zhamdee,3,Sun Mar 22 12:17:28 2015 UTC,"It was reckless, maybe not intentional, but red card worthy.  It was a bone head move on pfeffers part."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,marble617,5,Sun Mar 22 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"We need a real LB so badly. So much of our lineup devolves over that position.  Wenger was naturally a defender, and he's just... not got much going forward so far this year. I honestly wonder if placing him at LB and Gaddis at RB could be any worse for us than what we're already doing."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,truckloadof4skin,2,Sat Mar 21 22:25:40 2015 UTC,Late to the party here but that have came down to a few bad plays. I don't know if Pfeffer deserved red but it's to close to say. Doubt he meant it either. He was playing well though.  Fabinho should have never been protected we should have given into whoever wanted to sign him. He was the culprit in many of Dallas attacks. Williams is still good he was hurt while playing when he came off he went right to the lockerroom.  M'Bohli should get benched when Blake returns. The first goal he didn't make any attempt to cut down the angle. If you can't make it to the ball you can't sit that deep without knowing your gifting the striker a goal. The second one I can't believe the guy didn't get a hand to it. It was slow and not that far away.  White and Le Toux look lost. Neither were positionally aware yesterday. White was again nervous on the ball and panicked it seemed deep in our zone. As for Le Toux he has seemingly forgot the need for defense making runs everywhere but never tracking back to help Gaddis who was marking Dallas' best player.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,MrChips217,2,Sun Mar 22 12:19:29 2015 UTC,"We can take some solace in the fact that The Union have yet to face an East team. That means that dropped points have not been picked up by anyone we will be in direct competition with. And if you take a deep swig of the Kool Aid, the West is supposed to be better, so losing to them isn't so significant."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,Keepa1,4,Sun Mar 22 13:15:06 2015 UTC,Le Toux looks like he doesn't even want to be out there
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,thelostdolphin,2,Sat Mar 21 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he looked really frustrated in the 2nd half. Especially when he threw the ball at Dias's chest near the end"

PhillyUnion,2zuh92,thelostdolphin,2,Sat Mar 21 22:06:37 2015 UTC,This would be a perfect union mascot...someone get nick sak on the wire
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,Invas10n,3,Sat Mar 21 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"The U is 3/3 for me in terms of crushing my hopes and being an utter disappointment. 2nd time we've failed to score at home. Pfeffer is an asshole. Le toux is shit. Fabinho is even shittier, although I credit Curtin for being proactive- 20 minutes in Seanon was already beaten 5 times by Castillo. Guess our entire season hinges on Maidanas health."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,LocksTheFox,4,Sat Mar 21 22:48:02 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Williams pulled a hamstring so the reason he was getting beat was because of that and it finally reached the point where he had to sub out. It was less Curtin being proactive as much as Williams communicating that he had to get out of there.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,dooper2010,3,Sat Mar 21 22:51:59 2015 UTC,I'd put $ on Castillo beating a healthy Williams too.  He was very quick today.  Europe's in his future.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,truckloadof4skin,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:12:13 2015 UTC,Oh no question. Him trying to stay even somewhat near him is probably what caused the muscle pull. And the condition of the field probably didn't help.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:50:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't think we played too bad. Before the red card, philly was dominating the game, then fabinho's mistake killed us, but overall we didn't play terrible."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,truckloadof4skin,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:24:53 2015 UTC,I think Fabinho fucking up was responsible more for the result than Pfeffer seeing red
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,LocksTheFox,2,Sun Mar 22 00:30:47 2015 UTC,"True - always have to keep in mind when a controversial red card is given early, especially against the home team, the ref may feel the need to make up for it later.  If it had still been 0-0 and Dallas gets a red (several guys were on yellows) it's a brand new game 10v10"
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,dooper2010,2,Sun Mar 22 02:07:18 2015 UTC,yeah he did it more then once as well. Fabhino could of been personally responsible like 3 goals if Dallas could finish.
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,phancypheetz,2,Sun Mar 22 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"He was so, so bad.  The only bright spots: Fernando's work ethic, Gaddis, and Ayuk. That kid's got SKILLS"
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah ayuk was out there trying to prove something.  I thought Nog's and edu played alrite as well.   It hurts to say, but we need to get le toux out of the starting 11."
PhillyUnion,2zuh92,FlapjackJackson,3,Sun Mar 22 02:43:36 2015 UTC,Le Toux seemed really out of character today =\

PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,Wh3resTh3Beef,2,Sat Mar 21 21:19:41 2015 UTC,*sigh*  I blame Pfeffer for everything.
PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:26:34 2015 UTC,Why so many cards?
PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,cf_wyeth,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:17:10 2015 UTC,I was excited for Pfeffer to start and this is how he repays me.  Bonehead move.
PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,Incara1010,2,Sat Mar 21 20:54:10 2015 UTC,From section 123 that looked pretty unintentional. This ref has no control over this game already. There have been way too many cards.
PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,markd248,5,Sat Mar 21 21:01:07 2015 UTC,"From replay, it looked very intentional. Just a bad, bad play all around."
PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,flyersfan1493,3,Sat Mar 21 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"at first look, it didn't seem to be intentional but the replay absolutely justifies the refs decision. Just an immature decision on pfeffers part"
PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,FlashKelly,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yup - in real time it looked a yellow card foul at worst. After seeing the replay, the referee was totally justified in giving a red."
PhillyUnion,2zu5vn,4-1-3-2,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"That doesn't surprise me, I was thinking to myself if I was at the game I'd be booing my heart out. But there was really no reason to put his elbow up with such force. It looks quite intentional, but obviously it's a matter of opinion.   And I agree, too many cards."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,Malaria_is_bad,5,Sun Mar 22 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"Because a guy who can't beat out Clint Irwin for a starting job will save us, when goalkeeping isn't that bad of a problem. Right."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:42:48 2015 UTC,As a fan starting last year I feel I am missing your point.  Please pm me or comment here.  Just unclear
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:09:12 2015 UTC,"MacMath was loaned to Colorado to compete for the #1 job with Clint Irwin, who posted a 1.89 GAA, the worst of any starting keeper in MLS.  Preseason comes and MacMath plays 2 matches at the Desert Diamond Cup, giving up 2 goals within a minute to draw SKC, then shutting out FC Tucson - not an accomplishment given that FCT is in fact a PDL side. Irwin played against New England and RSL, drawing 1-1 and losing 2-1.  Irwin started the opener against us because of loan rules, and also got the nod today, and snagged a clean sheet against NYCFC. So, unless he goes down with an injury, looks like MacMath is inferior to the worst starting keeper in MLS last year  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,funkyquasar,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:19:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, GAA is a flawed stat, considering Colorado's back line was absolutely putrid in the latter part of last year. SV% is a little bit better in terms of a goalkeeper's actual performance, and his SV% of 58.4% was....  second worst behind Tally Hall (58.3%). Yeah, maybe he's not good.  MacMath's SV% was 61.6%, FWIW."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,MrChips217,4,Sun Mar 22 14:17:12 2015 UTC,Do you really think MacMath is better than M'Bohli?  Edit: I felt I came off a bit harsh no need for that vibe
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,akuller,-2,Sun Mar 22 03:24:31 2015 UTC,100% Zac is better than the choke artist known as M'Bohli
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:02:13 2015 UTC,"Choke artist, you say?  cough cough  EDIT: Oh yeah and he also gave up two goals within a minute in the preseason against SKC with Colorado leading 2-0. Result was a 2-2 draw."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,thanksbastards,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"listen man, this is no place for solid evidence and logic. clearly M'Bohli is terrible because we've hated him before he even put on the shirt...  every time the FO claims the Union fan base is ""knowledgeable"" I feel like they have to be holding a chuckle back."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, part of my liking of M'Bolhi is because he gets so much poison from the fanbase for something that wasn't his fault"
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,thanksbastards,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:16:22 2015 UTC,Ha. That's the only reason I liked Ruiz as much as I did.
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,FlapjackJackson,-1,Sun Mar 22 21:18:58 2015 UTC,Hey having an opinion isn't popular.   But for me MacMath  could have saved this game...
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:44:34 2015 UTC,"How? Would he have stopped Pfeffer from getting a red? Would he have kept Fabinho from kicking it off a defender? Would he have somehow improved Seba's touch?  MBolhi wasn't to blame for either goal. If he came out for the first, the attacker would have beat him, and he would have gotten the red. The second goal was in no way his fault."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,drewuke,3,Mon Mar 23 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"M'Bohli could score a hatrick, buy us a left-back, get DOOP tatted on his face and give out free beer at every game and people would STILL find a way to hate on him.  Just stop already!"
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,FlapjackJackson,3,Sun Mar 22 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, we really need that 4th goalie."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,midwesternhousewives,-1,Sun Mar 22 04:13:23 2015 UTC,Or one who understands the ball stops here.
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:06:33 2015 UTC,The only place MacMath understands the ball stops is in the back of the net.
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Mar 23 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Rais was the problem this game, at all.  First off, FC Dallas is a pretty strong team.  Couple that with the fact we were down 10 men.  Even so he had some great saves, and the 2 goals were both defender error, not Rais."
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,FlapjackJackson,-2,Sun Mar 22 04:37:20 2015 UTC,Just my opinion but I do believe Macmath to be a better GK.  I do see the fault in the defense letting it get to that point but ultimately the GK is the final stop and I have seen MacMath save games like today and the last 2
PhillyUnion,2zvcg5,4-1-3-2,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:42:32 2015 UTC,"what do you mean by being able to ""save games""?  if we don't score theres nothing he can do"

PhillyUnion,2zugil,B4kstabr,7,Sat Mar 21 21:58:12 2015 UTC,The ref today was the least of our problems.
PhillyUnion,2zugil,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:02:02 2015 UTC,Agreed but it hurts momentum and absolutely kills us when calls are inconsistent and at the wrong time
PhillyUnion,2zugil,Mountainhawk98,3,Sat Mar 21 22:05:23 2015 UTC,"This better not be about the red.  Because that was amazing stupidity by Zach, not the refs."
PhillyUnion,2zugil,Mountainhawk98,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:37:31 2015 UTC,"No the red was all Zach.  That is not what im angry about.. I am angry about the 2 missed calls on our guys getting dragged down, one in the box by the 2 Fcdefenders early on and then Gaddis getting taken down near the end.  I am angry about the stupid calls pushing up back to take a throw in but then Fcdallas just halfway up the field.  I am angry at the Yellow on Le Toux when the Dallas defender had his arm wrapped around him and dragged him down.  The team did not play anywhere near good, but dammit we can't keep momentum or any kind of attack when we get no fouls on obvious plays."

PhillyUnion,2zpwfi,M4_doop,0,Fri Mar 20 17:43:36 2015 UTC,As opposed to a half empty stadium tomorrow from people who can't make it on the different day...
PhillyUnion,2zpwfi,Syaoran89,3,Fri Mar 20 18:42:51 2015 UTC,A majority of the matches normally happen on Sat/Sun. I think they'll do a lot better tomorrow attendance-wise than they would have today.

PhillyUnion,2zpwfi,Syaoran89,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:59:29 2015 UTC,Alot of people were giving away their tickets or selling them for cheap for tonights game.

This past year I moved to Baltimore for work, and my schedule doesn't make it real convenient to make games. But I renewed anyway, thinking it wasn't that far and for the love of DOOP I would do my best to make it. I took off for the game tonight. I can't make it tomorrow.  If you're gonna postpone the game hours before kick off, how do you not offer refunds? How do you not offer some kind of make good to your fans? If this is the kind of stuff they're gonna pull with mildly inconvenient weather, then I'm gonna consider not re-upping my tickets next year because it's hard enough as is, much less when you start pulling BS like this.  EDIT: Just talked to my ticket rep. Apparently this was a LEAGUE decision, not Union. Also, if you're a STH, they're giving extra tickets to a future game instead of a refund for the trouble.

I made it really clear I was upset with the fact the game was rescheduled so quickly and it gives people no time that work on the weekends or are otherwise engaged or don't live life by the seat of the pants to make arrangements to come.   I hope I hear back about some freebies or something.

PhillyUnion,2zqsna,dseid,3,Fri Mar 20 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"I would advise driving if you are willing to pay the $20 parking fee. I'm not sure how septa to the stadium works but I think it's something like you get off the train in Chester and hop on a bus to the stadium. I know they've been working on improving that system a lot to encourage people to use it. Once you're there, a lot of people tailgate by their cars and I'm sure it will packed tmrw with the nice weather. If you know anyone, I'd do that. If not, the sons of ben tailgate is on the way into the stadium on your right, you can't miss it. It's $8 for food OR drinks, and $15 for both. Bearfight is another group that does a pretty good tailgate, idk how the pricing works but they get really drunk, really fast. Most people are extremely friendly during the tailgate because the union haven't tied yet, so if you go up to a big group and say hello, 9/10 will invite you to join in, mine included. Cheers!"

I have never had a problem with the shuttle being there when getting off the train, I'm usually there a few hours early. The line to get on the shuttles leaving the stadium can be long.

PhillyUnion,2zpymx,LocksTheFox,3,Fri Mar 20 17:37:54 2015 UTC,The game should have been played today (3/20) vs The postponing of the game was a good idea (3/21). Lets hear the opinions.
PhillyUnion,2zpymx,ChicoSam21,3,Fri Mar 20 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"While it was a good idea to postpone the game, it kinda sucks that no refunds were offered. Or even exchanges for that matter. Some people can't make tomorrow so I would think that maybe they would at least do something."
PhillyUnion,2zpymx,get_down_mrpresident,2,Fri Mar 20 18:50:38 2015 UTC,Eh I'm indifferent honestly. I would've loved to have seen it played today but I think playing it tomorrow is best for overall performance  and better for the fans.

I haven't checked in two or three years so it might have changed, and also maybe it was just that specific game and the cups they were using, or an inattentive pourer... but with the qualifiers out of the way.  There is no difference between a regular and a large in terms of how much beer you get.  The regular is a shorter but wider cup, while the large is a taller but more narrow cup.    I had bought a large and a regular beer, Budweiser maybe.  I drank the large first then poured the regular into the empty large cup and it filled up to the exact same level that the large was originally filled up to.  So not exactly a scientific study, but it was enough to convince me to never spend the extra money (like an extra $3?) on a large if I'm not getting extra value out of it."

PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,MrChips217,5,Thu Mar 19 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"I never held that trade against Hackworth, I actually think he has/had a good eye for acquiring talent. What I held against Hackworth was how bad the tactics were, the lack of consistency in the starting 11, that and the lack of urgency to win anything that lead to perpetual rebuilding years. At times it seemed like Hackworth had favorite players he'd play over people who were clearly more talented out of some bizarre need to punish people like Chaco Maidana (And we lost games where he sat better players). All of that plus his attitude in press conferences.... He had to go."
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,KFCConspiracy,4,Fri Mar 20 13:10:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't know anything about Wenger when we got him, but Jack Mac really only played well for a half of a season in Philly. I know he's a poacher type but he isn't good on the ball at all. So, yeah, I'm really happy that Wenger has turned out to be a productive player who has the potential to get even better."
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,9guy,2,Thu Mar 19 22:38:36 2015 UTC,Not to be that guy but Wenger only has been good for half a season too. While I don't expect him to have a dip this year I feel like we are all forgetting he struggled before Curtin put him out wide.
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,rabidfrodo,2,Fri Mar 20 10:00:29 2015 UTC,Everyone struggles when they aren't playing in the position they are best suited for. He had to find his role in the team and now that he has he's been great.
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,mthslhrookiecard,7,Fri Mar 20 12:02:02 2015 UTC,It's easier to replace someone with Jack's skill set than it is to replace someone with Andrew's.
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,funkyquasar,10,Thu Mar 19 22:22:00 2015 UTC,This. Jack's a one-trick pony - poach poach poach. Wenger has way more in his arsenal.
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,LocksTheFox,2,Thu Mar 19 22:58:22 2015 UTC,And to read the things that were said about Wenger when he was in college really gives some perspective here. He was number one pick for a good reason and they didn't even know what position he would play.
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,bmangan,3,Thu Mar 19 23:12:13 2015 UTC,Well this is awkward...
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,brain_smart,2,Fri Mar 20 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"I was right there with you, all though apparently not in that thread.  On McInerney-Wenger Trade:   I'm more than OK with this move, I think it's a really smart trade to make.  ...  So, trade Jack for a striker with a longer contract that fits your system better. I see that as a win. My only complaint is that Hack couldn't get allocation or draft picks out of this.   And I can't find the thread/comment but I remember ranting a few times about how Jack's off the ball movement was incredibly overrated. People always raved about his movement, but the vast majority of the time he would just make a vertical run towards goal wanting some incredible ball over the top of the centerbacks.  He rarely checked-to to receive the ball and rarely made the diagonal run into open space. That's what I found most frustrating about him."
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,Dean_Moriarty,2,Fri Mar 20 15:59:35 2015 UTC,That whole thread is full of people just jamming their feet so far down their throat.
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,jpoRS,3,Sun Mar 22 13:26:19 2015 UTC,"I'll eat crow. I was pissed about this trade and thought Wenger would amount to nothing. Curtin playing him as a target winger completely revitalized him, and let us hose Montreal in that trade."
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,FlapjackJackson,3,Fri Mar 20 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"I was on TeamWenger from the day the trade happened, although I will admit the trade is still fairly young.    I think Wenger found his role at LW which has helped him and the Union a lot so far.  But there is still plenty of time for Jack to develop and find out how to best help the Impact that could change things.  I think it is Eli from the PhillySoccerShow who says it a lot but the best thing the Union could do to help Wenger is to get a left back. Someone who can overlap Wenger and be a real threat getting forward.  Right now teams can just force him outside and not let him cut into the middle because Gaddis doesn't really pose a threat."
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,Dean_Moriarty,2,Fri Mar 20 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I wasn't real wild about the trade when it happened since it left us thin at forward last year and may (don't twist this, I only said ""may"") have cost us a spot in the playoffs.  However, when Wenger broke out mid-season it became apparent we were probably getting the better end of the deal in all respects I can see.  Looking like Arista will fill the forward hole well, so losing Jack not a longer term issue.  Never know as things could reverse course again and Jack could get hot and Wenger fizzle (hope not!)."
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,dooper2010,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:42:15 2015 UTC,I think Wenger is a far more complete player but I find him equally frustrating as Jack. He's so talented and physically dominating but doesn't get involved or affect games as nearly as much as he should. He was probably the best player in college in three positions and watching games pass him by on the left wing is so frustrating. He should be tearing teams up.
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,Guidosama,0,Fri Mar 20 13:20:51 2015 UTC,Can you expand on the lack of motivation?
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,solprose315,3,Fri Mar 20 05:32:05 2015 UTC,he was always moping around the field..
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,timofree,2,Fri Mar 20 07:16:24 2015 UTC,"Last year he wasn't running back to defend, every time he'd screw up a touch or miss a goal he'd throw his hands up in the air and make faces like a little child. And he when he'd go forward on attack, his pace was kind of slow."
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"I just never really saw him run at all in the Pachuka game, he was just kind of jogging around the pitch"
PhillyUnion,2zmm1n,goatyhead,2,Fri Mar 20 10:57:49 2015 UTC,Isn't that what poachers do though?   I still thought he was a bit petulant anyway so given his precipitous drop in scoring I wasn't too upset to see him go.

PhillyUnion,2zn036,TomCosella,2,Fri Mar 20 13:13:05 2015 UTC,"People figured him out.   Yeah I think this is it.  I was fairly high on Hop his first year.  I was going to say that he's regressed, but I think it's more that people have figured him out and he hasn't progressed in his game enough.  I still like his abilities to take on guys on the dribble, but the rest of his skills haven't developed that realistically the best we can hope for when he tries to beat his guy is that he gets fouled.  I think the only reason he is still on the team is his contract is probably reasonable and we really don't have anyone else who is pacey and can take on guys.  But I'd assumed this is his last year if he doesn't improve, we need more out of a guy like that."
PhillyUnion,2zn036,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%, but what I want to know is: why is he still even on the roster? His role on the team has always been ""super sub"" striker, but that reputation only lasted a season, and since then he's been the definition of ineffective. Additionally, we have more than enough offensive options now, so there's no real need to have him on the roster anymore. We're pretty much just throwing money away at this point.. Agree?"

PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, random question, but is that a weather app on your phone or something on your desktop?"
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,MrChips217,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:11:34 2015 UTC,Some website I found maybe weather.con
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, haha. It looked kinda cool. I thought maybe it was a phone app."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,crylicylon,2,Thu Mar 19 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"I like Wunderground's app, if you are looking for a suggestion."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Mar 19 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"Haven't used that. I've been using Weather Timeline (Android) and like it, but I have a weird addiction to buying weather apps, so I'll check it out."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,Keepa1,3,Thu Mar 19 17:29:09 2015 UTC,I have a weird addiction to buying weather apps   No one would have guessed why Fred's wife really left him that day..
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,6,Thu Mar 19 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not the one with the problem, Diane. You're the problem. Maybe if you satisfied me the way these Doppler radar animations did, I wouldn't have had to re-mortgage the house to pay for these apps."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,goatyhead,2,Thu Mar 19 21:45:08 2015 UTC,just. magnificent.
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,3,Fri Mar 20 13:06:24 2015 UTC,"Le Toux and Wenger so far this season have been less than stellar and with Maidana out and Fernando, as great as he's been, still a new piece of the puzzle, I hope to see those two step it up this game. Our defense is really going to be tested with the combo of Blaz, Castillo, and Diaz, so we're likely going to need some goals to stay alive and those two need to be more involved to get them."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,OshiHidra,3,Thu Mar 19 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's still going to be snowing during the game. If so, the hail of snowballs at the refs if they fuck up AGAIN is going to be a sight to behold."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,Keepa1,5,Fri Mar 20 04:42:46 2015 UTC,a new high in Philadelphia fandom.

PhillyUnion,2zlaft,keystonemike,2,Fri Mar 20 17:24:35 2015 UTC,I think I'd like to see McLaughlin replace Le Toux for a game. We need to hold the ball more against Dallas... Le Toux has been absolutely killing us in that regard. Or if we go 4-4-2 with Pfeffer wide?
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,6,Thu Mar 19 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"While I understand your reasoning, I think the statement that move would send to the team (obviously most especially to Seba), making that drastic a change in only Week 3, would do more harm than whatever positive rolling the dice in that regard might do in this one game. Nothing against McLaughlin, but that's a move of panic and desperation, not of a team with two draws that could easily have been wins, and a ton more games to play.   If Le Toux is really off his game, then maybe a substitution at some point, but not to bench him after two games. If anything, Wenger has been the biggest dud so far this season. He was so nonexistent last game you would've thought we were playing with a man down. However, I wouldn't bench him either because I think both of them will pull it together and be more effective. Hopefully that happens tomorrow."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,keystonemike,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:36:03 2015 UTC,Which is why I was also thinking: What if they went with Wenger as a  second striker in a 4-4-2 and used either Pfeffer or McLaughlin as the LM?
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"Not that it couldn't work, but I think Curtin is so confident in Pfeffer that he's just going to slot him in for Maidana and play the same formation as last week. We have yet to concede a goal due to dispossession and I think he really does feel like we should have 6 points going into this game and therefore we should play like we do. I do hope to see more of the young guys though this season, specifically McLaughlin, Catic, and Ayuk."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,keystonemike,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as conceding because of dispossession... we played two shit teams. (Yes, RSL looked terrible.) FCD is not.  I'm ok with just slotting in Pfeffer, but only because each alternate is equally risky, albeit for different reasons..."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely hear you. I think Dallas is potentially better than LA and Seattle this year. This will definitely be quite the test. Guys like Sheanon and Ethan White are going to have to really step up their games and Gaddis, while always giving it 110%, is going to need to do better in his positioning. Should be interesting.."
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,keystonemike,2,Thu Mar 19 21:25:11 2015 UTC,To reply to myself: I guess my thought is that Pfeffer-for-Chaco still allows Le Toux and Wenger to turn the ball over quickly. That is a death sentence against Castillo's ability to get upfield and Diaz's ability to play a long diagonal ball to him or Tesho. Combined with Perez flopping like a fish on the wet pitch and Michel dead balls... We need some possession.
PhillyUnion,2zlaft,Keepa1,2,Thu Mar 19 19:20:46 2015 UTC,Can someone make a match thread in /r/MLS please? /u/LocksTheFox ?

PhillyUnion,2zkw06,oestre24,3,Thu Mar 19 13:07:18 2015 UTC,Honestly man....I would love to take them from ya.  I had to reduce the number of games I could go to this year because I jut moved into a new house with a buddy of mine and thus had to ration out my money more than I wanted too.  How many tickets are there because I know a few folks I could probably take with me and I LOVE the cold.
PhillyUnion,2zkw06,B4kstabr,3,Thu Mar 19 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I have 2 tickets."
PhillyUnion,2zkw06,B4kstabr,6,Thu Mar 19 15:01:27 2015 UTC,Dude you have nothing to be sorry about.  As a fellow Delawarean I will make it our sworn duty to uphold the amount of folks from the Blue and Gold state to be there.
PhillyUnion,2zkw06,TJunior1014,6,Thu Mar 19 15:03:56 2015 UTC,"So far you are leading a very thin, one might say nonexistent pack of applicants."

PhillyUnion,2zkw06,goatyhead,9,Fri Mar 20 00:25:51 2015 UTC,its a still a kind gesture in an effort to not let them go to waste...$9 or not I don't see you offering anything on here for free.
PhillyUnion,2zkw06,rabidfrodo,10,Thu Mar 19 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"Actually the lowest price on Stubhub for section 129 is $25.  I have no idea what ""neck bearded bro"" means."
PhillyUnion,2zkw06,keystonemike,5,Thu Mar 19 15:24:10 2015 UTC,Either way man if you save someone $9 you are letting them buy one more beer. You're doing good work.

They resumed play in both of them after a delay."

PhillyUnion,2zhr62,FlapjackJackson,2,Wed Mar 18 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"With young players, I feel that there is usually a period of transition from loan spell to actual first team minutes where they ride the bench for a while and are slowly eased into the squad. I'd give about a month til we see Jimmy get some actual playing time but I would love to be wrong about this and see him sooner. Nice write up"
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,darkhorseswag,12,Wed Mar 18 15:57:12 2015 UTC,I personally hope for a straight swap with Pfeffer coming on for the injured Chaco.
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,get_down_mrpresident,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"With RSL off this week, my fantasy team needs pfeffer in! Also I would love to see the kid get a start after what Jim said about him during preseason. If he really was challenging Chaco for the starting job, then there is no reason a straight swap wouldn't be the best call."
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,emptythecache,4,Wed Mar 18 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"With Sapong also hurt, the next guy into the starting lineup has to be Pfeffer, Casey, or Catic. Pfeffer seems the obvious choice.  edit: unless Curtin does something dumb like starting Fred, or pushing Vince up into the #10 role, and starting Lahoud."
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:11:20 2015 UTC,Can't see Curtin wanting Casey playing 70+ mins and I think he'll view Catic as too raw at this point to consider giving him a start.
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,jd158ug,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"That would be logical, captain."
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,LocksTheFox,3,Thu Mar 19 00:17:19 2015 UTC,"Pfeffer in the XI, Jimmy Mac and Hoppenot (knowing that Curtin is trying to repurpose him as a pacey winger) in the 18."
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,EdBacon,2,Wed Mar 18 16:15:15 2015 UTC,"No Sapong either so probably no 4-4-2.  Maybe a straight swap for Pfeffer? With Dallas coming this could be a really tough game. There's the possibility Curtin keeps the kids to the bench if he tries for an older lineup, maybe to play for the draw."
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,ChefJim27,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"Pfeffer deserves a start. For no other reason than he's second on the depth chart at CAM. He played well in preseason. With Chaco out, time to really see what the kid can do. This isn't Red Bull Away '11 after all."

The way we've been playing calls for a second true DM, but alas, we don't have one (Lahoud is garbage), so Williams seems like the next best option.  I'd also look for Wenger to play more inside, with Fabinho providing the extra width and Edu ready to cover behind him."
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,TheDuckyNinja,6,Wed Mar 18 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is quite the game to test 5 new positions. That sounds like a recipe for disaster. FCD is coming in hot, we need chemistry not an experiment."
PhillyUnion,2zh8hh,thelostdolphin,2,Wed Mar 18 19:13:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the only chemistry we've seen anywhere on the field in two games is between Maidana and Nando, and that chemistry is gone.  I don't think playing it safe is the way to go."
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,--smokeandmirrors--,10,Tue Mar 17 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with this. I don't dislike Danny Cruz, but I think he's just too far down our depth chart right now to be worth what we pay him. I'm also glad this probably means we see more of Pfeffer and McLaughlin."
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,emptythecache,3,Tue Mar 17 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"I think he is a good option off of the bench, but if we do get to see more McLaughlin then I'm all for it."
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,dekelly,5,Tue Mar 17 21:16:05 2015 UTC,Maybe this is what Kevin was talking about. Bit of a bummer I thought Danny was going to be good out wide this year.
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,rabidfrodo,3,Tue Mar 17 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I think this could benefit us.  I like Cruz, I think he has a solid work ethic and while he isn't the strongest player, he brings an energy to the field as a late sub.  But hopefully Danny gets some playing time where he would be sitting over here, or if he doesn't, he gets to train at a higher caliber and comes back stronger."
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,midwesternhousewives,4,Tue Mar 17 23:26:01 2015 UTC,Is that club truly higher quality?
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,akuller,3,Tue Mar 17 23:47:36 2015 UTC,"Probably doesn't matter, as long as he gets more consistent play time and possibly more face time with a coach who may have a different perspective to work on his game."
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,KFCConspiracy,3,Wed Mar 18 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's the same argument for Americans like Jozy, Bradley, or Dempsey coming home. Maybe the league isn't as good, but if he gets more playing time it's a good move."
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,jpoRS,3,Wed Mar 18 20:55:54 2015 UTC,I like the cap relief but it thins up our already weak wing depth

He might not be good, but he is a beautiful bundle of pure chaos that is entertaining as hell to watch. Good thing I left my wallet in the car and didn't put his name on the back of my jersey during the home opener."
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,FlapjackJackson,2,Tue Mar 17 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel about Hoppenot. His super sub antics of 2012 and '13 was what made him my favorite union player at the time. Pace, chaos, and the ability to infuriate tired defenses is fun to watch.  Also,he did draw the foul for that 95th minute Kleberson FK vs Toronto."

PhillyUnion,2ze75c,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:09:59 2015 UTC,I'm completely fine with this. Maybe Danny will learn how some basic ball control over there.
PhillyUnion,2ze75c,Keepa1,0,Tue Mar 17 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"Something I've never thought about - generally a loan just means the new team pays his wages as determined by his contract with the pre-existing team. So really, Danny's taking a massive pay-cut to live in a country where it costs $9 for a gallon of gas and $4 for a coke. I guess it doesn't matter for players making $8,000 a week, but for lower tier MLS players, I can see how this might feel like a hit."

PhillyUnion,2zeeir,funkyquasar,3,Tue Mar 17 22:11:19 2015 UTC,The truth is that the 4-4-2 actually kinda makes sense anyways considering we're playing Dallas and the weather will be absolute shit.  Couple that with Curtin's defensive nature and I think we'll see a 4-4-2 for at least part of the match.
PhillyUnion,2zeeir,xxtoejamfootballxx,3,Wed Mar 18 16:04:29 2015 UTC,FFFFFFFFFFF  Gonna be a tough game against Dallas.

It's always something. It's either he's not in condition or he gets hurt and it's getting old. I'm not saying he's not legitimately hurt but it's always something. Le Toux and Wenger better step it up they should have worked out the scoring drama before playing actual games. That is also getting old!"

You will only receive the audio option that you selected if the program provider is sending that language with their programming.

Anything I've ever had issues with is small and is due to us being different people. Just trying to see what everyone's perspective is and how they interact.

I remember when the group had like 5 officers, but that was in charge of like 50 members, and all the efforts and actions made were more towards UPenn soccer tailgates or USMNT roadtrips.  As soon as the original leaders moved away from their positions, I lost interest in anyone who replaced them. Didn't know them personally so I had no reason to vote. As long as the group would continue along with our MLS team, that's all I cared for. Also lost the interest of the official tailgate each game. I'm sorta cheap, plus I have another group I like gathering with."

PhillyUnion,2zabrv,Keepa1,2,Tue Mar 17 00:44:46 2015 UTC,"New member this year. Would have loved to see the letter broader than just the crap calls that have robbed us of four points, cause lord knows there's plenty to complain about officiating-wise, but I don't think the letter is a terrible idea. Will that alone fix it? Nope, but if no one complains, nothing changes. These calls are actually changing outcomes of games and tilting the playing field, someone needs to raise a stink about it, and at least this is something.  It wasn't perfect, but I'm still for it."

So instead of 1 qualifier like last year, this year we have to go 3. 3 games, just to get INTO the cup. We've already won 2, and now we have to fly our SoCal asses all the way up to fucking Seattle to play against a team who is playing their 2nd game, EVER, as a team. Why the hell they chose to make us travel over them? I have no earthly idea. But we're heading up there on Saturday, hopefully to kick some ass. and as for our home stadium, we currently don't have one. I have no idea what the ownership is doing, i imagine they're just taking their time to lock down a good central site because our regular season doesn't start for another few weeks. But for our last 2 games, we've played at two different sites.  The San Diego perennial search for a home, and a USOC win continues! stay tuned..."

I heard there were changes in qualifying this year, but dear lord...f it, so far as I'm concerned, you guys have won two official matches already! I mean, had you lost either of them, you would've been out of the tournament, right?  As for finding a perma home, best of luck on the search. I know nothing about your ownership group, but can't imagine how frustrating it's been.  Also, you know what, fuck it, I'm ordering a Flash scarf right now. I know it'll be a trivial amount ($15), but I guess more of a symbolic gesture to support you guys. Good luck on Saturday!!"
PhillyUnion,2zabrv,Edeuinu,2,Tue Mar 17 02:49:20 2015 UTC,"Ya our ownership is really out of sync since our founder and CEO passed away a few weeks ago. It was pretty unexpected and it's been hard moving forward.   If you buy a scarf, I'll see if i can get you another goodie for free. Thanks for the support, it means a lot :)."

PhillyUnion,2zabrv,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:42:01 2015 UTC,I'm not simply because of the fact that I don't feel I go to enough games to justify it.  Especially since most of the year the Union aren't even the nearest team to me (Montreal is)

PhillyUnion,2zaelt,peewoah1,5,Tue Mar 17 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"Last year we nearly won the US Open Cup which is sort of the March Madness like tournament that all levels of soccer participate in. We barely lost to Seattle who had a deeper team than us. In the league we barely missed out on the playoffs due to a late season collapse.  In the offseason the team has added new players in positions of weakness while still holding onto most of the team from last year. Jim Curtin was retained as the head coach and so far has the team playing well and seems to have their belief.  The additions in the squad were: Fernando Aristeguieta a striker on loan from Nantes, the team Alejandro Bedoya plays for. He has started both games this year and looked very good. He is young as well which is good if the team can sign him long term.  Stephen Vitoria a Canadian Centerback on loan from Portugal. He has looked pretty good so far this season if a little slow. He has the potential to settle the back line and add veteran presence.  Edu, while technically he was on the team last year he now is no longer on loan. He is moved to the midfield teaming up with Nogueira.  CJ Sapong arrived in a trade from Sporting KC. He adds depth and versatility up front with the ability to play wide or up top as a CF. He was hurt in the first game of the season though.  Overall the team looks good playing a 4-2-3-1 against Real Salt Lake. I think most people would say that a playoff birth should be expected from this team."

He's shown flashes of being the poacher we need and shown flashes of being the target man we need.   He looks really out of shape though. I'm not sure if that's a positive or a negative though. If he gets fitter and can move more freely he'd probably look more dangerous."
PhillyUnion,2z8mht,Mike81890,3,Mon Mar 16 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"I would say I'm on the hype-Duck Tour boat/tank.   I'm really impressed with how physical he is. Many times you see an adjustment period when a player used to European leagues comes over to MLS, but that has not been the case at all for him.   I'm not too sure about his fitness. He's so scrappy and in all places at all times it seems that maybe he's wearing himself down or it just seems like he's out of shape because of the level of his efforts. I dunno. I'll have to look for that more during the next match."

PhillyUnion,2z8mht,leftyboy87,7,Mon Mar 16 15:50:54 2015 UTC,"Both of those goals were pure poacher goals, absolutely. Turns out they count the same as the pretty ones though, so I don't care that much.   My intent with this post was to be hyperbolic and funny, obviously the preseason doesn't mean that much, but I think Nando has a lot of potential in the MLS and I'm excited to see what he can do."
PhillyUnion,2z8mht,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:32:37 2015 UTC,I wonder if Catic and Nando up front could work out like a Dempsey Martians deal somehow...
PhillyUnion,2z8mht,spqr-king,2,Mon Mar 16 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"If by Dempsey Martins you mean score a bunch of goals, yes. If you mean their style of play probably not. I love the idea of those two young players getting chemistry together, but neither look like creative players like Dempsey and Martins. Those two are constantly setting each other up. Nando and Catic? I'm not sure they've got the passing skills to do that.   Then again, they're both young and I haven't seen very much of either. So, who knows?"
PhillyUnion,2z69ix,LocksTheFox,22,Sun Mar 15 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"This reads more as whiny crying over spilled milk rather than addressing the bigger issue since it is clearly a league-wide problem.

PhillyUnion,2z69ix,thanksbastards,25,Mon Mar 16 00:58:38 2015 UTC,This just makes us look petty and full of sour grapes.  I highly doubt the league doesn't know their refs aren't great and I doubt any open letter from a supporters group of a small market team is going to do anything about it.
PhillyUnion,2z69ix,MisterB_66,12,Mon Mar 16 00:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's a valid thing to write a letter about. We are the consumers of the league's services, we are entitled to make our priorities known.

PhillyUnion,2z69ix,emptythecache,3,Mon Mar 16 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. This.   Philly is far from the only team suffering from crap calls, and we benefit from them almost as often as we fall victim to them. Having a broader focus would have made this letter much more affective. Calling for support from the other supporter groups who aren't satisfied, noting other instances of bad calls against other teams and even ones that have been in our favor would have made us seem like we were actually concerned about a problem in the league and not just butt hurt about a few tough draws."

Sure, none of us is pleased with the call, and getting donked for 2 points in both of our games so far seems unlikely, but don't act like we're being persecuted.  The author's personal tweet sharing it to Garber says   ""Ignoring us will not bode well, I can assure you.""

PhillyUnion,2z69ix,flyersunion28,0,Mon Mar 16 20:51:16 2015 UTC,Great cause and much needed. I wonder if it'll actually get noticed by MLS. Hopefully other teams fan bases replicate to better guarantee a reaction
PhillyUnion,2z69ix,rabidfrodo,0,Mon Mar 16 12:44:04 2015 UTC,Agreed writing this letter shows more than just fans tweeting. It can get noticed by journalists and hopefully compel more than a cursory look at the state of refereeing in the league.

The bad reffing in the MLS is notorious, but only focusing on us and ignoring the bad calls against the teams we played as well just makes this whole thing disingenuous. It would have been better to focus instead on the whole of the first two weeks for MLS, there has been horrific quality reffing all over the league this year. Hope the SOB publisher of this letter doesn't hold is breath waiting for a response because they aren't going to get one."

Don't allow the politics of this game get to you, enjoy yelling ""Hey REFS SUCKONMYBALLS! "" with 18k other people.  We have a home, that is what we focus on....We have a stadium that isnt just some random college football pitch, we have in my opinion, one of the best damn situated stadiums of the league.

After all the bullshit we've had to put up with from Nowak to Sak to Hack, we're still going strong. I'd argue that this is the best team we've seen so far in blue so fuck Orlando, NY, and Montreal. Even with their DPs and media attention, I'd bet on the U any day of the week."

PhillyUnion,2z6hqo,Cherrubim,2,Mon Mar 16 01:29:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the youth program is smart. That money we will get from selling HGP's will go towards buying better players, stadium expansion, paving the parking lots, etc. The main issue is that we are still a few years away from seeing the fruits of our labor. As of now, we have some fantastic talent in our academy, especially strikers."
PhillyUnion,2z6hqo,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"I love building through youth, but I'm not as hopeful as you. Do you think we could make more than we invested by the sale of Pfeffer? He's, without argument, our most promising prospect and I don't think anyone would come in looking to splash out for him. The problem is that so many other affluent teams across the world could produce a player of that same level themselves without having to pay us."
PhillyUnion,2z6hqo,Mike81890,2,Mon Mar 16 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though: American players are marketable as all hell. Buying someone like a Yedlin will guarantee foreign support and jersey sales that make up for the transfer fees.  We seem to have more promising prospects in our academy than Pfeffer, especially considering we have fucked up a good part of his development. Yedlin is the model we want to strive for. If one of our young players like Elney, Wilson, or Taylor-Parkes lives up to their potential, takes the league by storm like a Zardes, and then earns a transfer to Europe, then the system does pay for itself.  Further, the more effort we put into developing young players and acclimating them to the team, the more young talent we keep. If we start to prove that youngsters can come into this team and develop before going to Europe, we likely wouldn't lose out to someone like a Pulisic, Barbir, or Steffen, and they would stay here to develop."

PhillyUnion,2z6hqo,SirMothy,-2,Fri Mar 20 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"Philadelphia is going through a serious drought right now. I see your point more than you know. I've lived in NYC for 14 years transfering up here from Philly. It's been a very strange existence(9/11, plane crash in Queens, blackouts,  small plan flying into a building a block away from my office, Hurricanes, NY fans). The only fun I've had as a Philly native was the World Series Win. Then of course the next year we lose to the Wankees. I have one thing I can say about a lot of NY fans.. a very large contingent of the them are front running 2 faced hypocrites. Walking around wearing Mets hats when it's convenient but switching to the Wankees when it smells like a championship. Know this, every championship won by NY teams is the result of buying those championships. However when they lose all the money in the world can't buy the beauty of the viciousness of the media up here. I live and die with our teams too, unlike NY we don't need 2-3 teams per sport to feel relevant.  While I would never want our teams to be compromised like NY and LA teams, I do feel the Union must be more financially competitive because of the size of the Philly market. I've spoken to some MLS execs here in NYC at fund raisers and the Philly market is vital to MLS. Philly is the 2nd largest sports and media market on the US east coast and 4th nationally. Business smarts say the Union have to compete, They can not be run like a 2nd rate outpost. Either Sugarman and Sakiewicz make it happen or the Union will flaunder. However from an MLS perspective a team would be brought in almost immediately with the financial wherewithal deserving of this market to replace them. Sugarman and crew are playing moneyball with the Union which will fail the way MLS is trending. Every new franchise who didn't already have a team ready to graduate to MLS has come in with strong financial backing next is Atlanta, LAFC, Minnesota, then most likely Sacremento and/or Miami with deep pockets. MLS wants this Philadelphia franchise to thrive. It has a fan base and a top supporters group that is a force to be reckoned with. MLS is a world wide brand and Skysports will be yet another media monster showing the games. The Union need to compete. Personally I hope Comcast winds up taking over the Union. While the investment in the academy is great the on field product needs to be there, no other option is acceptable."

PhillyUnion,2z387j,spqr-king,7,Tue Mar 17 00:01:11 2015 UTC,I seriously love how even RSL fans were agreeing with us at how bad of a foul that was.
PhillyUnion,2z387j,spqr-king,2,Sun Mar 15 04:10:59 2015 UTC,Exactly. They need some kind of replay official or something because these goals are going to cost us the season. Hopefully it motivates our boys to kick some ass the rest of the season and not give them the chance to steal anymore.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,drewuke,12,Sun Mar 15 03:33:56 2015 UTC,As much as I wanted three points there having one from an away match against RSL is fine by me

PhillyUnion,2z38d7,rabidfrodo,12,Sun Mar 15 04:28:06 2015 UTC,"Who needs a rivalry with New York when you have MLS refs?  Thoughts:   Chaco was my clear man of the match. He made the whole team run. He should not have been taken off.  Fantastic game from Nando. That's what we all were expecting.  Williams is terrible. He is lazy as hell, and he lost his man on the set piece goal. Jimmy needs to be smarter with his subs. He needs to give his subs a chance to make an actual impact. Plus, Chaco should not have come off. No one else can keep the attack going for long enough to give the defense a break. Le Toux just looks bad."
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,FlapjackJackson,6,Sun Mar 15 03:39:49 2015 UTC,Le Toux needs to really stop taking corners I'm getting REALLY frustrated
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,bterre108,6,Sun Mar 15 04:46:13 2015 UTC,I get the Chaco sub when you're up away from home and he had a fitness issue. He isn't the most defensive player on the squad. We do need to sub earlier though.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,rabidfrodo,3,Sun Mar 15 04:17:39 2015 UTC,My issue with it is that it leaves us to bunker. You need someone that can keep a cohesive attack going to ensure that we aren't under constant pressure for the last 15 minutes. That's when defensive mistakes happen.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,FlapjackJackson,2,Sun Mar 15 04:27:56 2015 UTC,I get that I think his plan then is to use Pfeffer and Nogs to combine a bit more to create that. If Chacho isn't fit then he might be a liability going forward if he can't maintain possession or track back.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,rabidfrodo,2,Sun Mar 15 04:34:37 2015 UTC,We need Jimmy Mac on that bench

PhillyUnion,2z38d7,Incara1010,5,Sun Mar 15 03:37:05 2015 UTC,The officiating was awful. Can't stand it when the ref waits a second or two to blow the whistle. Calls have to be more instinctual. He handed out some really awful yellows on both sides. ...and I'm sure somebody will have less than positive things to say about the PK call.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,mtommyboy,9,Sun Mar 15 03:43:27 2015 UTC,Le Toux has been awful these first two games. As much as I love him he HAS to pick it up to stay in the 11.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,keystonemike,2,Sun Mar 15 04:27:17 2015 UTC,Killed a lot of offensive movement with bad touches. Totally agree.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,spqr-king,5,Sun Mar 15 13:06:31 2015 UTC,This one hurts considering its 2 for 2 on refs screwing us out of a win... Someone needs to complain and this guy needs a suspension as well considering this is the 7th GK he has given in 7 games. Good news for Curtain though management has to see we are improving and getting screwed over rather then just failing at life.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,jd158ug,5,Sun Mar 15 03:39:06 2015 UTC,We should focus on the things we can control. There will always be BS calls from refs. Now what about that set piece defending? It was shocking.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,xxtoejamfootballxx,2,Sun Mar 15 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"I don't get how the only consistent thing we've done as a franchise since day 1 is SUCK at defending set pieces.  It's ridiculous, especially when we've had so many solid CBs and goalies.  I'm blaming it on lack of consistent defensive lineups."
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,mthslhrookiecard,2,Sun Mar 15 04:07:32 2015 UTC,That's our biggest consistency from year to year
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sun Mar 15 04:11:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I was really hoping having a big guy like Vitoria back there we would look better on set pieces.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,EdBacon,3,Sun Mar 15 03:40:19 2015 UTC,It was more about marking. On that second goal the ball was played in pretty low but three RSL players were allowed to run onto the back post. It's got to be about organization and picking up runs.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,keystonemike,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:45:16 2015 UTC,Our defensive shape was bad all game.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,Invas10n,1 point,Sun Mar 15 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, there were 3 unmarked RSL guys in there that could have put that ball away."
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,in_the_against,5,Sun Mar 15 15:20:21 2015 UTC,Why sub off Maidana when Le Toux is clearly the weak link on the team. Chaco played part in all three goals... He is our offense.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,LocksTheFox,3,Sun Mar 15 03:47:16 2015 UTC,"Fitness? idk. (Plus, based on the personnel we had on the bench, easier to sub off Chaco than Le Toux)"
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,thelostdolphin,8,Sun Mar 15 03:49:17 2015 UTC,Fitness for sure. Same reason he didn't start last week. Curtin said it in his weekly press conference (albeit more tactfully).
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,dragonjock27,4,Sun Mar 15 03:50:55 2015 UTC,Le Toux is more helpful defensively late in the game as well.
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,B4kstabr,3,Sun Mar 15 04:02:00 2015 UTC,We've got a talented squad. Sucks that the refs have screwed us out of 4 points this year

PhillyUnion,2z38d7,WildGooseCarolinian,3,Sun Mar 15 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"I honestly felt that given the flow of play, a draw is probably a fair scoreline. The PK was weak, yeah, but I'm not too disappointed. Winning would have been an absolute gift considering the bizarre mistakes RSL's backline made tonight. I'm more satisfied that we could take advantage of those opportunities.   My main concern has really been M'Bolhi's command of the box. He doesn't seem confident off his line or in the air. That, and cleaner tackling on the backline. A lot of dangerous set pieces were given up off clumsy challenges."
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,jpoRS,4,Sun Mar 15 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"Dude made some big saves, but he was also way out of position on a couple of free kicks, and kept punching the ball right back into the middle and zone 14.  He's fine, but he's not playing like a DP getting DP money.  That absolutely has to get better."
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,LocksTheFox,3,Sun Mar 15 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"M'Bolhi is not a DP, only reason he counted as one last year was because of his transfer fee. Our three DPs this year are Chaco, Edu, and Fernando.  Not that that changes your fundamental point, but I thought you should know anyway."
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,jpoRS,3,Sun Mar 15 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"According to Tannenwald about a week ago, Chaco's no longer a DP"
PhillyUnion,2z38d7,WildGooseCarolinian,2,Sun Mar 15 04:06:47 2015 UTC,According to wiki he is ... I'd give the slight edge to The Goalkeeper on that one though.  So what unfounded rumor should we start about who are new third DP will be?

PhillyUnion,2z38d7,WildGooseCarolinian,2,Sun Mar 15 03:53:31 2015 UTC,We're two games in and that number is already 4. Still 32 games left. I'd say 13.5 is low.

I think it's time to try somebody new in place of Le Toux.  He simply loses the ball and his positioning far too often.  I'm still not entirely sure how this formation is supposed to work, and I'm not entirely sure the players are either.  There's room for improvement.  I'll take the 1 point here.

We were lucky but you make your own luck more often than not.   Biggest worry is to many games like this hurt a teams morale.

PhillyUnion,2z38d7,Krefted,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:08:52 2015 UTC,"The Union could barely string together 3 passes in the 2nd half. Most of the first half and the entire second half was completely one sided, with RSL controlling the game.   We were lucky on the 3rd goal, and did a good job to take advantage of a horrible mistake on the 2nd goal. The first goal took a lucky deflection, but Aristeguieta did a great job of following Maidana's shot.  Aristeguieta and Maidana were the only bright spots for me last night, but we just looked like we had no creativity with the ball at all. Everything was over the top or out wide (usually overhit). Although the penalty call was pathetic, I feel lucky that we even drew that game. It's only the 2nd game though, so I'm not too worried. I think we're going to get much better as the year goes on. I'd really like to see Wenger get involved more too."

Basically the team has been around for 6 years. Went to the final of the US Open cup last year (our version of England's FA cup). We don't play a single table because we have play offs an all teams are technical owned by the league. We have been, so far, about midtable in terms of average performance as far as I can tell bit with the forced Parity of MLS all teams have a legit chance of winning the league. There's one main supporters group the Sons if Ben that existed before the team and are the reason the team was created. We try to play a possession based game and usually dominate in that category but have had a time time scoring goals. For some reason a few people in Sherwsbury, England follow the team (something about the colors they say). Rene Muelesteen (sp?) is currently in a temporary contract as something of a technical director advisor dealy. At one point out shirt sponsors paid us more than almost everyone else on the world per season (if the media can be believed). Players to love: Le Toux (or Le Three as those of us who were at the first ever home game call him), Fernando (on loan DP from Nantes in France), Pffefer (homegrown kid we signed in High School and then loaned to Hoffenhein and is now in the cusp on breaking into the First Team).  He Who Shall Not Be Named- tried to destroy this team, never talk about him. Carlos Valdes- used to love him an now we hate him because he gave up on this team."

PhillyUnion,2z2c9x,lyrae,3,Sat Mar 14 22:58:35 2015 UTC,The Union has a lot to live up to.

Now the real question is if you can listen to the game in English instead on Spanish.  And the answer to that is... maybe. You might be able to turn on the SAP but not everyone can.  http://www.mlssoccer.com/sap-local   English audio is not available in all markets (see below).

I believe ESPN and Fox Sports both paid to have at least one game every Sunday night too.  So yeah it might be a bit unfortunate that that some people might not be able to listen to Unimas in English.

PhillyUnion,2yx3q5,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"I got it to work for Comcast, but it's very strange... So there are 4 or 5 different identical Unimas channels scattered between 0-2000 in your channel guide. Only one of these is HD and that one didn't include English in SAP. Out of the remaining SD channels, one had English available. I think it was the 3rd highest, numerically.   Hopefully the HD one has English tonight. If not, I'll be getting some more refreshers on my Spanish comprehension."
PhillyUnion,2yx3q5,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Mar 13 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"I think this was my problem.  I have a basic cable package and while I could find ~5 different unimas/univision channels ""on the dial"", I only had access to two of them.   So I could watch the game in Spanish, and normally I would have been totally fine with that if it weren't for everyone telling me to just use the SAP and this overly sarcastic FAQ and the corresponding thread that went with it which basically implied you are a xenophobe/racist if you dare complain about Unimas."
PhillyUnion,2yx3q5,truckloadof4skin,2,Fri Mar 13 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I love that a perk of my extra special cable package is the privilege of watching the same SD channel feed on 4 different channels. I truly am the 1%. /s  And wow, that certainly is a snarky FAQ. It sounds like the snark is directed at people who are streaming for free and complaining about the language issue, but it obviously disregards all the paying customers who just want to use the feature that was advertised. If MLS and Unimas didn't promote the English language option, I would have just watched in Spanish and not said a word, but when you make it a selling point to draw in more viewers and then fail to deliver consistently for all cable customers, I think it's a reasonable thing to want improved."

From there AO then sends out an email to all members or news letter subscribers telling them when they go on sale.

PhillyUnion,2ysted,rabidfrodo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:56:43 2015 UTC,This is great and all but if the USA doesn't make the finals then we're stuck with tickets to a Costa Rica vs Mexico match at 7:30 on a Sunday night. Kinda stupid time for the game I think. If it was earlier in the day I think they'd get a better crowd.   Or they should of combined the 3rd place games and finals with one ticket and held them on the same day. Like they do with the quarterfinals and semifinals. That way you're more likely to see the yanks play at some point during the day.

PhillyUnion,2yq27v,rabidfrodo,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:07:11 2015 UTC,"MLS has control, just maybe not on paper.  Refs don't run the league."
PhillyUnion,2yq27v,dooper2010,3,Thu Mar 12 00:34:44 2015 UTC,Refs aren't running the league but at that level of the sport each game is analyzed and graded live by a certified evaluator. This is how assignments are determined. If a ref is getting sub par grades then they are not assigned bigger games. Yes the league might have a say in this but the USSF and PRO handle most things with referees.
PhillyUnion,2yq27v,rabidfrodo,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"MLS has no control over the referee assignments.  I believe they do have the ability to request that a ref not be assigned to their games anymore, but I'm not sure PRO has to honor that."

PhillyUnion,2ym807,TriflingHotDogVendor,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:33:00 2015 UTC,Was this the plan from the beginning?
PhillyUnion,2ym807,EdBacon,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:59:06 2015 UTC,Yes. When a transfer fee factors into a transfer MLS allows the fee to be factored into the cap hit of the player's salary. I'm not sure if it's negotiable or how the fee is distributed though
PhillyUnion,2yk8gg,dstaxonstax,5,Tue Mar 10 14:43:04 2015 UTC,"If you are wondering for fantasy purposes we have a Fantasy Talk Tuesday thread if you have other Union fantasy questions.  But to answer your question. I can't imagine Le Toux giving up PKs.  He's been the primary Union penalty taker since 2010 and hasn't missed once.    As far as free kicks.  The best I can tell from watching preseason and the opener, Vitoria will not be taking long free kicks where you would be crossing the ball into the box.   If the free kick is within striking distance of goal it looks like he could be the second choice to take them behind Maidana."
PhillyUnion,2yk8gg,Dean_Moriarty,4,Tue Mar 10 14:57:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's pretty hard to ask the face of the franchise to give up PKs if they've literally never missed."
PhillyUnion,2yk8gg,keystonemike,3,Tue Mar 10 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"Yea I would have his 6'5"" in the box with Maidana or Nogueria over the ball"
PhillyUnion,2yk8gg,in_the_against,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's my thinking too. And Sapong if he's on the field. Significantly more height than last year."
PhillyUnion,2yk8gg,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:05:05 2015 UTC,I am OK with Sapong being on the field. We will never know if he can return to his previous form if we don't test him out.
PhillyUnion,2yk8gg,ignoramis,2,Wed Mar 11 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"I definitely want to see Sapong on the field. The issue is the formation that is the result of him being in the starting XI. Ideally, I'd like to see him and Casey come on at the 70 min or so if we aren't producing and changing it up then but having Fernando up to start things off and most importantly, Maidana on the field."
PhillyUnion,2yk8gg,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"...I'm so sad now. I was really hoping to find a center back that took PKs. Well thanks people. I'm still excited for the union, your forward group is nice. I've always liked Casey."

PhillyUnion,2yjy43,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue Mar 10 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"Dang! One spot out of the top 10.  I've only made one transfer so far, Ousted for Deric to help save some money.  Besides that I'm going to wait another week to make more transfers I think."
PhillyUnion,2yjy43,thelostdolphin,2,Tue Mar 10 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"First year playing, but felt pretty good about my squad, all in all, going into the first round. Back line and gk gave me 25 pts, which I did not expect. Midfielders were okay with 23, but my forwards killed me. Fernando and Zardes combined for only 4 pts. That was the difference between a pretty solid first week and just a little above average.   With that said, I don't think I'm going to change things up that much, but as much as it pains me, Fernando may have to sit a few out until the offense really jells properly. I think I'll hang on to Zardes for another week at least and see what happens.   Hmmm. Probably should have gone with some of the more obvious choices instead of trying to be cute going with dark horses."
PhillyUnion,2yjy43,funkyquasar,2,Tue Mar 10 16:00:31 2015 UTC,"Only wound up with 48, but I'm going to stick with most of my guys for now. Villa being awarded with an assist would have been nice though."

PhillyUnion,2yjy43,9guy,2,Tue Mar 10 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"I did ok with 68 this round, but I already screwed myself for the next round. I got overzealous with my transfers and ended up with two guys in my starting lineup that don't have a round 2 game. Without any viable subs, I then made two extra transfers to try and salvage something. So, I'm starting the next round at -8 and I'm really regretting everything I've done since round 1 ended haha."

PhillyUnion,2yhjmo,thanksbastards,2,Tue Mar 10 01:02:10 2015 UTC,"While the defense was encouraging, we had like 3 decent chances all game.  We still can't break down teams who bunker in the box, and that has been an issue for a couple years now."
PhillyUnion,2yhjmo,TaeKurmulti,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"I realize my comment may have been overly cynical but yes, I consider simply drawing against the worst team in the MLS, while they had multiple holes in their starting lineup due to injury, while being one man up for fifteen or so minutes (maybe more, honestly I don't remember what minute the injury happened in) a massive failure. That being said I completely agree with spqr-king, its only one game. I believe in this team and I really think we will be able to put in some really good performances going forward. Hopefully everyone watching from home sees that as well..."
PhillyUnion,2yhjmo,notnewton1,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:57:30 2015 UTC,"Losing would have been a massive failure. It's the first match of the season, chemistry still needs to develop up top with Fernando in the mix. I think we saw enough good stuff to expect better to come. Your comment was Chicken Little crying about the sky falling while still in the egg."
PhillyUnion,2yi5kj,rabidfrodo,9,Tue Mar 10 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"Just finished the first half. The team looked okay. I can see what Curtin wanted to do, but the team clearly hadn't played the formation enough to be comfortable in it. They had what I'd call two clear chances, Wenger 21 and Le Toux 44 min. Overall the forwards looked isolated with neither Le Toux or Wenger cutting in enough and Nogs and Edu sitting deep. This left a lot of the long balls to be easy turnovers as Colorado's deep midfielders had no pressure.  Also Union deserved a penalty in the 48th minute off a Wenger cross. Serne handles the ball in the box prior to clearing it. Totally missed this during the game."
PhillyUnion,2yi5kj,keystonemike,8,Tue Mar 10 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"Finished the 2nd half now. Union looked better, but saw same issues we had last year with breaking down a team that was sitting deep. Petrescu lost the match around the 80th min. Letting Wenger get a kick to the back without at least a yellow let Colorado foul their way the rest of the game.   The Union to often tried crosses that weren't landing. Le Toux and Wenger were never great in the air and Fernando was getting beat due to a size difference. The team held possession they needed to spread the Rapids out and let the midfield three and wingers pass the ball until they pulled someone out of position. The Rapids played well sitting deep and narrow giving Philly the wide areas which they didn't take advantage of by putting their three attackers in the box almost immediately once they had possession.   The chances created were from a midfield run or pulling Colorado out of position by forcing them to defend the wide areas. The subs needed to be brought on earlier. Casey's first touch was easily one of the best chances and was from his movement and ability to get on a cross. Overall not a bad game something to build from, but not the best."
PhillyUnion,2yi5kj,keystonemike,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"I think when they play 4-4-2 that one of Le Toux, Wenger, or Sapong needs to be dropped. You need at least one of your wide midfielders to be able to pass the ball. I think that's probably Le Toux at this point. Maybe Pfeffer, but ideally McLaughlin will progress enough to fill in there."
PhillyUnion,2yi5kj,estebandelasexface12,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:10:18 2015 UTC,I wouldn't drop Sapong as he is playing centrally and is willing to make runs and can win balls in the box. I would drop Wenger just because I think his decision making can be a bit slow or lacking sometimes. I think Le Toux has legs to make runs off of a long ball the Wenger doesn't. Though be dropping Le Toux you could almost switch to a 4-3-3 when attacking and 4-4-2 when defending. I'd say Pfeffer or Maidana would come in for Le Toux as they can both play centrally. Jimmy would come in for Wenger as he naturally plays wide.

Dillon Powers doesn't even come close to trying to play or shield the ball. He just straight runs Nogs over without even looking in the ball's direction. It doesn't look like a dive either. Nogs doesn't just fall down, you can see the impact as the players collide.   Damnit, I need to stop watching this it's just preventing me from moving on..."
PhillyUnion,2yeuv2,DrewGo,4,Mon Mar 9 21:10:17 2015 UTC,dunno how that hand ball wasn't called. the dude literally moved his entire arm into the ball like twice...ref completely watched the entire thing. that ref was so awful lol
PhillyUnion,2yeuv2,hoax021,3,Mon Mar 9 16:38:39 2015 UTC,I was in section 117. Everyone was freaking out about the no-call. Everyone around me had the same look of utter bewilderment as to how the ref could have missed it.
PhillyUnion,2yeuv2,DrewGo,3,Mon Mar 9 17:25:03 2015 UTC,The worst part is you could see some of the Colorado players even react to it. Literally everyone around the ref saw it. He was either completely out there or deliberately decided to not call it. I really don't understand.
PhillyUnion,2yeuv2,EdBacon,2,Mon Mar 9 18:30:57 2015 UTC,Gutless refereeing. That needs to improve. Wish every game was reffed the way Orl-NYC was.
PhillyUnion,2yeuv2,thelostdolphin,3,Mon Mar 9 23:06:56 2015 UTC,That Casey header at 86' was a great header.  Hard to direct it on goal from such a short free kick.
PhillyUnion,2yeuv2,sgrtpepper,2,Tue Mar 10 18:57:04 2015 UTC,First half Le Tour tried the back heel instead of shooting at what seemed to be an open goal. Can you pull that?

PhillyUnion,2yeuv2,keystonemike,2,Mon Mar 9 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"Man, at least this team shoots the damn ball now. Remember when we would just rinky dink in a semicircle around the box?  Maybe our finishing was off, but there was a LOT good happening for us."
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,Timothy-H,6,Mon Mar 9 01:27:18 2015 UTC,His complete lack of a left foot is why this team has an offensive black hole at LB.
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,Dahorah,1 point,Mon Mar 9 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"This has crippled us for four years now.  Agree with the sentiments about trading Williams and moving Gaddis over.  All credit to Ray.  He has vastly improved and I liked him better last year at RB than Williams.  He's just not a LB.  And although it is hard to get a good LB in this league, we seem to have the biggest problem in the league with it.  We are constantly covering for the LB spot, which causes 2nd-order problems.  And isn't this the whole point of a team-based youth system?  Telling parents ""we know your kid is a hot shot striker in 8th grade, but we project him as a LB and we need that position.""   (yes - I understand the Union youth system is in its early days)."
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,thewizardofosmium,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:42:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the time to do that was right after Williams' nice season. They waited a year too long to get value back for Williams."
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,keystonemike,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've been saying this for a while.  He just has no left foot whatsoever, I feel like they should flip flop him and williams."
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,TaeKurmulti,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:40:50 2015 UTC,As far as I can tell switching the two of them wouldn't do all that much. Williams also prefers his right foot. I think trading williams for a natural left back wouldn't be a terrible idea though. Then we could shift Gaddis over to the right and have an actualy LB play LB.
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,notnewton1,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"I know Williams is also stronger with his right foot, but Ray is basically allergic to even using his left foot.  At least Williams I feel like could swing a cross in with his left foot.  Although who knows maybe he can't since they've never tried him there.  I agree though about trading for a LB, but honestly I can't even name a LB who may be available in the MLS.  The fact that the Union protected Fabinho basically tells us all we need to know about the quality of LB's in the league.  It's kind of amazing that a professional player can't use his left foot, I play basically beer league soccer and can whip the ball in with either foot."
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,TaeKurmulti,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:46:59 2015 UTC,"I think Gaddis playing more advanced was a result of Colorado sitting so deep all game. When the other team is basically planting all 10 field players behind the ball it gives your fullbacks plenty of space to get forward. It's not really a result of the formation or tactics, though I do believe that we're going to see Gaddis try to make more of an offensive impact from the left this season."
PhillyUnion,2ye8r6,DrewGo,-4,Mon Mar 9 13:07:21 2015 UTC,servers pretty much no purpose going forward. we need a true left back.
PhillyUnion,2yeg0c,nojose5,4,Mon Mar 9 02:31:40 2015 UTC,I think Orlando looked great they know how to win and should do well but NYCFC looked like they took time to get in the swing of things which is normal. I honestly think Orlando will be one of the better teams in the east especially after watching NE collapse tonight against the Sounders.
PhillyUnion,2yeg0c,spqr-king,2,Mon Mar 9 03:49:30 2015 UTC,Orlando looked very susceptible on the counter. I'm not convinced they will be able to play defense well enough to win in MLS.
PhillyUnion,2yeg0c,arkr,3,Mon Mar 9 04:03:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's too early to judge any of the Eastern teams. New England got battered but they're much better than what they showed. I think overall there are so many changes in the division with new coaches, new teams, new systems being set up, that we won't see the playoff picture for another 2-3 months at least.  What's disappointing is that the Union retained most of their core but because of the chopping and changing we haven't had any coaching consistency. We should be taking advantage of all this commotion but instead we're working on getting our offense flowing.  I think the Union is somewhere around the 5th or 6th best team in the division. I hope we can just keep grinding points away for the whole season and try and snag a playoff spot."
PhillyUnion,2yeg0c,Guidosama,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:15:19 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I'm new on here so I'm trying to figure this all out. But anyways, I watched the game from the River End Saturday and admit I was frustrated at times. I recorded the game at home and re-watched it Sunday when I wasn't inebriated. I wasn't frustrated necessarily at our play, but the ball just didn't want to go in. After watching on TV I must say we looked a lot better than we did in person. We dominated every statistical category and we were in command all game. I watched the Sunday night games and DVR'd them as well just so I could go back and do some analysis. (I played American Football all the way up into college, so watching ""film"" has become sort of a guilty pleasure.) I watched the games the first time through Sunday, and after getting past all the fanfare and the atmospheres, I paid more attention to detail Monday night.   What I will say is this, I felt that the Union overall played a lot better than both NYCFC and Orlando. Now, I don't know if it will remain that way as the season progresses and teams find their form. But, you could tell NYC and Orlando were both expansion teams playing their first real game together with their respective units.   I read a lot of the comments on Philly Soccer Page, and while I don't disagree with what a lot of people have to say, it is a little early to be jumping ship and screaming for heads. We need a little continuity in this team, something we have lacked in our short existence. Is Curtin the best manager? No, but I don't think he's too bad and I really am not going to get on his case this season if we suffer some ups and downs. I think everyone howling at his mistakes in this first match are going a little overboard. We just got back from Florida, we've only had a few weeks to really get things organized. We had some heavy legs out there towards the end of the game, the weather was frigid, and the pitch was concrete. Fernando was in Venezuela all week working out his Visa, so he wasn't really around. Curtin was saying not everyone's 100% and I will give him that benefit of the doubt. Our defense looks fairly solid as Colorado only managed 2 shots, and none on goal. We'll get there. This team is still gelling and haven't quite hit their stride.   I did some statistical analysis from the past 5 years to see where we should hope to end up. Also, I looked at last years 6th place finish (which would be good enough to get us into the post season this year). We were 10W-12L-12D last season. Now if you think about it, we had a few matches where we either lost late, or blew a lead and settled for Draws. I think those leaks will be repaired this year on defense, and I think we have a few more options offensively that will definitely create more opportunities for us this season unlike last year. That in itself might be enough to swing us a couple games and a few points that will put us in good standing. We should expect nothing less than 13 or 14 wins, and if we can keep the losses around the 8-9 mark, we should be in good shape. I'll take 13 Draws if we can match that in wins. We just have to average about 1 loss a month over the course of the season (season being 8.5 months or so), while maintaining around 5-7 points a month. 2 wins a draw and a loss (not necessarily in that order, and I understand it won't be like that). I know we will go on a streak of 4-5 straight with some draws thrown in and go on a run where we don't accumulate any losses. Then go through stretches where we encounter the opposite. But we must not have a stretch of 9 winless games or whatever it was last year, and I don't think things will get that bad this year. I also noticed that the league's parity is decreasing as well year to year, so our 42 points for 6th, might not cut it this year especially with some of the new DP's in the league. We are going to have to get as close or above that 50 point threshold to secure a playoff spot.   Alright, I will stop boring ya'll now. Feel free to correct me on anything I won't take any offense, I'm just talking off the top of my head and a lot of my own opinion."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,runlevel06,6,Mon Mar 9 00:10:53 2015 UTC,"I think Curtin wanted to be more aggressive at home on opening day by going with two strikers.  Unfortunately we weren't very aggressive or successful with two strikers, and he picked playing Le Toux over Maidana because Wenger has been good down the left side.  I hope he realizes Maidana should be in our starting XI from now on."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,in_the_against,2,Mon Mar 9 00:46:57 2015 UTC,The team lacks creativity in the middle without Maidana. It was really evident last year when he was injured.
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,in_the_against,7,Mon Mar 9 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, along with Nogs, Maidana is our most skilled player."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,keystonemike,1 point,Mon Mar 9 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"I agree to some extent. However, I actually like that Curtin was trying to tailor the 11 to the opposing team. Part of the reason that Colorado started fouling so much is that they weren't prepared to defend our formation. If we had buried a few of those legitimate chances (Le Toux chip instead of pass to keeper, Le Toux wide open header, a few close shots, crossbar, Casey thumping header) then Curtin looks like a genius. We fall back into the 4-5-1, get a bit more possession and hold a 2-0 lead. I think that the idea was sound. It didn't necessarily come off well, but it says a lot about the coaching."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,xenoletum,0,Tue Mar 10 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"We were extremely aggressive in the first half with two strikers, or are you just completely forgetting the majority of our first half shots on goal?"
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,in_the_against,5,Mon Mar 9 11:25:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, in my opinion we did not gain enough with two strikers to keep Maidana on the bench"
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,thelostdolphin,6,Mon Mar 9 12:29:36 2015 UTC,He wanted Sapong in the starting XI to match the physicality of Colorado but I don't like that the move came at the expense of Chaco
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,EdBacon,3,Mon Mar 9 12:11:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think matching physicality with the same is the good way to counter a team like Colorado. Play around them with skill instead of butting heads. They wanted a slow, chippy game, and we gave it to them."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:05:23 2015 UTC,I agree. I think Curtin is just so happy he's got these really tall guys finally and wants to use them.
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,keystonemike,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I think that Colorado is physical but not particularly athletic. We got a red card. Had we finished, Curtin looks like a smart tactician."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,hoax021,4,Tue Mar 10 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"what annoys me is how bad this 4-2-4 formation looked vs RBNY in preseason yet he still uses it on opening day. There's just something missing in the midfield (chaco's creativeness) and it just makes us sloppy and not do much going forward. 2nd half was better but with the Colorado divers, fake injuries, and muggers we couldn't get much flow to the game and our chances we're as high or well taken as they should have been. I'm not worried at all if we go back to the 4-2-3-1 but if we don't i will really start to doubt curtin."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,CouldBeBetterForever,2,Mon Mar 9 01:29:05 2015 UTC,"I really, really don't like how they look in the 4-2-4. Curtin better not use it next game."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,keystonemike,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:18:11 2015 UTC,"I've said elsewhere. If we go 4-4-2 (which I argue is appropriate in certain games), one of the wide midfielders needs to be a true mid, not a converted forward. We need another player who can make a pass/cross. Could be Maidana wide left, or Pfeffer/McLauglin wide right."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,spqr-king,3,Tue Mar 10 20:21:13 2015 UTC,Just trying new things its understandable but I agree we need some more opportunities created and the ball needs to hit the back of the net every match.
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,Dpw22393,2,Mon Mar 9 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure, didn't make sense to me either. I guess they really wanted to try out playing with two strikers and he was the odd man out."
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:45:44 2015 UTC,I think Sapong and Fernando could be a good combo but not at the expense of not starting Chaco.  Edu and Nog need to play deep in midfield as neither has the attacking vision and creativity to be anything close to the 10 role that Maidana can play.  you can't leave out Wenger or Le Toux so unfortunately for Sapong I think we need to play with one striker.
PhillyUnion,2ye01t,rabidfrodo,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"I think Curtin wanted a more attacking lineup with what amounts to 4 forwards, because Colorado isn't a good team and had a brand new back four. I can only assume he felt that our midfield and defense was strong enough to let the 4 forwards range and attack as they please. As we could tell this resulted in a lack of possession and patience in the final third. Sapong and Fernando weren't able to control the long balls sent in and often lost possession with the long balls. Le Toux and Wenger both want to attack the net or cross it which is ok when you have a forward who is getting on the end of the balls. This also means the first chance we get is the one they take without moving it back and trying to move Colorado out of position. They also struggled from being on the same page as each other."
PhillyUnion,2yefu6,Taeshan,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:30:12 2015 UTC,"I won't be at this match, but I got the Irish shirt last year. The following game I went to they were selling them in the store at the stadium. If you can't find anyone to get you one, they may be at the shop the next game you make it out to."
PhillyUnion,2ycrmx,shelf13,7,Sun Mar 8 17:56:16 2015 UTC,Its been one match everyone calm the hell down... I know Colorado is supposed to be weak but they also fouled players the entire match and had no shots on goal in the second half. The goals will come with the team meshing.
PhillyUnion,2ycrmx,spqr-king,2,Sun Mar 8 21:09:06 2015 UTC,I just hope Curtin doesn't keep trying the 4-2-4. It doesn't look good.
PhillyUnion,2ycrmx,CouldBeBetterForever,2,Mon Mar 9 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Nearly every team in MLS had the same result or similar to the Union and showed the same rust or is getting used to new players and systems. As someone who will jump all over them if they don't live up to potential, I don't see this as a time to panic."
PhillyUnion,2ycrmx,LCBline,4,Mon Mar 9 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"After yesterday, they better be."
PhillyUnion,2ycrmx,funkyquasar,4,Sun Mar 8 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"I don't get why Curtin wants to do the 4-1-3-2 thing. We have great personnel for a regular old 4-2-3-1: a big forward who can do the hold-up bit but is also mobile enough to do everything else by himself; we have a talented dribbling and passing #10; we have speedy wingers who can play high and help the forward if need be but will also play wide and put in some crosses (if not we have overlapping full-backs); and we have a pair of high quality center-midfielders--one who is more of a ball-winner, and one who is more of a get-on-the-ball passing type. That seems like the common sense move to me."

PhillyUnion,2ya9id,drewuke,20,Sat Mar 7 23:07:27 2015 UTC,Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,LocksTheFox,8,Sat Mar 7 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"Just got home, I have three main points I want to make.  1.) Honestly, why the hell is Le Toux allowed to take any free kicks anymore.  Nogueira, Maidana, Vitoria, whoever should be above the free kick list before Le Toux.  2.)  Nogueira had an awful game for his standards.  He had way too many poor touches, miss timed passes, and misplaced balls.   We are relying on him to be the same how Bradley is to the national team.  If you don't have any options, give it to Nogs.  This obviously places a lot of pressure on him and gives him a ton of touches.  I don't expect him to be some crazy play making CAM, but he is our general and he needs to be cleaner with his balls.  However, it wasn't entirely his fault, which leads me to...  3.)  I hate our ""4-4-2"".  It has been beaten to death even before the first game but it plays too much like a 4-2-4. We have no midfield presence.  Edu and Nogueira are left completely stranded.   Part of the reason Nogs had a poor game is because he had so few options to pass to.  Either boot it long to one of our four forwards, or drop it back to the defense.  It got better once Maidana came in, but once we were up a man Le Toux pushed up to a pure striker and he and Nando either kept on making the same runs or kept on not making the same runs.  Either way, I thought we were obviously the better team, but unfortunately couldn't find the goal. We are going to be a team that tries to win 1-0, sometimes we will sometimes we won't."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,Dean_Moriarty,15,Sun Mar 8 03:52:24 2015 UTC,"Not using as an excuse but the ref (especially in the closing minutes) lost control of match and more then the Rapids did his best to interpret any rhythm that the union had. It's hard to enjoy a match with something like 35 fouls in it. Even before the red card and man advantage, the Rapids came out with the intent to trench themselves in and play fucking dirty. We need to be more clinical in the final third then we were today. The league needs to take some retrospective action against this Rapids team as a whole. You don't play soccer like that. Theres a line between hard tacking soccer and just plain dirty!"
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,nojose5,7,Sat Mar 7 23:16:46 2015 UTC,"Well, there were good things to be sure. The Union were absolutely the better team tonight. If their finishing gets better hopefully we'll see better results in the future."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,SnookiIsJazz,11,Sat Mar 7 23:11:08 2015 UTC,I'm terrified we'll see that all year.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,southerngangster,6,Sat Mar 7 23:11:05 2015 UTC,I noticed Wenger taking about 2-3 too many touches in the final third. If he had crossed earlier he could have set up several goals. When he has taken fewer touches he has been a definite playmaker for is.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,runlevel06,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:15:18 2015 UTC,I agree 100% He was trying to setup every shot for his right and every defender was waiting for him to go right. He needs a left footed shot.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,thelonelyswineherd,7,Mon Mar 9 00:07:05 2015 UTC,At least Curtin will realize Chaco needs to start... Right?
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,marble617,11,Sun Mar 8 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"The ref lost control of the game ever since he sent off Burling. Also, the game felt so much slower after we took Noguiera off.  On a positive note, I think Fernando and Sapong looked pretty good up top. They just need that final pass."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,georgepordge,13,Sat Mar 7 23:10:58 2015 UTC,Sapong and Nando played alright but there was no final ball today because there was no one to do so.  It's why I prefer Nando alone with Maidana behind him
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,ebradlee10,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:27:02 2015 UTC,I felt Sapong played poorly. But it's probably because the two forward system is a train wreck.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,FlapjackJackson,5,Sun Mar 8 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"I wish the players had gone on strike . . .  The ref missed two clear penalties, and the only thing Colorado was good at was mugging players."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,FlashKelly,4,Sat Mar 7 23:44:29 2015 UTC,Burling got sent off and we just lost all of our rhythm. There was no sense of urgency going forward and we started playing long ball after long ball. Disappointing result but I liked a lot of what I saw and thought we played pretty well overall.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,georgepordge,2,Sat Mar 7 23:12:46 2015 UTC,I don't think we got into a rhythm at all. Colorado did a good job of physically stopping the way we wanted to play.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,funkyquasar,4,Sat Mar 7 23:14:33 2015 UTC,It felt like most of our guys were playing in molasses.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,WildGooseCarolinian,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:17:51 2015 UTC,"Felt the same way for much of it. Some of that is probably that they're in early season form, part may be that the field was really, really slow today by the look of the ball. Seemed like it would just die on passes or loose balls. Looking forward to the condition improving with more sun & less ice."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,chrisronald67,5,Sun Mar 8 06:08:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with the ""meh"" consensus...but if Casey's header is a foot to the left this looks like a hard-fought win against a determined foe."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,BissAu,3,Sun Mar 8 00:31:54 2015 UTC,Refs sucked so bad..wow. So angry. Still had fun though. Need to sit in the river end next time. We were way too loud in our section lol
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,cjhanpatty,3,Sun Mar 8 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yea same moved to the standing section around 120 and got yelled at for being a bit too passionate, but worth it"

PhillyUnion,2ya9id,ChefJim27,5,Sun Mar 8 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"The referee decided not to call a penalty on 3 seperate occasions. Not only that, but today I learned you can kung fu an opponent in the back and not get a card. Bottom line, the Union played well enough to win, but didn't get the fortunate bounce they needed to get over the hump. Definitely two points dropped, but I'm not anywhere near declaring the sky to be falling.  Yet."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,cjd5286,5,Sun Mar 8 02:27:59 2015 UTC,The 4-2-4 made my eyes bleed.

PhillyUnion,2ya9id,eragon38,3,Sat Mar 7 23:10:04 2015 UTC,That was boring
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,georgepordge,3,Sat Mar 7 23:10:49 2015 UTC,"At least everyone looked decent, we just weren't good enough to grab the winner here.  Gaddis was probably the best performer for the Union and Ethan White, the worst."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,georgepordge,5,Sat Mar 7 23:12:58 2015 UTC,I didn't think White played poorly at all.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,FlapjackJackson,8,Sat Mar 7 23:14:46 2015 UTC,"He had some iffy moments, and others had to cover for him. He didn't have a bad game but put in the weakest performance of the team today."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,georgepordge,4,Sat Mar 7 23:24:29 2015 UTC,"Le Toux was far, far worse than Ethan, as was Sheanon."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:43:09 2015 UTC,"Seba didn't play well nor did he play awful. Sheanon too. Ethan as well, but he made mistakes you never ever want to see from your centerback"
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,Keepa1,4,Sat Mar 7 23:46:05 2015 UTC,"All of Seba's service was terrible, he drifted too centrally, and he was a step behind.  As for Sheanon, he was too lazy to sprint forward and provide width and too lazy to track back to defend. He was often too far up field and out of position which made Ethan look bad since he had to cover for Sheanon."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,CoffeeScentedUrine,3,Sun Mar 8 00:44:37 2015 UTC,i don't think colorado had a real shot on target the entire match.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,TaeKurmulti,3,Sat Mar 7 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like they need to work on their touch. During a pass, when they received it, it would bounce 20 feet away from them.   Also, their attack is like 70% complete. They need to work on the remaining 30%. Plenty of chances missed.   Overall, pretty boring game. I hope to see better."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,RJBuggy,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"First game, so I wouldn't worry so much on the touch.  This is the first full speed full match most of them are playing, plus the weather/pitch probably didn't help. I wouldn't worry about the touch so much, it'll come with time.  I'm more worried about how the team looked no better than last year.  We really struggle to create chances and break down a team who is bunkered in.  I worry it'll be more of the same this year."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,thelostdolphin,3,Sun Mar 8 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"Don't know if it is the injury or what, but Williams is not the player he use to be. Less strength with his throw-ins, terrible crossing, he looks a lot slower. He looked gassed by the end. (It was a long game.) I use to love Williams, but Gaddis should have his spot. We need a LB. Bleh. I think Gaddis looked pretty darn good at LB too. He's certainly increasing his value. He's even starting to cross with his left. (Which looks better than Williams crossing with his right.)"
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,get_down_mrpresident,3,Sun Mar 8 09:06:56 2015 UTC,I am in total agreement. I have said for a year or two that something is wrong with Sheanon. This is season 6 for him and I see little to know development. He seems to have lost some speed. His service was poor (why even lob in crosses with both CB's are 7 feet tall). I think we should acquire a true LB like Corey Ashe from Houston. And have Ray Gaddis challenge Williams for the RB spot
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,magnumbbrown,3,Sun Mar 8 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"In all but about 15 minutes early in the first half when we had them on the ropes, we gave Colorado way too much time to get in defensive position when we had possession and that's why, when they went down to 10 men, we didn't see a particularly noticeable change or extra vulnerabilities to exploit.   That was especially the case with Wenger, imo. Instead of crisp passing and fast crosses in, he'd be cute with the ball as two defenders closed in on him in the corner and when he did manage a cross in, you could see it coming a mile away because of that extra time he took on the ball.   We need faster, more aggressive decision making as we get into that final third. The good thing is that I'm optimistic that will happen with more real game experience as a unit.   Also, if a header from Casey wasn't spectacularly saved or if Le Toux's earlier one was on target, if a pass from Le Toux wasn't a bit behind Fernando, or if the goddamn ref had grown a pair and called handball in the box, we would have won. That's just the way it goes sometimes, but the things I mentioned above should increase the amount and quality of shots on goal, which can only improve our chances of scoring.  A mixed bag on defense. Gaddis, as expected, was hustling like crazy, Williams looked alright, but I need to see more to really get a sense of how he looks compared with last season, and Vitoria is going to be a huge asset. I already feel confident when he's defending or distributing the ball. White makes me very nervous still. His defending was okay, but he made some silly mistakes that, against pretty much any team besides Colorado, would have been exploited. But it's only one game, so I'm not freaking out.   All in all, a draw is pretty ""meh"" but a point is a point and in a division that I think will be pretty tight (aside from maybe Columbus running away with first place), it could prove valuable."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,in_the_against,2,Sun Mar 8 15:39:36 2015 UTC,We should've gotten so much more out of that game. Also the ref missed a few pretty clear penalties. Overall 5/10 meh
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sat Mar 7 23:11:05 2015 UTC,That was some weak tea
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,mtommyboy,4,Sat Mar 7 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"This was Curtin's loss.  We sent out a team with no strategy, or motivation to do anything.  Even up a man, and tied, we played like we had the lead to protect.  We had no playmaker, or thought process about how to score a goal.  And then we wait until the 85th min to make our final two subs.  If we are going to play two strikers, they need to play off each other, which Fernando and Sapong did not.  And if we play two strikers, Chaco cannot be the guy who is sacrificed to the bench."
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,MrChips217,4,Sun Mar 8 01:45:58 2015 UTC,This was Curtin's loss. We sent out a team with no strategy... And then we wait until the 85th min to make our final two subs.   I agree for the most part. I think the strategy with the two strikers was to high press the Rapids' D and force some turnovers.  That didn't work out obviously and Curtin was forced to make the halftime sub probably mainly due to Sapong getting hurt I'm assuming.  And yeah I think he waited way to long to get Casey and Pfeffer int he game once we went up a man.  We really had no idea how to break down a packed in D.  I saw Le Toux make the same runs as Aristeguieta multiple times which ends up freeing up nobody for a  pass. Casey needs to come on earlier to just bang in the box like he does.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,truckloadof4skin,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:03:32 2015 UTC,"I thought the 2 striker formation looked good.

PhillyUnion,2ya9id,spqr-king,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:22:46 2015 UTC,That game was disappointing. We have to much talent on this team to not be scoring goals. We looked way more dangerous in the second half with maidana playing.   I would rather see edu play as a CB over white. He seemed lost out there on a couple of occasions.  That being said for the first time in a while im excited too see the union take the field.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,TJunior1014,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:37:09 2015 UTC,A lot of it was that Ethan was forced to cover for Sheanon's shit positioning which made Ethan look bad.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Mar 8 12:58:51 2015 UTC,It could have been totally derailed with a loss so I will reserve my opinions until a few games in so the boys have time to mesh.
PhillyUnion,2ya9id,funkyquasar,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"I think the good thing to take away from this game is that we completely dominated Colorado in every facet of the game except for goals scored, obviously.  I agree with many of you that the 4-2-4 or 4-4-2 formation did not go as planned and did not create many scoring opportunities.  You could definitely make out an improvement in ball movement and scoring chances as soon as Maidana stepped on to the field -- he seems to be key in generating key passes and moving the ball forward.  Ultimately, the game was very MEH but I stay optimistic because the team still needs time to gel with the new pieces and the East is so, so weak."

PhillyUnion,2ya9id,dzfooty,5,Sun Mar 8 03:38:23 2015 UTC,"WhoScored gives aggregate scores based on match events that have a set value.  Le Toux recorded 3 interceptions, 3 key passes (passes that led to shots), and had 3 shots. He also had no dispossessions and no bad touches.  That's usually good enough to get you a 7.1 rating.   This was a case of someone padding the stat sheet but not passing the eye test. There are a bunch of WhoScored stars that don't pass the eye test. One player that is like that is Victor Moses of Stoke."

PhillyUnion,2ya9id,TheDuckyNinja,2,Sun Mar 8 04:49:58 2015 UTC,It's kind of useful to compare the stat sites. If you use Squawka they offer a completely different analysis with the same stats. Squawka ratings tend to favor attack-minded teams so they won't give credit to Colorado for keeping a clean sheet (unlike WhoScored) due to Philadelphia's poor finishing.  If you look at the ratings for this match under Squawka the worst player for Philly was Wenger with 1.5/5 stars.

PhillyUnion,2ya9id,thewizardofosmium,-1,Sun Mar 8 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"Just got home from the game.  Thoughts:  -Fire Curtin.  I'm not even joking.  Anybody who thought that starting Sapong was the best option this team had shouldn't be managing soccer at any level.  Even worse was starting him AT THE SAME POSITION AS NANDO.  They spent 45 minutes running in to each other before that concussion (is that what it was?).  That was some of the worst managing I've ever seen.  At the very least, move Sapong somewhere else, don't let them literally run in to each other for 45 minutes.  -Le Toux simply was not good enough today.  A few more performances like that and he has to be replaced.  Simple as that.  Both from the run of play and from set pieces, nothing he did today was good enough.  -Somebody other than Maidana and Wenger need to create, and both of them need to be starting and playing as many minutes as possible.  Not starting Maidana was just as dumb as starting Sapong.  I don't know why Curtin doesn't like Maidana, but he needs to get his head out of his ass.  -There were way too many bad giveaways.  Colorado is a terrible team and couldn't take advantage of them, but everybody on the team has to be cleaner going forward.  -The parking situation wasn't fixed even a little bit.  That was almost as disappointing as what took place inside the stadium."

I honestly don't understand how almost everyone is saying 9th or 10th place finish. I'll admit our subs are a bit weak but that isn't gonna be the reason we miss the playoffs...I don't think.

PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,rabidfrodo,10,Fri Mar 6 14:51:03 2015 UTC,Just bought partial season tickets for the girlfriend. The drive won't be as lonely now.
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,thelostdolphin,5,Fri Mar 6 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, with opening day in mind and the squad that's been assembled over the past couple months, list 3 players:  1) The player you feel most confident about  2) Least confident  3) Most curious/cautiously optimistic about  Mine would be:  1) Maidana  2) White  3) Aristeguieta (I'm cheating, but also Casey in his new role as potential super sub)"
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,Dean_Moriarty,7,Fri Mar 6 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"1) The player you feel most confident about   Wenger.  I feel confident in saying he will have a break out season and be one of the most consistent players for the Union this year.   2) Least confident   Carroll/Lahoud.  Those two are currently our only options to backup Edu.   3) Most curious/cautiously optimistic about   Edu.  I preferred Edu last year at CB, partially because I just thought he played so much better there, but also because I thought Okugo paired better with Noguiera at CM.  I thought the roles were clear with Okugo CDM, Nogs CM, and Maidana at CAM.  I like having one guy who protects the backline at CDM.  However Edu plays more like a CM just like Noguiera.  That can cause confusion about who has to hang back and also limits the amount of time that Nogs can get forward.  I'm caustiusly optimistic about the Edu/Noguiera pairing because now this is their second year playing together and they know that they are definitely the first choice CMs together.  So hopefully they are more familiar with each other and can play off/with each other better than they did last year.  If they can, the upside for those two as a pair is higher than any combo we had last season."
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,rabidfrodo,3,Fri Mar 6 17:09:49 2015 UTC,Interesting take on number 3. I don't disagree at all just interesting to hear the argument I gave for Noguiera for Edu. These guys could be one of the better CM pairings in the league if they are able to play off each other.
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,rabidfrodo,3,Fri Mar 6 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"1) The player you feel most confident about   Nogs I know he is hurt, but fit the whole season his game fits with this team and his game will fit very well with a good striker and consistent partner in the midfield.   2) Least confident   M'Bohli just going with starters he hasn't put strong performances together. He looks great one game then sub par the next.   3) Most curious/cautiously optimistic about   Pfeffer, Jimmy, Ctatic they are young players that look to get some minutes. Hope they perform well which gives the team depth which we lacked prior."
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,Mike81890,2,Fri Mar 6 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"Funny thing to remember about Catic is that he's actually a month younger than Aristegueta. I know he's a rookie, but he's been playing for a while. I hope he adjusts quickly and uses that experience."
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,rabidfrodo,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:06:55 2015 UTC,Agreed more young in experience. The miles on a players legs plays a part in how long they play.
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,Mike81890,2,Fri Mar 6 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"This whole answer is going to sound weird, but:   1) Most confident   The defense. Gaddis is great, Williams is going to have a good year, Vitoria is as good as people think, and White isn't as bad as people think. When you compare the expectations on them to how I think they'll perform, the defense will surprise the most.   2) Least confident   The midfield. What? That's crazy! How could you say that? Well Nogs is hurt and he took a few games to get going last year. It might be a quicker start up but for me, he ain't Drake. 0 to 100 not very quick at all. Maidana looked disinterested in preseason and I'm concerned about his work rate: production ratio. Edu is supposedly an elite player, but he's looked decidedly averages during spells last year. Very cautious about our ""playoff-level"" midfield.    3) Cautiously Optimistic   the fringe guys. Another weird one, I know, but I think Fred, Pfeffer and Jimmy, and Wenger are going to surprise people off the bench and with spit starts. Lahoud isn't as bad as people make out either. Last year in the open cup he showed flashes of quality that I think will become more consistent with a clearly defined role. Wenger looked good in preseason and from what I hear the kids are performing well too. I'm excited for the guys with no expectations on them."
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,rabidfrodo,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"I think the defense will be good unsure of them being top on day one. More to do with the rest of the team focusing on their roles and maybe a bit lazy on helping out.  I'm confident in the midfield. Ya Nogs is injured which won't be great, but I think the comfort level is there that was missing last year and each player will play in a role mute suited to their style. Also Pfeffer looked great and can spell players in the middle this year so bringing someone up to fitness can take a bit longer."
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,Luzzi15,2,Fri Mar 6 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"1) Wenger - he became a totally different player after the move to LW, imagine how much he's improved with a full offseason playing there  2) White - It would be easy to pick a bench player like Fabinho or Carroll, but I'll stick with the starters. White seems like the weak link right now and is the most hot or cold defender we have.  3) Vitoria - I don't know why, but I think he'll be solid here. It would be nice to have a set defensive pairing going into the season instead of having the revolving door of defenders like last year."
PhillyUnion,2y4zf0,Timothy-H,2,Fri Mar 6 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"1 ) Wenger. The ""Target Winger"" is poised to breakout this year.  2) White is the easy answer.  3 ) Sheanon Williams. I'm a believer of his abilities offensively and on defense."

PhillyUnion,2y1d3w,drewuke,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:05:20 2015 UTC,I honestly can't tell.  The signatures are hard to read.  The ones that are signed with roster numbers still really don't give me a clue as to who it is. For instance the one signed with 11 as the number in no way looks like Andrew or Wenger. I'm even having difficulty deciphering what some of the number are.

Curtin seems to know exactly what buttons to push for players and fans. Weather should be better than our last home opener. Try and find a negative I just can't.

PhillyUnion,2xzbm2,Iwaspromisedjetpacks,3,Thu Mar 5 02:57:20 2015 UTC,"It's in fashion to say that New York and Philly don't have a rivalry, but I completely disagree. The fans are still antagonistic towards each other no matter what you want to call the relationship.  As for why there is no Cup, Philly fans, especially those of us on Big Soccer, have been pushing to start an I-95 Cup with New York, D.C., and New England for years. The Revs fans are the only ones keen on the idea while the other two are convinced this isn't a proper rivalry. Unofficially, we track it on Big Soccer.  Keep in mind, most of those other rivalries have been going on for years.  As for other teams, we have slight rivalries with KC and Seattle."
PhillyUnion,2xzbm2,FlapjackJackson,2,Thu Mar 5 04:00:13 2015 UTC,"This may be asking a bit much but could someone post standings for the i95 cup this season. Fan support is what created the Union in the first place, maybe between us and the other fans we can make this a real thing. I don't know how many viewers BS gets as I'm not on it but it seems reddit may have higher traffic"
PhillyUnion,2xzbm2,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:25:10 2015 UTC,"BS's Union forum is far more active.  Like I said, Red Bulls and United fans don't have an interest in this. Only New England does, and we don't have a rivalry with them."

PhillyUnion,2xzbm2,thanksbastards,2,Thu Mar 5 03:52:17 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, we haven't won enough to have a legit rivalry with anyone yet. Hopefully starting this year we become a perennial playoff contender because wins and losses on that stage, where they really mean something, are what inspire strong feelings towards other teams and where rivalries develop organically.   Eagles and Cowboys have destroyed each other's playoff chances. Phillies stepped over the Mets and went on to win the division and then the World Series. That's how rivalries happen."
PhillyUnion,2xzbm2,9guy,2,Thu Mar 5 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"Because we don't ACTUALLY have a rivalry with NY. I don't think our teams generally don't get along more than any other team. At this point I'd say our biggest real rivals based on history is DC and KC. DC and NY already have the Atlantic Cup, so there's no real place to squeeze into there."
PhillyUnion,2xzbm2,thanksbastards,5,Thu Mar 5 03:02:09 2015 UTC,It's more of a natural rivalry between all Philadelphia and New York sports teams rather than any specific history between the Union and Red Bulls.
PhillyUnion,2xzbm2,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:22:10 2015 UTC,yeah but it's a manufactured fan rivalry for the blogs and media. It's a whole different level when the teams themselves just can't stand each other on the field.

PhillyUnion,2xxb9u,FerrisWheelJunky,7,Wed Mar 4 17:19:10 2015 UTC,"The parking is about the same anywhere. No matter what, it is going to be a bit of a pain to get out of the parking lot after game. My tip is to park near where they have metal road blocks/gates set up. When the game is over, they move these away and you can be quickly out of the parking lot. You will still need to deal with traffic heading towards 95 or whatever way you go home. When it comes down to it, it is not bad.  Tailgating varies depending on what you are looking for. Other then the SOB tailgate and some other groups, most people just keep to their own group but are nice and will talk to you if you strike up conversation.   My group usually starts heading in 30 minutes before kickoff. That gives us time to go to the bathroom and get to our seats before the anthem.  Everyone is pretty laid back so just show up and have fun."

PhillyUnion,2xxb9u,in_the_against,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I cash park because I don't drive to nearly every game (shuttle from Fado for 25$ or the regional rail) and it's easiest to exit from. I couldn't tell you off tenge tip of my head how much it is, not more than 20$."
PhillyUnion,2xxb9u,SmugMacGyver,10,Thu Mar 5 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"Tailgating is nice.  The Sons of Ben have two options set up for tailgating this year, where you can either pay a flat $16 for all you can eat AND drink, or $8 for all you can eat OR drink.  As it is the inaugural game of the season, it is also the Stache Bash.  All proceeds raised from this tailgate will go to Philadelphia Unified Soccer of Special Olympics.  The tailgate will be taking place in the SOB Lot located just inside of Lot C.  There's a party on the plaza right before the game usually, you really can't miss it.  There will be almost-street food vendors there and it's easy access inside.  As far as traditions go, outside of The River End there really aren't many, but we do have a few chants that will spread across the stadium as the season ticket holders have been there with us from the start.  For the Anthem, the stadium sings it, so I hope you don't have bronchitis.  Bathrooms will be packed at halftime, so if you can hold it, do so. I believe they used to have a system where you can have food from inside the stadium delivered to your seat, but I'm not sure if that's still running.  Biggest advice I can give is to dress warm.  It's on the river, temps are expected to peak at 42 during the day, meaning expect a realistic temperature of 26 at night time.  You might want to conveniently forget your scarf so you can pick up one of the great ones that will be available at the Union Pro Shop.  If you'd like to purchase tickets to the Stache Bash, you can do so at sonsofben.ticketleap.com."
PhillyUnion,2xxb9u,xenoletum,2,Wed Mar 4 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"Additional points:  If you are coming from Center City, you can get a ride on one of the Fado/Brauhaus (do they still do that?) buses for under $30 to and from the game with tailgating and drinks included (beer, and you can BYOW(hatever)). Gone with Fado people for the cup final, loved it, will do it again soon.  They stop selling beer around 70th minute, sucked, especially when final went into extra time.  DOOP!"

PhillyUnion,2xv91l,thelostdolphin,4,Wed Mar 4 06:34:04 2015 UTC,700 Club is likely an option. Maybe Brauhaus Schmitz.
PhillyUnion,2xv91l,thelostdolphin,5,Wed Mar 4 06:35:25 2015 UTC,Depends on where you are.  Brahaus Schmitz or Fado in Philly.  Iron Abbey in Montco.  Stoney's in Wilmington.

PhillyUnion,2xu01f,akuller,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:54:23 2015 UTC,They seemed high on him but he has been injured for a while. I think we may sign and loan him to HCI.
PhillyUnion,2xu01f,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Tue Mar 3 21:55:59 2015 UTC,From the limited amount of him I've seen Ayuk looks like he's definitely got some promise and it looks like the team thinks so too.
PhillyUnion,2xtqxa,JoeBenzon,4,Tue Mar 3 20:34:00 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's due to the weather.
PhillyUnion,2xtqxa,bduff116,3,Tue Mar 3 21:01:21 2015 UTC,All new reports are here in the /r/MLS CBA Live Feed. Prayin a deal gets made!
PhillyUnion,2xtqxa,get_down_mrpresident,2,Tue Mar 3 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"Fiancé spun out driving home, it's weather. I expect a deal to be announced Friday morning, with no free agency. Honestly the players/owners need to work it so that free agency means instant money once the league breaks from single entity so that everyone automatically wins. When the league gets to the point where everyone is makin money and the owners start to clamor to bid on the same players that's when the league will make the move to institute it to avoid lawsuits like the ones that created it in the NFl"
PhillyUnion,2xtqxa,flyersboys3,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"The news facing a strike had been, from what I've heard, that they are still going to play. There had been rumors floating that if there isn't an agreement met that they will play under the old CBA while working on agreements for the new one for a couple months. Expect the season to start on time"
PhillyUnion,2xseqy,DrewGo,5,Tue Mar 3 14:33:23 2015 UTC,"If they rise to the occasion, that means a top two seed in the East. If not, they'll spend another November watching soccer instead of playing it.   A little too optimistic for my blood but if this team can fire on all cylinders for a majority of the season I don't see why they can't finish top 4. A playoff spot definitely feels like a possibility but the season is long so we'll see.  If nothing else I wonder if Curtin is going to want to go all out for the Open Cup and avenge the loss. I would take that and call the season a success."
PhillyUnion,2xseqy,--smokeandmirrors--,5,Tue Mar 3 16:05:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. I want open cup final revenge against Seattle and a playoff spot. Everything else is just a bonus.
PhillyUnion,2xseqy,thelostdolphin,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:20:29 2015 UTC,It's sort of too optimistic and too pessimistic all at once.

PhillyUnion,2xsw1m,Dean_Moriarty,3,Tue Mar 3 16:58:16 2015 UTC,"He brings something very different to the table (unless they actually bring up McLaughlin) in ability to take someone on through the dribble. Both LeToux and Wenger just try to run past people, but that leaves the problem of doing something with the ball once they run into the endline.   I agree. Sign him and give him some HCI games."
PhillyUnion,2xsw1m,keystonemike,2,Tue Mar 3 17:20:30 2015 UTC,He definitely showed that skill in one of the preseason matches (I think the fog game?).

PhillyUnion,2xshld,in_the_against,3,Tue Mar 3 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"I have Wenger instead of Fernando as well.  Most at /r/FantasyMLS seem to be going with Fernando.  I think Wenger could be more consistent though. He can get points by scoring, assisting, or I also think he is more likely to get bonuses.  Where Aristeguieta it seems that he will need to score."
PhillyUnion,2xshld,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue Mar 3 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was thinking. With Wenger on the wing, he has the ability to both assist and score goals, so I feel like he could be very valuable. Hopefully for both my Fantasy team's sake and the Union's I'm right!"
PhillyUnion,2xshld,get_down_mrpresident,2,Tue Mar 3 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"I had the same dilemma, but I'm sticking with Wenger for the time being. He ended last year on a high note, whereas Fernando is still a bit of an unknown."

This is only my second season playing fantasy though, so I don't know if that's actually true."
PhillyUnion,2xshld,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue Mar 3 19:06:33 2015 UTC,I'm currently rolling with a 3-4-3 but last year once I had enough cap space to add a few more quality players I mainly went with a 3-5-2.  I just feel like midfielders are more reliable and predictable than forward.

PhillyUnion,2xsfy0,jd158ug,2,Tue Mar 3 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think this may be more of a ""players to watch list""   Players like Finley, Shea, Rivero, even Diskreud are solid players. But are they clearly better than Chaco and Noguiera (I mean, Nogs captained a ligue 1 team for a little while)? Probably not.   And in terms of past success, Le toux with the union has been incredibly consistent. A guy like Kei Kamara has similar production in MLS...  But to be fair, any list like this will be a bit arbitrary. Lets just hope the U can have some break out stars and great team play this year!"
PhillyUnion,2xpgcs,--smokeandmirrors--,4,Mon Mar 2 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for him, but I hope the team (and fans) give him time to settle in. I think he can be great, but looking at preseason, he still has a little while to go to get there."
PhillyUnion,2xpgcs,drewuke,4,Mon Mar 2 21:19:12 2015 UTC,The fact that he's not seen as an immediate starter in the eyes of the team and the fans has me hopeful he'll have plenty of time to settle in and grow.

PhillyUnion,2xpgcs,Too_many_hippos,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:40:22 2015 UTC,I'm a little confused and new to this. I thought that when we picked him in the draft that meant we were basically signing him then and there.   Is that not the case? Were we just sort of testing him out between now and then?
PhillyUnion,2xpgcs,Mike81890,5,Mon Mar 2 21:21:09 2015 UTC,"The team is under no obligation to sign him, but nobody else can sign him either as we has his rights"
PhillyUnion,2xpgcs,rabidfrodo,2,Mon Mar 2 22:30:39 2015 UTC,Same as all other drafts. Team and player have to agree to contract and team has to feel the player it's worth signing.
PhillyUnion,2xpgcs,Ghengiscone,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:10:32 2015 UTC,Yea the draft is ridiculous and means nothing really. They're just trialists til they sign.

Philly plays a style that doesn't match his skillset? was it a weak rookie class? have his abilities diminished? did the level of play in the league increase and he wasn't able to improve? is he a party animal and out of shape, in addition to bad attitude (e.g., making questionable statements to the media)? injuries? what else could it me?"
PhillyUnion,2xpzxp,Allthewaylive215,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well, he played alongside a fantastic player in Arne Friedrich his rookie year. That likely helped him majorly.  Also, teams don't look kindly on you talking shit to the media."
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,LocksTheFox,18,Mon Mar 2 04:05:57 2015 UTC,Trophies - One
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,peewoah1,6,Mon Mar 2 04:30:36 2015 UTC,"While I'm tempered in my expectations when it comes to preseason stats, the one line item I am most optimistic about is the three assists from Sheanon Williams. He's still so young that I think he can be very good in MLS and with his injury issues seemingly past him, I hope to see good things from him this season."
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,thelostdolphin,3,Mon Mar 2 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"I came here to say that as well.  I think the defense will be the x-factor this season, but I think Sheanon will be the x-factor of the x-factor.  Basically, if Sheanon performs similar or better than he did in 2013, we could have a very successful season.  Pre-season stats might be meaningless, but it's definitely an encouraging sign."
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,TJunior1014,4,Mon Mar 2 13:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'm more worried about his defending. Sheanon looked good in the attack in 2013, but he was a major liability in defense that year and last year. I really need to see more effort from him."
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Mar 2 15:34:53 2015 UTC,I'm with you on that. But I'm hopeful that he's in better shape and stronger than he was a couple seasons ago and hopefully a bit smarter when it comes to defending. We'll see...
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"For me, it's less so strength and smarts so much as it is work ethic."
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"When I say in better shape and stronger, I'm talking about work ethic too in terms of how many hours he's putting into his fitness. Though, it's hard to know what was injury-related issues last year and what was motivation issues for why he didn't seem to be as fit as he could be. Assuming he's totally healthy and doesn't have any setbacks, I think we'll see how motivated he is based on how he looks this season."
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,thelostdolphin,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:42:18 2015 UTC,Fernando comes in midway through the Season and scores 4 goals for us.  This is going to be interesting when the season proper starts.
PhillyUnion,2xmvbc,xenoletum,1 point,Mon Mar 2 14:42:28 2015 UTC,If sheanon can find the form he had two seasons ago and provide good service and assists that will be a huge boost. We really missed that last year

PhillyUnion,2xitt7,TaeKurmulti,5,Sun Mar 1 05:33:41 2015 UTC,Third one I think was a good goal I think he was faked out by Casey making the dummy move.

PhillyUnion,2xitt7,Dean_Moriarty,10,Sun Mar 1 04:29:22 2015 UTC,M'Bolhi for MOTM. He looked great out there and was consistent throughout the game besides the one Red Bulls goal.

PhillyUnion,2xitt7,EdBacon,7,Sun Mar 1 02:33:34 2015 UTC,I'm upvoting every soul in here!
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,akuller,6,Sun Mar 1 02:36:54 2015 UTC,I don't ever want us to play a 4-2-2-2 or a 4-4-2 or a 4-2-4 or whatever the hell that was again. Possession and any semblance of a midfield were non-existent tonight.
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,thanksbastards,3,Sun Mar 1 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"the formation is terrible. we are invisible in the midfield, put a lot of pressure on our defense, and basically just chuck balls upfield and hope to start something from there if we can control it."
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,EdBacon,3,Sun Mar 1 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"It was nice to see that the defense was able to hold, so that was definitely a plus with the pretty much 4-2-4 we were running."
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,LocksTheFox,3,Sun Mar 1 03:12:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I wonder if Maidana isn't fully fit yet and that's why he didn't start.
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,9guy,5,Sun Mar 1 02:33:51 2015 UTC,Or its preseason and Curtin is just assing about with different formations. If he settles on something sane next weekend I'll forget about it.
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,LocksTheFox,2,Sun Mar 1 02:35:48 2015 UTC,I think he was maybe looking to protect him from injury and give Noguiera a chance to show match fitness. while getting a look at some different option for the season.
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,--smokeandmirrors--,6,Sun Mar 1 05:58:57 2015 UTC,"Union didn't really press as hard as they did against the Crew, and the goals were really lucky, but the defense looked good aside from Gaddis slipping up at the end."
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,thelostdolphin,6,Sun Mar 1 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that had more to do with our formation set up tonight which really detracted from the midfield. Mo and Nogs were basically asked to do it alone against the entire NYRB midfield while Wenger, Le Toux, Casey, and Nando all looked to go forward."
PhillyUnion,2xitt7,LocksTheFox,3,Sun Mar 1 02:34:39 2015 UTC,More of a 4-2-4 than anything

PhillyUnion,2xclu8,MrChips217,10,Fri Feb 27 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"For a change of pace, even if you don't believe it, make the case why this is the best team we've ever had and why this will be the most successful season we've ever had."
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,Dean_Moriarty,12,Fri Feb 27 14:29:54 2015 UTC,I think our lineup is as solid as ever. For years now we have asked for a competent pacey striker and it looks like we nabbed one. The team seems to be in good spirits and having fun while putting in the effort to make legit runs. I think with our offseason last year we have built a team that will be tough to walk in and snatch points from. Whether or not that translates into a playoff spot is yet to be determined but I am cautiously optimistic.  EDIT: Also look at the redesign of our subreddit...what's not to be pumped about!
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:35:37 2015 UTC,Pacey? Nando seems really slow.
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,FlapjackJackson,3,Fri Feb 27 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"Ya think? I don't think he is a speedster but I thought he looked deently quick with the ball at his feet, from what I have seen anyway."
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,keystonemike,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:37:51 2015 UTC,He seems really slow when running.
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,TJunior1014,2,Fri Feb 27 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll bite. Here are a few really nice things about the current roster:   Curtin does not seem keen on forcing square pegs into round holes. The tentative 4-2-3-1 starting formation plays to the strengths of the roster. I don't expect to see Catic at centerback, nor Lahoud as the CAM. [remember when Keon Daniel played as a ""forward destroyer?"" Ugh.]  Curtin DOES seem keen on coaching game situations. I fucking love him for that. He already did a better job of coaching set pieces IMO, and he was quoted this pre-season about practicing 1-goal-up, 1-goal-down, 2-up, 2-down, down-a-man, etc. This was something that last year's Union REALLY struggled with (and, again IMO, have historically struggled with). We have more than one legitimate starting striker. Moreover, we have a somewhat proven goalscorer who is young (Fernando). When have either of those statements ever been true in the past? This year ACTUALLY might be the year that our homegrowns start to contribute. That is the best way to create depth on a roster. Additionally, I think that some roster competition will keep us more fresh this season. Guys like Nogueira probably will need a bit of a break. If you can cycle him, Maidana, Pfeffer, McLaughlin around (possibly with formation tweaks), you benefit later on in the season. We got big. Fuck yes. This is MLS and you occasionally need to get physical. We can play 4-4-2 if needed. Fernando has size, Sapong and Wenger are both strong, Casey can still bang a bit. Our 3rd CB (Marquez) has size (and has already scored on a header) and can pair with Vitoria if need be. That pairs very nicely with a few players that can provide dead ball service, as well as the hope that Williams regains a bit of attacking form. We have a very good goalie and a solid backup (or two). Hopefully no drama occurs.   Caveats:   LB. Ray is a liability in the air and does NOT pair well with Wenger. Fabinho has looked terrible in pre-season, and that's not far off from his peak performance. CDM. If Edu went down, there is a real problem. Lahoud cannot be relied on for starting duty and Carroll probably can't go 90 anymore. That means (at the best case) wasting a sub on CDM in each game. Also, Edu must choose his spots to go forward more judiciously than last season."
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Fri Feb 27 23:24:29 2015 UTC,"Amen to this -- it might be all of my feelings about the upcoming season rolled up into one comment.  Ultimately, I believe it comes down to depth and injuries.  But the point about size is key.  More height + set pieces = more goals (or alternatively, more height on defense + set pieces = less goals)."
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,oestre24,3,Sun Mar 1 03:43:54 2015 UTC,I don't know about most successful. But definitely the best team. We're in a more competitive league than ever.

PhillyUnion,2xclu8,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:56:44 2015 UTC,Yikes...  The other thing to keep in mind is that this isn't necessarily ownership vs a bastion of solidarity among all players. Some of the highest paid players are foreign athletes new to the league and don't have the vested interests that others may have. They may just really want their paychecks while another subset may be adamant about free agency while another group just wants a reasonable bump in pay and to get on with it. We really don't know.

So, I guess I'm worried now haha.    I don't see how they can avoid a strike at this point.  No way the owners give them free agency, and players pretty much have to strike now or else they lose all credibility for future negotiations. Hopefully the owners are willing to compromise enough to avoid a strike."

I've considered putting Vitoria in my starting XI for the simple reason that he may be our PK guy, so more points than usual for a defender, but how likely is that with Le Toux already so solid in that role?

PhillyUnion,2xclu8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:36:14 2015 UTC,It's really about value and what you can afford. I guess you'd have to compare other similarly priced players at the same position.
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,Dean_Moriarty,2,Sat Feb 28 02:54:55 2015 UTC,I picked up Edu and Mbohli because I know both of them are gonna be getting minutes and I think Mbohli is going to break out this year big time.  EDIT: Just threw Fernando in the mix because at 7.5 I think his value will rise which means I can sell later...Right now I have Zardes and Villa up top so it may be hard to break the productivity they create.
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:04:50 2015 UTC,I think M'Bohli is a good call. I was considering him for awhile but priced myself into a corner because of other changes I made and had to go with a $5 keeper instead of $5.5.
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,FlapjackJackson,2,Fri Feb 27 16:34:06 2015 UTC,Yeah here is my lineup at this point...I have no problem posting it as it will probably change considerably.

PhillyUnion,2xclu8,notnewton1,2,Fri Feb 27 16:43:18 2015 UTC,"I have M'Bolhi.    I had Vitoria but recently switched him for White to save some money.

Wenger is probably the smart move.   I've never done fantasy anything before, but this budget is ridiculously tight and definitely forces you to make hard decisions, but it's kinda fun too and I feel like I'm getting to know players from other teams I normally wouldn't think twice about."
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,squid919,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I'm thinking our D will be good this year so I don't mind doubling up with M'Bolhi/White.    I'm also big on Wenger and at $7.5 i think is a really good price.  And Pfeffer is one of the best value plays I can find.  Edit: This is what I'm rolling with right now"
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:02:42 2015 UTC,"Nice line up. I'll edit my top comment with mine shortly.   I agree with you about the value of Wenger and Pfeffer.  I'm actually the most worried about our D. I'm not feeling negative, but just sort of neutral. I'm not 100% confident in White, Vittoria is a question simply because he's brand new, and I want to see some good chemistry (and communication) between M'Bohli and the backline. If our defense does gel though, I feel pretty good about this season."

PhillyUnion,2xclu8,cmills1,4,Fri Feb 27 14:39:28 2015 UTC,"I can't say I have had these criticisms before, but I for one would like to change the perception that the board isn't conducive to discussion.

PhillyUnion,2xclu8,6NippleCharlie,2,Fri Feb 27 15:00:31 2015 UTC,I haven't been to a game because it's a hassle to get there from center city using public transportation.  Am I missing something?
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,thelostdolphin,12,Fri Feb 27 17:30:00 2015 UTC,Like in terms of missing action at the stadium? Yes. Games are a lot of fun and PPL is a fantastic stadium.
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,keystonemike,5,Fri Feb 27 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"The atmosphere at PPL Park is fantastic, nothing like a live game.  I'd say it is worth the hassle for one game as an experience and then you can better gauge if it's something you want to do more often or not.  I know a lot of people take the train to Chester, and then there are shuttles that take you from the station to the park and back again."
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,LocksTheFox,2,Fri Feb 27 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"I've been considering doing the SEPTA + shuttle thing, especially now that I work in the city and have a zone 3 pass anyway... wouldn't cost me anything extra. However I have heard the shuttle is not the greatest. Can anyone confirm/deny? Not trying to get stuck in Chester..."
PhillyUnion,2xclu8,LocksTheFox,2,Fri Feb 27 15:31:41 2015 UTC,I traveled to and from the Open Cup final this way last year. Considering the match went into extra time the shuttles were making it just on time back to the station for the last train. That said the train did actually sit there for a good while to make sure everyone who needed to could get on. I've been able to get to two whole matches so far both using SEPTA. I wouldn't travel there any other way honestly.

PhillyUnion,2x53ik,MrChips217,2,Wed Feb 25 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"I usually do post-match, so yea I can still do that."
PhillyUnion,2x53ik,drewuke,2,Wed Feb 25 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"We can probably automate some of these.  I'm pretty sure /r/Fitness automates their weekly threads. Not sure how they do it, but it shouldn't be too hard to automatically post the Fantasy and Free Talk threads.    The pre-game threads might be different as game times and game days aren't necessarily as regular.    Post game threads should be the easiest, whoever thinks of it first after the game just post up the thread."
PhillyUnion,2x53ik,Dean_Moriarty,3,Wed Feb 25 20:26:09 2015 UTC,I am pro automation that mean less work for the mods
PhillyUnion,2x53ik,akuller,2,Wed Feb 25 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"yeah I have no idea how to automate threads either! /u/drewuke said he would have no problem posting post-game threads, but if he happens to forget or something putting ""Post Match"" in the title should change the color of the thread title."

PhillyUnion,2x10y1,Dean_Moriarty,6,Tue Feb 24 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully for both Berry and the Union the loan is successful, but still pretty ridiculous that we couldn't find a buyer for him."
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,DrewGo,4,Tue Feb 24 20:31:55 2015 UTC,I agree. Did his stock really drop that low while on the bench? I read that FC Anyang is a 2nd Tier Korean team. I find it pretty hard to believe that Berry couldn't still be a starter in the MLS.
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,thelostdolphin,7,Tue Feb 24 21:13:02 2015 UTC,Anyang
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,NaranjaEclipse,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:28:57 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm surprised someone in the NASL or USL didn't take him
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,keystonemike,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:57:36 2015 UTC,Any idea when we have him under contract until?
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:37:15 2015 UTC,Nah I'm not sure.
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,dokool,2,Wed Feb 25 03:41:13 2015 UTC,"This is pretty interesting. Across both the first and second tier of South Korea's K League, there are only 37 non-SK players (predominantly Brazilians) currently on squads, no non-South Koreans on FC Anyang, and since the inception of the K League in 1983, only one American has ever played in it; a guy named Jeff Yoo, who made 5 appearances 15 years ago.   So this is a pretty unprecedented move, which makes the whole thing even more curious as to how it even happened in the first place."
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"Agents pull off all sorts of weird moves, especially in Asia.  SK's second division isn't necessarily better than the MLS on a technical level, but the first division (K League Classic) is. In terms of play style Korea is a bit more ruthless than Japan, for example, which makes it a potentially good league for Americans used to more physical play.  Don't knock Asia; a lot of these leagues have been around longer than the MLS and it shows in player development."
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,dokool,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:35:24 2015 UTC,"No one is knocking Asia... I was just commenting on how unprecedented this move is when considering the context of the league and team he's going to. Considering this is only the second American to ever play in South Korea since the formation of the league back in 1983, I guess you're referring to agents from other countries and not the US pulling off weird moves to Asia (unless there's a large contingent of Americans in another Asian league that I am just not aware of)."
PhillyUnion,2x10y1,thelostdolphin,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"From above,   I read that FC Anyang is a 2nd Tier Korean team. I find it pretty hard to believe that Berry couldn't still be a starter in the MLS.   &   Honestly I'm surprised someone in the NASL or USL didn't take him   Don't get me wrong, I totally understand it if MLS fans are knocking Asia because as a whole less than 1% could even tell you what the leagues are called. I'm just saying they shouldn't.  Edit in response to your edit:   I guess you're referring to agents from other countries and not the US pulling off weird moves to Asia   I mean, agents in general. Once you drop below top-tier European leagues you're basically emailing hotmail addresses and hoping for the best sometimes...   (unless there's a large contingent of Americans in another Asian league that I am just not aware of).   There aren't, but there should be! There were a couple Americans who signed for J2 sides a year or two ago but they never played, and a handful of female American players have played in Japan's Nadeshiko League."

PhillyUnion,2wrgo8,Keepa1,3,Sun Feb 22 22:58:34 2015 UTC,as for right now yes it will be just those 3. I wanted to keep it simple because having 10 teams on the side really made the sidebar larger not to mention the idea of me updating everybodies standings is just something that I don't want to get behind on. I can play with some more tables and maybe by kickoff I Can work something out!  EDIT: Ya know what. Whatever I will take on the task if this is going to get enough traction!

PhillyUnion,2wpnko,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:26:59 2015 UTC,Noguiera was withheld as a precaution. The first team was sent out with instruction to play as though they were a goal down. In that respect I thought the 4-2-4 looked good.

PhillyUnion,2wk36o,emptythecache,4,Fri Feb 20 16:57:30 2015 UTC,You don't pronounce the 'u'. It's only there so you don't pronounce the 'g' like an 'h'. As for the 'ie' it's a diphthong so it's pronounced like 'yay'.  So in all I'm pretty sure it would be ar-ristay-gyay-ta if that makes any sense to someone besides me.  Source: Speak Spanish

PhillyUnion,2wk36o,BissAu,6,Fri Feb 20 16:49:51 2015 UTC,Nice to see it be official. Still waiting to see how this team plays. Can we sustain the form that we held making the run in the US Open Cup or will we look more like the team that blew is playoff chance?
PhillyUnion,2wk36o,rabidfrodo,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:08:10 2015 UTC,No way.  Let him be known as Union Cornelius!
PhillyUnion,2wk36o,AngryHugo,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:11:54 2015 UTC,So if we make the loan permanent does that mean we/ the league don't pay a transfer fee to sign him to a full contract?
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,DrewGo,7,Fri Feb 20 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"Very true. on the defensive end as well, we always tend to give up set piece goals. you can remember that was always one of Zac's weaknesses. Now we have M'bolhi, as well as all the guys you mentioned above fighting to win and clear those air balls. should be solid."
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,Keepa1,7,Fri Feb 20 20:13:09 2015 UTC,M'Bolhi is way more decisive than Zac. Part of why I like him more.
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,LocksTheFox,4,Fri Feb 20 20:27:18 2015 UTC,Except that sometimes he decisively gives the ball to the other team for a one-on-one in a must win game.
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,WildGooseCarolinian,8,Sat Feb 21 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"Or those times that  he gives up 3 goals within 5 minutes to blow a 2-0 lead with 15 minutes to go in a must win game.  Oh wait, that was MacMath."
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,LocksTheFox,2,Sat Feb 21 02:32:01 2015 UTC,"Not saying MacMath was great, just saying I don't exactly have any faith in M'Bolhi either."
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,WildGooseCarolinian,6,Sat Feb 21 02:58:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, MacMath was flawed and M'bolhi hasn't done anything for the Union yet.  No point arguing now, as it will play out this season. Also hard to talk about goalies when our defenders turned into traffic cones at the 80 minute mark of most games last year."
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,drewuke,1 point,Sat Feb 21 04:25:51 2015 UTC,I wish M'Bohli's stats were readily available online somewhere for his years in Bulgaria and Russia.
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,thelostdolphin,2,Tue Feb 24 15:05:33 2015 UTC,Also very true. It'll be nice to be the team getting a late game go-ahead/equalizing goal instead of the one conceding them.
PhillyUnion,2wkf99,akuller,-5,Fri Feb 20 20:29:05 2015 UTC,M'Bolhi has not proved shit as a member of the Union.

PhillyUnion,2wkacy,joinordie2010,2,Fri Feb 20 19:17:38 2015 UTC,Why does it seem nobody wants to admit or at least play into the idea there is bad blood there?
PhillyUnion,2wkacy,MrChips217,3,Fri Feb 20 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"I think the Sounders are our biggest rivalry in the West Coast. We have constantly been compared to the Sounders as the Expansion side that followed them. It so frustrating because we are nothing like them. We came from nothing, they have had some sort of structure to build off of. We are two completely different storied clubs"
PhillyUnion,2wkacy,joinordie2010,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:35:31 2015 UTC,My best guess would be the fan support being a big role in this. The Sons of Ben being one of the biggest supporters on the East coast and well the Sounders supporters pretty much speak for themselves.

Those jerseys are some of the best in the league I think. They are simple, classy, and just plain gorgeous. I think leaving it the way it is not only honors the Union, but also the great history of Bethlehem Steel."

Dude was drifting aimlessy his whole pro career without a set position and all of a sudden after a couple good games at winger he is all our answers.  To me, a period like that is the honeymoon period. Not a ""omg future awesome player and all our answers"" period.  The worst part is we've gone through this with players in the past as well."
PhillyUnion,2wg0g4,Dahorah,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:59:59 2015 UTC,No you're not. Did he play well last year...sure at the end he was crucial. Does that cancel out years of mediocrity as a professional....nope. If he can find a way to be more consistent out wide he will be great for us. He has a bit of talent and looks promising in that position. Let's just hope he displays good form and helps us win. I'm done with being burned by expectations.
PhillyUnion,2wg0g4,magnumbbrown,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"I think of him as a nice tool in the box.

If Pfeffer is playing well in camp he could be poised to have a breakout year as a sub, and we're sorely in need of guys who can come in for guy's like Maidana and Nogueira late in the game. Remember how much we had to see Fred last year? I love Fred, but I definitely don't want to have to rely on him to make a contribution this season.   You WANT your back ups pushing your starters. That means we have good depth. We didn't have depth last season and that's what screwed us at the end of the year."

PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,DrewGo,12,Wed Feb 18 15:12:17 2015 UTC,Ummmmm... Guys. Get excited because he was in an awesome Pepsi Commercial.
PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,CouldBeBetterForever,9,Wed Feb 18 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"Well, they addressed two of their biggest needs just like they said they would. Now we wait to see if they were good moves. I'm definitely more hopeful that this season could be successful now."
PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,violacurva,3,Wed Feb 18 16:12:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see how we addressed the CB/CDM need. White, Vitoria and Edu are significantly weaker than Valdes, Edu and Okugo in those same 3 spots. I'm thrilled we finally got a striker but I think we still are in desperate need of a CB or CDM."
PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,Dean_Moriarty,4,Wed Feb 18 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"I don't that's a realistic way to view though.  The front office had to have known at least soon after the season was over that they would have to move Valdes.  And you gotta look at Edu as a new signing, he was here on loan last year and we had to pay a lot to Stoke to complete the transfer this off season.    I think their first option was to have Edu/White at CB, and sign a new CDM to play behind Nogueira.  That fell through so they ended up signing Vitoria for CB, thus pushing Edu back up to CDM. So that's basically two new signings in the CB/CDM triangle plus a new starting striker.  You can argue that last year's trio of Valdes, Edu, and Okugo were better than this year's Vitoria, White, and Edu.  But I'm not sure we can really say that right now, Valdes wasn't very good once he came back.  And everytime Curtin had everyone healthy (which wasn't often), he picked Valdes and White at CB, moved Edu to CDM and Okugo to the bench. So if you look at it like that then it really comes down to if Vitoria is better than Valdes. Which we will find out."
PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,violacurva,2,Wed Feb 18 20:06:26 2015 UTC,Literally the only resources they have put into this offseason was the purchase of Edu (which nobody knows the cost of). Sapong should be considered as our 1st round pick. Vitoria and Aristeguieta are loans (which may eventually cost money but who knows). And then we have a few second round picks. I would hope we have the ability to get 1 more quality player but I don't think that is going to happen.   I believe I am in the minority but I have a huge lack of confidence in White. For a team that claims it wants to win a bunch of 1-0 games I don't see how he can be a starter. I really hope I eat these words because he seems like a likable guy with some promise. I just don't think he is ready yet.
PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,EdBacon,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're in the minority. White is the clear weak spot on the team, even if we hadn't signed Fernando. White is a serviceable young Center Back who might develop into a quality player, but I don't think anyone's expecting big things from him. That being said, we have to be real here. This is a business and they had limited resources. If our two big off-season acquisitions were two CBs or a CB and a CDM the fan base would have rioted. We wanted a striker and they had to deliver."

PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,Genkiotoko,6,Wed Feb 18 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"I know Casey is getting up there in age, but if he's able to just be a game changer type of guy who comes off the bench at the 70th minute and brings some energy and strength late in tight games, I think he could be really effective. You could see the toll all those minutes of playing time were taking on him by the end of last season, but in shorter spurts, assuming he takes to that role, he could be pretty useful."
PhillyUnion,2wbf6h,thelostdolphin,4,Wed Feb 18 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but any guy (Casey) who is willing to take a pay cut due to wanting to play in a city is OK with me."

Our midfield depth consists of Fred, Carroll, and Lahoud, and at CB we'd have to move Edu or Williams out of position meaning any of the above of Fabinho will have to take the field. I'm not particularly comfortable with that. I'd like to see us get more depth on the backline. Maybe Marquez can fit that gap? It still leaves us pretty thin, but its something."

PhillyUnion,2wcaoz,DoubleHappyDave,5,Wed Feb 18 20:47:37 2015 UTC,"The whole spiel about Muelensteen makes me take this whole article with a mountain of salt.  Who cares if he's in Europe?  Isn't that what we brought him in for, to help create a conduit from Europe to the Union.  Who's to say he wasn't instrumental in the negotiations with FC Nantes?  There is a such thing as telephones and the internet."
PhillyUnion,2wcaoz,Mountainhawk98,3,Thu Feb 19 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"I submitted this here because it pretty much summarizes my feelings on the recent signings and the Union Front Office.  Yes, I'm excited that we brought in what I believe to be decent talent to fill huge areas of need, however I always feel like there's missed opportunities - whether it be offloading salaries (i.e. Berry) to free up cap space for even the smallest of signings that would provide actual depth - and I can blame those feelings on the lack of a GM.   Who knows what type of impact Rene Muelensteen has even provided thus far, according to the article he's over in Europe just chilling and collecting paychecks on our expense.  Why is Albright conducting all, or most, of the searches when he's got other responsibilities with the players that are actually here?  Finally, a commenter on that article brought up an interesting theory about the lack of development in Chester and how that has impacted our FO's money situation.  Here it is in full:    nagjs1: My theory (and it’s only a theory) is that the Union were supposed to be a ‘loss leader’ for the larger development of the riverfront site. Original plans had shops, office & restaurant space alongside PPL Park. Ownership would make its money from this, not the team. The combination of the real estate collapse and poor relations with the Chester city government means none of that is happening anytime soon. Any investment in the soccer club at this point – salary, staff, facilities, etc. – is putting good money after bad, so only the bare minimum is done. Again, just a theory so anyone in the know can feel free to disprove.   Sorry for this long-winded post, I just needed to rant.  TLDR: Signings are cool, but the future still looks bleak."
PhillyUnion,2wcaoz,rabidfrodo,2,Wed Feb 18 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the whole real estate item. Soccer teams are known to burn cash and not sure that they'd make so much back on real estate. Even so Construction and development is truly on the up and up in Philly and none of it is being planned in Chester. The big areas are still in the Main Line and in Jersey.  Otherwise I totally agree I've been saying that all week here. This team is getting things done but always seem to be the bare minimum and to late. Valdes gone but only a loan and very late, Okugo let go for very little, MacMath loaned for peanuts because everyone knows we needed to get rid of someone, and Berry six months of nothing until we cut him.  Both signings are loans which isn't bad but happened very late and I think more to do with either the team not wanting to front the cash to sign the players earlier and their unwillingness to take risk. This is also reflected in the current staff which is completely bare bones and bottom dollar. I think Curtin and Albright can succeed but this set up isn't going to help them at all."

PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,keystonemike,3,Tue Feb 17 17:41:28 2015 UTC,And then they talk about how they are definitely going to sign more players thus making it harder on themselves to sell or buy anyone.
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,keystonemike,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:51:12 2015 UTC,it's really sad for a team that wants to play money ball...
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,FlapjackJackson,7,Tue Feb 17 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"I'll say what I said on r/mls, but Berry seems to have an inflated sense of self-worth. Clearly no team values Berry as a starter. If they did, he would be traded by now. Say what you will about this team, but they have done well to accommodate players who want to leave (the Farfans, Valdes, Soumare, Parke, etc.)  How about instead of complaining to the media and staring at his phone, he actually tries to win a starting spot?"
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,rabidfrodo,2,Tue Feb 17 19:22:29 2015 UTC,What do you think he has been doing since June? They guy was told by his agent the team didn't want him instead of actually telling him. This shit would never fly outside of the MLS.
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,FlapjackJackson,3,Tue Feb 17 22:13:09 2015 UTC,It does all the time with fringe players. Look at Vitoria.
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,rabidfrodo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"What a player on a much larger team not having quality then sold? Berry was brought in to be a starter injuries occurred regime changed and he wasn't in favor. Ok no biggie the team could have brought it up better, but then taking six months to trade him or sell him is a but excessive. Especially to the point where they are willing to let him leave training because they don't want him."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,rabidfrodo,3,Tue Feb 17 22:34:48 2015 UTC,"I'm losing a faith in Curtin and Albright. I get they are new to the job, but as ex players I'd hope they understand the kind of position that Berry is in and try to treat him with more respect.  As for Berry the fact that this is the first we heard that he's know he isn't in the team good on him. He truly acted like a pro and made sure to be a good teammate. I'm sad to see his tenure here be this way. The Union has struggled with handling this kind of thing in the past and it didn't reflect well to other players. He deserves to be let go and get a chance to return to his rookie year level."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,FlapjackJackson,2,Tue Feb 17 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"Didn't he say in the article that he isn't going full out in practice? That and this interview aren't very professional.  Generally, this team does well to move players who don't want to be here. It's more reflective of Berry that no one has traded for him yet."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,rabidfrodo,2,Tue Feb 17 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"He said that's why he asked to leave during training camp. Can you blame him? This is the equivalent of telling someone they are being fired and then asking them to work for another month. After a while they're quality of work will drop because they know they are unwanted.  As for giving this interview, he waited since the World Cup ended till now to let it be known that the team have been treating him like a locker room cancer without skill for months. He was very diplomatic about how he talked about the team. He could've said I've been treated unfairly they are ass holes I'm not going to train and actively with against them. He was very understanding why he wasn't traded prior the playoffs. The guy just doesn't want to sign a new lease then get traded the next day."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,goatyhead,3,Tue Feb 17 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"Treating a guys career like this is incredibly bush league. It's clear they've known for months they didn't intend to use him. Fine, try and get a deal but at this point you need to waive him so he can get back to work.  I'm incredibly disgusted if 2 former(and recently mind you) players are behind this. If it's Sak, well, it's about what I expect from him."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,FlapjackJackson,7,Tue Feb 17 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Yo, we accommodate players' requests to move all the time (Valdes, Farfans, Mondragon, Soumare, etc.). The fact that he hasn't moved is more of an indictment that no one seriously wants him.  If we waived him, everyone here would be complaining that we didn't get any value from one of our few trade-able assets."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,goatyhead,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying and I don't disagree. I would have preferred either not telling him he's not in the plans, a dick move but defensible as being part of the business, or trying harder to keep him content enough until you can secure a move.   Keeping him around and making him feel like a captive is about the worst thing you could do. Now he's disgruntled, everyone knows he's available (and for little to free if they wait long enough), and it looks like the FO is more than willing to dick a guys career over for a transfer fee. A fee that they've made non-existent by botching this whole situation."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,Luzzi15,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Okay so Berry is definitely not playing for us again, it seems. This leaves us with Vitoria and White at CB with Edu as an option and Williams as a desperation option.  Are we hoping Marquez moves into the squad?  The team is looking pretty thin defensively..."
PhillyUnion,2w7dg5,DrewGo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"It seems like they are pretty high on Marquez, though that might be just a reason to justify moving Berry.

PhillyUnion,2vzfsx,9guy,1 point,Sun Feb 15 17:20:19 2015 UTC,I'm sure they'd love to keep him as depth at center back. But I don't think Berry wants to spend the year as a backup.

PhillyUnion,2vvtpl,Husher315,3,Sun Feb 15 06:00:23 2015 UTC,"His only real value was his size.  Now that we have 3 bigger body forwards, his value to the U diminished.  Didn't look good in that Jacksonville game either.  Hoppenot's the only small speedy type forward we have now and that's what probably keeps him here.

PhillyUnion,2vvtpl,drewuke,3,Sun Feb 15 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, Wheeler can still have a good career somewhere where a head coach won't monkey him around and mess with his psychy. It can't be, 'you're a striker' one day and 'you're a CB' another.  Wheeler obviously crashed and burned as a defender, but can still be a great striker with the hight that he has."
PhillyUnion,2vvtpl,emptythecache,1 point,Sat Feb 14 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it was reported that Wheeler was the one who wanted a chance at CB, not sure if I 100% believe that."

PhillyUnion,2vt5x7,Dean_Moriarty,6,Fri Feb 13 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"Based on this tweet from him a few days ago a lot of people were assuming it was Leicester.  I've also seen tweets from reporters saying based on various rumors on who we are targeting at striker that it seems Curtin wants a Dwyer/Amerikwa type of player.    So are there any high workrate but shorter younger strikers on Leicester?    I also think a non-Englishmen would be more likely to leave England for the US, so it looks like this guy Jeff Schlupp is the only one that ticks all the boxes.    I know absolutely nothing about him as a player but I hope I'm right just so I can feel like the Sherlock Holmes of Union transfer rumors lol."
PhillyUnion,2vt5x7,dzfooty,5,Fri Feb 13 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not Jeff Schlupp. He's been one of Leicester's best players this season. If Leicester get relegated, he'd be one of the players sold for a high price. Schlupp is also a pacey winger not a striker.  I'm convinced it's Chris Wood. The other forwards Leicester have play on a consistent basis and are critical parts of their attacking rotation. It could be Jamie Vardy, who scored a brace against Man Utd. this year, but I doubt it."
PhillyUnion,2vt5x7,Mike81890,2,Sat Feb 14 07:01:22 2015 UTC,It's not chris wood. I'm told he's a short stocky player.
PhillyUnion,2vt5x7,--smokeandmirrors--,3,Sun Feb 15 14:44:20 2015 UTC,So are there any high workrate but shorter younger strikers on Leicester?   Chris Wood seems to be what the FO are looking at and he's third in line I think or Andrej Kramaric who scored a good amount of goals in Croatia before joinging Leicester are two other potential options I'd like to think.  What other clubs in Europe do we think it could be?
PhillyUnion,2vt5x7,Dean_Moriarty,3,Fri Feb 13 22:35:14 2015 UTC,"I was thinking Chris Wood but he is 6'3"" since he is young and not English. But I was thrown off by the Dwyer comments.  But I'd rather our lead striker be a tall 6'3"" guy."

PhillyUnion,2vsazy,rabidfrodo,2,Fri Feb 13 19:16:39 2015 UTC,This was talked about at the end of last season. Tannenwald said the team was having serious talks about fielding their own USL side in Philly. This would create small amount of revenue from PPL on non game weekends when the MLS team is away. This also allows them to better manage the young players we bring in from academy or elsewhere.   The little cost this includes makes a good deal of sense if they are serious about investing in youth.

As he realizes he can't afford the team anymore he starts to look for someone to buy the team from him.  In an effort to keep the fans interested and coming to games Sugarman and therefore appealing for a new buyer, he invests more than he is comfortable with to keep up with the raising tide, but always only realistically competing for the last playoff spot.  We might get lucky one year and have a surprisingly good team, but we might not. Eventually, 4-6 years from now, Sugarman will not be able to keep up with the ever growing league and he is forced to sell to an investor who can."

PhillyUnion,2vsazy,spqr-king,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:17:28 2015 UTC,Heres my deal and I have said it here and the r/mls they need to put the team in Wilmington DE for a few reasons. One its close to Philly so that covers that. Two Delaware has no soccer teams at all not a single one in any division (other then Bear Fight which could in some weird way be incorporated I guess?) Three the area near the Blue Rocks stadium would be a perfect place for a SSS. Finally DE is notoriously business friendly so it could work out in their financial favor as well. I know a lot of people seem to hate this idea but I wish with every fiber of my being it would happen.
PhillyUnion,2vsazy,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Sat Feb 14 04:52:40 2015 UTC,I think that's a good idea.  But I think a second division team would still play out of PPL for financial reasons.  Are the Union going to want to buy land and build a stadium and field in Wilmington just down the road? Or are they more likely to play out of Chester and forego the other costs while also making a little more/recouping some money by just playing at PPL Park.

PhillyUnion,2vkfq0,DrewGo,2,Thu Feb 12 02:36:20 2015 UTC,fair enough.
PhillyUnion,2vkfq0,yung_swagged_out_mf,3,Thu Feb 12 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"this is by far the weakest team we have ever gone into a season with.   Never forget the horrible days of Keon Daniel starting. Sigh...   But in all seriousness I think you're overreacting a bit. I don't think the team is any better than we were last season (in terms of the roster), but I'm not sure we're any worse either. Everyone writes off last season like it was a complete and utter failure, but we went to the Open Cup Final and almost snuck into the playoffs. All of this was in spite of a terrible start to the season.   Why did we have a terrible start? Because we brought in a bunch of new guys and they needed time to develop some chemistry. Not to mention they had Hackworth trying to force a possession based playing style on a team just not equipped for it. Once Hack got booted and Curtin stepped in, things improved quickly. Jim coached a defense first, counterattacking playing style which suited our players and got us to a final and close to the playoffs.   Now guys like Nogueira, Maidana, Edu, Wenger and White all have a whole season playing together under their belts. We brought in Vitoria and Sapong, but integrating 2 guys into the starting lineup is much easier than integrating 5. We're also going into the season with a coach who seems to know the best system and playing style to fit his roster.   When I ask myself the question ""Is this team good enough?"" I look at two things:    Do we have the depth we need to keep up at the end of the season?  Just how good are all the new players/teams coming into the league?    Depth was the thing that killed our playoffs hopes last season. So the new faces you mentioned... Catic, McLaughlin, Pfeffer, Marquez. Are they good enough to provide the depth we need? I don't know, but I want to give them a shot for sure.   Kaka, Villa, Giovinco, Gerrard, Altidore, Diskerud, Kljestan... these are intimidating names. This is what scares me most. But then again, I was pretty scared of Toronto last season too, and look at what happened there. Marquee players are a great thing for a franchise, but they do not make a championship team. The east is a giant question mark right now with two new franchises and a couple of teams with completely revamped rosters.   I guess the question is... Is a little bit of consistency as bad as we think?"
PhillyUnion,2vkfq0,phancypheetz,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:41:28 2015 UTC,some really good points here! perhaps i am overreacting a bit.  still no true goalscorer on the roster though.
PhillyUnion,2vkfq0,MrChips217,2,Thu Feb 12 18:57:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah. I forgot that part. Casey is too old, Sapong is a question mark, Catic is too young, I don't even want to talk about Wheeler. If this team brings in a really solid striker I'll actually be excited for this season. If they bring in a striker and a CDM and move Edu back to CB? I'll be down right ecstatic."
PhillyUnion,2vkfq0,phancypheetz,2,Thu Feb 12 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"our starting line-up most likely as of now- Sapong, Wenger, Maidana, Le Toux, Edu, Nogueira, Gaddis, White, Vitoria, Williams, M'bohli.  You're telling me thats not an MLS quality squad?  Believe me I'm not happy with the FO at all but this may be the best line-up in the club's history."
PhillyUnion,2vkfq0,MrChips217,2,Thu Feb 12 17:09:08 2015 UTC,"I think our starting 11 is good enough to compete for one of the last playoff spots.  We're not gonna blow anyone away, but not a push-over either.  But depth is definitely a problem.  We're going to need guys like McLaughlin, Pfeffer, and Catic to really step up and be ready to compete this year.  We gotta hope Casey has some legs left.  Sapong has never been the No. 1 striker before.  Wenger needs to continue to develop at LW. And last year's big signings, Edu, Maidana, and Nogueira all had good years last year, but now that they are used to the league, have a full off season and full preseason they need to give us more too.  So I guess I'm in the wait and see camp.  There is definitely cause for concern, but there are reasons for optimism too.  And I still gotta think that Vitoria won't be the only acquisition this year."

The drop off there is unbelievable.   While he may be good, Vitoria has barely played in 2 years so who knows what we are getting. I'd rather get another proven CB to pair with Vitoria or a true CDM so we can move Edu back. If White is starting (which certainly seems to be the case) then I think we will be in deep trouble."
PhillyUnion,2vgty7,violacurva,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"This is pure speculaton, but I think they were trying to get a deal done for a CDM, but because of how long the Valdes crap took they weren't able to. I agree that I would prefer Edu to play CB, but we just don't have another option at CDM right now. With Berry trialing with the Cosmos, his exit is imminent. It looks like it's gonna be Vitoria and White with Edu in front.   The only thing I'll say in defense of the team is this: at 6'5"" there's no way Vitoria isn't a step up in terms of set piece defense, which is an area we have always struggled with."
PhillyUnion,2vgty7,DrewGo,4,Wed Feb 11 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"Half time, and what seems to be our first team still can't score."

PhillyUnion,2vgty7,midwesternhousewives,2,Wed Feb 11 00:36:23 2015 UTC,"Seems like it would be. Hopefully White has a better game than he did last time out. I'd like to see Marquez or Berry given a shot though, but we'll see."
PhillyUnion,2vgty7,pefsu13,2,Tue Feb 10 22:39:39 2015 UTC,Hopefully they sign a real striker and not some half-assed last minute excuse for a signing...
PhillyUnion,2vgty7,spqr-king,1 point,Thu Feb 12 02:00:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like they gave in to Edu's demands about wanting to play midfield and not CB and just didn't tell us.

We played 7/11 trialists in the first half (though one defender ""trialist"" - Takuya Yamada - is an as-of-yet un-re-signed TBR veteran) and 4/11 in the second half, for what it's worth. Your boys in blue completely dominated possession through most of the first half.  Union started looking pretty frustrated as the second half wore on though, dealing out some aggressive fouls. I wouldn't worry too much about this if I were a Philly fan, just as I'm not getting too excited about it as a TB fan.  Going through @TampaBayRowdies and @TheUMatchDay might give a fuller view of the match. Good luck to y'all this year in the big league."

They fell off last year especially, but have a new coach and staff, and look like they're going to be very good this year.  NASL is much better than most MLS fans will give it credit for being, it's a shame more folks don't realize that.

They talk about it , whine about it, and BS about it ad-nauseam  ... just do it.  CJ Sapong is a project, Le Toux (while loved) is streaky and will find ways not to score at the worst times the same for Wenger and Casey. They are support pieces so get a damn DP striker!!

PhillyUnion,2vgcl6,LocksTheFox,5,Tue Feb 10 20:23:14 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of this. I would have liked to see him come back to the Union. I think he could be solid depth in the midfield.
PhillyUnion,2vgcl6,DrewGo,9,Tue Feb 10 20:36:59 2015 UTC,I am not a fan of him going to DCU but I do not want him back on the team. I would rather them give a young academy guy his spot on the depth chart and have the team spend all the money they can on a ST.
PhillyUnion,2vgcl6,MrChips217,2,Tue Feb 10 21:05:23 2015 UTC,I would agree with you if I thought the spot would actually go to Pfeffer or McLaughlin. My guess is we see a whole lot of Cruz off the bench to replace Wenger or Le Toux.
PhillyUnion,2vgcl6,DrewGo,2,Tue Feb 10 22:06:38 2015 UTC,Would've fit well into this system as a winger. Little annoyed to see him in D.C.

It now has about 25 kids who live in the residency program. Good question. I assume 14. Nick talked more about the academy and high school here Quite a few good talents. I'd read this article. This strategy should definitely help in a few different reasons. One, it will provide us some very talented youngsters from one of the major American soccer hotbeds (NJ/PA). If we can bring up a talented youngster or two a year, it should really fill this team out, provide us with good depth, and help us develop starters. Also, we can sell the best talent to Europe and re-invest the money in the team (think how Yedlin worked). It fits the moneyball strategy perfectly."
PhillyUnion,2vfqfm,FlapjackJackson,2,Tue Feb 10 17:50:39 2015 UTC,"Cool, I appreciate it. So is it safe to assume that the high school is for the players they regard the highest?"

Vitoria provides good size in the back and on corner kicks (we take a lot of those), we will have some striker depth with Sapong & Casey, our starting midfield is decent and has a year under their belt to build chemistry, and my only real concern is defensive depth and whoever plays next to Vitoria.  knocks on wood   I see the East playing out like this:   New England Orlando City Toronto DC United/Chicago Fire Columbus/Philly Montreal/NYCFC/NYRB   This is nowhere near accurate or boiled down to one team per playoff spot, but it's kind of where I see teams falling.  Orlando and NYCFC are difficult to allocate due to never having played before, but is just based on the offseason."
PhillyUnion,2vc5rw,TJunior1014,9,Mon Feb 9 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"I think you really underrate Columbus. I'm looking at their roster and I don't see any holes at all.  I'd swap them and OCSC, maybe bump Chicago down because I'm not sold on their back line."
PhillyUnion,2vc5rw,LocksTheFox,2,Mon Feb 9 21:09:29 2015 UTC,I think this might be the year Toronto actually defies history and performs up to their payroll and I feel like New England may have a bit of a regression.

PhillyUnion,2vdnu6,oestre24,3,Tue Feb 10 03:34:24 2015 UTC,The whole allocation thing needs to go away
PhillyUnion,2vdnu6,kyleisgreattt,2,Tue Feb 10 06:31:51 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty new to the mls, what does this exactly mean?"
PhillyUnion,2vdnu6,get_down_mrpresident,6,Tue Feb 10 14:27:05 2015 UTC,"Here is a simple chart to help you understand.  but, in all seriousness. The league has this thing called ""The Discovery List"" where each team can make a preemptive claim on a player prior to them entering the league, and if that player happens to enter the league then they have the first dibs on signing that player or refusing his contract. It seams that the Union bought the rights to loan the player from Vancouver even though he was never a vancouver player. I know it's stupid...if I described this wrong somebody can correct me."
PhillyUnion,2vdnu6,MrChips217,2,Tue Feb 10 15:28:59 2015 UTC,"The only thing I know of that you missed is that to get a player on the discovery list, a team has to make what MLS considers ' a bona-fide offer'. So at some point, vancouver must have approached vitoria, offered him something that MLS considered reasonable(what constitutes reasonable seems to be leagues discretion), and he or his club refused the offer."
PhillyUnion,2vdnu6,arkr,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:22:47 2015 UTC,Oh yeah! Thanks. Which Vancouver did do according to this seattle fan.
PhillyUnion,2vdnu6,MrChips217,2,Tue Feb 10 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"Somehow Vancouver had a claim on this guy or were higher on the list used for deciding who gets first crack at Canadian-Portuguese players. I joke but only a little. I don't fully understand it myself because there are all kinds of rules about player acquisition (discovery claims, allocation order, designated players, Generation Adidas, Home grown player, etc).   Add to that the pretty constant make-this-shit-up-as-we-go nature of things and it's almost completely insane from a fan standpoint.  My advice is to not get flustered and roll with it."
PhillyUnion,2vdnu6,goatyhead,2,Tue Feb 10 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"Well the article doesn't really say exactly but I'm pretty sure Vancouver had a ""discovery claim"" on Vitoria.  Basically the league doesn't want clubs bidding against each other for a player (also relevant for the current CBA negotiations, players want free agency but the league doesn't because they don't want teams bidding against each other).  Anyway, Vancouver was probably interested in signing Vitoria last year so they put a discovery claim on him, but were never able to sign him.  Now when the Union try to sign him, since MLS is single-entity Vitoria actually signs with the league and is then allocated to a team.  Since Vancouver had a discovery claim or the right of first refusal the Union had to trade allocation money to Vancouver so the Union held the right of first refusal allowing them to obtain Vitoria.  And allocation money is basically a mechanism to manipulate the salary cap.  You can use it for example to pay a player's contract.  So if a player if making $150,000 but you are $50,000 about the salary cap.  If you have enough allocation money you can apply $50,000 worth of allocation money to the player's contract and therefore be under the cap and still able to sign the player."

PhillyUnion,2v57fc,LocksTheFox,7,Sun Feb 8 00:32:39 2015 UTC,I thought Pfeffer and Jimmy Mac both showed they should be first teamers this year who can contribute.  Really hard to judge anything though.  Not one of the three lineups was close to a starting 11 and not one of them looked good. And half those guys are getting cut before the start of the season anyway. But depth definitely is a major issue.

I do think that Jimmy Mac and Wenger were very good, Ethan White was very bad, and I don't see Lee or Simmons making the team. Lee got burnt a few times on the left.  I am intrigued by the trialists, though. Nasseri has upside and the Greek is an actual left-footed left back."

PhillyUnion,2v57fc,atypicalclothespin,3,Sun Feb 8 00:54:42 2015 UTC,Well that could have been a lot better but considering its like our first week of preseason it could've been much worse. Just some thoughts.  1) I really hope berry lost a bet and the afro will be gone soon haha. 2) I really liked number 30 in midfield during the last 30 minutes. Anyone know who he was? 3) Wenger looked as dangerous as usual and Carroll was just as bad. Sapong didn't get many chances but he showed potential when he did get the ball. And hopefully we give jimmy and pfeffer a chance during the regular season because I think they can compete with the regular team and at least provide good depth.
PhillyUnion,2v57fc,pefsu13,4,Sun Feb 8 00:41:40 2015 UTC,#30 was Aodhan Quinn

PhillyUnion,2v57fc,midwesternhousewives,2,Sun Feb 8 00:45:33 2015 UTC,"Sapong was really, really bad.  Not only did he lose the ball in his feet multiple times, he was also responsible for the first Armada goal.  Unfortunately, most players ranged from ""mediocre"" to ""really, really bad"".  Luckily, most of our expected regulars looked good or good enough, but we desperately need a striker, we may need to bring in another CB or CDM on top of Vittoria (who feels comfortable with Berry, White, Marquez, Carroll, or Lahoud right now?), and we have serious problems if some of our guys go down.  As for people who we didn't already know are good who stood out from the dreck...um...Quinn I guess?"

PhillyUnion,2v5bme,peewoah1,2,Sun Feb 8 10:28:09 2015 UTC,"So we got Sapong.  Re-signed Casey, Carrol, and Fred.  Lost Okugo in expansion draft.  Put MacMath on loan.  The ""Carlos is back, are you?"" campaign made for some good egg-on-face laughter. Our manager wants the team to play like a bunch of bastards.  FO actually are a bunch of cheap bastards. Fan morale might be the lowest it's ever been.  Sons of Ben got a new tailgate location.  Philly will be hosting the Gold Cup final (slightly irrelevant, but whatever).  We have new training fields (RIP Lot B).  Oh, and STH get their names on their seats, but you're fucked if you have multiple seats on the same account, because ""the text file would be too big if we did a different name on every seat.""  There's the dogfish beer garden, which is likely our best off season signing.  Some (not all) of the Philly media market still ignores our existence, if they even know the team exists at all. The team's marketing department seems to have ditched #Doop for #StandForBlue, and I'd be surprised if anyone in there remembers the original ""Jungite aut perite""  motto.  Edited a word."
PhillyUnion,2v5bme,in_the_against,2,Sun Feb 8 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"In an offseason where the Front Office needed to prove their competence, the fan base is growing more and more skeptical of its ability to do so.    I would talk about how going into our 6th year, we have our 3rd manager, who for the second time is a promoted assistant coach from the previous failed regime.  He seems like he could be good, but has yet to prove so, especially after a late season collapse that left us out of the playoffs yet again.  For me the most puzzling move so far this offseason was protecting Fabinho, a known commodity, over a promising midfielder with size Ribeiro.  This, to me, seemed like a classic Philadelphia move similar to starting Danny Cruz/Brian Carroll over a younger more talented but less experienced player.      We are promised signings, and rumors seem to be going around that they will be coming, but there is not a lot of confidence in the fan base right now.  We were asked to judge the roster in March, which I plan on doing... but I can't say I have too much confidence in anyone in the FO, including Curtin.  I hope to be proved wrong.  With Orlando City and NYFC joining, Toronto signing anyone they want, and some quality moves throughout the Eastern Conference, it is hard to see 2014's 6th place Eastern Conference team making any headway on their attempt to make the playoffs for a second time in franchise history.    I did not renew my season tickets for the first time in club history, and I know I am not the only one.  Again, I hope we are proved wrong."
PhillyUnion,2v5bme,jpoRS,1 point,Sun Feb 8 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what you said, but the late season collapse didn't keep the Union out of the playoffs any more than the early season fuck around."

PhillyUnion,2v5bme,keystonemike,2,Mon Feb 9 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"This is the year that Pfeffer and McLaughlin need to start contributing. Our use of Wenger and LeToux as dual battering rams on the touchline can be very hit-or-miss. It doesn't make sense to have a 3-man midfield of Edu, Nogueira, Maidana if the next pass gets toe-poked 30 yards forward every time. It is too predictable.  I think you can rotate some more skill on the ball into the lineup. Obviously, this is situational.  That brings up a second point: will Curtin actually tailor the 11 (and bench) to particular gamedays? I think we've seen two seasons where there was very little tactical flexibility. Even if a 4-5-1 is our preferred formation, I think there is plenty of room for the occasional 4-4-2 (maybe you give Casey 60 minutes on occasion, partnered with another striker against team's with undersized CBs) or true 4-3-3 (push Maidana wide left - Sapong - McLaughlin... Nogueira - Pfeffer - Edu). That would be a much more passing-intensive lineup."
PhillyUnion,2v5bme,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:43:45 2015 UTC,I feel like we are letting good players go keeping mediocre players and then signing player with potential which is a recipe for disaster. We needed to keep Okugo if we cant keep players of his caliber and potential happy we will never be able to build a competitive team. If we keep signing players like Carroll the same thing. Without a real spending budget we wont be able to compete regularly with the other teams in the league UNLESS we make smart decisions which it doesnt appear we are.

PhillyUnion,2uzm5x,tyme,3,Fri Feb 6 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"Mostly because he's putting a team with limited resources in a really bad spot. He clearly isn't worth the salary to anyone else in the world or it wouldn't be loan after loan. So instead of buckling down and playing his contract out he keeps engineering these stupid moves that take forever.  In the meantime the Union is trying to get the team together for training camp missing one of the most important pieces, a starting CB.  I don't know what his deal is but like others have said Philly sports teams can't have guys that don't want to be here. It's very obvious to the fans and I think they rightly turn on those uncommitted  players immediately."
PhillyUnion,2uzm5x,goatyhead,2,Fri Feb 6 21:35:49 2015 UTC,Yeah they wanted him gone because he wanted to leave. They would not have brought him back if they didn't like him.
PhillyUnion,2uzm5x,ignoramis,3,Fri Feb 6 23:50:26 2015 UTC,Good this seemed to be a hold up on things for us and his constant flux in where he wanted to play was tiring.

PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,oestre24,8,Fri Feb 6 14:29:36 2015 UTC,He takes PK's and is good in the air off set pieces. Odds that the Union front office wants to count him as both our CB addition and our striker addition?
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,tonyny,8,Fri Feb 6 14:31:35 2015 UTC,I just assume we'll be starting him as a target forward and moving Casey back to CB.
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,DrewGo,1 point,Fri Feb 6 14:36:02 2015 UTC,He started his career as a striker and got moved back to CB very quickly.
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,akuller,3,Fri Feb 6 15:42:01 2015 UTC,Still struggling....so Vitoria replaces Valdes....Union are still down an Okugo and up a Sapong....not feeling that. If any starter gets hurt the replacement will be a BIG step down. With apologies to Cruz and Casey.

PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,akuller,1 point,Sat Feb 7 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"Since 2013, Vitoria has only made 7 appearances on Benfica's B team (Segunda Liga) and 1 for actual Benfica. Was he injured?"
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Feb 6 16:08:54 2015 UTC,Benfica has a habit of signing lots of players with high potential then giving up on them if they don't develop as quickly as they wish. They're also stubborn in that they don't really make it easy to loan out their players (this could have something to do with 3rd party ownership). You'll find lots of Benfica players with 1 or 2 caps over a 5 year period.   They've mostly thrived with throwing their trust on Brazilian or Argentinean wonder-kids whose play ends up bagging them lots of money in transfer fees. Its a continuous loop with them.
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,dzfooty,2,Fri Feb 6 19:08:07 2015 UTC,They currently have 12 players out on loan. That's a pretty significant number actually. I'll have to look up their rosters over the past few years to see app stats. Thanks.
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri Feb 6 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that defenders don't have the same weight in the transfer market as midfielders and forwards do. The average lower table club will not waste their limited funds on a center back. Those teams are always lacking attacking talent so they'd rather gamble with young forwards who can get them some goals. Coaches on lower table clubs rely on team defense or tactics in order to compensate for poor defenders.  You'll see that in the case of Benfica, the majority of those 12 loanees are not defenders. 12 is a normal number of loanees for a team that has a lot of players under 3rd party ownership though. Serie A uses a lot of 3rd party ownership and you'll see similar numbers of loans on their squads. The thing with 3rd party ownership is that it hinders loans as much as it promotes them. Since the negotiations involve multiple parties, it makes it difficult to come to any terms. Clubs are obviously willing to curb the process if it means landing a 19-year-old Brazilian forward. When it comes to defense, things get a bit more tricky."
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,dzfooty,1 point,Fri Feb 6 19:27:05 2015 UTC,"Nah, according to Wiki looks like he just doesn't fit in Benfica's plans and has expressed his frustration."
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,JerseysFinest,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:41:10 2015 UTC,So he didn't fit with two team's plans? (Benfica B and Benfica)
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,thelostdolphin,0,Fri Feb 6 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"I would imagine they have the same, overarching plan."
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,JerseysFinest,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"That may be the case, but that also sounds like one of those stock answers managers give to the press as a polite way of saying he wasn't good enough for either the A or B squad. I hope that's not the case, but just sounds like one of those answers. Them only needing to see him play once before shipping him down to the second rung isn't too great and then not even getting much time there is also concerning, imo."
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,thelostdolphin,0,Fri Feb 6 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that Benfica are pretty damn good. Champions League good. Them being fine with letting him go just means he's not Champions League quality. There aren't too many players in MLS that are. From this article that gets poorly translated it appears that he opened his mouth about not playing, which will only hurt his chances of playing anywhere within the club system, A or B."
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,JerseysFinest,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think it's much more likely that he just wasn't up to the caliber of Benfica. Maybe their 2nd tier team is significantly better than MLS as well and that would explain why he couldn't make it there either. Couple that with him complaining, that would make sense."
PhillyUnion,2uzhcg,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Feb 6 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Hey guys. Benfica fan here.  Just to clarify: he's not Benfica caliber, but he's definitely more than good enough to play in our B team.   He doesn't play because the plan for that team from this season on is to develop Benfica's youngsters only. So players that are left out of our main roster don't play in the B team anymore, because those players were taking learning opportunies from our youngsters.  Steven had a disastrous season at Benfica in his very very few games last year but it's very unfair to judge him for that, playing once every 3 months. Before that he was one of the best CBs in the small Primeira Liga clubs and he's a threat in the air in set plays. He's not DP quality or anything but I'm sure he'll deliver in the MLS."

There are plenty of more attackers I have in mind. Most of them Parisians that have ties to M'Bolhi."

PhillyUnion,2v11uj,thewizardofosmium,3,Fri Feb 6 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"One real issue is getting your best 11 on the field. With the FO making a play for another starting-caliber CB, Edu looks to be your number 6 defensive midfielder. I don't think there is any argument that Nogueira is your number 8 distributor, and I personally believe that Maidana is more effective centrally. That doesn't leave room for a 2 striker set-up. (unless you 3-5-2, which could be fun...)  The above notwithstanding, I like that Curtin is not publicly married to any single formation. Obviously, it is not a crime to sit a starter for a match or two, or even to deploy Maidana on the left. There are MLS squads that will be susceptible to the ol' big bodies in the box approach. In that case, I am on board with ugly physical ball that wins 3 points."
PhillyUnion,2v11uj,keystonemike,1 point,Sat Feb 7 03:57:37 2015 UTC,"3-5-2 would be fun, but then you're eliminating Gaddis & Williams from the line up more than likely.  Unless you push them up to be the wings, and that wouldn't be happening.  Like you said getting your best 11 on the field is the most important thing."
PhillyUnion,2v11uj,TaeKurmulti,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"No, I know. I think that both of those guys could play as wing-backs, but I don't think that would be best for either.  I just think 3-5-2 is a fun formation."

PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,keystonemike,2,Thu Feb 5 17:44:06 2015 UTC,Yeah can someone tell me what DP stands for that they're referring to?
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,brinkcitykilla,6,Thu Feb 5 17:53:54 2015 UTC,here's a detailed explanation
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,emptythecache,4,Thu Feb 5 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"DP = Designated Player Basically its a high caliber player with a high caliber price tag. However the league will pick up a portion of that players salary. For example Clint Dempsey, Jozy Altidore, Michael Bradley are all DP's  Every MLS team can carry 3 Designated Players. Unless the rules have changed, and they are likely to with the upcoming CBA. I also believe you are allowed to have a ""young DP"" which is a DP under a certain age."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,joinordie2010,3,Thu Feb 5 17:58:36 2015 UTC,"These guys are correct. My comment was trying to point out that ""DP Quality"" is an extreme range. There has been a panoply of failed DPs in this league, as well as a few that have been absolutely magnificent."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,keystonemike,2,Thu Feb 5 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, I take it for what it is, rumor. That being said, MLS transfers has proven time and time again that they some pretty solid sources that they keep anonymous to protect them.   DP Quality means that they are a player with skills worthy of a DP Salary, I thought that was pretty clear. I'm not saying it's a great measurement system, but it's probably better than their FIFA 15 ranking."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,keystonemike,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to avoid seeing the sub turn into a twitter feed, and ""DP Quality"" could mean anywhere from Thierry Henry to Rafa Marquez... So yea, I was pointing out that people shouldn't get too excited."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,KFCConspiracy,3,Fri Feb 6 00:03:18 2015 UTC,"pipeline to bring in quality international players that might prove to be more valuable in the future than a few new players right now.   Yes the international relationships are important. But without putting out a quality product and changing how people talk about the the team (And the only way to change that is to win games), no one will want to be here. No one wants to join a team that's been mediocre at best for 5 seasons... What will it do for a player, bring his career to new heights of mediocrity?   Vision for the future is important, results in the near term are important, and relationships are important. Without all three the team will continue to have trouble attracting and keeping decent international prospects."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,cuzigothye,2,Thu Feb 5 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly what I am hoping for is that Meulensteen can sell these international players this ""project"" - something much bigger than any one person - that these guys can be apart of. Ideally, we sign the right guys for the project of building up the union, and these ""right guys"" will translate to on-field success. But I am just speculating here from my perspective."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,goatyhead,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:43:37 2015 UTC,I love the idea that there could be someone out there looking to make themselves a club legend by building things up in Philadelphia.

PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,joinordie2010,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:54:59 2015 UTC,I believe ticket sales have little to no impact on how much a professional sports franchise can spend on player salaries. However it definitely makes it less attractive to potential transfer targets.
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,KFCConspiracy,3,Thu Feb 5 15:03:47 2015 UTC,"Uh... Why on earth would you think that? I mean, the team has other avenues of revenue (Advertising, TV deals, etc.) but ticket sales are definitely a huge revenue stream. 17 home games a year (not including friendlies and open cup games), averaging 17,000 fans in attendance. Tickets cost about $30. That's $8.67 million in revenue. And that's before you taken into account concessions and parking. Ticket sales are a HUGE part of how the team turns a profit. If the organization isn't profitable, the investors/league will be less likely to invest in quality players. Ticket sales absolutely have an impact on player acquisitions.    Just look at Seattle. They average almost 45,000 fans at every game. That's how they're able to bring in players like Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,joinordie2010,6,Thu Feb 5 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"I think you meant to say ""that's why the league gives them players like Clint Dempsey by ignoring their convoluted allocation rules"""
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,KFCConspiracy,3,Thu Feb 5 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"Even if the league let us have him, Clint Dempsey wouldn't want to come to the Union."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,DoubleHappyDave,2,Thu Feb 5 15:43:48 2015 UTC,That is a good point. If the MLS wants to bring it world class players they need to offer them more than just money.
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,kyleisgreattt,2,Thu Feb 5 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"But seriously, if this league really wants to be committed to parity it needs to... ya know... actually enforce it's rules that are in place to promote parity."
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,LocksTheFox,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:45:30 2015 UTC,Correct.
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,TweetsInCommentsBot,5,Thu Feb 5 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"Yes true there is sometimes profit from ticket sales, but not enough to make an impact on the transfer market. Do you have any idea how much it costs to run PPL for one season? I'm talking about operating cost such as water, electricity, heat, internet, not to mention the property taxes for one year alone. (Did you know the operating cost of a stadium goes up every 72 days!!!) After you have paid all of those cost you need to pay all of your non-team related employees, such as the people who work in the concession stands and the team store, not to mention all of the team employees like trainers, scouts, facility mgmt and so on. After all of that there is very little left over to dump into the transfer market.  TV Deals, sponsorship's, endorsements, merchandising and advertising is mainly how teams pay for their players. Seattle's Sponsorship deal with Microsoft was more lucrative than our's with BIMBO. Also the sounders share a stadium with the Seahawks which cuts down on their operating costs significantly.     Side Note ( Stadiums and arenas often need to rent out their space to make up the costs of owning and operating a stadium. For example the Wachovia Center is home to two teams the 76ers and the Flyers. They also rent out their arena to other events such as Disney on Ice, Monster Jam, WWE, and the Wing Bowl. This means that their arena is being used for more than the 17 days out of the year there is a Union home game at PPL park. I know they host other events at PPL, but realistically not nearly enough to compensate for the cost of the stadium)   By the way PPL park is costing the Philadelphia Union money as we speak.  Also MLS is a single entity league. Which means all the players work and get paid by MLS not the team that they play for.(This makes it different from the NFL,NBA,MLB,NHL) MLS picks up a giant portion of player salaries, especially for big name players such as Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins. Essentially Seattle is not paying their full salary.   Finally IF you look at team salaries for MLS in 2014 and run the numbers you have suggested for ticket sales, it just does not add up.   Seattle had a total team base salary of $9,633,959.  So 45,000 fans x 17 home games x Avg. $30 ticket price = 22,950,000  Philadelphia had a total team base salary of $3,921,099.  17,000 fans x 17 home games x Avg. $30 ticket price =  $8,670,000  With those numbers do you not think each team would spend more on their player salaries?  Ticket sales really have no correlation with how much any given team spends on a player. It is a common misconception among fans. Just look how much any given team actually profits from ticket sales.  http://www.thegoatparade.com/2014/4/11/5603608/comparing-2014-mls-team-spending-teams-largely-stay-in-similar-positions-year-to-year"
PhillyUnion,2uvdxw,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"I wasn't referring to a direct correlation between ticket sales and player salaries, that's silly. I don't think anyone is under the impression that ticket revenue = player salary budget. That being said, profitability at a club level probably plays a big role in how much money the MLS and individual investors are willing to invest in a team. Low ticket sales, especially considering all of the stadium costs you mentioned above, won't help the organization turn a profit, and therefore the MLS and the team owners will be less willing to invest in quality players. It's an interesting catch-22, because if they don't invest, they probably won't win back the fan base, but at the same time the answer isn't always to throw money at the problem (just look at Toronto)."

I just sent an email to the team which I am sure nobody important will even read but I hope others do something similar. Its fine if we don't have money like Toronto, Seattle or LA do but to not even be able to compete with a city like Columbus is beyond pathetic.   This offseason is such a joke that we all got excited at the thought of signing a player with zero goals and who can't get minutes for one of the worst teams in the championship. Last year they came out and said the goal was to win one of the championships (U.S. open, mls cup). Now it's to make the playoffs? All you have to do is be better than 4 teams!!

PhillyUnion,2uofhg,FlapjackJackson,16,Tue Feb 3 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"No.  No I would not.  The Union don't get to set the bar, fail to clear it, then drop the bar, fail to clear it again, then throw the bar to the ground and bunny hop over it and expect to be commended.  This team needed to take the core it had in place, improve the depth, bring in an impact striker and a left back, and have everything in place in time for training camp so there was time for things to gel.  From that core, we've already lost our CDM and LCB.  Signing a CB to replace Valdes is nice, but we still haven't replaced Okugo.  Getting an impact striker would be appreciated, but we'd still be lacking an actual left back, and our depth is still utterly dire.  And there's no chance that signings that haven't been made yet will be integrated with the team by opening day.  This offseason has been a failure.  It's just a matter of how much of a failure it is at this point."
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,TheDuckyNinja,6,Tue Feb 3 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is playing Edu at DM to replace Okugo. As it stands now, Carroll, Lahoud, and one of Bird/Simmons would be the depth there.  As for LB, Gaddis is at about the average level for an MLS LB. We could do better but so could most MLS teams."
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,TheDuckyNinja,3,Tue Feb 3 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"If Edu is moving up to DM, then we need to replace Edu at CB.  White is good depth and Marquez is unproven, I wouldn't be comfortable going in to the season with either of them as the every-game starter."
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,rabidfrodo,5,Tue Feb 3 21:24:27 2015 UTC,You forget we have Berry too. White and him are both quality CB in this league. Signing a new CB to pair with them that's a definite starter is the right move. We wrote were never going to sign a DM and CB once Edu was final.  A new striker is needed that can finish the chances that are being created.
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,leftyboy87,2,Tue Feb 3 23:32:44 2015 UTC,"White played pretty well at the end of the season, I think he's earned a better rep than ""depth"" at this point."
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,ignoramis,2,Tue Feb 3 21:38:58 2015 UTC,I would be OK with White there.
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,DrewGo,6,Tue Feb 3 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"I think people overhype the need for a left footed left back. It's a great piece to add if they've got the talent to contribute both offensively and defensively, but often times it's sacrificing one for the other. Ray Gaddis is one of the best one-on-one defenders in the league. Can he make a serious contribution offensively on the left? No. But this is going to be a defensive minded, counter attacking team. I'd rather have Gaddis's defensive ability over a good overlapping runner on the left wing."
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,TheDuckyNinja,3,Wed Feb 4 01:06:10 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Gaddis on the right, a real left back on the left, and Williams as depth at all four back positions and potentially defensive mid.  Instead, our only backup outside back is Fabinho.  That's a problem.  That's a big f'n problem."
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,thelonelyswineherd,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"It's not ideal, but Curtin seems high on Raymond Lee at LB and has indicated Lahoud could cover at RB. It remains to be seen if that's depth enough."
PhillyUnion,2uofhg,akuller,1 point,Wed Feb 4 07:47:25 2015 UTC,Williams brings so much more than Gaddis in the final third. He also is a solid right back when healthy. Last year he wasn't healthy for most of the season. Lets see what he can do when healthy for most of the year.

He only would have been here six months on loan to get playing time before returning to Europe.   This guy wasn't the answer. Sadly I haven't heard anything about any other prospective players the Union are looking at. The window for Wilk may have closed today as well.

PhillyUnion,2uf8tj,DrewGo,1 point,Mon Feb 2 14:20:40 2015 UTC,Thats a bit to much risk for me to be honest he could be great but he could be a bust depending on why he had so much success in league 2 but no play time at all in CL.

M'Bolhi//Williams-White-Gaddis//Nogueira-Edu/Wenger-Le Toux/Maidana-Pfeffer//Catic  The little used 3-6-1!  There's no way to do this in which you can feel even a little good about this roster.  Striker's a complete question mark.  There's a massive hole in the lineup that's currently filled by your choice of Berry, Marquez, Fabinho, Pfeffer, Cruz, or somebody else, none of which are particularly enticing options.  It's also a good reminder that this team's offseason has consisted of selling Okugo and probably Valdes and simply not replacing them."
PhillyUnion,2uf5o1,TheDuckyNinja,1 point,Tue Feb 3 15:20:41 2015 UTC,Did you forget we signed CJ Sapong? I'm not saying we shouldn't still be looking to sign another striker. But it's crazy to me that you'd start a 2nd round draft pick over him. Or over Casey for that matter.
PhillyUnion,2uf5o1,DrewGo,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"To me, Sapong has proven that he's not an MLS quality starting striker.  His stats are downright bad.  I know a lot of people have said that he's been playing out of position and making excuses, but he hasn't gotten the job done.  In camp so far, Catic has been the best striker.  I'd rather give him an opportunity to prove himself than give Sapong a starting spot simply because he's been in MLS longer.  As for Casey, we already know he can't go a full season starting, I'd rather use him as a late game striker."
PhillyUnion,2uf5o1,TheDuckyNinja,2,Tue Feb 3 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"His stats certainly aren't lighting the world on fire, but he's a former rookie of the year and he bagged 11 goals in all competitions in 2012.  He seems to have hit a bit of a slump these last to season, but a change of scenery seems like a good opportunity for him to shine. Catic seems promising, and I want to give him a shot too, but don't get your hopes too high on that front. He had a lot of success in NAIA, but he's unproven at higher levels of competition. Sometimes throwing a young guy into the fire isn't the right call, especially for a striker, a position where confidence is key."
PhillyUnion,2uf5o1,DrewGo,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, it's a matter of opinion.  You want to give a chance to the guy who has sucked for two straight seasons.  I want to give a chance to the guy who probably sucks but hasn't sucked yet.  The fact that we're considering starting either (or Casey or Wheeler or Hoppenot or whoever else we have) is the problem."

PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,marble617,7,Fri Jan 30 01:15:32 2015 UTC,"Letting Okugo go means we wouldn't have protected him in the expansion draft. If he wasn't going to be protected in the draft, he would have left for nothing. The trade was smart. Ribero went in the expansion draft. That is neither good nor bad but a simple reality. MacMath is not a backup GK, he deserves to be a starting GK. To keep him would be financially irreasonable (and unfair to Zac). Brown ... shrug. Curtin wasn't using him for whatever reason, so why keep paying him? Valdes is concerning ... but if he's going back to South America after the drama he dealt with on his last trip, maybe his judgement isn't what it should be. Casey is back for less money, which likely means less minutes. Which is great news, because he doesn't have a lot of gas left so we should sip rather than gulp. Fred defies logic, as does my trust in him. But we never asked much of him so I'm not sure that means much either way. Isn't less Carroll a good thing? CJ is an unknown more than anything. I've heard he wasn't being used well as much as I've heard he wasn't good enough. If he's our backup, I think we're in pretty good shape. You fail to mention Edu is officially back. He may not be a sexy big singing since we expected it to happen, but he is at least as powerful a name as Kjlestan or Mix, and let's not pretend that Villa, Gerrard, and Kaka aren't retirement leaguers. Toronto FC gets their own bullet point. Yes they just signed a resurgent Jozy and yes Giovinco is getting a lot of buzz as the greatest talent to come to MLS since Posh Spice's husband. But it's Toronto, even their fans already expect them to be wildly ineffective. There's still time for signings, even if they don't make it for camp or even Colorado. Just think, it could be worse, you could be an NY2 fan promised a signing then told it never really happened. What's going on with the CBA is basic negotiating tactics. Neither side can blink until the last minute and then things will work out as they should. I would love them to raise the cap (which would put some small DPs on regular contracts, opening room for MORE DPs), but I don't think the players or the league has the guts or the wallet for a lockout.    Any of that help?"
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,jpoRS,2,Fri Jan 30 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"Okugo that sucked but we also didn't offer him a real contract and we could have protected him over Fabi. But getting something for him is better than nothing. Ribero again he is worth more to me than Fabi. But also couldn't we have thrown a handshake wink and a nod deal with OCFC not to take our players in the expansion draft. Unfair to Zac was picking up M'bohli Brown would have been worth keeping around for league minimum I think the Union don't value Valdez at 300k Casey is good off the bench, he might be able to stay healthy if he only has to play up to 20 minutes a game. Fred will mostly be a coach I think. Casey is a good locker room presence and has a lot of experience in the MLS. I want to see as little of him on the field as possible. CJ I think will do well in Philly if we give him the chance and time. Edu has played at as high a level or higher than almost any USMNT player in the league.  He may not have played int he sexiest league in the world but he has produced in the EUEFA Champions League how many other USMNT players can boast that.  Just because his team became so debt ridden they had to fold his career was derailed temporarily when he went to stoke. Lol Toronto FC locking down spot number 6 in the east. Truth is the MLS transfer window is from now until August more or less. (yes there may be a brief period where it is closed)  Only the top players could afford a lockout or strike, sadly there are to many earning only marginally more than the league minimum."
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,akuller,1 point,Fri Jan 30 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"The Zac/M'Bolhi situation is tough. Quite a few people seem to forget just how unreliable MacMath was before M'Bolhi was announced, and after that it was too late wheels were already in motion. Is new Zac good enough to be our starting keeper? Probably. Is M'Bolhi better? Probably.  If Brown is league minimum, he's also replaceable. That's pretty much what league minimum means. ""We don't think your skills are that rare to be valuable, so you're not going to get paid competitively."" Thats' exactly my point about the lockout. Bradley and Jones etc will be fine, but there are a lot more small fish, and they will keep a lock out from happening."
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,jpoRS,3,Fri Jan 30 13:35:19 2015 UTC,Zac was starting to really come into his own prior to the M'Bohli signing.  He had been playing more consistent he just did not have a stable defenses in front of him the first half of the season. To many times he was hung out to dry. Brown was on loan from a Jamaican team and had torn up the league. He was making close to league minimum because he was only there half the season and is 22.  He hadn't had a real opportunity to prove himself outside of Jamaica. I think with the extra time to settle he could have been successful this season with his combination of pace touch and size that we saw in small doses last season.
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,akuller,0,Fri Jan 30 13:53:18 2015 UTC,"I don't follow your logic. I think if we had been able to resign him we would have protected him. I read that they offered him a new contract and he turned it down because he didn't feel like it was aggressive enough. Curtin wanted Okugo around, but the front office wasn't willing to pony up the dough to keep him.  I'm not that upset about Ribeiro, I was just commenting on the fact that losing him means losing minutes we'll need to replace. Same with Brian Brown.  I agree that Zak is a starter. I think that the loan was the best move. It's just that now, with our two other keepers being international team players we need to waste time/resources finding a backup that can fill in when they're gone. This whole GK situation has been so messed up since the beginning.  See above about Brown.  Valdes is concerning. I don't understand what the hell is going on with that guy. Everyone, Valdes included, seemed to work so hard to bring him back. Now he wants out again? What the hell man?  Casey coming back for less money is good. I was, again, just commenting on the fact that he's getting older, so we can't expect him to play as much as last season or be as productive. So we're out minutes we need to replace. Same goes for Carroll and Fred.  Edu coming back is good. I'm really glad we locked him down. He's clearly a leader on and off the field and I like him as the face of the club. You're right that I'm not giving them credit for that, and that's a fair assessment. That being said… we did have him last year. So you can't say it's an improvement as much as maintaining the status quo. As far as Villa, Gerard and Kaka go… Retirement or not, they're damn good players and they'll raise the level of play in this league.  Toronto, ugh… I would have agreed with you about their ineffectiveness until today. Them bringing in Benoit Cheyrou was a really damn good move. It seems clear that the mistake they made of focusing only on marquee signings last season won't happen again. They're building a team around Bradley, Giovinco and Altidore. And if they give those guys some mid level talent to work with… we all need to watch out.  There is still time, and Curtin has asked us to judge the roster in March, which is fair. But I AM nervous about the signings not being there for camp. Guy's need time to gel, especially at CB, which I think is a huge part of why we got off to a bad start last season. The Berry Okugo CB pairing never got a chance to work out and then the dreaded Aaron Wheeler experiment happened. If we plan to bring in a CB (which Curtin said was something they were in the market for), he needs time to gel with White/Berry/Edu/whoever.  I get that the CBA is a lot of posturing, but there are little details that make me really nervous. I keep reading that the players are unwilling to compromise on free agency and that the owners won't even bring it up. I dunno, I'm probably least concerned about this because you're absolutely right that there's a lot of money to be lost by a work stoppage, so I think someone will blink.    Honestly, yes. Even if I'm super argumentative. It makes me feel better to talk about it and rant. Get's it out of my system, ya know?"
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,marksills,0,Fri Jan 30 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"Letting Okugo go means we wouldn't have protected him in the expansion draft. If he wasn't going to be protected in the draft, he would have left for nothing. The trade was smart.   Would've been smarter to offer him a good contract and protect him"
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,spqr-king,7,Fri Jan 30 04:59:26 2015 UTC,I am only worried because at this point i'm not even hearing rumors and that terrifies me.
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,DoubleHappyDave,10,Fri Jan 30 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"I think Sapong is better than Casey last year.  Casey off the bench is better than anything we had off the bench last year.  Edu can replace Okugo with Berry and White behind him.  Especially if they can gel and play most of the year together.  We have lost ground to other teams who are making moves, but we are no worse so far than last year.  A DP Striker or solid LB would do wonders though."
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,magnumbbrown,2,Thu Jan 29 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"I don't love the idea of a White/Berry CB pairing, but I don't completely hate it. White impressed last year and I think Berry just had a run of really bad luck with injuries and illnesses. I'd rather see Edu stay at CB with one of them and see the team bring in a CDM. I've heard rumors about this Wilk character, but I don't know anything about him.   I agree that a Striker and LB would be just wonderful.   Edu may be able to replace Okugo on the field, but no one can replace Okugo in my heart :'-("
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,akuller,4,Thu Jan 29 21:36:40 2015 UTC,"For me I hate losing Okugo...I know it's hyperbole to say it, but he was our Brian Dawkins in the sense that he was good, there from the start, and a fan favorite. Plus he was a great dude. I need to see some commitment from the front office, it seems like we a set on being reactive and not proactive. I keep hearing that the CBA and/or Valdes is holding up our transfer business. This is unacceptable do we not have a reserve of funds? TFC is embarrassing everyone with their signings again this offseason and even Orlando effing City is making it rain like a lil wayne video. I'm so sick of teams that came in around the same time as us (Portland, Seattle) and teams that came in after us (Montreal, Orlando, nycfc) seemingly taking things seriously (I know the Lampard thing seems unfair but did anyone honestly expect him here before th summer?) I like Curtin and I Like Albright. I believe they want to win but there has to be more proactiveness in that front office. Also Sack Sak"
PhillyUnion,2u4f4w,drewuke,2,Thu Jan 29 22:28:36 2015 UTC,Loosing Okugo really sucks I think he was a fan favorite and probably one of my favorite players on the team In the case of Seattle and Portland both teams already existed prior to their joining the MLS. They both had decent rosters Seattle I belive had Seba prior to joining the MLS. Montreal and Orlando also existed prior to there entrance to the MLS and seem to have backers with some financial weight. (not that Seattle dosent)  The entire Valdez thing is greatly held up because of MLS's single entity structure. Basically we own his rights in the league and pay his salary and what not but the MLS holds his contract and is part of the sale which cause many complication. I have also heard rumors he could be involved in a player swap. I think Curtin and Albright have said the right things but I agree we need to see some action but I would rather them be cautious and find the right player than bring in another Porfino Lopez. We do not want to see a roster spot wasted in that way again.

I agree with /u/phancypheetz, I do intend to go to games this season, but they have a point.  Unfortunately, all the singing in the world won't do anything to the front office, the ones calling the major shots with budgets and what not speak one language: $$$.   Nick himself has stated ""the hardcore fan is not our target demographic"".  If they can get people in seats and turn a profit they will with spending the least amount possible.  One of the only reasons the front office is feeling the pressure is because of the amount of people who have not renewed their season tickets due to this crap offseason.   Sadly, that's the reality of the situation because while the players, coaches, etc care about winning, and the front office does to an extent, the FO cares much more about profits than anything else.

PhillyUnion,2tz97m,Mountainhawk98,4,Wed Jan 28 17:15:08 2015 UTC,And then moved to striker
PhillyUnion,2tz97m,marble617,3,Wed Jan 28 22:37:13 2015 UTC,I mean just the fact that he put the ball in the back of the net makes me happy haha even if it is practice that's all we really need
PhillyUnion,2tz97m,a_lintner7,5,Fri Jan 30 18:04:05 2015 UTC,Dzenan Catic in training today.
PhillyUnion,2tz97m,kbm903,2,Wed Jan 28 17:02:03 2015 UTC,I was expecting something mildly impressive. Instead I saw the touch that most high school players possess.

PhillyUnion,2tz97m,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:12:41 2015 UTC,I know it's a drill with no defenders but he seems to have decent touch on the ball which has been my greatest critique of other guys on the team.
PhillyUnion,2tz97m,TaeKurmulti,3,Wed Jan 28 17:51:12 2015 UTC,"Eh gotta wait to see it when the games on, I imagine every professional player has that touch in training.  I'd say half the posters on here could do that."

PhillyUnion,2tz97m,zgreen05,2,Wed Jan 28 17:52:23 2015 UTC,it was a pretty basic first touch IMO. wait to judge until he has actual pressure on him.
PhillyUnion,2tzo18,TJunior1014,3,Wed Jan 28 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"The comments on the article were actually the opposite of what I expected.  I would love if we were a big-money team, but I do feel better knowing Curtin and Albright understand our limitations and how to (hopefully) work around them."
PhillyUnion,2tzo18,--smokeandmirrors--,2,Wed Jan 28 21:55:29 2015 UTC,I don't wanna fall victim to hype and false hopes but these guys are definitely making me feel slightly better about the future of the team. They seem to get philly sports. Hopefully they can produce good results.
PhillyUnion,2tzo18,drayb3,2,Wed Jan 28 22:44:42 2015 UTC,They're Philly guys. They get it. I'm not going to judge Curtin until after he has a full season under his belt.
PhillyUnion,2tzo18,emptythecache,2,Thu Jan 29 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'm such a big fan of the way Curtin talks to the press. He hasn't said anything that has ever said to me he's full of shit.

PhillyUnion,2tvq8x,spqr-king,5,Tue Jan 27 20:42:40 2015 UTC,Of course they'll sign some more players. Will they be people we immediately get excited about? That's hard to say.

PhillyUnion,2tvq8x,midwesternhousewives,2,Tue Jan 27 22:14:32 2015 UTC,Does the window close in February? I'm not 100% on MLS transfer rules
PhillyUnion,2tvq8x,marble617,2,Tue Jan 27 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"Strangely, each country has its own transfer window policy for its leagues.  Most of the European windows close between Jan 31 and Feb 2.  Most of the Western Hemisphere windows are open until the end of March.  So the window closes awhile from now, but if we're working on bringing over players from Europe, it's gotta be in the next few days."
PhillyUnion,2tvq8x,TheDuckyNinja,1 point,Wed Jan 28 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"So does that mean players can only come into those countries during the window, but they can be sold whenever?"
PhillyUnion,2tvq8x,marble617,2,Wed Jan 28 04:27:04 2015 UTC,"No, players can only be transferred in or out when the window is open.  Once the window is closed, the only player movement allowed is releasing a player, signing a player who was a FA at the time the previous transfer window closed, and getting an emergency exception to sign a player (pretty much only happens when a team has multiple GK injuries; the MLS deals with this with the league GK pool)."
PhillyUnion,2tvq8x,TheDuckyNinja,2,Wed Jan 28 14:21:51 2015 UTC,"I fully expect to hear Curtin and Albright saying ""just be patient"", ""signings are coming"", and ""it takes a little time to hammer out the details"" in April with still no signings."

I have been relentlessly checking our reddit page and Twitter hoping to hear some news. I really want to trust Albright and Curtin but it sucks hearing what everyone else is doing in our conference knowing we need to get on the ball.
PhillyUnion,2tvq8x,magnumbbrown,1 point,Wed Jan 28 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"I think there's signings coming, but no big OMGWOW. Then again, last year we (and I think most of the Union fan base) had relatively little idea who Maidana and Noguera were before they arrived here and both impressed (well, Noguera did...Maidana my verdict is still out on). I'm expecting something in this vein still."
PhillyUnion,2tw0ii,Pany215,5,Tue Jan 27 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"I expect McCarthy, Catic, and Bird to make the team.  I'd be surprised if more than one of the other guys made the team."

I don't think they will be on the first team but I think it is a good learning experience.  McCarthy (GK) is solid. He's a local boy too and did work in the USL last year. Dzenan (F) will be a good striker, definitely not a starter but I see him getting some minutes. Same with Eric Bird (M) only because I want to chant BIRD IS THE WORD!"

PhillyUnion,2trjr2,akuller,3,Mon Jan 26 22:46:44 2015 UTC,We also have White who played well but needs more playing and Berry who was injured so we never really got to see if he was any good.

PhillyUnion,2trmjp,akuller,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:42:37 2015 UTC,I don't think he would leave his current club. But it would be an option worth exploring at the right price.
PhillyUnion,2trmjp,akuller,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"Good point, I do not know where he currently stands with 1860 Munich but about 7-10 days ago he was looking for an early exit due to lack of playing time.  http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/66/united-states/2015/01/19/8124482/american-forward-bobby-wood-seeking-exit-from-1860-munich"
PhillyUnion,2trmjp,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue Jan 27 19:13:23 2015 UTC,I have found 3 articles on him being out of favor with 1860 Munich but two were from mlssoccer.com.  I feel he would most likely look for a move in Europe if possible.  Maybe we could get him on a loan but I think his goal is to get playing time for a European club.
PhillyUnion,2trmjp,akuller,3,Tue Jan 27 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"He did an interview on ExtraTime Radio last week.  He's definitely done at 1860,  he said the new head coach who used to be the assistant has always disliked him, and Wood basically said he doesn't know how the guy has a job.    Wood also said that for whatever reason 1860 is asking for waaaay too much money for his transfer, sounds like a personal thing with the coach to me.  Wood said he would definitely go to MLS, but really it sounds like he wants to go anywhere to anyone willing to pay his crazy transfer fee because he's not going to see anytime with 1860 at all.   So if the Union were to make the offer, I don't see why he wouldn't play here or MLS in general.  But I don't see the Union way over paying for a guy who really has not accomplished anything yet. I don't see the Union way overpaying for anyone lol."
PhillyUnion,2tr4d3,garretthav,6,Mon Jan 26 19:40:49 2015 UTC,Good this happened every time the window was open. He was good but if you don't want to be here get out. We have the good CB's anyway.
PhillyUnion,2tr4d3,rabidfrodo,3,Mon Jan 26 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"Disappointing but hopefully this is just the first domino waiting to fall, free up space for the new signings.  Maybe."
PhillyUnion,2tr4d3,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Mon Jan 26 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"Space? I'd say it means more money to spend, but knowing the Union we probably sold him for a bag of balls and a coupon book."

PhillyUnion,2tr4d3,dekelly,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"Not too disappointed. Carlos didn't really make an impression when he came back, but he has a World Cup pedigree and a lot of experience, so we could stand to make something significant via trade. If the rumors about Wilk are true, it means Edu can move to the backline as well. The only issue is depth. IMO White starts next to Edu. His distribution was poor but he looks to have a lot of upside, and he has very good defensive instincts to build off of. Berry should be the go-to-guy but he's been on the bench/injured so much, who knows at this point."

I agree with the philosophy that we don't need big names to win games, but we're still going to have to spend SOME money if we want to have a good squad. We don't need to drop 10 million on anybody, but I don't think Moneyball works as well in Soccer as Jay Sugarman hopes."

We have a solid team and a few more pieces could put us in the playoffs. I just hope the team performs and the pieces fall into place for his sake because he seems like a stand up guy.
PhillyUnion,2tfa34,Guidosama,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember what he's saying about Edu. The guy is a fantastic player in two positions so after we get a striker we can get either a holding midfielder or a center back and Edu can play whichever role we need. We still have one of the best central midfielders in MLS in Nogueira and I think he'll get even better this year. I think Maidana will improve too, but we'll have to wait and see. I'd be disappointed if we didn't move for Gilberto at Toronto. I think he'd be a great addition up top."

PhillyUnion,2tg7s8,jd158ug,-1,Fri Jan 23 22:24:41 2015 UTC,A way for the cheap-ass FO to get a staff member paid by the cap. Just like Albright's last year 'playing'.
PhillyUnion,2tg7s8,yung_swagged_out_mf,3,Sat Jan 24 04:17:27 2015 UTC,as long as they aren't taking up as much of the cap as last year I don't really mind this.  we have a lot of promising young guys and draft picks that could benefit from their experience.

I'd rather take a chance on academy players or bringing up players from our affiliates. Personally I wouldn't want our young guys learning from Carroll. Just my opinion."
PhillyUnion,2tg7s8,spqr-king,9,Fri Jan 23 23:54:31 2015 UTC,Honestly we needed to sign Casey. If players are that dedicated to the team rewarding them will pay dividends in the future as young players see how we treat our vets out on the field and off the field they will be drawn to this attitude of mutual respect. Just my opinion.
PhillyUnion,2tg7s8,akuller,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:53:01 2015 UTC,carroll was not a bad player he has just has played well past his prime. He is a good locker room guy and we should move him to a similar role to fred as a player coach.

However, this means we don't really have any new ideas (signings) in mind; we're okay with re-signing players that we were willing to let go a few months ago because there's no one better to take their place (as previously thought).   Same as it ever was."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,LocksTheFox,6,Wed Jan 21 16:44:46 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about him other than he's quite a handsome man.
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,emptythecache,4,Wed Jan 21 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't know how to feel about this, do we really need to add to the DMF list before adding a striker/goalkeeper? Anyone know anything on this guy?"
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,cuzigothye,7,Wed Jan 21 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"i don't know anything about him but to answer your question...YES DESPERATELY. If edu is playing CB we have an enormous gapping hole at CDM that is not just a need but a must have to compete in this league. In striker we have a Sapong, Catic, and Casey, with Hoppenot to fill in small gaps. In GK, we have Rais and Blake but could always promote an academy player or grab a veteran with 2 years left in him for real cheap. CDM is the most crucial need we have at the moment. GK/ST come next, then a LB."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,MrChips217,5,Wed Jan 21 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree. If we have Berry and White, we could always move Mo to CDM (where he would rather play) and link with Nogs to start an attack. Our need is a goal scorer. It has always been a goal scorer and until we sign one it will always be a goal scorer"
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,in_the_against,3,Wed Jan 21 18:21:05 2015 UTC,"Curtin says he wants to play Edu as a CB. Also, this guy is likely a far better player than Berry."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,FlapjackJackson,3,Wed Jan 21 18:47:27 2015 UTC,"Does not matter if he is better than Berry. I'm sure he is. Just like Rais is our best keeper, but our need was greater at forward than it was at GK.   It's about allocation of resources rather than best player available.  That said I am not against the move, just do not feel confident with out striker corp yet."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,in_the_against,4,Wed Jan 21 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"It's also about putting out the best Starting XI out there. Edu is better for us at CB than DM. We need a true stay at home DM, not someone who tracks forward and gets caught out of position."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,FlapjackJackson,2,Wed Jan 21 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"I would like to see another ST signing as much of the next guy but with the Sapong move and the Okugo departure that position, yet again, bumped down in priority . We have literally no depth in that position. We need a CDM. case closed. Then we focus on a ST, then a GK, then maybe a LB."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,MrChips217,3,Thu Jan 22 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"It's probably in Mo's best interests to play CB though, if he wants another shot at the USMNT."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,funkyquasar,3,Wed Jan 21 20:53:43 2015 UTC,"There was a statistical breakdown of centerback pairings last year someone posted on here or PSP.  The long and short  of it was, it didn't matter who was at CB, as long as one of the two was Mo."
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,arkr,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:54:25 2015 UTC,But the goal scoring also dropped when Mo was at CB and that wasn't mentioned I don't think
PhillyUnion,2t6o0x,beggarb,3,Thu Jan 22 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think I recall reading that too. But IIRC the scoring dropped like .3 GPG, whereas the letting in went down 1GPG. So it still worked statistically.   If we got a solid DM (this polish fella seems like a good choice) and then a better striker, I don't feel goals will be an issue. Curtin has said numerous times we are going to be a defensive team. I'm okay with that as long as he commits to it."

PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,Thetruegame,4,Wed Jan 21 03:29:59 2015 UTC,Didnt Curtin say wait until March to judge? Im hoping we hit up a striker like Klose or Gilberto who Toronto would presumably have to get rid of among others both of them might be available at non DP salaries as well since their age and lack of goal scoring last season which is what we seem to be looking for cheap but solid pickups.
PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,spqr-king,4,Wed Jan 21 03:50:21 2015 UTC,"Think Berry and Garber Bucks/picks gets a Gilberto deal done? TFC needs defenders, we need a striker, why not trade from strengths to fill weaknesses? We have Valdes, Edu, and White who can play CB, but we're in dire need of a striker, which they do have a handful of (Jozy, Dike, Moore, Oduro)"
PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,LocksTheFox,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:08:27 2015 UTC,I can see that happening out of the three I would rather White go honestly but Valdes is a more likely choice in that deal I think.

PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,spqr-king,1 point,Wed Jan 21 13:32:52 2015 UTC,I think white may be better than berry. also why do we want a guy who didn't produce last year and is old for young talent?
PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,akuller,1 point,Wed Jan 21 13:36:24 2015 UTC,He has potential and is not even old hes two years outside of the prime age for strikers if im not mistaken he is only 25?
PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,spqr-king,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:50:15 2015 UTC,fair enough but we would have to get him on the real cheap to make it worth while. we already have a project striker that could take those minutes he played for Toronto.
PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,akuller,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:01:05 2015 UTC,Thats what im saying we could potentially get him at a decent price with him falling out of favor and dropping from DP pricing but I doubt it will happen.

PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,ignoramis,1 point,Wed Jan 21 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"Haha that is good to see. For some reason I thought I read somewhere that he was just over the PD threshold and that if the current rules did not change during the collective bargaining agreement, he would have to end up being a DP. I could be totally off on that though. I feel as if I read so many different things this offseason idk what is true and what is not."
PhillyUnion,2t4qjk,spqr-king,1 point,Wed Jan 21 12:56:05 2015 UTC,Well if Toronto has their way they will up the DP limit for Gilberto. I think if we signed a keeper as a DP before a striker people would have shit a chicken lol

PhillyUnion,2t2juo,rnc487,5,Tue Jan 20 20:49:40 2015 UTC,Can we ban Carlos Valdes rumors please? He's been linked to every South American team at least twice now. I'm not believing anything but official statements from the Union.
PhillyUnion,2t2juo,Dean_Moriarty,7,Tue Jan 20 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"This post actually inspired me to figure out how to do link flair just so I could mark it as ""Rumor""."

PhillyUnion,2t2juo,Dean_Moriarty,6,Tue Jan 20 19:36:39 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this isn't true.  I'm tired of these loans, either sell him so we can move on or keep here with the team."
PhillyUnion,2t2juo,goatyhead,3,Tue Jan 20 18:33:45 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. The last thing this team is any more questions about who plays CB.
PhillyUnion,2t2juo,rabidfrodo,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:55:30 2015 UTC,Sell him already. I was over him the moment his return from loan became a debacle.
PhillyUnion,2t2juo,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"If this is true, it's clear he doesn't want to play here and wants to go back home in South America.  If that's the case, let him go and sell him.  I'm sick of these loans maaaan."

PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,dzfooty,5,Mon Jan 19 23:28:53 2015 UTC,"I actually get along okay  with them because I do defend Rais. Which is surprising, given that I'm a lesbian trans woman, and would therefore be in jail if I actually lived over there."
PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,FlapjackJackson,3,Mon Jan 19 23:38:28 2015 UTC,Jail if your lucky... He seems like a great player and he seems to like it here because of that freedom your talking about.
PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,dzfooty,7,Mon Jan 19 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"Good point. And yeah, I assume you saw that interview. He said he loved Philly and the USA because he was able to worship how he wanted to worship and there is a big, welcoming Muslim community in Philly, as opposed to Bulgaria, Russia, and Greece, where people would judge him just for being African.  As much shit as I give this country sometimes (most of the time, even)...I'm lucky it's much more open to people like me than many other places in the world."
PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,FlapjackJackson,2,Mon Jan 19 23:50:34 2015 UTC,Hey you do you thats the motto or at least it should be. I do like that the fan base didnt like him at first for legitimate reasons but never because of his faith or ethnicity but his skills as a player during the matches we watched.
PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,dzfooty,5,Tue Jan 20 00:02:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly the more I look at him on and off the pitch the more I like him. I think it's kinda unfair to judge a midseason add on four matches, I'm reserving judgment on him for when he gets more time. Especially at a position like keeper where familiarity and communication with the back line is crucial. Otherwise, you get shit like the Newcastle goal against Saints this weekend, where there's no communication between the defender and the keeper and it results in a garbage goal.  If he plays like he's capable of, like today, he can be an elite MLS goalkeeper and possible All-Star (even with MLS having a TON of quality keepers). Once he gets back from this tournament, the preseason will be key for him to establish familiarity with his back four."

PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Tue Jan 20 20:19:54 2015 UTC,I think you'd be fine in some parts of Algiers (that's the only city I truly know). There is a queer collective that I hang out with over there whenever I visit. We haven't had any trouble. ;) You can get away with a lot but it's risky.   Over there there are lots of things that are 'frowned-upon' even if it's an unmarried couple showing affection in public.
PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,dzfooty,2,Tue Jan 20 00:12:59 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. Cheers!   I'm a person who adores travel and culture, so I'll make a note of that =P"

PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,funkyquasar,2,Tue Jan 20 00:24:02 2015 UTC,Indonesia is actually interesting from an LGBTQ perspective since they recognize multiple genders there.
PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,spqr-king,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"They also do in India and the two Samoas, probably some other nations too. In fact an American Samoan footballer who played the 31-0 loss to Australia in a WC qualifier was a fa'afafine (which is what they call their third gender)"
PhillyUnion,2sz3gg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:47:24 2015 UTC,Pakistan is a bit similar. It doesn't necessarily recognize 'multiple genders' but lots of trans-men and women are out in the open and some of them are in the media or work government jobs.

PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,TheDuckyNinja,6,Mon Jan 19 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"I believe that we'll make moves, and not to panic yet. Curtin asked fans not to judge the lineup until March, which leads me to believe they've got something up their sleeves. They're very aware of the deficiencies up top and I'd be very surprised if we didn't get a better striker.  I'm worried like everyone else, but I'm not going to panic yet, they pulled the same thing with our midfield last year."
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:06:34 2015 UTC,I feel like they have something up their sleeves too i just don't think it is going to be enough to make us a true contender this year.
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,Dpw22393,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"they pulled the same thing with our midfield last year   And see where it got us. Late roster moves really screw a team. Last year everyone said ""of course we struggled early. Our team didn't gel in preseason"". Preseason as it stands is barely adequate to mesh a squad. I'm not willing to sacrifice points in the first two months of the season because the FO sat on its hands now.   Why should we wait until march (when most international transfer windows are closed by the by) to improve our team? Do it now!"
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,Mike81890,2,Mon Jan 19 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"The MLS transfer window doesn't open until February. If we sign someone now, he still has to wait until February to join the team."
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,FlapjackJackson,7,Tue Jan 20 00:37:03 2015 UTC,"Dude, you need to calm down and take a deep breath.   Casey is most likely coming back. He's been quoted as saying as much. If he wasn't he wouldn't have pulled out of the re-entry draft. He doesn't really count as a signing. A striker core of Sapong, Casey, and Catic is serviceable. Sapong should see some real improvement compared to last year. Casey is decent in spurts. Catic is a wildcard, but he looks pretty legit but young. It won't light the MLS on fire, but it's not terrible either. Contrary to popular opinion, we can survive with Ray at LB. Just about every team needs a LB in MLS, and there are very few real stars at the position in the league. We are just like every other team.   Honestly, a DM is the only pressing need. We can make the playoffs in a very weak Eastern Conference with this team if we add a DM. Any additional signings will just boost our finish up the table.  Seriously, just look at the other teams in this conference.    The Red Bulls are a dumpster fire.  The Crew lack a true striker.  The Fire and NYC have absolutely no one in defense.  Toronto is Toronto, and Montreal is Montreal.  D.C., New England, and Orlando are the only sure fire teams in this conference.  In the case of Orlando, they have to go up against the fact that expansion teams are historically bad.   Things really aren't bad. Take a deep breath and have faith."
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:53:54 2015 UTC,"NYC has George John who's pretty damn good. Although that's banking on him being healthy, which hasn't happened in a while."

Either John McCarthy- USL PRO GK and rookie of the year. Local ties to Reading and La Salle. Or Nick Noble- who played for Harrisburg and had a decent season.
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,Thetruegame,2,Tue Jan 20 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"This week is it. If after this week there's still nothing, I think that's the point where we can be truly concerned."
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,funkyquasar,3,Mon Jan 19 16:22:47 2015 UTC,I would wait until the end of the winter transfer window.  Also we can sign players out of contract at end of season at any point.  And can make moves with teams inside the league outside the transfer window.
PhillyUnion,2sxx2l,akuller,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:28:24 2015 UTC,True. But I'm cautious about signings missing too much of preseason.

Apparently Curtin imparted information to some people the other night, but swore them to super secrecy. But those super-speshul snowflakes believe the guy is on the up and up.

He seems like a stand up guy, this is just a VERY secretive club.   However, there are still some encouraging rumors out there. I saw Curtin say in an interview that they had offers out to two ""top players."" The rumor mill seems to be saying the offers are out to an LB and a ST. We're also apparently still in the running for Sacha Kljestan, though I don't see us outbidding L.A. There's also the Kvist rumor. Everything suggests they're aware of all the needs that the fanbase is talking about. We just need to wait it out, as painful as it is.   But man I am with you. By this time last year we had at least heard rumors about Edu, Maidana and Nogueira. I'd love to know who the LB and the ST are we've sent offers to."
PhillyUnion,2sxx39,Pany215,3,Mon Jan 19 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"He won't be the best backup in the league, but he'll be cheap, and Blake will get playing time. A true LB would be real nice though."
PhillyUnion,2sxx39,funkyquasar,3,Mon Jan 19 16:21:01 2015 UTC,Unless my count is off I think we'll only need the backup for 4 starts so he doesn't need to be spectacular. As long as our defense holds up.

What I would be interested in also is getting people together for away games. Either heading up to NY or DC, or meeting at a bar to watch a game (assuming they show it on tv somewhere)"
PhillyUnion,2snfd9,southphillyscum,3,Fri Jan 16 20:00:56 2015 UTC,That actually sounds pretty epic might have to travel up if you guys can pick a match that fits!
PhillyUnion,2snfd9,spqr-king,3,Sat Jan 17 00:01:23 2015 UTC,What would people want for a game?  I was thinking June 6th against NYCFC would be a good one.
PhillyUnion,2snfd9,spqr-king,2,Sat Jan 17 03:47:33 2015 UTC,That would be an awesome match I honestly doubt ill be able to go as I just got tickets to the Seattle match and im traveling from 9 hours away (military) to watch that match and maybe Montreal if I can find cheap tickets. Best of luck though if I still lived back home it would be easier.
PhillyUnion,2snfd9,B4kstabr,3,Sat Jan 17 04:37:05 2015 UTC,Id be into going to a game if we got a group.  Hell 50 people might be pushing it but who knows?  Delawarean here super simple for me to get up there.

PhillyUnion,2snfd9,SlamFist,2,Fri Jan 16 20:34:15 2015 UTC,Yes
PhillyUnion,2snfd9,chrisronald67,2,Sat Jan 17 16:59:44 2015 UTC,Good idea.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,TJunior1014,9,Fri Jan 16 13:57:59 2015 UTC,I think adequate public transportation options would solve a lot of problems. If they made it as easy as hopping on a light rail line it'd be fantastic.   I don't really like the idea of having all of the sports buildings in the same place.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,goatyhead,5,Fri Jan 16 15:47:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. Use the train tracks right next to the stadium and link it to a SEPTA Line. Problem solved.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,FlapjackJackson,3,Fri Jan 16 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"Link it to a rail line that runs with frequency and regularity.     FTFY.  The advantage of the Broad Street Line is that runs every ten minutes with added express trains on game days.  You don't have to rush out of the stadium rushing for a train knowing that if you miss it, you've got a decent wait for the next one."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,MoonlightRider,2,Fri Jan 16 16:53:02 2015 UTC,"Ha... ""Added express trains""  Game days were the bane of my week when I lived in South Philly.  The didn't add extra trains, they just ran the regular schedule (which is already stingy) and made every third train or so an express. I frequently waited 25-30 minutes for the subway on my way home from Center City on game days.  So infuriating.  Sorry that had nothing to do with your comment specifically, just remembering what an awful time it was and it always seemed to be when I already had a headache."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,cmdaniels,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:41:45 2015 UTC,I know that feel
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,southphillyscum,2,Fri Jan 16 20:02:36 2015 UTC,That would be amazing. The lack of SEPTA access to the stadium is a real inconvenience.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,jdubs222,1 point,Fri Jan 16 16:46:19 2015 UTC,The only thing is Septa won't make a transit line that only gets used during the season on game days.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,M_Me_Meteo,5,Fri Jan 16 17:26:53 2015 UTC,It would make sense to pair it with the eventual development of Chester that was part of the Union's stadium approval . . . if that development ever happens.  The transit could also be used for Chester folks to commute to Philly.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,FlapjackJackson,4,Fri Jan 16 17:38:12 2015 UTC,Any chance they could contract with the Duck Boats for Water Public Transportation on the Delaware?
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,DeepestTruthFC,3,Fri Jan 16 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"Now that's thinking outside the box. I figure it'd be destined for a passenger mutiny though, enough (pre-game) drinking would almost certainly end with piracy."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,goatyhead,2,Fri Jan 16 20:56:15 2015 UTC,GOAT idea
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,southphillyscum,6,Fri Jan 16 21:00:46 2015 UTC,The one negative for me is the stadium location with the Union. I've not been to a game yet. If PPL Park was magically relocated to be near the other stadiums here I'd have season tickets and attend every game.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,Games_and_Dames,4,Fri Jan 16 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Same here. I don't have a car and it's just too damn difficult / expensive to get down to PPL. I missed the first shuttle back to the train station last time, caught the second one, train waited for the third one. Took damn near 90 minutes to get back to center city after the match.  Maybe making a better way to get from center city to Chester would help with the situation. A free shuttle directly from Pattison maybe?"
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,leclair929,2,Fri Jan 16 15:24:42 2015 UTC,What is stopping you from getting to PPL?
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,goatyhead,3,Fri Jan 16 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"For me, I live in South Jersey, just outside Philadelphia. It can be 45 minutes to an hour to get to PPL and my only option is to drive.  It's 25 minutes further than the South Philly stadiums for me.    In addition, there is no easy public transit out to the park.  This is in contrast to the quick PATCO ride (running every 15-20 minutes) and connection to the Broad Street Subway (which operates Express trains to/from the stadiums on game days).   The stadium is beautiful but getting there can really be an excursion."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,MoonlightRider,1 point,Fri Jan 16 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat, just from the opposite direction, I think my average drive time is around 90 minutes.  Not saying that in any kind of competitive way, just adding a data point. I'm going to assume that making my way through Chester county is a lot easier than what you deal with traffic-wise.  I don't think there is any way for me to make a public transportation route work. I guess I could drive out to Downingtown or Thorndale and jump on a train. But I won't even consider that unless I can be dropped at PPL and be certain I'll get home without much trouble."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,goatyhead,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"In addition, there is no easy public transit out to the park. This is in contrast to the quick PATCO ride (running every 15-20 minutes) and connection to the Broad Street Subway (which operates Express trains to/from the stadiums on game days).   The only other option is the Atlantic City line to 30th Street Station to the Septa Wilmington/Newark line, but that assumes you live close enough to a stop (Lindenwald, Cherry Hill, Pennsauken) but that seems like a pain in the ass all things considered. Patco to the Broad streetline seems infinitely easier and with more frequent trains"

PhillyUnion,2smm4j,M_Me_Meteo,2,Fri Jan 16 17:25:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, I understand not going regularly because of the location, but not going once is on you.  I'm from NEPA and I've driven 2+ hours for a game a few times."

PhillyUnion,2smm4j,xxtoejamfootballxx,4,Fri Jan 16 21:48:07 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that I think the current location is absolutely incredible, despite being in Chester (River, bridge, open space for tailgating, etc.).   That being said, I think Center City would be completely out of the question, there could be potential to put it over near University City but that would require demolition of something. The most ideal location would indeed be near the other stadiums, a potential location would be where the casino will be."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,oestre24,4,Fri Jan 16 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"If I became a multi-billionaire and money was no object, I always though an old city/penn's landing location would be amazing.    The Ben Franklin could replace the commodore barry, plus you get skyline bonus.  Easily accessible by public transit.  Driving would be a pain. Would probably have to build on on/off ramp from 95 and some parking garages and such but hopefully with more people taking public transit there would be less congestion of cars.  You could hit up a bar before and after the game and walk. And being in the heart of the city would allow the team greater exposure and more fans."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,Dean_Moriarty,4,Fri Jan 16 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"There is so much vacant waterfront space in this city, especially around Port Richmond, that it could go somewhere on the riverfront within the city proper. I'd love to see it go where the old Reading Railroad had their piers north of the Delaware Generating Station.   The only issue might be access: is the exit at Girard and Aramingo/Richmond St able to handle the additional traffic, and would transit users mind a jump from the BSL to the 15 trolley?   Otherwise there's still space north of there even. Put it up near Holmesburg maybe."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,EdBacon,2,Fri Jan 16 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"This is the area that first came to mind for me as well. I live in Northern Liberties and it's only about a 10 min walk to get to Yards Brewery. It would be awesome if the stadium was in that general area along the river. At the same time, I grew up just ten minutes away from the Comm Barry Bridge on the Jersey side, so where it's located now feels like home and it's where most of my family is still located so I'm cool with its current placement."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,thelostdolphin,3,Fri Jan 16 22:49:21 2015 UTC,Near Yards Brewery? God what a spot that could be. I was bored and did some quicky measuring.  http://i.imgur.com/FahnA0h.png  http://i.imgur.com/TyFbaqn.jpg  Obviously you would need to reclaim some land from the water but imagine this spot. The 1000 foot marker from 95 to the spot is where the Spring Garden street stop is.. And going by some rough measurements a stadium the size of PPL fits comfortably in the outlining rectangle with room to spare...  For funsies using googles neat perspective thingy  http://i.imgur.com/KqPVhPL.jpg
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Sat Jan 17 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the exact spot I've wished it was: Festival Pier. Would still have a cool view of a bridge from there...Ben Franklin Bridge, in this case!"
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,tiwahu,1 point,Sat Jan 17 04:33:49 2015 UTC,That's really cool and literally exactly the space I was thinking of.   Nice job!
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,thelostdolphin,3,Sat Jan 17 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"The stadium location is the only major issue I have with the franchise.  I am 29 years old now, so I will likely live to see the Union's second stadium and I am hoping that one will be located within the city limits.  I can be hopeful that the league will grow to the point where the Union maybe play 1 or 2 marquee games during the season at The Linc similar to what the Earthquakes do with California Clasico or the Sounders do with opening the top level of their stadium.  I don't think it's unrealistic for a yearly game against NYCFC to be big enough to demand that be played every year on a Saturday afternoon at The Linc.  But, to answer your question, my ideal scenario would be the Union's new stadium being opened up somewhere on the waterfront.  Not only would that be such a great location for a stadium, but it would speed up the development of those several miles of highly valuable land (in my opinion, one of the biggest problems with Philly's city planning), so it would also be a big win for the city."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,JoeBenzon,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"I really do love PPL park but I hate Chester. South Philly near the stadiums would be cool, but I would honestly be happy if the stadium was in West or North East Philadelphia, or just anywhere with good access to the subway.  In the mean time I'm fine with PPL but a move into the city would really help raise the profile of the team and help build our fanbase more."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,southphillyscum,1 point,Fri Jan 16 15:27:41 2015 UTC,It would be fantastic if the stadium was in sports complex by the rest of the Philly stadiums.   It also would have been interesting to see what would have happened if the original plan for having it in Glassboro right off Rt. 55. IIRC there was also supposed to be a train line (PATCO?) built for easy access.

PhillyUnion,2smm4j,ignoramis,1 point,Sat Jan 17 04:01:59 2015 UTC,it would have to be in west or north philly and although I don't have a problem with that I imagine a lot of other people would.
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:47:24 2015 UTC,"I actually like the location. I think it's much more preferable to having a stadium in Philly. Getting into and out wherever the stadium would be in the city (yet alone parking) would be a pain in the ass. If it were up to me, I'd further embrace the uniqueness and variety of our supporters and change the name to Delaware Valley Union."
PhillyUnion,2smm4j,4-1-3-2,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:14:54 2015 UTC,Honestly it could happen with the growth of MLS and given time (a lot of time...) That being said its current location makes it pretty accessible can you imagine the congestion on gameday in the city? I sure can after multiple trips to Wizards games in DC and such having a stadium in the city can be a pain in the ass.

PhillyUnion,2sjtor,LocksTheFox,3,Thu Jan 15 20:58:42 2015 UTC,Curtin also happy with pick and was upset he was at the combine cuz other teams might see him  so looks like the powers that be are on board with him so i say choo choo
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,--smokeandmirrors--,4,Thu Jan 15 21:09:02 2015 UTC,I like this pick.  Seems high risk high reward.
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,xxtoejamfootballxx,9,Thu Jan 15 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say a low risk. If he sucks, he gets cut with no real consequences."
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:39:41 2015 UTC,By high risk I meant higher possibility he doesn't work out.
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,xxtoejamfootballxx,2,Thu Jan 15 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"Well mock drafts had him as high as 8, and almost every time in the first round, so not risky in my book."
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,drewuke,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:56:05 2015 UTC,Yeah but the reason he was passed on in that round is because nobody knows how to legitimately rate him because there's no good basis for comparison.
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,xxtoejamfootballxx,3,Thu Jan 15 21:55:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like a normal draft to me.
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,drewuke,6,Thu Jan 15 21:59:19 2015 UTC,I guess.  I'm just saying that there were players available that we know a lot more about and can judge against other available players.  I like this pick because it's ambitious and not just the safest option.
PhillyUnion,2sjtor,xxtoejamfootballxx,3,Thu Jan 15 22:00:29 2015 UTC,I agree with you. :)

PhillyUnion,2sjtor,FlapjackJackson,2,Thu Jan 15 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"Two separate positions. Catic will be a striker, and Pfeffer is an attacking mid."

PhillyUnion,2sddhq,zlintner1,2,Wed Jan 14 20:44:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I never really anticipated it going over well. I really just wanted to see just how bad it could be.
PhillyUnion,2sbyqb,ignoramis,5,Tue Jan 13 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"Ideally, I'd like to see him used primarily as the guy who comes on when Maidana comes off, and the guy who starts at attacking midfield in USOC and friendly matches.  Knowing the Union's track record, though, I would not be surprised in the least to see the Union throw him out at striker."
PhillyUnion,2sbyqb,funkyquasar,2,Wed Jan 14 00:27:44 2015 UTC,It'd be great to see the younger players get more play time. Especially during the USOC.

PhillyUnion,2sbyqb,funkyquasar,5,Wed Jan 14 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"He will definitely be getting playing time this year, considering Fred and Ribeiro aren't going to be on the team. There is literally nobody else on the team who plays an advanced midfield position well (please don't say Leo Fernandes). He also signed a new deal, which hopefully includes some sort of minutes clause or something like that. Unless we sign someone in the next month or so, he's playing."
PhillyUnion,2sbyqb,pefsu13,2,Wed Jan 14 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he was out of contact at the end of last season. There was a lot of talk about him not resigning with the club. I'm not 100% on his contract, but it seemed a confirmed fact he wasn't going to resign when it ended"
PhillyUnion,2sbyqb,flyersboys3,3,Wed Jan 14 05:39:20 2015 UTC,Nope. He and Jimmy re-signed.

PhillyUnion,2sbyqb,MrChips217,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"he should be put in midfield as depth behind nogs or le toux. Preferably on the wing, he seems to have decent pace and speed. Thats just what I think though!"
PhillyUnion,2scpkw,Pany215,3,Wed Jan 14 01:57:20 2015 UTC,"In order to get Bono we would have to trade up in the draft, which would be ridiculous. Not to say I wouldn't want him as a player, but we really don't need more gk drama.  My guess is we pick up one of the Harrisburg guys, Nick noble or Brian Sylvestre. Busch was great for sj last year, but the younger guys are surely cheaper."
PhillyUnion,2scpkw,thelonelyswineherd,1 point,Wed Jan 14 06:27:17 2015 UTC,I remember Sylvestre doing really well against us in the USOC last year. I'd be totally okay using him as the third option.
PhillyUnion,2scpkw,funkyquasar,1 point,Thu Jan 15 12:40:02 2015 UTC,I looked at the schedule and the fifa calendar and it looks like there are only 4 games during international breaks:   Chicago (March 29th) Portland (July 11th : concacaf gold cup is during this time) DC (July 26th : End of gold cup is this day) San Jose (September 5th)   I think someone like Busch who can be had for fairly cheap will be a good fit for the 4 games.
PhillyUnion,2scpkw,--smokeandmirrors--,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:34:49 2015 UTC,I thought this meant we signed 2015 goalkeepers.

PhillyUnion,2satuc,midwesternhousewives,3,Tue Jan 13 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"No, but he probably should have never left MLS. Did he even get much playing time with Cruz Azul?"
PhillyUnion,2satuc,drayb3,3,Tue Jan 13 18:55:33 2015 UTC,Na. Doesn't really have much to offer the club at this point.
PhillyUnion,2satuc,Dpw22393,3,Tue Jan 13 18:06:51 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if he is worth the allocation spot necessary.
PhillyUnion,2satuc,FlapjackJackson,2,Tue Jan 13 17:48:57 2015 UTC,Ah I didn't think of the allocation spot.  This league has so many weird rules.
PhillyUnion,2satuc,Mike81890,2,Tue Jan 13 20:52:56 2015 UTC,I personally think we shouldn't really pursue unless we get him veeery cheap and then we can use him as a backup in case nog or maidana gets hurt. I trust him a bit more than Cruz/Leo Fernandez. I don't see us getting him for really cheap though.  I also forgot he would take up an allocation spot since he left the mls.
PhillyUnion,2satuc,MrChips217,2,Tue Jan 13 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"No. Poor guy over-estimated his stock. He could make a comeback to MLS as a Christain Maidana type if he had the confidence he didn't have when he left, but not at the U. I imagine he'd want more money than he'd deserve too.  I'd love to see him succeed, but I can't imagine it'd be here."
PhillyUnion,2satuc,mthslhrookiecard,2,Wed Jan 14 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"nope...nope...nope...union did a great job of getting rid of the twins...no need for them. Focus on getting Sacha for a CM/CDM role, a Striker, and a LB."
PhillyUnion,2satuc,MrChips217,3,Tue Jan 13 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"Were the twins that bad? I don't think we should really pursue unless we get an amazing deal and then use him as a backup, I didn't think marfan/garfan were bad by any means."
PhillyUnion,2satuc,Husher315,3,Tue Jan 13 20:52:12 2015 UTC,They weren't bad for us but they weren't great either. Capable enough players but we have other needs to pursue.
PhillyUnion,2satuc,LocksTheFox,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:55:35 2015 UTC,"its not that they were bad,its more the Union did a good job at getting the maximum value for them. To see them come back they would have to take a massive contract reduction. They played good for their investment but to sink and more time or money into them would be a losing battle."
PhillyUnion,2s8141,frig_off_rick,10,Mon Jan 12 23:56:03 2015 UTC,"I would love it, but do not see it happening and I am not torn up about it.  I think we can find some value in someone from overseas that can produce as much and stay with us longer."
PhillyUnion,2s8141,in_the_against,2,Tue Jan 13 00:00:21 2015 UTC,but do you believe that our focus should be on a striker or mid or what have you?

PhillyUnion,2s8141,midwesternhousewives,4,Tue Jan 13 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"He'd take up too much of the salary. The U aren't a big money team no matter how much we all want them to be. They can't afford the risk.  If money wasn't the issue, I would love to see Altidore wearing the Blue and Gold."
PhillyUnion,2s8141,phancypheetz,6,Tue Jan 13 02:52:42 2015 UTC,I would rather have Sacha. I think for what Sunderland value Altidore (Defoe+ 3-5 Million) We could spend that money and get someone (Both a Striker and LB) who has more potential and fits the system. With Rene on board I have a bit more confidence the Union are going to follow his consultation and be selective and yet wise with there money. Going after Jozy is neither of those.
PhillyUnion,2s8141,solprose315,2,Tue Jan 13 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"I don't see it happening.  Sure I would love it, but Union simply does not have the cash to bring in a star like Altidore.  If/when we get a striker, it will most likely be someone on discount (older, coming off an injury like Casey) or more obscure but solid (Noguera, etc).  I'd love it, but i just don't see the U dropping big dollars for Jozy."

PhillyUnion,2s8141,Pany215,2,Tue Jan 13 06:29:28 2015 UTC,"He's not worth the money. We could get as productive if not more productive of a striker for significantly cheaper.  As for striker or mid, we need both. A big name striker won't help this team if we are starting Michael Lahoud as a defensive mid. It's not a sexy position, but defensive mid is one of the most important areas in the team."

PhillyUnion,2s8141,bit99,1 point,Tue Jan 13 01:11:34 2015 UTC,"Not a huge fan of Jozy but it would be a great move for the club...Philly is a top-five market, the club is five years old, and what do they really have to show for it?   Jozy's arrival would reinvigorate the fanbase + make the club relevant for all US Soccer fans...what J Jones did for the Revs x 100. Will never happen, but would be nice."

PhillyUnion,2s2wbl,Timothy-H,10,Sun Jan 11 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"There's about 4 years of observation on this....  It works when we need to put pressure on the opposing D back line or if the opposing D plays a high back line, he can use his speed to stretch them and run forward through.  Thats how most of his goals are scored.  It doesn't work if the D marks him close and plays back not allowing him to run forward into space.  He stinks if he can't go Rt 1 forward because his touch isn't great in tight space and he can't make use of his speed.  Keeping him on the right allows him to motor up and down the flank and takes advantage of his insane stamina and his good crossing.  It sometimes makes sense to move him to forward late in games when everyone's gassed and the field opens up end to end.  Seeing him run in open space forward is always some of the most exciting stuff fans see at PPL."
PhillyUnion,2s2wbl,dooper2010,9,Sun Jan 11 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"Team needs to find a legit DP talent level striker, especially if they continue the 4-5-1.  Nobody on the roster currently is a game in and game out goal scorer. Not Sapong, not Casey anymore, not LeToux."
PhillyUnion,2s2wbl,dooper2010,1 point,Sun Jan 11 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like Sapong COULD transition to a true 9, but I agree, we just need a DP level striker."
PhillyUnion,2s2wbl,Husher315,3,Tue Jan 13 19:25:44 2015 UTC,His speed is mostly gone as well. I wouldn't really say he is that fast. He just looks fast since we have a very slow team.
PhillyUnion,2s2wbl,FlapjackJackson,2,Sun Jan 11 23:02:49 2015 UTC,"when you looked at his goal numbers for when he played striker, and took out PKs, he had a bad scoring rate and doesnt offer much else at striker. He gets assists but he still gets the from the wing. It doesnt work that well"
PhillyUnion,2s2wbl,marksills,2,Sun Jan 11 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"Seba has terrible control in tight spaces, doesn't make decisions quick enough, and is a very poor passer.  He's very good chasing balls up and down the wing when there's more space, but he loses the ball way too much in the middle.  He doesn't work at striker."
PhillyUnion,2rzsn0,ignoramis,5,Sat Jan 10 20:38:35 2015 UTC,I'd really much rather see us bring a striker in but I wouldn't be against it if it were to happen
PhillyUnion,2rzsn0,bterre108,3,Sun Jan 11 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy if we signed Kljestan, you can never have too much depth in midfield. However I can't say I've seen too much of his play at Anderlecht; would he be able to take on a defensive role?"
PhillyUnion,2rzsn0,Cheddar229,3,Sat Jan 10 20:51:03 2015 UTC,Nobody's seen too much of his play at Anderlecht because he barely plays. 9 appearances this year and only 1 start
PhillyUnion,2rzsn0,LocksTheFox,0,Sat Jan 10 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"He plays a very similiar role to Nogueira. Kljestan could be played out of his natural position as a 10 or we could have him and Noggy play next to each other and switch off between who goes forward and who goes back similar to how Arsenal's mid works.  I don't think either are ideal, and I'd rather sign a player than fits rather than a big name."
PhillyUnion,2rzsn0,FlapjackJackson,3,Sun Jan 11 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"i feel pretty similar to how i felt when Edu came in. Not a top midfielder, or even a top American midfielder.

I bet he would cost more than Maidana and Nogs and I'm also not sure he's better than them.  Resources need to go towards a DP level talent forward and a d-mid or center-back depending on where Edu actually lines up.  Hopefully there's enough restraint to pass and address the needs.  There wasn't last year that's for sure."

PhillyUnion,2rzsn0,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sun Jan 11 16:20:17 2015 UTC,"In a basic 3 man midfield, you need a destroyer, a shuttler, and a creator. We have a shuttler (Nogueira) and a creator (Maidana). However, Sacha is not a destroyer. He is a shuttler. For Anderlecht, he is typically a deep-lying playmaker that links the defense to the attack. He is not a ball winner.  A midfield of Sacha, Noggy, and Maidana would be easily overrun in MLS. To put it another way, Arsenal plays a similar style of midfield to this, and their lack of a true DM has been a consistent problem for that team."
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,LocksTheFox,10,Thu Jan 8 18:34:53 2015 UTC,Best news so far this off-season
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,akuller,6,Thu Jan 8 19:39:27 2015 UTC,Losing Okugo opens the possibility of Edu returning to CDM. I'm not sure he wants to keep playing CB.
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,Luzzi15,9,Thu Jan 8 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"The main point for CB is that it is his best chance to get back into the national team. We are strong at DM and super weak at CB.  EDIT: I am referring to the USMNT, not the Union. The US is deep at DM and weak at CB."
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,FlapjackJackson,2,Thu Jan 8 21:08:07 2015 UTC,"Are we that strong at CDM though? We lost Okugo, and that really just leaves Nog and Lahoud at CDM. Pfeiffer plays higher up and White & Berry aren't versatile enough or move up to DM like Edu."
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,Luzzi15,2,Thu Jan 8 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"I meant the USMNT, not the Union."
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,FlapjackJackson,2,Thu Jan 8 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"Why do you say super weak?   I'm assuming Valdes will benefit hugely from some time off after a World Cup year. That might not happen, or maybe he leaves town after all but if he stays I'm fairly certain he's still all-star material.  I'm happy enough with White's game, at least as long as his relatively poor distribution improves.   Berry had such a generally difficult year in 2014 that I think he deserves a clean slate to start 2015.  And it sounds like Richie Marquez had a good season with the City Islanders."

PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,goatyhead,2,Thu Jan 8 21:49:06 2015 UTC,If he wants to play DM that's AOK by me. I think there is a ton of potential for him and Nogueira as a tandem with regular minutes.
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,goatyhead,2,Thu Jan 8 20:20:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. Losing a D-mid gave us a lot of flexibility. I think we've got Edu and Nog starting  at CDM with Lahoud (who we know Curtin loves) as a backup/depth option. We also can now get White and Berry both into the defensive rotation alongside Valdes.
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,Luzzi15,2,Thu Jan 8 20:37:05 2015 UTC,This move shows that the players are buying into the culture/direction of the Union. Big fan.
PhillyUnion,2rrn0z,leclair929,-4,Thu Jan 8 23:08:08 2015 UTC,Culture of losing? I certainly hope they're not buying into the one constant in the Union's short history.

He was riding pine at Stoke. I'm sure it's no fun working out every (other?) day to find yourself neglected. I just hope they utilize him better. Get positions filled. He's said numerous times he doesn't like playing CB. Maybe he does now? Maybe he does see it as a chance to gain favor with the German? I met him twice. Once at a Bilal? (I was drunk) concert in Mt. Airy. Once at an art show in Rittenhouse. I didn't fawn, acknowledge, or introduce. He seems content. I liked that. Not showy. Humble. Ramble... I once literally ran into Chase Utley. I slipped on ice on Jeweler's Row. He was like ""Fuck you asshole"" and then he spit on me. I hate him. (Actually, he caught me while I was slipping - lightning fast reflexes. He said ""Whoa, buddy. You alright?"" I said (so dumb) ""Are you are who I think you are?"" He said ""Yup. You ok? Sorry, I have to get going."" I said, ""But, Jesus.... I have so many questions."" He laughed.

I would have never thought this could have even been a possibility a year ago, but it's clear our FO has some skewed vision for where we need to develop and grow as a team.  It was pretty obvious that MacMath leaving was going to be the result of M'Bohli coming in, but we should have never signed him to begin with."
PhillyUnion,2rjx7q,risefromruins,3,Tue Jan 6 21:15:40 2015 UTC,I am not pissed it happened at all. It wasn't until Zak had to play for his spot that he performed. Everybody wanted him gone every year up until MBohli came in and the keeper jokes started pouring in. MBohli hasn't been given enough of a shot to really evaluate if he is worth the money or not. As far as i'm concerned this is a tie in terms of who wins in this transfer. Both teams can now address needs one way or another and the dumb fucking goalie jokes can finally end...hopefully.
PhillyUnion,2rjx7q,MrChips217,4,Tue Jan 6 23:48:23 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. If he lives up to his hype, M'Bolhi will be a top keeper in this league. We need more top quality players all around."

PhillyUnion,2rjx7q,MortalSmurph,2,Wed Jan 7 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"Key word ""hype"" he has bounced around a lot and that only happens for specific reasons.

PhillyUnion,2rglsg,LocksTheFox,9,Tue Jan 6 00:48:30 2015 UTC,I don't care what happened against Chicago. I think M'Bohli is a better option than Zak. The most annoying thing is all anybody did was complain about Zak and now that he is leaving everybody is like ZAK NOOOOOOO. Give me a break. We will be just fine without Zak as long as we have M'Bohli and Blake we have an amazing pair of goalies that are begging for a break through...Zak just isn't as appealing when stacked next to both of them.
PhillyUnion,2rglsg,MrChips217,6,Tue Jan 6 13:49:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that overall MBohli is better, but if you look at costs... I don't think the extra amount Rais costs is worth the slight edge over Zak.  Zak may not be the best keeper, but he's good enough and improving. We could have taken the money we used on Mbohli and gotten a star striker.  Zak isn't why we lost games last season.    Although I do find it funny just 2 years ago most in this sub were calling for Zak's head and that we needed a better keeper.  Now that he's going everyone is upset.  Philly fans man... we're impossible."
PhillyUnion,2rglsg,midwesternhousewives,2,Tue Jan 6 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"Do the costs justify the means? I think its tough to say. If he has golden gloves this year then yeah they do. Who knows what M'Bohli will be after the new CBA.   The now official loan to Colorado is a really really smart move for the union. Here is why: 1.) He is still our player, so if MBohli doesnt work out guess who we can turn too again. 2.) He is going to get valuable playing time which he would not have gotten here. 3.) If MBohli does work and kills it then Zak can stay at the rapids possibly.   It just makes sense I don't know why people would be upset about it."
PhillyUnion,2rglsg,MrChips217,2,Tue Jan 6 23:30:25 2015 UTC,"The big problem with that is that if we have a game on an international break, we lose both of them."
PhillyUnion,2rglsg,TheDuckyNinja,2,Tue Jan 6 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"potentially, yes this is true, but im sorry than you bring in somebody young and willing to develop and take some lumps. Right now we have 3 starting caliber goalies. that is 1 too many so if somebody has to go...it should be Zak."

They know we've got too many keepers and need to get rid of one so they have the upper hand setting the terms. They get him on loan to test him out and see if he'll work for them and at the end of the loan period, regardless of his performance, they know we'll still need to get rid of a keeper so their bargaining position won't be impacted much."

Because seriously, we're now in to the first week of January and our offseason so far consists of losing Okugo, Casey, and Ribeiro for nothing and bringing in a backup striker.  This team has a LOT of work to do to inspire ANY confidence, and the only rumor that seems to have any possibility is bringing in a DM who can't get in the lineup for an English Championship team."

There is no direct quote from M'Bolhi on there, and it seems pretty speculative. Also, even though he had a pretty incredible world cup I would be surprised if any scouts watching his few performances for us would be all that excited by his goalkeeping. Still don't know why we have three starting keepers in our lineup..."
PhillyUnion,2rbd3f,notnewton1,3,Sun Jan 4 19:25:45 2015 UTC,"Classic M'Bolhi hate. I highly doubt this is true. The source is from an Algerian journalist who are known for making things up. Every Algerian player has been linked to Barca or Man Utd in the past few years. These journos like to stir the pot and they caused the last NT coach (Vahid Halilhodzic) to leave post-World Cup because of how unprofessional they are. Aside from one or two reputable journalists, there is absolutely no integrity in sports journalism in Algeria.   The camp for the Algeria NT for the African Cup started and M'Bolhi hasn't said a single thing. M'Bolhi himself believes the U.S offers a lot in opportunity and stability in his footballing career which wasn't offered in various European leagues. These are direct quotes from M'Bolhi. He has said this multiple times and  if you watched his interview on CliqueTV (posted on the Philadelphia Union official website) you would know he feels pretty strongly about this."

PhillyUnion,2prg12,akuller,3,Fri Dec 19 05:48:58 2014 UTC,They seem pretty cool! but they are kinda low res but I guess it depends on how they are displayed. can make them vectorized?
PhillyUnion,2prg12,garr1s0n,3,Fri Dec 19 05:56:59 2014 UTC,they actually are vector! they are just small ( no bigger than 30 x 30) I will try to look into improving quality though!
PhillyUnion,2prg12,garr1s0n,2,Fri Dec 19 05:59:53 2014 UTC,How are you exporting? Try 24-bit png if you're not already doing so
PhillyUnion,2prg12,drewuke,2,Fri Dec 19 14:55:13 2014 UTC,Ill give that a shot and re-save them! Thanks!
PhillyUnion,2prg12,garr1s0n,1 point,Fri Dec 19 16:04:41 2014 UTC,"no prob.  depending on what you're using to export, it might be defaulting to 8-bit png, which for most applications is fine, but 24- bit has higher color depth and much clearer borders on transparency."
PhillyUnion,2prg12,garr1s0n,2,Fri Dec 19 16:21:33 2014 UTC,I think it worked they do look much better!

PhillyUnion,2pqno6,MrChips217,3,Fri Dec 19 00:48:58 2014 UTC,I found it interesting that Bakary and Chandler both got picked up.
PhillyUnion,2pqno6,funkyquasar,1 point,Fri Dec 19 03:09:06 2014 UTC,Is there seriously nobody we could have used as depth?
PhillyUnion,2pqno6,akuller,3,Fri Dec 19 01:25:31 2014 UTC,I think they basically become free agents now and can negotiate with any league or team they want. So we may be able to get one of these player for way cheaper than they may think there worth for much lower risk.
PhillyUnion,2pqno6,funkyquasar,1 point,Fri Dec 19 02:55:46 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I hope so. I guess they figured either a) there were enough players they wanted that they could wait until ""free agency"" and renegotiate at lower salaries or b) they have eyes at other depth options who weren't involved with Re-Entry. All we can do is wait, I guess."
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,gregzorian,7,Thu Dec 18 21:30:43 2014 UTC,"I can live with Wenger and Le Toux on the wings for another year but there is really no depth there. Sorry, Cruz is not depth for a team that is trying to improve.   The Union need a holding mid now that Okugo is gone and they still need a striker. Cubo would be nice but it's not realistic.  Then they need depth everywhere but goalie and right back, and lots of it."
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,beggarb,1 point,Thu Dec 18 22:09:17 2014 UTC,"They need to see what McGlaughlin can do. If he can play at this level, he is the kind of winger that they want: fast AND technical, albeit small.  I wonder if they still play Edu as CB? Depends on how things shake out with Valdes I guess..."
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,keystonemike,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:36:30 2014 UTC,"Mo and Nog may not be ""holding mids"" but that part of the field would get crowded real quick if we added one."

PhillyUnion,2pq16j,LocksTheFox,11,Mon Dec 22 01:09:02 2014 UTC,I honestly don't see anything in brek Shea except that he needs an attitude adjustment. We never had a chance with Cubo so it's a non-issue for me.
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,Keepa1,1 point,Thu Dec 18 21:55:33 2014 UTC,It's actually scary how accurate you are. But also kinda sad that we never even had a shot at Cubo.
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,a_lintner7,3,Tue Jan 6 00:02:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I don't think Philly has a chance with Shea, to many connections to OCSC: *Trained with OCSC last year, already knows the staff and some players; knowledge of the play style *The connection between Stoke City and Orlando City (OCSC Pres Phil Rawlins used to be a board member and higher up at Stoke) *Shea's former agent (Paul McDonough) is no the OCSC GM  Sorry....  well, not really :)"
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,daguru9,2,Thu Dec 18 21:52:06 2014 UTC,Fine without shea. That would leave us in a Freddy adu situation

PhillyUnion,2pq16j,mtommyboy,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:02:10 2014 UTC,It's not the league's fault that the Union are willing to do nothing to bring good players here.
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,drewuke,1 point,Thu Dec 18 22:11:49 2014 UTC,Cubo would do amazing things for this team...Shea not so much. I feel Matt Kassel may have effectively ruined his chance in europe. Orlando could be making a mistake by bringing him back and as time progresses im starting to dislike their team more and more.
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,MrChips217,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:46:35 2014 UTC,Shea ruined his own chances by going over when he was clearly not ready.
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:46:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah that maybe true, but he was at least making progress until Kassel came in and messed his leg up. Haven't heard much from him since. Hearing its a 4 year deal now could be costly to them and him if it doesn't pan out."
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,MrChips217,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:56:18 2014 UTC,"So the league gets to send him to whoever they want, i.e. whatever suits the league best? Any info is appreciated.   Kinda sorta yea. They'll send him to whomever will pay his salary but he stated he wants to stay in LA so I bet that'll probably happen, either immediately with the Galaxy or eventually with LAFC (I.E someone gets him till 2017 then he joins LAFC)"
PhillyUnion,2pq16j,-smokeandmirrors-,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:55:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah, no.  We can't afford Cubo and Shea wouldn't bring much to our squad.  I'm more jealous of jealous of Octavio Rivero going to WCFC."

PhillyUnion,2pq16j,SirMothy,0,Tue Jan 6 22:11:54 2015 UTC,I don't want Shea anywhere near the team. That would be a disaster. I'm hoping the FO can complete the one transfer that we need to complete the most in EDU.

PhillyUnion,2pmgia,bterre108,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:57:56 2014 UTC,Nyassi would be a fantastic pickup. Complements our attacking players well.
PhillyUnion,2pmgia,IPlei,3,Thu Dec 18 08:26:33 2014 UTC,Osvaldo Minda: Absolutely not. Would be okay with Wynne or Segares though.
PhillyUnion,2pmgia,AdFinemFidelis,2,Thu Dec 18 00:51:00 2014 UTC,Martin Rivero definitely has me raising an eye brow.
PhillyUnion,2pmgia,jpoRS,2,Wed Dec 17 22:52:07 2014 UTC,"3 wingers, 1 RB, 3 CB, 1 AM, 2 HM, and 1 LB. So that's one position we actually need help with (LB) and more depth in positions we're comfortable in?"
PhillyUnion,2pmgia,_asper,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:26:31 2014 UTC,Basically. Depth is always a good thing.
PhillyUnion,2pmgia,bterre108,1 point,Thu Dec 18 15:23:39 2014 UTC,Or ya know...we could just pass
PhillyUnion,2pkw2w,beggarb,4,Wed Dec 17 14:53:55 2014 UTC,"I actually expect CJ to be a winger. Rotate Seba, Wenger, and him."
PhillyUnion,2pkw2w,emptythecache,5,Wed Dec 17 21:38:16 2014 UTC,"He might be deployed out wide, but I have a feeling that he won't play as a winger. Sapong's aerial ability and physical presence might lend itself to a wide target role,  a la the 1990's Norway team.  In a game where we're expecting to do a lot of defending, Sapong could offer a long clearance option out wide. Our defensive players could just hoof the ball down line to him if they're under too much pressure to play their way out of the back.   If he's out wide, he can bully the opposing fullback to win air balls (note: fullbacks are generally shorter and weaker than center backs) . He could then take the defender on and cut in, hold it until the onrushing midfielders catch up, or lay it off to the center forward.   Having CJ up top out wide also allows us to play a more industrious center forward who contributes in buildup play and helps out on defense without sacrificing our ability to counterattack. No matter who we play, Le Toux, Wenger, or Casey in the middle, they would have the freedom to come deep for the ball and create or pressure the midfield knowing that Sapong is still on the opposition's shoulders. It also makes the opposing fullback less likely to bomb forward if he knows that the hole he leaves in the defense is going to be exploited."
PhillyUnion,2pkw2w,LongDongShagswell,3,Thu Dec 18 08:12:11 2014 UTC,I see him as 2nd striker maybe a change of pace player.  If you read the article putting him on the wing is a waste of his talent in the air. Also his passing in the SKC system was sub-par.
PhillyUnion,2pkw2w,akuller,1 point,Wed Dec 17 21:48:32 2014 UTC,"He didn't fit in SKC system anymore. They put him out wide. To see if he fit there. He didn't obviously. To say SKC can't pass or cross is absurd. Zusi has one of the best crosses in MLS. They changed their system to not rely on crosses. They rely on short passes. Sapong was no longer relevant when Dwyer was signed. We don't have an inkling of a Zusi, so don't expect Sapong to be anything more than a last second super-sub. Sapong would be great if we signed Jozy.  Edit: I read your comment wrong. Sorry. So wrong."
PhillyUnion,2pkw2w,midwesternhousewives,3,Wed Dec 24 08:56:19 2014 UTC,Is CJ their answer to a top striker or was he just brought to add some depth?
PhillyUnion,2pkw2w,akuller,8,Wed Dec 17 21:06:32 2014 UTC,I'm hoping just depth. But with this FO who knows.
PhillyUnion,2pe33p,peewoah1,40,Mon Dec 15 20:08:27 2014 UTC,"We should lock NickSak & Ruben Amaro in a room and let them fight to the death, then kill the winner"

PhillyUnion,2pdtab,midwesternhousewives,5,Mon Dec 15 20:18:41 2014 UTC,"This is a quietly damning indictment of the club... the bona fide offer sounds cheap, the facilities sound cheap, and the talk has—historically—been cheap.  Now, I understand that he didn't want to play second fiddle to Mo, who Curtin sees as the everyday CDM, fine. But it seems like Okugo realized a few years ago that this was not the place to get used to a competitive professional environment. It's like he knows that he needs to spend a few years in Orlando to get back up to speed before trying Europe..."
PhillyUnion,2pdtab,keystonemike,1 point,Tue Dec 16 04:16:37 2014 UTC,"I'm astounded to hear how bad things are on the professional development side of things. Did they not do any due diligence to see what it takes to actually run a team or is the ownership that strapped for cash?   Either way it's a little scary to hear that simple things like a nutrition plan weren't in place until recently, especially when you have a large number of guys on (relatively) low salaries."
PhillyUnion,2pdtab,goatyhead,2,Tue Dec 16 14:16:19 2014 UTC,"According to Amobi,  the U coudn't even provide pre and post workout meals, and that is one of the many things that led him to believe Orlando was a better fit. until 3 years in! 3 fucking years!!

PhillyUnion,2p4a8k,squid919,7,Sat Dec 13 00:21:59 2014 UTC,"Because Fabinho is still better value for the team. We already have bench midfielders, especially Pfeffer. Although Pedro has the size, he isn't a target forward.  Note Curtin's lip service to ""making Pedro a top no. 10 in our league."" That would be extremely surprising.  They went with the sure thing, and it makes sense. Hopefully we have depth across the board and can rotate our squad a bit.

Even without Edu we still have Berry and White laying around and I don't think either wants to sit on the bench all year.  This is all if Valdes actually stays...if he stays, I think CB is the least of our concerns right now (and GK). I'd rather have a natural LB (that's better than Fabinho), a new CDM (I think Edu's best at CB, so I want someone that can win balls for Noggy), and a proven striker (duh) than another CB"

The season ticket package and the SoB membership both come with scarves nearly every year, so you normally see a lot wearing that season's scarf.

PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,LocksTheFox,11,Wed Dec 10 20:06:04 2014 UTC,I think people think way too highly of Ribeiro and not enough of Fabinho
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,thanksbastards,3,Thu Dec 11 02:34:54 2014 UTC,"Ribeiro supposedly had more upside. What Fabi is now is basically what we get. I don't hate him. He's an average attacking option on the left. He at least has a left foot, links up well with Maidana when they play together, and looks to get forward more often than not. Problem is he's short and doesn't have a lot of sustained pace which makes him a liability on defense. His positioning has gotten better though.   I don't mind Fabi for depth on the left, lord knows we need it, but we'll never really know what Ribeiro's potential would have been."
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,EdBacon,2,Thu Dec 11 06:06:25 2014 UTC,Until he scores 10 goals for Orlando next season.
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,emptythecache,3,Thu Dec 11 13:48:48 2014 UTC,"I... I sorta doubt that will happen. He's not even really a finisher, more of a CAM."
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,EdBacon,2,Thu Dec 11 16:00:28 2014 UTC,"it was a 100% irrational prediction, i just mean we do have a way to know Ribeiro's potential, since we'll see him at OCSC."
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,emptythecache,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:12:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah I know. Still, what he does for OCSC might not be what he would have done here. Could be a good thing for him... given our track record with developing young players it probably will be a good thing for him."
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,EdBacon,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:15:21 2014 UTC,"I think they valued a left-footed fullback more than a backup midfielder. Ribeiro was probably not going to be playing as a long striker over Global Search, Sapong, or (now) Casey. Meanwhile, in the 10 slot we have Maidana and (hopefully) Pfeffer to get some minutes, so he probably wouldn't get too many minutes there either.  Meanwhile, as we have learned the past few seasons, you need depth on your backline.  Also, on the CBS podcast, Albright added: Fabi is relatively cheap and he is a good teammate."
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,keystonemike,6,Sat Dec 13 06:16:04 2014 UTC,"As much as I love to hate on Sak's personnel choices, it is no longer his say. It's all Albright/Muelensteen/Curtin now."
PhillyUnion,2ow9yy,rnc487,4,Wed Dec 10 20:12:22 2014 UTC,"I don't think Meulensteen was/should have been trusted with this list. he doesn't know our players at all unless he's secretly been studying them all year.  If that is in fact the case, then maybe we should be worried about Meulensteen..."

I mean at this point, I guess I'm just going to have to trust what is done by Albright/Curtin/Meulensteen(and co), even if it doesn't make sense to me. What else can we do at this point? If Meulensteen and his group have been watching the team for long enough to justify some of the decisions then there's a chance their decisions might be correct?

PhillyUnion,2ow5si,in_the_against,9,Wed Dec 10 21:18:07 2014 UTC,"Hey people:   Mike Lahoud wasn't preferred to Ribeiro. He was protected after, using the protect we got for having a player drafted. When has Ribeiro ever shown that he can be an MLS starter? I have serious doubts about his quality and about OCSC's FO for drafting him. Some have mentioned on twitter that Fabinho was preferred to Ribeiro. This is NOT the case. Which players get protected is not a simple ""protect top 11 players"". It has to do with the needs of the team(s) that is doing the drafting, the players that may or may not e available from other teams, the transfer market, the salary of each player, the other players on our team (depth at certain positions), and the upside of the players. We certainly don't have all the information involved in the decision made by the FO to determine whether it was wrong or write. Moreover, if you thought it was a bad decision to leave him unprotected, then you should have said something when he was left unprotected, not when the draft happened. Whether the FO made the right or wrong decision in leaving him unprotected is not affected by whether he got drafted, only by the information they had at the time."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,in_the_against,2,Wed Dec 10 22:24:57 2014 UTC,"He did not have time to show much. He got playing time during our crash at the end of the season, thrown into a position he doesn't play, and he still managed to score 3 goals.   While you are somewhat correct in the fact that it wasn't Fabinho or Ribeiro, in the end we had to pick 11 to protect and they protected a half rate left midfielder who we play as a back up LB instead of a 6'4"" attacking midfielder who hasn't reached his prime."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,-smokeandmirrors-,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:13:35 2014 UTC,I never specified who I preferred. But I would prefer a young talent with potential in Ribeiro. I have no complaint of protecting Lahoud after Ribeiro was selected we need some depth at CDM. To your final point I had him in my list of who should be protected so get your facts.
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,Keepa1,6,Thu Dec 11 04:04:32 2014 UTC,"I just don't understand.   Why would we want a 6'4"" left footed player..."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,ronaldo119,3,Wed Dec 10 19:36:31 2014 UTC,You think with the Okugo trade we would have a hand shake only take players we don't want anyway.
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,jpoRS,5,Wed Dec 10 19:37:39 2014 UTC,Hold the pitchforks. Kevin Kinkead seems to think there's potentially more involved with the whole situation...  Not gonna get my hopes up but still it might be something   edit: it's nothing :\

PhillyUnion,2ow5si,Keepa1,5,Wed Dec 10 23:04:35 2014 UTC,It is the potential that is intriguing. He has good touch and skill and is big.

PhillyUnion,2ow5si,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Dec 12 04:27:15 2014 UTC,someone already stated that he has scored more goals than CJ Sapong over the course of the season in half the minutes. honestly he's done better than so many other people on our roster the last 5 years. he's worth keeping. it's a no brainer. and instead we protect Fabhi and Lahoud. I'm fucking bitter about it.
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,Keepa1,1 point,Wed Dec 10 21:54:04 2014 UTC,"While I don't think that Fabinho is anything special I think he is worth keeping because he's a left back which is a very difficult position to fill and we don't have anybody else who naturally plays there. Yes, Gaddis does a fine job there but he's best on the right and offers nothing going forward on the left. Look at teams across the world and you'll be hard pressed to find many quality left backs.   Lahoud we probably lacking depth in CM right now with Carroll and Okugo out. I probably wouldn't have protected him but we didn't have another player selected so it doesn't really matter.  Sapong has been played out of position for SKC a lot this year I would blame that on a big part of him not scoring many since his quality first couple years. Ribeiro is probably the best player we left unprotected outside of the keepers but I'm just saying I'm not upset about losing him I just didn't see him turning into anything more than a quality sub option"
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:07:29 2014 UTC,We played Ribeiro out of position as well.
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,DoubleHappyDave,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:21:00 2014 UTC,Pedro was played as a striker. Sapong was played as a winger. You can't really compare the two.

PhillyUnion,2ow5si,LocksTheFox,1 point,Fri Dec 12 17:26:48 2014 UTC,"Being the tallest midget isn't really much of an accomplishment.  Pedro looked completely lost up top. His positioning is poor and his runs were even worse. He always looked a step behind. He just happened to be big, and that's it.  I can understand anyone who thought we should have kept him as a midfielder (which is a fair point). However, he was a terrible striker."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,jpoRS,1 point,Fri Dec 12 17:50:22 2014 UTC,"Yes i agree! but we're talking about playing out of position andno matter how uncoordinated he looked, he still got the job done. that says a lot to me. I believe he should be played as a mid and we'll see what he turns into with Orlando. i just wish we could have kept him instead."

PhillyUnion,2ow5si,a_lintner7,8,Fri Dec 12 18:07:09 2014 UTC,"Relax guys.  If we have to worry about losing Ribeiro then we are pretty screwed already.  At best he was to back up Chaco, which I hope Pfeffer will be doing.    Now lets trade a goalie for a LB, and sign a DP striker.  Those moves are what will really matter."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,HandsomePete215,5,Wed Dec 10 22:03:13 2014 UTC,"We can't sign a DP striker.  We've got Edu, Maidana, and M'bohli.  No one is going to take M'bohli in a trade as they wouldn't want to waste a DP spot, and unless we can buy his contract down with Garber Bucks, we're stuck with him.  I agree with not worrying about losing Ribeiro. 3 starts, 9 apps, 2 goals, 103 passes.  I understand he was a prospect but if the Mule didn't see a need for him, then the Mule didn't want him."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,a_lintner7,5,Wed Dec 10 22:13:12 2014 UTC,"We're likely going to buy down M'Bolhi with GBs. Plus keep in mind Edu is on loan, we still have to buy him."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,LocksTheFox,3,Wed Dec 10 22:34:56 2014 UTC,"Plus with the new CBA, who knows what the DP rules could be? Ceiling could be raised moving one or more of our DPs off the list, or they could add more DP slots, or both."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,Keepa1,2,Wed Dec 10 23:07:05 2014 UTC,"with this FO we may have signed our ""DP"" quality striker already. Also the potential in Ribeiro is what was lost. Also we never played him in his best position in central midfield so we will never know could he have been a replacement for okugo."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,rabidfrodo,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:06:59 2014 UTC,"I can't fault the front office when it comes to off season moves.  They hit it out of the park with Chaco and Noggy.  Edu and Wenger were also very good moves, especially with Okugo gone.  If they can just have a little of that success this offseason, next year will be fun."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,AngryHugo,5,Thu Dec 11 15:18:07 2014 UTC,Am I the only one who really doesn't like Ribeiro? The man's so slow it looks like a joke when he's running.
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Dec 11 03:16:37 2014 UTC,"I realize he was played out of position, but I'm with you. I don't see it as a major loss. He might end up being great, but the minutes he did get were less than impressive."
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,Keepa1,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:57:42 2014 UTC,He wasn't really played out of position though that's the problem. We drafted him as a striker. He played striker in college and honestly I thought he was a great pick but he's too slow like even Casey burned him
PhillyUnion,2ow5si,bluestaples,2,Fri Dec 12 02:25:16 2014 UTC,We drafted him as a CAM...

PhillyUnion,2osw4y,drewuke,4,Wed Dec 10 00:33:09 2014 UTC,My biggest problem is signing the starting GK of a national team. You are   guaranteeing that he misses a number of games. Why. ugh.
PhillyUnion,2osw4y,keystonemike,6,Wed Dec 10 03:13:21 2014 UTC,"Well the problem would be instantly solved if MLS took breaks during scheduled fifa international breaks, which they don't seem to consistently do.

PhillyUnion,2osw4y,TheDuckyNinja,6,Wed Dec 10 01:07:12 2014 UTC,"If that's the attitude, then the Union shouldn't have paid that much either, and they messed up by paying that much for him in the first place."
PhillyUnion,2osw4y,empossible,1 point,Wed Dec 10 02:47:29 2014 UTC,I'd say if that was the attitude then they should have protected Zac so they could actually get something of value for a MLS quality starting keeper.
PhillyUnion,2osw4y,marksills,1 point,Wed Dec 10 17:04:28 2014 UTC,yup this sums it up. No other team besides the union would be stupid enough to pay this much for mbolhi

PhillyUnion,2orej1,sayhey36,1 point,Tue Dec 9 19:06:11 2014 UTC,He is on loan from a Jamaican Team so I'm not sure if the Union are proceeding with negotiations at this time. We only own the right to negotiate with him more or less right now.

PhillyUnion,2os79j,MrChips217,6,Tue Dec 9 19:22:49 2014 UTC,M'Bolhi and Lahoud.  M'Bolhi simply costs way too much and isn't appreciably better than MacMath.  Lahoud is so painful to watch any time the ball comes to his feet that I really just don't want to watch it anymore.
PhillyUnion,2os79j,TheDuckyNinja,2,Tue Dec 9 19:52:30 2014 UTC,Excluding guys whose options were declined: Hoppenot and Lahoud.
PhillyUnion,2os79j,LocksTheFox,2,Tue Dec 9 19:28:03 2014 UTC,"Lahoud and Hoppenot. Hoppenot got next to nothing done last year, and the impact sub spot he was squatting it should go to a younger, more tactically flexible prospect, or CJ Sapong, depending on whether or not the search for a forward is actually successful.  I kinda like Lahoud. But he's the 3rd best holding midfielder on the roster right now, he's fairly expensive, he takes up an international slot, and he misses time to play for Sierra Leone. Two of those things would be enough to consider cutting him, all four is a no brainer."
PhillyUnion,2os79j,MagicMoniker,3,Tue Dec 9 22:27:44 2014 UTC,"Well, corben, fred, conor, and brown all were waived so they're probably gone anyway.  I kinda want M'bohli to be taken, especially with the news that he is a DP. Hopefully that changes with the new CBA.  Wheeler and hoppenot, for all of the complaints they get, are pretty cheap to have on board. about 100,000 combined. I don't really see anyone who is way better coming in for their salaries.   I would have to say lahoud, for the minutes he played, is not worth it. He also can be a bit inconsistent.   Honestly our whole squad here that didn't get waived makes around minimum, or a reasonable salary considering. Berry makes 85ish, zac 120, leo 48, pedro and richie are minimum salaries. Danny cruz at 125 is a little high, but he at least plays a lot, and he is good depth if he is used correctly.   Danny would probably have to be my second choice if we needed to choose, but if we have a player picked that isn't a goalie i fully expect Danny to be the next one protected."
PhillyUnion,2os79j,arkr,3,Tue Dec 9 19:38:03 2014 UTC,M'Bolhi and Cruz.
PhillyUnion,2os79j,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue Dec 9 19:34:06 2014 UTC,Why Cruz? Lack of Skill? Allocation Money? Both?

PhillyUnion,2orkdr,Invol2ver,3,Tue Dec 9 16:15:58 2014 UTC,According to Kevin's follow-up tweets it seems likely that if the DP threshold stays the same through the CBA talks (it may go up and Rais may lose his DP status) the Union could use allocation money to buy down his salary to below the threshold.  This would free up a DP slot for what I hope is a foreign goal-scorer.
PhillyUnion,2orkdr,Invol2ver,2,Tue Dec 9 16:33:02 2014 UTC,I wonder who we might be looking at in foreign leagues. Calling it now: another guy in Ligue 1 or Ligue 2.
PhillyUnion,2orkdr,akuller,3,Tue Dec 9 16:35:46 2014 UTC,Not sure but looking in French leagues seems natural as a good piece of our up-front power in Nogueira and Le Toux are native French speakers. It would make sense.  I know Le Toux can speak english OK but I don't think Nog speaks any. I don't think its necessarily a limiting factor but at least something to consider.
PhillyUnion,2orkdr,thelostdolphin,3,Tue Dec 9 17:10:51 2014 UTC,"M'Bolhi also presumably speaks French. Algeria basically has 3 national languages: Arabic, Berber, and French."

He never lived in Algeria at all. He's an Algerian National Team player because his mother was born there and he qualifies for dual citizenship. He played for the French national team for many years when he was young, but there are only so many opportunities for a GK, so he decided to go with Algeria instead."
PhillyUnion,2orkdr,jpoRS,1 point,Wed Dec 10 16:54:22 2014 UTC,M'Bolhi and his mother moved to Algeria after she separated from his father.
PhillyUnion,2orkdr,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:38:31 2014 UTC,"His mother immigrated to France from Algeria before M'Bohli was born. Maybe you extrapolated the fact that she's originally from there with him growing up there since she's who raised him?  He played in youth leagues in Paris, in particular Racing Paris, from when he was 8 or 9 years old and then moved to Marseilles during his teen years. The first time he lived outside of France, to my knowledge, was actually in Scotland when he played soccer in Edinburgh.   If I'm mistaken, I'd be interested in checking out the source you found that info on."
PhillyUnion,2orkdr,jpoRS,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:47:31 2014 UTC,Hoppenot too. Not that we should be building anything around him.   Anyone else think it's amusing that we're out-Frenching the Impact?
PhillyUnion,2orkdr,georgepordge,2,Tue Dec 9 18:53:14 2014 UTC,Maybe sending Jack Mac to Montreal was just an elaborate ruse to get him language training.

PhillyUnion,2onyy5,Dean_Moriarty,12,Mon Dec 8 17:58:49 2014 UTC,"Honestly, this isn't all THAT bad. Okugo was going to leave no matter what, so it's good we got some form of compensation for him. I hate to see him go but he was never going to stay.  Sapong came at the expense of a draft pick. We're not that great with those, so I think it's a fair exchange.  Let's not forget that Sapong was MLS rookie of the year a few years back. I've heard from SKC fans that he was often forced to play on the wing when he's much better up top. We have wingers in Le Toux and Wenger, so Sapong will most likely play up top as a backup to the striker we're ""searching Europe"" for."

PhillyUnion,2onyy5,LocksTheFox,4,Tue Dec 9 15:46:27 2014 UTC,I feel overall pretty good about this transfer. I love the athleticism of Sapong and his ability to work up front. He is stronger than Casey and more versatile.   I loved the spirit and natural talents of Amobi. One of those guys who is just a good guy to have on the field fighting for you. I feel like he was sad to lose Jack Mack and never felt in place with the team since then. Will not be booing him when he comes to town.
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,ScottKW87,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:13:46 2014 UTC,"I don't really follow SKC, but why was Sapong not as successful there?"
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,EdBacon,3,Mon Dec 8 22:21:19 2014 UTC,"Sapong is a target forward through and through. With the success of the likes of Mr. Selfie, Dom Dwyer, he lost his role as their go to guy. KC gave CJ shots as an outside winger, but he did not adapt well in terms of his Goal/Assist Production.   He has some serious hustle but not one with a deft touch. I think he fits Philly and hopefully we can use him to his strengths."

PhillyUnion,2onyy5,marksills,6,Mon Dec 8 18:48:23 2014 UTC,"According to this: http://www.mlsplayers.org/images/September%2015%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club%20(updated).pdf    Player 2014 Base Salary 2014 Guaranteed Compensation    Okugo $145,000 $224,000   Sapong $95,000 $112,000    We're saving a decent chunk of money letting Okugo go in addition to the ""over $100k in allocation money"" that's been reported for his rights."
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,-smokeandmirrors-,7,Mon Dec 8 18:58:13 2014 UTC,"Money isn't the issue. If we didn't trade him, Amobi would have went to Europe, and we would have gotten nothing. Money was never the issue."

PhillyUnion,2onyy5,-smokeandmirrors-,1 point,Mon Dec 8 19:10:22 2014 UTC,"Not only is money not the issue, but I'd like to think the Union should only be spending it... not friggen saving it."
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,btd39,3,Mon Dec 8 20:19:15 2014 UTC,Well it frees up money they can use. Probably would've been better had I worded it like that.
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,-smokeandmirrors-,3,Mon Dec 8 20:55:00 2014 UTC,"Not really. The cap is going up. The move wasn't about financial space.  We drafted Amobi, sat him on his ass for his first 2.5 years, played him in the wrong spot for the next 2 years, and then benched him again. We ruined his development. I can't say I wouldn't leave either."
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,FlapjackJackson,6,Mon Dec 8 19:03:37 2014 UTC,"yup, it kinda says a lot about our club that none of us are mad at amobi for leaving."
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,marksills,2,Mon Dec 8 19:06:27 2014 UTC,"This can't be our only move up top, can it? Sapong is in no way productive enough to play as a lone striker in a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1. Unless we're changing formations this is going to be a disappointing move."
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,EdBacon,9,Mon Dec 8 18:19:08 2014 UTC,"There's still the January transfer window too. And the team is apparently ""still looking in Europe"" for a striker according to Kevin Kinkead and he's been pretty on the nose with rumors."
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,-smokeandmirrors-,2,Mon Dec 8 18:25:55 2014 UTC,I'm so incredibly curious as to what rumors he heard about Hop and Wheeler lol.
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,btd39,2,Mon Dec 8 20:20:02 2014 UTC,"Rumor has it they're on the way out. Wheeler I felt still had upside as a forward, but I think we can close the book on Hop."

PhillyUnion,2onyy5,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:33:21 2014 UTC,I'm wondering if the Union look at him as that lone striker or if they just created a rotation of LeToux/Wenger/Sapong/Cruz/McLaughlin as wingers...
PhillyUnion,2onyy5,keystonemike,1 point,Mon Dec 8 19:52:03 2014 UTC,20 goals in 110 matches for SKC isn't very promising. Hope we can sign a proven goalscorer too.

PhillyUnion,2onyy5,TSands,8,Mon Dec 8 20:35:28 2014 UTC,"We played him out of position. Last season Harrisburg played him at CB, we played him at striker, and he us a CAM... How about we wait and see if he develops once he us given a chance to be successful."

PhillyUnion,2op336,xxtoejamfootballxx,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:07:18 2014 UTC,MacMath isn't to bad of a contract and with Hall's injury and age OCSC might be looking for a keeper that can start long term. They got Hall on the cheep and no one is sure how he will be coming off the injury.
PhillyUnion,2op336,TheDuckyNinja,0,Tue Dec 9 01:13:36 2014 UTC,"MacMath is coming off contract in 2015 and will certainly demand a good deal of money.  I still wouldn't be surprised if he went to Orlando, but he won't be a backup.  He's from there as well so it makes sense."
PhillyUnion,2op336,TheDuckyNinja,5,Tue Dec 9 01:24:54 2014 UTC,"Protecting Fabinho over Ribeiro is unforgivable.  And if M'Bolhi was so good that we had to bring him in and cause all this GK controversy, why is he not protected.  This team is frustrating."

I guess they felt that, since both expansion teams had MLS starters (the two keepers that started MLS Cup 2012, for what it's worth), neither OCSC or NYCFC will claim another keeper."
PhillyUnion,2op336,akuller,3,Tue Dec 9 01:56:17 2014 UTC,"That's bullshit logic.  If you spend a ton of time and effort bringing in a player, you don't then go ""well, if he gets taken, at least we still have the other guy"" or ""they probably won't take him"".

PhillyUnion,2om09s,leftyboy87,2,Mon Dec 8 03:51:28 2014 UTC,Kinkead says that the Union are adding a striker: https://twitter.com/KevinKCBS3/status/541770322681540608
PhillyUnion,2om09s,jpoRS,3,Mon Dec 8 03:53:29 2014 UTC,I've read it's CJ Sapong.
PhillyUnion,2om09s,RohnJossi,10,Mon Dec 8 04:14:22 2014 UTC,"Nope, Joe Hart."
PhillyUnion,2om09s,jpoRS,3,Mon Dec 8 04:58:48 2014 UTC,"Good for him. It seems like the Union just extended a qualifying offer so that they wouldn't draw as much blame when Amobi signs somewhere else. He'll be a part of a very solid core in Orlando, and I hope he enjoys much success."
PhillyUnion,2om09s,marksills,7,Mon Dec 8 03:55:25 2014 UTC,Well ... not too much success.
PhillyUnion,2om09s,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:59:10 2014 UTC,the fuck? does he not wanna play here or are we just not offering enough so we can pay 300k to mbolhi?
PhillyUnion,2om09s,-smokeandmirrors-,5,Mon Dec 8 04:23:28 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't blame him if he doesn't want to be here. The coaching has been a mess. He's been a stellar player, and didn't get enough starts, and the team's relationship with its fans has been rapidly deteriorating. Why wouldn't you want to go some place else?   I want him to stay, the fans want him to stay... But think about it it's understandable why he wouldn't want to stay. I wouldn't fault him for it at all. Our team has soured its relationship with key players and is pretty openly mismanaged."
PhillyUnion,2om09s,marksills,3,Mon Dec 8 14:51:58 2014 UTC,Rumor is a striker is inbound so it could go to paying whoever that may be.
PhillyUnion,2om09s,-smokeandmirrors-,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:30:22 2014 UTC,dont think the right way to go about that is getting rid of okugo. terribly run team
PhillyUnion,2om09s,xenoletum,2,Mon Dec 8 04:39:07 2014 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken his contract is going to expire so instead of trying to pay to keep him which they might not be able to do (if they want to sign a striker as well), they let someone else do that job while taking in a 100k that they wouldn't have other wise had.  That's how I understand it at least."
PhillyUnion,2om09s,marksills,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:48:02 2014 UTC,"They aren't getting rid of him.  Curtin and the team was making him an offer, and he decided to go to Orlando City.  In return Orlando in good faith is giving us 100k and a SuperDraft pick."
PhillyUnion,2om09s,LocksTheFox,1 point,Mon Dec 8 06:13:25 2014 UTC,he wants to go to Orlando city that badly? or are we just giving him a shitty offer?

PhillyUnion,2om09s,leftyboy87,11,Mon Dec 8 04:04:52 2014 UTC,Better than letting him walk for nothing.
PhillyUnion,2om09s,FlapjackJackson,-1,Mon Dec 8 04:18:40 2014 UTC,I'd rather him walk for nothing to Europe than go to a conference opponent.
PhillyUnion,2om09s,leftyboy87,2,Mon Dec 8 11:38:39 2014 UTC,"Why? Pragmatically, allocation money is far more useful than nothing."
PhillyUnion,2om09s,FlapjackJackson,0,Mon Dec 8 13:08:00 2014 UTC,"Yes, but does it outweigh the danger of strengthening an opponent? I'm not entirely sure that's worth it. If he walks for nothing to another MLS squad, obviously I'd rather have some allocation money over nothing, but it's a different equation."
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,LocksTheFox,3,Fri Dec 5 17:43:13 2014 UTC,"Seems odd as he is a CDM.  Unless we are gonna play with him and noguiera at cdm, with edu shifting back to CB. Totally possible given the okugo and valdes leaving situation.   Tough not to read into this as bad news with okugo, valdes, or edu.   76 rating in fifa though, so for the right price he'd likely be a great acquistion."
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,arkr,15,Fri Dec 5 17:52:55 2014 UTC,I love the fact that FIFA ratings are a language everyone understands to determine the overall skill of a player.
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,oestre24,8,Fri Dec 5 17:59:23 2014 UTC,I still use Football Manager stats as reference. Far more accurate.
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,FlapjackJackson,8,Fri Dec 5 18:27:22 2014 UTC,"This is my thought if Valdes stays, Okugo leaves, and this dude signs...     MBolhi  Williams - Valdes - Edu - Gaddis  Kvist - Nogueira  Le Toux - Maidana - Wenger  new striker    Kvist as #6, Nogueira as #8. Maidana as the #10. Seba and Wenger making runs up the wings, and a new proven striker.  That's just my thoughts shrugs"
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,arkr,1 point,Fri Dec 5 18:11:00 2014 UTC,Def a good line up. I'm pretty sure we are going to be replacing Valdes with white though. Sounds like we are more likely to keep okugo than valdes at this point.
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,jpoRS,3,Fri Dec 5 18:19:28 2014 UTC,"Who even knows about Valdes. The whole situation has been a massive clusterfuck.  FWIW, I might be the only person who hasn't lost hope on Austin Berry. I liked him a lot, then he had one bad game and vanished from the face of the earth.  Speaking of guys who disappeared, what the hell happened to Leo Fernandes?"
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,SlamFist,3,Fri Dec 5 18:24:39 2014 UTC,"I'm still hoping for Berry-White Center Back duo. Even if it's just for early USOC games, I don't want to live in a world where that doesn't happen."

PhillyUnion,2odq7z,arkr,3,Fri Dec 5 18:27:48 2014 UTC,"assuming ""he"" is Fernandes...I dunno, he had a couple good games early in the year. Then he started to suck especially bad haha"
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,rmeas,1 point,Fri Dec 5 18:29:55 2014 UTC,I have to agree with flapjack here. Leo may have his moments but overall I don't think he is quite good enough to be on the field.
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,-smokeandmirrors-,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:51:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I don't really rate him"
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,Dahorah,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:59:17 2014 UTC,"I like Austin as well, you have to wonder how bad that injury was if he never was able to win his spot back. Though he was competing against edu, okugo, valdes, and an in form white. I think Berry will be a solid squad rotation player, and if he can regain form, maybe even allow edu to push into the midfield.   Imagine a midfield of edu, maidana, kvist, and nog. Pair a brand new finisher with them and we may actually win some games!"
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,Dahorah,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:54:00 2014 UTC,This was my thinking as well. They are counting on Okugo leaving and Edu switching to CB.
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,beggarb,1 point,Fri Dec 5 19:38:32 2014 UTC,I like the way this looks. A lot.

I think once we get over this next ""hump"" (having a real Striker) then the wings will be exposed as our next biggest issues."
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,funkyquasar,2,Fri Dec 5 20:47:51 2014 UTC,It's Wenger's best position. IMHO this has everyone in their strongest positions outside of Gaddis
PhillyUnion,2odq7z,yung_swagged_out_mf,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:49:00 2014 UTC,"It is, but thats not saying much. It's the best position of a player with no position coming out of college who failed as a striker and some think would be best as a defender.  Anointing him as anything special for a couple games he played out wide is a mistake and we would be making the same mistake of trusting the honeymoon period as we have so often in the past."

I think it might be worth it to take a flyer on Bright Dike (even though he's coming off of a torn ACL, which sucks) and Mansally from RSL. Neither have salaries that are that high, and are both young enough. Both are upgrades over what we currently have. I'd take Dike over Wheeler and Hoppenot."

PhillyUnion,2nhk5l,arkr,2,Wed Nov 26 16:07:10 2014 UTC,"Players to Waive:   Fabio Alves (D) Antoine Hoppenot (F) Conor Casey (F) Corben Bone (M) Fred Da Silva (M) Brian Carroll (M)   Players to Consider at Re-Entry/Waiver:    Sal Zizzo (KC) Andy Gruenebaum (KC) (Insert Goalie Joke; Only if MacMath leaves) Alexander López (HOU) Marvell Wynne (COL) Nick LaBrocca (COL) Danny Mwanga (COL)    Players Out Of Contract That Should Be Approached   Aurelien Collin (KC...Not my favorite guy but we could use the depth and with rumours of Valdez and Okugo...) Omar Cummings (HOU) Andrew Driver (HOU) Lawrence Olum (KC)   Sorry if I mixed some stuff up tried to compile my list as accurately as possible in terms of declined, waived, released, and what not.  EDIT: Thanks /u/arkr"
PhillyUnion,2nhk5l,MrChips217,2,Wed Nov 26 18:15:07 2014 UTC,If Valdes and or Okugo leave I'd actually be happy with Berry and White at CB...though I'd want a third guy as cover in case of injury
PhillyUnion,2nhk5l,LocksTheFox,1 point,Sun Nov 30 05:42:26 2014 UTC,"from what I understand, We have offered BC a new contract but will waive his rights if he doesnt accept. I have a feeling it will be much lower than the previous one.  Aurelien has recieved an offer from KC, meaning they still hold his rights. We would have to trade for them if we want to approach him.   Edit: olum's rights are still held by KC too, IIRC. He plans to move abroad from the sound of it. As does collin if not returing to KC"
PhillyUnion,2nhk5l,LocksTheFox,1 point,Wed Nov 26 18:59:25 2014 UTC,"My Players To Waive:  Fabio bone casey (unless he will agree to a contract with a pretty huge paycut, then he'd be a great mentor for a young striker) BC (same as casey) Fred Cristian hernandez (might be homegrown, but hes been plauged by injury and poor form with HCI. Seems like a roster spot that may be better spent with a squad player)  questionable: hoppenot  wheeler  both have shown promise, but both have also had horrible stints. Tough to say whether or not they are worth keeping for depth.  Other teams waived players: Mwanga -- had his only real success here. Getting older but still could show some talent. Mabye a return to philly could spark him again. Cummings -- Speedy, good depth for the correct price LaBrocca-- Again, good depth for the correct price Wynne -- on a big paycut. I think he was 250K before. Dovale -- Showed a lot of promise with KC. Many of their supporters didn't like him being cut. I'd say he might be worth picking up Zizzo -- Journeyman who is ok, again he could be a solid pick up for depth"

PhillyUnion,2ngadn,MrChips217,6,Wed Nov 26 05:34:36 2014 UTC,"That's just a damn shame, really. Not the most shocking name on that list if you look at his most recent performances, but if you look at his journey from 2010 with his success in Philly, how he was illogically traded away for someone who underperformed, only for the man who traded him to be fired, it's just a shame. There are probably a bunch factors that contribute to his dip in performance at Colorado, but this league is evolving so quickly and it's amazing that players like himself struggle to evolve with it. Here's to him finding a team that will help him develop and resurface, because Philly of all places knows he's worth it."
PhillyUnion,2ngadn,AdFinemFidelis,3,Wed Nov 26 05:57:08 2014 UTC,His dip started in Philly. He was really bad at the end of his tenure. It ended up being a salary dump.
PhillyUnion,2ngadn,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Wed Nov 26 06:17:10 2014 UTC,"He was over-hyped from the start. He was never a strong force in the box and was easily taken off the ball. His only goals toward the end were from distance when given WAY too much room. Looking at his numbers since leaving, he's never really turned things around. I think he's one of the cases where a natural athlete excels at the college level but doesn't have the work ethic to make it as a professional."

PhillyUnion,2nc7r9,FlapjackJackson,5,Tue Nov 25 04:25:57 2014 UTC,Unless this move nets a high quality striker it is pointless. I like Valdes and would prefer he remain with the union but if he want to leave we have 2 CB that can fill his shoes with help from edu.

PhillyUnion,2nc7r9,LocksTheFox,1 point,Wed Nov 26 07:17:08 2014 UTC,That probably is the case but should that be a real issue with the new CBA and hopefully an increased in salary cap? salary cap should be at least 2x
PhillyUnion,2nc7r9,akuller,3,Wed Nov 26 14:05:50 2014 UTC,"It's a like-for-like trade. The only reason behind it I can really think of is financial: Torres probably requires a smaller paycheck.

PhillyUnion,2nc7r9,EdBacon,1 point,Tue Nov 25 23:43:31 2014 UTC,Valdes wants to leave plain and simple. It's hard to keep an unhappy player.

PhillyUnion,2na73p,marksills,2,Mon Nov 24 21:49:47 2014 UTC,He is out of position at striker he is more of a midfielder. He has the tools and the potential to be a good attacking or central midfielder.

He just didn't fill a need and I definitely think that's part of people's frustrations with the whole thing. (ie. MacMath was good enough, why did we need to bring in someone else?) I think we'd be in a similar position this year with or without M'Bolhi at any rate due to no fault of either keeper.  The backlash against the play against Chicago was a culmination of a number of things, part of it was a mistake by M'Bolhi, which happens from time to time with all keepers (and players in general) and part of frustration to another season down the drain with nothing to show for it and an FO that doesn't/didn't seem to give a shit imo."

PhillyUnion,2mtf2c,FlapjackJackson,0,Thu Nov 20 17:42:21 2014 UTC,"BWP spent half of his time in England avoiding prosecution so that would make it hard to score goals.

I would love it if he would come to Philly and score boat loads of goals. I just am not sure that he realistically can without watching him play."
PhillyUnion,2mtf2c,akuller,2,Thu Nov 20 20:58:19 2014 UTC,"given that many of his early years he barely got any minutes...    also, correction: 2 of the goals were in 9 games with Gent in the Belgian league, who own him right now (loaned to  Caen)  He's only 25 too"

PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,MrChips217,11,Wed Nov 19 00:16:07 2014 UTC,Okugo going to Europe (rumored Bundesliga) would be a positive step for his career. It could actually get him called up to the USMNT if he does well. I root for him and wish him well.
PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,bit99,5,Wed Nov 19 14:03:09 2014 UTC,If he can get first team minutes at any Bundesliga club I'd say he's almost guaranteed a start for the national team. It would be great to see a Union player making his name known in world football (as long as we get a decent transfer fee).
PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,SpaceOwl,3,Thu Nov 20 00:24:00 2014 UTC,It'd be nuts for him not to give it a shot if he's got respectable offers. I don't watch any Bundesliga but I'm sure even on the low end of the table it's a much higher level of competition than MLS.
PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,goatyhead,9,Wed Nov 19 18:25:31 2014 UTC,I think I'd rather have Okugo. He just seemed to have a stronger season.

PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,EdBacon,2,Wed Nov 19 04:37:59 2014 UTC,Fine with that. I do expect an encore from Okugo in the future. I hope he does well in Europe!
PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,arkr,2,Wed Nov 19 00:26:40 2014 UTC,"Not a big deal, we are overloaded at CDM anyhow. Honestly I'd rather have Mo for long term even if okugo has more upside. If mobi stays he would leave in 1 or 2 years (if he continues developing), Mo could retire with us if he stays in form.   Hopefully in ~8-12 years we can cheer on a late career Amobi"
PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,drewuke,12,Wed Nov 19 02:02:26 2014 UTC,It's a big deal in the sense that we can't let guys like Okugo leave for free if we want to be a financially well-run team.
PhillyUnion,2mpwyo,thanksbastards,2,Wed Nov 19 04:09:20 2014 UTC,"The problem is Okugo hasn't been a CDM since college.

PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,thelostdolphin,-2,Sat Nov 15 20:37:20 2014 UTC,"You mean, can 90% of this sub stop being whiny babies about an organization still in its infancy. It's seriously embarrassing and so pathetic compared with most sports fans who have been through 1000x more than the meager growing pains the Union are going through."
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,Mike81890,18,Thu Nov 13 02:21:08 2014 UTC,"It's only frustrating when the club explicitly states ""It's a statement year. We're not the new boys any more "" and then proceeds to deliver more of the same unconvincing mediocrity."
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,thelostdolphin,3,Thu Nov 13 03:52:12 2014 UTC,I'm not saying people shouldn't want more from the organization but whining anonymously in a tiny internet forum isn't exactly raging against the machine. Just gets tiresome and makes it  unenjoyable visiting here or participating.
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,rabidfrodo,7,Thu Nov 13 16:26:56 2014 UTC,"Growing pains are different when the person taking you through them constantly lies and changes stories. Any young team needs a leader to help guide it till an identity had been found. Other than our first manager we haven't had that. Being upset about no direction, which is where we were if you want to admit it or not, is the right thing to do."
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,TJunior1014,5,Thu Nov 13 04:18:29 2014 UTC,About time. Great move by the U...finally.
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,pefsu13,5,Thu Nov 13 02:07:05 2014 UTC,"Personally, I'm very excited for this. With him as a talent consultant/maybe something of a coach(?) and Albright handling the MLS-y side of things, I think we could start to find some diamonds in the rough. Or at least have an eye to players with upside and cheap enough contracts that they don't kill us."
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,-smokeandmirrors-,6,Thu Nov 13 02:08:33 2014 UTC,Now THIS is a major announcement.
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,rabidfrodo,3,Thu Nov 13 02:31:43 2014 UTC,"This is something that's needed. We now have someone who is clearly defined as managing the soccer side of this organization that isn't in their first job.   This team has people that have potential players and management, but their refusal to admit it would take time forces them to overturn management to make it look like something was happening. Having someone that will step up and drive a vision and mentor people is what's needed. Mulensteen has been in soccer for years he has been along side one of the best managers of all time.   Sak can no longer hide behind the veil that was this teams organization structure. We should get clear roles not saying interims signed a third keeper. This shows to me that the Union understand where the failings occurred in the past year which was assembling a balanced roster not just signing players at positions whether or not they'd actually play.   Curtin can grow into his role now knowing someone mute experienced than him is there to assist him. Chris Albright can only be helped by having someone with Mulensteen's connections."
PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,notnewton1,1 point,Thu Nov 13 04:28:11 2014 UTC,"So this is great and I'm really excited but I do have a question I was hoping someone would be able to answer.

PhillyUnion,2m4z5u,marksills,2,Fri Nov 14 17:11:14 2014 UTC,from the sounds of it bascially this: The union do whatever they need to do then bring it to him and he says good idea or bad idea etc...unless this is his interim to become the GM but idk the union do weird shit that makes no sense.

PhillyUnion,2m6znq,jpoRS,19,Thu Nov 13 16:53:53 2014 UTC,"As you mentioned, navy blue and gold are the colors George Washington chose for his Continental Army. Considering all of the historical symbolism embedded in various aspect of the team's crest and identity (13 stars=13 colonies, Franklin's snake from his Pennsylvania Gazette, Sons of Ben, etc), I feel as though our claim to the color is stronger than all the rest, so I can't imagine it going anywhere and don't think it should."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,thelostdolphin,4,Thu Nov 13 19:09:32 2014 UTC,It's a shame black kits are almost as crowded.
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,BSFC_is_relevant,9,Thu Nov 13 20:40:26 2014 UTC,"I think that we should keep the blue, but maybe use more of the city's flag colors also. try to get some more yellow instead of the gold?"
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,timofree,3,Thu Nov 13 17:06:49 2014 UTC,I'd support more yellow in the uniform as well.
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,TJunior1014,2,Thu Nov 13 17:30:44 2014 UTC,"""In football you're either red or blue but you can't be both."" Blue is always a popular color to wear and it wouldn't make sense to switch to any other since our color scheme is based off the colors of the city flag"
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,ronaldo119,-1,Thu Nov 13 17:04:54 2014 UTC,"Not really for the home kits. According to Wiki and everything I've read, it's based on the revolutionary war-era Continental Army uniform. The aways maybe, but they're more white than anything else."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,j42justin,2,Thu Nov 13 17:15:32 2014 UTC,"No, definitely not."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,spqr-king,2,Thu Nov 13 21:14:54 2014 UTC,The black steelie uniforms should become our home kit!
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,caughtintraffic,4,Fri Nov 14 02:51:57 2014 UTC,"""Philly doesn't have a defined uniform color scheme"" - That is not true.  All 5 years the U have existed they wore a primary jersey that is navy blue with a gold stripe down the middle of the chest.   If we are talking about teams that have a blue jersey for their PRIMARY jersey then we are one of four.  NYCFC, Revolution, and Impact being the other three.  NYCFC wear light blue and Impact wear royal blue... Our primary jersey is navy blue so that leaves just us and New England with teams in the Eastern Conf. who wear navy blue as the primary color on their primary jersey (Chicago doesn't count, their secondary jersey is navy blue but their primary is red).  So should we give up on blue... absolutely not.  Navy is the primary color of our logo and it would be stupid to change our colors after only 5 years (especially since they is historical significance behind it).    You are correct, we have better things to talk about."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,funkyquasar,1 point,Thu Nov 13 20:17:20 2014 UTC,"Philly the city, not the Union specifically. Eagles are green, Phillies are red, Flyers are orange, Sixers are ... white?

PhillyUnion,2m6znq,caughtintraffic,1 point,Fri Nov 14 22:13:51 2014 UTC,"I won't pretend to know the Sixers on any level, but I don't think I'm out of line saying the Phillies are red. Yes they have blue and white also, but the Eagles and Flyers have black and white in addition to their primary color and no one would take issue with defining the Flyers as orange or the Eagles and green."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,ScottKW87,2,Sat Nov 15 19:04:26 2014 UTC,"I know, but if we're comparing them, then I'd group the two teams together. Obviously certain colors play different roles, but that's the overall idea behind the color scheme since a lot of American history occurred in Philadelphia. The colors harken back to that."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,WJMorris3,2,Sat Nov 15 21:31:43 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I misunderstood what you were suggesting.  Very few cities have a unified color palate for their sports teams.  It would be nice, but I think all of the Philadelphia sports teams have strong identities with their current colors."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,Mike81890,0,Fri Nov 14 15:13:39 2014 UTC,"hell a green kit could even cash in on some Eagles cross-promotion.   I love that idea. Other teams in the league have had some cross-over between major leagues. I think for a city like Philly that has a long history with 4 major sports, showing them some love would help to build up the club."
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,thelostdolphin,0,Fri Nov 14 16:58:37 2014 UTC,Why not go radical and make a gold uniform as our primary?
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,SirMothy,3,Thu Nov 13 18:02:40 2014 UTC,We already tried that.
PhillyUnion,2m6znq,Gabs00,0,Thu Nov 13 18:09:08 2014 UTC,That was a secondary. And it was awful

What I do know is we can't leave any of these unprotected in the draft.  I believe Blake is automatically protected.  I am pretty sure MacMath would need protection.  I am unsure about M'Bolhi.  Either way, I believe all 3 have more value than being left unprotected in the expansion draft.  We should be able to trade 1 keeper to an expansion team for ""Don't pick one of our players in the draft"" AND something else on top of it.  I don't think there are 11 players on our team who have such value."

PhillyUnion,2ll65h,Keepa1,13,Fri Nov 7 16:01:21 2014 UTC,Insanity. You're thinking of insanity; doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Though what's that say about us fans...

PhillyUnion,2ll65h,emptythecache,4,Fri Nov 7 16:41:17 2014 UTC,Rinse and repeat.
PhillyUnion,2ll65h,EdBacon,4,Fri Nov 7 16:07:03 2014 UTC,"Wow, attitudes have changed. I personally do like Curtin, and particularly the way he carries himself. I would just like to see the scouting improve, because I feel that Curtin knows what to do with the guys he has, and our late season collapse was more due to a lack of depth than anything tactical."
PhillyUnion,2ll65h,emptythecache,8,Fri Nov 7 16:33:30 2014 UTC,"It was demonstrated pretty clearly that he's incapable of adapting his tactics on a game-by-game basis. Once everyone saw how Curtin was setting the team up they were able to effectively counter his strategy, and we had no answer.   We need somebody that is tactically flexible and able to prepare the team to face opponents using more than one strategy over and over.   I don't have a problem with Curtin as an individual, and I think he can fill a role on the coaching staff, but he's not a tactician or a head coach."
PhillyUnion,2ll65h,EdBacon,2,Fri Nov 7 17:06:45 2014 UTC,"My question is this: What other strategy could he employed with the roster he had? We basically have a best 11 with one play style, and 3-4 subs that can replace like for like. We don't really have any impact subs that change the tempo or style of play. I still think it comes down to a lack of depth / flexibility built into our roster."
PhillyUnion,2ll65h,emptythecache,2,Fri Nov 7 17:50:25 2014 UTC,I don't know. I'm not the one that can answer that. My concern is that this is the exact same excuse people gave Hackworth in 2013: that we couldn't do anything better with the roster we had.
PhillyUnion,2ll65h,EdBacon,2,Fri Nov 7 17:55:59 2014 UTC,"By that point, Hackworth had had a couple offseasons to retool his lineup. Obviously there were a few constraints left in place from the Nowak era, but he had had the opportunity to build his team. Curtin has not yet. The summer window was open right when he was named interim manager, I can't imagine he had any real clout to make moves during that time."

PhillyUnion,2ll65h,Mike81890,2,Fri Nov 7 17:10:58 2014 UTC,"Curtin is an excellent sound byte guy. I think he's going to do great next season, just as long as the fans don't turn on him after one loss, which let's face it, will happen anyway."
PhillyUnion,2ll65h,emptythecache,2,Fri Nov 7 18:03:12 2014 UTC,They've turned on him already. If you look at last season he wasn't THAT impressive. Couple that with the hype-crash of getting Mulenstein when Curtin was announced and he was handed an impossible job.

PhillyUnion,2ll65h,KFCConspiracy,2,Fri Nov 7 18:26:24 2014 UTC,"A lot of ire could have been avoided if he'd said nothing or little instead of talking about this grand expedition to scour the four corners of the planet to find just the right manager.   As far as the actual appointment of Curtin. It seems ""former player"" is one of the more successful molds for MLS coaches. Fine, I can deal with that. But it sure feels like a slap in the face to the fans if you only look at the public comments about the search versus what actually happened.  I'm still holding out hope that there will be more staff added. I don't think there are enough bodies there to run this club properly.  edit:removed excessive grumpiness"

PhillyUnion,2l9v3v,goatyhead,4,Tue Nov 4 21:11:08 2014 UTC,"Here's the deal. Look what RSL just did. They fielded a USL side, but will have them playing at Rio Tinto, that way, no investment in finding a new location. The Union actually have a couple of options here.   They could have Union2 for the sake of naming them play at PPL. Location problem solved. If they didn't care about revenue (which we all know they do), they could setup bleachers on the new practice fields and have the team play there.   Utilizing PPL isn't a bad idea though. A lot of people used to show up for the reserve side matches, and I know if and when I could, I'd be showing up to USL matches.  The Union, along with YSC and other youth players, probably have more than enough players to fill a team. I could see it happening much sooner than later. Sak is not a fan of Harrisburg, mainly because of their Stadium/facilities issues."

PhillyUnion,2l9v3v,goatyhead,3,Wed Nov 5 14:13:42 2014 UTC,"Well, we can sign more young players to play for the team. Look at LA. They just signed a 15 year old keeper who can now play USL football. LA would have likely waited several years and his development would be hurt by sticking with youth teams and high school soccer. The same goes with our academy players. We can sign several teenagers and give them professional minutes to develop and prepare for MLS.  Further, we can control their development. At one point, Harrisburg was playing Ribeiro as a centerback. That's a problem with loaning a player out to a third party."

PhillyUnion,2l6twn,hoax021,0,Tue Nov 4 00:27:17 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how much he's paid, but that would certainly be a good reason to not protect him.  I thought he improved his ball control a lot this year. He also fell down a lot less than usual. Obviously not a top wing in the league, but his athleticism and work ethic are huge positives."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,_asper,4,Tue Nov 4 00:33:25 2014 UTC,"Danny Cruz is making $125,000.  Absolutely not worth protecting and should be cut in my opinion if he isn't taken.  We can get MUCH better value on the free market.  The reason our depth is so bad is because we have so many irrationally bloated contracts.    Cruz- $125,000  Carroll - $185,220  Lahoud - $99,000  Casey - $192,500  With those players off the books (other than maybe Lahoud) we can invest that money/cap space much better."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,xxtoejamfootballxx,-1,Tue Nov 4 03:05:02 2014 UTC,"What better value? What player will we get that is better depth than Cruz and cheaper? Who is this mystery player? Also, are you forgetting that the cap will significantly increase which makes Cruz's salary smaller in comparison?  Part of the problem with this team is we consistently purge the roster, especially depth players. How do you expect to have depth to keep players fresh down the stretch while cutting everyone on the bench? Cruz is a decent player who provides a spark off the bench. We need to be adding more of these players, not less."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,FlapjackJackson,7,Tue Nov 4 15:31:03 2014 UTC,"Cruz is a decent player who provides a spark off the bench.    No he isn't.  Every time Cruz enters the match he completely destroys momentum.  If you can't see this you are blind.  Wenger is probably our most effective offensive player at creating chances and Cruz is probably our least effective. He cannot control the ball, takes it to the endline and fucks up 95% of the time.    I'd rather see a young player fill in that role and develop than have Cruz flailing around.  Over the past 2 seasons he has averaged a goal every 590 minutes (6.6 games) and an assist every 885 minutes (9.8 games).  That is horrendous for his position, especially considering he is supposed to provide a ""spark"".    Wenger averaged a goal every 372 minutes (4.1 games) and an assist every 425 minutes (4.7 games).  And this is including his 2013 year when he was universally declared a bust.   Want some players that have a lower base salary than Cruz?  -Will Bruin  -Quincy Amarikwa  -Justin Meram  -Harry Shipp  -Luke Moore  -Andres Romero  -Dillon Powers  -Kelyn Rowe  -Teal Bunbury  -Shea Salinas  -Ethan Finlay  -Gonzalo Pineda  -Luke Mulholland  -Michel  All significantly better than Cruz.  Stop acting like it's impossible to find any quality players for $120,000"
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,xxtoejamfootballxx,-1,Tue Nov 4 16:04:17 2014 UTC,"Shipp, Powers, and Rowe are on rookie contracts which is misleading. We aren't getting any of them or most of the other players on this list, so I don't know why you listed them. You seriously think teams will trade away Bruin, Amarikwa, Shipp, Powers, Rowe, Bunberry, Salinas, Finlay, Pineda, or Mulholland? Again, who is actually available, not some stupid pipe dream to use to justify your hate crusade against Cruz?  You want a team who can compete, but you don't want depth players. This isn't FIFA. You need people who can come off the bench and rotate in. Cruz is one of the only players on this team capable of it. Blowing up this team every single season hasn't worked for the first 5 seasons, and it certainly won't work now. Pay attention to soccer in this league. We don't have the luxury of having a player like Dzeko come off the bench because this is MLS. We need to build around what we have, not gut this team constantly. You are asking for us to become the new Toronto."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,FlapjackJackson,7,Tue Nov 4 16:17:03 2014 UTC,"You want a team who can compete, but you don't want depth players.    CRUZ IS A FUCKING TERRIBLE DEPTH PLAYER.  I don't get why you can't see this.  If these other teams are able to gets players on these contracts, then SO CAN WE.  We can draft someone to replace him, or sign a free agent. It's not that hard to see.  With the CBA going up we will have even more room to get better depth players that are WAY better than Cruz.  Hell, we have players we need to develop that have infinitely more potential than Cruz and can do just as well off the bench.  The point I'm making is that he's taking up a shit ton of space and providing the skill level of someone making half his salary.  We can easily get someone as good as Cruz.  He sucks.      Pay attention to soccer in this league. We don't have the luxury of having a player like Dzeko come off the bench because this is MLS.   When we played in the USOC Final, Seattle brought Martins, Pappa, and Pineda off the bench, while we brought in Cruz, Fred and Ribeiro.  That was the difference in that game.    In recent playoff games, the Revs have brought on Patrick Mullins, The Red Bulls brought on Tim Cahill and Luyindula, DCU brought on Chris Rolfe, Seattle brought on Kenny Cooper, LAG brought on Alan Gordon, the Whitecaps brought on Darron Mattocks, Kekuta Manneh, and Dallas brought on Adres Escobar.  Every single one of those subs is significantly better than Danny Cruz, who has played in 58 games for us over the past 2 seasons.     Blowing up this team every single season hasn't worked for the first 5 seasons, and it certainly won't work now.   So unloading Cruz, Carroll, Lahoud and Casey is blowing up the team?  That makes absolutely no sense.  Lahoud and Carroll got basically no time when we were successful and neither fit into our team at all.    Casey is beyond past his prime and can't even play 60 minutes effectively.  There is no way he's worth what we pay him.  No way in hell he should be starting for us next season.  And then that brings us to Danny Cruz.  A terrible sub that scores a goal every 7 complete games and has an assist every 10 complete games in a position that is designed to generate assists and some goals.  Tell me again how that's blowing up the team?  In theory with them gone (and Oguko jumping ship) you still have this lineup:  -------------Striker--------------  Wenger----------------Le Toux  ---------------Chaco--------------  --------Noggy----Edu------------  Gaddis-Valdes-White-Williams  ------------M'Bolhi----------------  The biggest problem with our team is that our depth players are terrible.  Holding onto them for the sake of not ""blowing up the team"", especially when they are extremely overpaid, is absurd."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,xxtoejamfootballxx,4,Tue Nov 4 17:16:24 2014 UTC,i like you...you're smart.
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,hoax021,3,Tue Nov 4 20:38:54 2014 UTC,"You don't have to trade for those exact guys, rather they are good examples of what alternatives may be/are out there.   My preference, by far, is to work in McLaughlin. He's done good work at Harrisburg and shows a lot more technical skill. I appreciate Cruz's work ethic, and he genuinely seems like a good human being. However that doesn't change the fact that with the league improving steadily his skill set of hard work and occasional diving is not sufficient."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,goatyhead,1 point,Tue Nov 4 17:41:15 2014 UTC,It doesn't have to be either or. You can play both Jimmy and Danny. We need more depth which means playing more players.
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,FlapjackJackson,-1,Tue Nov 4 17:49:01 2014 UTC,"Paid too much? He is paid a fairly small amount all things considered. Further, you do know the salary cap is going to increase significantly which will make Cruz's contract have even less of an impact.  Also, I don't think you watch this team or league if you think he is terrible. He is a rotational player that improved a lot since arriving at this team. He isn't meant to be Messi. He is meant to be able to provide a spark off the bench for this team and spot start when needed. Danny does both well."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,FlapjackJackson,3,Tue Nov 4 15:33:13 2014 UTC,god i hate the way you talk..like your better than everyone else mr. zolo talk. if the cap goes up...cruz's salary goes up with it so its no different. also bringing on cruz for a spark really isn't that great. he has little to no skill and is very sloppy and falls down. if you think paying him what we play him to be a bench player is worth it then well im glad you just write a dumb blog rather than work for the union :D
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,hoax021,0,Tue Nov 4 20:35:06 2014 UTC,"I, too, am happy I don't work for such a frustrating team as the Union.  Cruz's salary only goes up if we give him a new contract. The point remains that we need depth. You don't build depth by jettisoning everyone on the team that doesn't reach a high level of expectations every single year. That's how we needed up getting rid of Jacobson, Mapp, and Salinas, all of whom ended up being big players for their teams. It's incredibly unrealistic to assume we should be paying everyone tiny wages.  As far as Cruz himself, he is a grinder who is a good player to throw on while winning in order to run at tired defenders and tackle them hard. He had a purpose which many people tend to ignore."
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,FlapjackJackson,3,Tue Nov 4 20:40:39 2014 UTC,but...how often are we winning late? not often. and even if we are it clearly hasn't been working. he sucks just admit it.
PhillyUnion,2l6twn,hoax021,1 point,Tue Nov 4 22:32:38 2014 UTC,That may be the case but I think that's because of how terrible the depth is. The best of the worst really isn't that good after all.

At least you didn't even answer the question.  But my answer, San Jose at home, because I think their team is kick ass and we could win against them.

But to answer I like OP's original 2 to start but then have it be we kick the Pink Bulls in Red Bull Arena just to see if we can beat 2 new york teams in 2 new york arenas.  Then hit New England at home then swing out west preferably for anyone not named the Galaxy, I mean we have an ok record against west coast but absolutely tepid against LA.

PhillyUnion,2kvin0,xxtoejamfootballxx,-1,Fri Oct 31 18:57:57 2014 UTC,I used to think the Union needed to keep 2 of Edu/Nogs/Okugo but Edu's salary I think is still an issue. Do you invest that kind of money in that part of the field in MLS?  I don't know.
PhillyUnion,2kvin0,beggarb,2,Fri Oct 31 19:12:37 2014 UTC,"With the new CBA in the off season I say yes.  Edu one of the best players at his position in the league, is a freak athlete and doesn't take up an international roster spot.  He's worth what we are paying him and other players salaries will just go up, not to mention the DP threshold rising to an unknown amount."

PhillyUnion,2kvin0,avsman,1 point,Fri Oct 31 13:14:19 2014 UTC,There's no doubt he's one of the better players on the team. The much more interesting version of the question is a two parter:  1) Is he worth what we pay him? 2) What position does he play?

It's sort of odd, I feel like Edu is a better CDM and CB than Okugo, but Nogueira is the most important player on the team in my opinion. Okugo-Nogueira paired much better together than Edu-Nogueira did.  Maybe part of the issue is Edu sees himself as a CM when he should be more committed to the CDM role."

I'm fairly certain he could play in any of the major leagues second divisions( Bundesliga 2, English Championship, Spanish Liga Adelante). He could also quite possibly play on a lower French Ligue 1 side, Ligue 2  or any of the top divisions in the smaller countries like Sweden, Norway, Belgium or Portugal.

PhillyUnion,2koe2l,emptythecache,3,Wed Oct 29 16:15:34 2014 UTC,"To be honest, if Mo doesn't stay on the backline, I'd still rather see Okugo at DM. I feel like he does a better job shielding the back four, particularly in recovery. I'm so fucking sick of seeing Edu jog behind the play after getting beat.  edit: Also, 5 years is too soon to run out of originals. The Union is a young team, with lots of pieces of history still to write. For me, having an inaugural roster member retire in a Union shirt in a decade would be fucking awesome. I look forward to names being inextricably tied to the union. The FO has a gross habit of shipping out faces of the franchise, we need our Logan Pause, our Jaime Moreno, our Landon Donovan."

We spent a good amount of money on a 3rd keeper when it should have been spent on a striker.   Cruz has been good off the bench I will give you that. But he's limited on both sides but his energy is why he's still here.   In my opinion we need to get rid of Carroll is the keystone problem. If we get rid of Carroll we can slide Edu and Amobi as our two CM's. Valdez, Berry, and White can get more playing time at CB.   Also another issue is have two really good young RB's. Maybe trading one and getting a LB or just using Williams at CB and Gaddis on the right or even Gaddis at LB and Williams on at RB. Which was done for some games in the past."

PhillyUnion,2km0g7,hoax021,3,Tue Oct 28 22:47:28 2014 UTC,You name someone we should protect over him. He is a good option of the bench for a team that wants to actually compete in this league. If we truly want to be a competitive team we need players who are good off the bench. Look at Seattle they bring players who have similar issues to Cruz off the bench in games abd roles that let them excel.

He is bad and paid a ton of money, I doubt he'll be on the team next season even if he isn't taken in the draft.  Better than him?  Berry is much better and has trade value.  Lahoud is certainly more valuable as he can play multiple positions and is a pretty good defender.  Also, are Brown and Edu available in this?"
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,xxtoejamfootballxx,1 point,Wed Oct 29 01:14:56 2014 UTC,i think he means winger not winner but there are tons of wingers i'd rather take over cruz who probably are better than him and make less money. Cruz works hard because he sucks and it's all he can do.

PhillyUnion,2km0g7,goatyhead,1 point,Wed Oct 29 20:38:01 2014 UTC,"I funny believe Brown or Edu are available or they would matter due to their positions and loan reasons. Also I never said Cruz was a winner just we need depth if we ever want to win. Berry is good but we pay him much more and trade bait maybe before we didn't have him in the 18 for the entire second half of the season. As for Lahoud, he can play one position well and the others only if we have no other option. We don't have depth out wide we do at CB and CM currently."
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,rabidfrodo,1 point,Wed Oct 29 01:44:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah but if we go cut Cruz we can use that money to actually go sign someone good.  With the new CBA we're likely to drop even more money.    From my understanding Brown and Edu are available because the draft ends before their loans are up.  Basically people would be drafting their right of first refusal.  AKA we should probably protect both of them haha   Edit:  Just realized you meant to saw ""winger"" but instead wrote ""winner"".  That was really what bothered me.  That said, I think Williams would be a better winger than Cruz if we could sign a left back and move Gaddis to the right."
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,xxtoejamfootballxx,1 point,Wed Oct 29 02:05:25 2014 UTC,Protecting Brown would be dumb. No one is going to take him. Edu maybe but I think people wouldn't take him because he can go back to England then choose where to sign.
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,rabidfrodo,1 point,Wed Oct 29 02:45:59 2014 UTC,"because he can go back to England then choose where to sign.    No, because if he came back to the US his rights would be owned by whoever drafted him and he'd have to go there or nowhere."

PhillyUnion,2km0g7,drewuke,3,Tue Oct 28 22:35:07 2014 UTC,"Seeing as Okugo is out of contract, will he need to be protected?"
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,LocksTheFox,3,Tue Oct 28 22:44:39 2014 UTC,"Yup. He might not come back next year, but we would still hold his rights. If we don't protect him, then NYCFC or OCSC would surely draft his rights and possibly him if he signed a contract then from them."
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,drewuke,1 point,Tue Oct 28 22:47:09 2014 UTC,Couldn't he just not sign a contract for them and sign back with us? I'm not sure how that would work.

PhillyUnion,2km0g7,rabidfrodo,2,Tue Oct 28 22:52:41 2014 UTC,Not pointless if we want to sign him.
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,drewuke,2,Tue Oct 28 22:56:54 2014 UTC,It won't help us to protect him. A loaned player can't be protected. By the time of the draft he won't be an MLS player.
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,rabidfrodo,2,Tue Oct 28 23:03:19 2014 UTC,"Except a loaned player can and has been protected. Roger Torres was protected twice while still on loan in 2010 and 2011. As for Edu, it totally depends when his loan ends, which is probably December 31st and the expansion draft is December 10th.  EDIT: Loan might go to June which means protection would be obvious."
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,drewuke,2,Tue Oct 28 23:06:22 2014 UTC,I'll give you that though we can't be sure. Also lets say Orlando takes him he doesn't sign with them and his loan ends? Are we any worse off?
PhillyUnion,2km0g7,rabidfrodo,3,Tue Oct 28 23:30:31 2014 UTC,"Well we lose his rights for nothing, so yes."

PhillyUnion,2keo37,JrtheWriter,21,Sun Oct 26 22:14:57 2014 UTC,Anyone else find it funny that in virtually the only minutes he played this year Pfeffer scored? Oh and he recently scored for the youth national team against Argentina. But nope he isn't even good enough to make the Union bench.

PhillyUnion,2kenxq,xenoletum,3,Mon Oct 27 00:12:58 2014 UTC,Yeah people need to understand he's not just an employee. So unless you guys want to find someone to buy out his share we gotta hope he can learn to relate to the fans better.
PhillyUnion,2kenxq,goatyhead,2,Mon Oct 27 12:56:06 2014 UTC,He's a minority owner.  They can easily remove him from his position of CEO.

We focus heavily on families, and have terrible quality media.  The only somewhat professional looking commercial I've every seen for the Union was one of the Farfans playing soccer inside with a bunch of kids that gets broken up by a mom.    They also generally don't advertise enough.  And when they do it's not creative at all.  I would love to know what agency they use, if any.  They literally have one of the most passionate sports cities in the world and they don't tap into the potential at all.   They never do anything like these:  http://adage.com/article/behind-the-work/wexley-hits-nerve-seattle-sounders-soccer/136031/  http://www.sjearthquakes.com/news/2014/08/quakes-expand-milestoepicenter-campaign-billboards-around-globe  http://www.fastcompany.com/3026949/marketing-with-a-kick-portland-timbers  http://www.campaignbrief.com/2014/02/new-york-city-football-club-la.html  https://twitter.com/NYCFC/status/492336892495814656  http://www.thestar.com/sports/tfc/2014/01/15/toronto_fc_airs_new_jermain_defoe_ads_trumpeting_tottenham_striker_leaving_epl.html  It's honestly embarrassing how terrible our marketing is compared to some other teams in MLS."

That was a PR nightmare waiting to happen.  But this thread is a good indication that they'll be forced to change if they don't want their wallets hit.  Hopefully they realize before it's too late.  Sak is known for being able to bring in sponsorship dollars (see Bimbo, PPL, Chik-Fil-A).  That's what won him executive of the year or whatever he was twice.  The problem is he doesn't really understand customer lifetime value and his teams have folded and been sold to a soda company immediately after his involvement.  He has never created a successful brand in his entire life and it's worrisome."

PhillyUnion,2kenxq,m4nu,2,Mon Oct 27 11:55:31 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean to re-up this year. I was on the fence last year. I was on the fence this year. By a miscommunication between my season ticket compatriot and myself we are coming back next year.   I wasn't going to re-up because of the lack of commitment by the FO. It was nice last year that we got Maidana and Nogueira and I have to give credit. Both of those players are definite +MLS players and are great additions to the team at respectable prices. Apart from those two guys it just doesn't seem like the FO cares about the on the field product at all.  I did a big angry write-up in another thread that boils down to the people who buy tickets being seen as customers, not fans. Sak and co don't really care if we win or lose. It'd be nice if we won, but the cost outweighs the benefit. We'll never be relegated, we're not in Chivas-realm attendance so don't splurge on costs, increase infrastructure, and keep taking money.   Keep in mind, this might not be the wrong way of running a team. Franchises like this move at glacier speed and our ownership really doesn't have a lot of flex-cash. It takes forever to do anything so maybe Sak is the guy to take the blame while we actually solidify ourselves as a part of the Philly and American sport landscape.   I'm not saying it's not horrifically frustrating and I'm not saying I was going to buy season tickets next year, but maybe we need to accept that Sak isn't leaving and he may actually be doing good for our organization (training facility, trying to do something with an academy, etc)."
PhillyUnion,2kenxq,Mike81890,2,Mon Oct 27 13:18:37 2014 UTC,"Section 113.  We stopped wanting to go to the games.  It's an hour drive, sometimes hour and a half, to the game then another hour and a half back.   Pretty much an entire day turned into going to a Union game.  Half the games we attended made us go home unhappy when the Union did something ludicrously stupid at the end of the game.    Didn't have fun.  Wasted the entire day.  Can find better things to do.  I don't feel like the team will be any more enjoyable to watch in the near future.  For every player like Nogueira, who is awesome and who I love watching, there are five others who make me scratch my head.  I understand that not every player will work out and that chances need to be taken.  I don't understand how most of the signing and decisions would work in a best case scenario."
PhillyUnion,2kenxq,MortalSmurph,2,Mon Oct 27 20:10:05 2014 UTC,"Founding member, season ticket holder to this day.  I think you need to remember the club is still in it's infancy.  Yes, it's frustrating seeing (every single) horrible move the front office makes but you MUST support this club financially to give the sport a strong foothold in this city.  This is about the sport growing, and kids seeing that there is an avenue to pursue soccer as a lifelong goal, not just something you play in high school and maybe college.    Think about the big picture, not just some knee jerk reaction."

If we are ever going to get people to step up and take notice to Soccer in Philadelphia, we need to continue to be supportive of the team. The ticketed numbers are nice and having the 30k+ in attendance for the first home game ever was nice, but we need to at least try to get some of the city on board with the idea of soccer.  We've got all these youth leagues participating and I remember hearing that Chester's soccer playing population now outranks that of its Basketball playing population.  With the two new training fields opening, and if the Union management allow public access to those grounds on non training hours, it'll only help that area more.

The Philly area has and always will be a strong area for youth soccer.    Supporting a loser franchise with a conman like Nick in charge is a waste of time and money. Until the front office gets serious about competing and following through on their promises it's simply put not worth the $$ or the time to go watch them play to a 10-12-12 record every year."

Love of the sport trumps love of the franchise, the franchise helps the sport grow and presents an opportunity for promising players from this area to further develop their careers.

Going to the games are supposed to be a fun, enjoyable night out.  The parking situation is so bad there that we just didn't feel like dealing with it anymore.  We've let them know time and again that we'll come back if they ever fix it so that you can leave after the whistle and not get stuck in traffic for at least a half hour and if they can provide properly paved parking lots.

PhillyUnion,2k3i1k,EdBacon,2,Thu Oct 23 20:01:38 2014 UTC,Can we sign some hobbits to save us? It should only take a few.
PhillyUnion,2k3i1k,goatyhead,1 point,Fri Oct 24 18:51:20 2014 UTC,That is a dark and desolate view.
PhillyUnion,2k3i1k,DoubleHappyDave,2,Thu Oct 23 20:10:16 2014 UTC,"Hmmm,  I don't think you need to protect White or Berry as long as Edu agree's to come back at CB with Valdes.  Either guy off the bench is great.  The same is true with Fabinho, Casey and Cruz.  Good skill sets off the bench.  Now I am going to say something that everyone will hate me for.  Don't protect La Toux.  Yea he is one of my favorite guys, and my son has met him a couple times and Seba could not have been nicer.  But he is getting older, I don't think NYCFC will take him, I doubt Orlando will and I suspect if he goes we would move Wenger to the right wing and get a more natural guy on the left.  I don't think we need ""depth at striker"".  We need a striker, guys like Casey and Brown off the bench can provide depth to an actual striker.  Otherwise I agree with your assessment.  I don't think you can keep Blake and M'Boli because they both pull international duty at the same time."
PhillyUnion,2k3i1k,spqr-king,1 point,Thu Oct 23 14:42:41 2014 UTC,"Considering M'Bolhi will be gone on international duty regularly it might give Blake time to settle in a second keeper or Macmath for that matter. I do not like M'Bolhi and the Algerian invasion on the Facebook page has made his time here just that more annoying to say the least but they won't get rid of him. Perhaps after he adjusts to MLS scheduling he will play better. I Also totally agree at striker Casey is slow, big, and typical of the old US soccer mentality that bigger is better. We need someone who can score to keep our team off the attack all the time. Finally I think we need a leadership change I like Edu he is a good player but I think we need a quality experienced player who can pull the team together on the field to prevent come from behind blowouts like we have been seeing. I would like to see Pfeffer get some time on the field as well our homegrown players won't improve without playtime."

PhillyUnion,2k1og7,thelostdolphin,8,Wed Oct 22 23:57:43 2014 UTC,"This may be controversial: But I want him to stay. Hear me out on this.   I don't think he should have much involvement in player/personnel decisions beyond being a guy with a huge soccer rollodex. Let's face it, he has great contacts, friends in advantageous places and that helps us make deals in and out of the league. That means I think he should hire a general manager, preferably someone with experience at a large team, player development, and farming players. The obvious may be Rene Meulensteen.   I also think he needs to bring in a new coach, now whether that's up to the general manager, or not, I don't care. Just not Jim Curtin. I like the guy, he has a good report with the players, but his strategy is lacking... So he needs to work under an experienced coach and with a general manager over every one.   Also Sak is one of the money bags behind the Union, along with Sugarman. He seems to be pretty savvy when it comes to the investment and business part. That's what he needs to focus on. He's the operating partner in the company, so he'd be difficult to actually get rid of anyway.   One thing is clear here though, something has to change, and myself being a realist, I realize that Sak himself is probably not going anywhere any time soon. In spite of his many short comings, he has done some good for our team, and in the team's business structure, it just isn't in the cards. The guy's poisoned the locker room dynamics, hurt player morale, and set the stage for us to lose some key people either during expansion draft, wanting to be traded, or during contract negotiation.    I also think the front office has a big PR problem in how they talk to the fans... Their statements around tifogate and other controversies have consistently thrown fuel onto every fire. And perhaps the buck stops with Sak on that one, but I don't know. But the messaging is wrong, and they make misstep after misstep in handling passionate, straight talking Philly fans. That means Nick has to quit getting front of microphones and shut up, and it means that the messaging around game results, acquisitions, and controversies need to change... Rather than double down on everything and deny there's a problem they need to be more open with fans and extend the olive branch.   And before you downvote (This or any other post): The point of reddit is discussion, the point of a downvote is to hide and push to the bottom non-constructive discussion. If you disagree with me, great, I'll upvote you for it because discussion is great. I don't particularly care about the karma, but rather the hiding part."
PhillyUnion,2k1og7,KFCConspiracy,2,Thu Oct 23 14:41:43 2014 UTC,Great points. I'm in full support of a GM as well. Obviously Meulensteen would be ideal. Player development and recruiting is where is greatest strengths lie.   I'm not convinced that Curtin needs to go though. Just having an experienced GM would help provide enough guidance (IMO) to build upon the tremendous success Jim saw as interim manager this season before the last couple weeks of mediocrity.
PhillyUnion,2k1og7,KFCConspiracy,3,Thu Oct 23 14:57:17 2014 UTC,"I don't want to see him outright gone, I just don't want to see him as manager... I think his success this season has been mostly due to doing the obvious things, and where he's struggled has been in managing the non-obvious situations.   The obvious things he did well was stabilizing the starting XI, playing people in their position, and not having the midfielders switch sides every 5 minutes (Alla Hackworth).   It's possible that because of his roster situation he wasn't able to make the most of things, and we may be able to partially attribute his late-season falloff to that, but I'm not convinced that explains everything."
PhillyUnion,2k1og7,ultimatewaste20,2,Thu Oct 23 15:15:18 2014 UTC,"I really believe that Hackworth screwed the pooch with this roster despite bringing in some higher quality players. When I say he screwed the pooch, I mean he brought in players and expected them to play positions that they ended up not being their best in.   Maidana was originally played on the left wing, turns out he was a much better CAM than winger.   Nogueria was brought in to be the CAM, but is better as a #8/Play from the back midfielder.   Edu was brought in to be a DM, and ended up playing a lot of CB (granted some of that was due to injuries.   Brings in White and buries him on the depth chart only for him to have a relatively solid second half of the season and Berry never played again after his injury.   This also put us in a situation where Okugo played no CB, because we had good depth there and was forced to the bench when Nogs and Edu played DM.   And of course the drafting of Blake which contributed to logjam at GK.  TL:DR-Clusterfucks everywhere"
PhillyUnion,2k1og7,EdBacon,1 point,Thu Oct 23 18:43:13 2014 UTC,"I think the roster played a huge role in things. I always think too, if I'm in my arm chair at home saying ""this"" should happen on the field, then you can bet your life on the fact the manager considered the same idea. So things are at play that are beyond us fully understanding.  I think just having a guy like Muelensteen or some other seasoned veteran in a GM role would do wonders for a young manager like Curtin. I don't think we can make a full assessment of him as a coach until he's given better resources both in players and staff, so I'm hopeful that there will be legitimate changes (for the better) made in the off season with the CBA happening, new money coming in with regard to the media deal, etc. We'll see, but I'm not as quick as others to want Curtin out of that role and I'm not as quick as others to reduce the months of sustained success to just doing the obvious. I think there's more to it than that."
PhillyUnion,2k1og7,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Thu Oct 23 15:21:03 2014 UTC,"I agree, but I think you can find other owners with the same or better qualities than Sak. Nothing about him is so profoundly unique that he needs to stay and the team couldn't go on without him. That's my issue. Yeah, he has some redeeming qualities, but don't you find those and more in the league's better ownership groups? To me, those qualities do not outweigh the negatives. Moreover, I think his handling of the business side of things is not as stellar as some are making them out to be. He argued with paying taxes to Chester leading many to speculate the team was in a bad financial position. He drug his feet for years on proper training facilities. Hell, we don't even have paved parking lots yet. I wouldn't even give him that much credit for bringing the team here in the first place. It was more a matter of circumstance that the league and supporters desired expansion and the state being forthcoming with much of the funds needed to build facilities. Sak and the ownership group largely benefited from that situation.   So all in all, yeah he might have friends in high places, and he might be ok on the business side of things, but is that enough to justify him staying? As with much else Union it seems like he works out to be mediocre at best, and heading into MLS 3.0 we're going to need more than that if we want a winning franchise."
PhillyUnion,2k1og7,xenoletum,2,Thu Oct 23 15:37:00 2014 UTC,"The number 1 most important quality for an owner: An actual interest in owning a team in that particular city. It's not like there's a glut of rich guys who want to pay to own a franchise, especially one that's arguable a failing franchise with declining ticket sales."
PhillyUnion,2k1og7,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Thu Oct 23 16:04:15 2014 UTC,"The declining average attendance, and yes, I realize it is tickets ""sold"", is still not any more than 1000 below what the stadium's capacity is.  This isn't a dire situation like attendance in Houston, Chicago, or San Jose was last year.  Now would a playoff run help boost sales and actual ticketed attendance, yes, as would help any team ( DC Average this year is up 25% over last year due to how good they actually are doing ).  I will argue that the Union aren't a failing franchise.  If you want to look at failing, glance over at Chivas USA and what an actual team with an owner that has no interest in owning a team looks like.  8000 people at games at Stubhub, no TV time whatsoever, and is being contracted out next season.  We still have Comcast airing games regularly, ABC pulling in some games during the day, and of course the occasional rivalry game on NBC Sports.  Keystone is having some issues, but the franchise is hardly failing."

Trade Adu to find WC winner that never plays? Makes no sense, That whole Le Toux thing was so depressing. He literally said to Sak ""Give me a fair number. I'll stay."" Sak let Nowak sack him. I doubt Okugo will sign on. We're a fucking mess. That is FO mismanagement. Not Curtin's fault. I'm out until he is gone. Done with my tickets. You can't keep firing the fry cook because he doesn't know how to make a 4 course meal. It's f-ing bonkers. ....and Sak is playing puppets. He's not a maestro.  He's a hindrance.

So he's not going to get sacked anytime soon.    Hopefully he's smart enough to realize he fucking sucks when it comes to soccer decisions, and needs step down from making the sporting decisions.  He clearly has some business acumen since he's been able to jump from team to team making false promises that never went fulfilled.    It's clear though we need to bring someone in to be GM, let Sak handle business aspects and the GM has full power over the sporting sides of things.  This franchise needs a true identity, and we need some real stability.  This franchise has been a revolving door of players and coaches since it's inception.  The only two things that have been consistent is the mediocre play on the field and Sak leading the franchise."

Also the Algerian invasion on Facebook is quite a load of bullshit having to hear about all of the great things Rais has done while watching him pass the ball to the opposing team almost in the box is quite annoying.

If he bombs out as head coach that's basically going to be the end for him.   Think of it this way: do you see anyone giving Hackworth a second chance?"

PhillyUnion,2jnl31,SirMothy,6,Sun Oct 19 04:27:26 2014 UTC,"It just seems like the easy route for them. Sure, Curtin worked in the beginning and the team rolled some momentum. But since the Open Cup loss I just...there's something hanging over the team. His post game pressers and open showing of frustration tell me he's not quite ready to take this leap full time. Specifically, I'm thinking of the ""You can't make this shit up"" dropped on his way out of the post-Crew collapse conference.  Not just on that, but the Union has connections they just don't seem to want to use. We know Meulensteen has been pressing for this job and that the Union FO appear to have some connection with David Moyes. You're going to tell me they can't find someone, anyone, with a bigger strength of resume than Curtin? It reeks of lazy. It reeks of money and control grab. That the FO can't cede control enough to allow the manager to actually do the damn job.  The M'bolhi signing has made me insanely angry. I've been through the goaltender carousel enough times with the Flyers. In 5 years we've had 6 goalkeepers. This season alone, we upped that count by 2 with Blake and M'bolhi. Sak is a former goalkeeper and he can't even get THAT part right, much less fixing our team's other problems.  And, finally, I moved. I moved down to Baltimore for work over the summer. I've taken days off and done many long drives to come up for games since I've been down here. If I felt positive about the direction of the team, I'd continue to make my commitment to take that drive, to make that journey. But for a club that has no direction other than perennial mid table, stringing us along just enough to keep those ticket sales coming in, but not enough to ever actually do anything, then I'm out.  end rant. tl;dr: Union have no direction other than to just play the middle ground, and I'm not driving an hour plus to suffer through it"
PhillyUnion,2jnl31,Syaoran89,2,Sun Oct 19 07:21:45 2014 UTC,this team needs a culture change. curtin isn't a culture change. just another assistant with no experience from the same coaching tree as the previous 2 coaches.

Ribiero also played better than usual, but was disappointing when he stubbed his toe instead of scoring a second goal.  MacMath made up for the penalty with some big saves in the second half. Still, I hope we see M'bolhi in the next game. They already paid for him, so they might as well start the World Cup goalie."

PhillyUnion,2jbdnj,rabidfrodo,3,Thu Oct 16 00:39:59 2014 UTC,The SoBs will never openly speak against the FO. They're too closely intertwined (i.e. in bed with). They'll more likely call us shit supporters for not blindly supporting the team instead of publicly protesting the FO.

I don't hate Curtin but I 100% don't think he's gonna be a good coach within the next few years. He's too young and inexperienced to risk having as coach. He didn't do anything this year for me to think he can be better in the future. His tactics suck, he's generic and predictable each game. Fuck this team as long as Sak is leading it."

That's really cool."" But now I need the FO to show that they're not happy to just take our money and exist. That seems to be Sak's plan.  We won't get relegated. The families will keep coming out and spending $250 twice a season on a nice Saturday kick off and people will spend $120 ludicrous dollars on shirts and we'll  be business as usual.  It sounds so hackneyed to say the ownership doesn't care about hardcore fans, but its worse than that. They don't care about fans at all. They care about customers. This organization is being run like an entertainment operation, not a professional sports franchise. They've determined that the costs of winning outweigh the benefts.

That isn't to say we don't need a striker or a true left back, but this team has a void in the leadership on the field when it shouldn't and is being mismanaged from the CEO's chair.   With Sak running this team we won't get any better. He gave up power once and will use that as an example to others why he needs to control everything. That's why we have technical director that retired last year. Why our managers have been first timers with little power to influence change on the personnel. Sak is ruining this team."

PhillyUnion,2j5lva,-smokeandmirrors-,6,Tue Oct 14 19:10:15 2014 UTC,Sak needs to go.
PhillyUnion,2j400e,goatyhead,27,Mon Oct 13 12:41:37 2014 UTC,"They can't score goals. Connor Casey is a great piece and Le toux as a scoring winger is another. We need a 15 goal a season guy to come in and we can't pussy foot around or try to scrape some deal or some prospect. We didn't have a 10 so we paid money and got exactly what we needed in Maidana. If you pay you get talent. We need to look in the championship or Bundesliga and pick someone up.  We concede soft goals regularly. This one is harder to address because the blame doesn't fall on one player. I think consistancy is the big thing here. We had a rotating captain this year, revolving door at CB (at least until Valdés came back), and the boondoggle at GK. Add on to that the coach question mark and you've got a pretty tumultuous situation.   We need a captain who isn't Brian Carrol. I respect the heck out of the guy, but he's done. Luckily I think we've dealt with the issue this year and I don't  expect to see him back in a big capacity (maybe at all). I'd like to see Okugo get the nod full time. I think he gains the confidence when you give him the keys.   We need a back four. Valdés is obvious. Gaddis is obvious. Is Sheanon worth keeping around? I think he probably gets taken in the expansion draft which creates a need at FB. Who takes the second CB spot? I'm perfectly happy seeing Edu go so is it Berry or White or somebody new? I don't care. I think both those boys are good enough so no reason spunking money on CB.   We need to resolve the GK thing before the season starts. We can't have MacMath and M 'bohli on the same roster. I think everyone realizes that. What we do is immaterial to me. I wouldn't mind keeping MacMath as I love the coming of age thing, and saving money is nice too...  I love Curtin and I want him to stick around, but I don't think he's the answer. I'd love to see Muelensteen come in and really take charge with authority. Say what you want of Nowak but he lead with authority.   There ya go. That's how we fix the team"
PhillyUnion,2j400e,Mike81890,5,Mon Oct 13 13:44:32 2014 UTC,"i think we should definitely keep shaneon. He was our best player last year and started off the season injured, which could have hurt confidence. I wouldnt want to ditch a player after 1 bad season. Heck, we kept Carroll for 3"
PhillyUnion,2j400e,marksills,2,Mon Oct 13 16:58:56 2014 UTC,"I don't mind keeping Sheanon. I love him as a Union member, but reality with the expansion draft means it might be prudent to trade him for some value before hand"
PhillyUnion,2j400e,Mike81890,2,Mon Oct 13 18:05:54 2014 UTC,"I'd argue Sheanon has been bad 1.5 of the last two seasons, and Carroll has been bad the last 2 seasons. So really similar in reality."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,drewuke,2,Mon Oct 13 22:32:10 2014 UTC,"We need a captain who isn't Brian Carrol. I respect the heck out of the guy, but he's done. Luckily I think we've dealt with the issue this year and I don't expect to see him back in a big capacity (maybe at all).   He had a great run, but he's old now and he's slow and his stamina is down... He looks gassed after a full half. I could see him being a good piece to bring on as a sub when we're up 2-0 and we just need to hold up play (OH wait...)    Is Sheanon worth keeping around?    Sheannon was great last year. This year: His motivation seems to be gone. I'd love to see the guy play in his old form, but can we really expect that? I don't think so.    I'm perfectly happy seeing Edu go    Edu has gotten better in that CB role. But he is salary cap space and there are plenty of options out there.    I love Curtin and I want him to stick around, but I don't think he's the answer.   I feel the same way. I think he needs to be an assistant coach because there's clearly something between him and the players. He's just not really ready to be a head coach."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,KFCConspiracy,3,Mon Oct 13 13:56:18 2014 UTC,The problem with subbing BC on is that he's got no height so he can't defend long balls or set pieces at the end of the day too well. I prefer Lahoud for that.
PhillyUnion,2j400e,Mike81890,3,Mon Oct 13 13:59:33 2014 UTC,"If it's an Okugo or Edu situation I'd rather see Okugo stay for a lot of reasons: last of the originals, more upside, history with Valdes if he's needed at CB.  I'd love it if Sheanon should go for a LB. He's clearly not happy here anymore and has played an increasingly petulant game. The number of times he's flopped for a foul this year has been embarrassing. Plus his form has been terrible compared to last year.  I like Curtin a lot, just not as a head coach, not yet at least. There is a pretty good history of younger, former-player coaches finding success in MLS but I don't think here or now is the time to try that. Much like the Flyers, I think the Union suffers from too much in-house groupthink."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,DoubleHappyDave,2,Mon Oct 13 14:31:28 2014 UTC,"I think we need to keep both.  More upside with Okugo, more flexibility with Edu and lots of depth with both.  With the cap rising, this should not be an issue."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,DoubleHappyDave,1 point,Mon Oct 13 20:45:25 2014 UTC,I have conveniently forgotten the cap rising.   If you keep Edu what do you do with the Edu/Okugo situation? It doesn't seem like Edu wants CB minutes and I don't really want to push Okugo back there.
PhillyUnion,2j400e,atypicalclothespin,2,Tue Oct 14 17:04:54 2014 UTC,"I really, really hope Edu is willing to rotate or play straight CB.  He didn't play well enough to likely get EPL offers, so my guess is he should be willing to work something out.    Frankly Ethan White needs to go to the bench and Edu needs to play CB.  Then if you have a midfield injury or fatigue, bring in White at CB and move Edu to mid."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,Mike81890,1 point,Tue Oct 14 17:32:11 2014 UTC,"Am I the only one that thinks Jack Mac would be a perfect fit for this team? If he can rediscover is form from before whatever the hell happened with the National Team he could easily become the 15 goal a season guy we need. Jack always had his head up and was looking to exploit space and gaps in the defense and with guys like Wenger, Maidana, and Nogueira providing quality service i feel like he could thrive. Especially since he was a much, much, much better possession player than Casey or Brown or Ribiero or anyone else we have up top, which fits with the style of our new players. Maybe there will be a slim chance Montreal will let him go since he didn't see a great amount of field time and we can bring him back. Just my opinion of course."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,leftyboy87,1 point,Sun Oct 26 21:23:55 2014 UTC,No. Jack has no place here in Philly again. I think everyone has overemphasized his skill and I doubt we'll ever see Jack break the 10 goal mark again.   It's not just me being a hater. I think Jack is a limited player who capitalized on nobody paying any attention and now he's been found out.
PhillyUnion,2j400e,FlapjackJackson,15,Mon Oct 27 03:05:52 2014 UTC,"Sackiewicz. He is the face of player acquisition. He put this roster together. We know he's made decisions against the will of the manager before (Nikolov) so he bears full responsibility for roster construction. Look at what he is responsible for:   M'Bohli. It has been discussed to death, so no need to go in detail there. Unnecessary move. No depth. Look at the Open Cup final; all three Seattle subs could have started for us in that game. In a similar vein: When Maidana can't play the 10, we turn to . . . Fred? Seriously? Also in a similar vein: How many defensive midfielders does it take to change a lightbulb? The team hasn't had a left back since Jordan Harvey. We don't have a starting caliber striker. Casey is aging and must be replaced, and no Brown was not an acceptable move. We're paying insane amounts of money to players like Carroll and Cruz, sucking up cap space, when we have three signed homegrown players with near zero playing time.   No matter who the manager is, if Nicky Sack is running the show, this team will never win a damn thing."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,Dean_Moriarty,2,Mon Oct 13 14:55:58 2014 UTC,"Dude, Cruz makes like $120k. That's a pretty meager amount, especially with the cap raising. His salary is fine.  Carroll's contract is up after this year.  In a long-term perspective, MBolhi makes sense. We weren't a playoff team this year. MBolhi was made with next year in mind. He gives us an upgrade at striker, and he turns MacMath into an asset we can trade for something else.  The striker will come this offseason when we have more time to find the right fit."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,FlapjackJackson,6,Mon Oct 13 20:22:50 2014 UTC,"120K isn't an insane amount of money, but I do think it's overpaying by a lot for Cruz.  At least under the current salary cap it is overpaying, you aren't going to hit on all your signings but we could do a hell of a lot better with that money."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,mthslhrookiecard,2,Mon Oct 13 22:17:51 2014 UTC,Danny is depth. Something we badly need

PhillyUnion,2j400e,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Tue Oct 14 13:38:11 2014 UTC,We may just be misusing him then. He comes on when we need goals but he just isn't a goal scorer in a reliable sense. I guess it all comes back to us needing that killer up top.

They lost all leverage.  Then again, I was convinced Valdes was gone forever, so I'll probably be wrong here again too."

PhillyUnion,2j400e,SirMothy,7,Mon Oct 13 18:40:18 2014 UTC,"Most of y'all can't see the forest for the trees. The roster problems are small in comparison to the organizational ones.   Curtin, Sorber, and Albright are the only members of our coaching staff. How do we expect to compete with three full time coaches? We need a ton of new coaches. Albright is our only ""scout."" We can't compete if we can't unearth good talent. RSL is the best example of what good scouting can do for a team on a budget. We need a GM. It will take decisions out of Nick's hands. We need a clear path for youth development. While Zardes and Yedlin star for their teams, Pfeffer is fucking around in the reserves while Jimmy is languishing in Harrisburg. How do we expect to develop our young talent if we never play them? We have no identity. At least under Nowak we were clearly a team that fought tooth and nails and hit you on the counter. Since Hack, we have been generic MLS team C without any sort of idea of how we want to play. This identity is a big part of developing a plan moving forward. Do we want to be a possession team? Then we need a target man who can distribute. Do we want to be a counter team? Then we need faster wingers. Pick an identity, and develop it. After all this, we need a manager. I'd prefer Rene, but I can settle with Curtin. If we sign Curtin, it will be a growing experience.   This comes first. Looking at the roster itself, it's not as bad as people think. Here's what we need:   A top, starting striker. This is where most of the money needs to go. Bring in a consistent finisher who can score week in and week out. A starting LB. Keep Gaddis on the right. A young striker. This player would be a sub option to either spell our starter or play off him to change the formation and tactics. This would be a depth guy. A speedy traditional winger. We have two physical guys out wide and a workhorse. We need someone with speed and some technical skill. This would be a depth guy. Jimmy looks like he can fill this role, but we don't know until he plays.   These additions would go a long, long way. Outside of them, general depth would be nice."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,FlapjackJackson,4,Mon Oct 13 20:20:21 2014 UTC,"+10000 to the GM need. It's painful watching Sak strut around after he makes an idiot deal then get all pissed off when someone asks ""stupid"" questions like ""why do you need 3 starting keepers"".  I'm no expert but no scouts and 3 coaches doesn't a strong front office make. Utterly ridiculous. If that keeps up we are headed straight for Chivas Town."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,KFCConspiracy,1 point,Mon Oct 13 20:37:38 2014 UTC,"We have no identity.    I really do not agree with that at all. Our identity is an open attacking style, which led to us scoring more goals then ever before but also giving up a lot. At points this season we had more goals than anyone else. Goals are our identity."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,SirMothy,1 point,Sun Oct 19 04:38:25 2014 UTC,"We spent the first third of the season struggling for goals. Hack also favored posession over attacking. Again, no consistent identity."
PhillyUnion,2j400e,KFCConspiracy,4,Sun Oct 19 13:28:34 2014 UTC,"Here's a list;    Mediocre ""Interim"" coach who can't do much more than the basics.  Stingy management who won't spend on players that they need: Striker, more backs.  Stupid acquisitions hurt morale. We didn't need another goalie. MacMath's made a lot of rookie mistakes, but at the end of the day he's been a decent goal keeper. Everyone knows we need a striker, but they acquired a goalie.... To the locker room that sends the message that the management will replace people for no real reason. Those guys are all friends, shit like that doesn't go over well.  Excuses. The front office can make excuses for anything and change nothing.    Maidana and his schedule: That was an issue at the beginning of the season, Hackworth said (and I believe him) that Maidana was staying up really late constantly right before games. That's a legitimate complaint if it's true. But apparently that's stopped.   Talent-wise and playoff wise: Had we won 2 more games that we'd tied the conversation wouldn't be what it is right now. We definitely dropped a lot of points at the beginning that we could have had, and we did the same in the last couple of weeks. That being said, we don't have a real target striker and we have some deficiencies as far as depth in the back field, and sub-wise we don't really have anyone who we could put on in the attacking half to add to our offense. So had we made a playoff run, it probably would not have been a deep playoff run. Talent-wise the front office has been trying to get players at a discount and has made some bad decisions as far as what to acquire... For example we have way more CDMs than we need, and no striker.   The big underlying problem is the management continues to settle for mediocre at a discount. Both in terms of player acquisition and in terms of coaching. ""Interim"" Coach Hackworth and ""Interim"" Coach Curtin are great examples of this... Both came off of firings of other coaches from within, and both were discount coaches. And aside from the stinginess, the management has misplayed its player relationships horribly and it really seems like some players at the core of our team are not that happy here and will go elsewhere if nothing changes.   At the end of the day to motivate the players they need a great coach and a FO that will show that it's willing to spend where it's needed.   But really the problem is we boo too much when we lose 3-2 in a game in which we were up 2-0. /s"

PhillyUnion,2j0yjc,thewizardofosmium,8,Sun Oct 12 13:54:11 2014 UTC,"Not sure about past seasons, but, from what I quickly looked at, we blew 9 leads this season.  Portland - 1 goal lead blown in 94' - Result: Tie  Montreal - 1 goal lead blown in 80' - Result: Tie  Chicago - 1 goal lead blown in 86' - Result: Tie  Seattle - 1 goal lead blown in 61' - Result: Loss (SEA scored again 84')  Vancouver - 1 goal lead blown in 81' - Result: Tie  Colorado - 2 goal lead blown with 2 goals (79' / 86') - Result: Tie  San Jose - 2 goal lead blown with 2 goals (59' / 70') - Result: Win (PHI scored 2, 72' / 79').  Chicago - 1 goal lead blown in 92' - Result: Tie  Columbus -2 goal lead blown with 2 goals (78' / 79') - Result: Loss (CLB scored again 82')  So, we were 1-2-6 in games we blew a lead for 9 points. The 6 games that resulted in ties represent 12 lost points. Add those back in, and we are solidly in 2nd in the East, with an outside chance for 1st."
PhillyUnion,2j0yjc,starcom_magnate,6,Mon Oct 13 13:14:23 2014 UTC,"And someone else can calculate the number of blown leads in a season.   Oof.  Not sure where to begin research on that one.  But if I may piggyback on your post with something else I did last night....  Speaking on MLS matches only, this season has sucked.  Last season sucked as well.  Our first season really sucked, but we passed judgement  simply because we had a team.  But after last night's loss, the thought creeped into my head: just how bad have we been in our 5-year history?  As it turns out, the Union rank 14th (out of 19) for average PPG during our 5-year history.

PhillyUnion,2ipmsx,OshiHidra,4,Thu Oct 9 21:07:11 2014 UTC,"It would be totally awesome but    Altidore's relative lack of playing time has left him concerned about his standing with U.S. manager Jurgen Klinsmann, who has urged his men to play for clubs where they can be regular fixtures in the starting XI.   http://www.espnfc.us/story/2078500/jozy-altidore-open-to-leaving-sunderland-in-january-if-playing-time-doesnt-improve   I don't see him coming to the US any time soon. Klinsmann wants his players to play in Europe for the time being.   I'd love to see some more American players come home but you can't deny being able to play against greater talent, IE ones that will play for their national teams is a huge plus.  I yearn for the day that playing in the MLS is seen as a good thing, a time when we're on par with some of the other European Leagues (Premier, Bundes, La Liga, Serie A excluded just because they are so established and are the top talent in the world)"
PhillyUnion,2ipmsx,-smokeandmirrors-,3,Thu Oct 9 02:47:52 2014 UTC,"I'm not getting the implication here you seem to be. Jugen wants players to get consistent time on the starting XI, but that doesn't mean it has to be in Europe. A significant amount of the national team is being drawn from MLS. Hell, even Edu came to Philly to get time on the field in preparation for a national team call up. If Altidore came to the U he would be a lock for the starting XI, and that can only help his case right now."

PhillyUnion,2inis1,drayb3,7,Wed Oct 8 12:06:18 2014 UTC,"Actually, it looks like he's only getting the start due to M'bolhi being on international duty. Didn't realize Rais was away."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,akuller,2,Wed Oct 8 12:08:11 2014 UTC,Too bad that there are strings attached.
PhillyUnion,2inis1,FlapjackJackson,0,Wed Oct 8 12:55:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah. Let's get rid of a guy who made one mistake, and play someone who has made a career out of mistakes. While we are at it, let's bring Freddy Adu and Porifio Lopez back. So glad you aren't a GM, or we would be the new Chivas."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,akuller,3,Wed Oct 8 17:26:41 2014 UTC,I was saying I want Zac to start not to get rid of Rais. If we do want to trade Zac then him starting raises his value when he preforms.  Also Rais is still a waste of money.
PhillyUnion,2inis1,mthslhrookiecard,2,Wed Oct 8 17:57:04 2014 UTC,I'd rather pay someone 90k a year to make a few mistakes than pay someone several hundred thousand a year + a DP spot to make a few mistakes...
PhillyUnion,2inis1,FlapjackJackson,3,Wed Oct 8 19:00:02 2014 UTC,"MBolhi isn't a DP. He makes around 240k a year, less than Perkins and Ricketts. Zac is on the last year of his deal (or next to last), and he will get a raise to at least 200k. You really think his contract will stay at 90k?"
PhillyUnion,2inis1,akuller,1 point,Wed Oct 8 19:02:45 2014 UTC,the number for M'boli for this season is 200K+ but that is just for part of a season.  He will be making closer 650k next season from what I have seen. Zac will get a raise maybe close to 2000k but it wont affect the team as much because the salary cap is being re-negotiated this offseason when they negotiate the new cba.
PhillyUnion,2inis1,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Oct 9 17:44:28 2014 UTC,"Nah. His salary is pretty consistent. May raise slightly, but it won't be that high.  MacMath's salary will still be close to MBolhi."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,akuller,1 point,Thu Oct 9 18:02:10 2014 UTC,650k came because of his 403k+ transfer fee + his salary for this year of 240k
PhillyUnion,2inis1,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:00:39 2014 UTC,Transfer fee is broken up and not paid at once.
PhillyUnion,2inis1,akuller,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:11:11 2014 UTC,I was saying that is how i was getting to the 650 and that you were right his cap hit is only 240K per year
PhillyUnion,2inis1,Dean_Moriarty,12,Thu Oct 9 19:26:06 2014 UTC,"I think it was the phillysoccershow podcast that made the point an episode or two ago, if we lose MacMath next year and keep M'Bolhi and Blake we are going to need to rely on a third string keeper on a semi often basis.  Both M'Bolhi and Blake are international keepers for their country and will likely be away for FIFA dates. If MLS continues to schedule games on those dates we will have to start a third string keeper which means we'll probably need to overpay some guy who is backup quality to be a reserve keeper.  Just more money wasted on that position."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,Dean_Moriarty,6,Wed Oct 8 13:30:19 2014 UTC,Never thought about that. Shit.
PhillyUnion,2inis1,keystonemike,20,Wed Oct 8 13:51:05 2014 UTC,"That's alright, Sakiewicz probably didn't either lol."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,akuller,2,Wed Oct 8 14:48:58 2014 UTC,"Let's map the logic:  1) GK is really important. Can't have young guy make mistakes. Pay for quality.  2) Have multiple national team GKs on roster, awesome.  3) International window. Shit, need to use 3rd stringer.  4) Can't pay that much for GK, go cheap.  5) Hire Philly cop (a la Joe Nasco) - get 1st minute red cards and games with 3 GK errors leading to goals.  6) GK is really important?"
PhillyUnion,2inis1,Dean_Moriarty,3,Thu Oct 9 19:35:37 2014 UTC,Maybe Blake is trade bait
PhillyUnion,2inis1,HandsomePete215,1 point,Wed Oct 8 14:09:50 2014 UTC,"Could be, I'd think Blake has the highest trade value out of all three keepers too.  MacMath is a known quantity and M'Bolhi is too expensive. But Blake is on a GA contract and hasn't played that often that he's been exposed in anyway significant that he probably still has that ""high upside"" shine to his name."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,jpoRS,4,Wed Oct 8 14:32:51 2014 UTC,"I don't know about you guys, but I love our new part-time keeper."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,Dean_Moriarty,2,Wed Oct 8 14:20:56 2014 UTC,"Is M'Bolhi signed or on loan? I'm not changing my mind, I still think he was the right move at the time and I do believe he is a better keeper than MacMath (now and for at least the next few years).   But I am pondering now, would it be completely crazy to keep Zac and send M'Bolhi back/leave him out in the expansion draft? If M'Bolhi isn't that much better (which we haven't seen yet), and he is going to be getting called off for national team duties ... Blake has promise but just isn't someone we can trust yet. Good for early USOC games, meaningless games against whoever-replaces-Chivas-as-the-bottom-of-the-West, but not ready for the big show ...  I don't know, I'm still higher than most here on M'Bolhi, but it is something to consider from a business standpoint."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,FlapjackJackson,9,Wed Oct 8 14:13:35 2014 UTC,"He's not on a loan, full time Union player. I think we even had to pay a big transfer fee for him too but I might be wrong about that.    But in my opinion no matter if you are pro/anti/indifferent on M'Bolhi we should not be protecting him in the expansion draft.  If you are pro, his contract is so big for a keeper nobody is going to take that on and we can use that to protect someone else.  And if you are anti M'Bolhi then you definitely don't want to protect him."
PhillyUnion,2inis1,akuller,3,Wed Oct 8 15:12:50 2014 UTC,His contract isn't that big. He makes less than Ricketts and Perkins. One of the expansion teams could easily draft him and deal him elsewhere in the league.
PhillyUnion,2id151,hoax021,18,Sun Oct 5 15:23:37 2014 UTC,Definitely shots fired.

PhillyUnion,2id151,Luzzi15,3,Sun Oct 5 21:42:46 2014 UTC,unless an M'Bohli save wins the U a piece of hardware he will never win me over. He will just happen to be the goalie between the pipes that I dont want there otherwise.

""only going to get better with age and experience"" - Salty they benched him/gonna get rid of him instead of letting him grow to become a better keeper which frankly i think he prob hit his ceiling already and wont get much better. He'll always be mediocre."

PhillyUnion,2id151,TomCosella,1 point,Tue Oct 7 14:07:53 2014 UTC,"I understand why he's pissed but it's not helping him in any way.  And it's definitely not helping the other players on the training field/city park/locker room and it's definitely not helping the fans.  What I want is a team making the playoffs for once. His whining about the situation, rightfully or not, is actively making that less likely. For that I won't forgive him even if he is 23 years old. Because to me that's old enough to act like a pro.  Especially when you've been a starter for as long as he has."
PhillyUnion,2id151,goatyhead,1 point,Wed Oct 8 15:39:44 2014 UTC,"The guy acted like a pro the entire time he was here, even after Blake was drafted to take his place.  The guy put together multiple great seasons and for some reason the FO is actively trying to ship him out, that's where the professionalism is lacking.  I have no problem with his reaction, especially with M'boli making blunders and not even being here for the stretch run."
PhillyUnion,2id151,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Oct 8 16:58:12 2014 UTC,"I don't know if I'd agree to multiple great seasons. He was solid from mid-last year and improving all the way up to this debacle. Before that he was definitely a promising young keeper, making all the mistakes that entails.  The point is he can hate the front office shenanigans just as much as we do. But it's not doing anything but bringing bad karma to the locker room to air it out publicly like this.  Even when he's 100% in the right.  For the record I think it was insane to even bring M'Bolhi in. Much less give him starts given his international schedule and the timing of his arrival to the team. He should have been solidly on the bench and in training offering whatever mentoring he could until next season. Again, it smacks wholly of Nick Sac's MO to force him into the lineup so he can look so smart."
PhillyUnion,2iadig,thewizardofosmium,9,Sat Oct 4 17:03:13 2014 UTC,"Not to pick on anyone, but first thing we all should do is learn how to spell Curtin's name correctly.  And my complaint with Curtin last game was his unwillingness to change.  The 4-2-3-1 counter attacking type style worked well for awhile after he took over but we've been really struggling to score goals over the past 4-5 games.  A change was needed, and with guys missing it was the perfect chance to adapt, perfect chance to prove he knew what he was doing and can make adjustments after the league adjusts to him.  Instead everything was like for like.  We didn't change how we played to adapt to how teams were playing us and the players we had available.  Could have gone 4-4-2 with two strikers.  Could have gone to a more attacking 4-3-3 and gave McLaughlin a chance to tear up the right wing.  Yeah our roster is limited, but there are ways to tweak and change how we play and Curtin did not show he is capable of doing that. That's why I was disappointed."
PhillyUnion,2iadig,Dean_Moriarty,4,Sat Oct 4 17:26:47 2014 UTC,"He managed it like Hack would have, down to the Hoppenot sub."
PhillyUnion,2iadig,drewuke,1 point,Sat Oct 4 19:57:02 2014 UTC,"Well did we really have that many good choices on the roster up top or as an attacking player in general? I think the Hoppenot thing underlined the fact that we have no striker, let alone depth at that position. We have plenty of CDMs and goalies though!"
PhillyUnion,2iadig,KFCConspiracy,2,Mon Oct 6 13:28:04 2014 UTC,"Curtin was celebrated because he simplified a system that was clearly not working.  Hack had a bad habit of moving guys in to positions they weren't used to playing and changing formations seemingly at random.  Curtin came in and did the opposite.  Everybody got a set position, there was one formation, the players suddenly understood their responsibilities, and things were good.  The problem with keeping things that simple is that other teams figure it out and how best to handle it.  The Chicago game was a good chance to try something different.  The Union had started struggling and they had an opportunity to come out with a different look or to try something different.  Instead, it was more of the same.  That's a problem.  There's a happy medium between Hack and Curtin.  Maybe our next manager will find it."

PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,TheDuckyNinja,7,Fri Oct 3 16:14:07 2014 UTC,I disagree completely.  You can't control if a player is going to make a huge error.  MacMath  could very easily have done the same thing ; Lord knows he's had many crucial errors of his own.   This article is convenient and lazy journalism.     The much bigger issue is how long the management allowed Hack to have a job.  That's what put us in this position.
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,violacurva,7,Fri Oct 3 16:52:54 2014 UTC,"Thank you. I'm not going to completely defend Nick but I don't understand how people can't see how this team is heading in the right direction. So what if we don't make the playoffs. I thought Philly was all about winning championships and there was always no way that was happening this year. Instead we now have a goalie, who despite his mistake last night, has the experience to win big games. Macmath and blake may have nice futures but tell me one team who has won a championship with a young goalie recently.   Bringing in Valdes, edu, nogueria, and maidiana has made our defense and midfield one of the best on paper in the league. Now with the cap going up and some bad contracts coming off the books we have space to grab a good striker. If they fail at that then i think it will be fair to call for some major changes   EDIT: grammar"
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,marksills,5,Fri Oct 3 17:41:43 2014 UTC,"how long can we keep saying this? hackworth's first year we saw some improvements and said were on the right track with some young players. just missed the playoffs last year and still on the right track. then this year, we bring in 5 veteran players, have an older team, and were gonna end up with less points than last year. Sak constantly hires poor coaches, doesnt address clear needs and weve been one of the worst teams in the league over the last 5 years. I would love to see him out ASAP"
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,violacurva,3,Fri Oct 3 17:49:02 2014 UTC,Keeping hackworth for so long this season definitely was a mistake and he shouldn't be excused for that. He has some huge decisions to make this offseason as far as who will be the coach and what striker we bring in. But this is the first time I feel like we are actually investing money into the team so I want to see what he does with it
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,marksills,2,Fri Oct 3 18:07:02 2014 UTC,"keeping hackworth for the beggining of the season was a mistake. also my problem is were spending money but no improvements. we got rid of a striker, where we basically had one backup who is old/has injury history and doesnt look to be in the best shape and did not replace him, when we were clearly willing to spend."
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,violacurva,1 point,Fri Oct 3 18:11:40 2014 UTC,Saying it right now doesn't look so good but I honestly believe that rais is an improvement over Macmath. And getting Valdes back significantly improved the defense. Nogueria and maidaina significantly improve the midfield over  last years train wreck. The only area I don't think we are improved is up front so I agree with you there. With some money to spend this offseason we should be able to improve in that area and get some much needed depth on this team. No excuses if they screw that up
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Oct 3 18:46:55 2014 UTC,"Sak doesn't consistently hire bad coaches. Nowak was a very good coach, but he was a mad man. The jury is still out on Curtin.  Doesn't address clear needs? Our midfield was the problem last year. What did Sak do this offseason? He bought three midfielders. You aren't being fair on this one."
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,marksills,1 point,Sun Oct 5 14:18:59 2014 UTC,"I dont think Nowak was a very good coach. 1st year, i wont really judge him for as we were a new team. 2nd year, ill give you he did a good job and as a team we made some good acquisitions. Also le toux played out of his mind the 2nd half of that season. But its not like he was mistake free. He played Miglioranzi way too much that year, with that peaking in the playoffs when he inexplicably played with 5 in the back at home, which was a fortress that year.Why he played a mediocre defensive mid as a 3rd centerback in the home tie of a place where i think we lost once all year is beyond me. So even at his best, he made tons of questionable moves. And we all know what happened the 3rd year. In addition to his players absolutely hating him, he played players out of position, he did not use young talent on his bench (notably okugo and mcinerney, who were sitting behind our two worst starting players that year, Pajoy and Carroll, and had some pretty bad acquisitions that year. So i do not believe nowak was a good coach. He never should have brought back Hack this year, and he should not bring back Curtain as he probably is going to.   We'd been lacking a midfield, specifically a defensive midfielder since at least after the 2nd season. It took long enough for that. We clearly needed a striker if we were going to get rid of mcinerney and we failed to replace that. There's a reason we've been one of the worst teams in the time we've been a team.The only constants in that time have been Sak and Amobi, and im pretty sure amobi isnt the reason"
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Sun Oct 5 19:58:49 2014 UTC,"Nowak did win an MLS Cup.  Questionable decisions aside, he showed an ability to rotate some of the players to keep them fresh as well as a willingness to give young players minutes. He had some good success with his draft picks and signed a lot of good (but some bad) talent.  The team has a fight to it we haven't seen since.  Nowak was actually a good coach for us until he melted down."
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,SirMothy,1 point,Sun Oct 5 21:38:57 2014 UTC,"I just hope they allow Curtin to stay on, he has turned things around, give him more time"
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,marksills,1 point,Sat Oct 4 01:18:01 2014 UTC,and how theyre going to give curtain a job even tho his honeymoon has already run its course
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,thewizardofosmium,2,Fri Oct 3 17:51:24 2014 UTC,"The problem isn't that Mbolhi screwed up last night.  It is that he has made questionable plays in almost every game.  His first game with the Union he made some error in goal on the Seaport Rd side that a defender had to clear up.  On balance, no better than Macmath and that is unacceptable in a salary-capped league.  Sak made the same mistake so many US soccer fans do of assuming national team performance indicates great league play.  Adu is the worst example of this, but Benny Feilhaber and his one great goal in the Gold Cup is another."
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,SirMothy,1 point,Fri Oct 3 18:36:31 2014 UTC,Feilhaber is a really good player so idk what you are on about
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,thewizardofosmium,0,Sat Oct 4 01:17:31 2014 UTC,"Feilhaber is indeed a good player, but don't forget the hue and cry after that Gold Cup.  He was anointed the next savior of American soccer and declared to have unparalleled skills.  Then he was cut by a couple European teams and finally from USMNT camp.  It would be as if people had proclaimed Danny Cruz as a great goal scorer based on that one fantastic goal he had a few months back."
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,SirMothy,1 point,Sat Oct 4 13:09:08 2014 UTC,I'd say the biggest recent example is Juan Agudelo. Scored in two straight US matches then became insanely hyped even though he has been nothing but inconsistent.
PhillyUnion,2i6xc0,thewizardofosmium,1 point,Sat Oct 4 14:37:15 2014 UTC,Him too.  I don't follow the USMNT as much since the Union started.  Fuck it and their fucking fans who only watch National team soccer and Barcelona.

PhillyUnion,2i75rx,bob-ombshell,2,Fri Oct 3 20:37:27 2014 UTC,what is the status of Le Toux/Casey?
PhillyUnion,2i75rx,SirMothy,1 point,Sat Oct 4 01:18:42 2014 UTC,Entering last game we basically needed at least 10 points to reach at least 48 points. So now we basically have to win out. Drop any points anywhere and it's done.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,Tmmybrbr,13,Fri Oct 3 15:24:09 2014 UTC,"I agree that it was not smart to go back with the ball, but to take all the blame off of Rais is also foolish.  A back-up goalie starting his first game ever in middle school in the rain knows how to clear that ball.  There's absolutely no reason to kick it literally in the second worst spot on the entire field.  The only thing worse would have been him turning around and kicking it in our own net."
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,JoeBenzon,6,Fri Oct 3 15:46:34 2014 UTC,"Agreed. And ALSO maidana should have scored that easy shot and brown shouldn't have punted it half way out of the stadium. Cruz said it best in the interview ""if we had scored two, it wouldn't have mattered"""
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,JoeBenzon,2,Fri Oct 3 20:09:44 2014 UTC,"Brown had an even better chance than that one.  Wenger also had a good look that went probably 30 feet wide.  There was a bunch of opportunities, and we only needed to convert one of them."
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,hoax021,2,Fri Oct 3 20:57:27 2014 UTC,it reminds me of this.why the hell would u pass back to the goalkeeper!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHAEOjaOSY  im a huge m'bohli supporter and i believe he will come out next year a lot better and mroe comfortable.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,bigdogg123,1 point,Fri Oct 3 16:57:11 2014 UTC,"Hopefully I mean we've all seen he's obviously a good keeper.  I hope that the fans and he can have a short memory about this.  Yes it's a depressing and shocking way to have playoff hopes killed, but I don't want it to ruin the guy."
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,akuller,4,Fri Oct 3 18:19:36 2014 UTC,There is a levle of expecation in modern football that the goalie can handle the ball with his feet. This has been the expectation since the rule changes in 1992 when the goalie was no longer able to handle the ball with thier hands when the ball is passed back. It is not unreasonable for the Union to expect him to be able to make a better play there.  The ball did not need to go forward it could have at least gone out of bounds with a chance for the defense to recover some shape.  He had time and couldn't handle the pressure.  I will blame him for this game.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,akuller,0,Fri Oct 3 16:01:54 2014 UTC,Maybe we should've just kicked the set piece out of bounds?
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,marksills,2,Fri Oct 3 16:06:57 2014 UTC,we should have had a few player forward with our defense near midfield/behind the ball and played the ball short between those player forward and tried to keep it in the coner.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,spqr-king,3,Fri Oct 3 17:07:12 2014 UTC,he's a professional goalie give me a break... he even had time for two touches... high school goalies can clear that fairly easily. obviously we were shit all game and shouldve been up at least 2 but that was the worst play of the game. If he cant be expected to handle that he shouldnt be getting paid a dime let alone 200k. that being said my opinion is he usually deals with that and he's a decent goalie but not worth spending what we did on him
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,drewuke,3,Fri Oct 3 17:41:15 2014 UTC,He has to shoulder at least SOME of the blame if not most of it. Of course other things could have gone well but he shot the team in the foot in the final minutes of a sloppily won game. I dont think we can judge him based on it but we can blame him at least part way.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,JoeBenzon,4,Sat Oct 4 01:55:27 2014 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I don't think there is such a thing as an offensive set piece when you're up 1-0 in literally the last minute."
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,drewuke,3,Fri Oct 3 15:46:32 2014 UTC,And that pretty much sums up our season. No pressing incentive to put the ball in the goal. Sometimes I feel like we are trying to play keepaway in the middle of the pitch instead of trying to score.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,garretthav,2,Fri Oct 3 15:58:59 2014 UTC,It doesn't have to be with the intention of trying to score.  Just put the ball forward.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,peewoah1,1 point,Fri Oct 3 16:14:21 2014 UTC,"I don't think there is anything with playing it back there, it's just the worst of the worst possibly happened last night."
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,WildGooseCarolinian,2,Fri Oct 3 16:26:31 2014 UTC,"Any professional keeper should know how to make a pass. He could've just booted it as far as possible if he felt too pressured. Absolutely no excuse, no matter how you slice it."
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,WildGooseCarolinian,2,Fri Oct 3 19:01:04 2014 UTC,I'm just going to leave this here...
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,Kondratev,1 point,Sat Oct 4 13:10:44 2014 UTC,I don't know that I'd put it on brown nearly as much as Ribero.  How many times was he at the top of the 18 with the ball and he easily gave it up or harmlessly passed it to a defender?
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,goatyhead,1 point,Fri Oct 3 21:06:59 2014 UTC,I still don't know why we play ribeiro. Must be just because of his height.
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,thanksbastards,2,Sat Oct 4 11:51:40 2014 UTC,"Well, it's certainly not for his hustle or playmaking ability..."
PhillyUnion,2i70s5,goatyhead,1 point,Tue Oct 7 20:42:01 2014 UTC,"M'Bolhi blew it, but so did almost everyone else. Sometimes it didn't seem like anybody on the field even cared about the result except for Okugo and Valdes. I don't know what was going through their heads to have such a lazy performance during a must-win game. By the time that equalizer came, I didn't give a shit either."
PhillyUnion,2i6jfg,hoax021,9,Fri Oct 3 12:10:36 2014 UTC,"Very odd, indeed. The whole ""Union-snatching-defeat-from-the-jaws-of-victory,"" thing has been going on for 5 seasons. It's definitely not something new.  For all of the nitpickers, yes it was not a defeat, but dropping those 2 points was akin to losing at this point in the season."
PhillyUnion,2i6jfg,starcom_magnate,4,Fri Oct 3 12:38:45 2014 UTC,"Seriously.  A lot of people in here I've never seen before, although granted after last night's game I think venting/posting was akin to therapy, which I know I might need...  But I think there may be a decent amount of newer fans who aren't used to giving up games so late... It's sort of our thing."
PhillyUnion,2i6jfg,midwesternhousewives,3,Fri Oct 3 14:48:24 2014 UTC,the union are like tottenham to me....they also seem to let you down :(

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,Tohaba,6,Fri Oct 3 01:59:38 2014 UTC,"After ADMITTING we were in the market for a striker even while Hack was still coach.   Fuck... the rest of the lineup is solid. The midfield and backline are finally not a liability. If the FO fucks up this off season its time for a serious push to have the whole system cleaned out. From Sack to the coaching staff, shit needs to change yesterday. I will not go to a game. I will not buy more scarves I don't need. I will not be guilted with civic pride and ""true fan"" bullshit to come and watch them trot out absolute shite year after year.   Christ, and I feel bad for the players. They so obviously will play their heart out but they get let down again and again."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,SirMothy,6,Fri Oct 3 02:07:11 2014 UTC,As if MacMath has never made any mistakes? He's woeful at times. And he has also cost us points both this season and in prior seasons.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,jpoRS,5,Fri Oct 3 02:26:33 2014 UTC,"Agreed. M'Bolhi made a game killing mistake, now just a few dozen more and he can catch MacMath."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,-1,Fri Oct 3 04:19:41 2014 UTC,"That cost us the season? Not all the dropped points at the beginning of the year.  You do realize it wasn't MBolhi or a striker right? You act as if there was one lined up when there clearly wasn't.   Seriously, some of you are only happy if you have something to bitch about."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,Tohaba,4,Fri Oct 3 02:04:06 2014 UTC,"You work on cap space, we spent 250k cap + 300k transfer for Mbohli, plus what we paid to bring in Valdes. Where are you finding the money to also bring in a striker? When you have a salary cap it is one or the other."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,violacurva,3,Fri Oct 3 02:05:50 2014 UTC,The salary cap is going way up. Brian carrol makes almost 200k and his contract is up. So right there we will have more than enough to bring in a dp striker if we wish. And we didnt pay anything for valdes so i dont know why you are complaining about that.   Everyone needs to calm down. I remember when brian brown scored against skc the post match thread had people saying he would be an all star. One damn moment doesnt make a soocer player. Rais is a tremendous keeper. Brian brown is not a tremendous striker (not yet at least). Dont define these guys by a single play.   This team isnt going to win a championship this year anyway. If they sneak into the playoffs and get to play 1 extra game thats great. But if not its not the end of the world. We are much better off than this time last year.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,thelostdolphin,1 point,Fri Oct 3 03:00:11 2014 UTC,"We weren't making moves for this season. I mean seriously, what did you think would've happened if we limped into the 5th spot of the playoffs?"
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,3,Fri Oct 3 02:18:53 2014 UTC,"Only our second playoff appearance since we joined MLS? It's been stated numerous times by players, coaching staff, and the FO that their goal was to get back into the playoffs this year.   Here's the thing, every year is becoming a ""building year"" for next year, only next year never seems to come."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Oct 3 05:27:14 2014 UTC,Limping into the playoffs rather than trying to build a contender is why Philly teams are always bad. I'm glad you would sacrifice long term success because you are too impatient and short sighted to recognize a one and done in the playoffs is not more important than building a strong team.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,in_the_against,3,Fri Oct 3 11:47:09 2014 UTC,"Why are the two always mutually exclusive with everyone? At some point we need to see an upward trend. All this ""building a contender"" talk has only ever gotten us ""meh"" results."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,-4,Fri Oct 3 12:49:13 2014 UTC,"And you make the mistake of only focusing on this year. Playoffs were a long shot anyway. Next year is a target year. An upgrade at keeper is better than a panic signing at striker to appease mellowdramatic fans.  Seriously, stop thinking so short term."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,jpoRS,3,Fri Oct 3 02:09:39 2014 UTC,"Except that after our offseason signings a lot of people felt the Union were a team to watch.  we started by under performing and ended by it.    And while I agree that it wasn't one or the other, our front office felt it important sign contracts with 3 starting caliber keepers this year, when for the last 2 seasons we have needed a goal scorer.  It is frustrating."

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,drewuke,6,Fri Oct 3 02:00:26 2014 UTC,"Just to stem the tide of overreaction, what exactly did Curtin do wrong in this 90 minutes?  It the same union as always. No stud scorers."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,arkr,7,Fri Oct 3 02:09:02 2014 UTC,"He moved players back to their natural positions, otherwise he hasn't done anything to really stand out besides not be as bad as Hackworth who set the bar incredibly low.   Part of it is roster deficiencies, I know, but still I don't think he's more than a mediocre coach.  A mediocre coach on a team with holes in the roster giving you a ""meh"" performance on the field... that's been the story of the Union. Besides a couple sparks of what could be, this has been a painfully mediocre team."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,drewuke,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:15:53 2014 UTC,"I agree, but those things were true 2 weeks ago when everyone was annointing him the Lord and savior. I'm just wondering how you blame him for games where the Union are clearly the better team, but have no finisher."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,keystonemike,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:24:21 2014 UTC,"Regression to the mean. The Union have some very good pieces, but they rarely click because we're lacking in some clear areas. Casey and Le Toux went on a tear, but one is old, tired, and inconsistent, and the other isn't a target forward at all. When push comes to shove we don't have a reliable goal scorer. The service is there, the defense is much better, but nobody has a nose for goal."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,drewuke,3,Fri Oct 3 02:34:24 2014 UTC,"1) Put in Hoppenot  2) Where's Pfeffer or Fernandes? Not even in 18.  3) Taking off Maidana while leaving on Fabinho.  4) Starts game with a 4-6-0.  5) Be content with a super flat team. Must-win game? Didn't look like it for 88+ minutes.  6) Showed little change from Hack now that the honeymoon is over.  7) Current Form is D-L-D-L-D  EDIT: I'm not trying to blame Curtin for everything, this is just how I felt he screwed up tonight. Everything was poor tonight, not just the coach. The whole organization needs a reality check, and it can totally happen this offseason. We'll see how that actually goes. I love the team, but let's see the changes, please. Starting with Sak?? Doubt it..."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,marksills,3,Fri Oct 3 02:12:12 2014 UTC,"tbf fernandes had a small hot streak and then shut off, and last time I saw him play he was a non-factor. Pfeffer hasn't impressed me that much when I've seen him play, hes still not quite there. I wouldn't want pfeffer in when the playoffs are on the line.    We don't really have any strikers with le toux and casey out. I mean i guess brian brown, but we all saw how that went. Hoppenot is, but again hes a 'better' option late.   Honestly he is handicap by the team. We have very little offensive power. Our defense has been much better since he took over. We really need a damn striker though. One who can make a play when vince or chaco give him a good ball. Not one who fumbles over the ball until the other teams d is set.  I''m not saying curtain is god. I'd like to bring in someone with some experience and have curtain study under them. I'm just saying he probably doesn't deserve the blame here."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:18:53 2014 UTC,"I know what you are saying, and it's true, but it's same exact thing people said after Hack took Nowak's team. I seriously think it's time to bring in a new guy and let him bring in his staff. No more interim business, I don't know."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,leftyboy87,2,Fri Oct 3 04:30:49 2014 UTC,"I'd love to see pfeffer get more time. But there is no way that Leo or non-hoppenot wins this game.   The real.reason you don't see a lot of difference is because the team is essentially the same. When Cruz is your best option off the bench, there's not much room for tactical flexibility. This is not to say Curtin is the answer, he's just not the problem."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:27:42 2014 UTC,"He's not the problem by any stretch, but we need to fix things instead of taping over them. Well technically the real problem is Sak and Hack was such a really bad coach."

But yea, the honeymoon period is over and were back to playing pretty poor soccer and not getting results. The hackworth situation is basically identical to this and our management is stupid, actually we already knew that even, even stupid than we thought (if possible)"
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,mthslhrookiecard,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:20:41 2014 UTC,With Le Toux and how stale the offense has been I was really hoping to see McLaughlin this game. Curtin hasn't show he can make adjustments once teams have finally figured out the Union's gameplan.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,drewuke,5,Fri Oct 3 02:40:56 2014 UTC,Positivity! I like it.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,akuller,3,Fri Oct 3 02:09:14 2014 UTC,I was really disappointed with Curtin this game.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,MortalSmurph,2,Fri Oct 3 02:38:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah - no aggression shown by Curtain. This game was must win (more or less) yet no move to go balls out. For example, in the 80th he could've gone to 3 at the back by taking off a defender for a forward or pushing up Maidana and moving Edu into midfield. At the very least, he could've had the team press hard core from the beginning.  While the players didn't play with any particular urgency, Curtain did not force/coax it out of them by their setup."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,thetallgiant,2,Fri Oct 3 19:23:26 2014 UTC,We really don't have the players to make those impact subs especially with letoux injured. Curtin had to make some changes so he used what he had. Still though... hoppenot?

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,Wh3resTh3Beef,4,Fri Oct 3 01:59:42 2014 UTC,This sums it up.  There were two Union fans shown after the goal doing expressions like these.  I was watching on WatchESPN and couldn't go back and get a pic/gif of them.

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,arkr,3,Fri Oct 3 04:54:10 2014 UTC,That was seriously one of the worst plays I've ever seen.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:35:25 2014 UTC,"Were you there? If so, do you know roughly where the back line was on the field when the miskick happened?"
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,marksills,2,Fri Oct 3 02:40:13 2014 UTC,"I was there but on the opposite side of the field.  From what I could tell, Union had possession, Chicago was pressing high.  Edu had no options so he dropped it back to M'Bolhi.  The ball was bouncing a little bit, the Chicago guy didn't stop running.  M'Bolhi just panicked.  If he didn't feel comfortable with the ball that's when you just put foot through the ball and boot it long.  That's not when you try a blind chip pass to nobody."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,SirMothy,2,Fri Oct 3 02:50:07 2014 UTC,"It seemed like we were needlessly pressing forward and we should've been parking the bus. If the back line were in position, I don't think the situation would've occurred in the first place. Not excusing the dumb move by M'Bohli, but the whole thing didn't make sense considering we were already into stoppage time."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:54:39 2014 UTC,http://imgur.com/6U3XlPE  It wasn't really the back lines fault. The defender keeping the player onside was in that position because he was being pressed by the furthest up fire player and had to dribble back and pass it to the goalie. The other two were in good position assuming that the ball would be booted far.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,Tohaba,4,Fri Oct 3 03:54:56 2014 UTC,"Our playoff hopes were alive...  for 3 minutes.  Zac has given up some softies, but man that was at the worst possible time.

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:04:02 2014 UTC,Too much money? We pay him less than Ricketts or Perkins. Zac's new contract would set him in the same range.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,marksills,4,Fri Oct 3 11:50:59 2014 UTC,great veteran move there. zac wouldve cleared that shit 20 rows into the stands still cant believe we made that dumb fucking transfer. maybe we shoulda went after a striker instead of a position where we already have 2 very promising players for a position that can only have 1 person for basically a season. We didnt deserve 3 points anyway. And we better not keep curtin
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,SirMothy,5,Fri Oct 3 02:01:19 2014 UTC,"MacMath has cost us points plenty of times with his poor decision making, don't act as if he is Christ Almighty"
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,marksills,-6,Fri Oct 3 02:29:34 2014 UTC,Why do people act as if signing MBolhi meant we didn't sign a striker? Transfers don't work that way.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,SirMothy,5,Fri Oct 3 02:02:12 2014 UTC,"It does when your wasting 400k in 2 goalkeepers in limited cap space. We also bought back Valdes which takes up more space. Because we signed Mbohli we don't have much room to sign a proven striker, and opted for Brown."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,hoax021,-5,Fri Oct 3 02:04:12 2014 UTC,Who is the striker we would gave signed?  You act like there was a clear target when there likely wasn't.  MBolhi still is an upgrade and a longterm signing. Try thinking past this year.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,marksills,4,Fri Oct 3 02:05:32 2014 UTC,"try thinking past this year? when Zac has been improving at a fast rate, Blake has tons of talent, and theres 2 teams with expansions draft this summer"
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,SirMothy,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:24:08 2014 UTC,Zac MacMath makes plenty of mistakes as well let's not forget that.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:30:27 2014 UTC,"i do agree with that but he definitely cut down on them this year, and is 5 years younger"
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,marksills,3,Fri Oct 3 02:31:41 2014 UTC,"GKs are better with age and experience. MacMath gave up a stupid ass penalty in one match where he charged a guy down who was at a terrible angle and well covered by the defense. He let a soft bouncing Henry shot in against NYRB, and these are just ones from this season that I'm remembering off the top of my head."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,4,Fri Oct 3 02:40:07 2014 UTC,not too add macmath has a ceiling and he's pretty much hit it already. he isnt THAT much better compared to last year let's be honest.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,marksills,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:47:35 2014 UTC,"better with age to a certain point. Casillas was on the very top of his game in 2010 when he was 28-29, and has obviously fallen off in the 4 years since then, especially the last 2. obviously hes still a good keeper and people like to judge him off his world cup and CL final, but he's certainly not on the same level as he was in 2010. I feel like Neuer is pretty close to his peak right now. i could be wrong and he could get better, but i cant imagine him being much better than he is now"

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,JerseysFinest,0,Fri Oct 3 02:29:39 2014 UTC,"None of that makes sense.  Zac is not an international level keeper which is the point.  What do Brad Davis and Coutinho have to do anything?  Zac will be traded in the offseason. He can be swapped for money, draft picks, or a player. It's not like he is destined to go during the expansion draft. Besides, he'd be gone anyway with Blake here."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,oooooooounbelievable,5,Fri Oct 3 03:01:00 2014 UTC,"you were saying zac will never be an international keeper, which i agree we can say theres a good chance of that he wont. but thats because he's american, and its much harder to make the national team as a keeper for america than it is for algeria.. hence the brad davis and coutinho analogy, as it is harder to make brazil than america. Also theres no guarantee for a trade, he's been linked a bit with orlando, but why wouldnt they just wait til the draft? Also i highly doubt zac will be offered 240k a year"
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,thakritik,2,Fri Oct 3 03:11:23 2014 UTC,"Rais is better than Rimando, an American World Cup keeper. MacMath is not better than Rimando. Nationality doesn't matter.

I watch Bayern every week and I honestly don't think I've ever seen him fuck up. It's actually scary....  sure people fuck up. But he literally had to just kick as hard as he could. or in any other direction. Zac was here and had a very reasonable salary. I think we paid too much for an upgrade that, quite honestly, hasn't been impressive(bar one game). I hope the future proves me wrong though, we can't judge a signing off of a few games."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,2,Fri Oct 3 02:10:52 2014 UTC,"When Neuer was on Schalke, headed the ball right to Stankovic of Inter when he was well out of the net in the UCL a few seasons back and Inter scored.

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,MortalSmurph,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:41:11 2014 UTC,He is the best keeper in the world bar none. You always expect him to screw something up while wandering out on the pitch but it never happens.

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,MortalSmurph,3,Fri Oct 3 02:20:50 2014 UTC,Have you seen Rais play outside of the Germany v Algeria match at the last World Cup?   I seriously doubt anyone has. He played in fucking Bulgaria before signing with the Union.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:31:28 2014 UTC,"I've watched some other Algerian games.

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,MortalSmurph,3,Fri Oct 3 03:03:13 2014 UTC,"I would probably take Zac tbh. I think he has a huge upside. I could be wrong. I know from these threads that you don't think much of him. Ironically its cause you think he is inconsistent, but I don't think our new keeper has proven himself any more consistent. I wouldn't mind your defending M'bholi so much if you didnt bash Zac for exactly what M'bholi just did...  Also I don't think Zac will make quite that much on his next contract, but its a moot point cause we will never know. Maybe if he signed a 4 year the 4th year would be up there, but I would guess 150-170K."
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,FlapjackJackson,2,Fri Oct 3 02:25:52 2014 UTC,Can Zac ever stonewall Germany.  You are wrong that I don't rate Zac. I was defending him all last year when everyone was throwing him under the bus. I openly think Zac is a good player. I just think MBolhi will be better.  Bill Hamid makes 200k. There is no way Zac makes less than that.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,MortalSmurph,3,Fri Oct 3 02:49:48 2014 UTC,"Upgrading one position a slight amount for $600,000 instead of upgrading several other positions a significant amount isn't a good decision.  Stop spewing this ""When you can upgrade your team, you do"" shit.  It's shit reasoning."

PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,hoax021,4,Fri Oct 3 02:22:44 2014 UTC,"It's not about salary cap.  It's about understanding we are a growing team with a finite amount of money to spend on things.  We spent $400,000 in transfer fees and pay him $200,000.  The exact numbers aren't important.  I would not have spent that money if nothing else was available.  We'd have that much money available for the next transfer period.  Personally, I would be looking at defenders as well as strikers."

You can't think ""Oh the salary cap is going up so I can spend more money.  I can spend that much money every year so I might as well spend it all"".  You have to think ""I only have so much money, how can I best spend it."""
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,hoax021,0,Fri Oct 3 03:06:55 2014 UTC,I really don't get your point. We'd be paying Zac a similiar salary. That money was going to a keeper anyway.  You completely miss the point about the salary cap increase. It will be raising a few million. That's plenty to bring a new striker in. An extra 40k or so spent on Rais vs MacMath isn't suddenly going to make us broke. You are implying an artifical scarcity will keep us from signing someone in the offseason when we will have several million to spend and still have money left over.
PhillyUnion,2i5fhg,mthslhrookiecard,3,Fri Oct 3 03:22:17 2014 UTC,The salary cap being raise is NOT the same as the Philadelphia Union having more money to spend.  How do you not fucking understand this concept?   You completely miss the point about the salary cap increase. It will be raising a few million. That's plenty to bring a new striker in.    No.  This is completely wrong.  That means that we are ALLOWED to spend more money.  That doesn't mean that we will HAVE more money.

Which to you treat first, the ankle or the gunshot wound?   Signing Rais when we had such glaring deficiencies elsewhere on the roster is akin to treating the sprain while letting your patient bleed out. So he was available? So what?

Most available strikers would not have been much of an upgrade. There is no point of bringing in a journeyman who can score 5 goals a year in a season in which we would only get bounced im the first round of the playoffs anyway.  This team still needs work. Zac is set for a new contract that will put him close to MBolhi's salary. We sign a better keeper than Zac for a little more than we would pay him, swap him for assets in the offseason, and sign a striker who can actually help this team in the offseason.  That will make this team a challenger, not panic buying a subpar striker."

It's become incredibly demoralizing to watch those come to nothing so frequently. Especially the near post to Casey for a skimmer.   Now with that aside, I watched Chicago/Houston. Chicago is not good and are ripe to be plundered for the full 3 points. I don't care how it gets done, Cruz, Hoppenot, hell even Corben Bone. But it has to be a win, anything else is season over for the Union.  I want to see the intensity that the Open Cup Final brought out of these guys.

PhillyUnion,2hzggo,EdBacon,1 point,Wed Oct 1 16:54:42 2014 UTC,There is a degree of burnout when you rely on Casey as your target forward. He's really only in form for a very brief period of time anymore. Falling back on your midfielders and rookie strikers is never optimal.
PhillyUnion,2hyoik,M4_doop,2,Wed Oct 1 04:40:01 2014 UTC,Take the subway to 30th Street Station (BSL north to MFL west) and catch the Wilmington/Newark line to Chester Transportation Center. There are shuttle buses that will drop you off at the stadium.
PhillyUnion,2hyoik,EdBacon,2,Wed Oct 1 15:35:42 2014 UTC,"There is a bus that runs from Brauhaus Schmitz - $25, and includes beer.  They also have a few free tickets they are giving away."

PhillyUnion,2hxn9z,LocksTheFox,9,Tue Sep 30 22:28:09 2014 UTC,It sounds like he was asked a question point blank about whether he'll consider using Hopenot and he said he's worthy of consideration and someone he may use. That could just be not selling out people on his squad to the press. What's he supposed to say there?
PhillyUnion,2hxn9z,thelostdolphin,5,Wed Oct 1 00:56:26 2014 UTC,"::face palm::  I liked Hoppenot, but he's become a diver and I lost a decent amount of respect for him because of this.  He used to be good as a high energy sub, but I don't think he's the answer for any of our problems."
PhillyUnion,2hxn9z,midwesternhousewives,2,Tue Sep 30 23:27:59 2014 UTC,I dont think any of the forwards we have are the correct answer if we're determined to stick with a 4-2-3-1.
PhillyUnion,2hxn9z,emptythecache,2,Wed Oct 1 15:14:49 2014 UTC,"I might get blasted for this...But Hackworth may have been right that this team fits best in a 4-3-3. The issue we had was his incompetence at putting players in the right positions.  Rais in goal and a back four of Gaddis, Valdes, Edu, and Williams. Midfield of Amobi, Noguiera, and Chaco. Wenger on the left, Le Toux on the right, Casey in the middle up top."
PhillyUnion,2hxn9z,emptythecache,2,Wed Oct 1 17:59:03 2014 UTC,"That's our best 11 now, but our best 11 are not consistently dangerous in the attack. Even when you have someone really good at that lone hold-up striker role, it's not that high scoring a role. You rely on a more attacking midfield, which sometimes the Union has, and sometimes they don't.  Casey is not the answer in that he's on his very very last legs. We stopped our striker search this summer because Casey was having an uncharacteristic run of form, which is insane to me. He has two goals since the middle of July, both against a flailing Toronto with a cobbled together back line. Since this summer, he has mostly looked several steps too slow for the game. Too slow to be able to check back to collect and get in a dangerous position on the same play.  The 4-3-3 has always actually been a 4-2-3-1 for the Union. The three midfielders all pinch into the middle leaving the wingers defensive responsibilities."
PhillyUnion,2hxn9z,in_the_against,1 point,Wed Oct 1 19:17:57 2014 UTC,"As I've said in the past, I think the Union should go after Cubo Torres or Claudio Bieler this offseason. Both would be optimal but would require us to not buy Edu"

PhillyUnion,2hocww,KRoadKid,6,Sun Sep 28 05:17:29 2014 UTC,"My preferred way to get to/from games is via a bus that picks up and drops off at a bar on South Street called Brauhaus Schmitz.  You sign up on their website to ride the bus (its $25USD, but totally worth it).  Have a beer or two with some Union fans, and upon boarding the bus, they provide you with all the beer you can drink on the trip to and from.  It pretty much pays for itself with the drinks as parking at PPL Park is $20.  As far as tickets, buy them online here.  You're gonna want to sit with the Sons of Ben in sections 134-140 in the river end.  There's really not a bad seat in the house as it's one level of seating, plus the river end atmosphere makes spectating a blast.  Hope this helps, if you have any questions about the bus, the pub, the stadium or anything else, feel free to DM me and i'd be glad to help!  Welcome to Philly & C'mon the U!

PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,drayb3,12,Sat Sep 27 20:54:47 2014 UTC,We have 11 good players.  We need about 15.
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,in_the_against,3,Sat Sep 27 21:01:21 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure that's the most accurate description of this team's problem. We have 11 good players, but two of them are keepers, we've got three central defenders, and three defensive mids. Throw in Maidana, LeToux, and Wenger and we're full up without a single striker, LB, or RB in the bunch."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,3,Sun Sep 28 04:47:16 2014 UTC,are you discounting gaddis or williams? Gaddis has been very good this year and shaneon was our best player last year
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,marksills,1 point,Sun Sep 28 18:40:08 2014 UTC,"I think I counted Gaddis as a central defender. It was late, I was tired. He plays LB often enough, but that has had more to do with the fact that we had no one else to put there. And Williams was good last year, but he hasn't played much this year, and when he has he hasn't been great."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,1 point,Sun Sep 28 19:29:44 2014 UTC,"i do agree that williams hasnt been very good this year, but i wouldnt not call him not a good player. i guess if youre talking about just this year, you may be right. just semantics. but i wouldnt give up on him, jsut cause this year, he's been good in the past and elevated his game more last year. not sure what it is this year, maybe he lost confidence after playing poor after his injury? idk"
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,marksills,1 point,Mon Sep 29 03:15:13 2014 UTC,"I'm not giving up on him, I'm just saying I don't have the same confidence I have in the other guys I mentioned. I hope we don't lose him in the expansion draft, but were I Curtin I'm not sure I'd burn a protection spot on him."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,1 point,Mon Sep 29 03:43:52 2014 UTC,"hmmm i see what youre saying. I've always been really high on him, but he hasnt been great this year. I do think it's getting a bit exaggerated by a lot of people but i get where youre coming from. Personally i'd definitely burn an expansion spot on him, but we'll see. I think when the season comes to an end we definitely should have a discussion on who gets protected on this sub. There's no way we can keep 3 goalies no?"
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,marksills,1 point,Mon Sep 29 03:59:41 2014 UTC,"No, and Zach will probably get the short of it. M'Bolhi is an improvement, though only an incremental one, and Blake is on a Generation Adidas contract so he is (probably) exempt. A dream scenario would be to ditch Blake somehow, but I'm not sure it's fair to MacMath to make him ride the bench at such a crucial part of his career, nor does it make fiscal sense to pay what he deserves to a backup keeper."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,1 point,Mon Sep 29 04:11:41 2014 UTC,this is why i didnt like the mbolhi move. i liked zac and thought hed been good this year and im very high on blake.
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,marksills,1 point,Mon Sep 29 05:14:44 2014 UTC,"Eh. When the M'Bolhi deal was in the making MacMath was still unreliable. He's always had great games, but they were intermixed with games where he made poor decisions that directly harmed the Union. I don't blame the FO for wanting someone more reliable and more experienced, especially with how off our defense was for the first half of the season. If you look at it, MacMath only got better around the time the M'Bolhi deal would have been closing, and there is no way the FO could have known this wasn't just another MacMath hot streak.  Now with the clarity of hindsight it is obvious that Zac finally has his shit figured out and is going to be great, but ""unfortunately"" we've signed Rais so it is what it is. The silver lining here is that MacMath now has some trade value, so he won't just be left on an iceberg.  Out of curiosity, what has Blake done to earn your trust? I know I was excited we got a mini-Ricketts, but since then it's become clear there is a bit of a gap on Jamaica's depth chart."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,7,Mon Sep 29 14:10:51 2014 UTC,"can we just stop starting conor casey? i'd rather see pedro or even brown getting those minutes. im sorry but casey is so useless...his headers are poor, hes slow as fuck, worst 1st touch possible everytime and always a 60 min sub. having said that, we suck. i love chaco but sometimes he just plays too slow. nog was a beast again for the most part. rais was also quite good in net."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,hoax021,5,Sat Sep 27 23:22:23 2014 UTC,I really was hoping for some playoff soccer.. We blow. Lets make a bid for Cubo Torres or Gilberto
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,cjd5286,4,Sat Sep 27 23:02:41 2014 UTC,"The team clearly lacks a finisher. We're passable on the counter-attack, but don't have the right player up top to finish off the service provided. Way too many chances go begging, and they are quality chances, unlike the hopeful balls being played in at the beginning of the season. This really needs to be addressed. Teams know they can give us possession and defend easily as we are without any serious threat in the box.   Also, I bet you ten bucks Curtin is confirmed as head coach Monday following this loss."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,EdBacon,3,Sat Sep 27 23:03:25 2014 UTC,"Whoever is named the coach in the offseason I hope realizes the need for a striker and more depth overall. This team has repeatedly said that we were a ""deep"" team the last few years, and I don't think it could be more obvious that we're not than the past two weeks. When Brian Brown (who is a project) and Pedro Ribeiro (who is a Midfielder) are your backup forwards, there's a problem."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,pefsu13,7,Sun Sep 28 01:37:23 2014 UTC,"Well any chance of playoffs is now gone in my opinion. Time to build for next year and hope none of our starters get swooped in the expansion draft. Besides Ribeiro I honestly don't care if any of our bench gets taken. Orlando/NYC please take Cruz and Carroll, please."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,Keepa1,4,Sat Sep 27 21:13:28 2014 UTC,"I'm not writing off the playoffs, it isn't like Columbus or TFC are know for clutch play. But I am not expecting much if we do make it."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,2,Sat Sep 27 21:22:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah we're not out of the playoffs yet. A road point against dc was sure to be tough, and union were going for the win and not trying to play out a draw.   While our chances are a lot lower now, I wouldn't say we're out yet."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Sun Sep 28 14:53:45 2014 UTC,"Also, before yesterday I wouldn't have given up on a deep playoff run. But with LeToux down, and the struggles against DC (and Houston, and New York) I'm not convinced.   That said, with the first half of the season we had even being in the conversation about playoffs is a huge success. And if Curtin is as good in the off-season as he has been in-season? And a new CBA opens up the money for a striker? People better watch out."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,3,Sun Sep 28 15:11:40 2014 UTC,I'd like to see the Union pick up Bieler or Cubo Torres this offseason
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,LocksTheFox,2,Sun Sep 28 02:52:16 2014 UTC,Oh god imagine getting both of them. i would lay $ down that we win the cup in 2015.
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,Keepa1,3,Mon Sep 29 00:05:41 2014 UTC,"Jesus Christ. And if we let Edu's loan expire we'd have two DP slots open (both are DPs)...  make it happen, someone. (I like Mo, I just think Okugo's got more upside and is cheaper, and I don't want to play him out of position when White and Berry are capable CBs)"
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Sep 29 00:35:37 2014 UTC,agreed.
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,Keepa1,3,Mon Sep 29 00:38:43 2014 UTC,"So with those two, our XI would be something along the lines of Rais, Williams, Valdes, one of White or Berry, Gaddis, Nogueira, Okugo, Maidana, Bieler, Torres, and one of Wenger or Le Toux.  Holy shit."
PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,LocksTheFox,3,Mon Sep 29 00:41:05 2014 UTC,"all stars baby. I'd love to have a team that just never has trouble scoring goals and putting the game on their opposition, like Seattle and LA."

PhillyUnion,2hn7ll,jpoRS,1 point,Sat Sep 27 21:20:37 2014 UTC,It was in the weird sun/shade area and he was closer to the right post when it seemingly deflected towards the guy to head it into the leftish corner. No one is saving that.
PhillyUnion,2hma4s,midwesternhousewives,5,Sat Sep 27 14:50:22 2014 UTC,"This could be a backbreaker if the Union loses, and a tie would be barely any better. Sure it will be a hard game, but the playoffs won't be any easier.   That said, if the team shows up for this game it is winnable and it could be the start of a rally that carries them deep into the playoffs.  Is it possible for a team that is undefeated in five to ""rally""?  Good luck at the match, [joke about raccoons]."

PhillyUnion,2he0x9,peewoah1,8,Thu Sep 25 01:36:37 2014 UTC,If I were going for Bethlehem Steel I think I would pull in more then black/white Union. Example would be iconic I-beam of corp or the B from Steel team.

Incorporated the iconic I-beam.  Also was able to add red as the accent color by doing this. No more Union logo hopefully means less clutter. Kept the Union snake, because there needs to be something Union related...after all, this is still a Union logo, just stylized after BSFC."
PhillyUnion,2he0x9,FlashKelly,7,Sat Sep 27 02:48:52 2014 UTC,It's very cluttered
PhillyUnion,2he0x9,MorphineSmile,2,Thu Sep 25 04:07:48 2014 UTC,"To expand on this, very little of the ""Bethlehem"" element is present in the lower field.  It seems only the black and white scheme is doing that.  Maybe consider playing around with the BSFC logo?  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I421t3WYgBA/UO3zwcFdMsI/AAAAAAAANxk/kK_bIeq1A30/s1600/BethlehemSteelFC.jpg  Otherwise, I like the concept, just agree it's a little too ""busy"" and could be further refined.    EDIT:  in the Union mod that made the rounds, the snake overlapped the diagonal line.  Maybe consider ""borrowing"" from the upper field in a similar manner?"

Sak doesn't know what to do and wanted to test the fan reaction.  The reaction seems to have been basically ""now?"" so he pulled back.  If the Union do announce him as full time manager in the next day or two it's because Meulensteen has gotten tired of waiting and decided to pursue options elsewhere thus making Curtin the only real option remaining. The Union not wanting to risk Curtin walking for a better offer offers him the contract.  Personally, as soon as Curtin was named interim I thought he would end up with the job.  But I didn't foresee myself being totally fine with that decision.  I think I would wait till the end of the year before making a final decision but if the rumored list of final candidates are true, I think Curtin is my guy no matter what unless he pulls a Hackworth down the stretch or something."

I just feel that a large collection of us (myself included) think he, and the team, would benefit more from learning under the likes of Meulensteen or Moyes.  Another disadvantage to Curtin at this point is his name.  No one outside the MLS will likely have heard of him. Meulensteen or Moyes?  Those are guys who can bring players in just on their name alone.  For instance, Robin van Persie would be much more inclined to play for Meulensteen than Curtin.  Personally, if I was Curtin, I would have begged Sak to hire one of those guys.  That is the opportunity of a lifetime for someone like him to learn his trade from coaches of their caliber."

PhillyUnion,2gzx8e,mthslhrookiecard,8,Mon Sep 22 13:37:40 2014 UTC,This game provides the strongest case of the season on why this team is in need of a pure finisher. Casey completely surpassed my expectations and proves hes a threat with the his headers and strength but he moves like a freight truck on ice. Wenger has shown great potential as a LW or a RW. Casey isnt gonna be around much longer this team needs a big prescene up front and we are playoff caliber.
PhillyUnion,2gzx8e,MrChips217,1 point,Sun Sep 21 01:35:30 2014 UTC,"Wenger becoming a genuine presence opens a lot of things up for the future, but you're right.

You're right about Casey though, it's not that I don't like him, the problem is that with LeToux and Wenger on the wings our offense has a lot of pace and that often leaves them stuck down in the corner waiting for Casey to catch up to the play which means the other teams defense is also catching up."

PhillyUnion,2gzx8e,FlapjackJackson,5,Sun Sep 21 12:55:25 2014 UTC,"That was the first Union game ever in which the opponent came out in a defensive shell afraid of our attack.

PhillyUnion,2gzx8e,thewizardofosmium,1 point,Sun Sep 21 07:31:37 2014 UTC,"I thought we should have seen Ribiero on a bit earlier. He, at least,  provided a bit of pace up top which is what we needed to break through Houston's CB pairing.  The two curled through balls near he end of the match,  one of which Pedro put off the post, were what we needed to be doing for most of game.  The long balls to Casey weren't working and he really doesn't offer another style."

PhillyUnion,2gymu1,notafool,3,Sat Sep 20 16:44:31 2014 UTC,"First, let me say that I like Curtin. He has really done well to instill defensive discipline, especially on set pieces. He also has done well going forward, however it wasn't anything magical. As many people contended from week 3 in the season, the problems of using 3/4 defensive midfielders, playing Nogueira as a number 10, and emphasizing possession just didn't fit this team's personnel. (Ironically, Hackworth was the one stockpiling the talent, so you wonder what he was really thinking.) Curtin simplified the Union game plan and plays to his players' strengths.  Does this mean he should be the manager going forward? I'm not so sure... I'd like to have more clarity about who is making decisions on player acquisition. I'd also like to see if he can get the first 11 some rest. I don't just want to make the playoffs, I want to make a run."

I want to see a fresh face free from the Nowak/Hackworth Era. That being said I do like what he has done and really really really want him to be Assistant Coach.   The way the players respond to him is visibly better than when Hackworth and Nowak were at the helm and I really think keeping him in the organization is important."

PhillyUnion,2gutjw,hoax021,2,Fri Sep 19 12:54:11 2014 UTC,"We have 6 games left. It'll likely take 50 points to secure a playoff spot. We need to get 13 of the available 18 to make it. Houston, Chicago, and Columbus home are all must win games. We need to go 1-1-1 in DC away, Columbus away, and SKC in addition to get to that magic 50. This will also get us, hopefully, 4 points out of 6 against Columbus, and get us our spot. Assuming we beat Houston today, we should be above the line, as RBNY is not getting 3 points in Seattle. Columbus has a tough match against red hot BBFC. Ideally, I'd like the U to end in 4th place, to play the play in game at home vs the Pink Cows. That also sets up a Semifinal vs D.C. United, with the first match at PPL. Let NE and SKC duke it out, and we can play the bloodied victor.  That path starts today. Nothing less than 3 points is acceptable today."

PhillyUnion,2gutjw,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Sat Sep 20 19:08:28 2014 UTC,"On #6. To me it looks like Ribeiro doesn't quite have the reads down to start at forward just yet. However, I think he's learning fast. I'd like to see him deeper since I think that's a more natural position for him. No not CB deep. Maybe as a swap in for Maidana who has to be beat after Tuesday.   I'm not sure what to make of Brown in the little bits we've seen of him so far. My uneducated tactical gut tells me he might be better suited to a 4-4-2.  PPL on Tuesday was electric, raucous and amazing. Best I've ever seen or experienced. Even with that bitter loss, it's bound to be a lifelong memory."

PhillyUnion,2gpglo,Syaoran89,1 point,Thu Sep 18 10:48:40 2014 UTC,Because his strong suit is developing young talent much more so than functioning as a head coach. He could serve in the role he's made his mark in and also be an advisor and mentor to Curtin in a similar fashion.

PhillyUnion,2gmed7,xxtoejamfootballxx,6,Wed Sep 17 02:31:06 2014 UTC,Agreed on Brown over Ribeiro. I don't think playing up top is really Riberio's strongest place on the pitch though. Maybe we'll be seeing more of Brown coming up because of it.

They played with true grit and determination (not to mention heart), and you could tell how much this meant to them by how they played. They actually looked really good out there tonight, and I couldn't have asked for anything more from the boys in blue.  But truth be told, we had 3 opportunities to win this thing in the dying minutes of regulation time. It's just a shame that they couldn't get the ball into the back of the net...  It's a disappointing result but they played with their hearts on their sleeve and I love them regardless. DOOP"
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,OshiHidra,15,Wed Sep 17 02:35:02 2014 UTC,"Proud of the Union. They played hard and made chances, but sadly none were capitalized on. Seattle did what the Union could not do and that was take the chances they had. I will say that for some reason I really developed a dislike towards Seattle I did not have before."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,mc_hannpn,13,Wed Sep 17 02:18:36 2014 UTC,"I really got the underdog mentality. It'll feel kind of cheap if Seattle becomes a near guarantee to go top of the table like they seem to be. MLS is supposed to have parity, but its hard when teams can spend like Seattle.   Money brings wins, which bring fans, which brings more money. It's a vicious cycle. I mean I don't blame Seattle fans. Every team wants to be in that situation. But its hard not to feel bitter being on the outside.   Still, I'm probably the happiest with the Union as I've ever been right now."

I think the subs were bad... i think MacMath was bad (distribution was god awful and 3rd goal was on him) and Maidana didn't have his best game when we desperately needed him to... Other than that I really was happy with the dedication and passion.   One thing I really missed was the atmosphere. I watched on a tv in a bar in San Diego and they couldn't play the sound. Someone please tell me we drowned out the ECS for 120+ minutes? They couldn't stop showing the bastards on TV..."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,B4kstabr,5,Wed Sep 17 04:17:04 2014 UTC,"Atmosphere-wise: for the full 90', we really did make some noise. Not just the river end, but occasionally it seemed like the entire stadium was on their feet and shouting.   That said, after the second sounders goal, things got really quiet. I was in 101, and it seemed like the ECS were louder than the SoBs...my stomach kinda dropped. Then of course you have the mass ""beat the traffic"" exodus. I dunno, as tough as it was, I feel like if anything we should be making MORE of a ruckus when we're down (but still in it!) in a game like this. Even if it's difficult."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Wed Sep 17 05:34:11 2014 UTC,"I feel like it's worth mentioning that only half of the River End has leaders for chants. If you're sitting in sections 134-136, the enthusiasm can sometimes get lost. For instance, last night I could barely hear our drum, and getting cohesive chants together was difficult across the sections. There were moments where the River End had two different chants going at the same time because one half can't hear the other. Additionally, many people buy tickets in these areas as they are ""cheap seats"", and often they can be very quiet. So, while visually the River End looks massive, often times much of the noise is only made from half of the people."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,FlapjackJackson,2,Wed Sep 17 15:24:07 2014 UTC,"I came here to say the same about Nogueira. Especially toward the end of the game he was all over the place. I dont know how many times he took the ball off a Sounders player.  As far as atmosphere, it was great. I was in 130 and the only time the ECS was louder was after the goals. I think the only time I have heard a Doop like that was when Roger Torres came off the bench to score against NYRB."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,Dean_Moriarty,6,Wed Sep 17 13:37:43 2014 UTC,"sounders fan. amazing game guys. your starting XI is amazing. more depth and you guys rock it next season, shit you're already rocking it this season.  if we dont win the MLS cup. i think you guys will."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,FlapjackJackson,4,Wed Sep 17 06:29:06 2014 UTC,Gutting loss.  So close and so dominant for long stretches of the game.  So close to our first trophy.  So close to CCL.  So close to rubbing it in the noses of RBNY.  Now we really need to make some noise in the playoffs.
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,Maddog24,6,Wed Sep 17 02:32:37 2014 UTC,"Seattle outplayed us.  We had Connor have to play scared because every time he went for the ball got called a foul.  Those refs allowed them to lay on the ground with no medic calls at the end.  But goddamn we need to shoot the ball from the middle of the box.  Too many piddling tossarounds.  And maidana just seemed to be out tonight.  It was great to watch and that bounce off the crossbar at the end of the 2nd half was just killer.  But the crowd was there, they were loud, and I am proud to be a part of the union."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,FlapjackJackson,8,Wed Sep 17 02:39:12 2014 UTC,"I feel really down about this. They could have won.  I don't blame Curtin but I think he made three big mistakes that if done differently might have brought home the cup.  1.) The Cruz for Wenger sub.  Wenger was still going strong (Le Toux was the one who looked gassed), and Cruz looked bad when coming on.  That sub really took us down a level and did not have to be made.  2.)  Edu-Valdes should have been the CB pairing, and Okugo-Nogueira the CM pairing. White was solid defensively, but even more so than other games his distribution was off.  Not that White was responsible for any of the goals nor did he have a bad game, but Edu is much better with the ball out of the back than White is.  It's the cup final, put out your best 11.  3.)  We needed another attacking option off the bench.  There is no need to have Okugo, Carroll and Lahoud on the bench.  I know Brown has been a bit lackluster in his last few appearances, but he would have been great to bring on after going down in extra time instead of Fred."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,Maddog24,3,Wed Sep 17 03:24:03 2014 UTC,Brown couldn't get on the bench since we already had 5 foreign players.

PhillyUnion,2gmed7,keystonemike,2,Wed Sep 17 19:36:05 2014 UTC,"If you have a green card or are a citizen, you count as a domestic. So players like Fred, Lahoud, and Seba do not count."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,drewuke,0,Wed Sep 17 20:11:28 2014 UTC,"Oh, he plays for Sierra Leone, is he dual citizenship?  I think I still would have had Brown over Fred. Fred is more of a midfield backup rather than a scoring threat but at least not having anyone else on the bench is more understandable then."

I guess that really only leaves Wheeler and Hoppenot as the only other forwards on the team but Hoppenot is with HCI, not sure where Wheeler is. He has disappeared since Curtin took over.  Not thrilled about Wheeler but there has to be someone instead of a third CDM to put on the bench."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,xfactorx69x,1 point,Wed Sep 17 14:33:26 2014 UTC,"Your third point is the only complaint I have about last night.  We gave ourselves no chance to tactically make an offensive move.    I felt bad watching Okugo pace back and forth, but there was no need to sub in a CDM, and we had three on the bench."

PhillyUnion,2gmed7,mthslhrookiecard,3,Wed Sep 17 04:23:13 2014 UTC,"Heartbreaking. That was without a doubt the best crowd I've experienced at PPL. The boys really didn't play a bad game, but they just missed some great opportunities to score. They need to find a quality striker this off-season. They also just need more depth in general. You could see that Seattle has a much deeper squad as the match progressed. They brought Martins and Marco Papa off the bench, while Philly had Danny Cruz, a rookie, and Fred."

PhillyUnion,2gmed7,4-1-3-2,2,Wed Sep 17 02:28:30 2014 UTC,"Well. We played very well. Their first goal was a typical ""leaving people open"" defensive flop but that has become less frequent of late, shame it popped back up tonight. I'm not pleased, but I'm not unhappy."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,hoax021,2,Wed Sep 17 02:33:21 2014 UTC,"Also...with this loss, wonder if Curtin gets the permanent gig. I seriously doubt it, tactically"
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,squid919,2,Wed Sep 17 02:58:46 2014 UTC,"So close. The first two Seattle goals could have been avoided, which makes me feel a bit worse. They Union were lucky to get away with so many turnovers in their own half, and really poor clearances in the box, until Barrett got his goal. On Dempsey's goal, both White and Valdes were tracking Martins, and Gaddis totally blows covering Dempsey. Disappointing to think had those two mistakes not happened we would have a trophy right now"
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,thewizardofosmium,2,Wed Sep 17 11:24:05 2014 UTC,"I don't really understand White at CB, instead of Edu at CB and Okugo at CDM."
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,hoax021,3,Wed Sep 17 14:31:21 2014 UTC,White is an ok defender but his clearances and pass distribution is very bad. he really doesnt deserve to start over Edu at CB leaving okugo on the bench
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,hoax021,2,Wed Sep 17 18:03:28 2014 UTC,"Disheartening, but we (the crowd) were incredible as always (especially for the big matches).  It's a shame the players couldn't go that extra little bit - they were right there. Nog's miss off the post killed me! That said, we can't really ask for too much more. I would have liked to see Brown in place of Ribeiro, but it's all speculation at this point."

Now lets shift all of that into our play push. DOOP"
PhillyUnion,2gmed7,dokool,1 point,Wed Sep 17 03:03:18 2014 UTC,"Another game changer was Valdes' injury.  He looked pretty immobile for most of the game and it was no mistake that Seattle attacked his side at the beginning of the 2nd half.  His resulting poor clearance led to the goal.  And if he wasn't hurt, then he has no excuse for playing so woodenly.  Agree with the other post that Wenger should have stayed in."

If we don't spend smartly on the actual team we'll be in this consistently mediocre cycle that we've been in.
PhillyUnion,2gmoy8,TaeKurmulti,2,Wed Sep 17 17:34:59 2014 UTC,We... just challenged for a title last night. Unless you don't consider the USOC big enough.   And right now we have a legitimate shot at making the playoffs even after being bottom of the table under Hackworth.

PhillyUnion,2gmoy8,swamady,1 point,Fri Sep 19 02:02:15 2014 UTC,"A big name would bring experience mainly. Someone like Meulensteen coached the youth and reserve squads of Manchester United before being the direct assistant coach to legendary Sir Alex Ferguson.  Someone like Moyes has experience working on a tight budget in Everton where he helped turn a team that was very close to relegation for a number of years into a top say 5 or 6 team in the EPL which is no small feat with the amount of money and talent absorbed by the big 4 over there.  A manager of a higher caliber, the Moyes' and Meulensteen's of the world for instance, can potentially force the owners to spend more as well, otherwise why the hell would you sign them if you're not going to listen to anything they say/want/need to coach a winning team?"

He can take it, but he was getting beat up tonight, Marshall was goon. The ref did nothing to stop it.  Even Ribeiro kept trying to hold the ball up but was getting bear hugged and not getting a single call, really poor job by the ref I thought."
PhillyUnion,2gmhaa,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Wed Sep 17 03:35:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it was pretty bad. Marshall got away with holding both of Casey's arms at the same time."
PhillyUnion,2gmhaa,wannabebullwinkle,5,Thu Sep 18 10:48:57 2014 UTC,"I was at the game, in both incidents he had been fouled really aggressively right before and the ref did shit. The ref was atrocious (for both sides), I honestly couldn't tell you what a foul was tonight. The first thing that ticked him off was a full on round the neck slam directly in front of the ref, how he missed it is beyond me.  That being said, dude has to keep his composure."
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,h2g242,12,Wed Sep 17 02:34:13 2014 UTC,I thought he did very well and could have probably put the Union through had the game reached PKs. It's a tough result but he doesn't deserve the hate.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,dokool,12,Wed Sep 17 02:49:21 2014 UTC,"What? No. Absolutely not -- he played with immense poise tonight (something most keepers his age wouldn't be able to do) and he kept us alive countless times. He actually did really well tonight, even though that may not show in the result. It's not his fault we couldn't convert offensive chances at the other end.."
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,digiskunk,1 point,Wed Sep 17 02:44:29 2014 UTC,His decision making on the third goal is inexcusable.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,FlapjackJackson,-3,Wed Sep 17 17:36:58 2014 UTC,His distribution was shit and he almost gifted two goals. The first and third goal were saveable too.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,Sr_Johansson,2,Wed Sep 17 04:00:57 2014 UTC,I wouldn't call his distribution shit but it was certainly lacking. As for the goals I would agree the 3rd was probably savable but he did make a number of spectacular saves earlier. I put that first Seattle goal on the defense more than him. All in all I'd say he had a solid performance.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,Tmmybrbr,1 point,Wed Sep 17 08:46:29 2014 UTC,"The first goal nobody went up for the ball, they let Seattle have the header uncontested in the box. Then it turned to slop and Seattle got lucky.  Second goal, Gaddis should have been on Dempsey. No excuse for 3 guys to go to the ball leaving Dempsey open.  Third was savable for sure, but credit to martins for sneaking a nice one in."

PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,mthslhrookiecard,1 point,Wed Sep 17 12:44:05 2014 UTC,He had a few flubs but his delivery wasn't terrible. What was bad is our inability to win balls in the air but that's not anything new.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,FlapjackJackson,0,Wed Sep 17 13:36:17 2014 UTC,He still kicks it out just as much as he did as a rookie.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,mthslhrookiecard,1 point,Wed Sep 17 15:11:58 2014 UTC,"The first goal there were two Sounders standing wide open a couple feet in front of the net after he'd already made a save, I'm not sure what else you think he could have done..."

PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,ChefJim27,4,Wed Sep 17 15:11:26 2014 UTC,"I don't think he played himself out of a job at all. They were riding the US Open Cup horse that got them there. He lost his job when they signed M'Bolhi. Tonight's result, either way, wouldn't have changed that."
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,drewuke,4,Wed Sep 17 03:28:10 2014 UTC,"Looks like he'll get passed on the depth chart by M'Bolhi, but he definitely did not play himself out of the job. People needa chill."
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,-smokeandmirrors-,3,Wed Sep 17 03:52:57 2014 UTC,He certainly didn't play so bad he lost the job but the writing was on the wall when M'Bolhi signed that he probably won't be with the team after this year.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,CouldBeBetterForever,3,Wed Sep 17 03:06:54 2014 UTC,He's out of a job anyway. We didn't sign Rais to sit on the bench.
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,Dean_Moriarty,3,Wed Sep 17 12:14:12 2014 UTC,"Hopefully.  He looked lost on several shots, and the third goal was 100 percent his fault.  His decision making has always been questionable, and it's not getting better."
PhillyUnion,2gmg7s,phiberoptick,2,Wed Sep 17 17:37:28 2014 UTC,"He could have played out of his mind tonight and it still would be M'Bolhi's job.  But I thought Zac played really well, maybe a few really nice saves and looked confident in general.  My only complaint is that he shouldn't have left his line on the third goal.  The ball was going away from net and Gaddis was right on Martin's shoulder.  It would have taken a hell of a shot  from Martin's across his body at full speed if Zac was in position, instead by coming off his line he gave Martin the option of a little chip."

PhillyUnion,2gleyb,theshankm,3,Tue Sep 16 20:40:09 2014 UTC,no
PhillyUnion,2gleyb,Tmmybrbr,1 point,Tue Sep 16 22:13:27 2014 UTC,"As far as I know, no stadiums anywhere allow this."

PhillyUnion,2gkfyo,ponte95ma,1 point,Tue Sep 16 15:38:05 2014 UTC,What is this? Where? More details please.
PhillyUnion,2gkfyo,Dean_Moriarty,2,Tue Sep 16 19:46:19 2014 UTC,Whoops -- Reddit swallowed the link:    https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=M2dhdXZic29qNTNscWthOGgxNDY1Mmg0NzAgYW1hdmVyaWZ5QG0&ctz=America/New_York

PhillyUnion,2gkv7u,FlashKelly,1 point,Tue Sep 16 17:50:31 2014 UTC,I received my e-mail with the tickets attached the same day as I ordered them back in August. You may want to call the ticket office.
PhillyUnion,2gkv7u,mmccl267,1 point,Tue Sep 16 20:03:59 2014 UTC,"I am having trouble too, and of course the ticket office isn't answering calls...!!!"
PhillyUnion,2gkv7u,timofree,1 point,Tue Sep 16 20:19:56 2014 UTC,"Are you having problems actually print them out?  If so, it's something on your end, but don't worry, you can just pull the PDF up on your phone and scan it that way.  If you haven't received your tickets, they most like went to spam.  See if you can find them in there.  The e-mail is titled Print At Home ticket confirmation and it is from customerservice@neweratickets.com.  If you can't find it, keep calling the office.  If you cannot get through, just get down to the game early and explain the situation at the box office.  At worst, they will charge you to re-print your tickets at the door which I believe is $5, but they'd probably do it for free if you just explained everything nicely."

PhillyUnion,2gkp4l,Tmmybrbr,1 point,Tue Sep 16 18:35:59 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. I won't be a jerk, I'm in their city. Luckily I have a local who is going to be spending the weekend with me in the city so I can see some of it.   I'll look into getting some seats over there than. :) Thanks for the answer. :) Maybe if you'll be there we can get a beer. It won't be hard to see me. I'll be decked out in complete team autographed jersey w/ other gear. :-D"
PhillyUnion,2gkp4l,drewuke,1 point,Tue Sep 16 19:07:27 2014 UTC,"You'll be fine, don't sweat it, I don't think any Crew fans made the trip last time I was at a Crew-Union game, so you probably could just sit anywhere you'd like as there won't be too much of a designated section.   Parking is 20 in official lots, by the way."
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,FlapjackJackson,7,Mon Sep 15 20:58:51 2014 UTC,"I, for one, love what Seattle and its fans are doing for the popularity and relevance of the league. That said, I'd love it even more to beat them."
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,theshankm,1 point,Tue Sep 16 02:01:02 2014 UTC,I'm really looking forward to hanging this over their heads when they wax poetic about how superior the Cascadia culture is.
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,jpoRS,1 point,Tue Sep 16 02:10:25 2014 UTC,"Well, to be honest, when the 3-24-7 DC won the Open Cup last year, it was kind of detrimental to its luster."
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,theshankm,2,Tue Sep 16 02:18:13 2014 UTC,"Eh. Seattle takes the cup seriously, it will bother them enough to satisfy me."
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,jpoRS,1 point,Tue Sep 16 02:35:12 2014 UTC,"Well. They were knocked out of last year's tournament by the Rowdies of the NASL, so they take it seriously? Maybe since they're in the final."
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,theshankm,1 point,Tue Sep 16 13:05:38 2014 UTC,"I don't think too many MLS teams really take it seriously until the semi-finals. For a NASL team, though, a shot at an MLS club is their biggest game all year."
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,JerseysFinest,3,Tue Sep 16 15:30:28 2014 UTC,Plus the seahawks logo looks like a ghetto eagle.
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,Krefted,3,Tue Sep 16 02:22:22 2014 UTC,Is that really where the Starbucks taste comes from? Over-roasting to  reduce transport cost?
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,jpoRS,3,Mon Sep 15 22:43:05 2014 UTC,"I always heard it was so their coffee was homogenized so it tasted the same no matter where you got a cup from, and the only way to do that was to over-roast the beans to burn out the nuanced flavor. But either way, Starbucks coffee is crap because of it."
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,Dean_Moriarty,3,Mon Sep 15 23:29:00 2014 UTC,I have hated Seattle since 2010.   Such a Seattle hipster.
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,dogggis,2,Tue Sep 16 17:55:33 2014 UTC,Ha. Caught me.
PhillyUnion,2ghutj,EdBacon,5,Tue Sep 16 17:57:12 2014 UTC,Fuck Seattle.
