JurassicPark,3e37hy,Suchomimus,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"Unlike the first two movies, it was directed by Joe Johnston of Jumanji fame. Spielberg's involvement with JP and TLW contributed a great amount to the feel of the film, and without Spielberg, Johnston was the best runner-up with his whimsical kid's film work... and he kinda blew it.   The poor script can be attributed to the fact that it was written entirely from scratch, and lacking Michael Crichton, it lost that strong, smart, and realistic backbone the first two films went off of. One writer had little prior experience, and the other two wrote a lot of comedies. Jaffa, Silver and the others did marginially better screenplay-wise in the 4th film, but it still felt lacking and average.  So it isn't terrible, but it is bad, and it's also a very big mess."

Let me spell it out for you. This guy at the Renn Fair? All he's doing is looking at a map someone else has made, and copying- grid by grid likely- something an actual artist has done. He has not done anything creative worth a damn. All those roads and rivers and even the layout of the dinosaurs? It was all made up by the original artist, it's not official and most of it doesn't match up with most official sources. The dinosaur list isn't correct on either and yet they match each other."

JurassicPark,3e14dx,RzK,5,Tue Jul 21 03:46:04 2015 UTC,The fact that the scary part of the t-rex wasn't seeing it. It was hearing/feeling it getting closer. In the dark. In the rain. It's what you didn't see what freaked you out.
JurassicPark,3e14dx,ThePittWolf,9,Tue Jul 21 06:14:59 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. The rex was definitely much scarier in the original, but the Indominus was downright creepy. The Indominus scenes were really well done, suspenseful and eerie. I do think the tone was less subtle than the originals though. That slow, subtlety really helps to build up the suspense and fear. New movies tend to be louder and faster, trying to deliver more thrills per minute."
JurassicPark,3e14dx,sassybluewhale,5,Tue Jul 21 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"The moment they found out the Indominus was in there with them was actually very creepy and i'd feel helpless in that moment aha. Yea I think it's the new style of filming that kinda gets rid of that sense of reality for the film. Spielbergs directing/effects were more natural, he didn't have or use the cool colorful lighting we have (not that it's bad) so it felt like you were looking through a window more than watching a film, which both give you a different fear experience."
JurassicPark,3e14dx,peinoftheworld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:18 2015 UTC,I personally think there is only one shot in Jurassic world that felt 100% like the original. During the irex garage scene. They slowly change focus to reveal the Jurassic park symbol behind the gun on the jeep. That to me felt like the only shot in the movie that gave me JP style chills. Other than that I agree it was missing the creepiness. The irex was great. The raptors almost made it there during the attack scene... Almost
JurassicPark,3e14dx,Cpt_Tripps,3,Tue Jul 21 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"New movies tend to be louder and faster, trying to deliver more thrills per minute.    This was my biggest gripe about JW if they cut 1/3rd of the movie and not tried to make every scene epic/huge/big reveals it would have been a much better experience."
JurassicPark,3e14dx,JuanPedia,3,Tue Jul 21 09:02:49 2015 UTC,"The first film had several drawn-out ""being hunted"" scenes with action scenes sprinkled in.  Jurassic World has more actions scenes with moment of suspense sprinkled in.  In Jurassic Park, the T-Rex attacking the explorer isn't as much of an action scene as it is a suspensful encounter as the animal nudges, flips, and dismembers a vehicle with kids trapped inside.  This goes on for several minutes, and it all goes down while the T-Rex stands in one place most of the time.  In comparison, the Indominus Rex attacking the Gyrosphere is much more of an action scene.  The Gyrosphere is thrown around in a thrilling chase scene, and we get a showdown with an Ankylosaurus, and then we get a brilliant moment of suspense where Zach tries to answer the phone and the Indominus rex slowly shattering the glass.  Once the kids are out, the action kicks up again with another chase.  Jurassic World slides further towards the action side of the spectrum.  As a result, we get more intense action scenes, but fewer eerie and atmospheric scenes.  Trevorrow expressed an interest in having an eerier sequel in the future (wondering about a Spanish horror director's take on JP), so maybe we'll get more suspense next time."
JurassicPark,3e14dx,MotorShoot3r,2,Tue Jul 21 08:40:06 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World is paced a bit faster. No scenes in Jurassic World felt like they were suppose to be suspenseful. Essentially, Jurassic World is to Jurassic Park as Aliens is to Alien."

JurassicPark,3e04r4,DARKDevastat0r,2,Tue Jul 21 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I know. I know. As a kid I LOVED TLW movie, so I still have fondness for it, but I feel objectively that it is pretty bad. None of the characters were really worth caring about, even considering how much I liked Malcolm in JP. And I found Harding to be downright annoying. So I was really surprised by how much I absolutely loved her character in the book. I loved everyone, actually. It was the opposite of the movie. I even loved the stuck-up Levine, haha. He was great and it's a shame they went with such a different plot.   And you're right about the book being more suspenseful! One thing I thought was noteworthy was that herbivores were also seen as dangerous, and needed to be approached with caution, but they never were any kind of threat in the movies.   Anyway, all that complaining aside, I will probably always have fondness for the movie. The one thing I did feel the movie did better was the actual motivations for getting everyone on the island. I thought it was pretty simple and well done, whereas in the book, I couldn't quite figure out why Malcolm would ever go back. I guess he was interested in extinction and so wanted to see the island for himself, but he seemed to do a 180 from the way he acted at the beginning? At least in the movie he was totally reluctant but had to go because his girlfriend went off without telling him. It has been awhile since I read it though so I could be wrong about this point."

However...I had a half-baked idea for JP5 a few weeks back which involved Grant and Owen leading a research team (y'know, because they're both raptor experts) to track a pack of wild raptors migrating across Africa - either that, or to investigate a string of raptor attacks across [fill in the name of a country or region]. Basically, it'd just be an excuse for the movie to show off various parts of the world and all the fascinating ways that dinosaurs are integrating into the world at large."
JurassicPark,3dzj3d,JPexplorer04,8,Mon Jul 20 20:15:57 2015 UTC,"Canonically, Hammond's relevance to the plot had become nonexistent by Jurassic Park 3. Ingen's board had fired Hammond, appointed Ludlow, who then died, thus leaving Ingen bankrupt and without stable corporate structure. Then, sometime after the San Diego Incident, Ingen loses control of both islands.  ""Once the UN and the Costa Rican government decide how to handle that second island...""   Only with Masrani could Ingen be relevant. Hammond was no longer affiliated with Ingen before his death; so Maharani's appeal to Hammond was a professional courtesy more than anything. John Hammond would have had zero input even if Richard Attenborough had survived.   So, no. Masrani still needed to replace Hammond."
JurassicPark,3dzj3d,Suchomimus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:09 2015 UTC,"Something that didn't quite make sense to me was the difference between Masrani (the company) and Ingen. Since Ingen was bought out by Masrani, why did some of the helicopters in JW say ""Ingen"" on the side? I figured that Masrani (the person) wouldn't want people to associate his company with the one that royally fucked up, and try to avoid any affiliation with Ingen to preserve his company's reputation."
JurassicPark,3dzj3d,smegma_toast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"That's true but on the Masrani website it is stated that Hammond was a family friend. He could have easily been appointed some position of power by Simon. I could see him being the jovial head of Public Relations where his task is simple, make sure Jurassic World doesn't have a bad rap due to the failure of Jurassic Park. It wouldn't be too physically demanding for him. Not like we'd see him running from the Indominus with Chris Pratt."
JurassicPark,3dzj3d,brantman19,2,Tue Jul 21 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"Someone would have had to replace Hammond. He was too old and frail to continue trying to be an innovator of any company. InGen was done with on any sort of stage and even if Hammond started some other company then revived InGen (new company would be terrible because no one would invest), he wouldn't have been physically fit to run it. Richard Attenborough was alive during filming of Jurassic World and didn't pass until just over a week after it was done. If his health was there somewhat, he would've been happy to play a part. There just wasn't a part that would've worked well and honored the Hammond from the first 2 films."
JurassicPark,3dzj3d,JuanPedia,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"The most that would have happened would be a cameo.  Hammond knew the animals weren't meant to be attractions and wanted the dinosaurs left alone.  My interpretation is that Masrani misunderstood Hammond's passion for dinosaurs when he built Jurassic World, which I can't see a post-JP Hammond endorsing."
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,sexyloser1128,44,Sun Jul 19 22:48:50 2015 UTC,This is actually one of the main criticisms of the film that I've seen brought up a lot.  Sarah not answering Ian's call to the trailer and wearing the blood-stained jacket are frustratingly irresponsible actions.  The rest I don't have an issue with.  And the InGen crew listening to a random photographer over Ludlow was just to show how little they respected Ludlow.
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,JuanPedia,19,Sun Jul 19 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"Sarah is one of my favorite fictional characters ever, and, like Kelly, I had a huge girl-crush on her as a kid. Seeing what they turned her into in the film was absolutely devastating for 12-year-old me. :( Instead of a badass who kept a pride of lions at bay, physically and emotionally carried Malcolm when he was injured in the attack on the trailers, and chased down a raptor on a motorcycle, we got a dumbass who almost got killed by threatening a stegosaurus' baby, abducting a t-Rex's baby, walking around covered in blood, and sleeping in a tent full of candy bar wrappers beneath the same blood-soaked jacket! I mean JC, she's supposed to be one of the foremost experts on predators and she does everything possible to ensure a bear attack, never mind a goddamn t-Rex."

However, by the middle of the book he's the one that drops the candy bar wrappers from the high-hide (at least I think it was him, and I can't remember if that was before of after he was bitten on the ear by the Compy)."

JurassicPark,3dvqaa,ThandiGhandi,7,Mon Jul 20 04:22:39 2015 UTC,"Just want to jump in here and make an observation that I noticed when I re-watched TLW the other day... Ludlow is in a huge rush throughout the movie and it always leads to disastrous outcomes. First they capture all the dinos and he decides to have a press conference immediately in the middle of the night via satellite. When the dinos get loose and destroy the camp you think they would have sent rescue teams immediately but nope. If I was on the board of InGen and watching that video stream I would have wanted to sent help immediately thinking that they were all in big trouble. The second big thing that Ludlow rushed is that he had all those people waiting on the dock for the T-Rex boat to come in - also in the middle of the night. He honestly can't wait until the next day and get himself situated and make sure that everything is ready to go after the disaster that was his previous conference? I'm not sure that this takes away from the movie, I kind of got a kick out of it once I realized what a frenzied spaz he is at running the company."
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,NightPhoenix,2,Mon Jul 20 05:52:24 2015 UTC,"Just to hit your point about the live broadcast.... Hard to believe that Ludlow, Roland, Dieter, Ajay, Burke or one other InGen team member didn't have a satellite phone to call off the island with for help in an emergency. They had the phones around back then and a big company like that would not have ""spared the expense"" to make sure they had backups for the big satellite trucks. Just saying"
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,brantman19,10,Mon Jul 20 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"The Ludlow thing was just to help portray how unlikable he was, and conversely how much more likable Nick was."

JurassicPark,3dvqaa,sassybluewhale,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:16 2015 UTC,I mean I know that. But they could have written a different scene to show that.
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,jdmgto,2,Mon Jul 20 05:21:31 2015 UTC,"That really fell flat then. Ludlow was just a businessman trying to save his company. Yes, he was clueless on safari but then so would I. The difference is Ludlow was smart enough to hire Roland and then, shock of all shocks, fucking listen to him. In the end the person I liked most in the film was Roland. Nick could have been eaten by raptors, and probably should have been, and I'd have been fine with it."
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,mwerte,3,Mon Jul 20 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he cared about his guys, and actually respected the t-rex's during his hunt."
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,DrSoap,16,Mon Jul 20 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"I really don't like this reasoning, because we never get to what what would happen if the ""bad guys"" succeed. Sure, several people die in the movie due to Nick's actions, but the plan was to bring dinosaurs back to San Diego.   We saw what happened when one dinosaur got loose in the city; imagine what would happen if an entire park of dinosaurs got set loose? It was more of a danger to bring the dinosaurs back, which is why Nick destroyed all of that equipment and freed the dinosaurs.  Sure, they caused a few deaths, but don't act like if the ""bad guys"" got their way everything would have moved smoothly and non-fatally."
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,KeeperofPaddock9,19,Sun Jul 19 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"Nick was a reckless idiot, granted but if you follow the film carefully Roland later calls Nick an ""eco-terrorist"" or something along those lines for his actions. Why would the film even bother with that dialogue if Nick and the Gatherers were meant to be seen as infallible heroes? The film is acknowledging the moral ambiguity in Nick's actions...people really don't give TLW enough credit.  The worst part about topics like these is that they just parrot the same things critics have been saying for 18 years but without bothering to breakout of the ""designated hero"" and ""designated villain"" tropes, which in my opinion do not really apply to this film."

JurassicPark,3dvqaa,leXie_Concussion,7,Mon Jul 20 08:52:10 2015 UTC,"We can infer what the villains' plan was by their actions. They rounded up a collection of herbivores to bring back to the mainland, and were going to head out the next day to kill a t.rex for Roland. Instead, they're forced by circumstance to leave the following day with two tyrannosaurs. While you can infer that the SDPD and animal control weren't prepared to deal with the rampaging rex, if the park in San Diego had opened as planned, they'd likely be prepared for the herbivores to break free, and have a procedure for recapturing them.  Plus, it's unfair to use the San Diego Incident against the film's villains, because of the gaping plot hole of what happened to the ship's crew.  Edit: less sarcasm."

More people would have seen dinosaurs, Ingen would have made a metric shit ton of money, those horrific monsters.

Unlike Jurassic Park (the novel) which was a page turner because of how entertaining it was, I was turning the pages a lot because I wanted it to be over."

JurassicPark,3dvqaa,MotorShoot3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:33:21 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, I don't remember much other than the basic plot details; Dogdson wants dinos that are on a different island, Malcolm goes there too for some reason. The first thing I remember being annoyed by was the title because there is already a novel with a similar plot with the exact same name. At first I thought it may have been a homage but the more I thought about it and the more I read it it just seemed more like a...rip off, for a lack of a better term. The next part was that Malcolm was brought back to life for no reason other then Spielberg wanted Goldblum as the lead for the film. As I said previously it felt like the rough draft of a film script, and felt phoned in and the way it's written feels like a cash grab. Finally I've read five Crichton books, Jurassic Park, Rising Sun, Prey, Micro, and The Lost World. The first four I remember being very suspenseful and during Lost World I was bored."
JurassicPark,3dvqaa,stayshiny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"I reccomend giving it another read. I'm a huge chrichton fan and some of his books (such as prey) I've read over and over, though jurassic Park was always my favourite. The Lost world was almost definitely a homage to the same title by previous authors like sir Arthur conan doyle (whos book I only read a few months ago and it was fantastic). It's also a reference to a theory called ""the lost world"" which is mentioned in the book in a debate between malcolm and levine.   The pace of the book is definitely not the same as some of his other more thriller based books but the plot, I think, is excellent. Aside from the ambiguity of malcolm being alive (although I'm sure he was only referred to as being thought of as dead) it really does carry on well from the first book. It was indeed written at the request of spiels but the movie took a totally different direction, only retaining some of the ecogical morals and the odd plot point.   I think if you can basically separate the book from the movie and read it in an armchair manner, it's a really enjoyable way to spend some time. I love how much science goes into chrichtons work and he really gets into it in TLW.   So that's my two cents, and I know everybody will have their own opinion and that's totally fine, but I think you might get more of a kick from it if you look at it with fresh eyes!"

That had dismemberment, blood etc and the deaths of Genarro and Muldoon show the dinos biting them. Keep it a PG13 rating by cutting away etc in the manner the film did and you could still do the book justice.  The most graphic deaths in the book are probably Nedry's and Wu's, who both have their intestines spilled. Nedry holds his in his hands while Wu gets his eaten whilst he is still alive.

JurassicPark,3dxnfq,Mardak5150,11,Mon Jul 20 13:23:15 2015 UTC,"Tim and Lex were sent to JP around the time their parents were getting divorced, the guy in the Amber mines tells Gennaro, ""Hammond wants to be with his daughter, she's getting a divorce."" Then of course Ariana Richards did a great job showing Lex probably has some abandonment issues with the whole ""he left us!"" scene. That really resonates with me every time, because I can't help but feel like there's way more to it than just the fact that Gennaro ran away.  In The Lost World, a big struggle Kelly Malcolm has to deal with is Malcolm's absence in her life and going back and forth between her parents.  JP3's primary emotional arc stemmed from the Kirbys uniting to find their son, despite their marital separation, and finally coming back together.  Jurassic World has the two boys whose parents sent them away while they are finalizing their divorce."

JurassicPark,3dsaqk,MandoSkirata,40,Sat Jul 18 23:47:54 2015 UTC,I always thought that it was heavily implied that he had Asperger's Syndrome. He exhibited all the traits of it.
JurassicPark,3dsaqk,Attackoftheglobules,13,Sun Jul 19 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"I figured this was the case pretty much right off the bat, although without exposition, some of the way it's implemented is sort of...awkward. For example, when they're watching the mosasaur show, Gray just says, ""It had 88 teeth!"" out of nowhere. From a screenwriting standpoint, that line sticks out like a sore thumb - it just seems like an awkwardly-inserted fact for the sake of throwing a fact into the mix, or (even worse), as cheap buildup for the eventual payoff in the final battle scene.   Also, when they're in the gyrosphere watching the ankylosaurs and Gray corrects Zack to say that there are five dinosaurs - why is he so nonchalant about it when he initially acknowledges the Indominus's presence, but then two seconds later (ie when it's time for the 'reveal'), he suddenly decides to be afraid?"
JurassicPark,3dsaqk,Dynosawrr,11,Sun Jul 19 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that the line felt weirdly forced.  However, with the gyrosphere thing, my assumption was that he couldn't see the Indominus well at first - he probably just saw the skin pattern reflected in the gyrosphere and assumed there was another ankylosaur in front of them. I figured he only got scared as the Indominus loomed in closer and it became clear that 1) it was not an ankylosaur, and 2) it was right behind them."

JurassicPark,3dqg05,SirGroot,3,Sat Jul 18 15:19:50 2015 UTC,"part of me feels that the roar they used in JW was used as part of an ""intonation"" issue with the music. The roar used in the actual film fits well with the score playing as it swells up, but the catch to that is that it sounds underwhelming because it's pitched down (making her sound ""older""). On the other hand, the original roar sounds beast as hell, but it doesn't fit the score as well as the one used in the movie...still prefer the one in this post best though haha"

JurassicPark,3dt0ct,Kraggen,4,Sun Jul 19 04:13:32 2015 UTC,You mean the camera panning from the ground up when the raptors are introduced? Yeah they look a bit cartoony for a second but in the next shot they look fine.
JurassicPark,3dt0ct,KeeperofPaddock9,3,Sun Jul 19 04:27:32 2015 UTC,"They do, it's the only time CGI really stood out to me which is phenomenal in and of itself.  The Indominus looked incredible every single time it showed up.  Honestly I don't think there is a thing wrong with the CG, some of the photos on this sub of the movie done with different color grading improved it in photos and it could be that we saw CG before we saw an animatronic raptor."
JurassicPark,3dt0ct,KeeperofPaddock9,2,Sun Jul 19 04:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly don't know where people are coming from trashing the CG in this movie. Except for that opening raptor shot everything looked solid (okay maybe the Triceratops getting up could have been better).  To be honest I didn't know the raptors in the harnesses were animatronic at first because of all the CG matted over it. I think they should have toned down the CGI in those shots."

My biggest pet peeve of movies that try to portray realistic animal behaviors is when a predator roars right before attacking. This is the stupidest thing a predator can do. Their behavioral motivation is to eat and not get hurt. Watch modern day animals, such as African meat eaters fighting over a carcass, they don't ""fight"" or wrestle with each other, they make empty threats and usually one backs down."

Rather than Dr. Grant leading the group, why doesn't he becomes an activist for an organization, granted with enough power to send squads to patrol the island, in which Owen leads one of them.   Both Grant and Timmy are a bonus, but I would not consider the fact that neither would enter Isla Sorna. Grant already went there and is probably thinking twice about returning and Timmy also would not arrive due to his traumatizing experience from the 93' Isla Nublar incident.   Some of these ideas would either make a rather strong ending in the first act or in the beginning of the second act."

I'm not for bringing characters back without good reason and to think that Grant would give up his passion of paleontology just to go play security for the company that put his life at risk twice, just doesn't add up. Tim's motivations are way flimsy as well.   I'm also not for gratuitous dinosaur violence. Not because I can't handle it or am morally opposed to it, just because it's no better than a Michael Bay movie.

Probably Dr. Wu and Claire as well.  The director also hinted at the possibility of dinosaurs reaching the mainland.  That's pretty much all we know.
JurassicPark,3domid,ThePicardIsAngry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:32:27 2015 UTC,"According to Masrani Global's website, Ingen (more specifically Hoskins) is responsible for security over Los Cinco Muertes. I think you're right, the sequel will be set on Isla Sorna. Hoskins moved Henry Wu and the embryos to a secure location in an Ingen helicopter, and Hoskins was in charge of security for Site B. 14 years have passed since the events of JP3 which gives Ingen plenty of time to build a lab for Wu to create weaponized dinosaurs. Returning to Isla Nublar is improbable at this point in the franchise. Using Isla Sorna as the setting makes more sense than going to the mainland because Site B already has plenty of dinosaurs.   We might also get to see our good buddy Spino!"

JurassicPark,3dm2l2,snufoo,3,Fri Jul 17 14:58:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I find it much worse that they set loose a t-rex in san diego.... The whole second movie is worse than that scene IMO. But to each there own I guess.
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,Delucabazooka,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:55 2015 UTC,Why?
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,Luy22,6,Fri Jul 17 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"Because it felt like the only reason the movie existed is for a Jeff goldblum spinoff.... Don't get me wrong I love me some Dr. malcom, but I Don't think it felt like a Jurassic park movie... Its still a great movie I just feel that it is the weakest in the series.  The charactters were infuriating . And the plot was weird. I mean I get it take the Dino's closer and you make more money. But after the first movie and the government learning what happened there is no way they would have given the OK to bring on to the mainland. It felt rushed and not well planned.  Having said that the third movie was an almost duplicate of the first movie. So I can see how people wouldn't like that either. But just as far as my preferences go the order is  Jpark1, jworld, jpark 3, j park 2."

JurassicPark,3dm2l2,TrexMalcolm,20,Mon Jul 20 06:31:40 2015 UTC,"My only issue with that part is that they used a JP/// raptor. He hadn't seen one like that, so he wouldn't have known what it would look like. However I think it's a brilliant part that demonstrates the inner workings of Grant's mind. For a movie lacking in anything really deep, it's crazy how the one deep part gets so much shit(granted it's not super deep, but still)."
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,undeadmuffin00,16,Fri Jul 17 11:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think they used a JP/// raptor because it was intended as a retcon of their appearance - the common fan theory about the raptors in JP/// is that there were two species on the island, but I don't think the filmmakers thought that way. They said ""Now they look like this""."
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,MrPaleontologist,6,Fri Jul 17 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"I will have to agree with you on that one. They should have used the old raptor for that scene, but that isn't the thing people focus on. They focus on the ""absurdity"" of the scene, when the kind of raptor is the only thing I find wrong with the scene. It is things like this that make me wish Crichton would have done a third book before the movie to explain things like this. Perhaps he learned of these developments in the raptors somehow or research had advanced to give him a better perception of them, but we will never know.  EDIT: I want to state that I know that research IRL wouldn't point to the JP3 animals as velociraptors either, but maybe the JP universe science would have."
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,Luy22,3,Fri Jul 17 11:52:24 2015 UTC,It bugged me too but like dreams pull from memory so he could've just seen a neat artistic rendition of a feathered raptor somewhere in his paleontology travels.
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,Madwolf710,2,Fri Jul 17 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"Well after lost world where the world finds out about site b and it being a nature preserve from then on, of sorts, it's possible that documentary footage (albeit by plane or robotics of some sort) would have almost assuredly been sent out by some group: news agencies, TV networks or shows, etc. I doubt the world would have saw T. rex footage of San Diego on the news, find out Dino's are back, and then have no general thirst to find out other ones are out there and what they are like. So, I'm saying grant very well could have gotten a glimpse of jp3/site b raptors via this footage in whatever format it aired since the list world. Like most things in life, we live moments but those memories fade and get fuzzy. We sort of reconnect the dots then with photos or videos. I'm just saying grants lasting physical impressions of raptors would be this presumed documentary footage, washing over a bit of his actual memories."
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,undeadmuffin00,2,Sat Jul 18 04:17:26 2015 UTC,"That's very possible.   With that in mind, I now want to see a mockumentary about life on site b."

JurassicPark,3dm2l2,KeeperofPaddock9,5,Fri Jul 17 17:59:14 2015 UTC,JP/// is my least favorite of the four but I still like it and I still think it's a worthy JP film. I will try not to parrot myself but I did a thorough defense of the film here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/3b5jzo/maybe_its_time_to_reconcile_with_jp_roman/
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,-WISCONSIN-,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:06 2015 UTC,"That scene isn't really that bad, I agree. It's a dream. I've had dreams featuring stranger things than talking raptors, tbh.  The whole premise of that movie is what makes no sense though. Ok, let's be a 12 year old and let's parasail on some exotic island off Costa Rica with no infrastructure. Well, my parents don't know where I was initially but rather than contact the authorities, they're going to come get me by themselves. Alright so they're going to hire this guy who spent a weekend on an entirely different island but somehow miscommunicate that we're going to that same island. And also, he's going to bring his grad student/post doc with him for some reason and nobody thinks this is a bad idea. Ok now we're on this island which the audience has seen previously but features a gigantic dinosaur we've never seen. Now let's have that dinosaur attack a plane for no reason and then have it kill indiscriminately with no explanation. Among those that it kills is a dinosaur that is objectively stronger than it even given the contemporary interpretation of paleontology. Ok, now there's raptors. We've seen those before. But these raptors are different (tbf, they look cool) with no real explanation for why. Now the giant godzilladon is going to chase these people around the island for no reason until we discover that the 12 year old has somehow survived in spite of this for about 2 months. So now we'll team up with him and run for our lives. Cue a ripoff of a scene featured in the original JP book with Pteradons and the postdoc/graduate student sacrificing himself for some random person he just met. Somehow he ends up living. Ok, now the godzilladon is somehow immune to fire but it distracts him long enough for us to call up a former graduate student for some reason and have her call the authorities... because we couldn't do that ourselves I guess.... and oh yeah, we're going to use an ocarina to confuse the raptors one last time before the entire US military shows up as a taxi service to drive us away...  The dinosaurs are still cool, but that movie essentially has very little else going for it."
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,XeroAnarian,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"Nailed it! The dream sequence was fine, but nearly everything else was just frustrating to me.  One line in particular that they would have just cut was about the Spino not being on the list... Why mention this if you're not going to touch upon it again?  Also, the opening scene... What happened to the boat crew? That boat was going fast, wtf got them?"
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,Chm_Albert_Wesker,3,Mon Jul 20 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"that scene was a bit silly, but was never the reason i disliked the movie. for one, it is like 40 mins shorter than the other 2 and with some movies that's fine and you don't notice but i distinctly remember seeing it the first time and wondering where the rest of the movie was. also, the whole kirby family was irritating in that each character was annoying, had little to no actual usefulness on the island(save maybe the son), and yet everyone got out scottfree. the fact that the only people who died in the movie were a bunch of no name goons made the film seem much less suspenseful, especially when the solution to the whole premise of the movie ended up being ""oh hey let's just send an entire military battalion to secure the island."" if it were that simple, why wasn't this applied to the other 2 movies?"
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,shaned32,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:08 2015 UTC,That scene would have been a lot better if the raptor didn't speak and just hissed instead
JurassicPark,3dm2l2,butt_soup,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"I think the problem I had is it could have actually been a good scary scene. Imagine Grant hears someone saying ""Alan"" and he snaps awake. He looks around, no one's flying the plane, then suddenly someone screams ""ALAN"". He looks over and sees the raptor, it snarls and jumps forward, then someone again screams in panic ""ALAN!"" and he wakes up, everything fine. Instead they went for some weird attempt at humor. That being said, I don't think it's the worst thing ever and I actually enjoy JP///."

JurassicPark,3dm2l2,MotorShoot3r,-2,Mon Jul 20 11:19:31 2015 UTC,"I've never minded that scene as much as raptor gymnastics because it was a dream. The problem I have is how unlikable the characters are even compared to Lost World. I mean come on, the Kirbys kidnapped Billy & Grant the main protagonist of the first film and then he finds out they're not paying him and then they don't even listen to him and then he still continues to help them. Also Grant & Sattler break up. That is one thing you do not have you're main characters do in a sequel. Also it's a terrible SyFy channel B movie. What's with the raptor intelligence they're just animals not humans. What made the raptors scary was because they are the size of humans they're not big like a T Rex so it's not like you can run in a building and hide cause they can follow you. It's the idea of not being able to escape them that makes them scary not the ability to open a door! Also Why do they break Udesky's neck? Is a dinosaur really gonna think to break a humans neck? Oh yeah that brings me  to the Spino this thing sucks it's not scary at all it's a generic movie monster that kills my precious T Rex! Also what's the point of that fight it's like 5 seconds long. Oh my god don't even get me started on how bad and noticeable the effects are, in fact, this movie puts the special in special effects. That opening scene looks great! The animatronics are terrible too. When the Spino attacks the plane it is obviously a robot, the raptors are obviously robots. Also, I know the design of the dinosaurs are updated to fit the new theory of dinos being feathered but it just make sense in the continuity of the series, and the looks themselves are downright hideous! I can't believe I almost forgot about the raptor vocal chamber thing. No! NO! THAT IS NOT HOW THIS WORKS!!! God I hate this movie..."

JurassicPark,3dlw6b,niddhogg666,2,Sun Jul 19 05:36:12 2015 UTC,"It is not that professional programmers couldn't fix the problem , if you notice they did restart the system by turning off the power (hold on to yur butts moment) and on the monitor it read ""system ready"".  After that Arnold went to the generator building where he got mauled by the raptor therefore he could not start up the power for the rest of the park or go back to boot the system again , that's what Lex did.  And i do not know wtf was Tim doing by standing next to her instead of just handing that shotgun to Grant."

JurassicPark,3dhhks,DefenderOfMaine,2,Thu Jul 16 16:43:08 2015 UTC,I bet they would have liked each other.
JurassicPark,3dhhks,Sylar_Lives,12,Thu Jul 16 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like Muldoon would have disagreed with Owen's style, as he viewed the raptors as monsters among animals. In the end, one was eaten by his own raptors and the other wasn't. I feel like that says something about each of their's way of doing things."
JurassicPark,3dhhks,BLACKdrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:49 2015 UTC,But even Owens raptors went nuts and started eating/murdering people.. just because they didn't kill Owen doesn't mean a ton.. Muldoon was still mostly right.
JurassicPark,3dhhks,redhawkinferno,15,Thu Jul 16 22:51:48 2015 UTC,I think Pratts character would have had just a tiny bit more depth if at some point in the movie they mentioned that the reason he wanted to train raptors was because his father (muldoon or whatever) was killed by raptors at the first JP.
JurassicPark,3dhhks,BLACKdrew,25,Thu Jul 16 13:02:36 2015 UTC,I still want him to be the chubby asshole kid from Grant's dig site in the first movie.  Scared into respecting raptors so much he made a life out of it.

It's A Small Jurassic World - plays on main street  Hammond Lab Overture - plays in the creation lab, you'll have to strain your ears at the start of the film.  The Brockway Monorail - This plays when the kids are on the monorail to the gyrosphere ride (after the gallimimus cut scene).

JurassicPark,3dl11j,MotorShoot3r,4,Fri Jul 17 03:14:51 2015 UTC,"Before anything else, Hammond was a business man. He understood that once he was dead, there would be no way to stop the monetization of the animals in some way, especially when Ingen sold (which was inevitable because of the financial pressure).   The best thing he could hope for was someone who cared. He got Masrani. Whether that was for the animal's best is up to personal choice."
JurassicPark,3dl11j,Suchomimus,4,Fri Jul 17 03:25:16 2015 UTC,I guess I always forget Hammond is a business man because he seems so much more like an entertainer to me. While Masrani is no Ludlow he does seem more business oriented than Hammond.
JurassicPark,3dl11j,tommynobel,5,Fri Jul 17 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"Also for what it's worth, he owned a biological preserve in Kenya (I think) before the events of Isla nublar. So he has a history of animal rights to some extent."
JurassicPark,3dl11j,Dynosawrr,5,Fri Jul 17 04:14:02 2015 UTC,Hmm...for some reason that detail slipped my mind. Jurassic Park is also much more of a nature reserve where as JP San Diego was like a circus which could also lead to him wanting to setup on Nublar and abandoning the San Diego sight.
JurassicPark,3dl11j,Dynosawrr,0,Fri Jul 17 04:21:38 2015 UTC,"More specifically, you gotta wonder what the fuck he was smoking when he decided that the best way to get Ingen to not bring dinosaurs to the mainland was to send a team of four relatively-unqualified people with one weapon to the island to research the dinosaurs on the same exact day that Ludlow showed up.   There are a lot of little ins, outs, what-have-yous to this, and maybe I'm missing a few key details because I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I just recall suddenly realizing on my last viewing that the entire plot to get them to the island was flimsy at best."
JurassicPark,3dl11j,oocakesoo,4,Fri Jul 17 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Well, Sarah was an expert in animals or something. Nick was the photographer. Eddie was the field expert. And Malcolm only went because he wanted to save Sarah. Why didn't they take weapons? They were there to document, not hunt. They were also only initially planning to document herbivores not carnivores. Ludlow showing up on the same day was just a coincidence."

This paleontologist with no military training whatsoever is jumping around slaying mercenaries and dinosaurs. I mean I know the 90's was full of crazy over the top radical things like that but yeah.  That said, I love Regina and wish they'd reboot Dino Crisis."
JurassicPark,3dh97t,Luy22,3,Thu Jul 16 13:58:36 2015 UTC,"I agree about Dino Crisis.  Great franchise, sort of overshadowed by other survival horror games of that era, like RE, Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, etc.  I vaguely remember playing that JP game as well, but as a kid I thoroughly enjoyed shooting things as the great paleontologist.  Didn't really examine the realism aspect of it all.  Now that you bring it up, what a stretch that was for a video game sheesh..."

JurassicPark,3dfmdu,MotorShoot3r,8,Wed Jul 15 22:01:21 2015 UTC,"It is explained much better in the novel canon, and this is one case in which there is no reason to assume that it would be any different in film canon, that what is shown in the lab on Isla Nublar skips at least one major step in the cloning process. It makes a lot of sense that there would be a simplified version for guests to see in front of the real process, which would be much more complicated, not to mention dangerous."
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,KommandCBZhi,8,Wed Jul 15 23:21:16 2015 UTC,Ever since TLW I have always assumed that the raptor in the very first scene of Jurassic Park was just being shipped in from Sorna. Where the hell else would she have been on Nublar?
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,LightsStayOnInFrisco,6,Thu Jul 16 01:48:53 2015 UTC,... That's actually a really good point.
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,The_Messiah,2,Thu Jul 16 16:46:49 2015 UTC,The raptors had their own paddock on the Nublar. They were moved to the smaller enclosure per the conversation the group had with Muldoon when they were watching the raptors get fed.  Edit: added video link.
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,MikeGulfSierra,2,Thu Jul 16 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"Hmmmmmm. When Hammond turns to Ellie he says there is a viewing area down below for visitors. As for ""that's why we have to feed them this way"" I always thought he was referring to the opening and closing mechanism so they couldn't get to the fences on the perimeter anymore in order to test them for weaknesses."
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,LightsStayOnInFrisco,3,Fri Jul 17 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"Good points.  Here's my thought process: Muldoon mentioned they had originally bred 8 raptors. The pen where the feeding took place looks too small to hold 8 raptors so they were probably in the paddock area originally. Then they brought in the big raptor. She took over, killed 5 raptors, and had the remaining 2 attack the fences. They decided to move the raptors to this smaller pen. Looking through the script there is a line by Hammond that isn't in the movie but I think backs my point.    HAMMOND  We're - - still perfecting a viewing system. The  raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a  park setting.    That line suggests that they had them in the paddock but it wasn't working out like they hoped. I think the raptor we see in the opening scene of the movie is the big one being moved from the paddock to the pen, hence the over abundance of security.  Edit: The line is on page 38 not 37."
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,MikeGulfSierra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:02:18 2015 UTC,Ah! I see. The script definitely settles it. Thanks!   Btw...guess what I happen to be watching right now? :-)

JurassicPark,3dfmdu,LightsStayOnInFrisco,8,Sat Jul 18 00:19:05 2015 UTC,"This is a good question! On the JP Wiki's Isla Sorna (Movie Canon) page, we are told that the dinosaurs (especially big ones like Tyrannosaurus, I assume) are raised for a while on Sorna before being transported to Nublar. Imagine having to keep a baby Tyrannosaurus protected enough so it doesn't fall ill or get hurt, but also having it get used to a tropical environment. The paddocks and labs on Nublar aren't suitable for this. So until the dinosaurs are old enough to be shown off they are raised on Sorna."
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,EtheyB,5,Wed Jul 15 22:19:52 2015 UTC,"The novels approach Isla Sorna like this. When they were first cloning the dinosaurs, they had no idea whether they would develop properly or even come out of their eggs. So they used assembly line methods of tweeking the DNA in batches, large ones. If the animal didn't live for very long, back to the drawing board, but sometimes they would. Even then, there was no guarantee that they would grow into the animals that the fossils depicted, so they released them out onto the island, in enclosures I would assume, to mature. If it died from some form of defect or just didn't grow into the right shape, back to the drawing board again. And they did this with numerous species, so they needed a lot of space for all of them to grow. In this case, another island, out of the public eye, far away from any tourists camera lens. This way everyone who went to the park would think that the process of actually creating the dinosaurs would be much more simple than it really was. This would give them an even sharper edge against their competitors (Biosyn) who would see this and immediately fall on these stumbling blocks, and possibly give up."
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,MrDNA86,5,Thu Jul 16 04:24:56 2015 UTC,They could have also tested out newly found DNA there to see what the outcome would be
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,shaned32,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"What I wanna know (been awhile since I've read the book) is how long as of TLW it had been since people were working there?  Like there are all these labs, an aviary, bunkers, a second visitor center and a town or two (at least in Trespasser). When did the humans leave and let the dinos roam free? Around the time of JP?"
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,Luy22,3,Thu Jul 16 00:41:45 2015 UTC,In the film canon it would have been when Hurricane Clarissa struck Isla Sorna in 1994.

JurassicPark,3dfmdu,Luy22,2,Thu Jul 16 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"I believe that he thought that the lysine contingency would kick in, but it never did, so, Hammond wanted to keep it as a nature preserve. He only sent the Gatherers after Ludlow took over as CEO of InGen and wanted to capture wild dinosaurs.   So, after the evacuation due to the hurricane, InGen stayed away from Site B under Hammond's ordered until he was removed from his position."
JurassicPark,3dfmdu,KommandCBZhi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:22:15 2015 UTC,"Others covered a decent amount.  In order to get a viable set of animals, you'd need to grow hundreds as bringing an embryo to life is difficult let alone in an extinct animal.  There's processes to control and improve while there is pressure to decrease costs.  It'd require clean room environments and billions of dollars in equipment.  Look at when they first cloned Dolly.  It was exceedingly hard accomplishment and the she didn't survive very long compared to a normal sheep (<10 years.)  They also had the benefit of using existing animals to provide embryos to carry the genetic material and an existing sheep to carry the embryo through development and birth.  With dinosaurs in the JP universe, they're splicing in extra DNA to fill in ""gaps.""  Assuming that's decently possible, you'd have billions of combinations possible and many of them might result in the lack of viability for the animal either in development or shortly after birth/hatching.  For example, a human fetus grows and has all sorts of environmental factors especially hormones bombarding it that help or modify gene expression or development in the womb.  If the timing is off on that in some way, you could end up with non-viable fetus or a miscarriage.  Combine that with the fact they're doing these experiments on a broad range of species and doing so concurrently.  Jurassic Park would have been far less awesome if they just had a T-Rex and by the time they got a triceratops, the t-rex had already died due to age and complications of being a clone.  (The chance that Rexy, ignoring all the other fiction parts, would survive 25+ years is exceedingly low.)  The ideas in Lost World basically walk the line of reality and science fiction in a world where cloning dinosaurs is possible.  Jurassic Park and then further in the Lost World, gave us a world where we could clone dinosaurs but enumerated a number of concerns that would happen even if you take that first leap of faith into science fiction.  The book especially was more detailed on this (and JPIII touched on a bit where the movie Lost World left out) about the massive operation it would take to make a set of viable dinosaurs.  Compounding that (spoilers below) there is the unknown virus that starts destroying their yields that further presents a problem.  This is all before you touch on the zoo logistics of just raising a herd of large animals after successfully making some, containing them, selecting them for the actual park and transporting them.  You'd need to produce a lot of food to support the population.  You'd need towns to support all of the scientists and workers that live on the island and power generation and food for workers."

He is only visiting in person for the weekend to fix bugs- same as all the other guests. He can't reschedule to cause a power outage another night- he's gone back to Cambridge the next day."
JurassicPark,3dfikq,shidarin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, whoa, that's a big difference between the book and movie.  Thanks for bringing it up.    Gotta say I like the movie's tension more, where you know that the others in the control room are already familiar with Nedry, and you know that Nedry is intimately familiar with the control stuff and security.  Even if he's a top expert theoretically on the security, it's harder for me to believe that someone dropping by for the weekend would have the ability to plan a one-man heist like that.  More believable if it's someone who's worked there a long time."
JurassicPark,3dfikq,shidarin,5,Thu Jul 16 10:01:40 2015 UTC,"Well, he has worked there for a long time- remotely! He still programmed EVERYTHING. All the door locks, the building layouts, etc. so he knows how to shut off the door locks, where they keep the embyos, etc- but not how to get to the East Dock.   Movie works with Nedry only being there recently- arrived a few days before Grant."
JurassicPark,3dfikq,King_of_Tacos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"All the door locks, the building layouts, etc. so he knows how to shut off the door locks, where they keep the embyos, etc   This is the part that would be less believable for me.  Even if you've seen and studied the blueprints of door locks and stuff - especially for someone who's work doesn't involve physical stuff - to actually conduct a heist at a location you've actually never been has gotta sound really risky.  I mean, he's not 007 or one of the Ocean's 11 guys, it's Nedry we're talking about.     but not how to get to the East Dock.   Actually, this makes it better.  Lots of people criticize that Nedry in the movie should have done his homework better on how to drive to the East Dock.  But if he's there only for the weekend, it's believable that the actual island terrain confused him (you can't blueprint nature).  Also, if you've lived on Isla Nublar, you probably know how frequent storms are.  Another detail you might miss if you've only worked remotely for InGen.     Movie works with Nedry only being there recently- arrived a few days before Grant.   But I think it's shown that Nedry has worked there for a long time: his dirty desk and the fact that both Samuel L. Jackson and Hammond talk to him as if they have to remind him about stuff constantly."
JurassicPark,3dfikq,CeeCee221b,2,Thu Jul 16 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"Nedry could totally mess up his desk in that time, guy was a pro.   As to the familiarity, I'm pretty familiar with a lot of coworkers who work on a different continent, who I've never met personally. Obviously video meetings are doable now and they weren't then, but back then you could still work closely with someone hundreds of miles away.  As to him knowing the office layouts.. I agree, it's hard to get that from blueprints and plan the heist. Works better if maybe this is his 3rd or 4th trip to the island. In the novels, the East Dock was a small utility dock, not the main dock, so he would never have needed to go before."
JurassicPark,3dfikq,babygodzilla07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"Works better if maybe this is his 3rd or 4th trip to the island.    Yeah, definitely.     In the novels, the East Dock was a small utility dock, not the main dock, so he would never have needed to go before.   Ah, that would make a lot of sense for the movie as well.  Even if he wants to test run it, it's hard for him to do it many times.  Just in case someone sees him doing a test run, it's hard for him to explain, ""Yeah, I'm taking a drive in the Dilo area to the small utility dock for fun.  You know.""  Whereas if it was the main dock, it'd be a lot easier to come up with explanations.  But then, the main dock wouldn't be a good place to do a covert heist.  Definitely the small utility dock (probably with a lot less cameras and staff) would be the place to do it."

JurassicPark,3da2oo,Praise_da_lawd,13,Tue Jul 14 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"I think the estimated lifespan for large theropods like T-rex is something like 30-50 years? If that is the case then Rexy is about right on the fringe of the lower estimate. I think she's 26-27 at this point? But she does look a bit weathered, hard to see her making it to 35."
JurassicPark,3da2oo,KeeperofPaddock9,6,Tue Jul 14 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"So what is the logic behind that estimate? Comparing to birds or other large animals? It just seems a bit low to me, but I am not a scientist so just pulling it out of my ass."
JurassicPark,3da2oo,keepp,10,Tue Jul 14 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"The oldest T-rex specimen discovered is (or was) 28 or so. Apparently paleontologists use examples like modern Eagle lifespans in their estimate.  \http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/07/dinosaur-lifespan  Sauropods are thought to be able to reach over 80 years and even as much as 100 years, theropods living considerably shorter at approx. 30-50 years.  Keep in mind this is just educated guessing since paleontology is effectively biological detective work.  THAT SAID, the animals created by InGen are not 100% genuine dinosaurs and in addition to that their accelerated growth might have limited their total lifespan by 30% or more, explaining Rexy's physical condition at only 27 which should be her prime."
JurassicPark,3da2oo,KeeperofPaddock9,5,Wed Jul 15 00:59:28 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that as an animal in captivity with regular food/water and medical care, she would probably live longer than a wild Tyrannosaurus."

JurassicPark,3dcqhl,MeadyViking,2,Fri Jul 17 06:08:40 2015 UTC,"The key to the details not being covered is to continue to spread the paint even after you've covered the entire part you're painting. It sounds trivial,  but I just kept brushing and brushing the damn thing until the brush was dry and the scales/details were prominent enough.   When I added the brown,  I did the same thing,  but I only painted some stripes first and then spread that paint out over the back,  head etc.   I used cheap paint that I bought at the same place (Meijer).  Each bottle cost around $1.30 or something like that. No fancy stuff here. I didn't seal it and so far it's doing good,  but we'll see how it holds up.  I didn't think of sealing.

JurassicPark,3danso,chiefsfan46,4,Tue Jul 14 20:19:12 2015 UTC,I actually really wish they would make older JP themes LEGO sets. The spinosaurus would make an awesome minifigure
JurassicPark,3danso,NeelZilla,2,Tue Jul 14 21:05:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah the original Spino from the JP/// set was a joke.  The model basically exists for a new Spino thanks to the game...they just need mold it, box it and it will sell.  http://geekologie.com/assets_c/2015/03/jurassic-park-world-video-game-thumb-640x400-30339.jpg"

JurassicPark,3danso,OG_Majisto,2,Wed Jul 15 05:14:00 2015 UTC,I would buy it all! And yeh they released a JPIII set but it looked like this:  http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100924191910/jurassicpark/images/0/01/Lego_spino_jp3_set.jpg
JurassicPark,3danso,NeelZilla,6,Tue Jul 14 21:27:00 2015 UTC,what... What even is that thing
JurassicPark,3danso,Sea-Salt,2,Tue Jul 14 23:28:04 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping they go back through the older stuff eventually. It'd be a real tease if they don't considering all the designs for figures created for the Lego game.
JurassicPark,3d9hip,sage2k,6,Tue Jul 14 15:29:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah the website is pretty inaccurate to what we actually saw on the screen save the T. Rex, and even then they purposefully made her look young and not as old as she actually was."
JurassicPark,3d9hip,JNC96,3,Tue Jul 14 15:39:01 2015 UTC,"You could barely see it in the movie, surely it wouldn't have hurt to have one decent shot of it."
JurassicPark,3d9hip,jwikked,3,Tue Jul 14 16:09:58 2015 UTC,Is it just me or is that Pachy huge compared to the one from TLW?
JurassicPark,3d9hip,musicrages,2,Wed Jul 15 05:13:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's much larger. Looks the size of a real Pachy, so I guess the one in TLW was a juvenile. It does make sense InGen would want to get a supply of young dinos that take less space transporting and would grow later."
JurassicPark,3d9hip,Evanuss,2,Wed Jul 15 08:00:11 2015 UTC,Yup. Awesome.
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,sage2k,7,Tue Jul 14 15:00:08 2015 UTC,Regraded looks way better imo. Wonder why they chose that look for the movie.
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,Heyo_Maggots_,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:01 2015 UTC,Yep! I'd like to regrade the whole movie this way. It'll probably take time though since suspect that most scenes might need to be adjusted for specifically.
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,megustcizer,3,Tue Jul 14 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure which one I like better. The regraded looks more natural, but the original is more vibrant and pops more to the eye in my opinion. Both have their own qualities. Nice job on the regrade!"
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,Antiman1337,3,Wed Jul 15 05:18:53 2015 UTC,The regraded version looks superb!  I'd love to see a regraded version of the whole film.
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,Dilo5,8,Tue Jul 14 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"Do you like the film as it looks currently? Awesome! The movie already looks great for you.  I'm part of the group who don't like the Instagram-ish look of the movie, so please just be patient and tolerant to our tastes, okay?    I made an album of comparison images. Things to compare:    The sky is sky blue in the Regrade Vincent D'Onofrio (orange elbows) and Chris Pratt are less orange in the Regrade The sunlight highlighting the characters is white in the Regrade instead of original yellow/orange-ish The concrete is neutral gray in the Regraded shots :D     Want me to do more clips with this kind of color grading?"
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,tarots,2,Tue Jul 14 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, please! And as soon as the Bluray / 1080p rip is out you know what you're up to do :-)"
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,M0shr0om,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:18:34 2015 UTC,Hehe. I wish there was a way to specify a color grading profile for a movie programmatically and distribute that file you could apply when watching your copy of the movie instead of reencoding the whole movie regraded.  I should look into it.
JurassicPark,3d9dhh,tarots,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:05:31 2015 UTC,"I know some playback codecs (e.g. madVR) allow for color correction, albeit this isn't the same as grading. Perhaps it might allow you to achieve the color grade you want though."

JurassicPark,3d6wmb,gamedemon24,9,Tue Jul 14 01:45:33 2015 UTC,There's already a leaked DVD rip floating around
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,skoomaster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:58:35 2015 UTC,Where can I find it
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,EnterTheWayne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:41:51 2015 UTC,If you have an Android go to Google and search for an app called Showbox. It's on there in HD.

JurassicPark,3d6wmb,MattehPee,10,Tue Jul 14 12:27:46 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know if anyone else thinks world is better than the first three. I personally do.

JurassicPark,3d6wmb,blakeroy,10,Tue Jul 14 03:30:21 2015 UTC,JP3 > anything is an unpopular opinion around here--good on you for saying what you believe in!
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,carrotbasedlunch,2,Tue Jul 14 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"Well, in all honestly, JP3 is certainly more of a fun movie than LW if you're just looking for an action movie. Yeah, LW takes a more character-driven approach with a lot of downtime with the characters bitching at each other, but with JP3, once everyone's on the island, you're pretty much moving from one action piece to another almost non-stop.  Hell, just about as soon as they land, the Spinosaurus is attacking, and not long after we have the infamous T-rex/Spinosaur fight, and a few minutes later the first raptor encounter, and not long after that more run-ins with either the Spinosaurus or raptors, then the birdcage scene, then a quiet family scene before the final showdown with the Spino, and just when you think it's over, the raptors come in at the last second before the cavalry literally comes in and gets our heroes out of there. Yeah, it's a dumb monster flick, but at least it's honest about it."
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,Sea-Salt,4,Tue Jul 14 01:14:12 2015 UTC,I thought it was a masterpiece compared to the second one.
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,gamedemon24,7,Tue Jul 14 17:25:57 2015 UTC,Why?
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,ThreeFistsCompromise,22,Tue Jul 14 01:44:10 2015 UTC,Because I will never forgive the absurd levels of suspended disbelief required for a teenage girl to kill a velociraptor with gymnastics.  NEVER!

How the hell did they not escape a T-Rex by hiding in rooms in the boat it couldn't possibly fit into? The baby was injured and small, so that couldn't have been what killed them. And did we really need Godzilla references?"
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,kenba2099,3,Tue Jul 14 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"The scenes were cut, but there were also supposed to be velociraptors on the boat."
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,shaner23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"That makes a little more sense, but it still leaves a big plot hole that isn't easily solved by any explanation. If the velociraptors were on the boat, wouldn't they be a big issue if not contained and unleashed on the mainland? Simply not showing they were there makes it make no sense, as I mentioned."

JurassicPark,3d6wmb,kenba2099,3,Tue Jul 14 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"For me, it's because the movie feels like it forgot what the actual story even was halfway and then just meandered through several 'finale' scenes and dragged on. I find it the most boring and tedious of the four"
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,ricehard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"It had a thin yet rushed plot, the San Diego scene was massively forced, A GIRL KILLED A VELOCIRAPTOR WITH GYMNASTICS...I was miserable the whole time watching that movie."

JurassicPark,3d6wmb,Splodge_,18,Tue Jul 14 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, there's just no way the original could be topped. There's just that sense of wonder from JP has, with it being the first movie that had dinosaurs you could actually believe were real. I still get misty-eyed from the Brachiosaurus scene, and the T-rex's entrance is still freakin' awesome over 20 years later.  JW owes a lot of its greatness to the original, with loads of callbacks and the respect it has for its predecessor. It's a terrific movie in its own right, that doesn't seem to seek out topping JP, but to create its own spirit."
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,Sea-Salt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:20:22 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of wonder (or the corporate belief in wonder's fading) is what caused the events of JW to unfold as it did, so it was kind of a good fit."
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,kenba2099,39,Tue Jul 14 02:02:34 2015 UTC,For now it's tied in 2nd place for me.  1. Jurassic Park (10/10)  2/3. The Lost World (8.5/10)  2/3. Jurassic World (8.5/10)  4. Tea Leoni Comedy Hour (3/10)
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,09112001,5,Tue Jul 14 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much on the same boat as you. But I'd rank TLW as a solid 3rd, at 7/10."
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,transmogrify,10,Tue Jul 14 01:00:36 2015 UTC,"I liked the action. I just can't see the first movie including lines like ""That thing's part raptor"" or ""Maybe progress should lose for a change"" or ""We need more teeth."" When Ian Malcolm said that life finds a way, Hammond looked at him like he sounded exactly as cheesy as he did."

This is just me personally but I don't believe CGI ever belonged in a Jurassic Park movie, realistic looking dinosaurs is what I loved about the first 3, yes 3 movies.  Why do I get downvoted every time I say something negative about JW."
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,barberboss,27,Tue Jul 14 04:53:58 2015 UTC,You do realize that there was cgi in the first 3 movies right?
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,redfroggy,14,Tue Jul 14 04:06:54 2015 UTC,"Nope, the Gallimimus in JP were totally real, just miniatures. They dressed chickens up as dinosaurs and had the human actors run on a hill in front of the 'stampeding' chickens. It was a forced perspective kind of thing.  That'sallajoke."
JurassicPark,3d6wmb,gordogg24p,12,Tue Jul 14 04:45:22 2015 UTC,"False. Those were all real dinosaurs, and Colin Trevorrow's decision to use CGI instead of real dinosaurs borders on criminal. Those dinosaurs have families to feed, dammit!"
