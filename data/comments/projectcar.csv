It belonged to my wife's grandpa, who bought it new. It's all stock, still has all chrome and accessories attached.  The first time I saw it about 4-5 years ago it was MINT. It was garaged its whole life and was in incredible shape. The first person in the family to inherit it left it outside for 2-3 years in Canadian winters, where it was also banged up in a mechanics yard.  My father in law got it recently, and now it is going to live at my house. We're going to fix it up together, and I think that one day she will be all mine. But not yet.  I'm looking for Buick clubs or other wildcat owners for advice. The plan to start is to put new brake lines in and get the engine unstuck. My father in law want to put a dual tip exhaust on it. I'm not so sure, but our votes aren't equal.  Thanks for looking! EXIF data has been removed from pics."

I would start by looking at what the Ser sentras have as far as mounts, trans, axles, harness, etc since the base models run GAs and the Ser has an Sr20. Also look into the Pulsar GTiR engine which is a Sr20 with itbs and a .60 trim turbo from the factory if you want boost."
projectcar,3dxe0q,UnseenPhoto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:34 2015 UTC,"Mine is the european pulsar. It's actually called sunny here. And there aren't really any sentras around here. I haven't seen a single one. Also, here in portugal, only like 8 GTi-R's were sold. And there certainly isn't one up for sale, for parts. I'm asking cause I saw a 1992 Primera with an SR20 for sale, for parts. No turbo though"
projectcar,3dxe0q,karmavorous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Primeras have a different front suspension that the Sunny/Pulsar.  Sunny/Pulsar have conventional struts in the front, while Primeras have a unique double-wishbone style setup with a strange semi-leading upper arm.  At least here in the US, the Primera (sold as an Infiniti G20) doesn't share any front suspension with any other Nissan product.  If the Sunny/Pulsar is the same as the Sentra here, then you might run into problems with the SR20 axles not fitting the splines on your strut front suspension. And the brakes probably won't swap. And probably the Primera motor mounts won't bolt right up.  But I'm not 100% sure the Pulsar is like the US Sentra in that regard. It might have the same double wishbone as the Primera... but I doubt it...  There probably are the right parts out there to make it work. But those parts will probably be for the Pulsar GTI-R so even finding the missing pieces of the puzzle might be as hard as finding a GTI-R parts car."

projectcar,3dxe0q,kapeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"GA16 is straight swap, cheapest and easiest way. It's literally drop old off, throw new in. SR20 on the other hand isn't that simple but doable with decent amount of time and money. There are several minor things you have to deal with swapping SR20 e.g possible both ends of fuel lines; fuel pump at least, may need to change clutch from cable to hydraulic, some wiring work, powersteering etc etc. And you need an ECU from a donor car.  One interesting engine opinion is CA18DE, never seen one in pulsar though.   My opinion: If you have low to zero skills and experience, do the GA16 swap. It's easy, fun and you learn to deal with things. Also it's super cheap and you gain few hp.   More skilled:  SR20, bit more work to do, bit more money to burn. Nothing dramatic though, gives you solid amount of power.   MAAAAD grease monkey skillz: SR20DETT or CA18DET, the fun is out! this is just brutal, you waste all you money and time for a sake of a '92 Nissan. But hey, it have 300 hp....on front wheels....  Bonus: If you just want to go little faster and louder, sell it and buy 200SX.  Also there is Norwegian viking called EBBdude, he pushed his micra CG13 (1.3 51 hp) to respectful 88hp. There is a project topic on micra.org.uk unfortunately the pics are gone but there's still lot of useful information.  Almost forgot, I have also N14 Sunny GA14DE, what a fun little car!"
projectcar,3dxe0q,kapeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured the engine swaps would work like that. Well, my older brother is like a mad scientist. He quite literally swapped a 70's celica 1600cc engine into his KE30 Corolla, but seeing as that wasn't enough power, he (after using a combination of different carbs, including GSXR ones) converted it into fuel injection, and seeing as that wasn't enough, he turbo'd it.  I actually thought the clutch might be hydraullic on my car. Then again, never had to really fiddle with it. The thing about the SR20 is that, should I do it, it's by getting a complete donor car. And I mean complete. I never did engine swaps myself, but I have a bit of experience. I changed the head gasket when this one blew (right after I bought the car. rotten water hoses).  The thing is that there simply aren't any CA's or any other SR's rolling around. I found this one by accident. The most common ones for sale are the 1.4 like mine, and occasionally you can find a 1600cc one.   And yeah, my car is pretty cool to drive. Agile, and quite quick on its feet. Then again, it doesn't knock my socks off with sheer horsepower. 90hp isn't THAAAAT much"

projectcar,3duove,perfecttttt,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:56 2015 UTC,Is the powdercoat on the brake pistons going to interfere with heat transfer?  From what I learned you want maximal contact between pad and piston to allow the caliper to draw heat away from the pad.
projectcar,3duove,dlok86,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"Dunno. The coating doesn't insulate heat a whole lot.   I thought you wanted to limit heat transfer to the caliper as it will increase the temperature of the brake fluid and cause brake fade.   I plan on making some backing plates that have air ducts coming from the front valance anyway, so the whole thing should be cooler."
projectcar,3duove,phonytough,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"No, you want maximum heat transfer to increase the total heat capacity of the braking system.  There's a few things that cause brake fade:  1) Fluid boiling.  You might be thinking about this.  Won't be as much of a problem if your system is well-bled and you're using racing fluid.  2) Pad / rotor overheat.  You'll get this much more quickly with your current setup.  Brake ducting will help with this but you need all the help you can get in a track car."
projectcar,3duove,Mcflyguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:16 2015 UTC,Would shaving the piston-to-pad contact area resolve this issue?
projectcar,3duove,Mcflyguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"Well according to the Internets, you're right about #1 above.  (Yeah I know I should think before I post, but who does that these days?)  This is one advantage of phenolic pistons over steel: limiting transmission of heat from pad to fluid.  Also why brake shims are used, they're yet another form of insulation.  But then you run into the issue of brake fade due to #2.  Your brake ducts will help a lot here.  As will the fact that you've got much beefier rotors.  I guess things will shake out when you track test.  Let us know how it goes!"

If it were my build, here's what I'd do:  THe engine you picked is a good start and will handle upgrades well, cam, heads, intake, carb etc.  For trans I would go TH400 with a shift kit.  Torque converter would be something with a 2000 rpm stall.  The rear end gears in the V6 Camaro have a 3:43 ratio, good for highway but maybe not the strongest, so that's something to consider.    You can rob most of the conversion parts from a V8 Camaro at a scrap yard, but just be aware, you'll need more than you think.  Good luck!"

I was going to replace all of my suspension in the next few weeks, (struts and springs in the front, shocks and springs in the back) would I be able to just buy v8 springs now to save the money or will it not ride right with the v6 still in the car? I had no idea there were different springs for different engines!   Thank you!"
projectcar,3dvz7h,dont_bro_me_bro,2,Mon Jul 20 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"unless you really want to pay all that extra money for the chrome dress-up kit, skip that crate engine. get a 12499529 crate engine (exact same engine minus the add ons) and add an Edelbrock 2101 intake manifold and the chrome valve covers and air cleaner of your choice and save hundreds.  you could also step up to something much better like a vortec 350 crate. it comes with higher compression and some of the best flowing production GEN1 SBC heads, but a smaller cam. gm part number 12530282. add a carb intake like an edelbrock 2116. best of all, this option will only cost about a $100 more than my previous crate engine suggestion."
projectcar,3dvz7h,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:40 2015 UTC,"To reiterate what /u/reclaimer24 is saying, this isn't a small undertaking, in either work or cost. You have a new (comparatively) car and you are trying to take a step back technology-wise. I'm not saying it is bad, in fact I love these swaps, but it is more complicated because of it.  Your engine choice is great. That Goodwrench engine is a phenomenal smallblock platform, and you can go nearly any direction you want with it. That block has been taken well over 1,000 hp many times and in many different ways. It is also really cheap for the quality you get.   That being said, it is really far away from what you have now, so at a minimum take the price of the longblock and triple it to get near the cost of what the engine will need. Are you planning on going with a carb, or setting up TBI again? If TBI, add another $2k-ish (your 2.8 TBI won't transfer).  As far as transmissions, every automatic one Chevy has ever made has the same bellhousing bolt spacing, so they all bolt up. That's the 2-speed Powerglide all the way up to the 6L80E that comes in the new Camaro/Caddies. For manual transmissions, Chevy was never actually the manufacturer, so you won't find one through them like you will with the engines. I wouldn't discount your T-5 though, people say the same things about the TH350's and they can be built to handle over 1,000hp (the TH400 is better). I would look into getting that beefed up first, and then if it seems cost prohibitive look at the other manual options you have. The transmission rebuild is not something you are going to want to do yourself.  With the new engine, if your driveshaft is too long (presumably this would be the case) then you can get it trimmed and rebalanced for a decent price (do NOT trim it yourself). If it is too short, you will need a new driveshaft, which can be pretty spendy if you have to go new. This all depends on if your motor mounts go exactly into a ""stock V8"" position, and you use a transmission that was offered your car for a given year, giving you a combo that existed in a stock vehicle at some point so you could get shared driveshafts.  Now comes the electrical. If you have TBI now and go with carb later, your gauge cluster and lights will be looking for sensors that don't exist anymore. Even if you go back to TBI, the sensors may not communicate well. This could mean a whole new gauge cluster, or reprogramming it so it either stops looking for certain sensors, or looks in new places.  Rerouting all new hard lines (fuel, transmission, powersteering if need be, etc..) can be time consuming.  There's a good chance you will have to modify the firewall and transmission tunnel.  If the throttle on your engine now is fly-by-wire, that may not carry over to your new engine.  Do you have emissions where you live? If you do, you have to replicate your 1989 emissions system, and be able to pass it's acceptable emissions levels.  There is probably a bunch more that I can think of right now. I will add more as they come back to me.  I don't want to be all doom and gloom though. This will be a very fun car OP, but it's gonna take some work. If you commit to it, you will come out the other side with an understanding of cars that 95% of the world can't rival, and a sense of accomplishment that most people spend their entire lives trying to find and never succeeding."

OP, you got yourself a real project there, but don't take what we're saying as negative, it's just a laundry list of ALL THE THINGS you'll have to take into consideration.  It's a good project and the car itself is a great start, you're not throwing a junkyard 350 into a Berlinetta and half-assing it."

I love the simplicity of it and the fact that it requires none of this computer stuff that is in the car now. (carbs dont require computer stuff right?) Am I wrong to just take out the lights from the gauge cluster/ remove the computer that is in the car now and not worry about it when the carb goes in? Im in BC, emissions were just removed last year so I don't have to worry about that. It was probably worth mentioning that I will be starting my automotive tech apprenticeship in January so over the next 4 years I will be learning more and more skills on the way to becoming a certified mechanic.. which I guess basically means I'll have not only the know-how but the tools, space, equipment etc which will help me keep the cost and time of this project down.

There's a reason it's the most manufactured engine of all time.  So the reading your gauges themselves will have comes from a sensor giving out a digital signal. If your goal is to try to simplify things, which I am all for, get rid of the whole gauge cluster, put a thin painted metal plate in it's place, and then you can put however many and whatever aftermarket gauges you want.   The removal of the computer has to be done right, I'm not sure if that year has a separate chassis harness that handles all the electric windows and locks.... As long as that stuff isn't tied into the computer you will be fine.  Good luck with the project, it is gonna be a ton of fun!"

Of course, for many of us, there are certain jobs that just can't be done ourselves, usually because of a lack of equipment. Not only do you have a sense of pride in your own work, but mechanics are expensive. Especially when you are talking about full restorations and modifications.

projectcar,3dujh0,cyrax6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of your points above, but I would only suggest giving the oil changes part more thought. Oil is the lifeblood of your car. A lot of other things on your car that can fail and not ruin the engine, but oil is one of the only things that can, and quickly.   Oil changes when you have a project car end up becoming a much more personal thing because the piece of mind is worth it's weight in gold. The vast number of oil change places will give you the shittiest oil and filter they can buy so that they get the most profit in return. Some even just clean off your old filter and tell you they put a new one on. So some people bring in their own oil and filter, but unless you watch them do it that doesn't mean they actually used it instead of setting it aside. Many, many places have been caught doing it.  If you have the proper tools (good jack, jack stands, oil drain pan, tire chocks, filter wrench) the job won't take you a long time or be messy.  After that you know how much oil is in there. You know what the old oil looked like when it came out. You know there weren't metal flakes that some ""mechanic"" sprinkled into the drip pan to get you to do more ""repairs"". You know the filter is a good one. You know you got a good oil that works best for your conditions. You get a chance to look under the car for any damage or pending failures. You know, and for the most important thing in your engine it is such a good feeling."
projectcar,3dujh0,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:11 2015 UTC,I hear you and I completely agree with you. I wash and wax my own car because I don't trust the detailing shop around the corner. However I trust the mechanic where I change the oil. Charges me $12 for labour and I get my oil and filter.  Actually I did change the oil in my cars once for each. I do have all the tools and it is not a major job. It is just a messy job. Oil everywhere when not taken care of. Oh I use ramps instead of jacks. More stable that way.

projectcar,3dojcx,cyrax6,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:26:55 2015 UTC,"So I found a 280z where I live and the buyer is asking for $2500. The engine is not in the bay so I can't verify that the engine works. Neither can I verify that the transmission is any good.  Anyway, I noticed that there is rust but I have no sense of what it would cost to fix this car. I am inclined to work on the mechanical parts so rust repair, painting and fittings are not really things I enjoy. Having said that, I took quite a few pictures of the visible rust areas and above is the link.  Areas of rust: * Battery tray * Floor pans * Door jams * Frame?  I did not notice any rust on the fuel tank. There is one more issue with the car - the paint. I am not sure if it is clear in the pics but this car had a hideous paint job done on it. I believe it is Plastidip and without a primer or anything the paint is already peeling off. I am quite certain that I'll need the car repainted.  With these pics I went to a restoration/body shop and I was quoted 8-15K + whatever the paint costs. It also includes a media blast. If it costs that much, I am hesitant to proceed with the project. I am trying to get in touch with other body shops around here but at first blush this seems like a very expensive job.  My plan for any project car is to get it up and running, then worry about the interiors. I don't plan on doing any race track upgrades. My primary goal is to start working and learn about cars (read: mechanic parts)  I'd love to hear what project car thinks about this project and what you think would cost to get it in decent shape."
projectcar,3dojcx,hell_on_wheel,4,Fri Jul 17 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"Walk away from this one.  Keep shopping.  Be patient.  It's always better to start with a car that's already running.

projectcar,3dojcx,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:47:50 2015 UTC,Point noted. Do you think there will be a 280z better than this one? I mean less rust than this? I hope so and I get the sense you know so.

If you can find an example that only has surface rust at the seams (also check around the glass), and the frame's in good shape (and I've seen such examples) go for it.  They're out there.  Can't say they're unmolested... everyone wants to slam these cars, or whatever else.  But as long as the body's in good shape you can undo the other damage."

projectcar,3dk68b,tongboy,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:10 2015 UTC,Please please respond to some of my questions on your previous post
projectcar,3dk68b,tongboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry about missing your questions.  First, I'm pretty sure I've seen your excursion in the blackberries on LocustUSA. White car sliding sideways off the left side of the hill climb course? Glad you got out of that one okay.  As you can see in the recent photos, we have added a full cage to this car. It is 1.5 inch x .095 wall DOM. The Goblin is still available without the cage. It still comes with the main hoop, diagonal and shoulder bars.  The front suspension is SLA with 3 inches of bump and 2.5 of droop. Camber gain is 2.5 degrees over the 3 inches of bump. KPI is 10 degrees and caster is 8 degrees. We arrived at these numbers from what we read online. There is going to be a lot of learning at the track, but we can make any pieces we want and try everything we can think of.  The rear suspension with MacPherson strut is low cost and easy to build but isn't perfect. It doesn't gain as much camber as the front but by changing the height of the tie rod location, we have been able to eliminate bump steer. I've read about Porsche running some bump steer in the rear so we've left the tie rod mount adjustable to try out their idea.  We haven't looked into any major aero components yet. The aluminum floor pan extends from the front bulkhead (just in front of the pedals) to behind the seats. Right now we plan on the hot radiator air going under the car like Ariel Atom, but we could try covering the floor all the way to the nose and allow the radiator exhaust to exit around the front control arms.  We could extend the floor back under the subframe. There is a slight upward angle to the rear of the subframe which could allow a simple diffuser.  The weight of the first car was 1480 pounds. We haven't finished this car enough to weigh it. The seats are Corbeaus that weigh 19 pounds a piece instead of the stock Cobalt 40 pounds each. Not sure how much a racing battery will save. With a little saved on aluminum calipers, wheels and shocks, we hope to be under 1400 even with the full cage. We will eventually look into replacing the subframe with a tube version, probably at the same time that we do a more track oriented rear suspension.  The Cobalt rotors are 10.5 inches so when you add on the caliper, I'm not sure a 13 inch wheel can fit. The stock Cobalt wheels are 15s."
projectcar,3dk68b,tongboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:01:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  That's me :o  Sounds like a good front setup - on the high side for caster on a non-power steering car but a good starting place. Suspension is tough, there is no single right answer and that can be infuriating.  The tiniest bit of bump-in on the rear can help tuck a car but more than a tiny bit and it feels unnerving in a hard corner  Did you eliminate the anti squat/anti-dive from the factory suspension?   1480 is a nice number, especially still running mac struts and cast iron brakes. knocking those down to aluminum units will get you most if not all of the 80lbs you're looking for right there. Kirkey's aren't much lighter than the corbeaus and certainly not as comfy. I'd bet with some good wheels and aluminum brakes and a 5lb battery you'll be south of 1400 by more than 30lbs. AKA just enough to put the super or turbo motor in there and hold it to 1400lbs :D  10.5"" can theoretically fit 13 wheels with the right calipers, it's silly tight but 13"" wheels on a light car at all costs IMO. Nothing like 60/corner qualifying takeoffs for track tires instead of expensive 15"" takeoffs that don't give you the options for the right tire size.  Keep sharing your work - it's awesome to see a nice mid-rear kit coming together in the states!"

projectcar,3dk68b,bigstankfoot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:57:03 2015 UTC,You are correct. Soon after this pic we made the mounts that hold the tie rods to lock the toe angle. The mount is adjustable vertically to enable bump steer adjustments.   We will probably end up running 0 bump steer but we like the idea of making it adjustable in case we want to experiment.

My 280z cost almost twice as much as that 240z and it is in better shape than mine! They are super easy to work on and they are an absolute blast to drive. Parts are cheap and widley available too. With a price like that I would not pass on either of those two!

For your speedos you're in for a lot more work. For a car this age the speedo is probably cable-driven; there's a metal cable connected to your transmission that spins round and round as you move, and this drives gears in the speedo. By the 90s cars were using a pulse generated from somewhere in the drivetrain (usually the differential) which was interpreted by a motor in the gauge to display the speed. So to change your speedo you're going to need some pulse-generation system, a way of interpreting that pulse and some gauges that can make sense of it. Finding a system like that which will bolt straight into your dash will not be easy, so you'd better be good with a soldering iron and other customization skills.

projectcar,3dfemh,a_deadly_fart,4,Wed Jul 15 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"Going from a 4.6 3v to a 5.4 3v is pretty much a plug and play swap. The wiring harness and computer from a 4.6 3v should run a 5.4 but it will need a dyno tune when you're done. Your man hurdles are going to be your intake selection and exhaust headers because 3v 5.4's were only put into trucks and vans.  The long runners on those intakes probably won't clear the hood. And if you want headers they will probably have to be custom. Manifolds will most likely work without any work. In either case the midpipe will have to be custom. You could cut up a set of 4.6 3v headers and make them fit the 5.4  If the donor car is a V6 you're pretty much starting from scratch. So you'll need a 4.6 3v mustang computer, wiring harness, motor mounts, and the correct transmission crossmember at the very least."

You will need one for an 05 to 10 car.  They have a remote mounted shifter. 01 to 04 3650s are out there but won't work because the shifter bolts right to the case making the shifter too far forward for a 05 and up car.   The other options are a mt82 out of a 11-14 v8 car, a TR6060 out of a shelby gt500 or a t56 magnum. The 2011 and up has the same bellhousing bolt pattern. It's a 6 speed but the final gear is about the same as a 3650. The t56 is expensive (like 3k) and you will need to buy a bellhousing.   As far as strength the weakest to the strongest is: 3650 MT82 TR6060 T56 Magnum"

projectcar,3d91vr,Maschinenbau,24,Tue Jul 14 13:24:13 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, cool project. I work as an aerospace structural design/stress engineer, so if I'd like to offer a couple tips if you don't mind.   1) It'd be a good idea to use grade 8 hardware. It looks like you're using 7/16"" UNC fasteners, so a bump to gr 5 will be worth an extra ~3000 lbs of shear strength per fastener. I know it probably sounds like overkill, but there's almost zero downside to using grade 8. I personally like to have the extra strength and not need it, than the other way around.   2) You should address that one misdrilled hole visible in pic 30. Some may tell you it'll be fine if you torque the bolts good and tight but then you're just relying on the weight of your trailer to be passed to your frame through the friction of the angle on your frame at that fastener + the other three fasteners. It's bad practice to rely on friction for load carrying because it's really unpredictable. I know you probably don't want to mess around fabricating a new angle with all that welding, so maybe put a nice thick washer on that hole and weld it on to the angle. Its best to have the holes as snug on the fastener as possible so all the bolts are sharing the load equally. If one hole is oversized or misdrilled, that bolt isn't actually doing anything; for it to experience any load, the other 3 bolts would have to shear off.   Hopefully I don't come off as critical, I don't mean to hack on anyone else's work. Happy wrenching."
projectcar,3d91vr,thisguy60,13,Tue Jul 14 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I too am a structural analyst. Those bolts are all grade 5 and though I didn't calculate anything for this project, I am plenty comfortable with 7,000 lbs of clampload per bolt. I'm also lazy outside of work and those are the bolts that came with the hitch so...  To your 2nd point, I'm sorry but I have to disagree. Shear load in a bolted joint should ONLY be carried through friction between the flanges. Bolts are only there to create a normal force. Yeah the grip area isn't consistent from hole to hole and friction is a cruel unpredictable mistress, but every bolt is definitely carrying load. The holes are shaped funny because I tried to mimic the frame slots for the bumper adjustment.   And no worried, if it weren't for critics in the engineering world, where would we be today?"
projectcar,3d91vr,thisguy60,6,Tue Jul 14 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"Shear load in a bolted joint should ONLY be carried through friction between the flanges. Bolts are only there to create a normal force.   I guess we'll have to agree to disagree with respect to only using bolted joints to create friction load transfer. Bolts work best when loaded in tension, but it's perfectly acceptable to load them in shear. If it weren't, fastener specifications wouldn't provide a shear capability for them. Granted, the joint has to be properly designed. eg only the shank (not the threads) should experience any bearing loads, etc.   That's how things are done in aerospace, if your background is in something else, the rules of thumb there may be different. Load can certainly be carried in friction, but I have always been taught that it is so unpredictable given the prep of the mating surfaces etc, that friction shouldn't be relied upon. Aerospace has much lower margins of safety than most other industries, so if you've designed this joint to a positive margin of safety of 5-10, then you're probably ok.   Either way, I'd recommend you at least ream that hole round or take a die grinder to get rid of those sharp corners. That material isn't helping carry any static load but is creating a stress concentration that may lead to an eventual fatigue failure.   Edit: I thought I'd add to your point regarding shaping the holes to mimic the slots for bumper adjustment. This is is okay for the bumpers, but keep in mind bumpers are designed to only be loaded significantly once (maybe a couple times, depending on how good of a driver is behind the wheel :-) ) in their service life. If holes for bumpers aren't smooth, have burrs, sharp corners, etc,  it's not a big deal. A hitch, on the other hand will experience load cycles every time you touch the brake or gas pedal, so they will be more sensitive to fatigue. It's doubtful anything will fail from there anytime soon, but eliminating stress concentrations is always a good thing."

Such as strut bolts control arm bolts etc."
projectcar,3d91vr,thisguy60,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:59:44 2015 UTC,"Fair point. After thinking about it, there are some other places in the automotive world where slotted/oversized holes exist with no problems. It is possible the designers at the OEM knew they were compromising some strength and/or longevity, but the trade off of ease of assembly on a production line + adjustability to compensate for manufacturing tolerance was worth it to them.  All else equal, a close fitting, perfectly round hole will be best for transferring shear load without fatiguing. At least that's what I was taught in university. However if a slotted joint is torqued properly and a little overbuilt, I could see it being able to last as long as the car. I'll ask OP if he's got some references on how friction load capabilities are calculated, because I'm pretty curious about it now.  For me, when I make thing for my cars, I employ all the best practices in terms of fit & fatigue reduction I use at work. It's probably overkill since they're just cars not airplanes and steel is less susceptible to fatigue than aluminum. But I think it certainly can't hurt and it makes me feel better."
projectcar,3d91vr,MaidenATL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. My post wasn't meant to call you out, I was genuinely curious because there are some serious loads on something like a slotted upper control arm on a heavy car (a full size Chrysler for example) where the bolts need to be very very tight to hold the alignment. It seems to be less of an issue with strut type suspensions."
projectcar,3d91vr,thisguy60,0,Wed Jul 15 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you, exactly what I was going for. Most hitches come with oversized or slotted holes for adjustment/leveling during install. Instead I get a lecture in undergrad engineering from some armchair mechanics :-)"

See my reply to him discussing it.   I apologize, I didn't mean for you to feel I was lecturing you. I had another guy on here say I was being rude about it. My comments were to share best practices and the underlying reasons for them in my experience & education, not to diminish yours. I've been bashing my knuckles on old cars since I was a kid and back then there was no community like this where I could share and get feedback from people with different backgrounds. I certainly could've used it though!   Do you know of a good reference I could look at for calculating shear load transfer via friction? I'm interested to see that because it could probably give me a couple more options on some side projects I'm working on."

projectcar,3d91vr,SecondaryLawnWreckin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"No, OP stated bolts should only be loaded in tension to develop a clamping & friction load. I agreed that they can be used that way (although not the norm for my industry & experience) but they can certainly be used in bearing as well. I got the feeling OP was pretty firm in his position, but I wanted to explain my reasoning and be polite as possible."
projectcar,3d91vr,nofeels_justdebate,0,Wed Jul 15 15:12:13 2015 UTC,Your industry uses different fasteners designed for different applications. You ignore this by diminishing OP's knowledge and experience.  You were not being polite. Intending to be polite is not actually being polite.
projectcar,3d91vr,SecondaryLawnWreckin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yes.   The tension of the bolted connection allows the flanged faces to carry the load. A loose bolt can cause the surfaces to separate, putting the load path into a shear / combo load on the bolt. Not good. The thread roots of a UNC/UNF bolt are like a charpy test setup. Little notch stress intensifies. Those style bolts are designed to be loaded in tension against rigid flanges. The structure will be more resilient than the hardware.   Aero fasteners are designed with a grip length akin to a pin so they can take shear / combo loads as the aluminum parts under them wiggle some. The hardware will be more resilient than the structure. Aero has fun stuff like hi-lock setups that you can reference.  I used to design many motorcycle components, but wheel systems were a good place to learn what happens when a flanged joint has 1 fastener lose preload in a high cycle load situation (rolling and vibration). The first fastener allows the joint to wiggle, causing the area under the next closest bolt head to deformed. After that total rapid disassembly and carnage occurs. Hubs, pulleys, brake discs. It happens. Clean mechanical joint, appropriate anaerobic adhesive for load and materials, and you're good to go.   OP, a washer under the hole will help. At least with peace of mind. Extra peace of mind would be to pick up some loctite 290. You can use it on joints that have already been tightened."

Some more preparation getting to clean metal would help, Using a larger tungsten and larger filler rod would help getting a smoother and flatter weld on this thick of material.(the weld face should be flat to slightly convex)  The weld is probably strong enough for the application.

There are off the shelf kits you can get that will require almost no fabrication. But 4:10 is really tall. Won't be doing much highway driving with that gear.   I'm sure you can get 5 lug axles for your 8.8 and changing to 5 lug in the front will be as simple as getting v8 brakes (I think) you'll probably want discs anyway...  4.9? Sounds great in theory. It is an awesome engine but I'd expect it to be a huge pain to do that swap. It would make sense if it were as simple as just swapping the engine but not so. The small six and big six are quite different. I'd go 302. Cheap to build, basically free cores on Craigslist and the chassis eventually came with one. So more off the shelf parts.   If it were me building a falcon (I'd do a wagon) I'd do a 4 link 8.8"" coilovers and probably stock explorer discs or something. a custom front suspension/ subframe setup with big wildwood discs. A mild 302 build with aluminum heads and a small Holley couple pumper. And a TKO 5 speed.   But I personally think you should start by getting it running and stopping. And go from there."

Anyways, I have a 1993 F-250 7.3 diesel. It's a GREAT truck. The absolute FIRST THING I did after buying the truck was get the coolant professionally flushed, cleaned, and refilled with the proper coolant. I put emphasis on proper because the 7.3 IDIs need SCA (or DCA) charged coolant to prevent the block from rusting in the water jackets. If the coolant isn't cared for properly then the water jackets will rust and eventually cause pinhole leaks in the cylinder wall. THIS IS BAD.    To answer your question, I think these trucks are easy to work on in terms of being a Diesel. The IDIs are some of the simplest diesel engines to work on. They're completely mechanically driven and tend to serve you well if you keep up on oil changes, glow plugs, and maintain the fuel system (check for leaking return lines or worn out Injection Pump). Injectors are cheap too if you consider the fact that they're diesel injectors.    Anything else? Let's see... some people have some serious gripes about the DANA 50 TTB front end. It's a TOUGH axle, especially for being ""independent"" suspension. Keep an eye on balljoints.

LS1 and 2JZ swaps are common in cars for example. You're almost definitely going to need to get new engine mounts, and depending on compatibility a few other parts.  You said you're no expert in these things so I'd assume you're going to have a shop do it...

projectcar,3d1ii4,GTAdriver1988,6,Sun Jul 12 19:25:48 2015 UTC,With a VE of .9 at 6k RPM that engine will flow a maximum of 634 CFM. If you've built it for a higher redline or have the most free-flowing heads on the street you might want to go a little bigger. Assuming a mildly non-stock engine anything over 650 will hurt performance rather than help it. If you haven't done a lot of head work and are shooting for a redline of 5500 you'd be better off with 550-600 CFM.
projectcar,3d1ii4,quarterwitty,2,Sun Jul 12 20:37:01 2015 UTC,Well these are the heads i have http://m.summitracing.com/parts/drt-127422 heres the cam http://www.lunatipower.com/CamSpecCard.aspx?partNumber=60104 and here are the pistons http://m.summitracing.com/parts/stl-h400cp
projectcar,3d1ii4,quarterwitty,7,Sun Jul 12 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"I plugged what data I had (best-guessed the rest) into my modeling software and it showed a difference of only 16HP between a 650 and a 1100 CFM carb. You'd get a few more HP with a 750 as the other guy is suggesting, but only at WOT near redline. I always advocate choosing the smallest carb which you can get away with because a larger-than-necessary  carb, unless you go with a spread-bore vacuum-secondary design, tends to kill throttle response for everyday driving. When I'm building a street engine real-world practicality always wins over absolute max power.   By the way, with fairly conservative headers and 10:1 compression (assumptions on my part due to the other generally appropriate build choices) it also showed a VE of 89%, max-HP of 411 (torque 452lbft and 400+ all the way up to 5000 RPM), and an effective power-limited redline of between 5500 and 5750. It'd be silly to assume the accuracy of those numbers, but if nothing else they're a good ballpark and don't seem to indicate that you're heading in the wrong direction."
projectcar,3d1ii4,quarterwitty,5,Sun Jul 12 22:16:46 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the great response! Do you have any brand preferences? I was thinking of going for an edelbrock carb. My neighbor sold me the engine and everything and suggested getting an edelbrock he said they're easier to tune than a holley and a bit better.
projectcar,3d1ii4,Heiroglyph,3,Sun Jul 12 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"Nah, no preference - they're both pretty good. I've always thought Holleys were easier to mess with, but that's probably because you can't throw a rock without hitting someone who has some spare parts."
projectcar,3d1ii4,lsx2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"I'll give a second vote for an Edelbrock. I've found them to be dead simple personally.  I like to go a little smaller on carbs too. I'd guess 600 cfm.  Being conservative on carb and exhaust tends to bring up the low end torque and throttle response, like /u/quarterwitty  mentioned. If you drive it primarily on the street, that's a great thing. Running at redline is usually rare."
projectcar,3d1ii4,Liquid_Beaver,2,Mon Jul 13 04:33:22 2015 UTC,So if I'd want to drag race go for a smaller carb? What i really want to do with the car when it's all said and done is race it maybe 10 times a year and take it to plenty of shows in the summer then let it sit for the winter.
projectcar,3d1ii4,dratego,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:25:28 2015 UTC,"As was said, the 750 HP will make more power, with most of it being in the upper RPM band...but the 650 will tune easier, and have better throttle response due to the stronger vacuum signal. That being said, I prefer the Edelbrock for long term reliability and ease of novice self tuning...the HP Holley will make more power every single time though. Source: Have dynamometer and have hundreds of dyno charts to back that up."
projectcar,3d1ii4,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:00:53 2015 UTC,"To grossly oversimplify it, a Holley would be a ""racing"" oriented carb, where the Edelbrock would be the more daily driver version. This isn't to say that either one couldn't do the job on the other end of the spectrum, but that is more how they sit out of the box.   The Edelbrock you can change rods in 45 seconds, the airhorn gasket is above the fuel level so bad gaskets won't leak fuel onto your manifold, and everything is kind of designed to be a little more forgiving. They can run off of very low fuel pressure, and are generally easier to get economical tunes out of.  The Holley you can tune the ever living crap out of, and eek out HP like nobodies business, but it can also be more sensitive to temperature and elevation changes.  But to retiterate what Quarter is saying, overcarbing is one of the easiest ways to doom an engine to poor performance with seemingly no reaction to radical changes in tuning.  There's a reason that neighbor's 350 with a 1000 CFM double pumper runs like utter dogshit.  Edit: My vote is the 600-650 CFM range, and Edelbrock over Holley solely because of your relative newness to tuning."

projectcar,3d1ii4,MrBlaaaaah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, but with the only thing I would add being the profound effect that elevation has on carb choice. A car being run predominantly at sea-level, where the air density is very high, a higher CFM carb can sometimes be an option if the VE is high and they are right on the threshold of a larger carb. It may be impossible to undertune that same carb far enough to even run if it was at 6k feet of elevation.  A stock Edelbrock 1406 (600 CFM, electric choke, economy tune) for example, an already lean carb, is still suggested to be an additional 2% leaner for every 1500 feet you go up in elevation."

projectcar,3d1ii4,MaidenATL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:31 2015 UTC,"A 750CFM carb is a decent starting point. 600 and 650cfm carbs are more common and less expensive, usually.

On warm starts it shouldn't be needed.   If you're letting your truck sit long enough, it is quite likely that most of the fuel is evaporating out (the carb is vented so this happens easily) of the carb and it can take some cranking to fill it up.   Do you have a see through fuel filter?  Have you taken a look in the fuel bowl in the carb to see if there's fuel in it after the truck has been sitting? Have you made sure the float is functioning correctly and there's ample fuel in the bowl?  Accelerator pumps can wear out, and ethanol is hard on carb components but if it is a modern carb then it should be fairly tolerant of ethanol.

The 240z is just over 2000 lbs and more than 200-250 is just excessive exept for racing.   Get an L28et. It's a turbo ready motor used in the 280zx and will bolt right in. Then bore it a bit, have the head built and put in some flat top pistons. That is all you need for  a ton of power spend 6k or so on the car so you can get one that is completely rust free, put 2-3k into the motor build. You will also have to upgrade the whole drive train and probably redo the suspension, and might as well throw in a 5 speed. An RB swap for someone who has never worked on a car before is insane.

projectcar,3cz4z2,Nicapizza,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:44:39 2015 UTC,"L28ET and a Borg Warner T5 should be the same overall length as an L24/26/28 with a 4/5 speed. Stock driveshaft should be fine. When you put in a different differential, is when you should start measuring. You can always shorten the original drive shaft, given you take it to a drive shaft specialist and provide him with numbers. He'll shorten and balance the shaft for you, but it shouldn't be a problem."
projectcar,3cz4z2,RaidenediaR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:01:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, just get a donor and pull the engine. Throw on a turbo and triple Weber carbs and you will have super fast response with a strong motor.   If you polish the valve cover it will look great and swap the fuel injection with Webers. You can also steam clean the bay and paint it and powder coat/degrease what you can. Check out /r/Datsun, you can find a lot of help there and there are some great pics of clean engine bays."

If it's a turbo motor, you're also dealing with a lower compression. No point swapping from a Turbo to NA, unless you plan on taking apart the block and building it up for an NA build.

Traditional car batteries are expensive, but available; Tesla-style batteries are even more expensive, but lighter and smaller. However, I don't think Tesla is very friendly towards aftermarket modders, so that is probably an uphill battle.   I think it's an interesting problem to try to solve, but I doubt the technology is where it needs to be right now for you to adapt it to a tiny, sporty car.

Guys have been converting geo metro's and stuff for more than a decade, so there should be a decent amount of info on the topic. I sort of remember most guys would do either a direct drive or attach it to the input shaft on the transmission.  Assuming your car is manual, since it's a transversely mounted mid engine you need to keep the diff, so you'll have to fab a coupler/flange to couple it to the transmission.   Power-wise, I remember lots of stuff using the electric motor and speed controller from an electric forklift, then they'd use however many lead acid batteries (which is where most of the cost comes from) wired in series and parallel as needed. I'm not sure how that would work in your application since space is tight and you need to keep weight down. Also I wouldn't imagine that motor would put out enough power to call it ""sporty"".  Lithium polymer cells are getting really cheap these days so that could be an option. Hell, what might be really awesome is if you could score a used Prius (or any other hybrid probably) battery pack with a few dead cells, then buy some replacement cells on ebay and you've got a $10,000 purpose-built deep cycle pack for a fraction of the cost.

projectcar,3cr0hm,Qexodus,13,Fri Jul 10 16:13:49 2015 UTC,Go to the junkyard and get an Explorer 8.8 with 3.73 or 4.10 gears and stock lsd for about $100-$400 depending on the gears. That and you can upgrade to rear disc brakes with a 1995+ rear end.  If you haven't seen this already  Edit 2: Good job on the progress so far!
projectcar,3cr0hm,WTFducks,4,Fri Jul 10 04:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, was already planning on doing that. I'd prefer to find a low milage wrecked donor so I know it'll be in good shape, but explorers and rangers are hard to find in scrap yards around here. But thanks man!

I believe the engine is a 5.7 350 v8. The car runs but there is a lifter tick as well as the seals are bad causing some oil leakage. Any advice at all would be helpful as to what to check out as well as best places to buy parts.  My friend that is a decent mechanic is going to help me do some of an engine rebuild but I'm not sure what all to check out or if I should take it to a shop to be checked out and have some tests ran.

Most of the time I need an off the shelf/repro part, and since they made a bunch of el caminos the parts are pretty generic. (unless you have a royal knight elky and want some emblems). The commonality is a good and bad thing: smbc parts are cheap, but that also means its not 'rare' if thats your thing..."

But I am super anal about oil changes.  I even change my brake fluid regularly. I didn't over rev it I babied it.  In fact I just finished pressure washing the interior and buffing then waxing and sealing the paint.  It was the cleanest Ford escort I have ever seen.  Sorry for quality I saved them all on photobucket and cannot download on mobile.  But it was beautiful.  Three people made me offers in one month. http://i.imgur.com/ccKTElt.png  The lights on the front were quick disconnects.

projectcar,3cowq7,mynameisalso,2,Fri Jul 10 02:41:52 2015 UTC,"Ah.  I hear about guys running low-viscosity motor oils to eke out tenths of an MPG, which is just silly.  It's pretty much impossible to save enough gas to cover a ring job or valve job -- let alone a new motor -- by changing up oils.  And yeah, even in that picture she looks sweet."
projectcar,3cowq7,professor__doom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:26:25 2015 UTC,Yea I spent days getting it perfect. It was my ex wife's car.  And she messed it up big time.  Total slob.  I had to pressure wash the interior because she smoked like a chimney in the car. The tar literally ran down the street.  But it was sooo nice when I was done.

projectcar,3cowq7,professor__doom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:14:21 2015 UTC,I took the seats out and the carpet out then soaked it with purple power then pressure washed.  Let it sit out on the driveway on a hot day to dry.  Then I reinstalled started the car turned on the heater and put a space heater in the back and let it run over night with a cracked window if the sun doesn't dry it completely.

projectcar,3cmm0w,47REO,16,Thu Jul 9 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"A little background for the curious:  This bus has been in my family more than 20 years now. My parents bought it when I was a kid and my mom did a lot of the woodworking on the interior.  The bus ran when they bought it but unfortunately it was left sitting in a field for ~15 years :(   When I bought it off of them, the biggest trouble was getting it running and rebuilding rusty brakes. Didn't know much about automotive work when I started but I've learned a lot and can now fix this thing on the side of the road, in the dark, with bailing wire and a roll of duct tape ;) A few months ago I drove it 100 miles, the farthest I've gone in one trip. Top speed is 50 mph but it can do hills like a champ, still rocking a 60 year old straight-six!  Still have a lot I'd like to do with it. The new paint job turned out pretty good for just using rollers but it needs a more thorough body work.  I've held off on that so far because my next big project is to completely rebuild the cab-over loft. Haven't decided exactly what I'll put there but I wan't something that fits the original lines better. If you are Leepu from Leepu and Pitbull, please PM me your suggestions :P"

projectcar,3cfm00,ShocK13,4,Tue Jul 7 15:13:43 2015 UTC,"Soda blasting always leaves a residue. You absolutely must wash the surface with soap and water to remove it. I prefer to scrub it down using the soap and water and a coarse green scuff pad to make sure I've gotten everything. Rinse it and then dry it completely, and then clean it with a wax and grease remover. Once you've cleaned it, the surface must be abraded with 180 or rougher paper before body filler. On bare aluminum the 180 should bite into it because it's soft, but on steel I like to use no finer than 80 grit to rough it up.   If you prep it like that you should have no issues as long as you're using a good body filler from a reputable company. That means Evercoat, USC, and very few others. NOT Bondo or 3M filler you find at an auto parts store (that's just Bondo brand with a 3M logo, then own them now)."

There is also a steel structure around the edges where the aluminum is deteriorating.  After I soda blasted I started filling.  And twice it has started bubbling back up. There is literally moisture pouring out of where the body filler is bubbling back up. All the products I'm using are specifically for aluminum."
projectcar,3cfm00,maaseyracer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:06:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, did you wash the soda blasting with soap and water after doing so?

projectcar,3c5kfs,52willys,2,Sun Jul 5 00:38:06 2015 UTC,"I have read of people using K5 Blazers for a similar swap, your best bet is to search 4x4 forums, or just do Google searches.  Either way this will be a lot of cutting and fabrication, but it's been done, and there's nothing stopping you from doing it again.  Good luck and be sure to post project updates if you do get it going!"
projectcar,3c5kfs,Goodgulf,2,Sun Jul 5 01:07:16 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt a Mid 80's frame would be easy to make fit with the 52 body. Those Jeeps are narrow and short where the Square Chevy's are wide and longer wheel base. You would need the welding prowess to narrow and shorten the frame. Then you would need to make new body mounts.   I believe an S10 is a more common frame swap. If you feel you must do the swap then you can check out Pirate 4X4 they would probably have information there.   This video may be a fun watch if you haven't seen it before (even though it is a wagon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK2WTSbmdr4 )  If you are overwhelmed before you start you are likely not to finish the project. Why not look at other smaller projects you can do? If you have the dollars to buy an 80's Chevy truck why not let that just be your work horse. The Willys could just be a fun weekend/show truck.   Or you could do smaller modifications, axles, engine, transmission, transfercase etc."
projectcar,3c5kfs,Gostaverling,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:17:34 2015 UTC,"Howdy! My 1st truck was a 49 willys ok so what you need to do is get a late model s10 frame and some steel plate and 2 s10 2inch body lifts and some 1/4in plate, mount one set of the lift to the frame with the plates bolted to the top then set the cab on top of the plates mark where you need to drill the holes then mount the body to the plates using the other lift and the same for the bed. Now you have a willys mounted to a s10 frame with 4inchs of body lift and more then enough room for a v8, add a RV cam and some 4:10 gears and you will have a super fun truck!"

It came with a hydraulic clutch, and was super simple to install. I still use a factory clutch pedal too. You do have to weld/bolt in some kind of stopper to limit pedal travel, because otherwise it will travel too far and bust the master cylinder. They also sell a hydraulic clutch kit for 2nd gens, if you want a quick and easy way out. It's a little pricey at $650, but I found it was worth every penny, since I'm terrible with transmissions and clutches.

It was running when it went in but is seized now. My partner and I have inherited the car and it would be great to keep the original engine and get it working. I just feel like it would cost a lot less and would end up more reliable with more power if I swap in something newer.   Any thoughts here? I'm also a bit daunted on finding replacement suspension parts here in Australia.

projectcar,3bt8m0,quarterwitty,4,Thu Jul 2 03:19:22 2015 UTC,"Spiffy; makes me regret selling my Mk III all over again :). And that Kaiser is something to behold - I don't think I've ever seen one of those before, and get the feeling that I probably won't. You can see pictures of our '51 in my history.   I don't know if you've noticed this yet, but the reason I extended the offer is because there's just not a whole lot of info about those trucks out there. Consequently, we've spent a lot of time looking at originals in junkyards to figure out original locations for ""R"", ""L"", ""TR"", etc. bolts, factory painting methods (did they paint this assembly together or each piece individually), correct parts finish, and such as that. I also have a trick for dealing with the lousy reproduction air cleaner decal, and can tell you which reproduction parts are passable and which are completely unacceptable (haven't found any at all which were ""good""). The repro hood hinges are a good example of this - they sent us a set with two distinctly different designs. One would probably have been passable if you aren't an absolute perfectionist, but they didn't match and were both painted black - original finish was silver cad. So I made some new shoulder rivets on my lathe and we disassembled and refinished the originals. Doing one of these trucks right is a bit of a minefield.   But because they've been relatively unpopular for so long there aren't too awful many left, and most of the completed ones you see have been customized or restored incorrectly. The prices for mediocre ones have been going up noticeably so I'd expect really nice ones to be worth a surprising amount in the near future."

Loads of interesting engineering on it, but the go fast parts are all sound.  The plan is to pull out the worst of the funky stuff (roll bar made of muffler pipe barely welded to the floor, stereo amp, and foam letters ""Pinto V8 Ford 5.0"" glued where the back seat was), fix the speedometer, and tranny leak, then run it the rest of this season.

(1987 Celica st) I bought a decent all-in-one portable type tool set from sears, some jack stacks, wheel blocks, and a haynes manual. Air tools would have been great to have, and it took me too long to realize I need a torque wrench. I signed up for as many forums as I could and read everything. It was a good place to start, and I've had several cars since. I'm not a mechanic by trade, but I have little hesitation towards almost any job. If cars are a bit overwhelming or take up too much space, look into motorcycles. Anything you can put your hands on will help you out. I once bought a blown engine just so I could take it apart to see how it all worked. $50 well spent in my mind."

I would recommend picking a specific car, or cars, you would like to have and/or work on. Then look around for enthusiast forums for that specific car. For example, I've got a Lexus SC400 and clublexus.com is one of the most popular forums for this car. They have a subforum for that specific vehicle, and they even have a regional section on the site.   You'll find some cars or manufacturers don't really have an active userbase online, so you might be slow to get responses or you might not find a site at all to talk to others about the vehicle which can suck. If it's a car that isn't popular enough, look for something similar (often cars will share chassis, engine, or other main components) and see if others are working on those.   But once you find a good forum for the car you like look into the member base. You'll often find the handful of members that post often. Clublexus.com that I mentioned, for example, has a specific section for the SC300/SC400 for current builds (projects). If I were nearby any of those guys and they made a post like ""installing this new brake kit"" or something similar, a bunch would jump on an offer for a set of hands to come by and help.   Hell, I would have killed for someone to help me replace the front struts when I did them (first time I did something like that). The more skilled people are, the more comfortable they'll be will letting you come by, and you could even say you'd like to be there just to hand over a wrench and learn how things are done (if you aren't willing to do that, you may not like what this is all about).   tl;dr: try finding people through car forums to work with."

projectcar,3bgrfr,schzap,4,Mon Jun 29 15:52:24 2015 UTC,It's full of holes so it dries out underneath pretty quick. Main reason for having it is to keep the amount of water down that leaks in through the windshield seal. Once it's on the road I'm taking it to a glass place to get that fixed

I've found the best solution is using a dessicant (I just grab the DampRid hangers that are easily available at the supermarket but there are other options) since even if I cover it up it still gathers moisture and condenses it everywhere.

The guy we talked to at the paint shop has been painting for over 40 years, and I trusted his opinion on the matter. I've also seen a bunch of similar testimony on a bunch of other forums saying the same thing.  It seems that the older paints (lacquer and so on) are definitely dependent on humidity. But the new urethane paints aren't really dependent on it.  I mean if you're a professional painter, which you haven't really mentioned, I'd be more inclined to accept your advice in telling me I fucked up.

projectcar,3bd5zk,toxicfreeLoL,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:55:44 2015 UTC,Heh I have a cb 450 too and a 500. I actually think I have an extra tank hanging on the wall. It has rust inside but mine was just as bad and cleaned up with vinegar. Maybe ill try cleaning it up and see if it comes out good enough to use.
projectcar,3bd5zk,data_double,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:47:56 2015 UTC,Let me know how it turns out if you do decide to.

I've moved to a new place and we are building a workshop next week, this bike will be the first project completed in the new shop. Gonna go for a retro cafe style build."
projectcar,3bd5zk,Gatecrasher3,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:22:43 2015 UTC,That would be cool. I'm probably going to restore thus one to stock or almost stock. I may upgrade the brakes.
projectcar,3bd5zk,TheArgentine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:40:13 2015 UTC,Looks like a great project to have! Any estimate how long it'll take?
projectcar,3beevs,TheRealFilthyRich,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:25:49 2015 UTC,"Most people wouldn't touch that car.  Well, they'd probably touch it, then have to bail out like the first guy did.  This should be interesting."
projectcar,3beevs,Heiroglyph,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:02 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have touched here either except that its numbers matching 400 high output.  We got receipts with more invested then what we paid for it.  I know there are lots of pieces missing but I am looking forward to the project.  I get motivated to do something by other people telling me I can't so keep it coming!

I'm currently searching for a new pair of rear quarter panels, and a different hood.  The plan is to put in a seat so we can move it, then back to the bodywork."
projectcar,3bczgi,flyingfalcon12,3,Sun Jun 28 01:27:16 2015 UTC,Are the quarters basically bondo? Looks almost as if the body work was started and never sanded
projectcar,3bczgi,swingandaMs,3,Sun Jun 28 03:06:08 2015 UTC,"They're pretty well covered in it.  We haven't gotten around to sanding the panels yet.  I've mostly been trying to clean up the front so far.    I plan on gutting the interior in the next couple of days, and I'll take some more pictures of the interior and front exterior."
projectcar,3bczgi,swingandaMs,2,Sun Jun 28 03:11:42 2015 UTC,It would go to rock auto for the patch panels. It doesn't look like you can get a full quarter from them though.
projectcar,3bczgi,blandusernameftw,4,Sun Jun 28 02:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't been able to find anything except for patches for new parts.  Though I'm looking around for lots that are parting out.    There's a fair bit of other work to spend my time on, so hopefully I'll find some used panels by the time I catch up on the rest of the body."

He calls me up and says that he may have a couple that I might be interested in.   I have the choice between the Trans-Am and the Challenger. I'm leaning toward both and starting on the Challenger. The girlfriend wants the Trans-Am.  That Charger with be there until he dies I regret. He's not letting that go for anything.   Along with these he has a, 1965 Barracuda 273 Commando (Original Paint), Dodge Dart Swinger, Cornette, and a Valiant. Of course none of them are running and he's taking his time on them.   I'm thinking of putting on a shaker hood and putting in a 512 on the Challenger. It'll be a long costly project, but I can't wait to start."

projectcar,3bcn7u,KrispyWoT,3,Sat Jun 27 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"it's a perfect patina car, leave it as is IMO. it already looks to be in great shape for it's age, most of that age are either rusty or restored and not many originals in between. there are some coatings you can use as well to help preserve the current paint patina so it doesn't rust through in areas as you drive it around. eastwood is a good company to use. have fun with it as is"
projectcar,3bcn7u,EC_CO,2,Sun Jun 28 00:19:47 2015 UTC,Hell YES! Cool little driver. Cheap to fix and drive.
projectcar,3bcn7u,rodneyachance,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:42:54 2015 UTC,How cheap do you think? I think it needs a new paint job and some upholstery work
projectcar,3bcn7u,rodneyachance,2,Sun Jun 28 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with other commenters; leave the paint alone. Scrub the daylights out of it inside and out, double-check dull stuff like tires and hoses and belts for cracking (assuming) it has been sitting a while. You'll find that there is plenty that cars need after they have sat up a long time. Front-end bushings, brake lines, rubber fuel lines....that junk needs to be inspected and replaced as necessary with the money you'd thought of spending on the paint. Once you get a clean bill of health on the boring and nearly-invisible odds and ends, go ahead and throw a few pennies at the upholstery. Maybe re-chrome the bumpers. Cannot tell from the pics but could a very good detail guy clay-block and buff the paint so it'd shine for a year more? Neat car. I bet it gets more attention than you expect."

projectcar,3b9mmi,Ecgxsmilly,6,Sat Jun 27 05:08:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, you just need some basic skill and a digital manometer. It's nothing to be afraid of, if you're willing to put in the time to get it right, or pay a local bike mechanic to tune it."
projectcar,3b9mmi,Ecgxsmilly,2,Sat Jun 27 13:28:14 2015 UTC,That's also true. My experience was with a dodge six pack. Was not fun

Honestly I'd say $3-4k tops should you do decide to go for it. Probably closer $3k.. I've never heard of anyone welding an engine block before and thatd make me nervous.

If it were me, and the floors were in decent shape, I'd offer the guy somewhere around $5-6k."

projectcar,3b9mmi,NervenkitzelHaus,2,Sat Jun 27 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"It looks cool and all, but this is NOT the car for a first time project. Between the waiting for hard to find parts, the cost of said parts, the research needed to come up with a solution when parts aren't available, the bodywork needed (the time needed to learn how to do the bodywork, or the cost to have someone else do it), all of the rusty bolts that are going to snap and need drilling out and retapping, and learning how to do all of these things for the first time, will have you pulling your hair out while broke and with no more free time left.  Don't do it. Buy the car if you can get a crazy deal on it. Maybe hold on to it if you have the space, get another project car thats in better shape to learn on first. Or buy it, flip it on the honda forums, and then you'll have more money to buy a project car that's in better shape. I wish I could tell you to go for it, it's a cool looking rare honda (had a 92 gsr, i like rare hondas) but it honestly will nickel and dime you to death and just leave you frustrated. I really mean no offense, but this is a project for someone that really knows how to do bodywork, like someone that has their own bodyshop, and has taken out hundreds of snapped rusty bolts. Cool find, anyways. I hope you buy it and flip it, make money on it and give it a good home."
projectcar,3b9mmi,KSKaleido,2,Sat Jun 27 19:15:42 2015 UTC,"This is not a great first project. If you buy this car, resist the compulsion to tear it into bits and do a frame off resto. Leave it alone, get a $100 Camaro to learn bodywork and rust repair on, and don't wade in on this yourself til you know what you're doing.   This car deserves experienced hands to bring it back."

projectcar,3b7o6v,GetHighr,19,Fri Jun 26 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"Alright.   Started with a mostly stock car. Stock wheels were in decent shape. Paint was badly swirled, brakes needed to be replaced. Exhaust needed to be replaced along with many shotty repairs the previous owner had done.   Upgraded the brakes because the fronts were shot. Bought these wilwood brakes for a good price, couldn't pass them up. Figured I should put some better wheels on the while I was at it. The wheels didn't sit very well for my taste, so I bought the proper spacers to fit my taste  Couldn't avoid a huge chunk of concrete in the middle of the road. Damaged a wheel, dented my drive shaft and bent the lip of my diff cover. Was able to limp the car home. Decided to put 4.10 gears and Pro 5.0 shifter in it while I was at it.  Went in on the group buy for some unique frosted tail lights, looked alright but decided they weren't for me  Bought everything needed to do a paint correction, which the car badly needed.  Before, nice and swirly  After. Better, but it was my first attempt  Next step for the car is to do a mild build. Purchased a pair of 799 heads, Fast 90/90 intake combo, long tube headers. Still deciding on what cam I want. Will have move in the future.   I'm missing quite a bit, but those are the bigger things I've done with the car."

If you want to do a custom chassis in the mold of a race car and all the subsystems to match (brakes, suspension and components, electronics, driver interface, bodywork, etc) I would budget probably $30k. Not to mention tools. You'd need a TIG welder, mill, lathe, and all the accoutrements. If you want to design all of that then you're going to need to read a degree worth of textbooks and utilize some CAD and analysis programs.  That's why starting with a kit car would be such a steal. He'll just taking ground up suspension design out of the mix will save you dozens or hundreds of hours of time."

One thing to figure out is what other years and models of Honda bikes used the same tank.  Figure out what bikes had tanks which were close enough to fit.  Understand that with a bike that old, new tanks (and many other new in box parts) probably don't exist.  Sometimes new parts pop up when an old dealership cleans out the stock room, but those parts demand huge premiums.  Tanks in good condition will only pop up now and then when the bikes they belong to are parted out.  Tanks can also be fabricated if that is the only option at the end of the search.  I have a 72 cb450 that will be sitting until I gather the will to rebuild the motor.  The 4 rocker arms are shot and I can either buy new ones for about 125 dollars each or have them built up and hardened for 75 dollars each.

When towing you don't want a lot of tongue weight so really there wont be much more weight on the cars tires. I think most hitches say 500 pounds max tongue weight. so Id say pretty much just get tires weighted for your vehicle. also these cars can fit some tall and wide tires.

projectcar,3b4dpu,donkey90745,2,Fri Jun 26 01:34:46 2015 UTC,"I've been working on a similar problem with an RV I just came into possession of.  I've been talking about this with my gearhead friends, trucker friends, a state trooper, techs and engineers and have not got a single consistent response.  The best discussion I've had on the subject was with engineer who works for Ford's custom chassis department and if I were to take any one person's word as gospel on the subject, it would be his.  What he gave me was a complicated formula involving moments, center of gravity, axle/wheel load distribution, hitch rating, GVW, GVWR and a half dozen other factors.  He was kind enough to give me an hour of his time breaking it all down for me and I'll share with you my takeaway from the conversation:  GVWR should be considered the ""never exceed"" weight of your vehicle and load.  That means passengers, fuel, fluids, cargo and towed load, when added up, should not be over GVWR.  We can argue about the safety of exceeding that figure all day and night and not even the engineer had a clear answer to that (well, besides the elaborate formula he uses to determine true GVWR).  By exceeding GVWR you are giving license for insurance and warranty claims to be denied and, in states where it's illegal to exceed GVWR, inviting a really, really nasty citation.  He explained that the most limiting factors in GVWR and tow capacity are braking performance and transmission wear, emphasis on the brakes.  I second el_muerte17's advice.  The tires you have should be fine (assuming they are in good shape), but if you want to be thorough, we can employ some basic algebra to know for sure.  Just ask and I'll be happy to break it down.  To condense the entire conversation down to a tl;dr: The simplest way to determine your vehicle's towing capacity is to take your vehicle's GVWR and subtract the actual vehicle weight with fluids and fuel topped off.  That figure will be limited most by hitch rating and brake performance.  Transmission capabilities should be considered too.  Installing a transmission temperature sensor will help out a lot.  I am the sort who takes safety very seriously and refuse to leave anything to chance when I can.  I'd recommend keeping an infrared thermometer with you and periodically check your tire temps en route and at your destination, especially if you're going up and down hills.  Seeing that temperatures don't get too high is important, but be sure you note differences in temperature between tires as that is an indication something is seriously wrong.  I hope all this info is more helpful than confusing."

projectcar,3azy7b,el_refrigerator,3,Wed Jun 24 21:48:47 2015 UTC,The gas tank will probably have crud in it that will flow down the line if you let it gumming up the carb etc.  So best to do it all at once.
projectcar,3azy7b,NordicNightmare,3,Thu Jun 25 01:18:07 2015 UTC,"The gas in the tank - if there is any at this point - would be VERY bad to try to run the car on. You'll screw the carbs up for sure if you try that.  So to try to get it running - just to hear it run and see how the engine is doing - disconnect the fuel line from the fuel pump on the inlet side - the hose that goes from the tank to the fuel pump.  Disconnect that line, get another piece of fuel line the same size and a few feet long and connect it to the inlet port on the fuel pump and drop the other end into a gas can with fresh gas in it.  This way you'll be sucking clean fuel.  You will probably need to clean the carbs - if they had fuel in the float bowls that evaporated while the car sat, then the float bowls are probably full of gunk.  The carbs that came on the car are probably SU (Skinner Union) carbs. There aren't a lot of people around any more that know how to probably rebuild and tune those carbs.  The throttle shafts wear out, they leak air past the throttle shafts, and this makes it nearly impossible to get a good idle. I think that's probably the major thing that happens these cars that make people stop driving them (barring any other catastrophic failure of the engine).  In order to fix the leaky throttle shafts, you have to take the carbs off, send them to a machine shop that will machine out the carb bodies and install bushings and new throttle shafts... and there's not a lot of places that will take on such a task.  When we looked into having that done on my Girlfriend's '67 MGB it was going to be like $600 to have both carbs done. And after that you still have to reinstall them, sync them, and tune them.  Or if you aren't a purist, you can replace the carbs with a more conventional downdraft carb such as this.  That is an almost complete kit to do the conversion, but you'll need a longer choke cable. You can pick up universal choke cables for $20 or so. You could also look for maybe a Weber DGAV which is just the same thing with an automatic choke.  We put a Weber DGV on my girlfriend's '67 and it starts instantly and idles smoothly rather than cranking and cranking and finally starting up and then barely idling - as the SUs did.  You also want to take the wheels off and look at the wheel splines.  When you take those wire wheels off, there's a splined peg that sticks out from the hubs. The wheels have an internal spline that matches up to the pegs.  Those splines, the internal ones in the wheels and the corresponding splined peg on the hubs tend to wear out over time. That can be a major expense to repair. Personally, I'd rather deal with a little rust than to have to replace the splined pegs and wheels. The wheels will cost you $1500 and the splined pegs could cost you another $500 for the parts and several hours of labor at a shop to replace. To replace the rear splines, I believe the rear axles must be removed from the housing in order to replace the pegs.  This won't keep the car from running, but when you do get it running it might be the next thing you want to start dealing with.  Also, you have to call around and find a tire shop that can deal with wire wheels. Don't take it to any old tire shop - they could fuck up your wheels if they don't know what they're doing. That's assuming your wheels aren't already fucked up from worn splines.  Once you get past those things - the exotic carbs and the weird wheels and splines - working on an old MGB is pretty much like working on any old car. Check compression. Check spark. If those are both good, then you got a problem with the carbs.  You can shoot some starter fluid into the carbs (you'll have to take off the factory air filter to do it) and if it's getting spark it should fire up for a second. Probably will smoke like all hell since it has been sitting for a long time.  Good luck with it!  If you have any specific questions feel free to ask.   FWIW, my girlfriend got her '67 MGB from her mom. It had also been sitting for 20 years when we took possession of it. And we bought a parts car for it that we ended up just reselling because it was too nice to part out. That one had also been sitting for more than 10 years and we got it running quite easily - although the brake were shot so we couldn't really drive it.  So I have a little experience with such things.   But the guys at /r/littlebritishcars would probably know a lot more than I do."

projectcar,3b0wox,augustuen,2,Thu Jun 25 04:58:32 2015 UTC,"If it is 3500lbs, then he's already pretty much dead in the water. The evo weighs at least 2800lbs, plus the trailer, tyres, petrol, etc."
projectcar,3b0wox,augustuen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:52:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I'm quite aware, and if he insists on overloading the hitch on top of it all, I'm going to sink my time and money in an airplane instead.  That being said, though, I do want to try and get the best towing performance I can out of it.  If this RV can carry 2,000 lbs in tow and a couple passengers over the Rockies at 40 or 50 mph without engine and transmission temps climbing too much, I'll be quite satisfied.  If putting a bigger/better radiator and transmission cooler will be a big help in this as well as mitigating some of my brother's recklessness, I'll buy the parts and put them in next weekend."
projectcar,3b0wox,1989toy4wd,2,Thu Jun 25 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"Well, if he insists, bigger radiator, different coolant, oil and trans cooler, electric fans if it doesn't have it already, not sure how much it'll help though. If he really wants to sink money into it, he could gear it lower, making it easier on the engine."
projectcar,3b0wox,1989toy4wd,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"That's the plan, but I'm having trouble finding any good information how much help it would be.  I was hoping the good folks on Reddit might have some experience to share or point me to a good resource, as my google-fu has failed me.  Hell, maybe I'll suck up the cost of the transmission fluid, put a temperature sensor in before installing additional cooling and do some before/after comparisons ... for science."
projectcar,3b0wox,1989toy4wd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"The hitch isn't even rated for enough weight. So no, he can't tow a car on a trailer. He might be able to flat tow a vehicle, but not an Evo."
projectcar,3b0wox,AustinMiniMan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"He is threatening to upgrade the hitch, though.  That's the only reason I haven't walked away from this project and why I feel the need to do what I can to make sure I will still have an RV for Burning Man next year."

Of all the project cars i have checked out and would want to own ('72 Chevelle, '74 Stingray, '67 Camaro, etc) this '67 Mustang (my favorite year) is super cheap in general and in comparison to those others.   So what do you think?"
projectcar,3ax8if,NordicNightmare,2,Wed Jun 24 06:02:55 2015 UTC,If you are really looking for something to do a proper restoration starting with the cheapest car you can find will end up costing far more in the long run.  Fixing rust or replacing missing parts adds up extremely quickly.
projectcar,3ax8if,FesteringNeonDistrac,4,Wed Jun 24 14:17:20 2015 UTC,"I'm beginning to think that on craigslist the words 'project car' means 'we worked on it a bit, and decided this is fucking hopeless'   Missing parts can be a nightmare. There are often no aftermarket repops, so you are stuck scouring ebay and swap meets."
projectcar,3ax8if,SnapMokies,3,Wed Jun 24 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"That's a common problem no question, but at least on a Mustang like this I'd expect someone makes just about everything for them aftermarket.  I remember reading a few years ago it was actually possible, if pricy, to build a '67 Mustang from all brand new reproduction parts."
projectcar,3ax8if,FesteringNeonDistrac,3,Wed Jun 24 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only part of a Mustang you absolutely HAVE to have is the VIN. Same with Jeeps and Beetles and I'm sure there are some others. I'm just saying that as a general comment, not really specific to this project."
projectcar,3ax8if,Triangullum,0,Wed Jun 24 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"There are often no aftermarket repops   But luckily you can essentially buy an entire mustang from scott drake, cjponyparts, NPD etc."
projectcar,3ax8if,kowalski71,2,Thu Jun 25 06:57:06 2015 UTC,"The fact that there's zero mention of the condition of the body means that you can assume rust in the floors and rockers, maybe more. That being said, there are a lot of repair body panels available for these and it could be a pretty easy/cheap repair. I would go check it out and really poke around the body (focus on the suspension points) to see how bad it is."
projectcar,3ax8if,BrentRS1985,2,Wed Jun 24 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"Replacing body panels is never cheap or easy unless you yourself are a skilled body man, or you have access to original sheet metal in great condition. Re-popped sheet metal never fits right and often requires extensive work to make it right."
projectcar,3ax8if,kowalski71,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"I agree that it can be but especially with the Mustang being such a common car he could probably get quotes for the bodywork with some really detailed pictures. As for body panels, that would be a question for a dedicated forum or someone who knows old Mustangs. There's a huge range of quality and some of the cars I've owned have true pop in high quality panels available."

projectcar,3ax8if,MyspaceIsStillCool,3,Wed Jun 24 14:10:06 2015 UTC,The swap into a six cylinder isn't just changing mounts. You have to fix the subframe as well.
projectcar,3ax8if,hateriffic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:02:07 2015 UTC,That is true. But at the same time if you are going to take on a project like the car in that picture then you should be able to handle such a job

projectcar,3ax8if,kuppajava,2,Wed Jun 24 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its not about total inches of rain a year but we get rain the most days a year. So rust would be a huge concern (which it would probably be no matter where the car has been given its state).   Thanks for the comment."
projectcar,3ax8if,docterk,2,Wed Jun 24 07:41:03 2015 UTC,"This is where I disagree.  Comparitively, I would say the PNW is pretty good as rust locations go with the light amounts of rain (daily mist, no actual inches compared to NY or Chicago) and if it has lived here it's whole life it has probably never been on salted roads, which are the worst.  That being said, like you said, rust is rust and there is no place on earth where metal doesn't oxidize."
projectcar,3ax8if,docterk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"That is a really good price for that car in the PNW and if it has been there it's entire life, it rarely if ever had to run on salted roads, and although it rains often, it is almost never the heavy kind that gets into the little internal crannies.  If you are up for the project and understand the difficulties that tend to come with someone else's project, I say get it OP."
projectcar,3ax8if,sfvalet,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"My brother and I are working on his 65' right now. There are some things you'll want to keep in mind. It's a straight 6 car so assuming you want to put a V8 in it you'll have to get all new steering (probably box because of the car's age and then the tie rod set up is different), brakes because that has drums, new spindles and hubs so it cab fit the v8 brakes, new rear end(you might be lucky with it having an 8inch or an 8.8 but you'll want to find a 9inch) then the biggest worry is rust. Frame rails frame rails frame rails. These things go out like it's there job. Make sure they're at least existent. And of course all the things that goes in with doing a V8 swap. For a grand it might not be that bad of a deal."

projectcar,3awxsp,acar87,2,Wed Jun 24 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yes all of the large wheel/rim selling websites have a function that allows you to select your car specifically, and even view the rims on your vehicle.  When you select your car most sites will give you an option to select the stock size wheel or + sizes.  Either way the tires that show up will be the proper bolt pattern.    You can also shop by bolt pattern.  For instance my 2015 F150 has a bolt pattern of  6x135mm which means technically any wheel that meets that pattern would fit. This is an over simplification because there are other factors (back spacing, diameter etc etc)."

projectcar,3awxsp,jj12321,2,Wed Jun 24 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"So when you are shopping for wheels, I would say shop around for the look that you want, and then go into somewhere like Discount Tire and let them do the hard work for you. They can most likely get any wheel that you want, and make sure you order the right wheel(bolt pattern and offset) for your car.  If you get a discount tire brand, they are still good quality, but don't offer the same high standards and designs as a good wheel company like TSW and BBS. If you like the design of the DT brand, I would say go for it.  Source: work at Discount Tire and have their wheels on my car.  P.S. if you have any other questions, ask and I will try to answer them the best I can."

projectcar,3apgn7,Iheartbaconz,0,Mon Jun 22 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"Last I heard, vin swapping is illegal. That's what you'd have to do with something like this. I know people do it, but the repercussions if the authorities find out would make the entire project not worth it. If all you have is a drivetrain, it's not enough to call it a GTO Judge. You'd have to call it a replica."
projectcar,3apgn7,pitchingataint,2,Mon Jun 22 23:55:45 2015 UTC,Literally the only way for someone to find out you've swapped vins is if you tell them. It's also a victimless crime so I doubt most people would actually care if you do it.  Edit: Nevermind it doesn't even have a title. You're fucked if you want to swap vins now.
projectcar,3apgn7,Triangullum,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"It's a victimless crime until you sell it to attempt to get your money back. Then it becomes fraud. There are MANY stories on vin swapping. From private sellers getting arrested/sued to shops getting raided. It seems like a way to make money but quite a few people take that seriously.  It's better to just leave the vins alone. Use the parts from the donor car and call it a replica. Yeah, it's a shame it's a 69 Judge, but it was a loss the second the ball joints failed and rolled the car."
projectcar,3apgn7,pitchingataint,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:45:53 2015 UTC,Is it really fraud? I mean for all intents and purposes its whatever the vin says. It's basically swapping the bodies on a car. I mean if you swap vins for the purpose of selling STOLEN cars then yeah its a problem but until then I'm fine with it.
projectcar,3apgn7,Triangullum,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"According to the law, it is fraud. The way they see it, you have one car but you are showing it as another car...which is fraud. Swapping bodies and swapping vins are seen as pretty much the same thing too. Doesn't matter if they are stolen or if you bought the car(s). Although, it varies state to state on what happens specifically, tampering in any way with a VIN is a felony.  That said, a project like this is doable if you are smart about it(like remembering there is more than one VIN tag on the car). Like you said, most of the time people won't really know unless you tell them. It's just when people find out is when the trouble starts and it could very well be bad.   E: That's not to say you can't dress the base model car as the high end car and call it a clone/replica. People and the law will understand that. Just don't touch that VIN."

I'd be starting from scratch with just the frame and drivetrain.  It seems I can get a custom title as long as it gets inspected and I have proof of how I got the parts.  It says it isn't a safety inspection so I'm not exactly sure what they are inspecting.  As far as parts goes I'd be fabricating the bodywork myself.

projectcar,3agkqx,Mikey_STX,3,Fri Jun 19 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"1"" is a huge spacer IMHO. I wouldn't recommend buying a wheel that doesn't actually fit or come extremely close.  I only use them when I have a set of wheels available or very cheap and I'm not putting much power to the ground. I wouldn't go 1"" on anything I care about.  Spacers can only lower the backspace of the wheel, so you're right on your assumption. It's moving the mating surface of the wheel (at the hub) closer to the backside of the rim by the thickness of the spacer. It's also moving the outer face of the wheel, so keep that in mind. You may get the back side perfect, but make the outside crunch the fender.  If you're going wider than stock, you'll need to know the clearance on the outside and the inside of the wheel as well. Think about what happens when the suspension is fully compressed. The wheel has to clear the outside of the fender and the inside of the wheel well.  By default most cars have the wheels set so that they are about as far out as they can be and still clear the fender. Otherwise the wheels will look like they are too far in. There's usually a little room to spare, but not a ton. As the stock wheel options get wider, they may add backspace to keep the outside flush and extend the tire back deeper into the wheel well. Make sure to check optional sizes on your car because they are a good guideline.  So it's possible that if you go wider, you'll need to up the backspacing or else you'll hit a bump and ruin your expensive tires and fender but you can't go too far back or you'll hit the inner wheel well.  If you're also changing diameters and/or lowering, you've got even more problems because the point at which the wheel will hit the wheel well changes due to all these factors."
projectcar,3agkqx,Heiroglyph,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"It's also moving the outer face of the wheel, so keep that in mind. You may get the back side perfect, but make the outside crunch the fender.   Uhhh, not if the new wheels are the same width as the original ones..."
projectcar,3agkqx,el_muerte17,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:00:57 2015 UTC,"No, but if you're keeping the same width why would you mess about with offset? If all you want is a different looking wheel with the same dimensions, just buy that. In that scenario spacers are just a I-bought-the-wrong-thing quick fix"
projectcar,3agkqx,BringElephantsNow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe the wheel style you want isn't available in your vehicle's offset?  Coming from no offset you're pretty much limited to wheels that have a deep inset centre, using spacers opens up the styles you can choose from.  Also, maybe people would rather spend a couple hundred bucks on some gently used wheels than drop a couple grand on a new set and using spacers can drastically increase their available options."

The only weakness on the factory brakes is they require some airflow if you are idling along in heavy traffic at slow speeds - they will fade on you if you are stuck in 2mph crawling traffic for an hour.   These guys are a combination of several different cars you can draw parts from. the 77-96 Chevy B-bodies are virtually identical under the skin, the 70 1/2-82 Camaro/Firebird has the same front suspension, they will take any engine or transmission you can toss at it, from a 200cu V6 to an 8.2l Caddy 500 V8.

projectcar,3a72pq,thisguy60,3,Wed Jun 17 20:47:04 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I wouldn't worry much about changing the unsprung weight in this case. I'm not so sure Ford put a heck of a lot of consideration into handling quality when they spec'd the springs and shocks for this truck. IIRC these trucks had the twin I beam front suspension designed in the early 60s when barely any OEs knew or cared about the intricies of the spring- damper relationship. Most shocks weren't even gas charged back then. Heck, Ford didn't even design in a way to adjust camber on these trucks... you literally have to bend the axles to dial in camber."

projectcar,3a72pq,hell_on_wheel,0,Thu Jun 18 04:11:41 2015 UTC,"This isn't about Ford, it's about physics, and nothing about physics has changed since the 60's.  The classic ""How to make your car handle"" was written in the mid 70's and has all the info you'll need to understand the problem: suspension is tuned to damp specific frequencies, and changing unsprung weight changes the frequency.  Gonna be an uncomfortable ride if the weight changes significantly, I guarantee you."
projectcar,3a72pq,XSharkonmyheadX,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link on info I need to understand, but I'm actually well versed in the topic. You are absolutely right in that altering any variable in any mass-spring stiffness-damper relationship will affect its resonant frequency, however the point I was making is that Ford engineers did not tune the suspension for a comfortable ride. This is a pickup truck after all, and was designed with the inherent compromise of being driven empty as well as with 500-1000 lbs of payload in the bed, and having to handle acceptably under both conditions. This is a significant compromise, in that not only did the designers have to account for changing mass, but also a non-negligble change in C of G of the truck. Since it's unreasonable to expect an operator to change the dampers and/or the springs when changing the payload, the original engineers likely selected a spring/damper combination that worked acceptably (but not ideally) for all conditions. The end result is not a fine-tuned suspension, but rather an acceptable all-around suspension.   I understand that I am speaking about sprung mass rather than unsprung mass. This is a very important distinction, but sprung mass is the primary reason an engineer would specify a spring stiffness-damper combination.   Theory aside, I have had a hand in building a few purpose-built autocross race cars, and I've personally restored a few 1950s-60s era vehicles. I have changed the wheel & tire combination on these cars and, for a typical street driven vehicle not being driven to the limit, my opinion is a typical operator will be unable to tell the difference."

All it takes is for a bit of abrasion (say from the steering column) and you'll end up with something between a short circuit and a fire.

projectcar,39yllf,applehat,10,Tue Jun 16 00:41:21 2015 UTC,"The shocks are way too long, that's what caused that. Most likely mis-boxed or the wrong part got shipped to you. I highly doubt you'll get any refund/warranty out of it from Belltech but Summit may help you. That won't fix your shock mounts though Now that they're torn like that you can:   A. Bend them back down, weld the tear up and get the right length shocks  B. Cut the stock mounts off, plate that section of frame and move the mounts up to cope with the drop and allow you a longer shock."

projectcar,39yllf,applehat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:19:37 2015 UTC,"Used to moonlight at an off-road fab shop and had jobs lined up every weekend at home for a long time on top of that and my real job. So... yeah, I weld, I've also done some pretty serious frame modification and repair.  I had to sell my machine a couple years ago so I don't work out of my own shop anymore but I've burned plenty of rod and wire. This is a pretty simple case of bend it back, clean it up and burn some wire. If it were a mount under more stress you could really go ape and cut it off, plate the frame and build a double shear mount with a normal bolt but for a non coilover shock on a street truck that's really not necessary."
projectcar,39yllf,TrikeKid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:20:58 2015 UTC,Well for you to do a job like this is pretty easy and you would have to actively try to fuck it up.  But some Cletus with a welder and no clue how to use it could probably fuck it up pretty easily.

projectcar,39yllf,-tink,6,Tue Jun 16 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on the guy doing the welding. When I used to do stuff like that out of my home shop just fixing what's there I probably would be 40-50 bucks tops. Plating and moving the mount would be more labor so probably at least double, but I was also really damn cheap when I did stuff like that.  Also, looking at your link again I noticed that the ones you listed are rear shocks, more than likely the source of your trouble unless you fumbled on the link, rears are going to be much longer."
projectcar,39yllf,shh_coffee,3,Tue Jun 16 08:30:53 2015 UTC,Wow. now I feel stupid and pissed. You're correct they are rear shocks. Now I need to go out and find myself some front drop shocks. Thanks for the help.

Just getting it running, driving and cleaning up the interior will cost you plenty.  Concentrate on that.  It looks like the front valance is rusted.  I am guessing there is more to repair.

projectcar,39tsa0,bagpipegoatee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:47:31 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure my dad said it does about 55 on the highway haha.   With a fixed up engine and a decent transmission it'll hit 70. Not on a hill... but on the flat you shouldn't have a problem hitting 65-70 without feeling like you're going to kill the car.
projectcar,39tsa0,LethargicSoap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:45:38 2015 UTC,"With the engine set right, 55 on the freeway is a good rule of thumb as it will run comfortably at that speed without feeling like it is going to cough up a lung.  I wouldn't push it much faster outside of an occasional lane change.  Also you have to remember you are running on old suspension which can go at any time unless you check it regularly."

projectcar,39utxt,torrplex,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:03:25 2015 UTC,That a pretty novel way to patch in a roust hole. Love the idea of the cardboard. Can you run me through the metal strip held on by jb weld?
projectcar,39utxt,AntiFaustianMan,0,Tue Jun 16 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"Well first you are going to want to clean the metal you are going to jb weld it to, that's pretty important. You probably want to take off that wheel, and use some stands to make working in that well safe. I cheated a bit with a camera and flashlight to check how clean the inside was.  Anyway clean it off with a degreaser, and some kind of cleaner (carb cleaner works well, pb blast does not). You can clean it off with a wire brush wheel and wipe it down with a rag. Then grind it down a bit with a grinding wheel, or a cutting wheel to get the rust off (works much faster then a wire brush, but use whatever you have...).  Once that's done you want to pick up one of those pieces of metal, a steel flat I think they are called. Anyway, get one that is nice and thick. Then use the inside of the other wheel well (if intact) and use that to bend the metal to shape, then place it in the wheel well of the rusted up one, and do any final adjustments to it's shape.  Mix up some jb weld or kwik weld (but not steel stick, not strong enough), and just paint your steel where it will attach to the remaining wheel well and clamp it into place for awhile, and you're done."
projectcar,39utxt,stukreit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"small suggestion: While you're in the business of grinding out bad metal, why not grind the open space into a regular, ovalized shape, then the template and patch will be easier to make neat and accurate.  Also- get it properly welded in."

projectcar,39t4zq,goose_hawk,3,Sun Jun 14 14:54:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree with kskaleido. I think the best way to store a car is to keep all of the components moving. I have a small collection of cars and sometimes they sit on my property for months at a time. But when I do end up taking them out, they always start right up and drive great because I kept fuel flowing through the fuel pump and carburetor. Otherwise, your mechanical components WILL stick and be a real pain for you when you get back.   I propose that you  find one of your good friends,  or family members of course, and show him around the car. Show him how to run it and start it up. While your gone for school for long periods of time, he (or she) could start it up for you once a month. That's all the car needs.     I also want to share with you a great storage tip fit all of you. When you cover your beloved with a car cover, dirt still is let in. I like to use those thin pieces of plastic that painters use and pin them to my car cover. I pick mine up and home depot or harbor freight. They come in  10' by 20' ft peices This won't let ANY dirt or dust on your vehicle. I haven't washed some of my cars in 3 years."

It's best to turn them over every once in a while."

The tires are probably going to deflate anyway, so you don't really have to bother with putting it on stands. If you're worried about the wheels and tire rods bending, I would put jackstands as a safety when the tires deflate. Just put the jackstands at the level the car sits normally and let it settle onto them over time."

One thing about plastic though, is that paint strippers and thinners can be very bad if you let the plastic soak in them. Plastic is porous enough to let it get inside it and it'll break it done internally. You may not run into any issues with it, but I caution those who see this and may try the same. Better off getting some type of buffing or scurbbin wheel of some type and using it with some paint remover applied to the scrubber and go at it your hands or with a power drill. Letting it sit in a bucket is easier, but not good for plastic."

The outer shell is a vinyl covered fiber material, the two inner pieces are plastic and leather.  The adhesive holding them together looked like it was melting away.  When I removed all the little 10mm screws holding the plastic part to the vinyl part, the whole thing fell apart.  I used acetone to clean the old glue residue from the mating parts.  Also, about half the plastic tabs holding the thing together were cracked or broken.  I used epoxy to glue everything back together, but the door card seem to have a lot of flex and give.  To add more rigidity and sound reduction, I then cut a fiberglass mat to the same size and the interior of the whole card and  mixed up a big batch of resin.  By the time I was done, the damn thing was almost bullet proof.  It was much more rigid and had no creaks.  I also ordered new interior door panel fastener clips and the whole thing is tight again.    I didn't replace the seals, but I did treat them with a silicone grease to let them plump up a bit.

It wasn't worth anything so I decided to make it a project car.  Good job so far.    I had a wicked vibration that was fixed with new motor mounts.  I also found oil in the spark plug holes that was fixed with a new set of valve gaskets.  Changing the shocks and springs wasn't hard.

projectcar,39ieyp,MikeTysonzTiger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"I had to completely disassemble the door cards, paint the plastic and vinyl pieces, then used fiber glass and resin to put it all back together.  I also replaced both the door limiter as the old ones creaked and groaned.  The biggest issue so far has been the transmission service.  The process is unreasonably complicated and I had to re-do it.  Can give you the full dramatic story if you plan to do the service too."

I like to do all my own maintenance and work.  To do a trans drain/refill in those two cars the process is easy - drain and refill.  tada!  This SLK230 is a total debutante.  She wants you to drain both the trans and the torque converter, then partially refill.  Then you get to warm her up to operating temp and slowly add more fluid until you get it just right.  If you add too much, it won't shift right.  If you don't add enough, it won't shift right.  The difference is just a few ozs. Oh, btw, they didn't include a dip stick."

projectcar,39ieyp,chocolatebananacrepe,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"I've recently been thinking about doing this for a project car, buying an older merc that most people run away from and treating it as a project rather than making it my daily immediately. Would you have any advice on it? Are they really that hard to work on?"
projectcar,39ieyp,Ecgxsmilly,2,Fri Jun 12 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to know what you're getting into ahead of time for sure and don't make any rushed decisions. Browse craigslist for a couple weeks and really get a feel for the price ranges on these cars. Some of them are so rock bottom right now that you really don't need to buy one in that rough of shape but there's going to be very little room for profit if that's your intention. If you just want a merc to enjoy I'd say go for it. I love them and people tend to greatly exaggerate how hard they are to work on. Be careful with the S classes as they really can cost a ton of money if you don't know what you're getting into. ABC suspension is a nightmare. But there are plenty of reliable models that are fun, powerful and were years ahead of their competition in quality and technology. Go for it!"
projectcar,39ieyp,MrBlaaaaah,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, making a profit isn't my biggest concern. I'm young so the thought of owning a merc is exciting, more exciting than owning a bmw or audi, plus they're cheap right now. Everyone says their money pits and you're the first person I've seen take one on as a project. Thanks again!  One more quick question: Any different opinion about the amg cars? More of a hassle? Not worth the extra money?"
projectcar,39ieyp,Ecgxsmilly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I love German cars period but Mercedes just does it for me. I love everything they make. If I were you I would get on benzworld.org and just read up on the common issues and problems of various models and see what's in your comfort level of what you can do yourself and afford. AMG has never made a bad car. I have no idea what your price range is but there aren't going to be a lot of AMG's to be found for under $10k. I would consider a slk32, a c43, a clk55 to be a good reliable starter AMG. Newer S classes are often the cheapest ones you'll find on craigslist. They really are pretty expensive to work on though. A cool car for you to consider would be a 190e. There are more desirable versions than others but you can pick one up all day for under $2k and parts are easy to come by. Plus you can make it look like this if you want to!"

projectcar,39cot3,65MercMan,5,Wed Jun 10 21:44:47 2015 UTC,I don't know much about the comet but I pulled and reinstalled the 351w in my 1970 mustang as a unit. The lift plate on the intake would not allow my engine to tilt back enough so I used bolts in the front/back face of the heads diagonally across from each other to bolt a chain across the top of the engine. I then lifted from the chain but slightly forward from the center of the engine to get the engine to tilt the way I wanted so that the transmission could slide in/out. I have a special plate with slots for chain links to stick in and not slide and a hole for the hook on the engine hoist. You should be able to get that somewhere.

I'm just about to start a diesel repower myself.  Just a bit of fair warning for people considering a project like this, the ""legality"" of these swaps is something to thoroughly research before you start. If you live in an emissions county or state, and your diesel engine was not offered by the exact manufacturer, in the same year, and same model of the chassis of your vehicle, you won't be able to register or re-register it unless it is registered as a show vehicle or offroad only, which are very strict on where and how often you drive it, depending on which one is offered.   If you don't live in an emissions county or state, this is still a fine-able offense through the EPA. They don't allow cross platform engine swaps, or an engine to be installed in a vehicle that it is even one year older than. The fine however is fairly small, so you may decide that it is still worth the risk."
projectcar,398ka8,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, good point.  We live in Ontario and the bottom half which is most populated has emissions laws.  The upper half, which is considered a non-economically developed area (too many igloos) does not need emissions tests.  Our provincial government was about to scrap the entire emissions program in the last election but decided not to.  That being said, there are no emissions police checking for conversions as it is a very rare occurrence.  The local law does not yet know the rules on what is allowed and what isn't.  Best is to keep the black smoke to an absolute minimum and keep the badges tasteful.  No giant CUMMINS sticker on the windshield."

projectcar,38z3ni,ziper1221,5,Mon Jun 8 01:41:24 2015 UTC,When do you dry sand and when do you wet sand?
projectcar,38z3ni,rantlers,15,Mon Jun 8 08:13:11 2015 UTC,"Wet vs dry sanding is mostly personal preference, and also depends on what part of the work you're doing. Personally, I don't bother with wet sanding for panel prep. I haven't run into a professional who does. It's mostly just people who have heard that wet sanding is ""better"", without much other context. It's not bad to wet sand unless you're going with too fine of a grit, it's simply not worth the time or effort.   Basic panel prep before primer work is pretty simple: rough it up to get good mechanical adhesion between the surface and your primer. That's really it. I'd throw 220 grit on a DA and buzz the whole thing in 1/4 the time or less than the time it took him to finely wet sand, and then I'd prime it and be done with it. His fine wet sanding work will not make the slightest difference under the primer, because the primer gets block sanded anyway. People seem to forget that primer isn't just ""the thing you do before paint"" as it is when you're painting the walls of your house. Primer is literally just the last step in body work. You're building on the surface and then blocking it smooth to level imperfections. This is why polyester and urethane primers are called surfacing primers.   I do sometimes choose to wet sand primer, but that's usually only when I want to take my time and make sure I have no errant scratches (under sensitive fine metallics or on higher end custom work). Or, sometimes I might wet sand because I just don't feel like getting dusty. Sometimes sanding slop is nicer to deal with than dust. In fact that's always in my opinion. That's where the personal preference comes into play. For dry sanding primer, I use 320 grit on a block, then DA sand with 400. For wet sanding primer, I use 400 grit. Both ways are perfectly good to paint directly over, there's very rarely any reason to go finer for prep work.  Once the base and clear have been sprayed and it has cured, wet sanding is the most popular way to go. 1500 grit (very sparingly), and then 2000 and 2500 grit wet are the best for clear. You certainly can't dry sand with those grits on a block, the paper would be clogged instantly and be useless. You can, however, dry sand with a DA sander with 1500 and 2000 grit. It actually works very well and it's what a lot of guys are switching to in order to save time on larger jobs. I'll then go over all of the wet sanding work with 3000 grit Trizact wet. At that points it's almost polished looking.   I hope that helps."
projectcar,38z3ni,rantlers,2,Mon Jun 8 15:56:40 2015 UTC,One question / note:  We wet-sanded the blue because that essentially WAS our primer.  We didn't shoot primer over it.
projectcar,38z3ni,rantlers,2,Tue Jun 9 01:48:48 2015 UTC,"I kind of figured that's what you probably did because there was no mention of primer. In that situation, that was the incorrect way to do the work, technically speaking. Any time you break through one layer of paint into another, surfacing primer is required. When you don't prime and then just paint directly over it, you will always see ""mapping"", where the edges of that repair area are visible through the topcoat. You really only got away with it because you sprayed a solid color, and partly because without being a refinishing industry professional, you don't have that critical eye for paint related issues. Any metallic, especially a light and fine one, and a lot of pearls will show mapping like crazy.  I think overall the car looks great. I love seeing people tackle their own paint work. As a painter who now teaches people to paint at a company that makes paint and sells restoration supplies, there are a few things i see that I'd have changed. You can probably tell i kinda live and breathe this stuff :). But that means very little to a few guys with the motivation to do the work at home just to make the car look shiny again. A+ in my book, I'm just very pedantic when it comes to things I'm passionate about."
projectcar,38z3ni,rantlers,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:39 2015 UTC,I absolutely appreciate the feedback.   What would you do next from here?  It definitely has some dust and orange peel.  I'll make a shopping list.
projectcar,38z3ni,Mo0pie,2,Tue Jun 9 11:06:11 2015 UTC,"2000 grit wet to cut down the peel and the dust and nibs, followed by buffing. I mentioned the finer 2500 and 3000 Trizact above, but those are not necessary on something like a solid red, you'll mostly likely never see the difference. Again, there's a lot of personal preference there.   You'll want to use a rotary buffer with a wool pad and rubbing compound first. Some people swear by foam for the compounding step, but foam buffs much hotter and isn't as aggressive. That can lead to ""burning"" the paint if you're going at it hard and not used to the process. Wool is a bit more aggressive, and also buffs cooler, so it's really ideal for the cutting step. Two to three applications of compound (buffed almost completely away each time) is going to remove any sand scratches you put in with the 2000 wet.   Polishing is much easier, you're not really fighting the surface to make it do anything, you're just running it over the surface to remove the fine scratches and haze from the cutting step. Some guys like to polish faster than cutting, but I'm the opposite. I like to put a little more material on the surface and run it 200-300 rpm slower than cutting and take my time with it. Again, two to three passes here just like the compound and cutting step.   You can then address any swirls you might have with a finer pad and final polish or swirl remover on the same buffer, or if you want to really do it right, the swirl removing step should ideally be done with a dual-action buffer like a detailer would use. It's easy to create swirls even in the last step with a rotary buffer if you don't really have the feel for running it flat and smooth for finish work.   For the materials, I'd recommend 3M's Perfect-It system. Their compound, polish, and swirl remover are the best I've found for refinishing work. They're pretty much the industry standard. You pay a lot for each bottle, but I think it's worth it, especially when you want to really do the work right. Another option is something like the Norton Liquid Ice system, where you use one single material but only change the pads. You don't really have the control or effectiveness that you get with the separate materials in the 3M system, but it's great if you're really concerned with the budget, it's just a single bottle to buy.   Whatever you do, make sure you use ""body shop safe"" materials. The 3M and Norton materials I mentioned above are completely silicone-free. There's nothing deposited onto the surface to fill scratches or anything. Detailing supplies are much different than refinishing supplies. Any wax or silicone that's used can ruin the paint. Wait at least 30 days to wax or seal the paint. 45-60 is actually recommended by a lot of shops, but depending on your use of the vehicle and how often it sits in direct sunlight, it will probably mildly heat-cure in 30-45 with no issues. You shouldn't feel the need to wax fresh paint because of looks, but some people can get overzealous with wanting to protect the surface. It doesn't need it yet, and if you do, you'll cause all kinds of issues."
projectcar,38z3ni,Chinampa,3,Tue Jun 9 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"This is super helpful.  For the 2000 wet, is that by hand or machine?"
projectcar,38z3ni,Chinampa,2,Tue Jun 9 13:49:14 2015 UTC,"That's by hand. You can also use a soft block like this to cut down the peel. Just wrap the paper around the block and go at it. Finger-sanding can 'dig holes' if you're not careful, so the block helps. Just make sure to watch the edges of the paper, it can dig into the paint if you let it form a sharp edge.   Another little trick is to use a spray bottle for your water instead of a bucket so that you don't pick up any debris from the bucket that will scratch up the paint. You can add a drop or two of unscented liquid soap to it for some lubrication to help the paper glide and sand smoother. The water from the bottle is completely untouched until you use it to sand, and then it just gets washed away and you use fresh water again. It's also handy to carry around instead of lugging the slop bucket. Use one of the blocks above as a soft squeegee and use fresh prep towels to wipe away the slop frequently. It also helps to dry the surface often so you can see where you have already sanded and where needs more sanding.   Thanks for the gold dude, I appreciate it!"
projectcar,38z3ni,tspangle88,2,Tue Jun 9 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"How long before I can wet sand it, in your opinion?  I'm ordering some 2000 and the soft blocks."

I once talked with a guy who painted a complete traktor in a garage without the protection and killed his tasting and smelling senses. Not cool for a 18 year old... Maybe you are able to find some books from apprentice schools?

projectcar,38z3ni,Chinampa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:14:20 2015 UTC,"I've done 3 cars (and an airplane) in a garage and my advice is to not paint it yourself. It makes an awful mess, it takes way more materials than you realize, and it makes the garage stink for a month. My current project, a 68 mustang, will have the base + clear painted at a shop.  You can do all the prep, primer, scuffing, body work, masking, etc, but it's way easier and way faster and you come out with a better job for about the same price by taking it to a pro to do the final base+clear. Like the OP said, 95% of a paint job is prep and the more of that you can do the cheaper a pro will be. You want to bring their labor bill to basically just wiping the car down and spraying the base+clear. Even the $400 Maaco base+clear will come out excellent if you bring them a well-prepped car.  You'll need to talk to them and make sure that you are using compatible products and techniques and that you take all the risks for the paint job and make it clear that you just want the paint sprayed. They won't want you to come back to them if the paint peels because you used rattle can primer from the auto store instead of the $120 stuff. Don't use the cheap auto store primer! Use the stuff they recommend."
projectcar,38z3ni,the_classifier,2,Mon Jun 8 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"Your advice of ""you need to talk to them"" makes a lot of sense, but it should be the very first step before you consider doing any work yourself.   Doing the body work and prep work yourself before taking it somewhere is really not a possibility unless you're taking it to a Maaco or some guy working in his back yard. Or, another option is if you're already in the industry and you have had lots of experience in a professional refinishing environment and you can convey that experience to the guy(s) doing the work at the shop. In fact, most painters will not even touch the car if you've done your own prep work.   Even if the correct materials are used, when a guy brings me a job that he has done body work and/or primer work on, there's a 100% guarantee that I will have to go around the car and fix all of the mistakes and spots where the work isn't done well enough. That means more labor anyway. If I didn't fix those spots, it would show through the paint. People see paint work and immediately see all of the flaws, especially wobbly body panels, pinholes, sand scratches with the wrong grit paper, edges that aren't sharp or have body filler hangs, etc. Whether I did it or not, it's going to look like I did because the paint went over it.   You'll never hear a guy admit ""Well I did the body work and primer and prepped everything and then all rantlers did is just spray over the work that I did so that stuff isn't his fault."" A guy talking to his buddies about work that was done on his car is going to simply say ""rantlers did the paint work"", and then they see the issues and assume I did those too.  If you tell me that you're going to bring me a car that's all ready to be shot, I'll just politely refuse the work. I personally will not sign my name to work that someone else did a part of. It's just not worth my small shop's good reputation.   There are too many unknown factors, too much misinformation out there for people to follow, and far too many people who simply just don't have the level of attention to detail that's required to do professional quality refinishing work. That's not saying you don't, but easily 99% of the people who think they know what they're doing with paint and body work actually have no idea, and they do far more damage than they are even aware of."
projectcar,38z3ni,Chinampa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:08:02 2015 UTC,"Everything you say is true. I was trying to say it's just not worth it to try and paint in a garage, especially if you're going for base+clear (been there done that). Some guys are happy with rolled on implement paint though. I'm not.  The amount of effort and prep and nastiness and materials just makes it not worth it. I spent 6 months researching materials, tools, and supplies. In the end the paint job was mediocre at best.  The average DIY guy just doesn't realize how nasty that stuff really is (especially the clear, ugh). And it takes thousands of dollars in supplies and tools to even get to a point where you can think about spraying a decent job.   The average DIYer's air compressor will start spitting water half way through the clear coat. They'll try to use the HF purple gun and get crazy orange peel. They won't have the proper VOC filters on the mask or use a fresh air system. They won't grab the tyvek suits and eye protection. They won't look up the TDS or assume they can substitute materials. By the time you get everything in order you've spent well north of $1k that won't really be useful for anything other than painting.  I was just trying to say don't blindly go and attempt a DIY paint job. Go talk to a pro painter and see what you can do to save money but let them do the hard work."

projectcar,38z3ni,LethargicSoap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"The average DIYer   This guy is evolving, and you aren't giving enough credit to this type of guy. The average DIYer is not what he was even five or ten years ago. There's so much solid info out there, and there are so many products designed with the DIYer in mind, it's very unlikely anyone is just going to grab a HF gun and some shitty paint and just wing it. Companies like the one I work for are directing tons of info right at the DIY paint and body guy. That's why I have a job right now - the guys doing that kind of work at home.   It's absolutely possible, and it's not at all dangerous or sketchy or bad in any way. You simply need to take a little while to research, make the right phone calls or send the right emails when you have questions, and then buy quality stuff. That's the other thing, it's not even close to as expensive as you make it seem to do quality work safely at home.   A low-CFM draw paint gun from a reputable company is going to cost you under $200. That allows you to use the gun on a small home compressor which might only output air at a lower CFM rate. Most people already have a compressor like this, but if not, they're $180 at HF. A standard 50 ft air hose ($30) with a Devilbiss Desiccant snake ($30) at the end of it and a short whip hose off the end of that ($10) gets you clean, dry air on a tight budget with minimal purchases.   A dual cartridge respirator is $20. A disposable paint suit is $10. A box of gloves is $5. These are not things that most people skip, whether you think they do or not. The info is out there telling them they need it, so they specifically ask about it and then purchase it.   As far as the materials being ""nasty"", yeah the catalyzed materials can contain isocyanates. However, with the proper respirator and suit, there's virtually no risk whatsoever. It's easy to plan around. Even if you're painting in a garage with little ventilation, you can easily use box fans and set up a positive pressure ventilation system (air blowing in rather than sucking out across the exposed motors of the fans) to clear out the fumes with no explosion risk. You don't even need to filter the outgoing air if you don't want to. The EPA 6H rule allows you to paint up to two full vehicles per year in open air with no filtration. There's not even a legal risk.   With no equipment at all, you can buy everything (including the compressor) for about $500. The only thing that's single-purpose is the paint gun. With that setup above, I can produce a SEMA-worthy show vehicle in a single car garage, guaranteed. It's all about the prep, setup, and finish work. Of course a lot of that is because I have the knowledge to do so efficiently and cleanly, but that info is available to anyone. It's really not as difficult as you make it seem at all."
projectcar,38z3ni,SicilSlovak,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:50:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe I've just had bad experiences then. I used a similar compressor to that with inline desiccant filters (the snake wasn't available then) in an air conditioned garage and it spit water. It ran so much that the reed valve came off and had to have the bolt tapped out and replaced. I now have a much larger compressor that has zero water problems.  I had 4 fans blowing in and 2 out for positive air pressure. I still couldn't see when shooting the clear. Which lead to orange peel and a few sags and runs.  I followed the TDS sheets to the letter and it came out great on the engine bay. The entire car was a bit more of a challenge mostly due to not being able to see.  What products do you recommend for the DIYer? It's been about 10 years since I last shot color on a car. I've shot Martin-Senour and Kirker and some PPG products. I'd actually like to shoot the mustang but I live in a neighborhood that probably wouldn't take too kindly to it.  It's a whole new world of paints out there with all of the VOC regs and water borne paints. I recently used some of the martin-senour cross/fire single stage stuff to paint some aluminum cowling and it seems like it doesn't flow as nice as it used to.  I've used various primers with the SPI epoxy being my favorite (though don't get it near phosphoric acid). Evercoat rage gold for the filler (I've tried bondo, 3m, and another brand but the Evercoat is the best I've used by far).  What are your thoughts on slick sand? Worth it? I've seen mixed reviews."

projectcar,38z3ni,TheOtherMatt,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:09:33 2015 UTC,"An hour of labor time does not get you a taped up car. An hour is what it might actually take to correctly mask an entire vehicle, but that's not what they're going to charge you. Billed hours and actual physical time it takes to do the work are only loosely related. For a flat rate painter or prepper, if the job bills out an hour for masking, you're expected to do it in 5/10ths (30 min) or less. Most guys like to shoot for 3 or 4 10ths for a billed hour. Even an hourly guy is going to be held to at least a 200% efficiency standard. The same concept applies to shops when they write estimates. If a guy writing an estimate thinks it's going to take a real-world 30 minutes to do the work, he's going to bill it at a full hour to allow for issues that are almost certain to arise.   320 grit straight scratches are different than DA scratches. 320 on a DA is fine enough to base right over with any color, even fine metallics. 320 straight is actually a bit rougher, in which case you might need to go 320 wet or even up to 400 like you mentioned. Ultimately it's decided by the sealer and/or base coat. You always need to read the Tech Data sheet to see what each material must be shot over."

THEN use bondo to smooth the metal for finishing (I prefer to do this after priming with epoxy, but some like to do it before).  I also read a lot of ""I'll use spray foam""  EVEN WORSE IDEA.  That stuff is open celled and LOVES water. It is how to make your car a rust bucket in a few years - from the inside out. Terrible idea. It adds almost no structural strength... so why do it?

Butt/crimp connectors are poison...a nightmare if someone else did them all.. really not worth the hassel later and possible breakdown.  I had a swapped car with butt connectors in the main harness (previous owner)..  Constant headache, hit a bump and get a check engine light..  Best option, (and what I did) one by one, verify the wiring with a service manual wiring diagram and redo the connections by soldering them together and using heatshrink over them.  This will be very reliable if done correctly.  It really won't take as long as you would think to do.   Could you elaborate on what wiring issues you think you may have?  Other option is throw the project on a train and get it shipped to where your moving."

He had the injector resistor wired up with wing nuts and that was one of the first things i did was replace those and properly solder them.   One issue I'm having is that when I did have power to my ecu, I was attempting to get the fuel pump working when the ecu wanted it to. I took my fuel pump relay wire from the ecu, ran it to the passenger side of the car, hooked it to the relay. Then I took a 10 gauge wire from the battery to the relay. There's a black with a white stripe wire that'd supposed to be a key ON live wire. Its got power all the time. And the ecu is not telling the relay wire when to come on, so its not completing the circuit and allowing my fuel pump to kick. I just charged the battery over night so I'm hoping that will help with my ecu problem."
projectcar,38zk7n,flak_jack,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:37:01 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping that fixes it.  Check all your grounds.  Could also check to see of the ecu is not sending out the +12v to the relay, or perhaps the relay is bad or perhaps there's a wiring issue in between the ecu and pump.   I'd focus on getting power back to the ecu, and then get the pin out and start testing the ecu with a test light.  I have had a similar problem on a Honda ecu before (p06 that was running a different ems) basically the ecu would randomly refuse to fire the fuel pump.  Main relay was fine, but the ecu wouldn't send out the +12volts to engage it.  Once it sat overnight it would fire right up one time and then back to the same issue.  I changed the ecu out for a spare and the car is still going on that ecu with no issues as far as I know."
projectcar,38zk7n,flak_jack,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"As of last night the ecu wasn't getting any power and I couldn't figure out why...   I charged the battery over night and I'll be checking it today to see if I have power again.  When it did have power, the ecu wasn't sending the 12v to the fuel pump relay so my pump wouldn't come on.. I'm bypassing the original wiring for the fuel pump. I have a power wire coming from the pump to the front of the car, to the relay. I'm using the fuel pump relay wire as the switched ground for the relay. I have another 12v source coming straight from the battery and there's a black and white wire in a brown plug that's supposed to be hot when on and its hot all the time, but i was supposed to use it as a trigger to the relay.  I really hope its not a bad ecu D:.   I really appreciate the help you're giving me! Thank you!"

That will look fantastic!  For the most part the body is clean so you won't have to mask much off, so keep it straight and simple and do it right away.  Use body filler to patch the emblem and trim holes for now and you can drill them back out later if you change your mind and want to put the trim back on.  Lastly, spend money and get a really nice new color-matching aftermarket grill for it."

projectcar,38htd8,KowalskiTheGreat,5,Fri Jun 5 12:22:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like I had a stroke reading that... WTF are you talking about.  I know all those words, but the sentences are...baffling.... Your truck starts on 1 cylinder?  Or you think it's a good idea to fire all at the same time?  Multispark is really not going to net you much, but hey, it sounds like you know just enough to be dangerous to that stepside of yours."
projectcar,38htd8,Liquid_Beaver,3,Thu Jun 4 13:40:19 2015 UTC,Yes of course
projectcar,38htd8,titanshub,2,Thu Jun 4 12:08:48 2015 UTC,"Okay so none of this makes sense, but maybe I have been living under a rock and everything I am about to say is wrong.  If you fired all your cylinders off at once to ""start"" (or at any time while running) your truck, top dead center, bottom dead center, and mid-stroke pistons would all being firing at once, pushing pistons in opposing directions causing catastrophic damage immediately. The reason your truck fires ""one at a time"" is because you have to have rhythm (i.e. firing order) in order to keep your internals from exploding. Even when it is a little bit off it can shake the ever living fuck out of your engine, when it's farther off it could light a spark plug with an open exhaust or intake valve, in which case you get fireballs out of the exhaust or your intake.  This is not the same as active fuel management, that turns off fuel and ignition to exactly half of however many cylinders the engine has, because that is the only possible way to retain the rhythm of the firing order. This type of system is designed into an engine management system from the very beginning, and is a fairly new innovation.  If you are talking a stronger spark so you can more thoroughly burn the fuel in your cylinder, allowing you to then ease up on the amount of fuel you are putting into each cylinder resulting in better gas mileage potential, an MSD type box is the most effective way to do this safely."
projectcar,38htd8,Gyp_Sum,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"Well technically speaking, it wouldn't ever be able to fire all cylinders at once because it violates the principles of the 4 stroke engine, but I understand what you were trying to say :).   How a 4 stroke engine works for the OP."
projectcar,38htd8,kim_attree,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:33:10 2015 UTC,"You're taking about essentially something like a msd or summit ignition box correct? Or is it something else? Cause as far as I can remember that generation used distributors still, and what your describing (firing on all cylinders at once if I'm reading that right) isn't possible with a distributor unless there's a problem with the cap, as far as I know."
projectcar,38htd8,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:24:04 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about ""wasted spark"" ?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_spark"
projectcar,38htd8,Cephalapodus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:13:30 2015 UTC,"Wasted spark:       The wasted spark system is an ignition system used with some four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines. In a wasted spark system, the spark plugs fire in pairs even though one is on its compression stroke and one is on its exhaust stroke. The extra spark on the exhaust stroke has no effect and is thus ""wasted"". This design halves the number of components in a typical ignition system, while the extra spark, against much reduced dielectric resistance, barely impacts on the lifespan of modern ignition components. In a typical engine, it requires only about 2–3 kV to fire the cylinder on the exhaust strokes. The remaining coil energy is available to fire the spark plug under compression (typically about 8 to 12 kV).

projectcar,38htd8,texan01,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"Wasted Spark and the SMSM device you posted earlier are completely different beasts.  Wasted spark generates zero additional power and has nearly no detriment (aside from possibly accelerated sparkplug wear).  SMSM, as described above, again has zero additional power, but fucks with your ignition system, delaying ignition and adds a shitton of cost and complexity to a system that really doesn't need it.  If you want modern ignition, buy an MSD box, or a newer engine.  your truck doesn't use breaker points.  Those went away in the 70s or 80s.  Your truck ALREADY has an electronic ignition module, that went through a significant amount of engineering and development.  Leave well enough alone.  Your truck does not start on ""one cylinder"" and firing all cylinders simultaneously can cause catastrophic engine failure."

This was the last year for the unibody F100 and the vin number puts this one as being made in January of 1963, and the 1,864th one made that year, of the 40,000 or so. For the exception of the wheels (those will soon change), this truck is bone stock. It's got the original 223 six cylinder and 3 speed manual. Typical rust in a few spots as this truck was used as a farm truck its entire life, with 43,000 miles on the clock. I have $1,000 in it and hope to make it my daily driver eventually.

projectcar,386tb3,CapturetheBomb,2,Tue Jun 2 07:05:15 2015 UTC,"Depending on how long it has been since your car ran, don't just blindly try and fire it up. If it has been long enough that the gas had to be drained, take the time to at least drop the oil pan and clean out any sludge that might be in there. It sounds like you don't want to do a full rebuild right off the bat so you want to be sure when you crank it for the first time its not going to be pushing debris around and damaging the motor.   For compression you probably don't want to venture any higher than around 8.5 if that. Unless you want to race the car it won't pay to build a high compression six cylinder, especially if you want it to be very drive-able.   The CSC site's chart (which is where I assume you got the 2000 range) is a dyno sheet. It is only showing the power output across the 2000-8500 range. Everything below 2000 they left out because in terms of power there isn't a whole lot to see there. It appears that cam is pretty similar to the stock one so your idle will be in the range of 800-1200.   If it was me I'd put a 9 inch in. They're widely available and they just won't break. Plus if you decide down the road to put a V8 in you won't have to change it. If you do go with the 9"" unless you are hard set on 4 lugs I would just transition to five. It's more to do but then you don't have to worry about someone possibly making you a bad axle.    Lastly you mentioned porting. On that motor you won't see any significant gains in power to make it worth while. Typically that is something done on a race motor to squeeze out the last few horses."
projectcar,386tb3,jfline,2,Tue Jun 2 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"The car ran about 6 years ago after sitting empty since 1999. A little bit of fuel was put into it with new oil, and it ran for a bit before being emptied again. We weren't sure what was going to be done with it, and couldn't let it go.  Would you recommend a rebuild first for safety? This is going to be a multiple year project and I got 2 other cars to drive, so downtime doesn't worry me.  I've seen some builds with compression ratios of 9.5-10. Here are similar builds with the 3 speed auto (9.5), a T-5 swap (9.5), and another T-5 with less compression (8.7). I would like to do some sort of racing with it, either autocross or HPDE. If I was to mimic the 9.5 C/R T-5 build (assuming 22% power loss from the crank), it would have a better power to weight ratio (10.37 lbs/hp) than the E36 M3 (13.33 lbs/hp), and slightly less than the E46 M3 (10.21 lbs/hp).  This is where I spotted the range for the cam. I don't assume it would be an issue for a slight performance cam.  I thought about doing the swap before, but I am attached to the idea of a 4 lug Mustang. The diff shouldn't go out easily from what I've read, but it's always good to have a backup plan. I don't mind spending a little more money to keep the stock wheels on it, especially after having them refinished and dipped in black industrial paint when the brakes were going to stay drums.  Would any type of porting hurt its performance? Again, I'd like to squeeze out any extra power I can, even if it is not for a little while."
projectcar,386tb3,jfline,2,Tue Jun 2 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"Just doing a rebuild right away is the safe option. Obviously there's time and money that goes into that. If you're waiting for the cash to do a rebuild and you want to drive it in the mean time, there is no problem waiting to do the rebuild. I just caution it because I have seen people let their cars sit for a a couple years then when they're ready to get it going again they start it up and a whole new mess of problems occurs. Obviously there are a lot of factors to that but things that stay still for a while sometimes like to stay that way. Doing the rebuild right away also gets the engine out so the engine bay can be cleaned up and painted, if so desired. There's obviously a tremendous amount of options here that you can do.   Those HP numbers are at the wheels so I'm guessing you're trying to get the power at the crank then? I didn't mean to knock the higher compression build, it will get the horsepower you want but maybe not the mileage. I was thinking you were looking to do more of a daily build than a race build. There is nothing wrong with going that high on the compression at all.   Yeah that's where the power band will be. Idle will still be in a normal range.   Then keep the four lugs. Its an awesome look especially on early mustangs. I have just never hear about replacement four lug axles for the 9"" so I just have absolutely no idea about the quality.   Done wrong, like anything, could hurt performance, done right though it will give you a little gain. The idea behind it is that it decreases turbulence so that the engine breathes better. It can be done by a good motor shop sometime down the road you'll just have to pull the head off."

projectcar,382sbo,VicVoss,4,Mon Jun 1 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"Correct, as you can see in the images, the hub is part of the strut so you can't separate them.  ""Turnaround time for coilover conversions is approximately 2 weeks (often times less)."" - Taken from the item description on the website."
projectcar,382sbo,Call_Me_ZeeKay,4,Mon Jun 1 14:10:25 2015 UTC,I was going to ask about this too. I can't think of any other car I've ever seen where the hub is integrated into the strut.
projectcar,382sbo,karmavorous,4,Mon Jun 1 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's a bit of an odd-ball design, you'll have to ask the Toyota engineers why they chose to go that way.  I can see how it saves weight but obviously if you break a spindle you're replacing the whole strut.  Thankfully there are people like T3 now who make aftermarket parts for these cars so replacements and upgrades are feasible."
projectcar,382sbo,Call_Me_ZeeKay,7,Mon Jun 1 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"Like I said elsewhere in this thread, the one-piece strut like that is just the old way of doing it.  If you bent your spindle, you wouldn't have to replace the whole strut. You'd only have to replace the strut tube and the spindle.   In your pictures you can see that the top of the strut tube is a giant hex or octagonal flange. That's actually a giant bolt with a hole in the center for the strut rod to come through.  You can remove that nut with a pipe wrench and slide the old hydraulic strut out. And you end up with one piece that like your spindle with the strut tube. No moving parts left at the point.   That part is/was probably cheaper than if you had a more modern strut design and bent the spindle and had to replace that whole casting with the spindle, steering arm, and ball joint receiver.   If your strut tube was not bent, then your hydraulic shock damper would probably be reusable. And your bolt-on steering arm would be reusable. You'd just have to replace the strut tube/spindle assembly.  The struts that people are more familiar with today  - with the strut as one part and the knuckle/spindle/steering arm/ball joint receiver as a second part - are the newer method of doing things. Those came around in the late 1970s on FWD appications (like the VW Rabbit) where they had to make room behind the ""spindle"" for the CV joints.   Also casting a complicated part (with the ""spindle"" and steering arm and ball joint receiver) became cheaper around the same time because of advances in (or at least reduction in cost of) more advanced casting technologies."

projectcar,382sbo,karmavorous,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I like the little gusset they add to increase the support on the hub."
projectcar,382sbo,berberlevin,5,Mon Jun 1 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"Making the hub separate from the strut is something that came around about the same time as front-wheel-drive became the norm.  I had a whole bunch of  RWD Datuns and Nissans from 1968 to 1988 and they all one-piece struts like that.  I converted my 510 to coil-overs the same way.  If you're going for low ride height, you can cut the strut tube down to use A1 VW Rabbit strut inserts which are much shorted than the typical one-piece strut insert, and you can adjust your damper stroke with spacers below or above the strut insert (if you leave a couple of inches in tube length when you shorten them).  You can also easily adjust roll center and eliminate torque steer on these - because while the hub is connected to the strut tube directly, the steering arm is a bolt-on piece below the hub and the balljoint connects to the steering arm.  So if you put a spacer between the hub and steering arm that is equal in height to the amount of ride height you eliminated above the hub, then you end up with factory steering and roll-center geometry on a lowered car.  TechnoToyTuning sells spacers to accomplish that.  The same thing does not work on newer style struts that have the steering arm, the hub, and the ball-joint receiver all on the same cast part."
projectcar,382sbo,TrikeKid,2,Mon Jun 1 14:49:24 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the info.  You're exactly right, they cut the strut tube and rework the damper stroke for the shorter travel.  T3 also makes some RCA adjusters which I will also add.  Looking forward to this project because I can actually learn about suspension geometry and put it into practice."
projectcar,382sbo,solbrothers,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks like a fun project. Makes me nostalgic for my old Datsuns.  In the old days, if you wanted to replace your ""shock"" (correct term is damper) you had to remove that giant bolt from the top of the strut tube put the new insert inside of it.  The old stock dampers were not gas charged. They just had oil in them, and you could tune your shocks by putting heavier weight oil inside of them or by welding shut some of the orrifices that the oil passed through.  Some time in the 1980s, gas charged struts became a big thing and replacement shocks for those old struts became gas charged ""inserts"" that you replace your old oil dampers with.  VW Rabbits had very limited suspension travel in the front because the strut tube was so short to make room for the CV joint. As a result, many many people who modified their suspension on Toyotas and Datsuns would use VW rabbit strut inserts (Koni mostly) because they were so short.  My guess is that T3 just does that as a ""service"".  When I read that you were sending yours away to have it done, I though ""damn, I wish someone offered that as a service when I did mine""... riding around on strut tubes you welded yourself was pretty scary for the first few thousand miles..."
projectcar,382sbo,solbrothers,2,Mon Jun 1 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I can imagine ""are these dampers going to blow if I hit a big pot hole?!""  At first I considered having a local shop do the work on the struts but then just decided to splurge and have T3 do it, their quality is excellent and I love the little flourishes they add like the welded gusset plate and the technotoytuning engraving.  Suspension, brakes, and tires are not places to skimp out on in my opinion."
projectcar,382sbo,berberlevin,2,Mon Jun 1 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn more about suspension geometry, this series of articles is excellent  These were originally printed in the now-defunct Sport Compact Car Magazine. Mike Kojima is a genius and really explains everything in a way that's easy to understand.  There's a lot of stuff you can tune on those ""older"" style strut suspensions. They're much cooler than they seem. It's kinda one of those things where the modern conventional way of doing things (the two-piece strut that all modern cars have) is more of a cost-cutting thing and the older way is superior in a lot of ways... at least if you like to tinker with it...  IDK if T3 makes different steering arms for the Toyota, but I have seen them for the old Datsuns. You can make your steering sharper (quicker steering ratio) without replacing the steering rack (or box).   You can't do that (or adjust the roll center) with a modern strut design..."

The weaker vacuum signal on the 750 will make it harder to tune for everyday driving. Our spec class 355"" motors made over 500hp with a 650cfm carb, so your stock 360 doesn't need anywhere near that CFM and it just makes it unpleasant to drive.   You can put a 4 hole carb spacer under it to help with the vacuum signal."

projectcar,385wpu,lsx2,2,Tue Jun 2 05:17:48 2015 UTC,"What did you change?  For starters, get a basic vacuum gauge and hook it up to the lower small port on the front of the carb, then in very small increments adjust the two idle mixture screws until you obtain the highest vacuum reading on the gauge. This should make a decent improvement on your off-idle transition and throttle response.   Second, the vacuum gauge will also tell you what springs you need to use for the metering rods to get them to pop up at the right time.   Third, unless you take it to a dyno shop you're going to just have to play with the actual metering rod size and jets, smell, judging how it reacts, reading plugs, etc..."
projectcar,385wpu,lsx2,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:22:04 2015 UTC,Haven't changed anything aside from mix screws. On the second part of that how do determine what size springs from the vacuum? Also sorry for my ignorance i'm not to familiar with the internals of carbs!
projectcar,385wpu,lsx2,2,Tue Jun 2 05:28:55 2015 UTC,"You'll need to buy the tuning kit for your carb - in it will be a small tuning manual that tells you how to use the vacuum reading to select the proper spring. You need one soft enough that the idle and off-idle vacuum keeps the metering rods dropped down into the jets. Too stiff for your vacuum and it will be running at the metering rod's rich step at all times. You should be able to find the kits based upon your carb's part number through the Summit website, or get the kit from a local speed shop."

It is going to have plenty to work on by default, but it wouldn't necessarily be an overwhelming, fun killing amount like a ground up project can be.  You can use the same advice people use for significant house repairs on old project cars: However much time you think it is going to take, and how much money it will cost (car, tools, safety equipment, parts, etc..), triple them both. If those are numbers you are still comfortable with, by all means jump on in!  You will gain more knowledge than you ever thought possible, and it will stay with you for the rest of your life.  And remember, consulting an expert over something you can't figure out should never be something to be ashamed of. They could save you money at the worst, or your life at the best.  Once you find a car you like, try to find a forum dedicated to them. One exists for every car that's ever been made, and there is a wealth of hands-on knowledge there. A lot of manufacturer's books help with how things are intended to work, but not much help when they aren't working at all.  I'm now on my 4th car build, and I can say without a doubt that it is the single most rewarding feel I have had in my entire life, and I get to feel it over and over again every time I drive it.  Edit: Rat Rods are a badass first choice!  Advice: When diagnosing problems, start with the cheapest solution first. If it ends up not working, you spent the least money.

Hopefully it's something that is common and has a bunch of videos on youtube to guide you on repairs.    Other than that, your plan seems solid.  Have a truck for truck things, have a car for car things, have a wagon for SUV-ish things in a car.  Obviously the last two things can be combined."

projectcar,37noo1,marble_god,4,Fri May 29 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"The EZ EFI looks interesting, care to tell more about it?"
projectcar,37noo1,Aboreal,1 point,Fri May 29 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"The EZ EFI is a stand alone EFI kit offered from FAST fuel injection. Its a throttle body system that is closed loop and self learning. I used the complete kit and it came with everything I needed for the install. If you are using this kit for a carb conversion you will have to plumb in a return fuel line and route the wiring harness and install a O2 sensor, thats about it..... in theory. Now the original EZ EFI, like the one that I have, controls your fuel only, no spark control. The new FAST EFI system controls both the fuel as well as your spark. The user of the new system can customize the spark curve as well as timing right from the handheld controller. Hind sight, I should have went with the second,newer system. Had I done this could have tweeted the spark curve and timing with the handheld rather than making changes to my spark curve manually with different springs, then tuning the EFI to match. Then making a change to my timing then the EFI tuning to match. Ultimately I think I got to the same end tuning result, but was more cumbersome to get to.  The system I have has 4 injectors that will support up to 650hp and like I mentioned above is self learning to adapt to your engine. So if you are like me, and want to continually upgrade and change your engine (cam,heads intake etc) you don't have to send your system back to have it reprogrammed or be a wiz on a laptop and know the ins and outs of EFI, you can simply make the changes yourself on the handheld provided with the system. The issues I had with the install and tuning were to do with EMI or interference with the signals the system was receiving. EMI can come from a ""noisy"" or poorly insulated ignition wire too close to the EFI wiring or from bad grounds or even a ""noisy"" coil. Well to make a very long story short I ended figuring out my issues all came from a faulty MSD ignition box sending my EFI a messy, erratic RPM signal. How did I figure this out? By spending WAY too much time on online forums and trying about everything anyone else has found as a solution to their similar issues one by one. Once I eliminated about every thing in the system BUT the ignition box I made the leap and bought a new MSD 6AL box and at last, problem solved."

projectcar,37noo1,breakfastfire,5,Fri May 29 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"I have it set up right now for power, I have the A/F ratio set at 13.4:1 while cruising and 12.7:1 wide open throttle. The engine loves it, its hard to keep back tires on it but fuel mileage is... well terrible. I had changed it to 15:1 for a while and it makes a huge difference for gas milage  thats for sure. Thats whats so cool about the system, you can change it in seconds to suit the kind of driving you want.  Is it worth the cost? Yeah I would say it is, it took me a few months to get a few gremlins worked out but it is making all the grey hairs worth while now driving the shit out of it. If you end up buying one contact me I can give you some hints that will save you a lot of headaches."
projectcar,37noo1,Deflepperdsucks,4,Fri May 29 03:03:01 2015 UTC,"Very cool. Is the tank in your truck bed your new gas tank or does that just get fed the returned fuel. If so, I guess that means you manually have to transfer it back to the ""supply"" fuel tank?  Also, do you plan on rust proofing the rest of the frame with like POR-15 or something?"
projectcar,37noo1,DutchUncleMike,5,Fri May 29 03:28:48 2015 UTC,The tank in the bed is my only gas tank. The fuel goes out to the engine with a high pressure pump then the unused fuel (if any) returns to the tank. This is to keep a constant pressure to the EFI and to make sure that you are not dead heading the pump. Yes I will eventually take the entire body off the frame and POR the entire frame. That is the long term plan anyway.

Before you go any further, make out a list of jobs you plan to do and make a battle plan!  Most cars that end up as just parts in peoples garages start this way, the guy just tears apart the car and then gets overwhelmed when life gets in the way.    Before you tear it down any further, do the paperwork!  Start with all of the books and resources you need to make a plan and make it!  Get a map of your car and number your jobs and put the numbers on the map so your project has a beginning, measured out steps in the middle, and an end to this phase of the project.    Maybe I am wrong and you have already done this or have your own way of doing it, but if you don't please consider doing more project prep before going ahead.

projectcar,37oufg,kuppajava,1 point,Sun May 31 08:48:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, your saving graces there are that: One - you aren't building it alone Two - you have a plan even if it is an outline Three - it sounds like there is a timeframe that requires it being out of the garage    That being said - If you haven't personally done a full project before, now would be a great time to start doing it right so you do it this way from now on.  Even where you are, create a build sheet and write down what you have already done in detailed steps and what you plan to do so that you can check things off a list that are done and still have an official end point to work with.  I have done ""friend projects"" before and even though we never just let them sit as parts, they did always get confused and have mission creep if we didn't have a master plan.  It seems like you have a pretty good overall plan, but consider writing it down, if for no other reason so that you have documented everything you have done."

I believe I pushed it too far, add a few pebbles in the braking area and the rear end came around on me. The incline and curvature of the road can't be made out from the video but it was weird and I was in the wrong part of the road too.  It's an F20c from an early s2000. Bike engine builds are fun - especially in autocross but once I got in to hillclimbing I've had a need for more power - 300+ to the wheels is what one of these needs. add some aero and it would be manageable at about 400hp."

It just covered up your scratches. Black cars usually are 3 steps minimum if you color sand.   you also never wax a car until the paint is fully cured/all the gasses have escaped. usually about a month.  Also you never hold a buffer on its side/edge like that. you hold it flat and put 3-4 lbs of pressure on the middle of the pad. I saw black on your pad after you were done, so you went through the clear coat with that 800 grit sand paper huh? we use minimum 1500 grit in body shops, 800-1000 if meant for if you have a run in the paint/clear."

projectcar,37iz6l,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Thu May 28 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind with the impact and the bolt, the air supply to the impact is as important as the impact gun.  If your using a long run of 3/8 line to the impact you aren't getting the flow to it that it probably requires.  I only mention it because I had the same problem with a crankshaft pully nut.  I stuck a six foot section of 1/2 line directly from the compressor to the impact, and spun the nut off of the pulley so fast it spun across the shop."
projectcar,37iz6l,Drift_Kar,1 point,Fri May 29 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I have a very small compressor. It's only interesting that it didn't work, because the air impact allowed me to take off the 54mm nut on the flywheel.I figured if I could take a 54mm flywheel factory torqued to 350 lbs, I could take a front pulley bolt that was supposed to be torqued to 200 lbs."
projectcar,37kvca,LightRWDManual,3,Thu May 28 11:03:43 2015 UTC,"If you want to do these projects right, don't include the welding gear in this budget unless you raise it. With all the things you have listed, unless you are going to buy every single other piece on sale at Harbor Freight, you are only left with ~$500 or less for welding gear, which is barely enough for the safety equipment alone, much less the actual welder and supplies.  For the jack stands and jack, Harbor freight is amazing. I use their full-steel, lifetime guaranteed, 3 ton low profile floor jack and the 6 ton (3 tons each) pair of jack stands, and they are fantastic. I wish I had them when I did my other projects because they are saving me 1/4 of the time I used to spend repeatedly jacking up multiple points on the car to move around under it. I just go under the frame of my Chevelle right now (~3 inches off the ground) and I can lift any side high enough to crouch under if I wanted to. The jack and stands, when used together, are stable enough that I can push sideways on the car with the front end two feet in the air and it doesn't even sway.  You are going to need some good rubber tire chocks, but those are only ~$20 or so.  Don't underestimate the recurring cost of cleaning supplies, and other perishables. Oil, carb or brake cleaner, shop towels if you need them, oil dry, WD-40, rubber gloves, pumice hand cleaner, etc.. all add up quickly.  Like Def said, an air compressor is great if you are going to be doing a lot of grinding, or impact work. If it is light work (i.e. not really any grinding) then wireless impact drivers are pretty useful.  I recommend an engine stand as well. An engine crane is not the same thing, and for the price (Harbor Freight) it will save you a LOT of time and frustration being able to do engine work on the stand instead of only in the car. I just got a new engine in my car and just the stand alone probably saved me 6 hours of work by speeding up the process.  If you've never taken out an engine before, or even if you have, I suggest a load leveler to go along with your engine crane. You lose some height, but gain some fine tuning of the pitch of the engine/tranny that is nearly impossible without it.  I would strongly suggest Ziploc bags and containers for small parts. You take off a piece, you put it and the fasteners in a bag and label it. You will be so happy that you did.  Do yourself a favor and get some mechanics coveralls. Not only do they keep you from destroying other clothes, but you will be a lot more comfortable and safer. Get some boots (steel toed if you can), and mechanics gloves while you are at it.  If you are going to be grinding a lot, you need a respirator or other type of mask, as well as safety glasses.  There is a ton of other stuff I can suggest if I can get a better idea of what all you want to do."
projectcar,37kvca,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Thu May 28 15:54:25 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll budget welding gear separately.  I've always been taught not to trust hydraulics to hold things up and am going for 780mm reach axle stands @ 3 ton each for good ground clearance as I don't have access to ramps.  Rubber chocks, thanks.  Cleaning/consumables is in a separate budget for easier adjustment as and when required.  Load leveler, thanks.  I've got a load of ice cream tubs with lids to put screws and bits in - labels too.  Got overalls and boots, plan on getting gloves, respirator, goggles etc too.  Will be mainly fairly big projects - engine and/or drivelive transplants, kit cars etc.  Will be getting an estate car as a daily for parts transport."
projectcar,37kvca,Liquid_Beaver,2,Thu May 28 16:32:18 2015 UTC,"You are correct with not trusting hydraulics alone to hold things up.   Jack up the car, get the jack stands under it, lower the jack just enough to put weight on the jack stands to verify that they settle stable, and then you have jack stands AND the jack bearing the weight, instead of just one or the other. This is much safer.  Always have backups for anything bearing weight. Old tires, wooden planks, an old wheel, anything for added security. You never want to only count on jack stands either."
projectcar,37kvca,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Thu May 28 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"At a minimum the cars will be on 4 X 3 ton axle stands, I've heard too many horror stories of hydraulic valves giving up a inopportune times."
projectcar,37kvca,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Thu May 28 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"This is a great setup, and for added security, whatever side you are working on put the jack underneath until it just barely touches the frame or axle. That way if a jackstand fails, and they can, you have the jack to help out too."
projectcar,37kvca,Liquid_Beaver,1 point,Thu May 28 16:58:36 2015 UTC,"As a separate safety suggestion, it's a good idea to only do work underneath the car when someone is within earshot.  Many people have died from otherwise survivable injuries because they were completely alone.  If you can't avoid this, as I often can't, here are a few suggestions:   Don't put your entire body under the car if you don't have to. If you can leave your torso out from under the car and get it with one hand, do that. Prioritize your body parts. I know it sounds morbid to think about, but I would much rather lose a hand or arm if something failed than have the car land on my chest. Don't assume it can't happen either, that's how people get hurt. Make sure your clothing is not caught in anything and the area is free of obstructions. It's better to take longer completing a task where you have the ability to roll out of the way than it is piling up tools all around you to get the job done more quickly and not being able to move. Have a cell phone with you, take it out of your pocket, and leave it on the ground within an easy arm's reach of wherever you are working. If you get pinned exactly where you are, you won't be able to fish it out of your pocket or get it off the table 10 feet away. This could save your life."

It's R12, but doesn't seem to have any noticeable leaks. After 15 years running and 8 years sitting, there's still pressure in the system and it still blows slightly cold. Just a bit colder than lukewarm. I plan on converting it to R134a and hoping for the best.    Once it's mechanically sound, I'll either be doing a mild restoration and just make it nice and clean, or a mild lowrider with some nice wire wheels and either airbags or a basic hydraulic system.

I'd suggest looking on craigslist, eBay, or Kijiji (Canada) and having a friend who lives in that area inspect the car for you in person.  Another thing you could try would be paying a mechanic to check out the car for you, that way you'll know everything that's not right with the car. In Alberta this pre-purchase inspection costs between $70-$100 (CAD)."

projectcar,37cl87,RiggityRekt,1 point,Tue May 26 18:58:48 2015 UTC,I would suggest a third generation Oldsmobile cutlass. You can find a solid base for a project fairly cheap compared to other more desirable muscle cars while still being on a GM A platform.

The Norwegians and other cold folk are sucking them up like crazy.   I think your best deal is to buy a Dynacorn body. You can get a brand new 1967 fastback and not have rust issues to deal with. Every Mustang in that vintage will have rust, unless it's been totally restored.   Save your coin and you can buy a very nice new body as a starter.   Barring that, look at some of the less expensive Ford/Lincoln/Mercury variants from that period like Mercury Cougar (built on almost the same chassis as Mustang and uses a lot of the same parts), Mercury Comet, Ford Falcon, Ford Fairlane, etc. You can buy one somewhat reasonably and work toward restoring it.  The big hitch is money. If you can't afford to buy a good car and keep it running, you can't afford to freight American parts over and piece one together. So, you might have to wait until you get more money together."

projectcar,377x98,tongboy,5,Tue May 26 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Very slick setup.   I have so many questions. I frequent the locost forums and scratch built one myself - my next setup will likely be a mid rear setup like yours. I dig the cobalt donor - the 1.4 l turbo has a lot going for it and the other motors aren't bad choices.  What's it weight as it sits? What sort of suspension geometry are you employing on the front? I imagine the back with the mac strut isn't great - probably a ton of camber in bump and the toe probably does some less than ideal things as well?  What sort of stiffness are you getting out of the chassis? Where about is it's center of gravity?  Will you build one with a rollbar that will pass tech  at a track? (the only thing I see it missing is a cross bar across the back...) What about a full roll cage (take it from a guy that went upside down in some blackberries - full cage or GTFO)  any intent to put some aero on it? is the rear engine sitting high enough to run a modest size diffuser? flat bottom in the front? steel or aluminum bellypan?  Edit: read the website - answered a few of my questions... What sort of flow gets to that radiator mounted where it is? any heat problems with that setup? What does weight get down to when you run racing seats and a racing battery? What about when you get rid of the factory rear parts and subframe and go tubular parts?  double edit: damnit, I was thinking of the cruze with the 1.4, not the cobalt. nobody has anything bad to say about a ecotec donor though, now a cobalt ss donor... then all you need is a proper sequential box and you'd be good to go.  triple edit: what's the smallest wheels you can fit on it? (diameter, not width, obv) Is there a cobalt donor that will take a 13"" wheel?"
projectcar,377x98,aholderith,1 point,Tue May 26 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"I answered elsewhere but to make it easier for future viewers, here is my response:   Sorry about missing your questions.  First, I'm pretty sure I've seen your excursion in the blackberries on LocustUSA. White car sliding sideways off the left side of the hill climb course? Glad you got out of that one okay.  As you can see in the recent photos, we have added a full cage to this car. It is 1.5 inch x .095 wall DOM. The Goblin is still available without the cage. It still comes with the main hoop, diagonal and shoulder bars.  The front suspension is SLA with 3 inches of bump and 2.5 of droop. Camber gain is 2.5 degrees over the 3 inches of bump. KPI is 10 degrees and caster is 8 degrees. We arrived at these numbers from what we read online. There is going to be a lot of learning at the track, but we can make any pieces we want and try everything we can think of.  The rear suspension with MacPherson strut is low cost and easy to build but isn't perfect. It doesn't gain as much camber as the front but by changing the height of the tie rod location, we have been able to eliminate bump steer. I've read about Porsche running some bump steer in the rear so we've left the tie rod mount adjustable to try out their idea.  We haven't looked into any major aero components yet. The aluminum floor pan extends from the front bulkhead (just in front of the pedals) to behind the seats. Right now we plan on the hot radiator air going under the car like Ariel Atom, but we could try covering the floor all the way to the nose and allow the radiator exhaust to exit around the front control arms.  We could extend the floor back under the subframe. There is a slight upward angle to the rear of the subframe which could allow a simple diffuser.  The weight of the first car was 1480 pounds. We haven't finished this car enough to weigh it. The seats are Corbeaus that weigh 19 pounds a piece instead of the stock Cobalt 40 pounds each. Not sure how much a racing battery will save. With a little saved on aluminum calipers, wheels and shocks, we hope to be under 1400 even with the full cage. We will eventually look into replacing the subframe with a tube version, probably at the same time that we do a more track oriented rear suspension.  The Cobalt rotors are 10.5 inches so when you add on the caliper, I'm not sure a 13 inch wheel can fit. The stock Cobalt wheels are 15s."
projectcar,377x98,aholderith,3,Sat Jul 18 14:07:00 2015 UTC,"Not a criticism, just curious: Why did you choose do go with macpherson struts on the back opposed to double wishbone like on the front?"
projectcar,377x98,gemini86,3,Tue May 26 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"It's purely a cost and time saving decision. Running the stock suspension from the front of the Cobalt is nearly free and very easy to manufacture and install.   We are working on a custom wishbone or multi link setup but it will cost more when you add up coilovers, ball joints, rod ends and control arm material. However, it will be more adjustable and will allow tire sizes over 245 45 16. So if someone wants to go all out, there could be the option of removing the struts."
projectcar,377x98,Brute1100,3,Tue May 26 02:10:48 2015 UTC,Thank you for the informative response. Why did you go with uneven arms on the front?
projectcar,377x98,perfecttttt,3,Tue May 26 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"Generally that's for even tire wear, when you have even arms, the tire must slide sideways on the surface of the road, like a constantly changing track width. Uneven arms keep the contact patch in one place on the ground, reducing the scrubbing on the tire."

It goes on pretty well, and is pretty durable.  It also goes a very long way.  It also sets up fairly quick, so only buy the 1qt can and pour it into a different container.  The one thing though is that it doesn't like to stick to clean metal.  If OP can get it down to where all the loose stuff is off, he can straight brush it on (it self levels extremely well.)  If it has bare, unrusted metal, than he is going to want to use metal prep.  For the metal prep, you are going to want to keep it continuously wet for 10 - 15 mins.  It says 15 mins on the bottle, but I haven't been doing that exactly and things have come out fine.  You end up with a whitish residue on the surface.

Looks like you built a fully modified and running vehicle that you'll just need to perform regular maintenance one.   And I hate to continue the negativity, but I don't think this vehicle looks very good. The rear is a bit attractive, but the rest looks odd. And usually I'm a bit fan of GM V8 swaps... and I'd probably love it in a regular RX7, but with the swap and this kit it just completely loses any identity as an RX7.   Edit: I see your comment about having the engine and trans swapped, so I guess that qualifies as a project car."

projectcar,36v71w,sundowntg,8,Fri May 22 16:42:46 2015 UTC,I've had 2 WRXs and a STi. All three cars were dead nuts reliable and a lot of fun. As long as a compression and leakdown test show that the motor is in good shape then I would worry about the transmission. Those things were made of glass and will often break. A popular modification was to swap in a STi transmission for the extra gear and of course the strength. I've been out of the subaru scene for a few years so take what I say with a grain of salt.  Overall you'll definitely end up spending more money in maintenance and repairs on the WRX vs the Camry because that Camry was built for your grand kids to drive around.

You probably won't be able to rebuild it yourself without specialized tools, but you could get a new 2.0 or 2.5 shortblock for ~$1800 and get the heads rebuilt/machined and put it together with a new timing kit and do that yourself.

Just as a note to anyone who might be wondering - metal work is obviously the best repair method, but you can actually safely use a lot of filler on a panel that's pretty badly mangled if you need to, even on small rust holes like this, IF you use the right material in the right order and at the correct thickness.   Do your hammer and dolly work first to bring the panel back into shape as much as possible, then grind the surface with 80 grit or rougher. Best option is something like a 50 grit roloc disc on an angle die grinder.   Do your rough-in work with Duraglas, Everglass, or another short strand fiberglass-reinforced filler. That material can safely be used up to 1/4"" sanded thickness. This stuff gives you your panel-gripping strength that won't crack. It's especially good to use over weld seams and such, even where the factory used lead way back in the day. It's very strong. I mentioned rust holes - yep, those too. Duraglas can be used on small holes if necessary. Not ideal, but if you're going to do it, this is the only material it's ok to do it with.   Once that's block sanded level or close to it with 80 grit, Do your poly filler work with a quality filler (for the love of dog, stay far away from Bondo. Use a real, quality body filler from a reputable name - USC or Evercoat.) Polyester fillers can be applied up to 1/8"" sanded thickness.   Technically-speaking, and following this method, you can safely have up to 3/8"" of filler on a panel. That's a metric shit-ton of filler to have on any surface, but those numbers are max thickness of each type of material. However, you cannot have 3/8"" of just poly filler. You should always look to do your metal work first, and make it your goal to use as little filler as possible, but if you stick to those guidelines or less, you'll actually have a solid, industry-standard repair."

projectcar,36o7ue,INdianaRolly,2,Thu May 21 04:49:53 2015 UTC,"Nope, not different cars. The AMC AMX from 68-70 was a completely different car. It was one of only two two-seater cars available in America at the time, the Corvette being the other. From 71-74 the AMX was a performance package for the Javelin. It had things like extra spoilers, a fiberglass cowl induction hood some suspension goodies and a few other things. To be honest and I'm not completely sure but OP's doesn't look like an AMX. At least that is not the hood or grille that came on a 73 AMX."

Black was sinister and got tons of people asking about the car.    I'd go flat or satin black indeed.  Go gloss black and then dip it in flat black to protect the paint.  Black is only perfect for a year IMO, then the defects from washing and such start showing up.  Dip will protect it from hater keys and door dings too.  Be careful when parking and passing, no visibility to the rear and that hood is massively long.  Aircraft carrier, as Shinoda so famously said.  Edit:  No stripes.  Think Vin Diesel's black Challenger in the fast and furious movies.  Would you put a stripe kit on that car?  Hell no."

projectcar,36nh9d,lvsanche,1 point,Wed May 20 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, steering wheel is a MOMO Mod. 08, leather wrapped.  The car came with a Weber 34 dgec and I removed the electric choke because it wouldn't open fully."
projectcar,36nh9d,lvsanche,1 point,Wed May 20 21:20:54 2015 UTC,How much did the whole steering set up cost man? I'm thinking of going with a single side draft once it get it back running. Do you have any other engine mods ?
projectcar,36nh9d,lvsanche,1 point,Thu May 21 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"The steering wheel was $229 and I think I spent ~$100 on the hub and hub spacer.  I had to buy some 3"" and 1.5"" PVC pipe to finish everything off but that didn't cost more than $10.  So total ~$340.  As far as engine mods, all of the emission stuff has been deleted (charcoal canister, air pump, other misc vacuum lines etc...) and it has a Weber 34 carb as I mentioned.  On the exhaust side I plugged the egr holes in the head with studs from BRD racing ($12.99) and I have a 4 into 1 long tube header that I got from ebay for ~$100.  I also deleted the stock mechanical fuel pump and replaced it with an electric one from Carter."
projectcar,36nh9d,TheHast,1 point,Thu May 21 00:19:23 2015 UTC,"Those all sounds like solid upgrades. I was thinking of getting a better cam, maybe bigger valves. The problem I'm facing is having to deal with CA smog regulations every 2 years. How permanent are the deleted canister, air pump, and egr hole cover ups? I might need to slap them on every time I want to pass the smog test. I don't know much but did you have to change your fuel tank for the fuel pump?"
projectcar,36nh9d,lvsanche,2,Thu May 21 02:12:35 2015 UTC,I have that wheel on my miata and it's very good.  Don't skimp out on the expensive momo wheel adapter if you value your life.
projectcar,36nh9d,lvsanche,1 point,Thu May 21 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"Haha, I agree.  While I didn't get the momo adapter I did get another reputable adapter by NRG that is solid aluminum and engages the steering column spline fully.  I wouldn't feel comfortable using one of those knockoff boss adapters on ebay for $20."
projectcar,36nh9d,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Thu May 21 03:43:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it would be a lot of work.  To get to the egr ports you need to remove the exhaust manifold. The charcoal canister and air pump all involve a maze of vacuum lines.  I won't say it can't be done/undone every 2 years but it will take some dedication.  The electric fuel pump I used is external to the fuel tank and mounted up under the tank near the spare tire well."
projectcar,36nh9d,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Thu May 21 03:30:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured as much. I took out my carb and intake manifold a few weeks ago along with the head and saw how much of a mess all the vacuum lines are. The thing is that since I enjoy messing around with the car and all that I wouldn't mind taking things apart every two years. My only concern is with some modifications that might not be reversible. How hard of a set up is the pump?
projectcar,36nh9d,Corrupt_Reverend,1 point,Thu May 21 03:59:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the electric fuel pump is too hard.  First, you need to run power to the rear of the car.  When I was doing all of the work on my car and I had the dashboard out I spliced into a switched wire with a 30A fuse and it has never given me a problem.  Turn the key, fuel pump goes on.  Next is the pump, go here for that info: http://www.racetep.com/webfuelspark.html  I have the Carter 4070 in my car currently and one of the big advantages like the link says is that it doesn't need a fuel pressure regulator.  Before I installed the Carter pump I actually had the last pump listed (Lower Cost Single Carb pump).  The pump worked fine and I even ran the system with no fuel return line to the tank.  However I'm sure the car was running rich as a result but the 3tc didn't mind.  With the new Carter pump I plumbed a proper return line (hard line) to the fuel tank. I imagine you could get away without a return line but if the pump runs constantly then you are going to flood your carb and maybe even hydrolock your engine.  One solution to this problem is to put the fuel pump on a manual switch.  I chose not to do this because I wanted to make the car operate like a more modern car.  Honestly, the hardest part of the whole process was just getting under the car on my garage floor.  Trying to run a new hard fuel line with only about a foot of space is not fun.  If you have some high lift jack stands or a lift then your job will be much easier than mine.  Even easier would be to just run flexible fuel lines from the new pump to the carb and back to the tank.  The only downside to an external fuel pump is that it will make a droning/buzzing noise.  For me the noise is inconsequential because the exhaust note covers it and the lack of sound deadening in my car also makes for a noisy ride."
projectcar,36nh9d,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Thu May 21 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hear that people set up the pump and use the existing hard lines to return fuel. Maybe I'll do something similar. As to space, I can get my car pretty high up which will help I'm sure.   I think I'll upgrade my pump once I get the new carbs, I'm sure the side drafts will need it.  How good is that $100 exhaust ?"
projectcar,36nh9d,Corrupt_Reverend,1 point,Thu May 21 07:13:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I used my existing hard lines for delivery and return.  And you're right, if you're upgrading your carb your mechanical fuel pump is not going to be adequate.  As for the exhaust, it's a knock-off of the one listed on this page: http://www.brdracing.com/2tc_3tc_exhaust.htm.  I don't have any numbers for you but the exhaust is noticeably wider than stock, provides a good exhaust note and has held up for a number of years.  One word of caution, you will need to weld you own O2 bung into the exhaust for an oxygen sensor."

projectcar,36nh9d,yourenotmydad,3,Wed May 20 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"I'd check the local vehicle code before Friday.  If you were in CA, your car wouldn't meet code.  Here you're only allowed two auxiliary driving lamps, not an entire aisle of them."
projectcar,36nh9d,yourenotmydad,3,Wed May 20 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"If they're at least 16"" from the ground, he could slap a piece of tape over them and say they're for off-road use only. (you're allowed 8 off-road lights)  Also, I've never had to have a vehicle inspection in CA and I've owned quite a few cars over the years. (Everything from normal bill-of-sale, to lean sales and non-ops.)  Edit: And you could probably argue that the light bar is really a single light since the separate LEDs are focused as a single cohesive beam. Not sure if it'd be successful, but it sounds good. It'd really just depend on the judge (assuming this is after a citation)."
projectcar,36nh9d,berberlevin,1 point,Wed May 20 23:10:59 2015 UTC,"focused as a single cohesive beam   If there was a single lens in front of the LEDs, maybe.  But there's no lenses at all, just diffusers."
projectcar,36nh9d,berberlevin,2,Wed May 20 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"True. And they each have a reflector. Oh well. ""off-road"" thing would work if they're high enough though.  Honestly though, it all depends on where you live. LED bars are common on lifted trucks in my area. Nobody bats an eye at them as long as they're not turned on at night.  The one thing they will get ya for around here is headlights that are too high after getting a truck lifted.  CHPs the next town over camp the local offroad shop to give tickets to people leaving the shop after having a lift installed.  I just wish they'd start doing the headlight alignment check-points again. I swear most people don't even know they're supposed to aim their headlights, let alone how to do it. :/"

Black spraypaint can improve the sharpness of the black areas by tenfold as well, tape off the outside sections with newspaper and some painters tape and spray away. Don't underestimate a sharpie either.  Get some help from whoever owns that car on the right with the cleaning.  Good luck dude!"

projectcar,36loj6,anfeline,5,Wed May 20 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"A little info:    '92 Chevy Astro CL shorty. 150hp 4.3L and 4L60. She has 120k on the clock and sat untouched (except for the kitties running all over it) in a carport for 8 years.    The owner passed away, and the husband stopped driving it shortly after and drove is 00-something Pontiac Grand Am GT. The husband recently passed away, and the son doesn't live here anymore, so he needed it gone.    Long story short, I got it for $150. Clean title, but naturally the paperwork has been expired as long as it's been sitting. That means the registration may or may not have fallen out of the system. The former is what I'm hoping for, but the latter will be expensive. I'll deal with that once I get there.    For now, I'm just cleaning her up and getting her running. Underneath all that dust, it looked like she'd clean up well. There's no rust or dents, but there's the typical 90s GM peeling paint. After vacuuming out all the gecko turds (MUCH better than rat turds, but still gross nonetheless), I started on the engine. I got impatient, so the first thing I did was see if it would run on carb cleaner. So there I am, sitting in the passenger seat, a can of carb cleaner one hand, and my phone in the other (to capture any horrific events that may occur, of course). I crank the engine and spray, and surprisingly, she coughs and runs a bit. That's a very good sign.    I did all the fluids, but I'm waiting on a replacement fuel tank and some other parts. In the meantime, I'll be doing vacuum hoses, cleaning, and detailing.    That's it for now, but if anyone's interested, I'll continue to document this build."

projectcar,36nskb,Oricy,2,Wed May 20 19:00:42 2015 UTC,It's hard to tell if the sizes are going to be okay without additional information. Are you running offset trailing arms? Dropped ride height? Flares? I don't think those will tuck under the original body as the stock size was 6.95. You're also going to want to calculate what the Backspacing should be to get your clearances right.

projectcar,36kfvs,abritinthebay,2,Wed May 20 04:40:53 2015 UTC,So lets say you had a hole in the middle somewhere. You can grind it down and fill it in more or less with bondo and repaint etc etc.   Here you kinda have to have bondo kinda hanging in the air and it's in a precarious place where rocks and water will just break it off. So doing it right will be quite challenging I think.   You could buy some fender flares which are just plastic pieces that could potentially just cover up the rust. It won't fix the problem but you wont be able to see it.   Or go the full way and find a new replacement.

projectcar,36fvep,ewitwins,4,Tue May 19 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"This was the first affordable Japanese sports car to reach a wide market. There were Japanese sports cars before them, the Toyota 2000GT, the Mazda Cosmo, the Datsun Fairlady Sports 1600/2000 Roadsters but the Datsun 240Z was the first one that was really widely popular. It was cheap, had 150+hp, was light, looked great, and drove well. It sold very well. It also raced and won, there are S30Z's still winning their classes every weekend.  This is a Japanese car that is truly iconic, has classic looks, and is a benchmark for JDM cars. A lot of people grew up admiring Japanese cars because that is what their parents drove and those people are now able to afford collector and project cars and Japanese cars are now finally becoming desirable because of it. I grew up with Japanese cars, my grandmother had an '81 Prelude, my other grandmother had an '82 Accord, my uncle had a 280ZX, aunt had a Toyota Corolla, uncle had a Toyota Supra, dad drove a Datsun B210 and a Datsun 720. Because of this I never really had any interest in American cars and I believe there are millions out there that share my interest in Japan-steel and distaste for USDM rides.  Another appeal is that you can acquire one of these Z's for relatively cheap, they are pretty easy to repair if you don't have a rust nightmare, parts are easy to find for like 90% of the car (some things you can't get any longer like an original dashboard), and the parts are pretty cheap for a classic car. You can swap in a ton of different engines and because of the light chassis and independent suspension it can be made pretty god damn fast and still be able to handle pretty well if you update some of the suspension components.

projectcar,36agh2,WarCleric,3,Sun May 17 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge IR fan when it comes to compressors. Most 110 and 220v that are marketed at the average guy are all made in China. In my opinion,  I would get a Husky  or Kobalt 220v from Lowes or Home Depot. Chances are they are coming from the same factories with different paint and decals.  I just bought a 110v Quincy portable with a vertical tank. It's made in the USA. And it puts out the most CFM for any 110v. The compressor pump is rated for 10,000 hours of use. The motor is convertable to 220v. It's actually the exact same as the Chicago Pneumatic and Bel Aire with different  paint.   I looked at it this way if I was going to spend that much on a compressor. I wanted it to last my lifetime.

projectcar,36agh2,cyrax6,2,Sun May 17 21:32:43 2015 UTC,No not really. They have come a long way without a doubt. But given the choice I'm going to buy an American made product over one that isn't. Expecially when you start comparing and the imported product doesn't push as many CFM. Which means longer cycle times which will cost more on electricity and compressor wear. For a little more money you get a compressor that will push more air and keep Americans  employed.
projectcar,36agh2,a_deadly_fart,1 point,Sun May 17 21:51:12 2015 UTC,Second the husky/kobalt idea. 10 years ago I bought a 30 gallon husky compression and it's still going strong. They make larger models suitable for painting and I think for a beginner or hobbyist this is the way to get started.   IR would be suitable of course too! Good luck.
projectcar,36agh2,backvest,4,Sun May 17 22:08:56 2015 UTC,Ingersoll rand makes great compressors.  I think that would be plenty to paint with and run just about any air tool
projectcar,36agh2,slvrmark4,5,Sun May 17 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  That said... believe it or not, IR actually makes this compressor (or a very similar compressor) for several companies under their own 'brand'.  I have an 80 gallon 5HP compressor from Home Depot, which is actually a re-branded IR compressor.  It even has both logos in the manual.    That looks like a great buy.   If I can make a suggestion, make an air cooler.  It will cool the air coming out of the compressor tank and help keep it out of your tools and paint gun.  Mine is 3/4"" copper pipe.  Basically its a series of 180 degree switchbacks with a drain at the bottom of each run.  It then runs up to a separator and regulator."

I just looked at the model the OP linked a bit closer and it's actually the SS4L5 which IR doesn't even show on their site. My dad and I both have the SS5L5 which is still listed. It makes me think that they have licensed their name out to be put on that compressor to a generic Chinese company. The pump is completely different from the SS5L5 (it's much smaller and higher RPM; which explains the lower CFM output and other issues).

Since at first glance it looks like the engine is all there, I imagine there's a decent chance you can bring it back to life, provided it's been inside that barn the whole time.

Also since you want to swap in a 5 speed you will need to get new pedals, hydraulic lines, center console trim pieces, and many other parts.  Buy a car that already has a manual transmission."

projectcar,36bcps,mike_falcone,7,Mon May 18 00:15:44 2015 UTC,"Start with a compression test. Check for water in oil.   It could just be a bad hose which you shouldnt have to pull the motor.   Have or do a pressure test in the cooling system. That will tell you where its leaking. Hell the radiator might just be clogged....that was my problem after my LTD sat for ten years. Simpliest way to find that out is to start it up and let it get warm, shut it down then run your hand over the radiator looking for cool spots.  As for it continuing to run after you pulled the key, squirt some wd40 or graphite lube in there. Failing that a new key switch isnt that bad.   Dude its a 70s caddy...you can fix it in the backyard with pliers.   Edit...just re read it. That brown shit is a huge indicator of a clogged cooling system.   Do the compression test and make sure the Head gaskets are fine. Then flush the cooling system. Id also replace the thermostat and rad cap. Then check if the rad is clogged. If so, grab another. They arent too terribly expensive."

projectcar,36bcps,PeteFord,1 point,Mon May 18 11:51:59 2015 UTC,"The brown water is likely from the coolant that wasn't flushed from the engine. There's a lot more than you'd think in there.    Since you replaced everything in the cooling system, it's possible that you didn't bleed the system. I made the same mistake and it was spitting coolant everywhere. I bled it properly and all was well.    I'd say do some reading and go over your cooling system yourself."

If all else fails and you need to rebuild it, the price won't be nearly as bad as you think. Likely a hone, new bearings and gaskets, maybe even a quick valve job would sort it all out. You can rebuild an old motor with a cheap socket set and rented torque wrench. Just go slow and be patient. I did my old 350, with pistons/rods/cam/used aftermarket heads and intake for about 1300$. A hone and gasket/bearing job is much much cheaper (I bet it would be less than 400$).    Good luck :)"

Easiest/cheapest way to do it is to add a lowering block and/or lowering shackles but you can get wheel hop depending on how much you lower them with the blocks.  I wouldn't do more than a couple inches with the blocks because of that.  Not sure what ute you have but if your axle is under the leafs, you can flip the axle and put the axle over the leafs.  Then add in blocks and you can get dropped around 6 inches no problem.  You can also get new spindles, control arms, and hangars, or switch to airbags."

He doesn't need to justify anything. Nowhere in the original comment did he state that he was strictly keeping it rotary or state how he feels about engine swaps. The only thing that makes a rotary rebuilt to OEM spec ""better"" for his goals is the novelty factor and maybe resale value, although LS swapped RX-7's usually command a premium over ones with stock rebuild rotaries... The engine is out of the car right now and he's starting from a worn stock rotary - it's the best time to consider the pros/cons of his options. The only pro right now, aside from cost, is that he's keeping the car more or less OEM and apparently this makes him happy - which I wasn't aware of until I asked."

projectcar,35zdpk,ZexGX,4,Fri May 15 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Budget times called for budget tires. According to my instructor at the track day and other people who have ridden along, I'm extracting all I can from these tires.   I've always heard its best not to start with sticky tires because they act as a crutch."
projectcar,35zdpk,spikederailed,3,Fri May 15 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, if you know your car well enough from driving it hard often then the tires arent a crutch, swapping tires around also gives you better perspective on how much of the performance is based on the suspension and vehicle itself and what tires, types etc will affect you."
projectcar,35zdpk,MightyPenguin,2,Fri May 15 08:17:47 2015 UTC,"On my 99 Firebird land yacht (coilovers, aggressive alignment, etc.) I went from 245/50/16s on Kumho all seasons, to Riken Raptors, to 275/40/17 NT555's, then NT555R rear, then NT05 on all four corners, then NT555RII (the road race version of NT555R) on all four corners. Gradually increasing the grip worked great for me to keep me safely entertained and continually increase the limits of my car and improve my driving skills. If you are still in the very early stages of learning how your car handles, race compound tires can definitely be a crutch."
projectcar,35zdpk,spikederailed,1 point,Fri May 15 08:31:23 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I do want to get new tires to replace these shot ones, but I'm not sure what I want.   I'm also stuck with if I want different wheels or not. The FD wheels I'm running are great at 16x8 and extremely lightweight. They are +50 offset however and require a 1 inch spacer for clearance.   The spacers have held up fine through all the abuse , but if I could get rid of them I would. I'm looking at 17x9 rpf1s with +22 offset. Square setup would let me rotate and eek a bit more life out of them I would imagine."
projectcar,35zdpk,breakbread,2,Fri May 15 08:38:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm...Go with tires for now and do wheels later, your already on a budget and going to be spending money getting the car running again, and going to need tires. Just get nice tires for it and save for new wheels and tires next time around...beware with the real sticky fun tires that their life is way shorter.."
projectcar,35zdpk,zinklesmesh,2,Fri May 15 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. When you are ready for even more grip, and have more money, the 17x9 RPF1's with a similar (or better) tire than what you are running on the 16x8's will be a huge difference (I drove for a few years on 16x8.5 and switched to 17x9 with a similar compound and sidewall stretch amount... bigger contact patch is fun)."

projectcar,360d5k,ookiisask,2,Fri May 15 03:32:33 2015 UTC,"Now, I could be wrong, but from my experiences, if you have Cheap, Reliable, and Turbo, you typically only get to choose two.  This goes doubly so for JDM/Euro cars.  You might be able to find a reliable turbo for a cheap upfront cost, but JDM/Euro parts tend to be much more expensive than domestics.   Now, it's at this point I'll mention that the vast majority of my experience is in domestic V8 stuff, so I'm likely heavily biased. Most of my information comes from my local friends who run in the tuner crowd and cost conversations therein."
projectcar,360d5k,Nicapizza,2,Fri May 15 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in JDM, there is the 280zx turbo which was an 80s car. There's also the 240sx and the 300zx."

My Monte had sat for ~10 years before I rescued it from its' previous owners, and the only major rust was the driver's side footwell.   Since it hardly ever freezes out here, there's almost zero salt on the roads during the winter, so frame/body corrosion isn't a major problem.

My dad thought it would be a decent car that I couldn't get into too much trouble with. Well, that changed a little once he got into the boost on the drive home from the dealer. The old  2.3L turbo (190hp) was surprisingly peppy with the 5-speed. Anyway, after a few months I managed to blow the turbo oil seals, which we fixed, but the final nail was a blown head gasket. My options were to stick with the 4-cyl or go big with a V8 swap. At 17 yrs old with little understanding of the capabilities of forced induction I opted for the swap. Between classes and work I didn't have much time or money so it took around 5 years to get it back on the road. And within a few months of that we hit a deer. After that it just moved from garage to garage with me. A year and a half ago, out of nowhere, I decided to replace the parking brake cables (which had never worked) and the project just snowballed. I kept saying “while I'm in here might as well do XYZ.” So from parking brake to replacing/rebuilding the entire brake system to freshening up the motor.     Below are some of the specs:      Full Granatelli Motorsports tubular k-member and A-arms Granatelli coil over strut conversion Koni struts/shocks Auto parts store remanufactured 351W long block(1979 casting) low compression heads 89 Mustang GT T5 Weiand dual plane intake Holley vacuum secondary 750cfm carb Ford Racing cam (m-6250-a332) March Performance serpentine pulley system MSD 6AL ignition system BBK swap headers BBK catted x-pipe Flex-a-lite dual electric low profile fans & adjustable controller Custom stainless steel brake lines Hydroboost conversion with Mustang SVO master cylinder (done by previous owner) Mustang 3 row radiator Energy Suspension bushings all the way around Battery relocated to trunk Cable clutch conversion and adjustable quadrant New 2.5 turn rack and pinion (got it cheap on closeout from rockauto) 17x9 Cobra R replica wheels SN-95 4.6 GT Coupe rear coil springs Caster/Camber plates A bunch of other stuff I've forgotten about..."

We purchased in it Central Oregon, and worked for the previous owners for about 100 hours. They lived on a ranch and the work was hard, but somewhat enjoyable. At least that's how I remember it!   We dragged the car down to California in August and had it driving by March of the next year. We completely rebuilt the brake system, rebuilt the transmission, and surprisingly didn't have to do much to the engine other than flipping the distributor 180 degrees and rebuilding the carb. Suspension has been worked on, new springs up front, Arning drop, new UCAs, new LCA, and all four shocks.   Recently fixed a vacuum leak on the carb so I had to retune it.

More angular and 80s, as opposed to the 60s/70s look of the S30.  The S30 is the better looking car."

I prefer the S30's chapman strut rear suspension over the semi-trailing arm rear suspension of the 280zx.  It is much easier with suspension upgrades to make an S30Z handle well than it is an S130.

projectcar,35fq7f,goeslikestank,1 point,Sun May 10 00:23:23 2015 UTC,This is the sort of thing I would try to do. I'm very familiar with hptuners and the features they offer around this.  I'd throw the DoD out and spend all my time getting lean burn working perfectly for light load cruising. you'll get approximately the same fuel efficiency improvements as DoD but with a known quantity of configuration and tuning. And in box support for manual gear boxes  Actually seeing the DoD through would be tough. You'd need to mimic the sensor data the auto collects then feed it to the ecu on the gm specific communication protocol it expects. In order to get that you'd need to collect data from a running setup and reverse engineer the details.  And then you want a better cam and all that work goes out the window.  Lean burn ftw

The install was really straightforward, the instructions were thorough and they provided everything required except for cutting utensils and a socket set.  I can't say for certain if its increased power or not (probably), but it most certainly has made the intake loud.  It resonates really badly in the cabin now when the engines under a lot of load, like going up a steep hill.

Minimum wage + old german car + mods = $$$$ that you dont have.   Go ahead and downvote me because you dont agree but someone making roughly $1000 a month is screwing themselves trying to maintain a car like that. A major repair that he cant do himself will cost his entire months pay. And he shouldnt kid himself in thinking a 300k mile car wont need a major repair."

A used 2007 m5 depreciates 75% over 8 years and can be bought for 28k right now I'd you're willing to rebuild the vanos in it. Doesn't speak volumes for a car that once cost over 100000 dollars."
projectcar,35asc0,chiller119,5,Fri May 8 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I was stressed that my wifes Acura was going to have issues at 200,000 miles, then I stressed it was going to have issues at 300,000 miles. I have had zero issues other than brakes, fluids, timing belts, water pump, thermostat (water pump and thermostat done each timing belt change). We are now well into the 400,000 mile range and frankly we are ready for a new car so we are ok with it dying on us."
projectcar,35asc0,maaseyracer,4,Fri May 8 19:41:26 2015 UTC,Same here. 198000 on my Tl which I autocross every year. 240000 on our lexus sc400. Still no issues.
projectcar,35asc0,chiller119,2,Fri May 8 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"If you really wanted to be taking shots at the E60 M5 you should mention how the main bearings like to eat themselves around 50k miles and take the motor out.   But still, most exotic and luxury cars tend to be maintenance monsters. Its just the nature of the beast."
projectcar,35asc0,DOHCMerc,0,Fri May 8 21:31:34 2015 UTC,Unless it's a lexus or acura. The nsx is proof that you can own a super car without it bankrupting you. Hell even the boosted lexus's keep running with no issues. You're right about exotics but IMHO a well engineered car is one that doesn't try to kill itself. 90's lexus man. The 1uz and any iterations after. Just exceptional tech. I wouldn't mind a nice late 80's amg cause they were built right then. Something like the hammer. Brilliant vehicle!  Or maybe one day buy a Merc and if it gives issues swap the motor and gut the car and throw in an LS. Have a gorgeous shell to screw around in.
projectcar,35asc0,chiller119,2,Fri May 8 23:12:56 2015 UTC,"Its not a German brand reliability question. Audis reliability is improving, everyones favorite punching bag, and Porsche reliability has always been quite high, the same with Buick and Ford. However you want to measure it, now the top 10 reliable brands ratings are so close together that its almost negligible. As a counter point, I recall Hondas reliability in the 2000s were quite dismal with a lot of transmission failures in the automatic Accords and TLs.  Its not about brands, its about not having the funding to own a car that is expensive to own."
projectcar,35asc0,teh__sukc,0,Fri May 8 19:57:55 2015 UTC,Actually it is about the brands. Fact is that certain brands build cars to be replaced like Mercedes audi and bmw. Just look at the carbon buildup issues those cars have. Porsches are pretty awesome especially the cayman. Audi's electrical issues isn't excusable. When you buy a car at the 50k  price point it's not asking for a lot to have it be reliable.   Yes the tl and accord were bad however they were 2 cars in 2 seperate line ups. There is something to be said when the resale of your car plummets over the years and the cars are sold the minute the warranty is up. The fact is German cars now specifically the brands I listed are not designed to last but to be replaced.
projectcar,35asc0,chiller119,3,Fri May 8 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"German cars depreciate hard because the people who lease them want to have the newest thing every two or three years, and the second hand cars end up in the ghetto rocking bent 24's on chinese tires while every warning light on the gauge cluster is illuminated becuase it wasn't maintained. (See E65/E66 7 series)  At some point in time a mass produced luxury car does become just a car, I can get a 30 year old Rolls Royce or Bentley for next to nothing. I don't see old acuras, infinitis or even anything from the old lexus lineup selling for high dollar amounts.   Cars depreciate, its the circle of automotive life."
projectcar,35asc0,DOHCMerc,-2,Fri May 8 21:22:58 2015 UTC,Depreciation is different from losing 70 percent of its value. Hell look at the type s acuras today. They still go for over 20k. Cars like the m5 on the other hand. Tell me how anyone can justify a loss of 80% of its value in 8 years?

projectcar,35asc0,teh__sukc,-1,Sat May 9 01:20:52 2015 UTC,From what I've seen the tl and accord had the bulk of the issues. There were isolated issues with the other cars in the line up. For the most part the tl and accord were the worst.  Unless you got the 6 speed
projectcar,35asc0,chiller119,1 point,Sat May 9 13:35:13 2015 UTC,"It bugs me when people talk about resale value or depreciation like it ties back to a qualitative value of some sort.  The sheer demand for a car and the willingness of people to pay is what determines the cars used value which determines its depreciation. Why there is a demand or lack of demand for a car is different for every car. A car with low/high depreciation has no correlation with quality, reliability, anything except public demand and willingness to pay a certain price."
projectcar,35asc0,teh__sukc,-1,Fri May 8 23:10:01 2015 UTC,It is a mark of demand. There's a reason why a 90's nsx costs more than a 2007 m5. That's the point. Demand is a reflection of desirability and most importantly reliability.
projectcar,35asc0,chiller119,1 point,Fri May 8 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"Demand is a reflection of desirablility and most importantly reliability   You are half right: demand is a reflection of desirability, which is exactly what I stated. Demand is absolutely not a reflection of reliability. The drive behind the demand varies from person to person. A $10M Ferrari GTO from the 60s isnt worth $10M because its reliable. It fetched $10M because that is what someone was willing to pay for it. In that case, the demand is tied to its rareness.  Again, desirability has no reflection on reliability. Desirability varies from car to car, and reasons varry person to person."
projectcar,35asc0,teh__sukc,-1,Sat May 9 00:01:04 2015 UTC,Hmm that makes sense.  I guess it depends on what segment we're talking about. I still see the most ratty hondas have some value just because people believe it'll be fine even though it's been badly maintained. But you do make a good point.

projectcar,35asc0,roosri,4,Fri May 8 16:21:05 2015 UTC,S54's aren't that cheap to me and my 18 year old minimum wage self. I'm confident I can do a low boost setup to start with for cheap. I just need to figure out A/C because I'm jumping through hoops to install it right now. Not to mention everyone loves a turbo!
projectcar,35asc0,fullnelson13,7,Fri May 8 17:03:41 2015 UTC,Yeah you're gonna be rebuilding the engine soon regardless if you think you're gonna boost.
projectcar,35asc0,emptyminded42,1 point,Fri May 8 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"Boosting an ancient high mileage motor like that ain't gonna be cheap either when it blows up. Just save up, man. Don't go cheap, you will pay for it later. I can't imagine a turbo kit not from eBay and tuning would be less than a swap."
projectcar,35asc0,TrevorsMailbox,3,Fri May 8 17:10:43 2015 UTC,The s50/m50 motors have been proven to handle a decent bit of boost with only ARP headstuds. A high millage motor with ARP studs and a thicker headgasket SHOULD be able to handle low boost.... But I guess there is only one way to find out.
projectcar,35asc0,emptyminded42,5,Fri May 8 17:23:14 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt it'll handle low boost,  but how long do you think that's going to last when the mileage is pushing 300k?  It'll be a ticking time bomb.  I second the save up and do it right.  If you're 18 making minimum wage and a swap is out of your price range I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say replacing your s50 after it kicks the bucket is out of your price range too.    I know it's exciting and you want to throw a turbo in NOW because who doesn't like a turbo and waiting is no fun, but that's a sweet ride and I doubt sitting in your driveway making ::vroom vroom:: noises in between sobs while your M's green and golden blood slowly soaks into your driveway is going to be too thrilling either.     As someone older, wiser and with ghosts of cars long past lost due to stupidity/jumping the gun haunting him at night...put your money into making a solid foundation for modifications or your car, wallet and dreams will slide into a lonely dark abyss resembling something not unlike a late 80's Dodge caravan where your happiness is peeled away like faux wood paneling leaving you with nothing but the smell of stale French fries and dirty diapers."

Truth be told, if the s50 blows I'll swap in a m50 for the time being and build the s50. M50's are like 400, even I can afford that!"

Or, spend that money on tires and suspension (not eBay coilovers though!) which will give you a lot more bang for the buck than a cheap ass turbo setup that will grenade itself."
projectcar,35asc0,TrevorsMailbox,1 point,Fri May 8 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My first real car was my Firebird, and it had a horrible V6 in it. I knew I'd be doing an engine swap someday, so I just did research into what it would take to swap an LS1 into it. Between the time I started modding it and the time it finally got an LS1, nearly all of the suspension and appearance mods I originally wanted had been completed."

I agree with others on here that boosting a high mileage engine without a full rebuild is a recipe for disaster. That being said, an engine swap is the way to go for cheap reliable HP. Get a low mileage LS1 drivetrain with hareness and ECU from a 98-02 Camaro or Firebird and put that badboy in there. There are mount kits available and you'll have to get some exhaust fab done but it'll be worth it. This option will also avoid fucking with your DME."
projectcar,35asc0,inkosana,1 point,Fri May 8 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"And aside from having cheap, easy to find parts available, the dollar-per-horsepower amount is vastly improved. The only downside is the reactions you'll get from OEM-numbnuts who think same-OEM is the only acceptable way to go for any modifications. A stock LS1 would probably put it close to or over what it would make with an eBay-type turbo kit."
projectcar,35asc0,peterjakan,2,Fri May 8 19:50:17 2015 UTC,And not fall apart.
projectcar,35asc0,peterjakan,1 point,Fri May 8 19:53:41 2015 UTC,"FWIW, cross-brand engine swaps are generally amazingly more expensive than you'd expect at first glance due to the sheer volume of parts you'll have to replace/modify since everything that has anything to do with the engine or transmission will have to change to accommodate the new drivetrain.  They also will take far longer to complete than you'd hope and/or plan for, and unless you've got the financial security to be able to just throw money at it to get around unexpected pitfalls,  the car will wind up torn apart for weeks/months/years while he waits to get money to fix/replace/upgrade/modify something that wasn't planned for initially.  So unless he's got a second car to drive around for as long as it takes to swap this car which potentially could be forever, something like that probably isn't a great idea."

projectcar,35asc0,DOHCMerc,1 point,Mon May 11 21:51:58 2015 UTC,"But a stock S54 is already at about 300whp..  I mean, I guess everything is a matter of perspective.    We put 600 WHP in a Opel from 1975, though modified in terms of handling it's still a 40 year old geomitry, and I'll admit it was pushing the limit on that grip but still.    We then put 750 WHP into a 1984 E24 and it handled it just fine, also a little modified in terms of handling but nothing extreme.    We're now in the making of a E46 330Xi that'll have around 800 WHP and it can handle it just fine aswell.    So, in my opinion, 300 WHP in a M3 chassis is nowhere near the upper limits, but as I said, I guess it's a matter of perspective."

Toughest parts of the job: Headunit: Figuring out which wires were what based on a japanese language manual for the old head unit  Camera: Getting power and video cables through the waterproof cable boot between the liftgate and the car, having to rip out a considerable amount of the upholstery/trim to get the video and reverse light wire up to the head unit."

I'm happy to explain it all though :)  The headunit took an RCA video input, but it also needs to know when the car is in reverse.  For this I ran a wire from the LH reverse lamp positive wire all the way up to the head unit and connected it to the 'reverse signal' input.  The camera itself was mounted on the lift gate just below the license plate.  It needed both the video RCA cable and positive and negative power.  I fed its cables through the panel via the rubber grommet for the liftgate window latch button.  Then routed them around the latch window (under the trim) up to the top where there is a rubber grommet/boot for feeding wires through to the cabin.    From here I ran the power wires down the LHS behind the trim to the tail light, and soldered the power wires to the reverse lamp wires (to power the camera when in reverse).    I ran the RCA video lead along with a wire I also connected to the reverse lamp positive all the way up along the LH trim, down to the floor under the kick plate, under the carpet beneath the front seat, into and along the center console and up into where the head unit is.  The whole reversing camera procedure took me 9 hrs.  Mostly from fighting with upholstery/trim and that frigging rubber grommet/boot!  The car battery also went dead just as I was re-assembling it so I then had to charge that overnight...  Hope that helps!"

Pros of AAW:   Really well respected in all muscle car and truck communities I looked at. All wires are the same color, but have evenly spaced labels down the entire length of the wire so you never confuse them. Great customer service experiences according to purchasers Better than stock wire gauges used wherever the circuit warranted it Great instructions and diagrams, on top of the customer service to answer odd questions Well laid out fuseblocks Fantastic price   Cons:    All wires are black? (I don't think this is a con because of the labels)   I looked at all the companies you listed and did 50 or so hours worth of research.

projectcar,3550el,titanshub,3,Thu May 7 03:53:22 2015 UTC,"Here's what you do. Pull your valve covers off, and wiggle each rocker arm individually. If its lifter tick, you'll feel one or more are easier to move than others. Bump the engine over a little bit and check again, do that a couple of times. If you find any that are loose or don't have much tension, try tightening it down a bit. On a hydraulic lifter engine, they should be pre loaded at all times, and the retaining bolt should be pretty damn snug, probably 40 ft/lb.  If you don't find anything weird, keep the valve covers off and drape some crappy towels around the engine bay. Start it and let it run for at least 10-15 seconds. Keep in mind this might make a bit of a mess, but you're basically checking that both heads are getting sufficient oil and everything is flowing well. Again, check each rocker. If any aren't oiling, pull that rocker, remove the pushrod and spray brake parts cleaner through the oiling hole in both directions. But a small amount of assembly lube (just a thin film) at both ends so the aren't dry when you run it again (if you've had these issues and went this far).  To me (and I work on old Fords for a living and know the fairlane/windsor/cleveland/fe/385 series very well) it sounds like you may have a burnt valve. That tick can happen when you have a cylinder running very lean, which could also cause an exhaust leak eventually from the extra heat. If you don't have a compression tester or leak down tester, grab a dollar bill and hold it up to the exhaust while the car is running. If it rapidly sucks the bill toward the exhaust you've likely got a burning valve or a valve seat issue.  If you have a vacuum gauge, connect it to full manifold vacuum. If you see the gauge fluttering that's also indication of a burnt/burning valve or seat issue.  If all these tests have passed, you can pull all the spark plugs and pull the power wire off the coil, and crank the engine over while you listen around at all the spark plug holes. If you hear the ticking, its likely a piston ring issue. I've seem cylinder bores with pits from detonation cause this, and its easy to have happen on a high mileage engine especially if it runs rich. Carbon builds up and stays hot and you lose timing of the ignition causing detonation.  If you're still into it and still haven't found the sound, you can pull the rockers and push rods, intake, water pump and timing over and pull the cam. Look at the bearings for scoring or discoloration. If that fails, unbolt the cross member under the oil pan and drop the pan. Pull crank caps and look for scoring/discoloration.  If you still don't find it, time to pull it out and rebuild.  Sorry for the long post, I wanted to be thorough and give the info in the order that I would tear into it to diagnose it. Check the easier stuff first and work your way in. At the very worst, you have to pull the engine, but half your work is done already and easier because the engine is securely in place in the car.  Hope this helps!"
projectcar,3550el,targagrat,1 point,Sat May 9 06:28:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response on this. I bought a automotive stethoscope and when the probe is on the valve cover above cyl 1 it is noticeably louder than the other cylinders. I pulled the valve cover and all of the rockers are a little loose when they are not lifting but they are all solid and unmovable when they are.  Currently I am digging into the engine.  I plan pulling the heads off for a better inspection of everything. The engine was rebuilt years ago by a mystery owner and I am interested in just seeing everything for myself. The water pump  and power steering is leaking anyway so I have some work I can do along the way.
projectcar,3550el,targagrat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:46:16 2015 UTC,"Try tightening down the rockers. Generally 351's are hydraulic lifters, they shouldn't have any play. However if someone put a solid cam/lifter combo in it then there should be a gap of near 0.020"" when slightly warm (think 100-120 degrees).  I doubt someone changed to a solid lifter/cam setup though. That's generally a high rpm racey type setup and rarely done for the street. But if you ever have the intake off, check out the lifters. If hydraulic, crank them suckers down. If solid, aim for a near 0.020"" gap. That's a bit on the safe side of things.  Good luck man! More importantly, have fun!"
projectcar,3550el,zenwren,2,Sat Jun 6 08:13:05 2015 UTC,"A good way to track down a tick is to put your ear to a large screwdriver or pry bar handle and touch it around on the engine like a stethoscope. That said, my guess is collapsed lifter."

I know there is an exhaust leak because it sounds like a truck and blows quick-dry around when its in the garage but it also sounds like there is a noticeable tick in the engine.
projectcar,3550el,DrunkenMechanic,1 point,Thu May 7 04:00:34 2015 UTC,Almost sounds like a rod knock in the video. Oil pressure is good rite?  Anyway if it is a lifter I found the best thing to do is let it run 5-10 minutes then turn it off and let it sit a little and repeat. Lifters will bleed down from sitting long periods of time.
projectcar,3521fq,orange150,5,Wed May 6 13:24:18 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a universal problem for project cars.  Motivating myself with the final product has never worked. Usually I could buy the same car already finished for less money, especially when I put a value on my time. And my car projects are never that fast compared to a variety of brand new cars I could walk out of a dealership with tomorrow. It definitely helps to some degree, everyone forgets what they're working towards from time to time.  The only lasting motivation I've found is to love the process. The pride in a small job well done, the thrill of learning a new skill, just that deep satisfaction of rewarding work. I think a lot of people who embark on project cars lean this way. What often gets in the way of this is comfort, even for the most hardcore motor heads. I recommend making your shop a place you want to hang out in irregardless of if you're working on a car. Get a free couch off of craigslist, get a decent sound system, maybe a shop fridge and a grill. Come home from work/school and just hang out in the shop and you'll wind up doing some work. Have buddies over and shop it up.  The next step is to make the work itself a bit easier. Think about all the little reasons you use to justify not wrenching and try to overcome them. For example, you might have to go inside and change into dirty clothes but never make it past the couch. Get a cheap set of coveralls/jumpsuit and take that temptation out of play. 7 mil rubber gloves do the same thing, just makes it that much easier to do an hour of work here or there. I think a low rolling stool, a service cart, and some foot fatigue mats make wrenching a much more enjoyable daily experience."

projectcar,350ej1,Baron_Itchy_VonFluff,2,Thu May 7 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"Rich here. So you want to pull the 7.3 and put in a cummins?  The 7.3l were good engines.  I have seen many go over 1million km.  They had a few issues with the glow plugs going.  If you cranked the engine while the glowplug light was on, you would spray cold fuel on hot glow plugs and burn them out instantly.  The fuel return lines also had these cheap plastic caps on with rubber hoses and clamps and they would get stiff and leak and all the caps would break when you replaced the hoses.  Still, it was the best diesel that was ever available in a Ford.  Don't forget about your rear end ratio though, if they were geared low, they were horrible on fuel but pulled really good. Still, nothing beats a Cummins!"

Thanks for the info about the glow plugs / fuel. The truck is just get stuff done, so far it has been good.  Some one else I know has a 5.9 12v in a Dodge, the 5.9 engine seems to start better as it gets colder (-5 F).  A diesel fired coolant heater is a possible solution. Anyways, look forward to checking out your videos. The 4BT needs to be in more vehicles.  I like the idea of 1990's F150, manual transmission with a 4BT."

I've been building my MK1 GTI for the better part of 8 years, and I've done countless hours of research on possible engine setups that I wanted to go with.  There are tons of combo's out there, including a bunch of block and head swaps.  Personally I love NA so I went with a 2.0L 16V over bored to 2.1L with 11.3:1 compression ratio on 45 weber DCOE carbs and 276° cams.  However my other favorite engine would have to be the 2.0L 8V from the MK3 generation, you could do a really gnarly NA setup (if you have the cash) with high comp pistons big valves and a 288° or 302° cam on throttle bodies.  A great charged setup on that engine would also be stuffing on a big twin screw supercharger, also bonus point for it sounding like a fire truck.  If boost is what you are after then either the 2.0L 16V or a 1.8t swap would make the most sense.  Also 034 motorsports provides a great engine management kit for the 16V platform."

Megasquirt and Chinese turbo can also be a dirt cheap junkyard swap  I really loved my alh tdi swap in my 4 door, 150 horse and 250+ tq is awesome in a light weight mk1 and so is the mileage.  You don't need a lot of brakes in these cars, g60 or 5 lug setups are massive overkill. Fresh 4 wheel gti discs are plenty.

I am an engineer at an aircraft company that makes composite planes, so I'm a bit familiar with carbon-aluminum interaction.  Galvanic corrosion between the two is a big deal.  Not only the mating surfaces, but the fasteners.  I hope you guys used steel rivets through the carbon, or they will be the first thing to disappear.  It looks like a good amount of bare aluminum fastened to carbon.  Like I said though,  beautiful workmanship.

On the bottom, the main floor is aluminum, and there are two rows of rivets holding the perimeter panel to the frame rails, and one row of rivets holding the aluminum bottom sheet to the doubler perimieter plate.  He made extra sure that there is an epoxy fillet between the floor and the paneling / brackets so dirt and rocks can't wedge in and force the joint apart.  Without the epoxy bond you lose a lot of stiffness, which is the goal of making a composite monocoque.  He definitely has a plan!"

He's been coping roll bars his whole life, I guess he got sick of it.  Stress isn't usually an issue when you're making a performance vehicle, since torsional / warp / vertical bending stiffness is far more important.  The cars we design at work were 15k-20k ft-lb / deg torsional stiffness, and stresses are WAY below yield for even the harshest road loading.  this car should be ballpark 7-10k ft-lb/deg but the target weight is so low it shouldn't matter much."

I'm an admittedly biased loyal Toyota fan. I wanted to marry my old Supra I loved it so much. It's easier for me to find a 1UZ at a junkyard that isn't completely picked over, not so with an LS#. There are mid-90's LS400s cycling through my local Pull-A-Part constantly. Said junkyard 1UZs are all aluminum whereas an equivalent LS# would probably be an iron block truck motor. The weight and typical use cases of former Lexus and truck motors may or may not matter to you. LS# motors are awesomely compact, but the 1UZ is almost as small. Especially if you use the more recent intake that comes in from the front instead of over the side. The 1UZ is probably the most popular import V8 for swaps. Resources aren't as pervasive as for the LS series, but there's still a ton of information out there. You won't have to hear moaning about ""another boring ls swap"" :)"

The availability of go fast parts would definitely sway me toward the LSx engines, but this is mostly a weekend fun car with some occasional auto cross or maybe road course.  I'm not that concerned about the technical side of the swap.  Beyond making mounts, it's just wiring.

projectcar,34s7xh,PabstBR,3,Mon May 4 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"I had an 89, be careful of rust it'll get into the rear wheel wells and disintegrate them to nothing. Large part of why I gave her up. Past that if you want to upgrade the engine I can't recommend the 1JZ-GTE enough. It was the highest option engine for these cars in Japan so it should fit easily enough and it's just as over-engineered as the 2ZJ-GTE"
projectcar,34s7xh,inkosana,3,Mon May 4 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"Now, don't let this rub you the wrong way, but I've got to say it.  The 7M-GE and -GTE are absolute garbage, and any money you spend on them is a massive waste. Either yank the 7M and replace it with a JZ, or choose literally anything else aside from an MA70 or MX83 as your project car.  These engines/cars are gigantic sunk-cost traps, so choose wisely before you jump right in to replacing the headgasket on the 7M to get it back on the road, or whatever you're planning on doing.  It's not unlikely that you'll throw a rod through the side of the block or something like that within the foreseeable future of the headgasket replacement, and at that point after people just spent the money on the MHG and ARP studs and refreshing the head, they might as well just go ahead and build another 7M shortblock and throw it in and so on and so forth.  If you don't want to throw a bunch of good money after bad, just swap in a 1JZ-GTE or do NA-T with a USDM 2JZ-GE right off the bat. Remember, these cars have been fifteen years old or more for going on fifteen years now. There have been a LOT of people who have thought that blown up 7M's only happen to other people, but the record is pretty clear by now.  With that said, good luck and enjoy your new car!"
projectcar,34s7xh,adudeguyman,2,Mon May 4 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"I think that a 7M-GE isn't going to see all of the forces that cause the problems you might have in a turbo one.  Even then, to say that it is a massive waste is a bit dramatic.  A MHG is a good investment."
projectcar,34s7xh,inkosana,1 point,Mon May 4 20:08:37 2015 UTC,"A couple years ago, I picked up an x8 cressida, and inspired by my new purchased,two of my friends found a pair of really clean x8's just like mine, except they both had BHG's. they both did ARP studs as well as cometic gaskets, changed the oil immediately, etc etc. both cars ran great, but they each wound up shooting a rod through the block on the highway within a year, I guess from bearing damage caused by the previous owners driving around with milkshake oil. Unfortunately, the only way we could have known about that is if we had pulled both engines and torn down the bottom ends, but at that point who wants to do the machine work and buy the parts to rebuild a 7M-GE?  Amazingly, my car outlasted each of theirs, it wound up grenading the A340E maybe six months after the second 7M let go. I was sure the engine would have blown because the oil light would always flicker at idle, but I guess not. I'm sure it wasn't long for this world, but I scrapped it before I could find out the hard way."
projectcar,34s7xh,Dubloverism,1 point,Mon May 4 20:36:48 2015 UTC,MX83 owner here. The 7M's are truly garbage and as the other users are saying are a massive waste of money. I picked up my 2JZGE for $500 add up all the parts to swap it in and it should put you at $1000-$1500. Cheap for a reliable car with tons of potential. Also if you need parts all X-chassis vehicles share the same parts so be sure to look around.

projectcar,34us8o,Mo0pie,7,Mon May 4 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"If tuned for say 30 psi,  and you crank it down to 15 psi, you're good. Your air/fuel maps already have knowledge on what to do for this value through tuning. If tuned for say 15 psi and you crank it up to 30psi that's where you can run into problems. Chief amongst being the ECU having to guess what's going on at that instance. Also with a change like that did you ensure the fuel system can keep up?  If tuned on Turbo-Small and switch to Turbo-Large you are going to need to retune it, unless the flow characteristics are so similar you can hand wave it. Even then you are looking at some serious logging to make sure all is well in suburbia."
projectcar,34us8o,EMartinez86,2,Mon May 4 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ok so I wasn't too far off with what I thought would happen in scenario 1  In scenario 2 let's say I only turn it up from 15psi to 18-19psi, would you be in the clear with a supporting fuel system?  In scenario three I was more concerned with going from turbo large to turbo small. Wouldn't a smaller turbo have a different power curve? Running less boost and a turbo that spools earlier?"
projectcar,34us8o,EMartinez86,2,Mon May 4 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"For scenario 2 you could if your management system could safely manage the conditions present (knock and timing if the fuel system is good). 15 to 18 is still a 20% increase though. Might as well tune for the highest boost levels your internals and fuel system can support and bring it back down.   Either direction will have a different power curve, almost never a linear curve between turbines, correct."
projectcar,34us8o,hell_on_wheel,2,Mon May 4 20:16:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the insight. Definitely cleared up some questions I had."
projectcar,34us8o,hell_on_wheel,3,Mon May 4 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"You might be focusing too much on boost.  Remember instead that the engine is a giant air pump, and focus instead on air-fuel ratio.  Anything you do to increase air (boost) or fuel (injectors) will alter that ratio, and you'll need an ECU tune for optimal operation.  Also, anything you do to change the engine setup (timing, compression) will alter how the engine reacts to various conditions (idle, cruise, acceleration)... again, requiring a tune.  You really need a dyno to do a proper tune, unless you're getting some sort of aftermarket kit that covers all bases (from engine to blower to ECU).  A speed shop will help you out with your specifics, unless you post up here.  If you're just asking pure theory, there's tons written up on tuning, just Google away..."
projectcar,34us8o,hell_on_wheel,2,Mon May 4 19:45:07 2015 UTC,"I understand that a proper tune needs a dyno unless you're doing a complete out of box kit that includes ecu calibrations. I'm looking more into changing certain aspects to a tuned car and how it would react, and if you'd have to adjust in certain situations or you'd be fine to proceed without a new tune."
projectcar,34us8o,thefattestman22,2,Mon May 4 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"Again, don't think about boost or anything, but think about what an ECU map entails: you're setting fuel flows for varying ranges of intake pressure and engine RPM.  If you change intake pressures with any sort of mod, but you're still in the range of your ECU map, you may be ok without a new tune... though you may not be getting optimal performance: what was once the WOT section of your map may no longer be accessible if you lower your boost.  Can you bring some specifics to the thread?  What exactly are you looking to do?  What engine are you working with?"
projectcar,34ukj7,nothing_clever,3,Mon May 4 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'd use them. They also don't make silicone hoses for coolant because they seep, even though they could make extra money from unknowing 'tuners' so I guess that adds some validity.

projectcar,34ukj7,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Mon May 4 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"Silicon is what's in a computer chip.  Silicone is a great material for hoses.  I've changed all my car's hoses to silicone because it doesn't break down like rubber when exposed to different fluids (esp. the ethanol in gasoline) and a wide range of temperatures.  Also, it's much more flexible than molded rubber... much easier to install.  Spend the extra $$$ for silicone and it'll last the lifetime of the car.  If seepage is a problem then either you're using the wrong size hose, the wrong clamps or your fittings (pipes, nipples, etc) are fucked.  Don't blame the hose for that."
projectcar,34ukj7,TheGovtStealsYourPoo,2,Mon May 4 20:52:09 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but I don't think you know what seepage means. It has a liquid permeation rate that is much higher than rubber. It's good for race applications for coolant but not fuel or oil. It's good for vacuum and boost piping though.
projectcar,34ukj7,hell_on_wheel,2,Mon May 4 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"Seepage is seepage whether it's through the hose material or at the fittings.  You might be thinking it only means permeation.  Furthermore, there are hydrocarbon-impermeable silicone hoses on the market, made specifically for handling fuel and oil.  See: fluorosilicone liners."
projectcar,34ukj7,TheGovtStealsYourPoo,1 point,Mon May 4 21:27:18 2015 UTC,I saw some stuff about that but have never used them because the larger hoses are pretty pricey. Smaller stuff seems ok. Are those the ones you use?

projectcar,34s9iw,EricJ17,1 point,Mon May 4 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"So, I've done quite a bit of research on this. From reading and keeping my eyes open, it really does look like buying a logbooked turnkey car is far cheaper than building one. Even if you have fabrication skills, it looks like the quality of the cage is taken extremely seriously with no wiggle room. If the cage isn't absolutely 100% perfect it will most likely need to be cut out and redone. I'm assuming you are trying to do stage rally and not just rallycross. In Rally America novices are restricted to nonturbo 2 wheel drive cars under 3080cc or 4wd cars under 2650cc, or 3313cc if it's a pushrod engine. If it were me, I'd prefer an early Impreza or Legacy. Cheap, light, under the max displacement with ease and you can probably get some decent times with the awd. They're going to be really hard to find not in atrocious shape or overpriced though.  While I hate FWD, the consensus seems to be that learning a fwd car and switching to awd is easier than going from rwd to awd. I think the early Sentras and Celicas would be a good idea. Super easy to find and fix, parts are cheap, cars are cheap."

projectcar,34s9iw,Vok250,1 point,Mon May 4 04:51:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is brutal, but the restrictions do make sense here. I'm assuming you're in the US, so the Escort one poster suggested is non-existent and the Miata wouldn't be legal for stage rally. No open top cars are allowed, and if I recall correctly even putting the hardtop on doesn't make it legal. The 510 is still a good option in my opinion. Light and fun, but they're pricey and hard to find and you'll probably have trouble staying on course with a rwd car as a beginner. Consider a non turbo sr20 or a KA24 (which would be the better engine here in my opinion) and then you can always swap the sr20det in once you graduate out of your novice license.   Edit: At that point though I bet you'll be more interested in actually winning and you'll probably want that STI or Evo. Also keep in mind that building a legal car is expensive, but you also have to buy all of your own personal safety gear, entry to the event and spares, mainly tires. One last thing: if you're set on Datsun, I've seen the B210 built. They have a really classic rally car look to them and they're extremely cheap. Live rear axle though and I don't think they're actually great cars or you would see more of them."

There was a small but noticeable amount of silver goop that I cleaned. I suspect I need to replace cam bearings. But the tuneup worked wonders, the motor seems real strong, it needs some fine tuning, probably some carb work and an intake gasket. She is gonna be my daily driver for now, so I want to get her running good and then take the seats out and sand and repaint the floor and roof, then eventually add some carpet and a headliner. I'm gonna keep the car as original as possible, original owner had all trim pieces and original ac and condenser. The story is that he bought the car brand new in 67, he drove it for 6 years and then had to put it in storage(I'm guessing a barn or shed) , there it sat until 94. Then him and his son got it running again, drove it till 2004 then back to the barn it went. His son got the car out of storage last month and I have it now. I'm going to repaint it to that stock light green, maybe vinyl top like it was, but I don't know how hard to find that is. Seats are pretty shot, need new springs and covers.

projectcar,34p39w,tjandearl,2,Sun May 3 13:32:11 2015 UTC,"Well with cars this old it is often times difficult to find original trim pieces for them when they go missing.  So there are company's out there that make and sell recreation trim pieces.  Due to the fact a lot of these trim pieces on older cars were hand formed on with metal brakes and other tools, and the difference in how chrome plating is done (it's gotten more efficient and offers better adherence now) a well trained eye looking at a classic car can tell what trim pieces are original and what are recreations.  It lowers the specialness of the car to collectors etc.  With all original trim if OP restored it right and keeps it close to stock it could very well fetch him a pretty penny, and more importantly IMO be an awesome view into a distant time long ago when cars were built like that.

I got it running and driving but nobody wanted it. I took the entire drivetrain and hope to swap that into something down the line. I stole a ton of stuff out for my dads torino. I actually haven't sold anything from it, but i really only have a tilt column and a instrument cluster that I'm selling. I got it for 300 so it was well worth it for the drive train and a few other parts.  The 79 motor is pretty low compression so it is probably one of the lowest hp 351 made to be honest. With the newer roller cam motors being plentiful it isn't worth dumping a ton of money into a non roller motor either. My plan was to take mine get a cheap 4 barrel intake and a very mild cam and put the motor and trans into a ranger or something light where 200 hp/300tq to the wheels will still make it fast."

Don't change the wheels, you appear to have BUICK factory rallye mags which are really cool on their already. Also I see some missing trim and a cracked dash so I think what you have here is an extremely nice daily driver.  Enjoy.  Is it hot and humid where you live because if it is like Atlanta where I am I'd recommend a radiator upgrade so you never overheat.  That was one of the problems I used to experience a lot.  A nice custom built aluminum radiator will eliminate that if it's an issue.  If you can avoid gas with ethanol in it do that. If not I can put you on to a guy who sells Rochester carburetor rebuild kits of high quality with ethanol resistant parts.   I love Rivieras,  enjoy. That is a really nice fancy car.  Don't put Chinese tires on that thing either.  Edit#1000. You may want to replace the points with an electronic ignition module like Pertronix,  it depends but I've done it on all my Buicks except ironically my Riviera because it just never needed it.  But not having points to adjust can be very convenient and electronic ignition can make it easier to start.  Sorry I just keep adding things here as they come to me."

Read... read some more.

Not only will this keep you on budget, but you know where you're headed. *Zip lock bags are your friend.  As you disassemble, you can mark the bags and group like parts.  For example, when I disassembled the console in my Mustang, I bagged the hardware and zip tied the bag to the part.  Find resources.  Car clubs are a great way to meet like minded people and potentially a few helping hands when you need them.  The JalopyJournal.com forums and Hotrodders.com forums are two active places to find help.   Don't be afraid to try things.  Research it first, but you'd be surprised what you can do yourself if you're the least bit handy.   Most importantly...  enjoy the journey."

projectcar,34km2m,68torino,2,Sat May 2 03:49:48 2015 UTC,"Start with the stuff you know how to do. If you can do fluids, brake work, and minor repair, start with a car that needs that stuff. Try to find something not rusted to bits that's been sitting a long time.  Often these cars will have a bad transmission, an electrical issue, or some other problem that might have been expensive to address. For sure, if it's been sitting more than 5 years you'll be going through the brakes. Not necessarily pads and linings, but fluid, seals, and maybe/probably new tubing.   Try to build on the current skills you have and buy a car that will let you do that, not just whatever is cheap and available.   Then you can move into repainting that car, if you are so inclined. Or you can do an engine rebuild or whatever you want to do next."

The #1 way to have that car sitting around in the same or worse condition in 10 years is to start a long list of wants and to begin tearing it apart without a plan and a clear way to be and stay organized. If the people around you aren't organized, look around and see how many projects they've finished versus how many have been sitting around doing nothing for years, and will likely stay that way.

The advantages are particularly good as a lubricant on things like tappets. It's pretty much non optional on the SOHC V6 in my Alfa.  There are a lot of oils that have high ZDDP that might not call it out on the front of the label. But most oils will have a lot of info available on the manufacturers website, you'll probably find at least an MSDS (material safety data sheet). A lot of forum warriors have also had very good luck just calling up the big manufacturers and quizzing them about specifics of their product lineup.

I have read of racers running the whole season and getting good results back from the lab. Doing a $20 lab test on your oil after a track day might save you a good amount of time and money. You never know until you do the analysis and have data. Otherwise your just another werido like me making claims on the internet.

projectcar,345slp,Thedguy,2,Wed Apr 29 14:44:53 2015 UTC,"Rotella T is a great oil, I ran the synthetic in my 350 H.O. in my Camaro, and I run the conventional in everything else.  ""Diesel"" oils have a lot of detergents, which to me is a good thing. They are resilient oils that can handle many, many miles at very high compression before they start to break down. You can track down great Blackstone Labs (the premiere oil testing laboratory) reports on BobIsTheOilGuy, some with 15k+ miles between changes. Comp Cams and other manufacturers even suggest Rotella for the break in, and recommend it for the life of flat tappet cams. That being said, I am betting your cam is a roller, so the Rotella won't be as a profound difference because you have far less direct metal to metal contact, but it is still a good oil.  In cold climates, it is hard to beat a 5w40. It flows easily (even down to -30 or worse), and retains great oil pressure no matter how high the temperature gets. I ran a 10w30 from Valvoline for about 3 weeks in my 350, and while I don't think Valvoline is a bad brand at all, the difference between operating temp oil pressures was almost 10 psi.  While it is true that Rotella still has great levels of ZDDP, that doesn't mean it's the same formula of yesteryear (higher polluting version). They meet the newest regulations of CJ-4/SM, all while still maintaining ~1200 ppm of ZDDP, which few other oils come anywhere close to. For flat tappet cams this is a godsend, rollers a little less so, but it is still a great oil choice. Royal Purple and Valvoline VR-1 have great ZDDP values (~1400-1500 the last time I checked), but you pay a premium for it. Pennzoil has in the area of 200 ppm when new.   The thing you should research, if you haven't, is why the manufacturer chose that specific weight of oil, and for what climate and use, as well as what that number actually means.   The only difference between a 5w40 and 15w40 from the same company is the viscosity of the oil when cold. A 5w will have an easier time pumping than a 15w, and once operating temperature is reached, both oils have a 40 weight viscosity. A 40 weight at operating temperature is capable of a higher pressure compared to a 30 weight with the same pump simply because it is ""heavier"". This is why heavy weight oils are used in hydraulic machines (i.e. heavy construction equipment). You could run a straight 60 weight oil in an engine and get great operating temp pressures, the problem being it doesn't pump worth a shit when cold, so it has a terrible balance. You could also potentially lose horsepower in this situation because a very heavy straight weight oil (60+) would make your engine work harder against itself just to move the pistons up and down. No good.   This is why we go with the variable weight oils, so that we can have well oiled and quick starts no matter the temperature, while maintaining good pressures when warm. The opposite applies as well, a straight 5 weight oil would start really well, and stay really thin when warm, so it would get really hot at high rpm and your pressure would plummet.  Look at the climate you drive in, how hard you are on the vehicle, and let the manufacturers recommendation have a say, but there is no problem with going outside that suggestion, especially for an educated reason. There's a reason all the manuals (except the new Porsche one?) say ""recommendation"" and not ""requirement"", it's because it's variable per the conditions (climate, levels of abuse, engine modifications, etc...).   Those recommendations were for a completely stock vehicle being driven in a consistent climate, by an average driver who won't be pushing their drivetrain. If you fall outside any of these descriptions, it becomes a matter of picking an oil for your E30, not every stock E30.  Edit: Here is a great graph breaking down operating levels of different oil weights.  http://www.flitalia.it/en/fl/manuale/en/im/sae_temp.gif  You can also replace ""low and high temps"" on this graph with ""low and high horsepower"" and get a similar idea for what would be needed as power output levels climb, although it isn't as drastic as the actual ambient temperature graph would be."
projectcar,345slp,Thedguy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"It's a flat tappet, here's the M42 diagram, and for comparison, here's the M44 valvetrain diagram.  From my cursory research the 5W40 wasn't available when the manual was written and most recommend it for improved startup wear.  I did a little more research at your comment: The 07/98 published 3-series (which had the M44, basically the same engine as mine sans the roller rocker valve train) manual provides oil recommendations (as usual) and has a chart stating 15W40 between -10C and 30C, with 5W30 for the -30C to 10C range. On the other side of the thermometer image is a -30C to 30C range labeled ""Special - Oils* - most preferable.""  This appears to have been the BMW LL-98 (Longlife 1998) specification, which was superceded by LL-01. LL-01 specified oils appear to be Castrol 5W40. This seems to be the origin of using 5W40 in the older cars and the retroactive application by enthusiasts seems sensible to me. I think 5W40 wasn't necessarily a regularly available product when my car was built, as the manual lacks any such reference to ""Special - Oils."""
projectcar,345slp,Android10,2,Wed Apr 29 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah we didn't really have the technology to pull off a great 5w40 until pretty ""recently"". They did exist, but not as prevalent in automotive, it was more a motorcycle/small engine oil.  Again, the only difference between a 15w40 and a 5w40 is going to be the cold weather viscosity. If you are consistently driving at a decent temperature per those charts, your oil, even when ""cold"" (compared to operating temps), can still be well within the realm of the 15w's temperature range.   5w40's would only be used when it got colder than that, in which case you would lower the minimum operating temp of the oil without moving the maximum operating temp.  Edit: It seems like a 15w40 would be a great oil for your situation, and Rotella T is a quality oil as far as that goes. Expect the first oil change to be comparatively more dirty, because like I said it has a lot more detergent to keep a diesel clean, so it will really clean out your engine. Every oil change after that should look normal. If you go with a different 15w40, same performance with less detergent, but if you don't have a super grimey engine it won't matter.   I did 6k oil changes on my Z28, running Rotella T synthetic every time except the break in (conventional Rotella T) and about 100 miles with Valvoline 10w30, and every oil change the oil looked brand new."

Once they're all replaced, you can pull the transmission off the flywheel so that the input shaft is clear, then remove the rods and lower the jack down.  The same technique is used when refitting, so that the rods carry the weight of the transmission and you can dedicate your strength to getting the input shaft lined up properly, without the risk of the transmission falling off the jack.

projectcar,347xhv,foldinglemon,2,Wed Apr 29 00:35:14 2015 UTC,"You should really pick up a service manual for the car.. (if you don't already) I would just take them off. Try to turn the engine so that the arms aren't compressing the springs when you take each set off. And make sure not to lose anything, I'm not familiar with these engines though, so take it with a grain of salt. Are you trying to get the heads off?"
projectcar,347xhv,geking,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:25:52 2015 UTC,Pulled it off and the rocker arms came off. I touched a push rod to see if I would need to pull it out and while setting it back in the pocket dropped the motherfucker. Guess my simple repair that I just started really moving on is already done until I get the SOB out.
projectcar,3467p1,pizzaboy192,3,Tue Apr 28 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"Prep is the most important part of the job... you don't need a full day's drying, just long enough that the water's evaporated.  Get some spray detailer / quick detailer and a clean microfiber cloth and hit the areas you're applying just before you do so.  The outside temp doesn't matter much as long as it's not snowing; since the vinyl has an adhesive back, it's gonna stick fine.  You don't really need any tools since there shouldn't be any air pockets under your stripes... and if there are you can work 'em out with a finger right quick.  Good luck and show us some 'after' pics!"
projectcar,3467p1,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:15:08 2015 UTC,So it doesn't matter if I let the car bake in the sun for an hour or so so that it's warm? Warm car\cold car won't matter. That makes sense.   Any tips for keeping the vinyl straight? Line it up all at once and peel backing or just take a stab at it and hope it is straight?
projectcar,3467p1,hell_on_wheel,3,Tue Apr 28 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"The way the pros do it is with a wetting agent.  Usually some combo of water, alcohol, and/or a little soap.  Wet down the area then apply the stripes over the wetting... then you've got some time to straighten out the stripes.  The way I do it is by leaving the backing on the stripe for all but one small corner, then laying the stripe down as I want it... make small adjustments... then slowly peel the backing away while rubbing the stripe onto the car with my microfiber cloth.  1000 ways to skin this cat.

You want to makes sure the surface is clean and dry and especially not hot. When the car is hot it becomes impossible to fix errors. Start by sticking a small part of the stripe where its going to begin. Keeping the stripe off the car, bring its opposite edge to where the strip will end, and crouch down to eye level with the strip and make sure its straight. Lay it down initially and then go over it and press down each area to make it stick."

projectcar,346spe,cmiovino,2,Tue Apr 28 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts:   You shouldn't have the entire weight of the car on the wheel while removing the lug nuts. Jack it all the way, or if you prefer only enough to unload the suspension but let the tire hold itself from spinning against the ground. Don't only use the star pattern when tightening. Use it when loosening too. It prevents uneven pressure on the rotor hat, but more importantly it helps the star pattern be a habit rather than something you have to think about. For removing rust from rotor hat/wheel: Using a drill-mounted wirebrush is faster than sandpaper if there's any significant amount of rust/dirt (like if you live in New England). Did I hear you refer to the axle boot at the differential as a CV joint? I don't do much FWD but I would expect a cardan universal joint there if anything, and a CV only at the wheel. If you want due diligence stuff to check while the wheel is off, definitely eyeball the brake pads and check your rotor with an appropriate measuring caliper. Not using a star pattern won't make the wheel go off-center. Tapered/conical lug seats will center it regardless of your tightening pattern if you don't have proper hub-centric wheels. If you're torquing exactly to spec, don't forget to re-check torque after 50 miles and again at 100. I have one set of aluminum wheels that inevitably loosens lug nuts if I torque to OEM specified 80 ft-lbs."
projectcar,345tgl,MySleepingSickness,5,Tue Apr 28 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"If you are trying to keep it cheap I would use some light body filler and epoxy primer as the part you see looks okayish from the pictures.   If it were me I would try and find another valence, if you can.   Cool car."
projectcar,345tgl,TimothyRedburn,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I'm probably just being overly paranoid as I don't want the rust coming back.

Concord parts are scarce."
projectcar,345tgl,MaidenATL,3,Tue Apr 28 17:17:21 2015 UTC,It will come back eventually. Get it as clean as possible and use rust converter like ospho and do prime it fill it and DP90 it and it will last a very long time before your kids need to worry about rust bubbles.

projectcar,3438db,traxtar944,15,Mon Apr 27 23:20:40 2015 UTC,"This car has been my pride and joy for years... I have invested hundreds of hours doing the all the work below, since I'm the type of person who feels that the only way to ensure the work is done right is to do it myself. Countless invested in parts and time. The car has more new parts than used, including the transmission, axles, brake system, intake, exhaust, full suspension, paint, complete interior, audio system, battery, etc... almost all those parts have ~20K miles on it or less. The only major component original to the car is the motor, glass, doors, body, and frame, and even the motor and glass have new gaskets.  The transmission was originally a 4 speed automatic, and I replaced it with a 5 speed manual from an SE model that had the rare limited slip option. All gears were checked to be within tolerance. New axles, CV joints, and wheel bearings have been installed as well. The car is a blast to drive with the new transmission. It's truly the 4 door sports car it was meant to be. An Exedy stage 1 clutch, aluminum flywheel, polished bell-housing (needs a re-do after some oxidation), new master and slave clutch, and stainless hydraulic lines were all installed less than 10K miles ago. The aluminum flywheel lets the transmission wind up so fast that 1st gear is almost non-existent... amazingly fast off the line. Redline MT-90 gear oil and Castrol hydraulic fluid are used and keep things working smoothly. New thicker axles and ARP extended wheel studs on all 4 corners are used, along with aluminum wheel nuts. Tenzo Type R wheels and Continental ExtremeContact DWS tires are brand new, less than 5K miles.  The custom brake system consists of stock parts from different high-performance cars. The front brakes are 4 piston 300ZX TT calipers and 2004 Mustang Cobra 13"" rotors with a CNC'd steel spacer to get the caliper at the correct distance for full pad bite. The rear brakes are stock maxima calipers with larger diameter 1988 300ZX rotors for a perfectly balanced system. Fully stainless steel wrapped brake lines throughout. Castrol fluid only. This is the ultimate setup for the 3rd gen maxima.  Custom cold-air intake is routed into the front fender and the K&N filter is protected from water intrusion by the wheel well liner. The 2.5"" exhaust has a hi-flow catalytic converter, custom y-pipe, and Magnaflow muffler for improved flow.   Suspension has been totally overhauled, and is easily one of the best features of the car. This thing handles like it's on rails, with almost zero body roll. The only thing that could be added in a x-frame. BlehmCo heim joints, control arm frame brace, solid sway bars, and strut tower bars on front and back, Tokico and Koni struts, and Eibach springs make the complete package. Every rubber bushing has been upgraded with polyurethane, greased for zero squeaks. I originally had B&G 2"" lowering springs on the car but it was too stiff for daily driving (though a much better look).  The interior is, again, totally custom. The car was stripped inside and out for paint and body work, and I found a local Nissan dealership with leftover graphite grey leather skins that were a dealer-only option, and installed them over new black carpet for an contrasting look. The headliner and pillars were stripped and covered with black alcantara material. Matching floor mats are included. Every interior light, including the HVAC controls and gauge backlighting has been replaced with LEDs. The main gauges have an electro-luminescent cover added that glows red/blue at night when the headlights are turned on. I've also added switched blue LEDs to all 4 foot-wells and inside the vents for a pretty cool effect at night. The Gauge pods lights are also on that same switch. A Momo steering wheel is mated to an NRG quick-release hub for sporty look and added security. NRG products are also used for the carbon shift knob, and e-brake handle. A custom black leather shifter boot with graphite french seams finish it off nicely.  Audio system is one of the best I've ever heard. The entire car was insulated in Damplifier Pro when the interior was out, and all wires were replaced with 10 gauge RCA's for amps and speakers. The amps are fused and powered/grounded by 0 gauge wire. Diamond Audio amps with JL audio subs and Cadence competition component speakers sound fantastic. A Pioneer premier touchscreen head-unit with GPS, DVD, HD Radio, and iPod connector is included. Absolutely zero rattles at full power. The car has been fitted with a CrimeStopper alarm with extra distance (1 mile) and tilt-sensor (no stolen wheels) add-on.  Exterior has been fully stripped, dents filled, primed, wet-sanded, and painted with a Mercedes Designo Mystic White with 2 base coats of white and 3 coats of clear. Truth be told, I have not even buffed this car yet after the paint. It looks amazing as-is, and I can't imagine what a good buff would do. The trunk reflector was deleted replaced with a sheet-metal fill panel in the paint process and really transforms the rear end into something totally unrecognizable. An ultra-rare Stillen fiberglass spoiler and commonly-used lip kit really make the car something else. I grafted on BMW side mirrors with turn indicators for a modern look.

projectcar,3438db,perfecttttt,3,Tue Apr 28 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"It's still more of a project car than anything.  It totally kills me to sell this car, but I recently relocated to Texas for a career move, and the car is being neglected since I don't work on it anymore. I couldn't take it with me so it’s currently being stored in Bartlett, IL. I really never pictured myself selling it, but the distance is proving to be too much of a hardship...  I have to let it go and cut my losses.  The car was my daily driver all through college and beyond, until I purchased my current daily driver 4 years ago. At that point, the car was covered and stored, and has been sitting relatively untouched ever since, save for being periodically started and ran for 30 minutes every few months. Car fires up instantly, so no issues there. All the belts are new (including timing belt). Coolant hoses are good, but if you want to replace them for your own piece of mind, totally understandable. 5 Big boxes of miscellaneous replacement parts that I've either upgraded (like the fuel pump mentioned below) or need to install (headlight parts and replacement body parts) are included in the sale. I have hundreds of pictures from the paint process, audio install, interior replacement, etc are available.  Digital receipts are available for almost every nut/bolt/washer purchased since 2006. I also have the factory service manual for repair help. This car is for someone familiar with Nissans (and cars in general) and isn't afraid of putting in some minor work to get a car that NOBODY else will be driving or even recognize. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I can obviously talk about this car for hours and hours. I also offer phone assistance with any issues to the new buyer as piece of mind. I was an active member of maxima.org for many years and very active in the 3rd gen community until I purchased my replacement daily driver 4 years ago. I'd like to see the car move on to a good home.  WHAT MAKES THIS A PROJECT CAR:   The two jobs to get this car road-worthy again are the headlights and fuel pump issue described below... the fuel pump fix should be relatively easy. I recently drove the car around the block and it kept popping the fuel pump fuse, so for that reason you'd need to trailer it home. The headlights are a totally custom job that involves mating the back half of a BMW M3 light housing with the front glass of the Maxima. The Xenon HID ballasts are wired and all parts are included with lots of replacements (like the CFL angel eye rings, bulbs, etc). The only thing left is to figure out how to mate the glass to the housing (I think a 3D printer would be best, to make an intermediary part that perfectly blends the two). I've already done the hard part of trimming out the metal to fit the larger light housing. I'd say the job is 75% done since all the parts are there except that intermediary mating piece I mentioned. Mileage is unknown. When I replaced the transmission and gauges I couldn't match the odometer. It currently reads ~30K miles and the car had ~100K when the work was done. As said, almost EVERY part on this car has been replaced in the last 4 years I drove it, save for the engine which has a new timing belt. If you took off the valve covers, which I did recently, you'd have no idea the engine has over 100K miles on it. There is a bit of blow-by when at full throttle in 1st gear. I use synthetic Mobile 1 only and change it every 5K miles religiously. The VG30E engine has been known to go well over 300K+ miles without issue. I noticed that there might be some clutch slippage, but I'm not 100% sure since it's been awhile (either way the clutch is new, so an upgrade to Stage 2 is up to you) The LED that illuminates the odometer has a bad connection and flickers at times. A quick solder job would fix it right up. One of the pillar gauge lights needs to be re-soldered as well. The metallic paint I used on the trim pieces has started bubbling, probably from off-gassing of the plastic. I have a full set of stock interior pieces ready to properly paint or install as-is. The passenger side A-pillar and center console arm-rest have faded over the years, but replacement fabric will be included in the sale. Alternatively, you could try to spray it with fabric dye and see how it turns out. A very easy job, regardless. The original door card fabric was replaced with graphite vinyl to match the seats, but started to pull away at the edges. Re-application of contact cement or 3M Super 77 spray would fix it without issue. I wanted to add black piping around the door inserts to finish the job nicely, but that's just me. The exhaust flex-section has a small leak, and some of the welds have surface rust. I've included a new flex section and glass-pack Cherry Bomb secondary muffler to bring down the noise level... but they will have to be welded in. Front passenger side speaker crossover had some rust from some water intrusion at the window. That water intrusion was addressed, but the crossover should be replaced or cleaned up. Not a big job, just under the list of things I had to do but now can't. The black paint around the side mirrors has started cracking where I used body filler. A minor job that can be done at home with minimal knowledge of body work. There is a tiny rust spot on the driver’s side rear wheel well near the bottom of the door that's starting to bubble. I'd recommend addressing it before it goes through the paint. I also recommend giving the car a coat of underbody protectant to prolong the car's life if it stays in Chicago winters."

I actually don't care for them too much on most BMWs, but I think they'll look fantastic here. And let me say I love the reflector delete on the trunk, because I haven't said that yet.

Then I decided it would just be cheaper to do a N/A build.  I ended up spending even more than if I had just stuck to my guns and done the turbo build.  I would have ended up with a tamer motor and a LOT more power.  So, I would have gone turbo if I were to start from scratch again."

projectcar,343cjv,neuropsyentist,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:11:28 2015 UTC,I drag race and it's a daily driver.  Stop and go traffic with a manual sucks.  Autos are more consistent and easier to get down track.

I also owned a 2002 Camaro SS 6-speed that wasn't fun in traffic either.  Riding the clutch, constantly shifting between 1st and 2nd and popping it into neutral for an hour can get tiring really quick.  Driving on curvy roads and auto-crossing was fun.  An auto is really the way to go for a straight line car and/or a cruiser/daily driver."

The 5MGE isn't very popular (although it doesn't eat through head gaskets like the 7MGE does) as JZs can be had for cheap (Just got a N/A for $500). Customization options for the body are few unless your willing to fabricate. Other than that I would say go for it.

I had to redo almost my entire subframe. You have tons of room in the engine bay. Hybridz.org is a great forum for them and Victoria British (now Black Dragon for Zs) makes catalogs with parts breakdowns for like every part of the car so you can see how things go together. Their wiring is also easy to understand. I even made a 280zx work with a 300zx MAF and ECU by soldering proper wires from diagrams found on auto zone to get rid of the ""flapper"" style air meter. Zs are the cars that I learned on and I will always love pre-300zx Zs."

projectcar,33vq9y,cumslikepeternorth,6,Sun Apr 26 04:02:13 2015 UTC,"Good on the 2bbl heads.  4bbl are for racing only IMO.  They are a do at daily driving rpms.  That FMX is a decent tranny, had one originally but killed it doing street racing.  Lots of cheap pot metal parts, like old die cast hot wheels cars.  If it dies, look for a C6 as a replacement.  Different bellhousing, but a heck of a lot more parts out there.  Also, if you haven't had the heads reworked for unleaded gas, they will eventually eat themselves unless you use a lead additive.  The valve guides and seats need to be changed out to bronze IFIRC.    Treat that back glass with kid gloves.  They are hard to find and pricey when the get broken.  If your trunk is not already rusted out.  Get on it.  I sold mine only after the supports for the fuel tank under their were rotted beyond reasonable repair.  Door handles are also cheaply built.  Use dry graphite powder on them regularly so they do not develop stress cracks.  Oh and the rear brakes, when you do them, check the rear axle bearings.  Mine started growling on a long trip and seized up on the highway and left me with a fat bill at the Ford dealer.  No one else could source the bearings on short notice.    Don't bother with the ram air.  It was a gimmick and only did anything at 70 MPH.  Cowl hoods work well, ram air NACA scoops are just dirt collectors and water traps even when plumbed correctly.  With today's ethanol blended fuel, get used to rebuilding that carb regularly.  I'd get a spare and just swap them out so you are not fighting a tune each and every time.  Oh, toss the points and get a Petronix solid state unit for in the distributor.  Had my points set up lose a condenser in the middle of nowhere florida.  Engine died and I coasted into a one horse town at dusk on a Saturday.  Only garage was was an old guy that had boxes of old parts, covered in dust.  Had me running in under a half hour.  Luckiest timing I've ever had with a car problem.  Now I run Lexus and Honda.  Tired of crawling under Detroit iron while stuck somewhere or chasing down a part that is just as poorly built as the original that failed.  Keep the old muscle cars you get as toys.  Do not rely on them for transport.  I'm just glad I never got in an accident with any of them.  Tin cans that would have left me in a body bag.  With that Mach 1, the best way to drive it is to pretend someone is always in your rear and side blind spots.  Accelerate  hard to clear both lanes, before you pass anyone or move over.    Paint it flat black and forget the stripes.  Mad Max it hard.  Screw the shiny paint posers.    Good luck!"

I gotta figure out what the past owners did/didn't to the ignition system as they converted over to duraspark I. But I have heard good things about petronix.  And I always keep that in mind when driving and try and keep my distance from others, but I agree.

projectcar,33vq9y,kdryan,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:38:41 2015 UTC,"Very cool with the duraspark.  You don't need the pertronix now.  Points problem solved with a factory fix.  As far as going to a four speed, I would not do it myself.  That is a heavy, ungainly car.  You aren't going to be able to toss it around like you do a Miata or smaller Mustang.  Getting the pedals in and cable set up will be quite exhaustive and it will be a headache from what I have read about others that have gone that route.  Just get your C6 built for quick, firm shifts and it will impress  even the hard core manual guys when you go full throttle.  Get a quality high build primer that you can spray with a compressor and gun, to block out that white paint if you go dark.  Find the paint supply place locally that the garages use and make friends there.  If you really scuff the paint and lay down the new advanced primers, you can then sand the body to a respectable level to then spray a real two stage paint job.  Key here is to find a clean, well lit garage to do it in.  Don't scrimp on your resperator filters.  Get the ones that filter organic solvents like paint fumes.  Most filter inserts are just rated for particulates.  Also if you strike a deal with a shop that you will do the body sanding and they will just shoot the primer and flat black with a flat clear to protect the paint and make cleaning a snap, they will probably do it for under $500 plus materials.  Depends on your area though.  Make friends and don't be afraid to say it is not in your budget and walk away.  Just be polite.  These shops lose all their money in body work and repaints over flaws.  If you let them know ahead of time you are looking for more Mad Max than show car, you might just get them on board for a sweet deal, just to do something different for a change in their shop.  A lot are assholes though, so research the shops before hand by talking to older guys in the area.  Cars shows are the way to meet owners and talk paint.  Everyone has a paint shop story in the car hobby.  Good on you staying safe.  These cars are like old fighter planes.  They want to kill you every time you 'fly.'  Radio off, ears on your ride.  They talk to you and with a good sense of smell, many problems can be caught early."

Took it down to bare metal, used marine clean, used metal ready, etc etc. several coats of por 15, several coats of their own self etching primer and there was rust coming through by the next spring. I was pretty upset. I think it tends to work quite well on existing rust though. I have a friend who just slapped it on some rust over a wheel well and it appeared to hold up fine."

You can buy half done projects but you need to both get an awesome deal (we paid about half market value because there's so many unknowns and it wasn't running), and do a super comprehensive evaluation of the car before hand.

We'd done an Austin-Healey Sprite before, and its just a more attractive (IMO) copy of it, so we already kind of knew what we were getting into.   Fortunately, even the first time around since it's a car with pretty awesome forum support, there was nothing we ran into that someone else hadn't already fixed a million times.   Now IDK about the old Celicas, but if there's good forum support or books available and parts aren't hard to find or expensive I wouldn't worry too much. Just make sure you really like the car because it will probably take a shit ton of your time even if everything goes right.   Except if there's body/frame rust. Then I say find a different one. I will just about never buy a rusted out car."
projectcar,33tn5c,1989toy4wd,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:22:58 2015 UTC,Rust is my main concern. I like the car and I can see myself working on it. And I plan on working on it with my dad that has some mechanical knowledge (but never done anything like this). So we have to find a car that we both like and decide where to go with it.
projectcar,33tn5c,barnstormer12,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:29:10 2015 UTC,And would that reason might be? I mean why would someone stop working on a project? possible reasons other than running out of money?

Like  excessive bondo repair was found adding thousands of dollars to the bill. Or sudden catastrophic engine failure. The fact that this particular car is primered, I would have rather of seen it in the original paint so I could assess the amount of rust that is extremely common on old toyotas."
projectcar,33tn5c,buy_a_pork_bun,2,Sat Apr 25 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't know the European car market at all. BUT, I do know project cars.  Buying a partially finished car is a gamble. You could get a car that is ready to finish, has all the parts, and is basically a Lego set waiting to be assembled. Or, you could get a project that someone was working on until they discovered really bad rust, or previously unnoticed crash damage, etc. As with any car, (and x100 for non-drivers), inspect it REALLY closely. Things that would be a ""I'll fix it later"" or minor inconveniences on a car that otherwise runs and drives might be ""gee, I didn't notice that the car had been rear-ended, and now the driveshaft is 3 inches too long"". Or, ""yeah, the engine is there, but I didn't notice that the ECU is missing, and it's $1000"".  FWIW, I've done both of these things. I treat non-runners as if they are a pandora's box of problems, that you won't even notice until you already have thousands of dollars (or euros, kronor or pounds) invested.  The summary, a non-running project car can be 10x more project than you expect. And a buyer that doesn't know the year of the car is suspect (is there a clear title? I don't know the process in Europe). Also, the fresh primer right before a sale is also suspicious to me, A project like that I'd want to see in bare metal. At the least, magnet test all over the car looking for body filler or fiberglass. A little knowledge as to where the likely places for structural rust might occur is helpful. All things being equal, I'd pay a lot (LOT!) less for any ""needs to be assembled"" car than a similar runner. If nothing else, the little stuff (screws, sealants, trim pieces, etc) will kill your budget and enthusiasm trying to chase down. If you get serious about the car, inventory every little piece the seller has to make sure you aren't missing anything crucial or really expensive.  Good luck!"
projectcar,33tn5c,WalkOn30,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:44:17 2015 UTC,"First of all the ad title says its a 71 but in the description (written by the seller) he specifically states its a 74. I dont know why. In the description he also states that all the parts that are missing (wheels, grills, etc) are available but not installed cause of the primer. And now thats what I dont get. Why bother with a primer and sell it? maybe it had an accident, I dont know. I obviously will inspect the car thoroughly IF I decide to give it a shot, but TBH I'm a bit of a car noob so any help as to how I should inspect is welcome. Where should I look for rust? What should I look for if it had an accident?  As for the interior I have no idea of its condition other that the description saying its stock.   The price from what I've seen around here is not that high. And if it runs I dont believe bolting all the missing stuff is such a big deal (IF they are available)."
projectcar,33tn5c,TheGarp,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"For rust, first look anywhere water might collect. Inside the doors (check along bottom seam), trunk floor, etc. If you see anything that looks suspicious, poke it with a small screwdriver or knife point to see if it is solid. Get down on the ground and look closely at the bottom. Suspension points, body seams, floors... cars can rust anywhere. Check where the battery sits, often acid will kill the paint early in the cars life and start rusting early. Rust can be anywhere. You'll need to really look.  Things to consider: What would it cost to paint the car? (can you do it yourself or will you have to pay someone?) What will the rest cost to finish? Will the car need tires? Brakes?  Cars that have sat without running for a long time often need the gas tank removed and cleaned/sealed. How are all the belts and hoses? Dry rotten and cracked? Electrical stuff: Battery?  Does the transmission work? Clutch? Things can really add up when you can't evaluate them with the car running. Assume it will need everything.  Really add it up. Often once you start writing it down you'll see the number get BIG! (right off the bat I think this car would need at least another $1000 before it's a driver and that is if (and ONLY if) every part it needs comes with it AND you do every bit of the labor yourself.  If you are new to car wrenching and projects, I'd recommend a running car to start with. Even if it's not cool or doesn't pull in the opposite sex like mad (whatever your preference is) you'll get a ton of good experience replacing a water pump on a mid 90's crappy Toyota (and then driving it !) that will come in handy for your ""someday I'll get it finished"" project car.  Honestly, it doesn't sound like you really love this car. If you aren't an early Toyota fan, and really searching for a 70's Celica, I'd take a pass at this point. Or, if you love it, work with the seller. Maybe offer to help for a day or two and get the car running. If it is really a job of putting it together and firing it up, then you are all set. If you discover a big flaw (internal engine problem, transmission, etc) you can RUN!"

Add a collar with some stiff springs and you're good to go in front. Then, you can go with the same Koni yellows in the rear with 30mm torsion bars and it will make a huge difference.  The stock Sachs suspension is very soft.  You'll get a lot of body roll from it.  Don't worry about the flywheel, you could do that if you do a clutch change. If there is no history, it probably has the original rubber clutch, which is kinda crappy.  I wouldn't go any less than 11 lbs. as it will make it very difficult to drive and eat up clutches really fast. It takes a seasoned 944 mechanic 12 hours to do the clutch..."

Putting a headlight housing in there can be done, and relatively easily, but I would compare maybe a little older street bike to find one that the angles are closer.

My first thought when looking at this is that that fairing looks very very similar to one off of a ninja 500 or ex-500. That's where I would start. You're gonna need turn signals as well to make it street legal so I would again go with the ninja. The light is a little boxy, but I think it would be the best fit.

projectcar,33m765,Corrupt_Reverend,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"First, many ""Track only"" bikes are track only because they cannot be made street legal.  It's not about the lighting package, but the branding on the title.  Is the title clear?  If it's ""parts only"" or ""scrapped"" or ""Destroyed"" you cannot put it back on the road without a new VIN and title. IE buying another frame and title.  If it's ""salvage"" then depending on your state you may be able to have it inspected.  Now, assuming your title is good, I would strongly recommend getting non-race fairings and a stocker headlight.  The angles are awefully important and that hayabusa headlight is going to light the road about 6 ft in front of you.  Also, if you need to pass an inspection, most street fighter headlights won't work because they aren't DOT/FMVSS approved.  If you aren't concerned about lighting, and you don't need to get it inspected but just need to make it less likely to get you pulled over while squidding, then go for it.  Or duct tape a flashlight to the fairing, or use a ""streetfighter"" headlight."

My dad respected it's new ownership (perhaps a little too much ) and let it sit and rot. I decided enough was enough and bought it from my brother. She's in pretty poor shape.

projectcar,33jizc,ssshield,2,Thu Apr 23 04:52:54 2015 UTC,"Former 3000GT/Stealth guy here.  The early nineties AWD cars had the ""getrag"" transmission.  They are notorious.  They were built in Germany and after the factory made the contracted number of them, that was it.   There just aren't parts for them. The most common type of car you'll come across on these is either early nineties ""just a transmission problem"" and all years ""needs a valve job, smokes a bit"".  The valves on the Stealth/3kGT were soft and would bend/tulip over time.  They honestly were pretty good cars if a high school kid didn't get his hands on it, but once the motors hit about 130k that was about it for the car.  No one ever really got a handle on how to rebuild the motors right, and there wasn't a good source of crate motors.  They were fun cars for sure and probably one of the favorite cars I've ever owned.  If you were a young guy in the nineties through about 2005, they were the shit.  After that they've just faded to history.   For a first car look at something that has lots of support forums and an active community.  My family car is a Honda so the wife doesn't have to think about it.  My car is a Jeep cuz it's easy to work on."

Late 80s German Muscle is pretty solid, Old BMW M3/M5/M6, if your budget allows for it, get a 2002 or 2002tii, sexy rally car if you make it right, Benz AMG SEC 560 is a seriously ""Muscular"" Car, I'd kill for one of those  Volvo and Mini can make really neat ""rally cars"" in their own way, but it depends entirely what you're after I suppose. To be honest going between Muscle and Rally you're talking apples and oranges for the most part, I'd go ahead and say that Britain and Germany would be your best bets for any US Muscle cars based on the large US populations during the cold war etc.?   Second thought: What about some of the Old Euro-Fords like the Ford/Lotus Cortina, Ford Escort, Ford Taunus or my favorite, a Ford Capri?"
projectcar,33ilxq,MacAttack0711,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:59:19 2015 UTC,Not really a fun of the old BMWs but the 2002tii doesn't look bad and its similar to the e30 lookwise. Which is the only BMW I like.   The ford Capri or the cortina look great and hadn't thought of them. The escort even though the mk1 is amazing and absolutely love the look its a bit too small and don't know about part availability on that one.   Other cars that I had in mind were Jensen interceptor (but I can't find any obviously) or an mgb or Jensen Healey.
projectcar,33ilxq,tjandearl,2,Thu Apr 23 06:07:37 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about a 70s/80s era BMW.  The e30 3 series (1982~1991) can be had pretty cheap and parts are readily available globally.  They're simple carborated cars with tons of space in the engine bay, and even good aftermarket parts.  Bmws are like legos too it's simple to fit a newer bmw engine and drive train into the car.  Meaning you could take an e30 318 and put the s52 from an e36 m3(3 series 91-99) and have a fun car at the end."

It required minimal work to get running/driving and the body is very straight. This car has been in possibly a couple accidents already and ""its only a 6 cylinder"". Nothing wrong with a 6 cylinder, but if you ever want to swap to a v8, you have to getting all of the v8 driveline related parts, IE all of the steering/front suspension items, engine, transmission, and axle. Things to look for in terms of rust on these cars are the floor pans, trunk area, all of the frame rails, bottom of doors and rear quarters. If the car has floor pans that have been blessed by the local church (holy, hehe) then you can assume that the cowl is rusted through (the area with the vents in front of the wind shield) and that is a somewhat easy, but tedious area to replace/work on."

""I tried to get some replacement parts, but I couldn't find them all/it needed too many new parts""   The car will need to be towed.

You basically just do a whole bunch of half-second tack welds. As long as your mig is set up correctly, the sheet metal is aligned fairly well, you hold the gun the right distance from the body, and you move the welds around so you don't heat up and warp the panel, it doesn't take any special skill."

projectcar,33hwfa,DanBeardTheGreat,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"I've got to disagree with you that mig is the most versatile. You can't make imperfection free welds with wire transfer the way you can for GTAW or SMAW, and you're really only able to weld mild steel (or aluminum). IMO GTAW is the most versatile, but is also one of the slowest and requires a high initial skill."
projectcar,33hwfa,darthchurro,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:16:29 2015 UTC,"Okay versatile in the sense that it works with everything, but a tig isn't going to be in the beginner welders budget. For 90% of most peoples welding requirements a mig will do.  I admit you're not going to be welding 1"" steel with a mig, but the average garage will never do that anyway. And yes you can do shitty welds, but with a tig ur gonna blow holes through ur metal if ur not careful. All in all they all have their pros and con's, and skill level required....

projectcar,33earb,Schultzz_,2,Tue Apr 21 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"Is the 1450 weight with fluids or no?  Like the idea, I don't think its up my alley however...too heavy for my taste... (Ive become a snob I know..)"
projectcar,33earb,Schultzz_,2,Wed Apr 22 05:28:24 2015 UTC,"That is the weight of the first prototype with all fluids and 2/3 of a tank of fuel.   However, this car used 1.5 inch OD .095 wall tubing in a few places where 1.25 inch OD .065 wall and 1 inch OD .065 wall tubing would be more than strong enough (the short diagonals between the lower and upper frame rails, for example). We will save over 25 pounds by changing these.  The prototype reused the donor Cobalt seats. Each seat weighs just over 40 pounds. Swapping to aluminum racing seats can save about 25 pounds a piece.  The prototype also uses the stock wheels that weigh about 18 pounds a piece. Replacing these with some really nice aluminum wheels can save another 30 pounds.  There are a few other things like aluminum brake calipers and aluminum body shocks that could save some more weight.  It seems possible to get the car down to 1300 pounds."
projectcar,33earb,MyspaceIsStillCool,2,Wed Apr 22 12:41:10 2015 UTC,"1300 would be very nice too. Im glad it has lots of room for improvement   My dream car in this segment is the rocket, the first car with a motorcycle engine on the market. I don't think much holds a candle to it, maybe a 2-11 or atom but none are close to its weight. Also there was a car in scandinavia that was even lighter but it looked goofy.  http://imgur.com/a/3vKWO"
projectcar,33fr8g,CornerOfTheOval,2,Wed Apr 22 03:52:43 2015 UTC,"The major limiting factor would be any rust or body work, at least in my opinion.  I would be looking at the frame and making sure there isn't any rust or shoddy repairs. I would also take a look at the floor pan and the trunk pan. After that, is the car straight, or has it been wrecked? And finally, make sure that there is clear title. After that, you can fix anything mechanical pretty easy and probably cheaply.  If all you need is a tune up and a paint job, go for it (provided you can afford those things). But if the frame is rotten or there are giant holes in the floor pan or shock towers, I would pass. It will cost a lot to get those fixed, especially if you aren't handy with a welder.  Another thing to watch out for would be if some guy started on a restoration, disassembled everything, then lost interest. You might be getting a car that has a good frame and looks nice in theory, but you will end up having to spend all the time putting everything back together. You'll also have to pray that you get everything needed to put it back together. A couple bolts or panels missing and then you gotta hunt for those things and pay for it."

projectcar,33fr8g,trippinholyman,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"It would be easier for a mechanic with a lift. As for checking the frame, you can get under it on the ground or jack it up a little and take a look."

projectcar,33co38,damn_u_scuba_steve,2,Tue Apr 21 15:55:59 2015 UTC,Can you list the costs? I'm really curious as I might stand a big project myself the first time.
projectcar,33co38,slamjeez,2,Tue Apr 21 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"Well I got into a lot of other stuff in addition to the headgasket, mostly the exhaust work and new tune. Taking that out of the equation we're looking at about $360 for the machine shop work on the cylinder head, $225 for the HG set, $18 for the head bolts, ~$100 for 2 changes of oil and 1 filter (you'll need to change the filter twice as well if you had coolant getting into your oil). $45 for new antifreeze.   I ended up spending another $80-100 when I realized I needed timing guides and of course racked up a pretty decent bill on various tools and consumable stuff (gloves, cleaning supplies, towels, etc). I also borrowed probably a couple thousand dollars worth of tools, a massive torque wrench, a smaller, digital extremely accurate torque wrench, the VANOS timing tools, etc.  It is really difficult to figure out exactly what a project will cost before you get started. I recommend immersing yourself in project threads to get a feel for what tools you need and what might go wrong. Figure out what you can borrow and what you need to rent/buy, figure out the cost for that and the replacement parts  you think you need, then add 50%. The first number is what you'd like to spend, the second number is what you're prepared to spend if you have to. That's a good methodology that'll keep you from getting in over your head."

projectcar,32y0sw,Deltigre,3,Sat Apr 18 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"They're for non-OBDII cars. They hook a hose up to the tailpipe with the sensors that are normally a part of an OBDII system in it to measure the output of the contaminates.

I searched for and found a '95 GSR because it's OBDI. I had plans to put a JDM H22A into it, and in my county there's no ""sniffer"" test for OBDI cars and older, just visual to make sure a catalytic converter is installed and any underhood emissions stuff is still hooked up and not in obvious disrepair. OBDII cars require being hooked to the machine and they must pass, so swaps are much tougher.   I rolled into the inspection station with my car all done, and the mechanic just laughed and said ""You planned this swap better than any other people I see come in here. Good job."" Passed. Aww yissss!"

projectcar,32y0sw,Emperor_Septim,3,Fri Apr 17 20:02:36 2015 UTC,You can't remove the cat and be legal.  Removing the cat from a car that came with one and running it on the road is a violation of federal law.  The clean air act.  No reason to run a street car without a cat anyway.  It's worth so little power and we're talking about a massive reduction in emissions compared to the gains you get.
projectcar,32y0sw,Nurfur,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:02:36 2015 UTC,What about turbo cars?
projectcar,32y0sw,cweave,4,Sat Apr 18 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"? Definitely still illegal.  Obviously there are some gains to be had but what's the point of doing that on a street car?   The gains are still tiny compared to the amount of emissions produced.  People underestimate what cats do.  They turn large quantities of highly poisonous (to people, not things like trees and spotted marmosets) gas into CO2 and water.   For the miles a street car drives it's really not a good thing to be doing, and you don't need every last tiny iota of power.  For a track car sure.   Just get a high-flow cat.  Legal in 49/50 states."

projectcar,32vxlt,Snowreaper,2,Fri Apr 17 08:20:14 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about the Community college thing. I'm going out on a limb here, but even if your experienced it would still be a good choice. 1- Networking, surrounding yourself with like minded people that share your interests of never a bad thing. 2-access to equipment that you simply don't have, like a paint booth or a lift, or an engine hoist and stand. 3- you'll save money. Lift rent if available usually starts at $75 an hour from what I've seen. Also the costs of taking your project to a shop if you get in too deep, could easily pay for a semester's worth of classes. Not mention how much you'll be spending on tools.  Sure you'll want a set of your own no matter what. But just starting out, you definitely won't have everything you need. Some single sockets can cost $20 a piece just on their own! Also cheap/free storage with no HOA's getting all pissy. Bottom line, it just full of win all the way around."

projectcar,32vxlt,kuppajava,6,Fri Apr 17 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"One suggestion, make a project list of reasonable jobs once you get the car, start by changing out all of the fluids, checking belts and hoses and tires and brakes.  This way you are starting out by doing the most easily done maintenance and cleaning (I cannot stress cleaning enough, make sure to note any and all rust, rust is the true enemy) that was designed to be done by any handy person to see if you actually enjoy doing this stuff.  Whatever you do, DO NOT start out by ripping down the entire car into pieces the first day or even in the first year! Only tear it down far enough to do the one job you are working on and then button it all back up, do not allow mission creep to take place! Too many times a project car becomes a million parts in someone's garage that overwhelms the person so they end up putting off doing anything to it!  Just break down as little as you need to for the one job you are doing and then put everything back and go on to the next job, do this for the first year at least!"

Rebuilt the entire brake system front to back last year just off watching YouTube videos and many trips up to Napa.  Working on the interior body work now and getting to do a fair amount of welding,  grinding,  body-filler,  sanding, and paint work....

It's better to spend more initially for a properly running project that is rust free, running, etc than to buy something out of a field that needs several thousands of dollars to simply run, then you have to work on interior, upgrades, etc."
projectcar,32vxlt,Not4Reel,2,Fri Apr 17 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"I redid a 1973 Bronco a few years ago and had an amazing time. I love the way you can buy every part, nut, bolt from Wild Horses in California. Broncos have been going up in value like crazy over the past few years and excellent resale market. Best of luck and remember there is help at ClassicBroncos.com and various local sites like ColoradoClassicBroncos.com with write ups, pics, reviews, classifieds, etc to make the process easier knowing you have support from amazing group of fellow Bronco lovers. Best of luck."

If you set a finish date, you will find yourself cutting corners. Don't try to rush into getting it street legal as well when its half painted and assembled. Just be patient and wait till the very end when you'd be PROUD to be seen in it."

You'll definitely need a garage, steady income, and a solid car (the LEAST amount of rust you can get is the better). Make sure the car was never wrecked. Make sure you get a title and get it notorized. Clear all legalities before buying! Other than that, good luck!   But make sure you learn the BASICS of auto work. Dont torque shit down with power tools. Tighten things in a cross pattern working from the inside bolts to outter. Use jackstands to hold cars up. Read up instructions. Dont cut corners. Be OCD about keeping shit organized. And that means tools AND car parts (right down to the bolts and nuts). keep a clean work area. Keep your car stuff clean. Working on an engine?

It's just the way it is with such a delicate media. One thing to note is that coal slag is very rough, and will prematurely wear out the hose and the nozzle, and even the inside of the gun. Use something like aluminum oxide for paint and rust removal. It still won't help much for grease and oil buildup, but once you soak them or wipe the majority of that off, blasting will be quick with the aluminum oxide."

On the plus side you can get a newer engine with with less then 50k miles for about the same price as getting an engine from another Firebird or Camaro.

As for what engines will work any  GM 3800 series 2 and series 3 engines will work from 98-08. If the engine you get is from a front wheel drive vehicle you will have to take everything off your current engine and swap it over to the new engine.  Add about $250 for new gaskets, plugs, and wires. If you have any more questions on it just ask."

projectcar,32s1qk,trippinholyman,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:39:31 2015 UTC,96 came with either a 3.4 or 3.8. If it has aluminum heads it is a 3.4.  Not great on power but a decent engine for what it is.  Same basic concept as above for the 3.8. You can use an engine from a front wheel drive if needed or just the heads.   But you might be lucky and it only has cracked intake gaskets. But you wont know for sure untill you start taking it apart.
projectcar,32s1qk,d3310n,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:48:36 2015 UTC,"Might want to take the head to the machine shop. They would be able to tell you if it's warped. They could even machine it for a fee.

You can swap in a low mile 3800 for less than $1000 and be driving it in no time.  Ls swap is a little more in depth than just an engine swap. You would need to get an Ls1 ECU, Gauge cluster, engine wiring harness, K- member (or modify the 3.8 k-member),  Larger radiator, and a Transmission that will bolt to an Ls engine. Plus a few other misc items that im forgetting. It will cost at least 3 times more to do an LS swap than just putting a new v-6 in it.   Although if you want to go fast and have the time and money the LS is the way to go."

projectcar,32qyh9,darthchurro,2,Thu Apr 16 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"A yardstick? Fucking LOL  You cannot use that method if you have hydraulic lifters, you would need to swap out the valve springs to checker springs or substitute in a solid lifter.  The rocker tip sweep being perfectly centered doesn't mean you're getting max lift and perfect geometry, perfect geometry and max movement of the valve comes from minimizing the sweep of the roller tip across the valve stem. So having the minimum amount of sweep is more important than having that sweep be perfectly centered...any scrubbing of the rocker top across the valve accelerates valve guide wear and is lost motion in the vertical direction.  When you measure your checking pushrod, as little as .050"" makes a difference in geometry, you need to measure with something more accurate than a yardstick...a 12"" vernier's calipers is the most commonly used tool in the industry for this.

projectcar,32pbia,Popajim07,10,Wed Apr 15 16:58:25 2015 UTC,frame repair shop owner here: get one without the rust. plenty of blown motor mustangs out there with fine bodies.
projectcar,32pbia,TheGarp,3,Wed Apr 15 17:49:13 2015 UTC,Can confirm. My sister blew out the motor on her mustang because she never checked the oil or coolant for a whole summer. The body was is amazing shape when she sold it.
projectcar,32pbia,Vok250,6,Wed Apr 15 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"I'll echo some others here: just cut your losses and move on to a car with a better body. You don't want to deal with all of that rust if it's beyond your current skill set as you say.  Can it be fixed? Yes. Is it worth it when those cars are literally everywhere? Not even close.  I'm currently doing $4k worth of rust repair and paint on a 1992 Blazer. Yep, that's right, a 92 Blazer. It's absurd, but the guy is sentimental about the thing and he won't scrap it. As I was repairing the rockers I had to get into the hinge pillar, which was like a flaky croissant roll all the way through it. That then led to the passenger floor, and when cutting out that rust I found that the body reinforcement where it sits on the body mount on the frame is all but gone entirely. The body stiffening supports under the car are also destroyed.   That shit's all not part of the quoted repair, but now I have to do it because the outer panels all rely on it for structure. Rust is never as simple as fixing what's visible from the surface. It's a nightmare.   That $7k sounds insane to you now, but when you consider all of the R&I on that job  (A TON), and that the engine has to be pulled and put back in when finished (a huge labor investment for any shop), all of the patch panels have to be bought or worse/more expensive made from scratch, they all have to be welded or panel bonded in, and that's all before any standard body work or paint that those sections need, it starts to make a little more sense. A quote that high is because that shop owner knows what it's like to get deep into a project like that and tell the customer that he has to spend more to fix it right, and then have that customer freak out because it's more than they originally quoted."

The only way that I can see to fix that correctly would be to remove the engine. I would start by getting quotes with the engine removed.   Also an old pushrod 5.0 is not a direct bolt in on those cars. I'm 95% sure the k member is different. Aftermarket k members accept both 5.0 and 4.6/5.4 modular blocks. Also if you have state inspections. Getting an old pushrod 5.0 to pass a smog test will be virtually impossible. The 5.0 was OBD 1 and the 4.6 was OBD 2.

I made plenty of mistakes along the way and it was a fantastic learning experience. All I'm getting at is you're posting this as an autox build which is one thing you'd never want wheel spacers on. You risk not only safety, but adding additional weight which the z32 doesn't need. If you can't afford light weight wheels, the stock wheels clear calipers just fine and are cheap and plentiful. If you like the offset of the wheels, that's fine too but you're not building an autox car."

'88 Golf mk2 1.3petrol with carb Originally my granddad's, he didn't drive it much, spent a lot of time in the garage so it is in decent condition.   The left ""doorstep"" or whatever it is called is rusty, the winter had a bad effect, developed some few early spots on fenders but overall the original paint still looks good. My granddad had some kind of crash in the early 90' and my mechanic said last year that the left front shaft or knuckles can have something with them. It's hard to decide, when I sit in the car or put something in it it creaks. As far as I know the springs are okay but don't know for sure. The 1.3 petrol is not only weak as F but drinks fuel like a horse. My estimate is about 10l / 28mpg in city or more. I want a more powerful engine. Thinking about 1.8 8v or 2.0 8v which is relatively easy to find and swap in. Not too costy The doors are hard to close and noisy. Want to fix them in the long run. The carpet is clean mostly, I don't like the original basic style on the seats but it's not very important. I would like to find better and more comfortable seats later. The left front seat rail is broken but it holds for now. Shifting is stiff and hard sometimes (hopefully engine comes with a better gear shift) I don't like the clutch, some said fiddling with the bowden would help a lot. Don't know. Breaks are okay for now, but I strongly belive I need more powerful ones with the the new engine when it comes. Carriage needs treating probably.   I have no mechanic experience, I study cutting and CNC programming and I'm good with them but I don't know shit about cars, don't have any family member or close friend who does. I would like to learn more about cars.   Goals in order of importance:   Get rid of the rust, give it a primer. Fix the doorstep Fix the annoying sounds or have it checked for not being dangerous Get a stronger engine with better transmission Get decent brakes ( No idea what I should look for blank spot!) Get better springs, shocks? Fix carriage problems if there is any Paint the parts which had a coat of primer  Repaint bumpers and moldings Put some audio in the car Repaint original steelwheeles probably Find better seats (questionmark about the seatrail)   Link to album Apologies for small pics taken with mobile.

For holes i prefer a welder but if there isnt anything bigger than a couple cm you can get away with a lot of sanding and some fibreglass and bondo if money is super tight.  practice on the door sill until you can do a nice job and then move on to the rest of the rust. the rest of the plan looks good. the biggest hurdle for a first timer would be the engine swap.  Vw forums are by far the best resource you will find as far as which engine will be your best choice. For your first swap i would look for a kit that includes motor and trans mounts and any bits that connect the shifter linkage. your best choice would most likely be out of the same model. later motors and trans swaps can be done but would require more parts, more money and more skill."

projectcar,32m8uo,Corrupt_Reverend,2,Wed Apr 15 03:22:51 2015 UTC,Pistol for rebuilt engine. If that's not america I don't know what is.

projectcar,32m8uo,1broknrado,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:30:51 2015 UTC,did you redo the engine too? How much was the vr6?
projectcar,32m8uo,slamjeez,1 point,Sat Apr 18 08:06:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't rebuilt the motor yet, but I got the engine from the classifieds section on vwvortex for about $1,200"
projectcar,32m8uo,1broknrado,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:12:03 2015 UTC,is vwvortex a good place to look for used engines? I'm thinking about 1.8 8v or 2.0 8v for starters.
projectcar,32m8uo,slamjeez,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:30:44 2015 UTC,"yes. plenty of part out threads with whole motors for sale. depending on where you are as well, junk yards are a great source. most will come with a warranty plan gauranteeing the engine will run with no problems once installed. they usually test these engines before they pull them out in order to be sure it's a good runner. I like to use autohaas in NJ as they come with a 6month warranty."
projectcar,32m8uo,1broknrado,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"Jokes on me, here in Hungary most of the parts get traded through undergroundish Facebook groups usually without any guarantee. It's always 50/50, many has the parts disassembled so you can't even check if it's working. It's not the best environment to start a project. It's in my nature somehow I don't like risk."

projectcar,32m8uo,strategicdeceiver,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:39:19 2015 UTC,Cost breakdown of 94 Miata 12A RX-7 swap:   ~$500 for car Engine was leftover from another project so that was free Transmission was $50. Reused the stock miata center and tailhousing mated to RX-7 bellhousing Sold some random parts off the miata and might have made $50 Random gaskets and parts so far ~$100    Haven't kept all the receipts but I'm pretty sure I haven't spent more than $1000. Didn't take into account tools I've bought along the way because I will always get use out of those on other projects. Still need either a new carburetor or a rebuild. Got lucky and found the intake manifold already had a lot of emissions blocked off but might need to get an OMP block off plate.
projectcar,32m8uo,Joes2silly,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:03:55 2015 UTC,"After selling extra parts off, I'm at less than $500.00, not including the base Durango, which was a daily driver for many years before it became a project.  I found on many things you can trade time and labor for money.  Makes everything harder, but it's coming out of my back, not my wallet."
projectcar,32m8uo,Cephalapodus,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:24:38 2015 UTC,$4200 - $3k on a running/driving 78 camaro and another $1200 on parts to rebuild suspension and steering. Next is brakes and motor...will not be cheap  All in cost will probably between $8-10k minimum when I'm done. And that's without wasting money painting it anything other than flat black primer ;)
projectcar,32m8uo,Meandmybuddyduncan,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"Bought my w123 300D for $1400. I put 600$ in little things here and there (door handles, trim pieces, new grill, lights, etc). I probably am looking at a brake job in the future (front side calipers are in bad shape). I don't plan on fixing the vacuum system any time soon but it's on my list. Also AC for this terrible Florida Summer is on the list as well.  Roughly 2200$ in, have about 1400$ to go for everything else I imagine."
