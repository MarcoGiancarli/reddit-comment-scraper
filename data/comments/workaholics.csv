workaholics,3e3tss,drewsoft,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured they might be some type of rum. I saw some triple sec used as Pawns on a few other sets, which will be a lot easier drinking and price wise. Unlike the Workaholics, I'm trying to have actual chicks over and I do not see having rum for Pawns ending well with dudes, let alone chicks."

It would just feel like a regular IASIP or Workaholics episode with guest features. Which would still be tight but it prolly won't live up to the hype.

Friendship Anniversary was good, so was Brociopath, but that's all I'm going to give that season.  Anders, Blake and Adam came across as total dickheads, rather than the loveable stoners/alcoholics they were in the first 3 seasons.  Even the ""good"" episodes are still shit compared to the good comedy writing we had beforehand. The season opener with Montez's wife was the weakest season opener of the series.   The whole tone wasn't right, you watch the first 3 seasons it feels like Workaholics. Then you watch season 4 and parts of season 5 and it feels like people trying to be the Workaholics.  Just my opinion"

The very last episode is noteworthy, but the rest were kinda ""meh""   Meanwhile, IASIP has been getting better. I thought season 6 was probably sunny's worst so far, but they had some great episodes like the gang buys a boat, mac's big break, and who got dee pregnant?  Then season 7 comes along with half the episodes being some of the greatest TV ever seen, despite a rather weak season ending (imo)  Then 8, 9, and 10 all have fantastic episodes.   I think IASIP guys are just more consistently funny. They are falling victim to stereotypification, where the traits of each are being exaggerated. This happens in all shows after a while, but IASIP has managed to keep it relatively fresh. They just need to make Mac all the way gay and they'd have a whole newpile of stories they can write."

First 3 seasons were fantastic, but season 4 soiled everything, and season 5 was only slightly better than season 4. Lazy writing and lack of care into what you put out equals lack of audience.  As a writer of both television and movies, it's safe to write your entire series before you make a show, and rewrite it repeatedly before even pitching it. Laziness was this show's downfall"
workaholics,3ch9us,JohnFuckingSmith,3,Wed Jul 8 01:36:14 2015 UTC,They really blew it starting with 3B. The show stopped being cool when they started trying to gross everyone out every episode. I still watch it but I don't get excited about it and I don't recommend it to friends anymore.
workaholics,3ch9us,kjuca,2,Tue Jul 7 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"The show had definitely peaked.  First two seasons were great, but everything since then has been pretty lackluster."
workaholics,3ch9us,phillpjay,2,Wed Jul 8 06:53:26 2015 UTC,Has anyone noticed the over-the-top amount of product placement 2 seasons ago? It detracted from the show in my opinion.

Don't get me wrong I expect the show to have weed and be stupid, but I wish the show had more heart and was more dynamic."
workaholics,3ch9us,hokie47,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"They resorted to gross out humor and got hacky, using teenager targeted humor.  Too bad. I really loved the show!"
workaholics,3ch9us,newsdaylaura18,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"I think seasons 1-2 and the first halfish of season 3 was the golden age. Season four had like a 5 episode streak of bad episodes and only maybe 2 episodes that really made me laugh. Season 5 had some forgettable episodes and some gems and I have yet to watch season 6. Terrible product placement turned me off, them spending a lot less time at work (its the name of the show!) turned me off, focusing on pointless stunts instead writing funny material turned me off. It's evident that the guys are masters at impromptu awkward humor but, they are not the most creative comedians.  Saying that, in my opinion a good workaholics episode is the best funny thing to watched stoned tied with Curb your enthusiasm."

Normally the gang could just fly direct but their competitive nature combined with their hatred of The Boys will force them to enact some bizarre plan to make their lives hell.    Frank buys plane tickets, and instructs the rest of The Gang to meet him at the airport.  The Boys attempt to sell burweedos  Mac, Dennis and Charlie steal Dee's car and drive to the airport.  Dennis is distracted by a hot flight attendant  Frank burns down the burweedo shop  Dennis is kicked out of the airport for sexual harassment  Charlie panics at the thought of leaving Philly and calls in a bomb threat  Mac is detained after the bomb threat due to wearing a duster and dark sunglasses  Frank actually burned down a homeless shelter. He is arrested.  The Boys forget about the race and play video games    End result is The Boys don't make any money, Frank is in custody, Dee is stuck in Philly, Dennis and Mac are on a no-fly list and Charlie wanders back to the bar.

workaholics,3an2j6,davbav23,5,Sun Jun 21 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"I feel as if Adam and Mac may have this hilarious sexual tension/attraction  that could be played off well with their love of pumpin' iron and martial arts. Ders and Dennis would definitely try to bang the same chick, possibly ending in Ders trying to get back at Dennis by sleeping with Dee? Which, of course, wouldn't bother Dennis since he couldn't give a fuck anyway about his bird ""whoore"" sister lol. I'm hoping that Charlie and Karl would form a strange friendship that ends when Karl sleeps with the waitress. Frank gets stoned with Blake and they come up with a crazy idea to start a company, which Frank happily invest in. Frank tells him he needs a code name, (Frank's being warthog), so his friends don't find out about his success. Blake chooses the name Mike Bean and ""Gryzzl"", is born! Nobody but Dee makes the flight to Amsterdam amidst the character chaos, but by the time she arrives, estatic about winning and calls to gloat, everything in Philly has blown over and nobodies willing to help her home."

I'll still have John Oliver to carry me until Key and Peele in July, but yeah summer is kind of a dead period for TV, usually.

Yes, two of HBO's biggest series, I've been missing out on for one reason or another."

Key & Peele is too hit or miss for me. I always just watch the popular clips that get put on Reddit. I binged The Wire. As you probably already know from other people, it's good haha."

It's one reason I started watching Breaking Bad once I heard a lot of Seinfeld actors (minor ones) land on BrBa.   I recently heard about The Rock and Ballers, but I forgot about it until you just reminded me. I'll have to get on that one too.   I guess this summer won't be too bad for me after all"

Season one had a rich story with a clear moral and season two saw the rise of opportunities and how they can intervene with one's motives. Season three was a clusterfuck. It was funny but it really felt like another show and to me it was poor. Season four was terrible.

workaholics,31y2gh,NezihBouali,2,Thu Apr 9 20:49:50 2015 UTC,It was when the last commercial break started.
workaholics,31y2gh,Thefuckingknot,38,Thu Apr 9 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, the way Blake delivered his ""I'll have what she's having"" line right before the intro was absolutely hilarious. He was so close to bursting out laughing, it almost looks like he didn't even have a line there or just forgot what it was then remembered last second."
workaholics,31y2gh,jdscarface,13,Thu Apr 9 13:17:00 2015 UTC,I was crying with laughter. His delivery was flawless.
workaholics,31y2gh,dudeman316,5,Thu Apr 9 14:46:15 2015 UTC,He WAS about to burst! hahahaha
workaholics,31y2gh,NezihBouali,4,Thu Apr 9 21:20:25 2015 UTC,That's definitely a contender for best line delivery of the entire series. I laughed for a solid five minutes at that bit.
workaholics,31y2gh,JQuick,2,Tue Apr 21 15:49:33 2015 UTC,He also says it with a southern accent sorta.. perfect

workaholics,31y2gh,dudeman316,5,Thu Apr 9 14:47:16 2015 UTC,"Best moment of the episode, only time I laughed out loud"
workaholics,31y2gh,shadowofahelicopter,39,Fri Apr 10 20:39:05 2015 UTC,I thought Blake and Ders would try to peep Bill's hog there in the bathroom
workaholics,31y2gh,nave_117,37,Thu Apr 9 02:16:30 2015 UTC,Some of the shit they've been doing this season in the office was making me wonder why Alice hasn't fired them. It's kind of nice to see they had a plan
workaholics,31y2gh,nave_117,7,Thu Apr 9 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"The thing I don't get is that their drugs are legal and they weren't eating them in public. In fact they were stolen! So no reason to be fired at all, don't you think?  I like that at the start he said ""what kind of drugs are we testing"". Throwback to the first episode!"
workaholics,31y2gh,NezihBouali,10,Thu Apr 9 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"Their drugs are legal in their house if they have a card which they do from Karl. It may not be illegal to have it in their possession, but it's still against company policy to have it on company property."
workaholics,31y2gh,ItsMilkAndEggsBitch,5,Fri Apr 10 04:02:45 2015 UTC,I figured that when they first got all smarmy about holding a trump card over her it would be the Ders / sex scenario and then they took us back.  AND THEN BOOM.
workaholics,31y2gh,lakerswiz,34,Thu Apr 9 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"I like how Bill does the ""You want to see my junk?...Na"" bit that Adam, Ders, and Blake have all done in earlier episodes."

workaholics,31y2gh,Juls317,2,Thu Apr 9 06:55:54 2015 UTC,"Ratings have been the lowest they've been since the show began and they've declined about 30-40% from the season 4 average, only the season premiere topped 1 Million viewers. For comparative purposes, only 2 episodes in all the other seasons combined rated lower then that.  At that level, they'll get renewed for maybe one more season, with a big maybe."
workaholics,31y2gh,nahcoob,10,Thu Apr 9 11:39:53 2015 UTC,"While you are right, the show is more than just traditional TV ratings. They have a strong Twitter and social media base. Advertisers use this is as another avenue."
workaholics,31y2gh,hokie47,8,Thu Apr 9 13:26:24 2015 UTC,Hopefully its enough to get them over the line - I loved this season compared to S4.
workaholics,31y2gh,nahcoob,2,Thu Apr 9 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"Very true, and I think Workaholics is one of those shows most people aren't watching on traditional TV."

workaholics,31y2gh,WillBlaze,35,Thu Apr 9 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, there were a lot of plot holes.   I think it's strange and wonder why they couldn't use the old office for solidarity..   Alice is punk yet in the episode were they flashback to college days she's very normal looking, and honestly quite beautiful at the end when they walk out.   The Crazy Monday skit reminded me a lot of The Office sketch ""Scranton -What?- the electric city!"" But they have stated their love for The Office before and have also found a few homages before and enjoy everyone.   Also, I'd bang braces Alice.   Loved the Jillian character development/background."

workaholics,31y2gh,BaltimoreRavens123,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:28:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I got that especially when Ders recapped it but I was just saying that it reminded me of The Office.
workaholics,31y2gh,GodKingThoth,9,Thu Apr 9 09:09:45 2015 UTC,"Right, but thats because The Office was parodying the same song"
workaholics,31y2gh,lthej,-21,Thu Apr 9 20:51:05 2015 UTC,THATS FUCKING AWESOME SAY THAT SHIT ONE MORE TIME PLEASE
workaholics,31y2gh,GodKingThoth,5,Thu Apr 9 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"No, I was saying that The Office was parodying Lazy Sunday, as was Workaholics, hence why they are similar. Are you a moron?"
workaholics,31y2gh,lthej,-16,Fri Apr 10 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"By the way, everyone fucking knows it was parodying Lazy Sunday because they said it in the episode, so why would anyone need you to tell us exactly what was said in the episode?"
workaholics,31y2gh,GodKingThoth,10,Fri Apr 10 04:41:33 2015 UTC,You are being very loose butthole right now dude
workaholics,31y2gh,tuwangclan,-18,Fri Apr 10 06:03:19 2015 UTC,And all I was saying was it reminded me of the office so quit being a bitch
workaholics,31y2gh,GodKingThoth,6,Fri Apr 10 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"Haha you are actually a stupid person, I was telling you that the Office was parodying it too, because you seemed to think it was just a coincidence that Electric city sounded like Lazy Sunday."
workaholics,31y2gh,lthej,10,Fri Apr 10 13:06:36 2015 UTC,I do like the connection of Alive being punk with her drum playing a few seasons ago.

Cool to see somebody else thought of it :P Plus there are indeed a lot of plot holes with the old office, how Jillian and Alice started out (considering that College episode) and the reason for them to get fired."
workaholics,31y2gh,NezihBouali,3,Thu Apr 9 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"Also Jillian was with Alice during the collage episode, but she didn't work there?. It seems like a pretty silly plot hole"

workaholics,31y2gh,Just_Ice_Cream,0,Sat Apr 11 09:58:58 2015 UTC,pretty weak overall.  i'm not knocking them.  its a hilarious show. 5 seasons is a lot.
workaholics,31y2gh,booger_sculptor,9,Thu Apr 9 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"I like that at the start he said ""what kind of drugs are we testing"". Throwback to the first episode!  Have you dudes noticed the plot holes? I think they're in the new office.  Plus Jillian and Alice started out differently according to Flashback in the Day. Something else that I don't get is that their drugs are legal and they weren't eating them in public. In fact they were stolen! So no reason to be fired at all, don't you think?"
workaholics,31y2gh,NezihBouali,3,Thu Apr 9 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"It's probably against company policy to brings drugs to work. Doesn't matter if they have cards. If the job says no, it's illegal."
workaholics,31y2gh,yoitsthatoneguy,8,Fri Apr 10 21:03:58 2015 UTC,Loved that they included Jetset in the background of the intro/outro commercial screens.

workaholics,31y2gh,Thefuckingknot,5,Thu Apr 9 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"My main complaint with the whole season. Last season wasn't good but at least the multitude of Karl scenes made up for it. He was hardly in any episodes this season. I guess Kyle directed a lot of the episodes this season, maybe that's why."
workaholics,31y2gh,free-bum-rubs,6,Thu Apr 9 16:55:10 2015 UTC,Kyle did a damn good job directing it though.

workaholics,31yumg,somefuckwho,8,Thu Apr 9 05:40:38 2015 UTC,"Their Twitter made it seem like they plan on a s6, that's all we know right now I think"
workaholics,31yumg,Boymankid,5,Thu Apr 9 06:34:07 2015 UTC,"According to Nielsen ratings, Workaholics was down to .8 Mil viewers average an episode from last seasons 1.25 Mil average. A decline...and I'm not gonna lie, a significant one.  By comparison, Futurama was averaging over 1 mil viewers per episode at the time of its cancelation.  Would this drop in ratings be enough to cancel it? It depends. Futurama was canceled because the show cost over $1mil per episode to produce in relation to the viewers it brought. For comparison, South Park costs Comedy Central roughly $100,000 per episode and generated way more ratings per episode.  It is just a simple return on investment decision.  What is this cost for Workaholics? I don't know.  At the same time, it is one of their most popular shows and in a prime time spot. It has those things going for it.  I don't think this drop is enough to cancel it. If it was on Fox, probably. But we are talking CC here...the company that picked up Futurama when no one else would.  If if makes you feel better, they renewed Drunk History for a third season so..."
workaholics,31yumg,tickleshitz,5,Thu Apr 9 12:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think that it won't ever return to like it is now. I think that at the best it will return with a way lower budget or a different channel or a different time slot.  I think a lower budget could do okay for them though, if the actors stay. They had a lower budget at the start of the show's run and those episodes were kind of more believable and to me, more funny. That said, season 5 was good.  Either way, I hope that that isn't the end. It was a good episode to end on though in my opinion, if it did come to that."
workaholics,31yumg,modernbenoni,2,Thu Apr 9 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"Its also worth noting on their twitter page from 14 hours ago they say, see you next season.  To me, that says they at least are not expecting season 5 to be the last. Whatever the case, they have not been officially canceled as of yet."

workaholics,31yumg,caninehere,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:29:17 2015 UTC,"Drunk History was funny enough as a web series, but the idea to make it a full program was idiotic. I don't know how it's still on the air - and I love a LOT of the people involved with that show."

workaholics,319n6u,buffpriest,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:51:37 2015 UTC,You should check out their stuff on Youtube. I think it on the Mail Order Comedy channel. Some of it is a little meh but you can definitely see them honing their craft. I think my favourite out of their early stuff is the 2 girls 1 cup video.
workaholics,317fwi,sweatycatland,11,Thu Apr 2 16:22:37 2015 UTC,The moment everyone gasped in nervous laughter/horror.
workaholics,317fwi,icosikaitrigon,9,Thu Apr 2 19:12:03 2015 UTC,Was this for shock value or what. It seemed really uncharacteristic of the show.
workaholics,317fwi,CDT6713,10,Thu Apr 2 20:27:55 2015 UTC,These guys were high as fuck when they wrote this episode. I came over to /r/workaholics just to see what the fuck everyone else thought of it.
workaholics,317fwi,I_AM_THE_LIQUEUR,5,Fri Apr 3 01:31:55 2015 UTC,it did seem a little bit dark. They probably just had the hitting joke already and tried to make it work and fit it in somewhere.
workaholics,317fwi,Ancient_Unknown,3,Thu Apr 2 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"I've always enjoyed dark humor, so I was pleasantly surprised when this happened.  I hope they do more of that kind of stuff."

workaholics,317fwi,satansheat,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:44:49 2015 UTC,Another lesson to take away from this is don't look in mirrors when on psychedelics. People who have done stuff like acid and looked at themselves in the mirror will know what I am talking about. It's to intense.
workaholics,317fwi,sunndreams,9,Fri Apr 3 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"this was one of the first things i tried when i did acid, and then shrooms, and its pretty underwhelming."

I actually like looking into the mirror near the beginning of the trip so I can gauge how much I'm tripping, and if I stare at my warping face for 15 minutes, then that's cool too.  Having said that, that's the only part about psychedelics that are underwhelming; watching the movie Heavy Metal on 400-500ug of acid isn't something that should be done by everyone, especially on their first time (which is what I did, but it ended being fucking awesome)."
workaholics,317fwi,EverGreenPLO,0,Sun Apr 5 00:53:02 2015 UTC,Why did they put that scene at the end?   We could have conveyed the same msg fading out with the dad blessing out the kid in front of the guys

workaholics,3164mq,iborobotosis23,13,Thu Apr 2 18:49:48 2015 UTC,The characters most certainly would be Rogan fans.
workaholics,3164mq,colewilco,3,Thu Apr 2 20:22:33 2015 UTC,The characters? Sure. The writing behind the characters? Maybe not so much. It kind of reminded me how they kept throwing around Dr. Pepper 10 and how it was only for men.

workaholics,3164mq,MProsserMMA,3,Thu Apr 2 22:58:11 2015 UTC,He's a snake oil salesmen who peddles pseudo-science to halfwits. And an average comic at best.

workaholics,3164mq,colewilco,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:11:17 2015 UTC,He's the pinnacle because he half discusses topics and says things like  Op's quote  He's a bully at times and remember a MMA/Fear Factor host first  That's why this episode was so fucking great
workaholics,3164mq,EverGreenPLO,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:31:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's hating,  it's a concise statement that makes a good point. joe promotes junk food thoughts, and it's fun to hear sometimes, but it's wacky to take literally, and talk about.

workaholics,318bqa,ZeLingonberry,2,Fri Apr 3 05:24:06 2015 UTC,"He was hilarious, but he was also notorious for being an asshole sometimes in this exact way, searching for faults in everyone's behavior to rant against. This article discusses, with some diplomacy, some of the difficulty people had working with him due to his personality.  I know people like that, they're often hard to be around, but I definitely think those same traits contributed greatly to why he was such a great comic."
workaholics,318bqa,zazie2099,2,Fri Apr 3 06:13:12 2015 UTC,Patrice is like that.   A I recall he ended up saying the workaholics guys were cool dudes.  He just didn't get it.
workaholics,318bqa,IggysGlove,2,Fri Apr 3 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"Patrice clearly just got the wrong impression. They are actually mocking the ""I don't care"" attitude Patrice is talking about. Anders plays a deeply insecure guy who covers it up with a veneer of cockiness and delusion."

Every other show would need the main characters to apologize and take the rap for the breaking the mirrors.

workaholics,3155l1,pure-guava,10,Thu Apr 2 02:23:49 2015 UTC,cocaine? meth? research chemicals? Dmt?
workaholics,3155l1,buffpriest,13,Thu Apr 2 05:02:04 2015 UTC,they did cocaine in the club with 'trick

workaholics,3155l1,iaglia,3,Thu Apr 2 05:07:26 2015 UTC,"idk if i'm spelling this right but dimethyltriptylene. or something like that. DMT is released when you dream (makes them feel real) and when you're dying. When you take it it makes it seem like you're dreaming. Often you have to write down your trip after it ends because you will forget it, as you would forget a dream.  Joe Rogen actually talks about this in trippy detail here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grcqs9cDuN8  edit: I'll leave what I wrote but DMT is actually spelled Dimethyltryptamine. I was close but not really enough."

I don't think comedy central would let them dive into drugs like heroin or meth.   Heroin isn't fun to watch even if you dramatize it like they did with mescaline anyway, you just feel really good and lay around mostly."

workaholics,30wj3u,KWMJ,20,Tue Mar 31 22:50:29 2015 UTC,Chris D'Elia was a little disappointing on the roast. I defs thought Hannibal Burress stole the show.. Martha stewart and natasha leggero were both amazing as well
workaholics,30wj3u,austinbucco,5,Tue Mar 31 16:58:35 2015 UTC,I thought Pete Davidson killed it as well.

workaholics,30wj3u,stackered,-1,Wed Apr 1 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"whatt I have to say Hannibal was the worst, Snoop second worst (being too high/drunk) and everyone else was awesome.  Martha killed it for sure.  I'd say D'Elia was in the middle, but he definitely crossed some lines nobody else did so I give him props there (this is a roast, after all).  Jeff Ross was of course one of the best, and Kevin Hart was a great host and his shit was funny too.  I was expecting the roast to be good based off ripping on Bieber, but it really was great overall.  Still, I'm shocked anyone would rank Hannibal in the top half of performers, but I guess I just don't like his comedy (saw him live, cracked a few smiles at most)."
workaholics,30wj3u,Hizenboig,4,Wed Apr 1 06:45:27 2015 UTC,I think it's Hannibal's laid back style is what I found funny.

workaholics,2zekqq,mellow777,18,Wed Mar 18 08:28:47 2015 UTC,"AV Club has been doing reviews of Workaholics episodes for seasons 3 and onward and one of the common points is how similar yet different the two shows are.  In IASIP the characters are just the downright most selfish, dishonest, most backstabbingest and egotistic people. They're likeable to the audience, but their plans and machinations always fail because of their negative traits. They're united as friends, but any one of them would backstab anyone else for profit. That's why all their plots fail.  In workaholics, the guys are definitely egotistical, but not at all selfish or backstabbing guys. Their plans always fail because while they think they're the greatest ever, they're complete losers. They regularly get outwitted by neighborhood kids. Their ""jokes"" are completely unfunny (see the roast episode), but we get our laughter from the fact that in their minds, they THINK they're the funniest, coolest, most clever, and awesomest crew ever. They sometimes take on a completely obnoxious frat-boy persona that anyone in real life would absolutely hate, but because they're good guys inside we forgive them and it's funny.  Seeing these two types of personality from each show clash together on screen would be absolutely hilarious. I can just imagine some sort of grand plan coming together and completely collapsing from both fronts - the IAS crew ruining it trying to maximize their personal gain, and the workaholics crew ruining it because they're so goofy."
workaholics,2zekqq,1speedbike,17,Wed Mar 18 00:01:58 2015 UTC,"Always Sunny is my favorite show. I love Workaholics too but never realized how similar they are until you pointed this out.  Both crews are more or less ""stuck"" with each other. Anyone who would try and hang out with the gang from Paddy's would think they are either complete psychopaths (true in Dennis' case) or just absolute freaks, like Charlie. Hanging out with the Workaholics crew would be such a strain on your patience you'd probably strangle them or just ditch to try and not hurt their feelings.   Could you imagine Mac and Adam having a karate fight? Which would ultimately result in Mac swinging his arms around making wooshing noises and Adam flexing and looking like he was going to shit himself. I imagine Ders would probably lay his moves on Dee and she'd totally use him for a stupid new car or something (like the goddamn bitch she is) that the gang would crash later. I also see Charlie, Blake, and Frank getting along just fine until someone gets seriously injured and Blake gets sketched out.   Or, they could go the total opposite route and have them all get along swimmingly and just cook up some terrible, half-baked, stupid ass plan that absolutely bottoms out before it gets to phase two. All the while they are pounding beers and finding commonalities in their shared weirdness.  So much potential"
workaholics,2zekqq,KidCasey,7,Wed Mar 18 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"Mac and Adam are even more similar. Just look at the faces both of them make. They are both obsessed with muscle men, and have the worst ideas they have strong convictions about."

workaholics,2zekqq,HBreeder,3,Wed Mar 18 00:53:02 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong here... I'm not saying I wouldn't enjoy this (because I would) but it would have to be a little bit of a stretch since one show takes place in SoCal, and the other in.........Philadelphia. It would be awesome. Although now that I think of it, I could totally see the episode turning out to be the Workaholics crew getting to Philly, to an empty Paddy's, and the Always Sunny crew ending up at an empty frat-bro house in Rancho. That would be some O.Henry ""Gift of the Magi"" shit."
workaholics,2zekqq,drumsmcg,8,Wed Mar 18 01:28:26 2015 UTC,all you need is a 2 min intro explaining a road trip to either location
workaholics,2zekqq,bud1316,6,Wed Mar 18 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly, especially for the iASiP half, it would be super easy. Gang is ""tending"" the bar, and bam the Workaholics guys walk in completely trashed looking for a drink. Or Mac comes in all fired up with them in tow, saying he met them at X place. One line of dialogue saying ""I ran into them at X location, they said they're on a roadtrip"", boom done. Even the Workaholics have would be pretty easy: cold open into the guys as they drive into Phily, as they talk about some sports/drugs/rave they want to go to, cut to the volvo breaking down in front of paddys pubs as they are driving around lost. The setup part is the easy one, it's combining two different ensemble casts seamlessly which would be the difficult part."
workaholics,2zekqq,Vongman,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:30:30 2015 UTC,"Frank, Dee, Charlie, and Dennis are sitting at the bar talking about something useless when Mac busts in with the workaholics crew.   Mac starts talking about how he has news (which they all love) and also new friends to join the crew. At this point dennis and dee are opposed to new blood in the crew, but frank and charlie seem to like the idea.   The plot is that the workaholics guys didnt know they accrued holiday days off while working at TMC, but when they find this out they realize they have capped out the max amount of days off you can earn (at two weeks or a month or something). They decide to take a road trip in the rape/grape/serape van with karl.   and so on"

workaholics,2z5h3x,Jeremy252,13,Sun Mar 15 20:39:31 2015 UTC,season 4 was the worst season of the show as all it was was gross out humor and disgusting shit that wasnt funny.  its been nice to see this season rebound with some actually funny episodes.
workaholics,2z5h3x,bud1316,4,Sun Mar 15 22:17:45 2015 UTC,I dislike that the burweedo episode makes everyone say season 4 is gross and with bad taste.

workaholics,2z5h3x,h0ntor,3,Mon Mar 16 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"I don't get what's wrong with that episode I personally found it to be quite hilarious. Yeah the roadkill bit was gross, but when they hot box the suits and Blake runs into traffic..come on! And they named their place Best Buds, not the mention the old school S' s they use for each S there. This one actually one of my favorite episodes haha a Burweedo...sounds good right!"
workaholics,2z5h3x,Tinsa223,3,Mon Mar 16 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"I think for some people like me the episode was a really bad execution on what was an excellent premise. The guys leaving TAC to work for themselves. Hells to the yea. It just fell soooo flat. I'm not saying there wasn't funny stuff in it. There was just so much wasted potential. Also, the extent that Blake and Adam fuck over Ders, Karl, and themselves seems out of character."
workaholics,2z5h3x,iborobotosis23,3,Thu Apr 2 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, I thought it was funny too. The skunk bit was gross, but everything else was pretty funny. ""Chicken dance...doin the chick-en dance"" lol"
workaholics,2z5h3x,Supbraj,4,Wed Mar 18 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure about what other people's reasonings are, but to me it feels kind of like what happened to Arrested Development: the show didn't evolve.  When I first watched either show, I really dug it because it was a style of humor that seemed really novel.  Unfortunately that style of humor didn't seem to ever really shift.  It seems like it relies on the same sort of gimmicky ""tight-butthole"" jokes, which were funny at first but lost something after a while.  At the end of the day the element of surprise just seems gone, which is obviously a key part of good humor."
workaholics,2z5h3x,Anirak,2,Mon Mar 16 00:33:23 2015 UTC,I think the show almost has a lore of its own it's setup. The show doesn't entirely revolve around their mannerisms.
workaholics,2z5h3x,minetorials79,2,Sun Mar 22 22:50:54 2015 UTC,"I think my rating of the seasons, from best to worst, would go something like this:  2  5  3 (first half)  1  3 (second half)  4  I think what has happened like with most comedy shows is that the creators were the writers in the earlier seasons. They had all the ideas and had more creative control over the show. As it gained popularity more resources from Comedy Central got thrown into the mix. The guys had less to do with the content of the show and focused more on the acting in it.   It also seems like they've gotten less and less improvey in their scenes as the seasons have progressed. The second half of the third season and the entirety of four seems to be the most tight in scripts. That led to less wiggle room for the guys and that je ne sai quoi quality was lost. The show is just becoming more refined, less raw. Fans from the beginning of the show see it slowly changing away from what they fell in love with, and begin to resent it a little bit.  Overall though I think the show is great. There are just some episodes that marred their respective seasons. The standout issues I can remember are what a lot of others mention like the attempt at gross out humour, etc. Also the guys acting not like themselves like in 'Beer Heist'. Their attempt at negging these 19 year old women was just something I don't think they'd do."

workaholics,2yqzfg,xRingo,-9,Thu Mar 12 05:20:07 2015 UTC,Only the ending made me last. Rest of the episode sucked
workaholics,2yqzfg,midgetpooooo,-1,Thu Mar 12 05:23:20 2015 UTC,What hot chick like that would be interested in Adam...and especially in the way the events unfolded? So much cringe.

workaholics,2yqzfg,zaplinaki,2,Thu Mar 12 08:40:50 2015 UTC,I thought it was gonna turn out like the It's always sunny episode where the rich dude asks Dee to a party to make fun of her antics in front of his friends. That would've definitely been less cringy.

workaholics,2x70lr,dnfa666,-7,Thu Feb 26 08:50:58 2015 UTC,"Jack Black was perfect as a Demamp, but I thought it was a little strange that they added in that totally unnecessary  ""I'm actually your brother"" thing.  Seemed to me that Jack just didn't want to be seen as somebody who could have a kid in their mid 20s-early 30s and made them put that in.  Loved the episode and all of their performances, just seemed to me like that part of the script came out of Jack's ego and not out of trying to make the show better."
workaholics,2x70lr,MonkyThrowPoop,3,Thu Feb 26 15:51:01 2015 UTC,"Jack Black is only 14 years older than Adam DeVine in real life, so I think the brother thing coupled with the line about him being 13 when he had him was just them joking about that."

With the stache and the grey Jack could pass for 55ish, Adam reads younger so he could be 27ish.  Their energies and look are so similar that it totally made sense for them to be father/son.  It was perfect casting.  So I think that the reason they added that brother part in is because somebody didn't like the father thing, and I think it was Jack.  I'm not saying it made the episode bad, I loved it, just trying to start some discussion in this discussion thread other than just the normal ""awesome episode!"" stuff."

I just felt like those lines were added to the script later and didn't really add anything to the episode.  I think Jack as the dad is fucking awesome.  He could totally be a one upping, attention hogging dad and it would have been a little bit tighter butthole.  IMHO"

I wouldn't say I don't enjoy surrealist or absurdist humour - there is a difference between that and not making sense.  Even shows that have ""surrealist"" or ""absurdist"" humour operate with an internal logic that the comedy can grow out of.  Not to beat a dead horse, but the problem with the episode was that the steps it took to get to the roadkill-eating gag (which was presented as the highlight/climax/centrepiece of the episode) were incredibly illogical and forced for the sake of the gag."

I might even be able to recommend this show to friends again - though I'll have to tell them to pretend the second 10 episodes of season 3 and all of season 4 don't exist. Then again we have some episodes to go, they have a lot of opportunities to screw everything up again."
workaholics,2w18lq,smackythefrog,2,Tue Feb 17 20:02:43 2015 UTC,The best episode of Workaholics is honestly Real Time.
workaholics,2w18lq,berad90,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:16:12 2015 UTC,Yes it was one of the best and it was in the first half of season 3. I said the second 10 episodes - season 3B.  Actually to be honest though now that I'm looking at what episodes were in 3B there were a lot of good ones in there too. I just remember Booger Nights from 3B being the start of the whole gross-out trend in this show and got it conflated with season 4.
workaholics,2w18lq,ibelieveicanfly420,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:50:19 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time remembering themes of seasons of any show. Be it drama with a continuous story, like Breaking Bad or Shameless, or just episodes that reset all the time like Workaholics or Archer (sort of). It's hard for me to say ""oh season 2 was awesome but 3 sucked but 4 came around.""  I say this because I felt this show's comeback was last season. I felt the first season, which is what got me in to the show, was great. But it fell off a bit somewhere in the middle. I can not pinpoint where, but last year when Season 4 had its fair share of complaints on here, I was scratching my head. Season 4 actually piqued my interest again, but I'm not sure for what reason. Just watching the show didn't seem like a chore, like something I had to do because I had invested a few seasons prior to it so ""I can't turn back now...""  This season is pretty solid as well. I'm not bored. Maybe I need to rewatch the whole series and pay attention to season-by-season changes, but I felt the show's low point was a few years back and not just last year/season."
workaholics,2w18lq,bud1316,1 point,Mon Feb 16 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"The first time I watched the series through, season 4 was a big letdown from the previous seasons for me.  I went through the season a second time just before season 5 started and I actually liked season 4 a lot more, for whatever reason.  Although I love the show as a whole, I still think 4 is the weakest season"

Blake does another wrestling reference shortly after when he crotch chops & says suck it. That's a reference to D-Generation X

workaholics,2u0wp3,AHartmann,8,Thu Jan 29 15:01:06 2015 UTC,These 2 comments just prove how superior season 1&2 are. They are full of memorable quotes and moments whereas especially in season 4 they relied way too much on gross-out/ridiculous middle school humor.
workaholics,2u0wp3,mostdope92,93,Thu Jan 29 18:27:55 2015 UTC,Seasons 1 and 2 were amazing. Season 3 had it's moments. The episode in season 4 where they killed the skunk for the burritos basically made me want to stop watching the show entirely. I think they decided middle schoolers were their niche audience and they have to cater to that demographic to stay on the air and make money. I'm pretty close to calling it quits.
workaholics,2u0wp3,ape_cage,35,Thu Jan 29 00:58:28 2015 UTC,That was the worst episode ever.

workaholics,2u0wp3,djJulioSanchez,35,Thu Jan 29 17:13:26 2015 UTC,I think part of it to is that it's so over the top its almost not believable anymore. First episode of season 5 was alright but getting back to some of the basics would be nice
workaholics,2u0wp3,Pepper-Brooks,27,Thu Jan 29 01:21:15 2015 UTC,"Tonight's episode was pretty weird, but you posted this four hours ago.. Did you really not enjoy Front-yard wrestling? Adam's slim jim intro and Catam absolutely slayed me."
workaholics,2u0wp3,antperspirant,5,Thu Jan 29 04:30:02 2015 UTC,Catam was amazing
workaholics,2u0wp3,motivate18,16,Thu Jan 29 15:53:35 2015 UTC,I personally find Season 5 great so far.

workaholics,2u0wp3,Auxtin,9,Thu Jan 29 01:59:43 2015 UTC,Same here. Had pretty much no hopes coming in to season 5 since I really didn't like season 4 very much. Been fairly pleasantly surprised with how season 5 has been going.
workaholics,2u0wp3,free-bum-rubs,26,Thu Jan 29 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"Meh, personally I think all seasons have been good for different reasons. The first two seasons both had really good writing and ideas for episodes. However, it wasn't as good technically, especially the sound. The third season had a lot of hits and a few misses. The fourth season also had a lot of hits and a few misses, but the misses were terrible. For me, it's a bit too early to judge the 5th season.   They all still have great chemistry interacting with each other, which is what makes it seem like such a good show to me."
workaholics,2u0wp3,mostdope92,5,Thu Jan 29 01:40:32 2015 UTC,If you're judging a comedy show on technicalities like sound you're in the wrong genre.
workaholics,2u0wp3,Mikeocktopus,5,Thu Jan 29 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you here. The writing and storylines were great but the sound could have been better? Really? Isn't writing and storylines what should be focused on? Thats why I didn't really like season 4, it didn't seem to contain a lot of smart writing, it seemed to focus too much on gross-out/""OMG thats so ridiculously dumb its hilarious"" middle school style of humor."
workaholics,2u0wp3,MetalFury,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"Well I mean they kinda started out like a Harold and kumar for tv drugs comedy realism, but their morrow is let's get weird and that's kinda what they've stayed true to even if not everyone is into it it's what they do and it is hit and miss. They're in everything and making money now and I think that this season is better and they will go bak to the season 1-2 format but if they don't as long as they keep it weird I can't fault them."

Seasons 3 and 4 have maybe 3 episodes each that we still watch and so far all episodes of Season 5 have been pretty ""meh."" The wrestling one last week probably being one of the worst I've seen of theirs. I think Broad City has taken the top spot as my favorite CC show now. That show is great."
workaholics,2u0wp3,CB_Chans,2,Thu Jan 29 12:11:26 2015 UTC,Broad City is great.  The promos for the pilot had me thinking it would be almost like Amy Schumer style humor and crappy sketches but it's totally gotten me addicted.

workaholics,2tx2y9,camjam980,1 point,Wed Jan 28 03:26:56 2015 UTC,There seems to be a reasonable demand for it. I wonder if that'll inspire a reprint.
workaholics,2tx2y9,satansheat,2,Wed Jan 28 03:38:02 2015 UTC,Doubt it. Normally small business won't do this so people have something not many have. If his clothing line becomes a mega hit then he might reprint old shirts from the past. But judging that blake wore a lot of altamont and other skateboarding brands before he got he's own clothing line he probably will follow in similar directions. Altamont is big now but when they first got started reprinting stuff was not a thing. But once they got big enough now reprints are a thing.   I say this because most clothes I wear I can't get another one if I rip it or stain it. But I like that because I get comments on my shirts a lot and I normally never see anyone else with the same shirt. I had 3 shirts blake wore from the first couple seasons from altamont. Also check out beloved shirts if your into his style of clothes. It's not the same and it's not his stuff but it's odd wacky shirts that I could see him wearing.

workaholics,2t8qgo,free-bum-rubs,13,Thu Jan 22 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"Well, when it cut to the first commercial break the guy said ""this episode is brought to you by slim jim"", so I'm assuming they sponsored the episode. Also, their advertising really sucks (check this shit out), but I do still see ads occasionally."
workaholics,2t8qgo,Mybrainmelts,0,Thu Jan 22 04:25:18 2015 UTC,theirs sucks? Cheetos and the Skittles commericals are much worse.
workaholics,2t8qgo,OG_Pow,3,Thu Jan 22 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"To each his own, I think both of those company's ads are downright hilarious."
workaholics,2t8qgo,theJFKshow,10,Thu Jan 22 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"They absolutely paid to be in this episode. Carl's Jr., Jack Links, SK Energy, and Dodge are among others who've had blatant product placement in recent Workaholics episodes.   I understand taking the money and usually they write decent jokes to work the products into the script, so I'm not really mad about it."
workaholics,2t8qgo,MuffinMopper,5,Thu Jan 22 19:17:32 2015 UTC,Slim Jim:  Its like a rope made of grease and plastic!
workaholics,2t8qgo,SimplicityDemand,4,Thu Jan 22 07:09:43 2015 UTC,"Damn they REALLY went in with these two first episodes. This one was even better than last week, episode got stronger and stronger all the way through."
workaholics,2t8qgo,yourmomsbitch,2,Thu Jan 22 18:43:27 2015 UTC,Can someone tell me what tee shirt Blake was wearing when they were watching their public access show? It looked like the 7-11 logo upside down and it said lurkers on it..
workaholics,2t8qgo,shaganfdc,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:15:23 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's from a clothing company called lurk hard or sonething along the lines of that
workaholics,2t8qgo,bajothehedgehog,2,Wed Jan 28 14:27:24 2015 UTC,So much for taking it easy on the product placement this season. A slim jim commercial less than one minute after Adam's walkout.
workaholics,2t8qgo,Solo_and_Chewy,45,Thu Jan 22 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"I thought it was kinda clever because, Randy Savage was known to do slim Jim commercials."
workaholics,2t8qgo,Cottagebouy,6,Thu Jan 22 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"I actually thought it was just a Macho Man Rip off, thats what I thought Ders' copyright concerns were abut"
workaholics,2t8qgo,MuffinMopper,6,Thu Jan 22 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"I actually thought that was the funniest part of the episode.  I was watching it alone, and it was the only part I laughed out loud during."
workaholics,2t8qgo,growlin_bowels,37,Thu Jan 22 07:09:08 2015 UTC,As long as it doesn't detract from the show...get that paper son
workaholics,2t8qgo,pookface1190,-9,Thu Jan 22 03:14:00 2015 UTC,Yea I know that was really lame
workaholics,2t8qgo,flareon64,-1,Thu Jan 22 03:10:00 2015 UTC,As much as I love Ben Stiller he couldn't save this episode for me. For some reason I just simply did not care for this episode..Anyone feel the same?
workaholics,2t8qgo,bajothehedgehog,-1,Thu Jan 22 03:32:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I was very psyched for the premise but the execution just fell flat. It just felt short and void of any solid jokes. I think a better episode idea would have been to have Ranchomania be this big finale tournament with Waymond, Montez, Karl, Jillian, etc. as their own wrestling personas. Never thought I'd see the day where I laughed more at the first five minutes of Broad City than an entire episode of Workaholics."
workaholics,2t8qgo,flareon64,-4,Thu Jan 22 03:45:06 2015 UTC,The moment Broad City started and I actually laughed I felt relieved. I have been on my laptop while watching the episode but even with being a bit distracted the episode hardly had much content that I barely missed anything. I just didn't laugh. I felt like they tried to hard to be funny and I agree that there weren't many solid jokes. I just felt like they were being stupid and throwing shit around.:/
workaholics,2t8qgo,Cheeny,0,Thu Jan 22 03:55:42 2015 UTC,"Despite the downvotes you're getting, I agree. I felt they were trying too hard and I barely ever feel that with this show. Disappointing after what I felt was a great first episode this season."
workaholics,2t8qgo,SimplicityDemand,0,Thu Jan 22 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"Can't say i agree with the trying too hard part. The guys actually did try to make some amateur wrestling, before they got famous, which made it a lot more fun to me. This is likely how they would have legitimately tried to do a wrestling show if they had funds back in the day."
workaholics,2t8qgo,madlate,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:46:54 2015 UTC,Where can I watch the new episode?
workaholics,2t8qgo,JackTurkeyDinosaur,2,Thu Jan 22 18:07:42 2015 UTC,http://www.thevideo.me/bn8it5je9i3n
workaholics,2t8qgo,madlate,1 point,Fri Jan 23 21:05:10 2015 UTC,my man! thanks
workaholics,2t8qgo,KingBR1,-1,Fri Jan 23 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"Wasn't too fond of this episode. The plot didn't go anywhere interesting, the wrestling scenes were kind of cringeworthy and not that funny, and it just seemed like they were trying too hard. I want more episodes where the plot keeps you guessing, and events seem almost random as they play out."
workaholics,2t8qgo,Katanae,14,Thu Jan 22 07:52:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're watching the wrong show, bro."
workaholics,2t8qgo,AlexEmway,2,Thu Jan 22 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought the first episode was actually brilliant. By the end of it, all three of their actions inadvertently lead them to the porn dorm, and I thought that was some pretty decent writing.  But this episode didn't really make me laugh. Stiller was under-utilized and it certainly felt rushed."
workaholics,2t8qgo,KingBR1,0,Sun Jan 25 22:16:54 2015 UTC,Pretty much sums up how I felt as well.
workaholics,2t8qgo,cregger,0,Mon Jan 26 00:49:24 2015 UTC,then make your own show bro
workaholics,2t8qgo,KingBR1,-1,Thu Jan 29 03:56:51 2015 UTC,This really added to  the discussion.
workaholics,2t8qgo,cregger,0,Thu Jan 29 07:30:04 2015 UTC,and sarcasm is really funny
workaholics,2t8qgo,BadNewsBrown,-6,Thu Jan 29 21:49:33 2015 UTC,"This episode was fucking stupid.  What did Eskimofo do, that led to the screwjob finish and Adam getting the win?  Fuckin bullshit and I'm never watching this show again."
workaholics,2t8qgo,victor018,5,Fri Jan 23 13:04:18 2015 UTC,typical Eskimofo marks getting worked lol
workaholics,2t8qgo,The-Juggernaut,-3,Fri Jan 23 22:07:42 2015 UTC,"After this episode I officially hate Adam. Ders understands how the world works, Blake is immature but alright, Adam is grating, out of the loop, and a punk bitch. Eskimofo shoulda won"
workaholics,2t8qgo,jenacious,8,Thu Jan 22 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"Adam is grating, out of the loop, and a punk bitch.   He's always been these things.  When has Adam ever been calm, totally understanding of whats going on around him and a pleasant person to be around?     Either you've only caught a couple of episodes or you are as dense as he is."
workaholics,2t8qgo,The-Juggernaut,0,Fri Jan 23 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"No he's always been annoying, but I've never wanted to reach through my screen and hit him before. Seen every episode"
