n64,3e53qp,randomaccnet,3,Wed Jul 22 00:53:27 2015 UTC,I've had this on my list of games to play and review for the past year and I still haven't gotten to it.
n64,3e4ckk,eastcoastbarista,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"Does it happen with all games? The most common culprit of picture issues is actually game contacts that are dirty. You can clean them with a Q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol. While I'm not sure that's the issue here, it's always the right place to start.  Does the game continue to play when it goes fuzzy or does it freeze? I had a console with a defective/loose power cord and periodically it would freeze and the screen would look all jumbled. But if the game continues to play then it wouldn't be that."
n64,3e4ckk,n64answer,2,Tue Jul 21 21:33:28 2015 UTC,I had a similar issue before- my problem was resolved by cleaning out the A/V port on the system itself.
n64,3e4ckk,theladydisarray,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"I had this problem too, turns out it was because i had it plugged in a battery backup and it was causing feedback. try plugging the power directly to the wall."
n64,3e4ckk,Danake,2,Wed Jul 22 00:44:56 2015 UTC,Blow into it
n64,3e3uk0,stylishseven,4,Tue Jul 21 19:19:05 2015 UTC,That ice key took so much of my time trying to get that thing. Good video!
n64,3e3uk0,Jcpowers3,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"Right? That among all the other items hidden within Banjo Kazooie, most of which I had no idea even existed. I believe the Ice Key was most notorious because it was the only item that taunted you, whereas a lot of the others were hidden in areas that you couldn't directly see. It drove me nuts!"
n64,3e3uk0,crazeguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"Hey guys - just thought I'd chime in and say I had a lot of fun  revisiting these topics while making this video. I'd love to hear if you also shared similar experiences, or if you had your own N64 rumors that you tackled in your younger years. It's always interesting to hear what others have to say on the topic, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts!"

n64,3dycut,DoTheRustle,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:54 2015 UTC,Reminds me of metroid prime from the gamecube in a way. GFG of course is much more cartoony. It's pretty fun though. You'll probably enjoy it once you get around to it (if you ever do).
n64,3dycut,kingnickolas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:46 2015 UTC,"i remember renting this game.  I thought the single player sucked, however that game has a great multiplayer from what i remember."
n64,3dycut,steak1986,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:50 2015 UTC,Really? That surprises me. I thought exploring in that game was really fun and mysterious in the single player.
n64,3dycut,1790shadow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:28 2015 UTC,The game would be 10/10 if it wasn't for the obnoxious collectathon at the end. I don't know why they made it a requirement to get every single Tribal. Should have been 80% of the total or something.
n64,3dvs6i,Savestate,6,Sun Jul 19 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"Good on you mate, really impressive. Shame there isn't a bigger homebrew scene for the N64."
n64,3dvs6i,dashn64,5,Sun Jul 19 23:07:49 2015 UTC,There's been some slow and steady progress it looks like in the development tools. Hopefully there will be more in the future!

n64,3dvs6i,15h0uldbew0rking,4,Mon Jul 20 10:13:01 2015 UTC,"Cool! Developing for (or more likely porting to) the N64 is definitely on my to-do list.  I'm pretty keen on having a go at all the classic consoles/computers, when time allows. Thus far I've managed TRS-80 Model 4, Microbee, TRS-80 Color Computer 3 (aka Coco 3) and Neo Geo with Amiga and Sega Genesis in the works."
n64,3dvs6i,TotesMessenger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"Dang dude, you're on a roll! Programming for those systems are probably a magnitude or two more complex than programming for the 64. Given how relatively similar programming for the N64 is to writing C for a standard desktop operating system, I'm surprised at how little people have done it."
n64,3dvs6i,juef,2,Mon Jul 20 03:02:08 2015 UTC,"On the Neo Geo I've got one project in-progress I'm writing in 68K assembler, but the other project on it that is all-but-finished was written in C, using the rather primitive 'devkit' (little more than a header and a few thin C routines) released by Neobitz before they realised they could make money writing games and not giving away their development libraries. Not really all that complicated in C, to be honest. The 68K stuff required some low-level R&D on my part though.  One of the contractors that I had working for me recently did a stint in a gaming house writing N64 stuff back in the day, though it was a start-up that never got published. I still keep in touch and intend to pick his brains once I work out a suitable project for the N64. I'll probably tackle a 2D title first, then try my hand at 3D. The N64 is one of my favourite retro systems (have several at home) so can't wait to give it a go!"

n64,3dvs6i,crashnburn254,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:22 2015 UTC,Very nice! Have you tried it on real hardware or Cen64? How much C code does this game amount to?
n64,3dvs6i,themanoftin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"I've tried it in Cen64 and it seems to be working... I want to try it on real hardware but I left my Dr V64 at my parents house last time I was visiting and forgot to bring it back with me. As for the C code, Approx 300 lines, but if I went through and tried to optimize/minimize it, it'd probably amount to 100-150 or so."
n64,3dvs6i,teuchito,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! Looking forward to seeing more from you :)"
n64,3dx2vp,themanoftin,3,Mon Jul 20 06:35:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make any difference if the cartridge is opened or not. Check all the traces, clean them carefully but firmly with a q-tip and isopropyl alcohol (or rubbing alcohol) until the q-tip stays clean. You will need a few q-tips.  If this doesn't fix it, open the cartridge completely (you can get the driver on ebay cheap) and take a look on the inside. If you can't see anything the cart might be busted. Take some pics for us  of the condition of the pins at the bottom."
n64,3dx2vp,dashn64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:54:34 2015 UTC,"dashn64 is right, the plastic part of the cartridge is just to make the game look nice, it doesn't matter if it's cracked or missing entirely. All that matters is the pins/contacts. Maybe whatever caused the bottom tabs to break also caused some damage to the contacts."
n64,3dwmll,JackalAbacus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:54 2015 UTC,I keep getting the no screen issue all the time! I think some of the connections inside the console have gotten old and need replacing/repairing...but I can force it to work by repeatedly turning it off and on and messing with the plug and taking out and putting in the game. Eventually.
n64,3dwmll,CarolineJohnson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:48:25 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue with my system. Start with removing and reseating the jumper/expansion pak. Do this 2-3 times if it doesn't work the first time. Replace the pak if it still doesn't work.   If that doesn't work, clean or replace the cartridge slot."
n64,3dwmll,TheTitanX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:41:52 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend cleaning the games. Clean a game's contacts thoroughly with a Q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol then try it again. If the games don't work after being cleaned, it's likely the console."
n64,3dwmll,n64answer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:09 2015 UTC,I did clean them though. It also wasn't working with my buddy's games. Could it be the jumper pak? I plan on upgrading to the expansion anyway so it might be worth a try.
n64,3dwmll,n64answer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"Given that the console had freezing issues before and now it's just not working at all, and you've ruled out dirty cartridges, honestly it's probably just easiest to get a new console. The going price on Craigslist near me for a console by itself is around $20-25 (obviously it goes up the more stuff that's bundled with it, but you could just sell that stuff if you didn't want it). I suspect you'll spend more than $20 trying to fix a defective console. That's just my suspicion though, based on what others have said in response to similar questions.  You could get an expansion pak and see if that fixes it first, and you wouldn't be out anything because you can use the expansion pak for your replacement console if you go that route."
n64,3dwmll,im_too_HM02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"It could be the jumper pak making a poor connection, or it could be the power supply. Are you using a third party one, or is it official?"

n64,3dssjr,awt1998,9,Sun Jul 19 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"It's an awesome game!  A lot of people get turned off from it due to the fact that it has a little bit more of a ""learning curve"" than MK64, making it harder to pick it up and play multiplayer with random people.    I think it's fantastic though!  It actually provides a challenge, and is fair in doing so.  Beating each course is only the first challenge!  Getting all the silver coins, unlocking the secret world, beating it in reverse, and unlocking T.T. are all difficult, but very fair.  Perfect combination for a game in my opinion!    Congrats on the new game!  What other ones did you purchase?"
n64,3dssjr,cjgerik,3,Sun Jul 19 02:58:14 2015 UTC,"The other games I got were Lego Racers, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, and Bio Freaks. Lego Racers seems lacking compared to DKR and MK64 but it's ok. Bio Freaks is an interesting fighting game but it's fun and unique. I haven't played much of Turok because I need a controller pak to save and I don't want to keep playing the whole game over whenever I turn it off. From the small amount I've played it seems like an ok fps."

n64,3dssjr,JoshuaPearce,2,Sun Jul 19 04:49:28 2015 UTC,I'm amazed nintendo hasn't made a sequel yet.
n64,3dssjr,cjgerik,3,Sun Jul 19 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"Well, it was a Rare game, so that's probably why :/ I'm hoping eventually people will be able to crack the code and make fanmade rom-hack sequels to it!"
n64,3dssjr,JoshuaPearce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:42:44 2015 UTC,"We've had donkey kong sequels, and even a DS remake of this game. So it's still a bit odd."
n64,3dssjr,cjgerik,3,Sun Jul 19 03:54:26 2015 UTC,"Well Nintendo still owns Donkey Kong even though they don't own Rare (odd, I know), so that explains why they've had sequels of those games. And as far as a remake of a game goes, I'm not sure what that entails as far as the different business parties are concerned, but it seems like it would be a lot easier to come to an agreement over remaking a game than having Rare give permission to Nintendo to create a new DKR game.   I'd love to see a new one, but at this point it just doesn't seem likely :/"
n64,3dssjr,trashedputin,2,Sun Jul 19 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"I assume Nintendo owns the IP since they were making games with DK on NES, and allowed or commissioned Rare to make more Donkey Kong games."
n64,3dssjr,Steelix93,2,Sun Jul 19 12:43:24 2015 UTC,"They made one for the DS, but IMO it was not as great as the first."
n64,3dssjr,n64answer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:37:26 2015 UTC,"So glad to see someone enjoying the game. This has always been one of my favorite games on the system, but I've always been the only one I know who likes it more than Mario Kart.   As an aside, were you looking to buy Pokemon Stadium 1 or 2? Because $35 is way overpriced for 1 (and probably well-priced for 2). So if you're looking for Pokemon Stadium 1, I'd recommend just picking up a copy on eBay - they go for about $12."
n64,3dssjr,pappy511,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"I was looking for Pokemon stadium 1 but apparently the one I saw at the store was the 2nd game after looking up the cartridges. Looking back at it I think the 1st one was there too but I only noticed the 2nd one, leading me to believe it's the 1st one that cost more than I remembered leading me to getting DKR. I guess it was a happy accident because I don't regret buying DKR."
n64,3dtj1s,themanoftin,20,Sun Jul 19 08:44:29 2015 UTC,Who is this prophet you speak of?
n64,3dtj1s,BrokkkolliSalaaad,4,Sun Jul 19 13:40:19 2015 UTC,"There are still tons of games for $10 or less, and many of them are awesome. The earthbounds or conkers are not the majority of available games.  It's a hell of a lot cheaper to be an N64 collector now than it was in 1997. And a lot easier too. I enjoy knowing I have some expensive games in my collection, but the ones I enjoy buying are the cheap ones."
n64,3dtj1s,JoshuaPearce,3,Sun Jul 19 11:48:07 2015 UTC,This gets overlooked all the time. I didn't blink at buying Splatoon for $85 with an amiibo. Just because prices have gone up on lots of games doesn't change the fact that even the top tier games for most retro systems are well below original retail.
n64,3dtj1s,northernswagger,2,Sun Jul 19 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"I think another problem is younger people tend to have this attitude that all games should eventually become bargain bin prices because that's what tends to happen to Xbox and Playstation games from 6th gen onwards. While all games do lose value over time historically Nintendo titles are the ones that retain the most value, and in some cases even exceed original MSRP. Take the GameCube for instance. You'll have to put down about $35 for Mario Sunshine which is still much cheaper than the $50 it cost at launch. Whereas Halo can be obtained for for dirt cheap, and third party games are even cheaper. Since the other two console manufactures have a much greater library of third party games people become used to games eventually being dirt cheap. This has never been the case with Nintendo because they rarely ever discount prices. Nintendo consoles are the most popular systems to collect for, and they retain their value well. This leads to frustration when you compare them to even the third party games during that same time period, and even more frustrating for someone who is just starting as a Nintendo game collector."
n64,3dtj1s,miniboss1487,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"There's also the factor of the consumer market for games being about 10 times as big now, compared to 20 years ago. There are a hell of a lot more copies of newer games floating around, and people are a lot less likely to throw out a box of games as junk."
n64,3dtj1s,JoshuaPearce,2,Sun Jul 19 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"No, not really. I would gladly pay full price for some of these games because they are just that good. I've held onto a few games from my childhood and picked up a few others and I can tell you right now that $25 for Super Mario 64 is a bargain. You're going to get one of the greatest games of all time that will last you forever if you properly take care of it. Besides, the games that go for outrageous prices like Earthbound are few and far between. Personally, I don't bother with those games there are still plenty more to play and at pretty good prices. Here's a list of my recent N64 purchases.  Kirby 64: $22  F-Zero X: $15  Blast Corps: $10  Banjo Kazooie: $22  Cruisin World: $5  Paper Mario: $40  Smash Bros: $50  Only two of those games were pricey. And you know what I think they are both worth every penny. I've already sunk a good 20 hours into Paper Mario and have had a few Smash Bros parties with my friends. It sucks that certain titles like Conker have been taken over resellers but part of the joy in collecting is hunting for deals, going thrifting or garage sale hunting, etc."
n64,3dtj1s,miniboss1487,2,Sun Jul 19 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"I don't share these sentiments, since basically what you're complaining about is supply and demand. If there's a game that's very rare (low supply) or that people really want (high demand), then the price will be higher - it's that simple. I don't really know what you mean by ""corrupting the value of games"". Earthbound's going price of around $200 isn't ""corrupt"" - it's just a product of the relative supply (it sold fewer copies than many other games) and demand (many people want the game because it's become a classic).   I also disagree that the bids on games like Earthbound are only from resellers. First off, just because bids are high for a game doesn't mean there isn't a collector or individual out there bidding that amount because he or she really wants the game. You can't tell just from seeing a game go for a certain price that it went to a reseller vs. a collector. Second, eBay isn't a great place to buy games to turn around and resell for a profit, since eBay approximates the market value of the game, so to make a profit you'd have to mark it up above what people are generally willing to pay. Finally, while retro games have increased in recent years, it's not like they're stocks - their values generally don't swing wildly week to week. So I would disagree that someone buying Conker for $80 today is doing so just so he can sell it when it jumps for some reason to $120 next month.  Would it be nice if everything were cheaper? Yes. But that's not really how the market works. As mentioned on here, there are still many games that aren't $40-50+ that are great, and there are other solutions like the Everdrive that render this entire problem moot."
n64,3dtj1s,n64answer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:42:07 2015 UTC,I don't. It's par for the course. The N64 is rapidly approaching 20 years of age and the price of those final game cartridges ever made is only going to increase because there are still people who buy them at that rate.
n64,3dtj1s,rkwittem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:38:32 2015 UTC,"If you just want to play the games on real hardware, not necessarily collect them, I think a flash cart like the EverDrive 64 is a worthwhile investment."

n64,3dtj1s,repeat-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"As far as re sellers who scoop up everything in the area then sell it for ridiculous prices yes i dislike them a lot.   Yes, it sucks that the prices are going up but you have to remember this is a 20 year old console. Games break/ get damaged etc. There will only be less and less of them. Especially since a lot of people who grew up into the 90's now have a stable income and want to relive there childhood. So there will be competition for the finite items.  My suggestion is to ask on fb see if any of your friends dont want there childhood collection anymore and buy it. Thats what i did and buy the rest that you want slowly.   You can always get a Everdrive 64 and play that way. Plus you can always be patient and jump on good deals for the real carts when you see them."
n64,3ds75a,GhettoSnail,3,Sat Jul 18 23:12:54 2015 UTC,Would $60 CAD be about $45 USD? The Canadian dollar is shite right now. That doesn't seem like an awful price if you don't need to pay for shipping...
n64,3ds75a,momentumlost,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:30:39 2015 UTC,You know it's actually more expensive to get it off eBay. Worst case scenario on eBay is $60 American and best case scenario it's $45 American which is what you are being offered now. I say get your deal.   EDIT: Lol downvotes? The math check out. $60 Canadian is $45 American which would be the cheapest he could possibly get on eBay.

n64,3dkyxz,snarekicksnare,10,Fri Jul 17 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"Because people will pay it.  If someone wants to get back into playing N64 or anything else retro, the first titles they are going for are the Mario titles, Zelda titles, Metroid titles, etc.  My local game stores will charge twice the Price Chart value of Super Mario 3 on nes, and they have no problem selling it at $30 because people will pay it to play a classic game they remember so well.  Nintendo's properties will usually have a premium price because they know people will pay extra for it, even if it isn't rare or uncommon.  Just my thoughts."
n64,3dkyxz,HeyCoach3885,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:01:37 2015 UTC,"Were the titles common, yes. But everyone who has them, are keeping them and people who gave away their collections in their youth are coming back in big numbers to re-experience their beloved childhood memories. I had an extra copy of Smash Bros a couple months ago that I sold on craigslist in just 2 days for $60. It does seem to be harder to come by the Mario Party titles. I haven't looked up the numbers on sales, but my suspicion has been that the Party titles were more popular Blockbuster rentals than for people to buy. Especially seems harder to come across #3.  Lots of 1 and 2. (lots when comparing to finding #3 that is)"

n64,3dkyxz,doodbro86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"Because of popularity of the game. For example as more Mario Party titles come out, we thirst for the originals even more because the new ones 'aren't the same'. Which I get. But you're not wrong in saying they have sold the most on the system (best selling game on the N64, Super Mario 64, goes for around $30 where I live (Canada)). It's because of how popular they are."

I think some others touched on this in the comments, but there seems to be a decrease in supply along with the increase in demand.   Do the carts generally still work? For example, if you had a lot of ten games, would you assume they'd all still work, or are we so far out that you'd only assume eight would work? I haven't heard any conversation about that yet."
n64,3dkyxz,paperandcloth,2,Fri Jul 17 22:51:20 2015 UTC,I have only come across one cart that I could not get to work. Carts are easy to take care of and hard to truly break.

Maybe it's like De Beers and someone's hoarding. Or maybe every single 30-35 year-old is now completely invested in reclaiming their childhoods, which I think someone else previously suggested. I'm going with the De Beers hypothesis.   I'm actually interested in this. I would have thought most carts would decrease in price, due to their availability on virtual console or emulator."

n64,3dkyxz,miniboss1487,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what answer you're looking for? It's demand plain and simple. People who own the games already are usually not willing to sell and buyers right now are willing to pay those prices. There's really no other way to explain it. Nintendo games, especially those N64 games are regarded as some of the best games ever made. If you're interested in retro games you are going to want to play the best, and that comes at a price."
n64,3dkyxz,n64answer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"1) You've kind of answered your own question: it's all about demand. People want to play Mario titles because they were some of the best on the system. You yourself want the Mario titles so badly you've gotten worked up about the prices enough to make a reddit post! Sure, lots of people had Mario Kart - but lots of people also want to play Mario Kart. Super Smash Brothers isn't rare; it's just in very high demand because people want to play it. There's really nothing more to it.  2) Not exactly on topic, but your comment about local store pricing is exactly why I recommend people just buy on eBay. Think about it - eBay is the best place to approximate supply and demand. eBay basically tells you what price you can get a game for. So all those retailers and stores? They acquire their games at eBay-ish prices, so to make a profit they have to mark it up. So just go eBay, unless you're willing to invest the time in craigslist/garage sales."

However, I know I've personally sold several bundles of Nintendo 64 items (e.g. console plus controllers and games) on eBay to JJGames, which they then take and resell on their site for higher prices.  I'd be curious to learn though about the other ways they acquire their vintage games at lower prices, as I'm sure there are a lot of ways I don't know about."

I definitely see how a lot of thrift shops and retail locations have people come in and sell them stuff, but that's not an option for the many online-only resellers. And do you know where and how they buy this stuff in bulk? I've definitely seen craigslist postings by someone selling a box of games for $X, but they're pretty rare. I'm just curious about other avenues they use."
n64,3dkyxz,Bon03,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:52 2015 UTC,"The guy I know travels from Ohio-Texas on road trips and has a ton of contacts. He'll find a local seller that has a good amount of stuff and throw down an immediate large sum of money ($500-5k) and just buy out their stock. its hard to say no to cash like that. He knows what things are selling for, so he tries to buy things for a 1/3 of what he'll sell them for. Game shops are constantly going out of business and the community can be very tight knit if you do not burn bridges. He's bought a years worth of inventory twice this year from places going under. Once again, for a fraction of what they are worth, but for a large sum of cash."

I'm very good friends with one of his regional managers and so if they need some extra hands, sometimes I'll get a call and get paid in N64 games.   Along with his 7 stores, he also sells stuff online. Things that don't sell in stores, such as no-case disks or trashed stickers, sell very quickly online for pretty much the same price.   He just took a trip to Japan and bought up a lot of Japanese merchandise, but I haven't been close to any of the stores to see how that aspect of the business is doing."

For the base color I used Duplicolor perfect match cans from autozone. They come at double the price, for twice as less paint then the typical spray can, but the paint is much more durable, I only gave them a light clear coat because of how durable it is. Since the paint is designed to go on cars afterall. And for a clear coat, I used modge podge cLear matte acrylic. It's like 5 or 6 bucks at Walmart and it works really well with the Duplicolor paints.

n64,3dgofj,jijipopo,3,Thu Jul 16 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"In most useful order:   The N64 doesn't support component video, without a very difficult and moderately costly mod. S-video is theoretically twice as good as composite (4 wires vs 2), and is noticeably better (if you get cords that aren't faking s-video support by converting the component signal). The console requires a special type of screwdriver bit called gamebit or torx. A good set is $10, a cheap set is $5. Don't try ""the pen trick"", it can glue the screws in place. Compressed air will never damage the console, go nuts. (You were probably thinking of the warning against using your breath, since that can get spit into the machine) You can buy replacement thumbsticks, that's the only option. Be careful not to buy one meant for third party controllers. Best way to get N64 game deals is being patient and shopping around in person. Second best way is to see if the japanese version of the game is playable by english speakers, and get it on ebay. They'll often be 1/4 the price. They'll run perfectly on a US console with an easy and free mod. Jumper packs have no value, in any condition. Most people replace them with a memory pack, which you'll want to buy if you find one. (You'll know the difference because the memory packs have a big red plastic top, instead of that sticker) Reset button is probably dirty, but that's a new problem to me. It's pretty useless anyways. Don't repaint controllers unless you get advice from somebody very experienced with what type of paint to use. Most paints I've tried will make a mess when your warm sweaty hands are in contact with them for long periods, even months after drying."

n64,3dgofj,BCProgramming,2,Thu Jul 16 04:10:12 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting proposition.  I think it is helpful to consider the technical details of why S-Video is superior, then we can try to apply that on an economic factor, and see which one creates a cheaper cord.  Composite effectively works by modulating the color information right onto the Luma information, in a lower frequency subcarrier. Effectively the Yellow cable is two pins- a ground, and the video signal, which, again, contains ""two"" different signals, with one being modulated onto the other. This is of course why it is not considered particularly great, since that modulation tends to introduce video issues (color bleed, jitter, and various other issues)  S-Video has four pins- two ground pins and two signal pins, with the Chroma and Luma being given their own dedicated wires, rather than being submodulated. As a result this gives a superior display.  In the case of the N64, The multi-out/AV connector outputs Composite Video, modulated within the console itself, from Pin 9. This is, of course, the pin that is effectively connected directly to the yellow wire.  Now, often it is suggested, as it has been here, that cheaper S-Video cables will basically use the Composite Video signal and ""route it"" to the S-Video. I don't think this would actually be cheaper. To do so, it would require that the Composite signal have the chroma demodulated, and then sent to the S-Video Chroma pin. It seems to me that this is a bit more involved than merely connecting the S-video pins to pin 7 and 8 on the Multi-Out connector.  Further, it is possible to verify this using a Multimeter. I have an S-Video SNES/N64/etc. Multi-out cable which was some cheap thing like the one mentioned. I'm able to verify there is continuity between Pin 7 and 8 and the appropriate pin on the S-Video, which indicates that the signal from the system is being routed properly, and that there is no ""composite through S-Video"" magic going on; I suspect that no S-Video cord actually does this, because, again- it's just not economical. cheap, crappy stuff would try to do things in the cheapest way possible, and demodulating Chroma and Luma information from composite via an integrated circuit is going to be more expensive than simply running a wire from point A to Point B."
n64,3dgofj,JoshuaPearce,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:06:22 2015 UTC,"Composite to svideo converters are a disposably cheap component. I think despite being more complicated as a design, the savings from needing less copper for the wires would make it more economical.  Though you could be right, and the gain in performance from high end cables is probably more likely from having shielding and perhaps better quality wire."
n64,3dgofj,BCProgramming,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"Composite to svideo converters are a disposably cheap component.   But whether they are disposably cheaper than the copper wire, would be the important question. I do not think the manufacturing cost of an added demodulating integrated circuit- small as they would be- would out-economize a straight-up copper wire. I'm not even sure if being able to convert Composite to S-Video would really remove the need for a wire, Unless the proposition is that the composite Video signal is connected and brought forward to the junction point where all the other cords separate, and that is where the demodulation occurs to create the S-Video signal. That is possible, as many of them do have those little cylindrical boxes there which could likely contain such a circuit.  That said, None of the S-Video cable's I've had/seen- regardless of whether they were super-cheapo or not- have not been continuous between the S-Video Luma and Chroma pins on the AV plug and the S-Video Luma and Chroma pins on the S-Video connector, though. I'd be interested to hear if anybody has encountered any such plug so we can properly shame them as that would be a good indicator that they are modulating the S-Video signal, as obviously I haven't tested every single one in the world.  I'd be more apt to attribute worse image quality with cheaper cables to a lack of shielding between the signal cables in the wire resulting in interference issues, which generally makes it look even worse than demodulated composite anyway."

n64,3dgofj,JoshuaPearce,2,Thu Jul 16 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Like the other responder said, those cables tend to be faking svideo, because real svideo requires more wires, so it's more expensive to manufacture.

n64,3df21l,BrokkkolliSalaaad,3,Wed Jul 15 19:55:11 2015 UTC,The second one is way better.
n64,3df21l,BANGAndTheDirtIsGone,2,Wed Jul 15 21:17:30 2015 UTC,That's good to know. I'll have to keep an eye out. The only ones I've seen on eBay with the box and manual was around £100 for a PAL version.

He overestimates condition when he sells, and underestimates when he buys. Could get all four on eBay in Australia for £1200 no problem."
n64,3df21l,john78901,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree. While the original was fresh and different, the sequel feels rushed and limited. Diddy Kong Racing raised the bar for this type of game. The developers of SBK2 obviously took inspiration from it, but only superficial aspects like the character selection screen and introducing some cut scenes for a flimsy storyline that seems tacked on.  Compared to the original there are less tracks, even while the graphics are technically of a similar level, the artwork and music are of a lesser quality. Some of the music is just the same as the original with some instruments changed, making music sound off. The shooting game only had one course where the original had three, and shooting newspapers is way less fun that shooting snowmen (Paperboy was a much better newspaper delivery game).  There are more items, weapons, unlockable characters and special boards. The best addition are the boss races, which were copied from DKR. The game is just not better than the original, mostly more of the same, slightly better in some small ways, but worse in other ways."

Apparently, if you don't do this step manually you could have problems with the game save data.

I hyped it up saying it was just as good if not better than Mario Kart and they were going to love it.  I kid you not less than 20 seconds into our first multiplayer game one of them somehow flips his kart over and gets stuck in the map and can't do anything.  They immediately declare that this games stinks, turn it off, and put Mario Kart back in.  I wasn't allowed to suggest games after that incident.

n64,3d5gcz,greenriver572,4,Tue Jul 14 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Here's the story. I was on a short trip to visit family and decided to check Craigslist to see if there were any good N64 deals. This one caught my eye and I opened it up. I initially saw Goldeneye and Banjo-Kazooie and thought I should at least jump on them for $5. Then I noticed the subtitle under Clay Fighter and my heart started racing.   My initial thought was that this was some kind of scam, but I did a reverse image search and no hits came up, so this wasn't someone who just grabbed a photo from the internet - it appeared to be real.   Unfortunately the story doesn't have a great ending. I emailed him multiple times from multiple email addresses but got no response. The listing remained active for a few days and was even renewed after I emailed, but it was just deleted an hour ago. I assume that means someone bought it, but I have no idea why the poster would have left the post up so long and even renewed it after selling it.   Anyone seen anything like this before? It seems like something fishy's going on, but I don't really know what the scam would be if there is one. It could just be that someone got the Craigslist deal of a lifetime."
n64,3d5gcz,lordpizzapop,2,Mon Jul 13 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"Could be that the pic is his O.C., or he found a pic online and changed it enough so that it doesn't pop up in reverse image search, and he did this just to mess up someone's inbox."

n64,3d75xm,pc14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:33:08 2015 UTC,"Watch out for some suggestions online; nostalgia makes fools out of all of us. You probably know all the 1st party titles so ill recommend my hidden gem list. Road Rash 64 a great game to play with the buddies drunk especially because of the simplicity and mindless violence. No Mercy considered one of the best wrestling games of all time ; I love it and i hate wrestling. San Fran Rush 2049 is a must have, makes the rest of the race games on the n64 look like trash. Underrated platformers that come to mind are Robot rocket on wheels and space station silicon valley although the n64 has enough platforms as is. But both were actually challenging and interesting and not unoriginal collectathons  Some quirky japanese games like Mischeif Makers, Goemens Adventure. (DK64!ugh). Ogre battle, Paper Mario and harvest moon are hard to find but worth getting for they are the only respectable rpgs on the system. The first animal crossing can be imported from japan. Battletanx Global Assault is a good mp game. Fighting force is a mindless run and fight game similar to hack and slash games like gauntlet legends but fighting games on n64 are subpar. Hydrothunder is often  overlooked water boat racing game like 2049 with better ports out there though. Snowboard kids is a mario kart klone that is somewhat rare and good. Killer instinct gold is arguably the best fighter on the system along with mk4. Cant go wrong with tony hawk either. Some expensive n64 games are pricey because they were so bad that small print cycles happened and drove their prices up now but these games are NOT worth getting despite their $ making you think they are good games ( Carmageddon, Batman, Megaman, Bomberman second attack). There are a lot cheap n64 games worth getting too like excitebike, wave race, 1080, nfl blitz, hangtime, star wars, world driving championship,turok 2. Small but a satisfying for collection for the 40 to 60 worthwhile games. All rareware games of course. Conkers is my favorite game on the system and is a must have. Rare makes a complete satire out of all their n64 platformers in this edgy original platforming/fps comedy. It was pretty much their last last laugh at nintendo before the n64 got discontinued and they were bought out by microsoft."

n64,3d4byv,rQaBabaca,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"I think people are too harsh on Mission Impossible, and it's unjustly called a bad game. You have to take into consideration what was going on at the time. First person shooters on home consoles was all the new rage, with Goldeneye being a giant hit, as well as Turok, and computer FPS' following the wave, such as Doom 64 and Quake 64. When MI came out, people were not interested in a third person shooter, especially one that required more stealth and ammo control, rather than a run-and-gun. I think the game was very innovative, and did a great job portraying the source material of the movie well. The controls may not be the best, but looking back at any shooter on the N64, you could say the same thing. I'd give it another shot"

The cheaper alternative is a composite to hdmi converter from eBay or Amazon. They work, but they can introduce input lag and quality degradation.

Therefore you need a memory pak which allows you to start a new file and play the game fresh.  If it can be done in that game, others should allow it too, although I never personally tried it with OoT."
n64,3ctqcu,SpaceJockey1979,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:22:05 2015 UTC,You can erase the Blast Corps save... Hold start when you power the N64 on and the option to delete the cart data will appear.
n64,3ctqcu,miniboss1487,3,Sun Jul 12 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"There's no way to transfer your save aside from dumping the data yourself off the cart. Which requires extensive EE background and the datasheet on the SRAM save chip.. which may not exist online, which means you'd have to reverse engineer the chip to determine the pin-out and yeaaah. You'd be better off trying to cure cancer"

n64,3cp61w,DevTSinclair,7,Thu Jul 9 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"It's an incredible track, and more effective than the original, but compression isn't the only factor here, there are definitely some different\added instruments. There's more vibrato in the synth leads, and for instance, that swirling background sound that enters at 0:22 isn't in the N64 version. I think Grant Kirkhope mentioned that he needed to do all sorts of cuts and resampling to fit them on the cart. It's so rich sounding and full on in this version! Thanks for sharing :)"

n64,3cn0h0,VictorTheGuitarNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:49:17 2015 UTC,"Most of all, I aimed to be in full health and armour by the time I had to protect her. That means all I had to worry about was protecting her rather than worrying about myself dying all the time. I stood facing her back, against the middle panel of glass. Then I'd just look left and right constantly, making it a priority to kill the guys who are shooting at Natalya rather than me. This took heaps and heaps of attempts so maybe I could have done it better (a user above mentioned using mines) but it worked out in the end."

The way I did it was I took the cap of the spray can bottle, I normally use spray paint for all my projectors since I don't have a spray gun yet, and I sprayed some paint into the edge of the cap. And I flick the can towards the project, thus creating a splat effect. I'll find the link and edit the message in a bit.

n64,3cjm8a,toxic_joe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:38:22 2015 UTC,Doing well! Once you get the other titles you mentioned you can start looking into a lot more of the niche n64 games that aren't as well known but still awesome.
n64,3cjm8a,rQaBabaca,2,Wed Jul 8 12:50:36 2015 UTC,My local shop had Silicon Valley. Any good?  What other niche games do you recommend?
n64,3cjm8a,Oh_Riginal,2,Wed Jul 8 12:53:55 2015 UTC,"Space Station Silicon Valley is an awesome puzzle game. Definitely recommend it. I would also recommend Rayman 2, Blast Corps, Wave Race, Spider-Man, or Body Harvest. Among many others of course, but those are just some of my favorites.  I'll link you to a sight that lists 100 great n64 games for you to look through. It also has lists for other retro consoles. it has not been updated in upwards of a year but its still a good sight: http://www.retro-sanctuary.com/Top-100-N64-Games.html  Have Fun!"
n64,3cjm8a,miniboss1487,2,Wed Jul 8 13:18:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely get Jet Force Gemini. Criminally underrated game. It's a great third person shooter/adventure game, with lots of interesting weapons and three playable characters.   I'd also recommend Pokemon Snap, as it has very unique gameplay, and is fun for anyone who's a fan of the Pokemon franchise (specifically Gen 1).   Lastly, while not usually a fan of sports games, I'd recommend NFL Blitz (any of them). They are outrageously fun, and make for a great time when playing with friends."
n64,3cjm8a,AnonymousTripper,2,Wed Jul 8 14:23:51 2015 UTC,Jet force Gemini will forever remain one of my favourite games. It handles the exploration and shooting elements phenomenally and also has some quirks that will always make it stand out to me as being special.  Definitely get it.
n64,3cjm8a,bayharbor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:01:52 2015 UTC,Silicon Valley crashes if you play it with the expansion pack. Just FYI.

n64,3cjm8a,wiebow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:17:24 2015 UTC,Maybe look into the Star Wars series. Pod racer is one of my favorites and it's one of cheapest.
n64,3cjm8a,stuffekarl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:26:13 2015 UTC,"Great start to the collection. You have a lot of the big must-haves there.  My suggestions are Diddy Kong Racing, Star Wars Episode I Racer, Pokemon Snap, and Jet Force Gemini. They are all relatively cheap and hold up pretty impressively compared to most N64 titles.   Yeah, and like you said, you should definitely get Smash."

n64,3ckx7g,mcflannelman,3,Wed Jul 8 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Some games have an internal battery, and it will erase the save files if the battery dies (SSB and OoT have this). However, DK64 doesn't have an internal battery. I've had this happen before, but the save files came back the next time I booted the game. Try cleaning the contacts and trying the game again."

n64,3ckx7g,pixiestix88,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:15:46 2015 UTC,Ah thank you i didnt know OOT had a battery. What is it used for?
n64,3ckx7g,half_ginger_price,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"Saving, my guess is that there's so many items and events to keep track of that it needs the battery to maintain the file. A good comparison is Majora's mask. Since MM only had to save unlocking items, getting masks and defeating bosses (since you could only save by going back in time, or semi permanently with an owl statue), it doesn't have a battery."
n64,3ckx7g,pixiestix88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:38:47 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Good to know about OOT. I just got mine from GS so i think the battery should be okay but i might pop it open to be sure (got the bits). Glad to see MM doesnt have a battery.

n64,3cl8tj,suga_kislove,3,Wed Jul 8 19:56:18 2015 UTC,Ebay is safe and you'll find the best deals. I personally like amazon better. Jjgames and dkoldies are cool but the prices are usually higher then the first two mentioned
n64,3cl8tj,Manfromtheforest,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:35:27 2015 UTC,"eBay and Amazon is safest. Both will back up their sellers, particularly eBay. If you buy from them, and there's an issue (e.g. the game doesn't work or the seller never ships), it's very easy to get a full refund back. eBay also has the added benefit of reflecting true market prices - other resellers (like JJGames, etc.) will be at or higher than eBay because they have to make their own profit."
n64,3cl8tj,n64answer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:15:12 2015 UTC,I like lukiegames. The games may be pricier than ebay but since you can buy multiple games from the same vendor you end up spending a lot less on shipping. Also they have a points system that's gotten me NFL Blitz and both the tony hawk games for free.
n64,3cf6hk,quilldog52,3,Tue Jul 7 13:03:09 2015 UTC,Was it an extension cord or was it part of the controller? All I see on Ebay are 6 foot extension cords.
n64,3cf6hk,mandlar,3,Tue Jul 7 13:15:33 2015 UTC,"Nope it is all one cord. It is literally 100 feet, it takes be 2 minutes to roll it back up.   Edit: It has been awhile since I looked at it. But it is unusually long."

n64,3cf6hk,st1tchy,3,Tue Jul 7 14:54:41 2015 UTC,There must have been some serious input lag?
n64,3cf6hk,Teller8,2,Tue Jul 7 16:38:39 2015 UTC,Why? Data travels at the speed of light.
n64,3cf6hk,st1tchy,3,Tue Jul 7 16:42:01 2015 UTC,Through fiber optic cables... yeah
n64,3cf6hk,st1tchy,3,Tue Jul 7 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"I get that it is not exactly the speed of light through copper wires, but for this purpose, it might as well. Nobody notices nano-second lag.   Edit: Also, input lag is caused by the devices that process the data, not the transmission line carrying the data signal."
n64,3cf6hk,st1tchy,2,Tue Jul 7 16:50:57 2015 UTC,"My guess is a custom cord. Took the old one out, put in 100' and reattached the ends."
n64,3cf6hk,st1tchy,2,Tue Jul 7 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"It is not 100', I kind of went overboard with that. It feels like 100 when you roll it up! lol"
n64,3cf6hk,st1tchy,3,Tue Jul 7 18:34:04 2015 UTC,Haha I would still put my money on a custom cord.

n64,3cfp2u,Convento,2,Wed Jul 8 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Jeopardy is also a 3 player game if I'm not mistaken. Once again, it's due to the constraints of the source material (TV show).   As for the length of the game, you kind of get what you pay for. Wheel of Fortune doesn't have return contestants like Jeopardy, so you're in for one game, and you're out. A season mode would sort of be weird in my opinion. It's obvious from playing this game as well how phoned in it was, so I'm not surprised there wasn't more effort to put in any bonus or mini games. Overall though, it is like you're on the show... only in 64 bits."

n64,3ci295,NGeX,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"IDK if this is a normal thing but something similar has happened to my NES. You need to understand hwo the N64 works to solve this issue. Basically what going on between the cart and the system is a connection between two metal connectors. Over time its normal for them to erode. With that being said with my NES I purchased a new 32 pin connector, replaced the old one, and noticed a huge performance increase. I am not sure this is the issue with you but it might be time to look into replacing the pin connector in your n64. Other options include cleaning your cartridges with a dry Q tip (I only use Isopropyl alcohol if nothing else works) to remove the dust that may be sitting on the pins. If that doesn't work try a little bit of isopropyl alcohol."
n64,3ci295,Convento,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:26:58 2015 UTC,"Very likely the games' contacts need to be cleaned. Best way is to take the cartridge apart and clean them, but you can also just use a Q-tip dipped in WD-40 or isopropyl alcohol. I highly suspect if you clean your games they'll perform a lot more consistently."

You really just remove the back half of the controller which is held on by seven phillips head screws, with two more hiding in controller pak slot.  Once you're inside you just have three more screws to remove the old joystick assembly, but be careful at this step as the z-button is clipped to the back of the joystick assembly.  after that you just replace the part and reassemble."
n64,3ccxil,jimyt666,2,Mon Jul 6 23:42:55 2015 UTC,"Did it feel or operate any differently than the original N64 joystick? For example, is it more or less sensitive? Does the different size/shape make it any harder to use?"
n64,3ccxil,MyNizzleGary,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"It feels a lot better in your hand for one, it is extremely smooth.  It is very responsive, but if you have been playing the N64 since it came out it only takes a few seconds to get used to, almost like getting a new controller back in the day.  Your thumb is positioned maybe marginally lower than a traditional joystick.  My first reaction to it was genuinely how good it felt, it feels like how it should have been all along."

At the time the internet was blindly trusted and secrets were posted without being vetted or having videos to prove things.   I read at that time on the internet, Probably early 97, that if you finish super Mario 64 in a single sitting and collect all 120 stars WITHOUT saving, when you finish the game there will be a scene where the characters are having a party.  So I did just that. Played it all day. Got all stars. Didn't save. (Which is hard when save is the default after every star)  And was sorely sorely disappointed.  I felt dumb and learned that day that the internet lies."

n64,3c6y7v,SolidmidNA,6,Mon Jul 6 22:23:19 2015 UTC,One of my worst was playing Pokemon Stadium with my friend. He hated that Mewtwo was so powerful and had pretty much no counter in gen 1. We agreed that neither of us would use Mewtwo but when he wasn't looking I chose Mewtwo and he started to cry. I ended up making his whole team faint and said he could use Mewtwo next time. Good times. But my worst N64 moment was throwing it away because I didn't think I'd play it again. I ended up buying a new one years later but it doesn't change the fact that I was a dumb child.

I started saving up for a another copy and my parents surprised me with a replacement they found at a garage sale. It had all the cups beaten too so in glad I didn't have to do that again!  The worst though was losing all my data in my 100% complete copy of Pokemon Stadium. I went to the photo mode part of the game and took some pictures I wanted to print at blockbuster. When I quit photo mode the game started saving, and saving... and saving.... Yup the game froze while saving in the only part of the game that needed to load data. I had no choice but to shut the console off. As expected on rebooting the alt title screen was gone and all my data was gone too. I don't think I ever played the game again."

WWF No Mercy had way more moves and attires compared to the games that released before it, so I'd sometimes spend up to 2 hours just creating one person. So after spending so much time on just creating 3 wrestlers based on me and my nephews, I called them into the room to play and we had a blast. We go to play the next day though, only to find out all the data had erased. So I went through the creation process again and a few days later it'd all delete again. There was some bug or something in the game that would keep on deleting all data. I even tried renting the game from Blockbuster Video and switching their cart with mine, but the bug affected their cartridge too. I later learned that you can backup the custom wrestlers to a memory card, which did save some time, but there was no saving the story mode progress and unlockable items."

Wiz pig 2, and the Dragon have me nightmares!   Banjo Kazooie, Grunty was a pretty tough boss fight especially without using the Cheato codes.   Pokemon Stadium, the Master Ball Prime Cup in Round 2 where the final trainer has a completely stacked team that includes Mew. Round 2 Mewtwo with amnesia was also nearly impossible.   Perfect Dark on Perfect Agent, and Goldeneye on 00 Agent were very hard to beat. In particular the mission in Goldeneye where you gotta protect Natalia using the computer made me rage so hard.   The Gyorg boss fight in Majora's Mask was very hard if you didn't cheese it with the infinite magic potion.   Wrestlemania 2000, any WWF Champion title shot you got in a cage match was impossible. And then if you happen to lose the Royal Rumble which was tough because you had to survive 29 wrestlers, Vince would strip you of the title and you would easily have lost hours of playtime if you were trying to get Shawn Michaels since you needed to either win or defend the title successfully at Wrestlemania.   F Zero X on higher difficulties, good luck!"

They are nifty to have and cool to bring out if you play a lot with buds.  But the joystick is set low in the controller and  does get the same feel and response as the original. But still better than the knock off controller from the original factory
n64,3c5rii,TacoKingBean,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"To note is that it seems it's better for certain games, primarily due to the button layout, and the smaller, more compact design of the controller. Because of this, and I guess the limited release outside of Japan (I don't know really, I was born in the 90s but didn't ""live"" in them), and because of the better design and whatnot, the price is justifiable.

You could also use a GameCube controller on the Wii to play N64 virtual console games. Either that, or you could look into running Homebrew on your Wii and use the N64 emulator available online.  I also don't believe it's possible to replace the c-buttons with a joystick on the n64 controller. You may be able to find a 3rd party controller online somewhere, but I haven't seen one."

n64,3bzzv2,n64answer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"I created a FAQ just for this purpose, you can find it here. It was originally a sticky, but the game of the month posts displaced it, and now it's just in the sidebar, where no one sees it. I feel the same way as you - I know the sub isn't that active, but I feel like a FAQ is a good way to address the most common recurring post topics (e.g. ""How do I get started?""). However, I might be in the minority, as any time I post a link to the FAQ I get downvoted (see below).  The way I look at it, I'm not trying to direct people to a FAQ just to cut down on posts on the sub - I'm trying to give people a one-stop shop for all the information they need to get introduced to the N64. If someone creates a post saying ""What do I need to get started with the N64?"", people might post that you need a console, controllers, etc, but a full FAQ would answer questions they might not even know they had or might introduce them to things that they didn't know about (e.g. introduce them to the idea of the Everdrive)."
n64,3bzzv2,cjgerik,0,Sat Jul 4 01:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with mocranks, the sub isn't active enough to need an FAQ or a sticky thread.    Additionally, I've found that things like that are often detrimental in cases like these.  If I was to want to buy a Sega Genesis, a game system I have never had and really don't know all *that* much  about, being redirected towards an FAQ/Stickied post would discourage me from wanting to buy it.  There's something about having other people help you personally that is extremely helpful and inviting.    Plus, each user's preferences are different.  Sure, you can search google and find out the reviews and ratings of every single game, but hearing about one user's favorite memory of a game, or best moment during their first playthrough, may be the difference between a the newbie buying a game or not.    You simply can't beat ""human-to-human"" interaction when teaching people about a new subject."

n64,3bwmm0,RingAnswerHello,5,Thu Jul 2 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"The reason it's rating is so much lower is that it's a port with no improvements yet on a better console that came out 3 years after the original release.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Legends_%28video_game%29#Reception  Edit To be clear, the improvements that were made weren't seen to be substantial.

I think Mission Impossible didn't get a fair chance, as everyone was raving about 1st person shooters at the time. Games like Goldeneye, Turok, even ports of Doom and Quake were the norm. A third person shooter like Mission Impossible just stood out from the crowd. It also wasn't a straight forward run and gun game, like most of the others on the console at the time. You had to be more stealthy and strategic. While other games such as Metal Gear Solid did this concept, Mission Impossible was unfortunately not as polished. But I still think it does a good job in executing its goal, which is to represent the movie. Of course, the graphics don't hold up today at all, but I think the gameplay does to an extent.

At the beginning of the game, in Kokiri Forest, you're blocked from exiting into Hyrule Field by a guy who moves with you so you can't pass him, until you get the sword and shield. Go right up to this guy, then you gently lift the left side of the Zelda cartridge up out of the console (lift slowly and only until the glitch happens; if you pull too much the game will reset). If you do it correctly, the game glitches and you slide right past the guy and you now have access to Hyrule Field (and surrounding areas) without getting the sword and shield.

Video game forums were in their infancy, and a ton of gamers turned to them to find secrets and stuff. As a kid I must have spent HOURS running through Hyrule and trying to reach unreachable areas in the game. It was during this time that a lot of glitches used in speedruns were discovered. Today it's pretty well known that the Triforce doesn't exist in OoT, but back then it was magical to believe in it, and search for it based on speculation, and outright lies that were spread on forums back then. I don't think we'll ever experience anything quite as special as the triforce hunt again. That's why to me it's my ""White Whale."" You have no idea how badly kids wanted to be the one who discovered the triforce. If you want a glimpse of how dedicated people were at searching for the triforce check out this classic fan site, scroll down to the triforce rumors section. http://www.odysseyofhyrule.com/"

n64,3bqzs6,miniboss1487,2,Wed Jul 1 21:11:02 2015 UTC,Well that's the thing. To a lot of people back then hunting for the Triforce was a bigger adventure than the main game itself!
n64,3bqzs6,jimyt666,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:13:51 2015 UTC,There's also the different versions of the game and dev copies. If memory serves they went into a rom and there is a triforce room made or something. Shigeru a few years ago was saying how not everything has been found in OOT. I think it's there someplace somehow

At the time (when I was a kid) I thought I couldn't kill any guards because that'd trigger the alarm. (Later I found out you can kill the guards)  So I ended up beating the mission by getting the exact timing of the guards patrols down and beat the entire mission without firing a shot. Super difficult but possible.   That is my white whale."

When I was a kid I remember hearing from someone or reading (probably in Game Informer; this was before the internet was big) that you could get to the roof of the castle without getting 120 stars and that Yoshi would be there. You had to do some kind of special sequence of jumps to get up there. I remember hearing this and going straight to my N64 and trying for hours to do it but never got close. Even today, when I boot up SM64, I still give it at least a shot or two.  Nowadays I would just pull up a YouTube tutorial on how to do it, but that wasn't around when I was a kid. I just looked it up and it seems like there's still dispute over whether it's possible, how it's done, and what's actually up there."

On the right side of the castle, there's the mountainous slope that leads to and hits the wall of the castle.  If you triple jump in the right area, you will get enough height to where you can angle to the left, dive, and grab onto an invisible wall.  When you stand up, you can then get to the castle.    I'll look for a video showing it, I'll post back here once I do.  [video]  But yes, it is very much possible!

In BK, then, there would be the Ice Key and some cool new stuff. It would also involve that island in the distance in the beach level. They scrapped the feature during development, at least partially due to a revamp in the system where instead of having a decent amount of time, users would have less than a second before the RAM cleared and the stuff was lost. People talked about it forever, but there was no way to actually do it. There are a bunch of references to it, and I think even some implementation of it, on the Xbox 360 game BK Nuts and Bolts, but I didn't really enjoy that game so I never got around to it"

Blast Corps is an awesome action game where you pilot multiple vehicles/machines to clear a way for a Nuclear-bomb-truck stuck on a course back to ground zero by destroying cities and what not :)  EDIT: Banjo Tooie still has the worlds you enter, its ""hub"" just happens to be a big open world with actual things to do."
n64,3brcdl,Cheddartot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:33:17 2015 UTC,that sounds really cool. The blurb for Banjo Tooie that you just gave me wouldnt be out of place with modern games.

n64,3brcdl,MegaWatts86,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:32 2015 UTC,"It plays pretty differently, but it's still quite good, and there are still a few people who play it competitively. It's pretty easy to get into, and it doesn't have a few of the things that the later ones have, but it's really balanced and quite fun.

n64,3bqmp1,tmshrt,4,Wed Jul 1 10:40:07 2015 UTC,I'd start off by cleaning the games and the console. You can clean the console by using a credit card and then folding a paper towel around it along with a bit of rubbing alcohol. For the games you can use a qtip and rubbing alcohol.

n64,3bqmp1,n64answer,2,Fri Jul 3 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"The first step should be cleaning the games, as that's the most common culprit and is a lot easier than cleaning the console. To clean the cartridges, you can use a Q-tip dipped in either WD-40 or isopropyl alcohol; I typically use both, WD-40 first then alcohol. The best way to clean them is to take the cartridges apart and use an eraser, followed by the Q-tips, but you'd have to acquire the special screwdriver for it.  If that doesn't work, then I'd find YouTube videos on how to take apart and clean the console."
n64,3bqmp1,mzupeman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:03:56 2015 UTC,"Glad the cleaning worked, man.   That's the problem with most things in the retro gaming realm. And it can mostly be cleaned with a q tip and alcohol! :)"

After playing hundreds of hours of Mario Kart Wii / 8 I can't play the older ones....   Any Mario Party. I think we have 1 and 3. Super Smash Bros  The New Tetris or something like that. It's only 2 player though. Mom and I still play it regularly 10 years later. Pokemon Stadium 2. Mini games and battles are pretty fun. We really liked playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 together. It was 2 player in a HORSE mode. Where one player goes and gets a score then the other goes and has to beat them, back and forth until someone gets a lower score than the max and they get a letter.   That's all I can think of. Most of the N64 games I've played lately were 1 player games."

n64,3bmyn6,rickroy37,5,Tue Jun 30 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"Star Fox has long toyed with controlling different vehicles, and the upcoming Wii U game is going that route too.  I always thought it would be cool if you could control each of the characters.  Imagine if each ship had different armor abilities, different lasers, and different maneuverability.  It would add a lot of replay value to the single player campaign.  They could explain a lot by making Slippy's ship the worst.  If they really wanted to take it to the next level, have each character's ship fly along different ""rails"", so that one level plays 4 different ways depending on which character you pick.  Maybe even make it so you can team up 4 player in the campaign mode?  I'm just dreaming now."

n64,3bjlgf,LiarInGlass,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:15:40 2015 UTC,"The fixed is way rarer because, like grey turok, it was only given to those who called about the glitch (the didn't advertise the free fixed games very much for obvious reasons). IIRC the difference is that the original has in small white text on the front ""100-USA"" and the fixed version has ""100-USA-1"". The first three number might be different, the USA-1 I remember though."

I've never experienced the glitch because I hear the biggest trigger for it was using a CAW in the single player story mode. I hear they didn't completely fix the problem with the rerelease it just happens far less frequently. I could be wrong it's been so long since I was on GameFaqs trying to figure out the source of the glitch with so many other users haha. If it wasn't for that bug and cut wrestler intros, I'd probably rate No Mercy higher than Wrestlemania 2000."

n64,3bcx5r,Creature_73L,3,Sun Jun 28 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty inexpensive stick to try out yourself, and a lot of people recommend it so it may be something people want to try. That being said it does have it's own flaws, and I'm not sure if I (along with the others with my exact complaints) just received faulty sticks or not, but I'm fairly certain that everyone is just ignoring their own issues.    I will start by saying this stick physically feels amazing, and it is much sturdier than the original, and I doubt it will wear down anywhere near as quickly. Like the original stick, it does have a plastic top, so it is prone to slipping like the original, it is not rubbery like a gamecube control stick, so don't get the wrong impression, the ""gamecube"" style comes from the way the stick sits in the controller itself.    The physical properties of this stick are great, and I love it in that way to death, but that being said it does have performance issues. Most people, even those who find no issue with the way the stick behaves, will admit that it has sensitivity issues. When you tilt the stick just barely in Mario 64, you're at a full sprint almost every time. This makes aiming in first person games like goldeneye and perfect dark extremely difficult and imprecise. Eventually you can get used to this, but it's still a chore at certain times.    The thing that kills the replacement stick for me is it's range of motion. Imagine you're playing Mario 64 once again with original the control stick, and its ability to move in a full circle, 360 degrees. You point the stick straight forward, and Mario takes off. You slowly turn the stick to the right, and Mario turns his body slowly as you hit certain certain degrees around the circle, making him move and turn smoothly. With the GameCube stick, as you move Mario your controller his about 3/4 of the original intended articulation points, making the movement, again, difficult and imprecise. In the beginning you may not be able to tell the difference, but it's there, and it is much harder to make Mario move in a straight line when trying to move diagonally (you'll be wobbling back and forth trying to keep him straight).    There are other alternatives, as well as a fix for the GameCube styled stick. If you are capable of messing around with the insides of the replacement stick, there is a new chip you can buy and solder into it. After finishing that and calibrating it, it will be much less sensitive and full range of motion will be restored. This is preferable if you're able to do it, and you absolutely must play with an original n64 controller.    Another alternative is 3rd party controllers, my favorite being the hori mini pad. This thing is ridiculously expensive though, but it is as close to a functional GameCube controller for the n64 as you will get (in fact, some believe Nintendo modeled their GameCube controller after the hori mini pad). It's a bit small, but it fits perfectly in my hands and I love the thing, so I would recommend this to anybody, but as I said before it's only if you have money to burn.    Tldr: GameCube replacement stick feels great physically, but functions less than ideally for most games. Can be made better if you have the technical know-how, or splurge for a hori mini pad for another great-feeling controller."
n64,3bcx5r,Creature_73L,5,Sun Jun 28 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Don't buy these. They break down really easily, have way too much sensitivity, and cause lag. 1/10, do not recommend."
n64,3bcx5r,Creature_73L,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:57:16 2015 UTC,Maybe you got a defective joystick. I've installed 3 on three of my controllers and all work perfect I would give them a 10/10. These joysticks are for people to be able to use their controllers again without going out and buying another controller or even worst a 3rd party controller just to get a better joystick. Sensitivity? I think it's like the original and lag? No lag whatsoever.
n64,3bcx5r,pixiestix88,4,Sun Jun 28 13:08:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I have installed several myself with different brands and they all suck. If you want to understand then play super smash bros after you replace the stick. it sucks, It doesn't respond to quick movements very well, its mapped incorrectly and its a pain when you preform the same move over and over to only have a 1/6 chance of pulling it off. No me gusta"

n64,3bci04,PabloVermicelli,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:10:56 2015 UTC,The control sticks are incredibly easy to replace.  I'd recommend just enjoying them until they fail and replace them for about $10 each and enjoy your essentially new controller.  The rebuild sticks use the GameCube components so they actually last longer and are more durable to boot
n64,3bci04,Brandicus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard that replacement sticks dont have a quality of performance that stands up to the original, and of course I'd really like to keep my controllers in the original condition they are currently in. I suppose I could swap them out and keep the original parts on hand so thy can be switched ""back"" at any point. Ideally I'd like to use them as they are though. Even more ideally, I'd love a quality wireless option. Maybe I could go so far as swapping the sticks on the wireless ones I have?"
n64,3bci04,Brandicus,2,Sun Jun 28 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"Like anything else there are varying degrees of quality depending on the maker.  I play smash pretty regularly on my 64 and yes I can feel a difference, although I wouldn't necessarily call the gc sticks inferior, they just handle alittle differently.  They are more notchy and give you alittle more resistance than the classics.  It's honestly nothing you can't adjust to.  I would assume you can use the sticks in the aftermarket wireless controllers but I'd take them apart first and compare the connector just to be safe.  Happy gaming!"

Was going to purchase it but the lady said she couldn't get it it to work. She double checked before shipping.  We go back and forth for about a week or so to see if she could get it working. Finally offered to buy it from her cheaper since it wasnt working. I was going to try my luck and if not swap the boards with my plain 64. Talked her down to 60. Since you know the controller which is perfect was about 30, expansion runs 20 and the game 20-30 give or take. So it finally arrives, i plug it in and no go. Damn. So i try my own hookups no go. I decided to try one of my carts (Banjo Kazooie). Boom! Worked like a charm. Okay so i was like it must be the expansion pack. Gave it a jiggle and put DK64 in and now it plays like a dream. Very happy with this purchase not only in value but this was the color i grew up with at a friends house (never had a 64).  Put about 4 hours into DK64 already. Game is amazing especially for it's time. Fricken fast travel banana zippers!"

My N64 is the original color, I did buy later a gold controller to have a second controller. Speaking of the controllers, how are the sticks of the controllers? Are they good or worn?? I ask because I bought two atomic purple and one red controller on eBay and I got them cheap because they were in excellent shape but the sticks were worn. I bought on Amazon 5 GameCube style sticks for the N64 and they were easy to install and they work amazing!!! Just food for thought."
n64,3b9jg7,Geason,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:59:47 2015 UTC,Well the Green stick is like perfect. It's like the lady just had it in the closet or something for 19 years.  I have a purple that's like a 7/10 and a Grey that is a 9/10. i was considering gamecube sticks but i heard it can cause issues with games?

n64,3b9jg7,MeapTheCat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:20:46 2015 UTC,"On the three I installed, no issues with gameplay whatsoever and they are just about the same size plus you get the smooth feel of the GameCube stick. I would try it on the one you rated 7/10 just to try it out to see if you like it. I bought mine because the 3 controllers I bought were perfect condition but the stick was rated like 3/10 because of wear. Since then I bought 2 more sticks to change them on my original and gold controllers."

Whatever you do though, be aware that the vast majority of used controllers out there have very loose and worn-out joysticks.

The risk totally paid off its been around 16 or 17 years and it's still going strong! I packed major hours into the Z64 during the N64 prime, but it's been sitting in my console collection and getting used about once a year.

Ultimately I think he's going to struggle with any N64 game you give him - the N64 controller is pretty complex and totally unlike simply swiping left and right on an iPad (the device I see kids of that age playing the most). That said, here are the games I'd recommend:   Diddy Kong Racing. Obviously very similar to Mario Kart, but I always found it easier to get a hold of in terms of controls. It also has a great single-player campaign, and its characters and plot are quirkier and will probably appeal to someone of his age. This goes for about $15 on eBay. Super Mario 64. This might be the best bet because the open-world nature will allow him to just explore and learn how to play the game and how to use the controller more generally as he goes. He obviously won't collect 120 stars, but he'll pick up the easier ones and continue to improve. This goes for about $15-20 on eBay. Pokemon Snap. Great recommendation already posted here.

n64,3b5l3e,Creature_73L,7,Fri Jun 26 04:02:00 2015 UTC,I find it funny that the 'Holo' one is less valuable than the non-holo. It just goes against every thing I learned from collecting Pokemon cards as a kid.
n64,3b5l3e,Creature_73L,3,Fri Jun 26 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"Is it really? Wow I didn't know that. The regular Majora's Mask is more valuable to me because it's my original, I got it a couple weeks after release."

n64,3b4onj,hamofwheat,22,Thu Jun 25 23:05:37 2015 UTC,Just leave it. I think it adds to the history of the piece.
n64,3b4onj,ZadocPaet,10,Fri Jun 26 00:18:38 2015 UTC,I agree. we all know its conker and we all know its a awesome game. I understand why you hate the sticker but I agree it's part of the history. Blockbuster and that whole era of gaming are iconic I vote to leave it. Its doesn't detract from the game unless you plan on reselling it.
n64,3b4onj,generalozzman,3,Fri Jun 26 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"Its doesn't detract from the game unless you plan on reselling it.   Ya, and even then I think more and more collectors are receptive to things like that; especially when it's cart only."
n64,3b4onj,ZadocPaet,2,Fri Jun 26 03:32:51 2015 UTC,I have some 2 NTSC carts that have stickers saying:  For use in Nintendo NTSC Interactive Only This game remains the property of Nintendo Australia Pty Ltd. Not For Resale.  I don't understand why the Australian branch of nintendo would need any NTSC carts (outside of preventative methods).   I also have a few of the blockbuster cases with the games. I think it isn't important to have a pristine cart if you destroy the history of it.
n64,3b4onj,BadgerUltimatum,7,Fri Jun 26 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"Go back in time to Ferndale, MI 1998 and slap the employee who put this label on game rentals wrong before they can do any damage this masterpiece."
n64,3b4onj,UncleBling,5,Fri Jun 26 02:58:08 2015 UTC,Did you really just look up that Blockbuster store numbers old location? Conker was released in 2001 though.
n64,3b4onj,Creature_73L,5,Fri Jun 26 04:32:34 2015 UTC,I'd take a look at - http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/gsinf/informationators_comprehensive_snes_cartridge/
n64,3b4onj,danhood,7,Thu Jun 25 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"OP Try this:  Get a hair dryer and at medium heat (NOT high heat) start warming up the label. Try to evenly coat it and focus more on the blockbuster label.  Anyway, what this does is warm up the glue of the label and makes it peel off very easily. Even though it's warm, still go slow with the label removal. You should see the glue underneath separating, all stringy like cheese.  If you don't see it separating it's either not hot enough, or this type of glue wont work with heat.  BTW the reason I said not to use the HIGH setting, is that you can actually start fires by poitning a hair dryer at paper for long enough at close range. Also it can burn the label / cause ink discolorations, etc. Basically you want to warm the glue but not fry the thing.  If this method works, there might be some residue under where the label was. Use GooGone."

n64,3b4onj,Rep_from_Corwood,3,Thu Jun 25 23:13:13 2015 UTC,/u/orokro had a very solid suggestion but in case you do somehow damage the label you can always get a replacement one here.

n64,3b4onj,CGQuarterly,6,Fri Jun 26 00:10:15 2015 UTC,How to remove sticker: 1. Bring pot of water to boil. 2. Submerge cartridge in boiling water for 5 hours. 3. Regret taking my advice.
n64,3b4onj,Creature_73L,2,Fri Jun 26 04:28:49 2015 UTC,"You look at that label and think back on the Blockbuster experience. You think of how that game you're holding started it's life in 2001 displayed prominently on those glistening white shelves at Block Buster. Where wide and children and teens would walk by, grab the box to look at the game stills displayed, and decide if this is the game they would spend their saved up dollars on for the weekends enjoyment. Wanting to remove that sticker is wanted to remove all that history."
n64,3b4onj,Creature_73L,2,Fri Jun 26 04:27:11 2015 UTC,"Former Blockbuster employee chiming in, those stickers are designed to stay on. Maybe since the glue is so old a hair dryer might loosen it, but getting the residue off will be extremely difficult. I say leave it. That cartridge has a history."

On challenge 3, I only ran through the courses a couple of times each. I found that the challenge scores were...well...actually challenging. I know I'm not good at this game though so it's probably just that. Lots of fun....for a couple of hours. As said in the original thread, the game is very short. Replaying it got boring really quick."

n64,3b3bwv,tightfade,3,Thu Jun 25 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"There is small parts of reading, but the game play is much longer than any cut-scenes. As for pausing to choose weapons to win, that's not really how it is. It's a challenging game. You can beat most bosses with anything you want. Its more preference. Lets just say there is a reason its number one. If you liked SM64 or DK64, you should LOVE OoT. Just get it man. Even if you don't like it, play it. Everyone has, and its one of the most innovate games of all time and kinda shaped modern gaming."

n64,3b3bwv,swrrga,2,Thu Jun 25 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"First point: There are relatively few un-skippable cutscenes. There is a bit of dialog, but you can tap A to scroll through it as fast as you can read, or just press B to skip all the way to the end. I also hate boring dialog games and have never found OoT to be a bother.  Second point: I think you are describing turn-based battles, which are a staple of the RPG genre. All battles in Zelda happen in real time and you directly control the player character (run around, press B to sword, R to shield etc."

n64,3b3bwv,fenshield,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yes there's reading in it, being a story driven game. There's a lot more text than Super Mario 64, but it's far from being overwhelming. There are only a small handful of scenes in the game with long periods of text. No, it's not turn based strategy like Final Fantasy. All the battles are in real time, though occasionally you will have to go through a quick menu to switch weapons."

I know it might seem unfair comparing a console release title to one that had more time for development, but the worlds in Banjo Kazooie have so much more depth to them. Mario64's levels lack that most of the time. They are usually just so empty."
n64,3b3bwv,CatoAsAPun,2,Thu Jun 25 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that the game is in 3D and how it's basically the 3D equivalent to the first Mario Bros is what makes it feel empty. Even in the first Mario Bros, it was a 2D game so what was on the screen was what you get. In a 3D game there is actual empty space that cant just be filled with tilesets and enemies, which makes the game feel more empty. Being the first of it's kind Mario 64 is very basic with it's design and gameplay, but is still pretty fun to play IMO. Visually it hasn't aged well but it holds up in some places."

n64,3azmec,LoganRacing,7,Wed Jun 24 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"Story time: When I was a child, I got the N64 as my first game console. I loved racing games, particularly Mario Kart. My grandpa bought himself an N64 a few years later so we could play Mario Kart together, but my grandma died a few months after. The only other game he had besides Mario Kart was this Beetle Adventure Racing. It was new to me so we played it a lot when I went over to his house. I'll always associate that game with my grandpa. He passed away earlier this year and now I'm trying to buy a copy to add to my collection.   Also the battle mode is really fantastic."

I only really see it online though on eBay and have yet to ever see one at a yard sale or swap meet. Weird, since they sold a lot of copies."

n64,3aww6k,rickroy37,2,Wed Jun 24 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"Well I decided a little while back after finally beating Super Mario World for the SNES, that I want to go through all the Mario games. So after beating mario world 100% I went and started on the original super mario bros. on the Super Mario All Stars cart for the snes (which you can save on). During that play through I also took breaks and started on Super Mario 64, which I played as a kid, but didn't own back then (had a cousin that had it) and hadn't actually beaten it before. I have 100% beat mario bros (which includes both play throughs) and am on the clock world for super mario 64. My 1st 2 games to own for the 64 were Mario Kart & Banjo Kazooie. Which is probably my favorite platformer to date. I do wanna go back to Pokemon Stadium as well and beat that. How far are you along? Also, did you know pokemon stadium for the US is the second pokemon stadium for Japan?   And our pokemon stadium 2 is pokemon stadium Gold & Silver in Japan."

I immediately went out to the local video game store and bought Goldeneye with my saved up allowance, and he was right. That game was a must buy.

I forgot the name of the cord, but it's big and thick, and resembles a printer cable. You plug it into your computer (my new laptop doesn't have the plug for it, so it might have to be an older computer), then plug the other end into the back of the Gameshark. Then load up the program on your computer, type the codes in, and it instantly transfers them to the Gameshark. Will you save you A LOT of time."
n64,3avkww,n64answer,0,Wed Jun 24 00:43:25 2015 UTC,"1) I just did this with 22 games I bought on craigslist, see here for a lot of answers about it. Here's what I found to be the best way to clean them - it got every single non-working game working again. First, take apart the game (you can find tutorials online, you'll need a special screwdriver, linked to in the above post, that costs a few dollars). Once you get to the contacts, gently go over them with a white eraser. Then go over them with a Q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol. It's all extremely easy, and you can't really screw it up or damage the game if you're not rough with it.  I'll note that this is the most thorough way to clean them - you can also get a good cleaning if you simply use a Q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol in the cartridge slot (don't have to take it apart)."

Games where you saved a ""ghost"" (Mario, DKR, Tony Hawk) would take up pretty much the full card."

n64,3avzwa,ZadocPaet,8,Tue Jun 23 23:12:34 2015 UTC,The difference is probably that one was printed before the ESRB logos changed and one was printed after.   One's not more valuable than the other because people aren't specifically seeking out these kinds of variations.

n64,3am05i,n64answer,6,Sun Jun 21 15:17:10 2015 UTC,I've heard theories from removing hard to get to dust to putting enough moisture on worn away contacts for a charge to pass through.   All I know for sure is that the advice that says to never blow into the cartridges is non-sense.
n64,3am05i,AssCrackBanditHunter,2,Sun Jun 21 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"It is certainly not nonsense. The moisture in your breath is always 100% humidity relative to the outside air and can cause the contacts to corrode.   Something I've used for years to clean electrical contacts is something called Rail-Zip. Its main purpose is to clean model railroad tracks and increase conductivity, and it works wonders on cartridges. I've had NES games that went from constant screen blinking to booting up on the first try every time using Rail-Zip."
n64,3am05i,TheLeakyBurrito,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"That was my thought - that the small bit of moisture in your breath could actually help the electricity flow through. If that's true, I wonder if there's any other way to achieve this effect without blowing on the cartridges."
n64,3am05i,AssCrackBanditHunter,2,Sun Jun 21 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"graphite is an excellent conductor of electricity. If you run a nail file over a pencil tip you could collect some and use it on the contacts, but I've never tested it, and the possibility of the dust getting into your system and shorting stuff is pretty high... you know what, bad idea. Don't do this."
n64,3am05i,iSeize,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:29:31 2015 UTC,probably rubbing the contacts with an alcohol soaked Qtip to clean them
n64,3am05i,hack_jalsey,2,Sun Jun 21 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"Buy this: VGM Gold Security Screwdriver Bit (Female Star) (3.8mm VGM Gold Security Screwdriver Bit) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FYIFNL4/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_JyTHvbJ23V58H (I have this exact bit, it's opened HUNDREDS of cartridges and still hasn't stripped)  Then use an ordinary PINK PEARL (don't cheap out) to clean off the pins. This works on any cartridge based game and makes the pins look and work like new.   There's a video on youtube that goes into better detail, but basically, blowing into your carts is one of the worst things you can do. Your saliva is creating a better connection temporarily, but in the long run its causing corrosion and ruining your games.  Hope this helps!"
n64,3am05i,hack_jalsey,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Is there any reason why I would need to take the game apart to clean the contacts? I can get very good access just from the bottom with a Q-tip.   And by Pink Pearl, do you mean the Paper-Mate eraser? In that case I could see why you'd need to open it up."
n64,3am05i,ZadocPaet,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"The eraser actually removes the corrosion and polishes the contacts. It's a very quick process, plus the results make it worth your while. Just don't push TOO hard or else you'll break the cart."
n64,3am05i,genesiszidane,2,Sun Jun 21 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"Because there's moisture in the air you exhale, and that could improve the contacts. However, it does eventually corrode them."
n64,3am05i,genesiszidane,2,Sun Jun 21 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"What Zadoc said is very true, your best bet for getting your cartridges to work is buy the security bit for it and then open them up. Then use either isopropyl or a white eraser to clean the contacts."
n64,3am05i,ZadocPaet,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:35:37 2015 UTC,"I've used isopropyl alcohol, but I still wasn't able to get them working reliably. Would an eraser go beyond what I was able to do with the alcohol?"

It was the first time we could see the Pokemon we were all so obsessed and in love with in a natural setting like the show always showed. Unlike Pokemon Stadium which would just show them standing their and throwing moves at each other. It made you feel like you were really in the world of Pokemon for the first time.

I'd sure there are USB ones available, but in this day and age of digital TV and streaming I'd imagine demand for them would be low and the old PCMCIA ones are probably more likely to be binned than up for resale."

I'll go for a third just for the heck of it, but missed and the AI rubberband mechanics kicked in.  I'm pretty sure the ""catch-up"" algorithm doesn't kick in if you're far enough ahead.  ...or maybe it's a last-lap thing.  I need to experiment more :P  Eventually I'd like to create house rules for every map.  Luigi's raceway and moomoo farm are pretty dull so I had to get creative...  One I've done in the past is on Royal Raceway:   First Lap - Intentionally launch yourself into the mountainside off the big ramp Second Lap - You're required to ram your face into the castle doors before getting back on the track and finishing the lap Third Lap - You have to tank it left into the lake right before the finishline (for added suspense :P)"

n64,3abadl,MrBeerDrinker,3,Thu Jun 18 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, the angry aztec beetle or the crystcal cave one?  For Angry Aztec at the beginning you can attack the beetle (run+B) when you get near the edge of a slide that you can easily fall off, hold back on the control stick, this allows you to control tiny better, thus preventing you from falling off. If the beetle gets a head of you, stay close to him but not too close, you can also push forward on the control stick to slide faster, at the end of the race if he is a head, just attack him again and you should be in front.  For Lanky's race it's best to concentrate on getting the coins and trying to keep the beetle within view range. At the end when you are running towards the finish line, you can easily overtake him as Lanky is faster than he is."

You might try cleaning the contacts of the cartridge (dip a Q-tip in isopropyl alcohol and swab the contacts) as the console might not be able to read the game, in which case the red light will come on but nothing will show on the TV.   I haven't experienced this, but as I understand, some newer TVs simply won't play the N64 at all. Are you able to try it out on an old TV, ideally an old CRT, but even an older HDTV? That would help narrow down whether it's the console or the TV."

If its a third party cable (not official nintendo brand), those have a much higher tendency to not hold up over time.  Make sure the RCA cables from your n64 are plugged into a correct Yellow/Red/White input on your tv and it is switched to the correct input channel. You might be surprised how many people hook in their rca cables and think they need to be on channel 3 to play their console, when they actually just need to switch the tv to a different input."

It's recommended instead to use something like isopropyl alcohol on Q-tips, which in addition cleans them much more thoroughly."

I thought there were only 2 types of kiosks for n64 and this design looks like original or snes styling. It could even be one of those weird rare ones that only doctors offices and dentist type places bought for waiting rooms.

n64,3a5jnp,Geason,3,Wed Jun 17 13:02:14 2015 UTC,StarCraft 64 is a good answer.  Tough decisions.
n64,3a5jnp,rickroy37,2,Wed Jun 17 15:11:53 2015 UTC,"Ya, replay is key on a desert island."
n64,3a5jnp,ZadocPaet,2,Wed Jun 17 15:15:06 2015 UTC,"Replay, and also variety.  I put both Mario 64 and Zelda OoT for alone.  I think either of those two games are worthy of making the list, but I worry that putting two adventure style games in there is a mistake.  Perhaps I should have swapped one of the two in favor of a different genre for more variety, but I'd have a heck of a hard time deciding which one to swap out."
n64,3a5jnp,rickroy37,2,Wed Jun 17 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"I've never played Bomberman; I assumed it was single-player only. I guess I'll have to check it out.  I love Worms Armageddon so much on the PC - in fact there's still a small online community for it and I play online every once in a while. The N64 version seems to be a pretty good port of it, though I could never get the hang of it because of the difficulty of working the controls after playing on PC. I don't think I know anyone who has or has even ever played Worms on N64 since it's so rare and expensive - I guess I'd have a leg up over my fellow stranded travelers."
n64,3a5jnp,ZadocPaet,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:41:11 2015 UTC,The 2001 version of Bomberman 64 was released only in Japan. It has a four player classic mode. It's also about $120. It's the last official N64 game to be released in Japan.   The PAL version of Worms is only like $30 or $40. You can play PAL games on a US N64 with a Passport.
n64,3a5jnp,ZadocPaet,2,Wed Jun 17 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Why would the PAL version be so much cheaper? Were there more of them made, or is it just that demand is lower for PAL versions of N64 stuff in general?"
n64,3a5jnp,BullshitUsername,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:08:20 2015 UTC,Mostly there were a lot more sold. It was late in the life of N64 and it came out in the U.S. in January 2000. In Europe it was out in time for the 1999 Christmas season.
n64,3a5jnp,rQaBabaca,4,Wed Jun 17 15:19:42 2015 UTC,"Alone:  1) Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time  2) Super Mario 64  3) Mario Party 3  I was going to add another single-player RPG to this list but realized that after having beaten a single-player game, there might not be as much replay value to it, so I added Mario Party 3 because even though I'll be by myself, I can play long 50-round games with computer players that will be different every time and add a lot of replay value.  With others:  1) Super Smash Brothers  2) Perfect Dark  3) Mario Party 3  The biggest struggle for me with this list was whether I should add a racing game (e.g. Diddy Kong), but I figured the games listed above would have better replay value. Goldeneye is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of great multiplayer games, but at the end of the day Perfect Dark has better controls, more customization options, and is just more fun.  This was harder than I thought, and I'm not totally sure of my answers, so I'm looking forward to seeing other responses."

Banjo Tooie I just can't have one without the other. Tooie is such a perfect sequel I know I'll go crazy just having Kazooie without it. Not only is it harder and way longer of a game, but there are actually more records to keep. Plus, I don't have a speed run record and have never actually beat it 100%.

At any given time, there can be a spike of interest and demand, and prices can spike on sites like eBay. This is usually related to a popular Youtuber doing a review or lets play of an old game.

n64,39ytef,genesiszidane,2,Tue Jun 16 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"I would recommend using a new white eraser to clean the contacts, the eraser cleaned faster than the rubbing alcohol at least for me."

n64,39ytef,Gamecube007,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:45:26 2015 UTC,Did you test the cartridges? I usually use a Q-tip and some rubbing alcohol to clean cartridges. But for the outside There's many ways.
n64,39ytef,zeress1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:33:00 2015 UTC,I cleaned all the pins and the cartridges today. I was unable to get a proper bit to open up the games. That is a mission for tomorrow. I have yet to find my N64 (assuming it is still in the garage that was flooded) and if don't find it I will be driving around to multiple thrift stores in my area in search of one.
n64,39ytef,Will12239,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:17:46 2015 UTC,"Make sure you clean them (opening them for sure in this case, no matter how they look outside) before even thinking of trying to see if they work. The worst thing you could do at this point is trying to use any before giving them a very good and thorough cleaning."
n64,39xoc0,bruyamment,2,Mon Jun 15 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"As a set, it's worth 200-250 reasonably, but if you're selling individually, you're looking at more. The OG packaging (and the fact some of those are classic N64 games) is what's giving you the high price. Nice collection by the way! I'd kill for a packaged copy of Goldeneye."

And I've got some friends with collections, so I'll pass this post around with them as well!   But are you sure you're ready to sell? Kind of counter-productive for me as a buyer, but only sell if you have no use for them anymore. Don't make the same mistake I did lol"

n64,39tfw3,navinarom,2,Sun Jun 14 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"As far as the N64 showing black and white, that is probably something to do with the TV you're using. I've heard certain systems (NTSC vs. PAL) act differently on certain TVs, though I'm not too sure why, someone else can probably answer more in that regard.   As for the Everdrive 64, I always recommend Stone Age Gamer. They have a very nice Everdrive 64 that you can order for the N64 with little to no hassle. Yes, you load the games yourself. To do so, the Everdrive 64 has an SD card slot in the top. You take an SD card that has been formatted properly (you download the files either straight from the inventor krikzz himself, or if you buy from Stone Age Gamer it comes formatted), insert in into your computer, and download ROMs into a game folder on the card. If you download the proper ROMs, when you take the card back out and insert it into the Everdrive 64, you'll be able to scroll through the list of games you downloaded and choose one to play.   Sorry I couldn't help more with the black and white TV problems, did you make sure the cables were inserted into the proper ports in the TV?  Hopefully someone else can chip in."
n64,39tfw3,cjgerik,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"wow, thank you for the help! what would be my best bet if I want certain games and 64gb sd card too little? I already have some games but there are some games I can't find or are priced pretty high like conkers and the first 2 Mario party games."
n64,39tfw3,cjgerik,2,Sun Jun 14 17:02:19 2015 UTC,"A 64gb card can hold the entire N64 library!  In fact, I believe even an 8gb card can hold all of the games (maybe even smaller than that...).   With a 64gb card you don't have to worry about memory space at all. You can download any/all the games you want. Granted, I wouldn't just download the entire library, as there are games that you'll probably never play, so searching for and downloading each ROM individually is your best bet.   No problem! I own three different Everdrives, and am in love with them all. Helping others to be able to use them is something I enjoy."
n64,39tfw3,cjgerik,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:13:27 2015 UTC,Where exactly do I go to download the roms? Any site in particular. And that saves me more money haha. I'll get a 16gb. I just wanna be able to enjoy the games I was owned as a kid haha sorry I'm really bad at all this stuff
n64,39tfw3,n64answer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:15:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd go for a 16gb, that seems to be what most people choose.   I always go to Emuparadise, I haven't downloaded any bad ROMs from there. Other people seem to like Coolrom, though I have never used it so I can't vouch for it personally.   If worst comes to worst, you can always Google ""[game name] ROM"" and see which sites pop up. Then do a quick search to see what people say about the credibility of each website before choosing one to download it from."

There was a massive delay though.  Then I took it to work and plugged it into our projector and basically gave the same video quality, albeit with no delay. I tried turning down the brightness and playing with the contrast, but it didn't help at all.  But when the screen went dark (Pokemon Stadium 2) the colours came in really nicely.  Edit: youtube video of the washed out colours.  According to a google search and the seller on ebay, it's just due to newer monitors/tvs.  If I were using an analog tv it should look how it should."

n64,39g579,swrrga,2,Thu Jun 11 15:25:50 2015 UTC,Check out eBay or see if any second hand electronics stores in your area have them. You could even try Craigslist. These games aren't super difficult to come by.

If you feel for it or you have a lot of money, pick up some more video games like Diddy Kong Racing, Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64, Majora's Mask, 007, Star Fox 64, and more."

n64,394542,pixiestix88,2,Tue Jun 9 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"Story:    So i have been trying to get a N64 since i always wanted one as a kid. I have tried to get two different N64 on craigslist and the seller replies back but then suddenly they just go dark. So i guess someone just offers a better price and they take it from me. Next i finally score this sweet Green 64 with DK but before the seller ships the item she double checks the system to make sure it works. No go. So she is cancelling the item. Frustrated and defeated i posted on facebook to see if any my friend wanted to sell there N64. One of my friends pipe in saying she would sell me her N64 plus all the games for $150. I asked about what the games were. After the first few i was like ""Sold!"" When she stops by she was like i have all the boxes for the games too. I was in shock. She even threw in the switch in for free!    I was considering selling a few of the games/boxes for a green 64. Since i really want the green one. But im not sure yet.

I play it time to time when I visit them for family get togethers. I customized my N64 last summer, you should check it out when you get a chance!

n64,390vno,n64answer,5,Mon Jun 8 12:57:32 2015 UTC,Here's an interesting fact I came across in looking these games up: Virtual Chess 64 uses a game engine that beat Deep Blue (the computer that beat Kasparov). That probably contributes to why the game is considered so difficult. Pretty cool to think they put that engine on an N64 cartridge you could play at home.
n64,390vno,santoscrew,3,Mon Jun 8 12:58:03 2015 UTC,That game was very difficult but also very exploitable. I could beat the A.I. because it made some strange decisions. There were some openings that the VC64 just couldn't handle. I also put the VC64 against Chessmaster to see who would win (CM won easily) and at one point I tried to rank Virtual Chess on Chessmaster on PC. Long time ago (15 years maybe?) so I forgot how that went.
n64,390vno,swrrga,2,Mon Jun 8 13:07:13 2015 UTC,Was the VC64 engine deterministic?  Given that you played a certain set of moves would it always respond the same way?
n64,390vno,santoscrew,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would respond the same way. I'm nowhere near a good chess player but I could get an advantage early on against VC64. Like steal a queen early on. But I have to check again to make sure. I'll try on an emulator soon."

n64,390vno,rQaBabaca,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"Starcraft... great game, but not meant for a home console. I guess it was a good alternative for those that didn't have a PC, but even back in 2000 most people would have a home computer they could have played it on, so there really was no need for this. Using a controller to play this game is ludicrous. A mouse and keyboard are required"
n64,390vno,rickroy37,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should chime in and stick up for this game. I admit Star Craft was much better on PC, but I still think it's one of the best RTS console adaptations ever. The controller wasn't as good as a keyboard, but to their credit they made it about as good as it could have been on console. This was back when developers were still toying with trying to get RTS games onto console, and I'm glad they attempted.  Also, split screen multiplayer was kinda cool."

n64,38wdo7,Ensure1988,0,Sun Jun 7 17:24:56 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this is a slightly dulled gold one. They look more silver then gold if they have sun damaged. They go for around $100 in good condition in the us with the controller. If it has the expansion pack in it (lift up the bay and it would be red not black) those are about 35 by themselves. I'm not sure if it came with this bundle or not. Still it's a pretty nice find and one of the cooler or the n64's in my opinion.  http://videogames.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/gold-nintendo-64-system
n64,38wdo7,Ensure1988,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"It looks too evenly silver all over to be dulled gold - surely if it was sun damaged there'd be some parts of it that were still more gold than silver?

I remember walking up and down that dam, to the end and back, exploring all those guard towers, trying to figure out how the hell to finish the level.  So someone tell me, am I an idiot? Was there something cluing you in to the fact you had to jump off?"
n64,38o7gb,n64answer,3,Fri Jun 5 14:52:51 2015 UTC,Back then I did it by pure luck. But it's one of the first scenes in the movie so I'm guessing that is supposed to be how players would know about that scene when first playing.

Plus the whole final level takes like an hour to get through and there's no way to save in the middle if the level. So if your N64 jams or you have to go somewhere you have to redo it all 😪
n64,38o7gb,eDoctor,2,Fri Jun 5 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"That level and Boss were so damn hard, I had to use a help guide like 16 times just to get to the boss. Once I got to the boss I dead like 400 times. (Which in bomberman is super annoying bc you lose your power ups after 3 deaths.

We got the most out of it by creating our own game modes to supplement the few options there, such as a ""VIP"" mode where the last person to score a kill would become the VIP and then everyone else would then call a truce and focus on the VIP, or a rabbit mode which was similar but whoever became the rabbit was no longer allowed to fight back (could only try to run and evade the hunters)  had tons of fun, but the limited options really killed it, even with unlocking the tank and infantry options, the problem there being that unlocking those aspects of the game was difficult enough to the point that by the time I unlocked the infantry option, I was good enough at the game because of that successful effort that I was able to easily 1 v 3 my friends and it didn't take long for them to lose interest, understandably so."

My proudest moment as an N64 gamer was probably in 2002. I was 12, and I was spending the night at a friend's house, and he was in the process of beating Ocarina of Time. I had already beaten it a few times, and I figured I was pretty good at it at this point.  That morning, I was asleep, and my friend woke me up to help him with the forest temple. I guided him through the entire thing, then told him how to beat phantom gannon, all without turning to see the TV, I was half asleep facing the wall.  I'll never forget that. No game has make me learn it inside and out like Ocarina of Time."

He was a better gamer than I was (due in no small part to him being allowed to play as much as he wanted, whereas I was limited to only 20 minutes each on Friday and Saturday, and that's if my parents were in a good mood), so he was a condescending little bitch like that. :P  I'm proud to say that I beat Ganondorf/Ganon without even dying, despite never getting to fight almost every other boss.

I was so fucking hyped and I rubbed it in her dumb face.  Most recent proud moment was when I got stoned and beat Super Mario 64 in 88 minutes (using the infinite staircase backward jump glitch) last summer.

n64,38bs6w,Saylur,8,Wed Jun 3 04:59:12 2015 UTC,"Contrary to what people are saying, the games are not the same.  It's very minor, but Banjo-Kazooie on the N64 does not save which individual notes or jinjos you have collected, just the number of notes in a level or whether you've collected all the jinjos in a world. This means that to collect 100 notes or all the jinjos in a level you need to do it in one go, whereas on the xbox version leaving a world and coming back will not cause the jinjos or notes to respawn and they will stay collected.  Now, this is due to a hardware limitation (specifically the amount of memory required) on the N64 that they'd managed to work around by the time Banjo-Tooie came out, and the original intention was for the game to remember individual notes/jinjos that the player has collected. Which means that the xbox version is actually closer to the original intentions of the creators than the N64 one. But in my opinion this leaves the game less challenging and feeling empty once you've achieved 100%.  Then there's Stop&Swap, which is kinda implemented in both the remakes, albeit very unceremoniously. This means that the worlds will look a little different in BK (shark food island will be raised, the barrel will be open in mad monster mansion, etc) without having to 'earn' the changes, the eggs and ice key also don't carry over to BT, they're used to unlock items in Nuts&Bolts. And unlocking the extras in BT is made a lot simpler and doesn't require finding the N64 carts IIRC because the carts are again used for unlocks in Nuts&Bolts. The games will also mention Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, and if you'd rather forget that game existed you're out of luck.  In addition to the above, all the Nintendo references have been removed. This leaves the remakes feeling more 'clinical' and is a little jarring if you grew up when Nintendo and Rare were a team IMO.  Like I said, minor differences, but worth knowing.  As to which version to get, the xbox versions are great and, besides the exceptions noted above, play exactly the same albeit with clearer graphics and smoother gameplay and are well worth buying. If you have a N64 already though you really owe it to yourself to buy these games, no point owning the system if you aren't going to play some of the best games it has to offer."

n64,388u6m,n64answer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:12:33 2015 UTC,The market for Japanese games (at least in the U.S.) seems pretty narrow given eBay prices. Japanese versions of popular N64 games go for much less than do U.S. versions.

You'd have to blindly navigate menus and would miss all the important dialogue and text. It would seem to me that any money you save by buying the Japanese versions over the U.S. versions would be outweighed by the loss in the experience."

I wonder if the Superman 64 creators had any idea how bad it was. Does anyone know this or know of articles about it? I wouldn't be surprised if they knew and were just either 1) really rushed to get a game out on some timetable or 2) trying to cash in on an established property.
n64,382ppl,mickeeoo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:10:34 2015 UTC,Yeah there was a really good LP of it by I think Proton Jon was the guy's name. He actually sent some questions to the developer and got some answers. Apparently the guys who owned the Superman brand vetoed a load of their ideas really late in the process and the devs then had to rush to get something out before the license expired.

n64,37zc28,UnrealZoidberg,1 point,Sun May 31 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"I did some internet searching. Here's what I found:  ""N64 sticks are notorious for breaking down and wearing out. This is what I suggest for every one: If the joystick is still OK, take preventative measures before it's too late. Disassemble the joystick and clean any debris out of it, then lube it up and put it back together. This will keep it from breaking down.  Here's why: If you take a look inside an N64 joystick you'll see exactly what I'm taking about. When you move the stick around, plastic is grinding on plastic. If you open a stick that was never lubed and heavily used, you'll see a bunch of plastic dust inside. This is why the sticks get loose, too much plastic grinding away into dust. Some of them get clunky because of the dust. That's why if you have a joystick that's still like new, it is very important to clean it and lube it up so it doesn't break down!  If a joystick is already on it's way out, you can still take it apart to clean and lube it. It might still be OK to use, just a little loose. Some joysticks will be beyond fixing though. For example, my most heavily used stick from back in the day was too far gone. Even after I cleaned it and lubed it up, it wasn't responsive like it once was.  I've bought a couple of these: http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-REPLACEMENT ... 077wt_1110  They're very good, but a little too sensitive for some games (mostly FPS when you can't adjust the sensitivity, or any game where you need to precisely aim).

n64,37xqgw,ZadocPaet,3,Sun May 31 08:37:11 2015 UTC,LCDs have a bit of input lag: time from N64 creates the frame 'till it gets displayed. Some TVs have a 'game' mode which lowers it.

Quake 64 is a fun and challenging FPS, but it is always compared to the superior PC version. IMO it was the best console version in the generation. Rush is a classic racer and you should get the rest of the series. WipeOut 64 was a fantastic conversion and very challenging."

n64,37mqnq,lechuck333,2,Thu May 28 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"In general, with any console RGB mod, you can get sync from three places: CSYNC, Luma, and Composite Video. Very few N64 models even have RGB available to enable, and even fewer have the CSYNC circuit built in. So, in the absence of CSYNC, you have to turn to alternatives. Luma is preferred over Composite Video for the N64 because it has less noise. Luma has the sync plus brightness, whereas Composite Video has sync, brightness, and color.  If your N64 has the CSYNC circuitry, you can go with that cable, but you'll have to open up the console and look on the board itself to see if the parts are present on the board."
n64,37mqnq,xamphear,1 point,Thu May 28 20:21:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I've never heard of sync-on-luma.  For what it's worth, I RGB-modded my N64 and am just using composite sync, with no problems whatsoever.  Is this cable more expensive?  If not, doesn't hurt to get it, I guess."
n64,37mqnq,Nosen,1 point,Thu May 28 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert at all, but i use the sync on luma cable and have had no problems with it. It even worked when plugging straight into the TV!"
n64,37mqnq,Keyframe,1 point,Thu May 28 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"Regarding sync, if you use rgb on n64, is there a possibility of image shifting? I have an rgb cable out of mega drive (genesis) and I have a picture slightly shifted. It is kind of annoying if you can't control hsync on your tv. Heard it depends on sync source and is possible with other consoles as well then."
n64,37mqnq,The_Fungineer,1 point,Thu May 28 22:31:32 2015 UTC,What's the reason for this mod? Is there any image improvement or is this just if your TV only has RGB connections available?
n64,37mqnq,SOSpammy,2,Fri May 29 00:16:57 2015 UTC,"RGB provides the best picture quality you can get on retro consoles by far. However, I've heard the N64 is the console it makes the least difference with.  The only thing better is a pure digital signal coming straight from the system's processors like the way the upcoming N64 HDMI mod does."

DK64, Banjo Kazooie and Tooie, GoldenEye, Perfect Dark, Jet Force Gemini, Blast Corps, Diddy Kong Racing, Mickey Speedway USA, and Conker's Bad Fur Day.   Also, get Ocarina of Time. You should play that before Majora's Mask (I personally like Majora's Mask better, but it takes place after OOT)."

n64,378mkm,Jon_from_HR,2,Tue May 26 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"Well, its a combination of loving older games and getting it for free from my aunt :P. The n64 is probably my favorite console, can't wait for this summer being able to play Donkey Kong 64, Diddy Kong Racing, and a few other games on my backlist, along with 3DS games. I currently have a 3rd party S+NES, the n64, a wii (for gamecube games and wii games in my room), and wii u (in the family room), along with a GBA SP and DS lite. Just need a Virtual Boy and Game and Watches now."
n64,378mkm,mattheww00,3,Tue May 26 00:33:17 2015 UTC,"I'm jealous of the position you're in - getting to experience the N64 for basically the first time. Banjo-Kazooie is a great next choice, it's a total blast. What have your favorite games been so far?"
n64,378mkm,Jon_from_HR,2,Tue May 26 00:39:25 2015 UTC,"Idk, Ocarina of Time was really good, and I played Super Mario 64 DS before I got the n64, so i guess in a way, its the second time. Edit: Since Ocarina of Time is accepted as the best game ever, i should probably put another game: Paper Mario"

If you're into DK 64, may I suggest Jet Force Gemini on the N64? It's from Rare, the same developer as DK 64. It's my personal favourite N64 game. It's a third person shooter, but it has a lot of collecting, much like DK64. Also like DK 64, there's multiple characters to use and explore/re-visit the worlds with"

n64,379qrc,EFFENEH,3,Tue May 26 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"I would personally do all this on Ebay. (both the selling and pricing out)  You can see what people have all of their carts listed at and price accordingly.  You will get the most money (in my unprofessional opinion) from selling things individually or 2-4 games bundled strategically in bids with a high end ""Buy It Now"" price.  I say put 1 or 2 controllers in a bundle with each n64, and sell the rest of the controllers (especially more rare ones) individually. Be sure to know the shipping costs and how to ship in your area and calculate your actual profit. This is all for the sake of highest dollar, of course.  I am sorry you are having to sell your stuff.  Best of luck."
n64,379qrc,nobleaggie,2,Tue May 26 01:29:20 2015 UTC,Figuring out the shipping/handling is what has scared me off in the past. I will look into this though and see if it's reasonable. How does Ebay take it's cut?
n64,379qrc,trashedputin,2,Tue May 26 03:26:14 2015 UTC,"Ebay takes 10%. Your PayPal will get a bill that I believe pays immediately as long as there are funds in the account.  Ebay will also calculate shipping for you as long as you have the weight, which is easy because usually ebay already has the weight of common items.  It really is pretty easy and painless. Probably the best way to get the most out of your money because it casts such a wide night, although if you don't need money super quick I would try craigslist for a week with Conker's and smash."
n64,379qrc,n64answer,2,Tue May 26 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"This website will give you pretty accurate prices for everything, but the best way is to use eBay's advanced search function and search sold listings, as that shows what things actually went for in an auction setting.   The best way to do it in terms of maximizing how much money you get is to do eBay. Even after their cut, you'll get the highest price. If you try to sell the stuff in any other medium, people will expect to pay lower-than-eBay prices (e.g. on Craigslist, or if you try to trade the games in to a video game store). That discount is usually more than or equal to the eBay cut.  The issue of course is the hassle involved with selling the games. If I were you I would purchase an inexpensive pack of padded envelopes on Amazon, since it'll add up if you have to purchase them at the Post Office every time. But once you have the envelopes, games are pretty easy to package safely and ship. As for the shipping cost, I'd recommend just setting a flat rate for all your games (around $3.99 or so); some games will cost more to ship (e.g. if your buyer is farther away) and some less, and overall they'll probably even out. But the shipping cost really isn't that material. In reality, buyers on eBay just look at the total price (price+shipping). It makes no difference to a buyer if they buy a game for $10 with free shipping or a game for $7 with $3 shipping, and so buyers adjust for this as they purchase. So if set the shipping cost for Smash unreasonably high at $20, buyers would still bid, they would only bid up to $30 (since the market price is right around $50). Hope that makes sense - I bring this up just to say that I wouldn't worry much about shipping cost.  One last thing to think about on the hassle issue of eBay is that there's also hassle involved with selling in other mediums. Even if you were to sell it as a lot on Craigslist, you'd have to deal with scammers, lowballers, finding a safe place to do the transaction, and requests to part it out. All these issues would be magnified if you didn't sell it as a lot on Craigslist but tried to part it out."

n64,379qrc,yoda2634,1 point,Tue May 26 04:17:28 2015 UTC,I've realized I'm not using it and don't see it happening in the future. I've really enjoyed collecting over the years but im transitioning in my life and honestly I think with the money I get from this I'm going to buy a ps4 with controllers. Gaming with friends was the best part about the n64 to me and I want to do that again but we don't play the old games much anymore.
n64,377xvn,n64answer,4,Mon May 25 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"Bomberman 64: The Second Attack is one of the few games I still need. It was released so late into the N64 life cycle, not as many were made, and it's more rare and obscure. Goes for a higher price, being one of the more expensive N64 games. Anyone want to sell me a copy for low, low cheap?!"
n64,377xvn,rQaBabaca,2,Mon May 25 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, I had no idea it was so sought after. I just checked pricecharting and it says the going loose price is $90, which is up there with Conker and Worms. Now I know to keep my eyes peeled for it.  Out of curiosity, what other games do you need? And are you trying to collect the entire set of games released in NA (or some other country)?"
n64,377xvn,rQaBabaca,2,Mon May 25 18:50:40 2015 UTC,Going for a full NA collection. I'm only 7 games shy. I need:   Bomberman 64: The Second Attack Chameleon Twist 2 Clayfighter: Sculptors Cut Harvest Moon 64 Hydro Thunder Snowboard Kids Worms Armageddon
n64,377xvn,rQaBabaca,2,Mon May 25 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"So how are you trying to collect these? Obviously you could just buy them on eBay at any time - have you been trying to track down the expensive ones on craigslist or at flea markets, etc. - places where the sellers don't exactly know what they have?  And I know quite a few of those are very expensive, but what about Snowboard Kids and Hydro Thunder? Those don't seem to be too pricey."
n64,377xvn,PabloVermicelli,2,Mon May 25 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"I've amassed most of my collection (over 200 games) by never paying more than $5. Then I started running into walls, and upped my limit to $10. Then $15, now I'm at $20. So basically, yah, I'm trying not to spend ebay/retail prices on the games. I'm in no rush to finish my collection, so I'll wait it out until I can find a good deal, whether it be ebay, craigslist/kijiji, garage sales, flea markets, or trading with friends.  As for Snowboard Kids and Hydro Thunder, for me to outright buy them on eBay with shipping to Canada would be over $20, so that's higher than my limit"
n64,377xvn,kingdude139,4,Mon May 25 22:12:13 2015 UTC,"That's a cool approach - it also spreads out the time it takes to collect them all, which is really the fun part. Congrats on getting so far."

That gives you a list of the most common places people go to buy N64 stuff.  The only way you'll get something for a ""low price"" (one below market price) is to buy it from someone who doesn't know what they have, e.g. someone on Craigslist or at a garage sale. If someone's selling it on eBay, the price will be bid up to market price. If a retailer is selling it (including online retailers), they've done the research and they know what price they can get.  So don't expect to find ""deals"" anywhere but places like Craigslist."

Pick one that's a suitable size, and try and find one that's not had too much use, as the brightness fades over time iirc.

n64,36uxu9,whisky_pete,3,Fri May 22 22:34:31 2015 UTC,If it were me I would definitely take a stab at swapping the internals. I'm sure it can't be that hard.

The Game of the Month for June will be Goldeneye 007, and I am planning on including a challenge for the Game of the Month similar to how I did for Star Fox 64.  You are welcome to initiate a Mario Kart 64 challenge of course.  Otherwise I can make Mario Kart 64 the GotM for July and include it then.  Up to you.  And you're on, by the way!  Edit: Whoops, see my response.  If you want Mario Kart 64 as GotM vote for it here."
n64,36sc3u,rickroy37,7,Thu May 21 22:00:52 2015 UTC,Lets do it as a GotM. Great idea!

We are going to have the community vote on the GotM instead of leaving the mods to select the game.  Letting the community vote gets more community involvement, and it will allow us to get a wider variety of games rather than say, having me select the games as it would bias me toward selecting games that I like or own.  This miscommunication was my fault and for that I'm sorry, but we will be relying on voting for the July GotM instead of dictating it.  My suggestion would be to head over to the voting thread and voting for Mario Kart 64.  The highest ranked game will be June, the 2nd highest will be July, and we'll do another round of voting in 2 months.  Again, I'm sorry about that.  If Mario Kart 64 doesn't win GotM and you want help organizing some kind of challenge let me know, and hopefully I won't screw up next time!"

n64,36sc3u,dashn64,5,Fri May 22 02:27:43 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely do this, but PAL times are very different to NSTC times :("
n64,36sc3u,dashn64,1 point,Thu May 21 22:13:51 2015 UTC,How different are they? I just thought they would be the same.
n64,36sc3u,Harpa,3,Fri May 22 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"Here's what /u/Harpa said 9 months ago:   PAL is 50 Hz, NTSC 60. Pretty much all games were designed for NTSC, so when you play them on PAL they'll simply run slower (83% of normal speed). If you've always played PAL you might not notice it, but once you try out NTSC you realize how huge the difference is. PAL feels like slow-motion afterwards.   So it is a huge difference, unfortunately. I guess I could play on emulator (I have one of the n64 adapters to use on pc) but don't know if that would be allowed. I've also got one of the carts where you can put ROMs on it, so I could give that a go and see if that changes anything... doubt it though.  EDIT: here's a decent comparison - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QqPtdA0wpw"
n64,36sc3u,dashn64,2,Fri May 22 00:26:32 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, I got mentioned!  If you still want to do this challenge, there are two possibilities: Either you can use an emulator, the recommended one would be Project 1.7. You could stream to prove you're not cheating.  Or, the much simpler solution, just convert your PAL times to NTSC:  http://www.mariokart64.com/mk64/convert.shtml  This conversion is really accurate and it's what they use to compare PAL and NTSC times for the world records."
n64,36sc3u,rickroy37,1 point,Fri May 22 09:10:45 2015 UTC,Perfect! Thanks heaps. I've been hoping for a while there was a tool like this. I'll probably use that method since it's much more convenient. Take care mate.

n64,36rpbm,noticeperiod,1 point,Thu May 21 21:14:45 2015 UTC,So you bought a used one?  I was looking at new ones - around $175 - pretty pricey!  Somebody must know how/where to get the game files.

As for the other question, you'll want it to come with a CIC chip, and I guess the question is whether you want to play PAL games or not.

If youhavent got one yet, and you love playing N64, honestly, get one..... playing JPN games too is great, havent found any translated ones yet.

n64,36r3fl,NintendoGuy128,3,Thu May 21 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"That's truly the nostalgia of playing Nintendo 64 games, they were made in the time of early 3d game rendering and game designers barely had a concept of level design let alone a grasp of fluid and intuitive interface mechanics. You cant review a Nintendo 64 game as if it were a brand new AAA title for a current gen console."
n64,36r3fl,BuddhaRocks,2,Thu May 21 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. However I'm comparing it to it's counterparts such as Banjo and Conker which don't have the specific issues I've mentioned in the post. And as I said, it seems reviewers at the time had these issues with the game too."
n64,36r3fl,outaccountant,2,Thu May 21 18:40:34 2015 UTC,A big improvement/time saver would be if you could switch characters on the fly.
n64,36r3fl,johnbenede,1 point,Thu May 21 13:43:38 2015 UTC,"The navigation between characters and levels was tedious at times.  I hated feeding Troff 'n Scoff - why can't I just give them ALL the bananas collected at once, rather than having to do it for each character?  But the overall game play was still lots of fun.  Sometimes it was tricky to figure out how to do things by using each character's unique skills/weapons.  I don't remember if I ever finished that one.  (We're talking MANY years ago)"

n64,36rjbm,n64answer,2,Thu May 21 15:36:17 2015 UTC,Love this idea. Star Wars Episode 1 Racer was a very good racing game IMO. Perfect Dark is of course a fantastic game and one of my favorite FPS's of all time. War Gods I remember seeing and hearing about years ago but never played.  Never played World Cup 98.
n64,36rjbm,egnaro64,2,Thu May 21 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"I spent so many hours on Episode 1: Racer.  I'm surprised that haven't made a similar racing game for Star Wars in enhanced graphics and just a slight less rubberbanding. (The rubberbanding was redonk) I'm guessing it would sell like hotcakes.  I really like this idea, by the way!"
n64,36rjbm,nobleaggie,1 point,Thu May 21 16:37:16 2015 UTC,"What is rubberbanding? I've never played Episode 1: Racer but based on the reviews and comments I think I should.  Also, does Episode 1: Racer have a single-player mode? How is it? I imagine it's a lot of fun playing with other people, but unfortunately I don't know that many people who will come over for marathon N64 sessions."
n64,36rjbm,nobleaggie,1 point,Thu May 21 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"Episode 1 is a great game! It has both single and multi player modes, and both are pretty fun! Rubberbanding is whenever you are in the lead the competitors basically get a speed boost so they have a better chance of catching up to you.  If you have ever played any of the Mario Kart series, and played 150cc, you could land every trick and shortcut perfectly and the person in 2nd would be close behind no matter what!"

I used to love playing multiplayer with friends and even by myself with bots (an awesome addition)."
n64,36rjbm,PabloVermicelli,2,Thu May 21 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"I prefer Goldeneye's single player, but Perfect Dark's multiplayer, thanks to the bots and customization.  I remember when Halo came out and being disappointed that there were no multiplayer bots.  Perfect Dark spoiled me in that regard."

n64,36rjbm,fadlebadle,1 point,Thu May 21 16:48:37 2015 UTC,I loved Star Wars Episode 1: Racer's vehicle upgrade system.  It was cool that the parts would break on you.  And I'm sorry but it must be said:  Dreamcast had the superior version of Star Wars Episode 1: Racer.  But it did come out a year earlier on N64...
n64,36rjbm,rickroy37,1 point,Thu May 21 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"I played the crap out of World Cup 98 (on the PS1, but please forgive me), really enjoyed it and I remember I even went back to it when the 2002 World Cup game on my gamecube wasn't cutting it. There was added excitement due to the less realistic game.  Played a lot of Perfect Dark too, my friends weren't really into the multiplayer for some reason, despite my best efforts, but I was able to use bots and still get great enjoyment out of it, and I loved the single player too. A great sequel to Goldeneye in my view. Personally didn't think Time Splitters held up as well, but I played those games when I was much older.  Downloaded Star Wars Racer for the PC a while ago, still haven't got around to playing it yet.  This is a great idea btw."
n64,36rjbm,rickroy37,1 point,Fri May 22 06:47:11 2015 UTC,"I have a funny memory of Perfect Dark that comes to mind every time I think about it. In Carrington Institute (the place Dark was before you start missions), there was a shooting range where you could test out weapons. If you positioned yourself correctly, you could prop the door open and shoot at the Carrington Institute people just outside the door. They couldn't die, but you could shoot them. I don't know why this was so tempting and funny to me, but I remember trying to see how many knives I could get to stick in one of them like a pincushion.   Anyone else as twisted as I was?"

That's not interesting, we've all seen the cartridge covers of games.  What is interesting to me is when someone posts pictures of their setup, like how they have their TV/N64/games configured (e.g. they might have a cool shelving system or a whole area devoted to N64). I'd also lump into this things like the post from the other day that included pictures of all the games with the top stickers, which I thought were unique and probably highlighted to many people (myself included) that those stickers were even available.  Those types of posts are interesting and can give people ideas on how to configure their own setups. But I would agree that ideally I'd like to see fewer posts that are just ""Here's a picture of the 20 game cartridges I own spread out on my floor."""
n64,36nuko,JebusOfEagles,3,Thu May 21 11:56:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, its not too bad. Its interesting seeing what people enjoy. We shouldn't add rules where people can't share their stuff to the sub, that sounds ridiculous."
n64,36nuko,BuddhaRocks,7,Fri May 22 06:20:55 2015 UTC,"It's hard to poo-poo N64 gaming collection posts in a subreddit devoted to N64 gaming, but I get what you're saying.  It's almost like selfies - it's one thing to be proud, another to be annoying.  Everybody should be entitled to at least one collection submission, and it would be good if they were posted the same day every week - call it ""Collection Post Wednesday"" or something."
n64,36nuko,LKJ55,3,Wed May 20 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"I think this is the right solution. Let people post their collections, but limit it to one day. Can the mods get on top of this?"
n64,36nuko,egnaro64,3,Thu May 21 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"i do appreciate collections, but it kinda feels partially arrogant to me :/"
n64,36nuko,bigc04,2,Thu May 21 00:22:11 2015 UTC,Why don't we make one single thread dedicated to peoples' collections where people can post a link to a picture of their collection? That way we both win. People can post their collections and people can comment on them and at the same time we keep this sub from becoming overwhelmed by collection threads.
n64,36nuko,haybitch7,4,Fri May 22 14:30:18 2015 UTC,"I had been tempted to create a post just like this, but figured that I would just get down-voted to oblivion.  Literally the only posts from /r/n64 that make it to my front page (which is populated by nothing but retrogaming and YouTube subs) are people's pics of their collections.  I actually thought about un-subbing today because of it.  We should just have a stickied ""post a pic of your collection"" thread.    Edit: I just want to say that it isn't that I don't think that it's ok to be proud of your collection or anything, but I think that these days there is too much of a fascination with posting pictures of your stuff.  It doesn't foster conversation unless you have something unusual in your collection.  I used to subscribe to /r/bicycling, but quit because I felt like every post was just people showing off their bike.  This sub should be full of conversations centered around the N64.  Talk about a game that you just beat.  Post a high score and challenge people to beat it.  Do a mini-review of a game.  Talk about your memories of the console from back in the day."

n64,36nuko,BondoMondo,2,Thu May 21 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"So what would you like to see then? Here are some examples:   I don't really mind the collection posts, let us post them if we want to. If not, make a weekly thread for collections, and another one for said weeks purchases.  Speedruns (as already suggested by /u/_Gaybraham_Lincoln_ (hope I got it right)). Maybe once a week, start with one game and let the winner of it choose the next game.  High scores (same as above).  What are you playing? Post a picture of the game you're currently playing, along with thoughts and your progress. Weekly releases thread: here someone would post a list of games released during this week, 15-20 years ago. Discuss the games.  Hardware help thread. Do you have problems connecting your scart cable to your new led tv? Is your game cart/controller/console making a noise and you want to take it apart but you don't know how? Ask here! Tutorials: how to get rid of price tags from your cart without damaging the label, fixing the loose thumbstick (or whatever it's called), or painting your console.    What do you all think of these ideas?"

n64,36nuko,momentumlost,0,Fri May 22 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great idea - I really like the weekly releases thread idea, as it will get people talking about different games that might not otherwise have sparked conversation.  I'm also trying to cover some of the hardware help stuff in the FAQ I'm working on.  Not sure how this stuff would be implemented - for something like the weekly releases thread, someone would just have to step up and volunteer to make one every week, it seems. I think it'd be easy to do based on this Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Nintendo_64_games. Maybe I'll give setting one up a shot."

Got access to a vinyl printer/cutter throu work which comes in handy :) I found all the graphics at thecoverproject.net, and then I cropped them to size, and added the N64 logo.  If you make your own, I recomend trying to find vinyl sticker paper instead of regular paper ones, they should be easier to remove without leaving much glue."

n64,36j026,Steelering,7,Wed May 20 11:25:36 2015 UTC,Its projects like this that make me wonder what a professional dev team could do with N64 hardware without the limitation of late 90s cart capacity
n64,36j026,Steelering,1 point,Wed May 20 07:52:09 2015 UTC,"Eh, I wouldn't say the cartridge is what held games back. Mostly, it's the tiny amount of texture memory available on the hardware and slowness of the Z buffer. Not to say that there couldn't be some clever hacks to marginally increase performance, but the cartridge isn't what held games back.  That's why all the texture packs that make things look buttery smooth on an emulator won't work on hardware. The emulator doesn't enforce the limited texture memory size like on real hardware."
n64,36j026,SolipsistRB,1 point,Wed May 20 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"even if there wasn't much of a ceiling for higher quality textures (although Nintendo might have raised that ceiling in the initial design if the carts had a higher capacity) there would be room for higher quantity of textures to at least allow for more unique levels, etc.  heck, I'm not even a fan of the texture mods for current 64 games, as I tend to think that they tend to draw unflattering attention to the rudimentary polygons more than anything, rather than being a proper balance."
n64,36j026,Eldgrim,2,Thu May 21 01:47:04 2015 UTC,There was already a sequel Banjo Tooie.

n64,36ht9a,munchers65,1 point,Tue May 19 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"Combination of Toy Conventions, Flea Markets, and Used Game Sellers (the ones that don't gouge prices)  Flea Markets are an untapped resource. I went to an automotive flea market in Fredonia, NY for example and saw 12 Xbox games going for $1 each. Nobody knows what they're selling at them.  Used Game Sellers are good to collect rare games, as they base there prices on popularity over rarity (unless it comes under both, like Beast Wars or Indiana Jones). For example, I picked up Daikatana, Track & Field, and Elmo for $8 each which isn't bad considering that according to digitpress's guide are all high in rarity. Yet they sell a copy of Smash Bros. for $25 (and that's loose). You can use their faulty logic to your advantage.  Toy Conventions are tricky, but awesome. You have to know the market very well. For example, I go to an 80s Toy Show every year and have come home with 2 CIB games each time, despite the fact that the n64 is 90s stuff."

n64,36d4dr,manasource123,1 point,Mon May 18 18:04:57 2015 UTC,What happened here? did you have to mod the n64 to play a Japanese game?
n64,36d4dr,Timmy2kx,1 point,Mon May 18 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, but there are actually 3 ways to play Japanese imports on a US system. PAL games have different technical specs so they won't work, but the only difference between US and Japanese games is the back of the cartridge. Gameshark and passthrough devices work fine for conversion. You can also replace the back of an imported game with the back of a game from your region, and finally you can do what I did and get rid of the two tabs on the dust cover inside the system."

n64,3608ik,SynMonger,1 point,Fri May 15 14:25:40 2015 UTC,That's easier said than done since everyone on ebay either sells it as untested or wants top dollar.
n64,35zkr9,lowerfaiths,7,Thu May 14 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"My only guess would be because it saved some miniscule amount of money.  I RGB-modded my N64 and it is indeed easy, but it requires a small video amp.  So Nintendo probably saved some money by eliminating those components from the board design.  RGB has never been an option on American TVs, with very few and rare exceptions, and component-out was not a standard thing on game consoles of that generation.  The N64 does have s-video output though.  I have compared the quality of the s-video picture to the RGB picture on my PVM, and the difference is pretty minor.  S-video is pretty hit-or-miss though, depending on the quality of your TV/monitor."
n64,35zkr9,Steelering,1 point,Thu May 14 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"My only guess would be because it saved some miniscule amount of money.   miniscule per console, but even if it was like a quarter a console to implement, and with 33 million units shipped that's ~ $8.25 million for a feature they probably knew only a super tiny fraction would take advantage of.  Plus, Nintendo was the last to the 5th gen party and knew that they had to play catch up, and they way they did that was to try and keep the console affordable, particularly when the cart based games were a good deal more expensive relative to the cheap CD based competitors.  That being said, if we could go back in time and get rid of the 64's D-Pad maybe we could then afford RGB out, oh and a more robust joystick design."
n64,35zkr9,MrMashedPotato,1 point,Fri May 15 04:45:15 2015 UTC,"Back then, the D-Pad was Nintendo hedging their bets on analog. Regardless of how successful it become, you knew they weren't convinced internally because of the D-Pad."

n64,35zkr9,hylobates_agilis,6,Fri May 15 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"NUS-FRA (French N64) was shipped with RGB capabilities but this was not wired internally.  Apparently, some guys at NOE had thought about it since there is a particularity on the French Market: RGB output was mandatory until the mid-90s on every home video devices (that's why the French NES outputs RGB). I guess this has been dropped short before the release of the N64, thus the RGB circuits were abandonned completely.  Good new about the N64 is that the DAC (Digital-to-Analog converter) is separated from the main chips so it's relatively easy to get back the original digital signal and convert it (S-Video, RGB, even HDMI: check out http://ultrahdmi.retroactive.be/)"

Conker's Bad Fur Day is the fourth on the list. The Mario parties are good, you need smash and Mario kart obviously. Starfox is great and so are the Pokemon stadiums. Diddy Kong Racing is the best racing game. StarCraft is nice. There are so many and I'd recommend going to flee markets and yard sales for nice deals. Craigslist is nice, and eBay bundles are cheap. Amazon has some deals sometimes. Just look around and you'll find some great deals. Good luck and enjoy the greatest console ever created."

n64,35dbpl,pixiestix88,4,Sat May 9 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"If you live in a fairly large city, it should be fairly easy to find a standard colored n64 on Craigslist. As far as games go, it is better to buy them off of Ebay as a bundle. Although you might not save a ton of money this way, you will still save some. Pawn shops can also be a valuable resource for finding games at a somewhat cheaper price. Thrift stores will more than likely not have any n64 games. They have learned the value of these and will typically put them up for auction online. Also, do not get tricked into buying 3rd party controllers, as most of them will be complete pieces of shit. Official controllers will have nintendo written above the buttons."
n64,35dbpl,haybitch7,1 point,Sat May 9 07:27:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah my option here is online. If there are any games/consoles here they are very overpriced.

n64,35dbpl,haybitch7,2,Sun May 10 06:13:13 2015 UTC,Another option is to find some PS1 and PS2 titles at thrift stores and resell those to fund your n64 games. Those are significantly easier to find IMO.

n64,35dbpl,RXRob,2,Mon May 11 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"The expansion pack goes into the little slot on top of the console, usually covered by a little plastic flap.   The original system shipped with a 'jumper pak' installed there that did nothing. They later released the 'expansion pak' which gave the system more RAM.  You can't tell the difference if the plastic flap is on top. If the flap is removed for a picture, the expansion pack looks like this, note the bright-red-with-holes-in-it thing. The jumper pack is plain black.  I highly recommend you get a system with a first-party expansion pack, it adds features for some games and is required to play some of the best games. Stick with the Nintendo ones (bright red), as I've heard bad things about the third-party replacements.  Price Questions: http://videogames.pricecharting.com/"

n64,35dbpl,fn_s0fa,2,Sun May 10 06:13:43 2015 UTC,"First thing to expect, high prices on even the best selling games on the console. The prices of the games on the system run a lot on nostalgia which is why you'll be lucky to find a SM64 or OoT cart for under $25.  Second, any of the see-through colours for the console or controllers are going to run you a premium. You can find the regular black console with jumper pak (or expansion pak, if the trader left it in or something) the hookups and a controller for $50 at the high end. See-through consoles with matching controllers can run you upwards of $100 or more in some cases. Another thing, controllers of any colour will run you a good $20+ if they have a good joystick. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find one cheaper, and expect a lot of ones you come across to have a loose joystick (but they should be cheaper). Solid coloured controllers go for about the same as the grey one, as does the atomic purple since it was a pack-in with a lot of N64's circa 1998 iirc.  As for the expansion pak, it's a requirement for DK64 and Majora's Mask, and Perfect Dark's single player (essentially a requirement). It's just a RAM upgrade. It enhances some graphics of other games too. Those go for about $20+ as well on their own, but like I said before you may be able to come across a console with one already in it for a normal price. Just lift the tab on the front of the console, if the thing under it is red, you have an expansion pak. If it's black, it's a jumper pak, and if there's nothing DON'T BUY IT.  As for the games, Pokemon Stadiums go for a fair amount of money, I'd say $20 for 1 and upwards of $40 for 2, probably nostalgia based for the first one since it sold well... as for Snap, don't pay more than 10, you will likely be able to find it for 5."
n64,35dbpl,kidhumbeats,1 point,Sat May 9 05:50:14 2015 UTC,Thank you for all this info. Only bad thing is most of my purchases will be online due to the fact there is no consoles in my area. If there are they are higher then even ebay prices.

Halo: Combat Evolved for the XBox and F-Zero on the SNES for Mode 7 ""3D"" are also up there  but as far as overall as a launch title I would definitely rank Mario 64 higher"

n64,358czc,Narann,2,Fri May 8 13:19:37 2015 UTC,"Tomb Raider is an excellent reference of what kind of predate Mario 64.  But:   In Mario 64 you often see the whole level from one point to the other. This change the way you navigate through levels. Freedom in TR is quite relative. In Marion 64, you can go everywhere on the provided levels (each place is reachable) while TR often give you an area and you can't really move out. TR was a continious mix between linear progression and exploration (you move from explore/activate levers/move/repeat). Mario 64 was exploration/dexterity. Controls... Prepare a jump in TR in some platform part is like land with a Boeing 747. Dexterity in TR is not natural at all, it's all about placement preparation."

n64,358czc,autowikibot,2,Sun May 10 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"Nobody has mentioned NES yet but I'd put it up there. Super Mario Bros was the first game I remember to feature side-scrolling*. Prior to that every game took place on a single screen frame. It also had Duck Hunt, which was obviously really cool at the time.  Mario 64 does still win out imo though.  *Edit: correction, it was not the first side scroller. I apologize."

n64,355u8f,ikillspacies,1 point,Thu May 7 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"+1. The single biggest issue with N64 emulation currently is that it's rather fractured. Right now it seems to be stuck in the ZSNES ""hack"" phase of emulation, which is a shame. That is not to suggest the software doesn't represent a huge volunteer effort of time, skill, and dedication on it's own, but it is interesting that somehow the N64 was ""forgotten"" in terms of emulator advancement, so we are still working with Emulators that are often functional but have their fiobles and games that don't function properly.   There are still some advantages to emulation, but they still come with heavy trade-offs at least in it's current state."
n64,355u8f,BCProgramming,2,Fri May 8 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"The point is the clearer picture. Most TVs that still have composite inputs treat all signals as 480i, which looks real gross with the 240p signal sent by most N64 games. The TV works to deinterlace video that isn't interlaced to begin with. This also adds a lot of unwanted latency."
n64,355u8f,BabyPuncher5000,2,Thu May 7 21:15:06 2015 UTC,Rgb scart with amp and hdmi converter box at 1080p looks pretty glorious.
n64,355u8f,ericargyle,1 point,Fri May 8 03:37:25 2015 UTC,"Except even the most well configured emulator has like 40% compatibility rate across the whole library.  This lets you get the best picture the system is capable of to an HDTV. It converts the digital RGB signal directly to HDMI, so it is just the ultimate way to connect the system to an HDTV (way better than composite or s-video).  It also allows scanlines to be added, which I prefer for my 240p games because it makes them look better to my eyes.  Combining this mod with an everdrive64 will give you the best experience if you prefer to have 100% compatibility, running on original hardware.  Sure, some games like Mario 64 run flawlessly at 1080p and look fantastic in emulation, and then some games like Turok 2 have the camera placed too low, like you've fallen through the floor, and have weird graphical artifacts, like clipping through objects like walls when you walk up against them to climb them.  There is room for both in this world.  As soon as someone optimizes a low-level emulator that will run like 90% of games without graphical artifacts in HD then I'll be all for it, until then we're stuck configuring multiple HLE plugins, and having projects like the new GlideN64 plugin that was just released last week under deliver..."

n64,355u8f,ewd444,3,Thu May 7 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"No, this chip has to be installed INSIDE the console, attached directly to the ""reality coporocessor"" (N64 GPU) and bypasses the AV out entirely.  Something more like what you're thinking of could be possible for the Gamecube since it had the ability to output an encrypted digital signal through the AV port that was decoded by hardware in the available component cables."

They did a great job with the ports, they look great and play very well.

n64,3528or,dogstarchampion,1 point,Sat May 16 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I've been finding a lot of N64 consoles lately at Goodwills; usually they aren't with the cords so you'd have to look around for them, but overall you could pick one up for about $15 (check the spot with the expansion pack, though; they could cost more with the updated one or less because it's missing completely). Good controllers I've found there are about $10. You're best off going to a flea market if you still want cheap and all the cords/accessories already bundled (and typically guaranteed to work). I knew a couple places in Tampa where you could get the console, cords, and at least one controller for $40.   As for Banjo-Kazooie or Banjo-Tooie... I have to imagine you won't find it cheaper than $50 at a retro game store. Since it's a classic, popular game, it'll probably be hard to find it cheap.  Hope this helps! Good luck! :)"

First level was an introduction level, as most games have.  However, it was pretty boring, I didn't really get too much out of it.  Plus, there were these thing to collect (gold cards), that were impossible to find.  I put the game down.    Came back to it a few months later, beat the first few levels and started loving the game.  As it turns out, the first level's gold cards are very hard to find for beginners, but after playing the game and getting a feel for some of the tricks/mechanics of the game, they are pretty easy to get.    I love the fact that it's a 3D bomberman game, as it brings a new dimension to solving puzzles/problems.  If anyone has considered playing this game, do give it a chance - stick with it until at least halfway through the second world, you'll end up loving it."

n64,34taa6,RainbowsInHell,2,Mon May 4 20:02:35 2015 UTC,Mickeys Speedway USA. one of the best racing games on n64.
n64,34taa6,shakeandsnake,2,Mon May 4 12:05:24 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to pick this one up. It's the only N64 Rareware game I don't own.
n64,34taa6,maxthehumanboy,1 point,Mon May 4 12:20:50 2015 UTC,Highly recommended. I put it above Mario kart

n64,34taa6,SolipsistRB,2,Mon May 4 14:42:30 2015 UTC,Shadowman was absolutely brilliant but nobody I knew ever played it! One of the darkest games ever!
n64,34taa6,Skyline99x,2,Mon May 4 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it counts as 'underrated' as it got pretty good reviews, but Space Station Silicon Valley is one of the best games on the system that most people don't talk about.  It was developed at Rockstar by the same team that went on to make GTA 3 and you can see the blueprints of that game's design in SSSV. It's a totally unique 3d platformer where you play as a microchip that can take over different robotic animals to complete mission objectives.  Aside from the gameplay being revolutionary for the time, awesome  music, fantastic level design and quirky Rockstar humor complete the package. Definitely one of the most solid experiences on the n64."

I liked the concept and the graphics were good but the controls and the gameplay weren't good. It was hard to control, confusing and dull. At least that's what i remember thinking at the time and i was glad that i hadn't spent the money to buy the game because i was looking forward to it from reading about it in the magazines."
n64,34taa6,roxvox,1 point,Fri May 8 20:03:40 2015 UTC,"Ahh. Yeah, I would definitely agree that it's very confusing to navigate. Fortunately my uncle bought it for 10 bucks not too long ago, which is where I played it, on his n64."
n64,34taa6,CrinerBoyz,1 point,Fri May 8 20:14:43 2015 UTC,The controls definitely had a steep learning curve. Fun once you got the hang of it though.

n64,34r6zi,RenaKunisaki,5,Mon May 4 02:55:58 2015 UTC,"Most company's would just go ""yay free advertising!"" But I know Nintendo while making great games also has the biggest stick up their butts when it comes to stuff like this. That being said it's user created content with no footage of game play in any way so I doubt Taco Bell asked. They might have needed permission from the OP of the video."

n64,34s7d7,Newman4185,2,Mon May 4 02:58:30 2015 UTC,You could safely feel you made a good deal at 50. 65 isn't a bad deal on your end it's just close to full market value.

n64,34s7d7,lbbhct,1 point,Tue May 5 22:38:58 2015 UTC,"It's an ok deal. I mean it's a bit cheaper than if you bought then all seperate but I would say it's a steal. It's a great starter, especially if you need the expansion pack"
n64,34s7d7,hijinked,1 point,Mon May 4 02:49:07 2015 UTC,"It's only a good deal if the controllers are official Nintendo controllers in great condition.  Mario Kart is worth about $30-40, the RAM is about $15, the rest aren't worth much."
n64,34s7d7,NGeX,1 point,Mon May 4 10:47:51 2015 UTC,The controllers look very Nintendo.

Last year I bought Extreme G III for the GameCube. It's a fun game, but I really wanted to play the original. The post-apocalyptic tracks and the weapons you can pick up give it a completely different feel.  The stickers came off pretty easy, without damaging the label. It seemed like a weak glue was used."
n64,34ptdx,zeress1,2,Sun May 3 14:50:03 2015 UTC,"The stickers came off pretty easy, without damaging the label. It seemed like a weak glue was used.   That's good to hear. Nothing ruins a nice find like having an extremely sticky tag on the label for me."

n64,34pmev,randomaccnet,7,Sun May 3 12:18:50 2015 UTC,"The Donkey Kong character required a license from Rare at that time, that is why it was added later. Nintendo probably had to demo the game to Rare first before they got permission."
n64,34pmev,john78901,3,Sun May 3 13:42:14 2015 UTC,"Just curious, could you explain more about the license to Rare. I always thought DK was a Nintendo owned character and Nintendo gave Rare permission to use the character to make games for various Nintendo consoles."
n64,34pmev,eDoctor,3,Sun May 3 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"After they (Rare) redesigned DK for DK Country, they owned his redesigned appearance until they were bought by Microsoft."
n64,34pmev,Flab149,3,Sun May 3 19:44:10 2015 UTC,I suspect that Magikoopa/Kamek was a temporary character as they waited for Rare to provide a 3-D model.

Also if you like sports/racing/wrestling games, N64 ones are a few bucks each and has a few gems (really strong WWE, racing, and to some extent Madden/NHL options with a shitload of baseball games). Dirt cheap and fun to have for multiplayer options (which is where the system shines).  As for Conkers, every year I check prices on EBay and feel alot better that i paid 35 for it in college a few years ago (best terrible drunk purchase I ever made, its almost tripled its value).

n64,34k71a,BCProgramming,2,Wed May 6 08:51:14 2015 UTC,"Two workarounds, outside the obvious ""buy a CRT TV""  -Mod the n64. The N64 can be modded to provide RGB output which can be converted to YpPbPr Component output. However I don't think this was entirely straightforward and did require solder work with a new chip component, as I recall.  -use a Scaler. There are a lot of devices that can accept Composite, YpBPr, etc inputs and output an HDMI. This is what I use. It has inputs for composite, component, VGA, and HDMI, and outputs HDMI, which I can then plug into my computer monitor for my consoles. The one I have is a ViewHD box, but I believe the xRGB is more well-regarded.  I'm not a fan of CRTs. typically the argument is that the N64 or other older systems were designed to be used on CRT televisions, so they ""look best"" on them. I think this is less about the system being ""designed"" for it (Most old consoles have a PPU which outputs full RGB that get's downsampled to composite and/or RF) and more about people figuring the ideal way to play old consoles is the same way they used to play them."

So I hand him the money after I feel how heavy the box is, take it home, open it up. There are 3 N64s. Two black and one of the blue ones with pikachu. 4 controllers. Power supplies for all of them along with the A/V cords. They each had expansion packs in them. About 30 games. Notable mention, Donkey Kong 64, Majora's Mask, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Harvest Moon 64 and Beetle Adventure Racing (it's notable because it was my favorite racing game back in the day) so I think for 80 bucks I got a pretty good deal.

Surprisingly, they all work, though SSB doesn't save my progress/unlocks (probably needs a new battery).

No jumper pack, but it had all the cables and stuff.  Two N64 controllers, one black and one gold, but both with fudgy analog sticks that won't fully register in the up direction.  One third party expansion pack (broken though, but it could be the slot it goes into)  A Rumble Pak, a Controller Pak and a Transfer Pack, don't know if they work or not.  Nine games: SM64, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Pokémon Stadium, some Mission Impossible game, Wayne Gretzky's 3D hockey or whatever it was called, Wave Race 64, Killer instinct Gold and Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (I think).  A bunch of instructions, for all games listed there except Wave Race 64, plus some for games we didn't own like MK64.  Might sound lame, but hey! We got it all absolutely free.

Maybe it was damaged somehow or the port on the TV you are using it on is messed up.  Had that happen with a friends TV, we hooked up a Wii to it and it was only black and white with no sound.  Turns out the AV ports on the TV were fucked up.  Got it fixed then they worked perfectly.  Two options to look into at least.  Try another console on the same AV ports and see if it works or not.  If it works fine, then try the N64 with different AV cables on those ports.  It takes a LOT to damage an N64 so I think the board would be fine, cables seem the likely culprit."
