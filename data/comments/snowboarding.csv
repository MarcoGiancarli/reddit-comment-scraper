snowboarding,3e3rie,trojangodwulf,2,Tue Jul 21 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"i personally dont really like fully reverse camber boards in the park since I find they make it a little harder to slot your rail and ""catch"" yourself on harder snow when landing. However, a lot of companies have good hybrid rocker/camber boards now that have the best characteristics of both.  I rode my friends lib t-rice 153 (hyrbrid camber) through mammoths park last year for a couple runs and it absolutely destroyed the jumps (kinda obvious given the name).  I know mervin (lib/gnu) offer almost all off their boards in wides.  An attack banana wide might be worth checking out... not as pricey as a t-rice, but same tech..."

Most likely this place just couldn't compete with the other Tahoe area resorts (Kirkwood, Sierra-at-Tahoe) so they closed up. Just my guess."
snowboarding,3dyqrf,snowbirdie,5,Mon Jul 20 21:03:50 2015 UTC,"I'd totally agree with this.  Iron mountain did close many years ago, but these days its becoming so much harder to be an independent/private ski resort.  It has a lot to due with high costs of running the resort coupled with low snow.  Add in the fact that massive corporations are able to offer season passes to ~10 resorts for the price of a pass to independent mountains.  Ex: Would you rather buy a pass that allows you to ski at Heavenly, Northstar, and Kirkwood or one where you can ski Mt. Rose only for the same price...No matter how sick the resort it makes sense to go with the multipack."

I really like the idea on principle, but would want some ideas on how to do this so we could avoid fraud.  I would hate to see members of /r/snowboarding get ripped off because we allowed this.  If we could come up with a good system I think it is probably something the mods would get behind (I haven't discussed it with them but I bet everyone would go for it)."
snowboarding,3dygnr,akn5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"Fraud would be the only real concern about this. But, what if the payment method is made through PayPal? Don't they offer a money back guarantee?"
snowboarding,3dygnr,akn5,3,Mon Jul 20 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"There's still potential for fraud with a buyer claiming they never received the item or something like that, but I do agree doing PayPal would definitely help reduce the chance of fraud.  Using PayPal, we would generate invoices for the purchases to send to the buyer. This would mean we would have to eat a small fee to use PayPal ($.30 + 2.9% of price) but I'd say that's a pretty good deal. We could also look into Square, but I'm not 100% sure how it works with P2P transfers."

snowboarding,3dxsr0,erm_porter,10,Mon Jul 20 12:26:07 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I used to work in a ski repair shop, so have some advice that might be useful. From a first look at those photos, I can't see anything too bad damagewise. It's hard to tell, but I don't think you've gone through to the core on any of the hits, so it's no problem.  What you really want to prevent is any water getting into the base. If I were you, I would go down to your local ski repair shop with a six pack of beers just after hours, and they'll do it for free.  If you're waxing/tuning your board yourself, I'd suggest buying some PTEX and hitting up those small bashes. For a stronger hold (particularly on that delam/hit on the nose), I would use 24 hour epoxy, a G-clamp and two pieces of wood.   The best reason to wax is that it PROTECTS YOUR BOARD FROM DAMAGE! This is completely separate to the fact it makes your ride smoother. Imagine your base as being like a big sponge. If all of those holes are filled with wax, your board is stronger. If all the wax is gone, and your base is dry and brittle, you're asking for damage.  I used to wax twice weekly, and tune my edges either when it got icy, or once a month."
snowboarding,3dxsr0,etwl18,3,Mon Jul 20 12:34:20 2015 UTC,"or just bring it in during regular hours and pay the $20 to get a simple wax. if someone walked in at closing and wanted to pay me via beers I'd say no, pay me. maybe if the beers were a tip, I'd stay later to work on it right away.  it doesn't look like any of those would really require any P-Tex, maybe the ding closest to the edge, a simple wax should do."
snowboarding,3dxsr0,coleslawed,2,Mon Jul 20 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"In most large resorts, the techs stay in late at night to do rental waxes/tuning - we used to tune the entire resort fleet at night. Tuning someones skis at night for beers was a tip itself."
snowboarding,3dxsr0,etwl18,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"Amazing!  Thank you so much.    Unfortunately, my local ski shop isn't all too friendly.  It's owned by skiers (not saying thats a bad thing) but the past few times I've been in there they've been rather snobbish.  So I'll for sure grab some PTEX and dive in myself.  Thanks again."
snowboarding,3dxsr0,joejance,3,Mon Jul 20 13:49:40 2015 UTC,"If you are going to do PTEX on your own then do yourself a favor and don't get a candle.  A PTEX candle repair seldom lasts that long unless the stars really align for you, and looks ugly.  If you have the cash pick up this $40 iron and some clear ptex string for a quality repair.  I bought one a few years ago and couldn't be happier.  I have fixed some pretty good dings with that iron and some of them are some subtle that unless you are really looking for the repair you won't find it.  Not a single repair I have done has come undone."

snowboarding,3dxsr0,spacegrab,2,Mon Jul 20 13:39:50 2015 UTC,"Your base dings dont look bad. Core isn't exposed. Only the crushed nose/rail looks worrisome - I'd be concerned of water getting in and expanding - will cause your board to delaminate and come apart from within.  If you don't know how to repair, but want it done right, pony up and pay the shop if you like that board.  For tuning - I rarely tune. I'll sharpen my edges maybe once every 50 days ridden on a board. I will however, deburr my edges every now and then if I have any major rough spots on the rail.  For waxing - I only use citrus cleaner if my base is gunky as shit (aka riding Big Bear in the Spring, when you board base turns black from diesel/tree-sap gunk. Otherwise I just hotwax/scrape - the wax/scrape process already pulls shit off your board. Citrus cleaner doesn't exactly clean wax off anyhow, but it's nice to have a cleanly wiped base so you dont cook any debris into your fresh wax.  Never heard of this sharpie tactic."

snowboarding,3dz1q3,ParkwayDrive505,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"My other question is, does what type of board a company specifies it as matter?     Yes. I assume you are referring to camber vs rocker vs hybrid etc. Most companies offer an almost excessive amount of detail about the camber profile of their decks. However, novice riders usually won't notice much difference. You need to be going really fast to notice park boards are less stable, and you need to be getting really radical with your freestyle tricks to notice that all-mountain boards are less flexible.   Your questions really depend on her skill level and riding preferences. Yes, a park board will generally be better for buttering but if she likes to ride steep black diamonds as well then you will be losing some stability with a park board.    Another thing to consider is where you ride. Are you in a consistently powdery area like Colorado? Consider a more flexible board so it's easier for her to keep her nose up in pow. Are you in an icier area like the PNW or east coast? Consider a stiffer camber. But again, she needs to be the type of rider that can make it down a black diamond without falling to be able to really notice these differences."
snowboarding,3dz1q3,angepocalypse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"She can definitely handle her own when it comes to runs. I'd say more in the intermediate to advanced area there, but she wants to get into some park riding and like I said, buttering. We live in New Mexico so it's like a mix of powder and ice depending on where you are in the state. Are there any all mountain boards that have a decent flex?"
snowboarding,3dz1q3,spacegrab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"If she doesn't ride hard/fast, get a mellow rocker board. Easier to ride IMO, and makes powder less strenuous for the uninitiated. Also butter-friendly, but is NOT conducive to bombing runs.  My roomie (girl) rides GNUs - they're cheap(er) but come out of Mervin's factory (libtech/roxy etc)."
snowboarding,3dz1q3,angepocalypse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:30 2015 UTC,"GNUs aren't cheap nor are they cheaper than Nitros. Mervin boards, like most board manufacturers, offer some lower end boards at lower pricepoints, so maybe those are what your roomie has purchased in the past but on average most Mervin decks are more pricey than Nitros."
snowboarding,3dz1q3,spacegrab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry, should have elaborated. I meant to emphasis that GNU is to Lib as Forum is/was to Burton. Same factory, slightly reduced MSRPs (then again Forum product development was often delayed 1yr or so behind Burton).  The nice thing is GNUs can be frequently found in retail shops and online for 40-50% off come spring. Libs/Burtons tend to be around 30-40% off, but at times can be found for 50% as well.  Long story short, OP should have no problem finding a great board considering his pricepoint is just under $300."
snowboarding,3dz1q3,spacegrab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:54 2015 UTC,"No she def. rides hard and fast. And where we live we don't have a ton of powder, that's why it's a tough choice haha"
snowboarding,3dz1q3,D3wdrop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"TBH the board type won't break your style of riding, but makes it harder to do certain things. Like if I butter on my custom-x, my leg is going to wear out SO fast because the board is stiff and poppy. If I use a softer park board, it's going to be way easier. I can do it on both, just not as easily on one.   Powder is mostly affected by size & cut (directional will float a bit better since the tail is designed with less surface area, so it sinks more). But you don't ride that much pow.  As for the chatter that comes with a rockered board - honestly it's not that noticeable until you hit like 40mph. Around 50 or 60 it starts chattering really bad, but its not like I'm going to eat shit and die - it just rattles my feet some and makes me less controlled.  If she rides fast, and you don't have a lot of pow - I'd lean towards a cambered park board that isn't TOO noodled/soft. Just remember, everything runs on a sliding scale - it's not black and white, but a lot of bullshit marketing the companies spin at you.   One of my favorite park boards is an old Burton Tadashi - I can literally do everything on it. All mountain, park, pow - it just suffers a bit with powder & edge control. Like I'd give it a C rating for those two categories. Doesn't mean it sucks - I ride it anyways when I'm too lazy to move my bindings or dig my pow board out of the shed.  In the end, my advice is to just make sure she likes the graphics. I know a lot of people that are particular about their shit :D"

I've been riding my 2012 ride machete for the last few years and I love it, but id like to get something a bit softer and with more flex for jibbing, buttering and general park features.  I've never ridden a rocker board so I'm not really sure what to expect/look for. Not really on a budget but probably wouldn't go for the absolute top of the range."
snowboarding,3dukla,BitsyCupcakes,24,Sun Jul 19 16:56:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. To start a group lesson will be beneficial and fun. You will get the basics from a trained ""Professional"", who can explain the body mechanics behind the why of bending your knees and flexing your ankles a certain way. You will meet others at your level trying to learn the same thing. Group lessons are cheaper than Private lessons.  Private lessons give you one on one time, how ever I find they are more beneficial when you know what questions to ask ahead of time.  Another good piece of advice is to rent your equipment from a board shop in the ski town, not from the resort rental shop. The quality of the product you will get from the board shop is vastly superior to the rental shops."
snowboarding,3dukla,chatrugby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! The resort that's near me is only popular for locals. Not something you would travel cross-country for, so the price difference between group and private is minimal. I think I'm leaning towards private, but you hit the nail on the head, with regards to meeting people via group lessons. If I were to do solo lessons, do you have any basic questions that are good to ask?  The equipment rental suggestion is great, and a few others have suggested the same. I would have not thought of doing that, so thanks!"
snowboarding,3dukla,JohnQuittenton,8,Sun Jul 19 22:38:21 2015 UTC,"I think you'd gain more from a private lesson once you have the basics down, the questions you need to ask of them will arise naturally from your mistakes. Why do I fall when I do x, how can I do y better, etc. Once you have the basics down, you also have the ability to explore more of the mountain than the bunny hill, and with a private lesson, the only person you'll have to wait for is yourself."

I got a lesson (ended up being private by default) and my instructor was awesome and sent me immediately to a smaller black by the end of the day I only wanted to ride the tougher stuff. By the end of the season I was doing glades. And that was only 7 days of riding.
snowboarding,3dukla,chatrugby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:13:36 2015 UTC,"JohnQuittenton said it very well.   I would book 2 lessons.

Try not to put your hands out to catch your fall, that's a good way to hurt your wrists.  It's hard not to do at first though.  Also, falling on flatter hills hurts worse.  When you're on a steeper hill you just fall and slide.  So don't be afraid of the steepness when you think you might be ready for it."
snowboarding,3dukla,UndeadWood,6,Mon Jul 20 12:19:50 2015 UTC,"The only thing I have to add is that if you're completely sure you want to get into boarding is that you might want to buy equipment right away, especially now during the off season if you want a better deal.  This way you don't have to use the shitty rental equipment,  you get more practice with a board you'll use for a longer time, and you would be already financially invested, so you would want to practice more so it's not a waste of money.  That's what I did my first year and it worked perfectly for me.  The group lessons sounds like a good idea too since that way you can meet more people to go with."
snowboarding,3dukla,zmist,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"This was something I thought of especially since it's the off-season, but I was thinking about waiting still, just to get fitted properly. Did your local board shop fit you? Any factors I should/shouldn't look into if I'm buying gear before going? Did you meet some people that you currently ride with? That's the one reason I'm considering group lessons."
snowboarding,3dukla,gatsby365,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"As lame as it sounds, I pretty much just used a board calculator online and then went to the-house.com and bought a package of board boots and bindings.  If price doesn't matter, your local board shop would probably be much more helpful because they can pick out stuff better fitted for you, but do you're research ahead of time still just in case.  I'd go with an all around board so it'd be perfect for learning to ride and eventually some park stuff.  I actually joined a club through my school and met people that way and got lessons through the club as well.  Turns out I had a few classes with some of them and ended up becoming pretty good friends even today still and always hit up the slopes when we're all back for winter break."
snowboarding,3dukla,mr_awesome_pants,8,Sun Jul 19 23:18:48 2015 UTC,This is the worst way you can possibly buy boots and it can easily ruin your whole experience. Don't do it with boots.
snowboarding,3dukla,sheseeksthestars,3,Mon Jul 20 00:24:27 2015 UTC,Gotta second this - the boots are your connection to the board. The whole experience relies on the boots.
snowboarding,3dukla,PM_ME_YOUR_KROKODIL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"I'd highly recommend buying your own boots, renting board and bindings until you're sure you'll enjoy it.  And when you do decide to buy a board/bindings  you'll have a better idea of what you want if you have a little experience.   For boots, don't but online.  Go to a shop and try on every damn boot in the store.  Find the most comfortable ones, and don't be afraid to just move on and try another shop if nothing feels right.  Uncomfortable boots will ruin your day.  Talk to the person in the shop, snowboard boots don't fit quite the same as regular shoes."
snowboarding,3dukla,PM_ME_YOUR_KROKODIL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:26:18 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with the other poster about buying gear immediately. Make sure you want to keep going and can keep improving before you buy gear. Also, try and hit up a local mountain's demo day before buying--that way you can try a variety of styles to get a sense of what you might like long-term.  I had a friend who insisted, INSISTED, on buying gear immediately. He dislocated his shoulder his second time up (on flat ground, going really slow, by running into a sign... I don't even know how it happened) and was out for the entire season, and likely longer because his wife was kind of furious.  So, yeah. Wait to buy gear. The rentals will be fine for your first 5 or 7 times. That's about when I bought a board and bindings from a friend for $100. I think I used it a season or so and then I moved up to a nicer, newer board after a demo day."
snowboarding,3dukla,take_number_two,4,Mon Jul 20 01:21:36 2015 UTC,I'm a snowboard instructor and solo lessons are much better. They might cost a little more but your instructor can focus on what your having problems with instead of a group. And if you think he/she did a good job teaching you then you can always come back for another lesson to pick up where you left off
snowboarding,3dukla,take_number_two,2,Sun Jul 19 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm leaning towards, especially since it's not too much of a price difference at my resort. Thanks for your reply!"
snowboarding,3dukla,maliciousorstupid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"No problem. Just remember like everyone else said, plan on falling a lot because it will happen on your first day. Just don't fall on you wrists. Use your forearms to break your fall instead"
snowboarding,3dukla,Sneakers03,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"I was in the same situation as you and I just started going to the resort near me, renting a board, and taking a group lesson each time I went. When I wasn't in the lesson I was on the slopes practicing. That was a year and a half ago and now I'm not too bad anymore :)"
snowboarding,3dukla,raivynwolf,2,Sun Jul 19 19:25:36 2015 UTC,I'm not alone! Anything you particularly liked/disliked about group lessons? Thanks for your reply!
snowboarding,3dukla,Suepahfly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:26 2015 UTC,It was just a toss up which instructor you would get and some were better than others. At least try group lessons to find a good one you can request if you ever want private lessons. They put you with people of your own skill so your first day with be with other brand new people. It will be really hard at first but it is for everyone and you won't be alone.
snowboarding,3dukla,danger-pony,2,Mon Jul 20 04:35:50 2015 UTC,Depending on where your local mountain is... the rental gear may be shit.    Where are you located?   If you're near a bigger resort - you should be fine with rental gear.. if not - maybe off-mountain is a better bet.
snowboarding,3dukla,danger-pony,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in Upstate New York. The resort is popular to local people, but not something you would plan a cross-country trip for. I think off-mountain rental is what I'm going to go with, thanks!"
snowboarding,3dukla,MySpoonsAreTooBig,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"Been snowboarding for a while now and if I had to choose between private or group, I would choose private, because:   you have the undivided attention of the instructor.  The instructor goes at your learning speed and not at the speed of the slowest student in the group.  everyone in the class is a beginner so you're not going to learn much from your fellow classmates.  not too sure how many beginners take group classes on their own, so finding someone to snowboard with after class will be challenging.   Money isn't an option so you're not too worried about cost. Rent/borrows as much as you can tho when you go. What if you don't like it?   I would recommend a helmet as well as wrist guards too. Ii would also recommend knee pads (like the ones for volleyball) to wear under your snowpants. They're cheap and will save a bit of bruising."
snowboarding,3dukla,danger-pony,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"Never heard/thought of the knee pad idea, so thanks! Yeah, I'm leaning towards private lessons, and you're probably right on someone bringing a friend with them to a group lesson."
snowboarding,3dukla,DeltronZero000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:32 2015 UTC,I loved my private lesson! I went up to the mountain for the first time (26ish at the time) and all of the people in the group class were little kids (oldest looked to be about 13) so I booked a private lesson and had a blast. The instructor worked at my speed and helped me with my problem areas instead of having to focus on a whole group of people's issues.

snowboarding,3dukla,bicycle,2,Mon Jul 20 08:43:57 2015 UTC,I've been teaching snowboarding and supervising lesson programs now for 6 years so feel free to ask me any questions!   I would suggest doing a private lesson in December and the signing up for group lessons after. That way you can get the basics down and practice a bit before you head into a group. This definitely tends to lead to a better experience. Contact your local mountain to find out about availability and whether that is possible. snowboard lessons don't sell as well as ski lessons so it'll likely be just fine!
snowboarding,3dukla,Muddybuddy11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"Was thinking along the lines of something just like that after reading all of these responses! Any questions I should ask the instructor, or resort during/beforehand? Anything to look for in a particular instructor? And since I've gotten different responses on the subject, would you recommend investing in some gear earlier on, or waiting until I've gotten some time on the slopes?  Thanks for your reply, and offer to answer questions!"
snowboarding,3dukla,T_tties,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"I would be clear with the instructor what your goals are (beginner but looking to feel out the sport and join group lessons with at least a novice level). I would ask them to write down what they taught you after the lesson so you can practice on your own (and google if you forget).  Make sure to contact the resort soon and ask them about availability. Let them know your plan and see if it would be okay to sign up for groups after you've taken a private. Also make sure to ask about levels - you usually have to write down your level and you'll be filtered into a group that way. Most hills will allow you to change groups easily but some can be a bit trickier. So you should ask them what level you should be writing down on your form when you register (considering you will be practicing between signing up and the lessons).  Group lessons are a fantastic way to meet friends. Adult groups are seriously some of my favourite to teach cause everyone just wants to have a good time, learn a bit, and make some friends. There's a big social aspect to adult programs and we often grab a drink after the lesson.   In terms of investing in gear, it's really up to you. It is expensive and if it doesn't end up being something you'll want to do regularly, you could be wasting a lot (stick with it if it's hard at first though :)).  With that said, if money is not a worry and you want to stick with it, you might as well get some gear. The quality will tend to be much higher than a rental and you will likely progress faster because of this. I sell snowboards as well so I can make some suggestions for you, I just need to know if you're male or female.   Let me know if you have any other questions!"
snowboarding,3dukla,T_tties,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:29 2015 UTC,"If you take a group lesson, try to take one during the week (not the weekend) and not during vacation-season.  Try to keep the lesson Tue - Thurs, and not during December or March/April.  The groups will generally be smaller in size and you can get more attention (possibly even 1-on-1)."
snowboarding,3dukla,Di-eEier_von_Satan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"Just to add to that, the vibe of week night lessons is way better than weekend. A lot more relaxed and social. Plus there aren't as many kiddies running around."
snowboarding,3dukla,Di-eEier_von_Satan,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"Other then what other people have said, my biggest advice is, don't give up. Snowboarding can be a (very) painful and frustrating sport/hobby. I remember when I first started going I would go alone and got discouraged real easily. I almost quit and gave up but I said to myself that I wouldn't let it stop me. It's going to be hard the first week or so but after that trust me, no matter the pain or frustration, it will all be worth it. Once you start to get down trails without falling and start to build confidence, there is something that clicks in your head, and snowboarding becomes an addiction....in a good way."
snowboarding,3dukla,mr_awesome_pants,4,Mon Jul 20 02:47:38 2015 UTC,When I started out I did a group lesson but didn't seem to get much out of it. It did make me go buy my own gear and next couple times out I took private lessons. Biggest thing is don't get discouraged because the first 3-4 times out you'll fall down alot getting the feel of things
snowboarding,3dukla,peaksix,6,Sun Jul 19 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"You will fall down so much the first few days. Soooo much. Even more than skiing.  But it's so worth it, so keep pushing thru and rip it 😎"
snowboarding,3dukla,peaksix,2,Sun Jul 19 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"My first run, I fell so many times on my knees (I know that shouldn't have been happening), that my knees were practically blue, but the point is to keep trying and keep at it, until you only fall when you do stupid shit that you probably shouldn't be doing, but thats what's fun about it!"
snowboarding,3dukla,aghalide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like the idea of one-on-one, that way they can focus on what you need to work on, rather than just a group, generically.

snowboarding,3dukla,Blonde_Ideas,3,Sun Jul 19 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"I did a group lesson and by the end of the day I was already going down blue runs.

snowboarding,3dukla,PROfessorShred,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"That's actually something I hadn't thought about when considering a group lesson. What else do you believe would make a group lesson more beneficial, since you seemed to really enjoy your experience?"
snowboarding,3dukla,dirtbaggin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:40 2015 UTC,I can't really think of anything else. Have you ever surged or skateboarded? If you have and are decent at one of them I think snowboarding will come naturally to you
snowboarding,3dukla,Dominant88,2,Sun Jul 19 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"As others have said make sure to take some kind of lesson before attempting to go out on your own. The learning curve is a little steep, but once you figure out the basics progressing to things like riding ""backwards"" and spins are much easier than on skies.   The shape of the board can make a big difference in how easy it is to ride. Camber is the traditional board shape and are bent in a way that makes them ultra responsive. I call them the F1 cars of snowboarding, and are best suited for a skilled rider. Rocker boards are shaped in a way that makes it very hard to ""catch an edge"". They almost seem to float and drift down the slopes and make for a much more relaxing ride. However, some find rocker boards don't have enough edge bite."
snowboarding,3dukla,bulldogclip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:27:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info and the link! No idea boards varied in shape that much. Do you have a preference? Multiple boards for different styles of riding?
snowboarding,3dukla,bulldogclip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:36 2015 UTC,"full discretion I work for a shop that sells Burton. I've ridden just about every style of baord and consider myself an intermediate rider - I can go down any run and off jumps just fine, but I'm not doing any crazy spins or flips.   My favorite board is a flying-v shape. It is just relaxed enough that I feel comfortable going over anything at any speed without feeling like I'm about to ""catch an edge"" (when the downhill edge comes in contact with the snow and slams you down). I ride the Nug Flying V, its also 10 cm shorter than a ""standard board"" making it a bit lighter and easier to move around. I suppose the shorter length would mean its not quite meant to be a ""big mountain"" board.   Lots of the Burton boards feature the EST binding system for unlimited adjustment. The bolts to mount the binding are also outside the foot-bed, so you basically stand right on the board for the ultimate feel and increased board flex. This shows how the EST lets you stand on the board vs the traditional under foot mounting system.   I ride the Cartel, because it has a ""hinge"" for extra pop on ollies,  but any EST binding is good."
snowboarding,3dukla,dubious_ian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:56:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with di-eeifer that ""flying v"" is the best all around board shape.  Lots of brands have it, flying v is just what Burton calls it.  Really it's just rocker in the center of the board and camber at the ends/under your feet.  There are so many good brands and boards and there will always be multiple boards that are perfect for you.  If you're looking for suggestions, I'm sure many here would be willing to help."
snowboarding,3dukla,outbound,2,Mon Jul 20 12:42:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely take a lesson. If money truly isn't a concern, then private lessons are better. The ""group learning"" aspect is overrated, and it typically means you'll be held back by others and get less one on one attention. Better instructors are assigned to more expensive products, so you're likely to have a better experience because of that too. However, private lessons are pricey. Out here in Colorado, around $500 vs around $100 for a group lesson.  I nice trade off (if they're offered) is a small group lessons. Some resorts have groups that get capped at 4 students, so that's a nice trade off between the two.  Do not go out and buy gear if you had a good time. As much fun as that sounds, the reality is that you won't know what to get, how it should fit, or what your preferences are. For example, I bought a long, stiff board with boots that were too big for me. I eventually figured out how boots should fit, and that I prefer short, flexible boards. Kind of a waste of money on that setup."
snowboarding,3dukla,trsilverman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly leaning towards solo lessons. The only reason I was debating between the two was for the social aspect that the group lesson may (or may not) provide.   Agree with you on the gear. There's so much variation, and I can research online, but won't get an actual feel until I try out different boards. Appreciate your advice. Thanks for the reply!"
snowboarding,3dukla,ColrathD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I used to be an instructor, although I taught kids. The social aspect is great if you're going with friends.

snowboarding,3dukla,scburton,2,Mon Jul 20 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"Take a group lesson for the first time or two, no reason to pay someone to watch you learn to skate and stand up. When you're ready to link turns and beyond, private lessons are awesome.  Also, look for a resort with ""Terrain Based Learning,"" you'll be up and riding much more quickly than a standard lesson."
snowboarding,3dukla,christh0mas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:09 2015 UTC,"Sadly no ""Terrain Based Learning"" at the one I'm looking at. But did think about the fact that, since I'm learning really basic maneuvers, the instructor wouldn't really know what I'd have trouble fine-tuning. That's a really good idea, thanks!"
snowboarding,3dukla,playswithf1re,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:43 2015 UTC,They've mentioned falling down a lot in this thread but if you've never had any experience snowboarding or sledding I want to elaborate a little more. Be prepared to fall down... With your face. At least for me I ate it so many times and when I got the courage to go down faster and steeper hills I would somersault when I fell hitting my face and tumbling board over head. Imagine scorpion-ing with a snowboard attached to you. I've literally hit myself in the head with my board like that. But... If you can push through a few bloody noses and face-fulls of snow. It's hella fun!

snowboarding,3dukla,stapler8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:44 2015 UTC,"IMO group lessons will be fine. Do a beginner one, ride a few days then come back for a level 3 or whatever you think you're at. As someone else already said the 4 people or less are a good option too.  If you are going to rent gear it will probably be better and cheaper to get it from a shop that isn't affiliated with the resort.  If you want to buy gear I recommend checking out what nitro snowboards call flat out rocker or Rome snowboards call freepop rocker. It means the board is flat between your feet and the nose and tail curve up early to stop you from catching edges. This is what I try to give all beginners at my shop. For bindings just about any medium flex binding from a reputable brand will be fine at first.   The most important thing to buy is your boots. Try on at least five pairs from a few different brands before buying them. Any good shop will measure up your feet and have a good idea what boots will fit you. At my shop we even have a Thing to measure your arch on your foot and sell footbeds to replace the ones that come with the boot. This is the last place you want to cheap out on, a bad fitting pair of boots can ruin your day.  Source: work in a snowboard rental/retail shop and have been snowboarding for 13 years."

I had a second lesson after I had recovered from the first (oh the pain), second lesson only a half day, by end of second lesson I was good enough to ride intermediate runs. I then bought my own board and started going most days. After about 5 days I was doing intermediate runs well (but not fast) and starting to tackle the steeper runs. It took me a good few weeks to get confortable going fast, I lost confidence after a few nasty edge catches.  Once you can turn its all about practise. After 3mths of boarding a few times a week im hooning all over the place. Then once you can snowboard well one way, turn the board around and try switch, its like starting over!"

snowboarding,3dts21,chatrugby,2,Mon Jul 20 01:51:20 2015 UTC,"For that price buy new. The variety of bindings in that range is mind boggling.   If you are looking for a high end model I recommend Burton Genesis, or Union Charger. They will run you a couple bucks more but are new and awesome.  A little less high end are any Drake binding (I love my Drakes), Union Contacts(softer freestyle binding), 390's are good but the Rome toe straps have some kind of terminal illness (I have never seen a Rome toe strap survive actual use).   At the end of the day I would recommend you look at a pair of Union Force bindings, great all-mountain binding. Super solid from pow fields to jibs. The design has not really changed in about 10 years either, so you/they know they hit the nail on the head. (There are plenty of Union haters out there, but keep in mind that I ride about 150 days a year, and my Forces have survived 3 totaled boards, and they keep on giving)."

Forces are solid bindings, but at that price point you can get nicer, more comfortable and more adjustable bindings from other companies. It took them years to fix their horrendous toe strap and toe ratchet. The ratchet now is not as sticky, but the toe strap is still shaped weirdly. I use my Forces on occasion and they are indeed solid and indestructible, but I'd rather ride Cartels. They're just as responsive while being lighter, more comfortable and more adjustable. I have broken parts on the Cartels, but Burton has always taken care of it for free.  In the end, both are decent bindings, however. Cartels feel and ride better (IMO), but are more fragile. Forces are tanks and are probably the better choice for a rider who doesn't want to replace his gear any time soon."
snowboarding,3dts21,chatrugby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:28:52 2015 UTC,"True with the adjustment options, in my experience though the more you can adjust it the more they break, just look at Rome bindings, the most adjustable bindings on the market, and they all break if you actually use them.    Yes it took them years to redesign their not so hot toe cap, but the one they have now works great if you adjust it properly.  Talking about ratchets, the advantage of Drakes is a great binding that can be fixed with Burton parts. Since rental shops carry Burton you can fix a broken ratchet or ladder at any mountain.  I didnt recommend the Cartels or Malavitas cause I dont like them, the highback is too big for my liking. I think that for the same price you can get a nicer binding from everyone else, but at the next price point up, the nicer Burtons and Unions are where its at."
snowboarding,3dts21,El_Zalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"Technine has never been known to make quality anything. It's one of those companies that relies more on image than on the quality of their products to appeal to people.   I don't know about Aussie prices for gear, but for less than US $200 you can buy Burton Cartels  or Union Forces, which most people like and are good for a variety of conditions and riding styles.

snowboarding,3dsncm,angepocalypse,4,Sun Jul 19 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly unless you are riding really slowly, it is almost impossible to hear other riders, or at least notice that their noises are not your own. That's why the rule about riders downhill having the right of way is so important. They can't hear or see you coming so it is 100% on the uphill rider to avoid them.    The only time not having headphones might help is if an uphill rider is out of control and yelling at a downhill rider to avoid him. But if that ended up in a crash it's still the uphill rider's fault for being out of control in the first place."

Subarus are good because of the all wheel drive and ground clearance but are useless without good tires. I lived in Breck for half the winter last year and trust me the tire makes all the difference. I'm not saying you should get studded snow tires unless you still need to be driving in near whiteout conditions but something with a good thick tread will go a long way.

Get some street footy and also find something that makes you unique as a rider.  Use creativity to the fullest because there are just so many great riders out there that it kind of becomes cookie cutter.  Sponsors don't want cookie cutter.

snowboarding,3drh42,angepocalypse,-6,Sat Jul 18 23:12:50 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about being a pro snowboarder. I made this video for a shop down the road
snowboarding,3drh42,spacegrab,7,Sun Jul 19 00:33:02 2015 UTC,"so... why do you want to be sponsored? Free shit? To brag to girls?    I was originally gonna write a much less harsh critique of your video but this comment pissed me off. You have no desire to go pro but you want a shop to just waste money on you?   Your video has ZERO 'wow-factor.' I literally see 10 year olds shred harder than you at every terrain park I go to. Aside from your back-lips and aerials (which are sloppy as fuck) you aren't doing anything that technical, stylish, or BIG.    First advice is obviously to change your attitude if you want to get sponsored. If you don't want to be pro, why should you be comped for your shredding?    If you do decide that going pro is something you want, you have to go bigger, harder, faster, more creative, and more stylish.    This looked like a video you can show your friends and get some likes on facebook, but if you came into my shop with this tape and didn't even express interest in ever going pro I would say what the fuck are you smoking    Remember the whole point of a sponsorship is that when kids see you shredding they look at your gear/stickers and think ""THAT'S THE GEAR I NEED TO BE AWESOME."" You are representing their brand. Why would an extreme sports business represent someone who is apathetic about going into extreme sports?"
snowboarding,3dntvd,peaksix,2,Fri Jul 17 20:00:52 2015 UTC,"Moving your EST bindings takes what, 5 minutes?"
snowboarding,3dntvd,czi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of time. I'm just wondering if the non-EST experience on channel boards is as bad as I've heard.  If it is, I'll take the couple minutes and swap them. If it's not, I'll pay the whopping $12 for a new disc. Not a big deal either way, just wondering."
snowboarding,3dntvd,czi,4,Fri Jul 17 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"I realize now that I answered something completely different, like some kind of douchebag. Sorry about that.  I used old burton custom bindings on a channel board for some time, but eventually the front binding split in two when landing a jump. After that I got EST bindings and they feel much better."
snowboarding,3dntvd,chatrugby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"I own and ride 3 Burton boards. I hate EST, and will only rock non EST bindings. In my opinion they work much better that way too.  The EST created a weird press sensation, where the board bends inside and outside of the binding, but not underfoot where you want it to bend. EST is also heavier and in my experience the hardware loosens more than using a regular binding with adapter plates. You also loose torsional pressure with EST because the hardware is on the outside.  All in all I would go with Burton Reflex bindings if you like Burton bindings, they ride better."
snowboarding,3dntvd,spacegrab,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"When the hardware loosens its fucking annoying. I have to ride with a tool when I use my EST setup.  Also seconding the weird flex. I don't think it's bad per se, but you can feel the outside edge of the est binding flex into the board. When riding flat based, I won't say whether it's better or not, but I do notice I 'feel' the bottom of the board more.  My go-to setup is using reflex (non-est) cartels - I prefer this feel for everyday riding."
snowboarding,3dntvd,GauchoIRL,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:01 2015 UTC,I used an adapter plate for a long time in my un-inc with non-est burton mission bindings. Assuming the technology for the adapter plates hasn't changed much (how could it?) the bindings spun frequently after high impact landing. Definitely recommend just using EST bindings if you have them
snowboarding,3dntvd,GauchoIRL,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm, sounds like the screws loosened and then allowed the teeth to disengage. How often would you re-tighten them?"
snowboarding,3dntvd,revel_systems,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:12 2015 UTC,They were tight. Plates got chewed up over time though.
snowboarding,3dntvd,revel_systems,2,Fri Jul 17 21:46:30 2015 UTC,"Hey OP!  Real quick:  EST: Extra Sensory Technology. Refers to the Burton bindings that go into a Burton ICS board ICS: Infinate Channel System. Refers to Burton snowboards that use the channel system.  I sell these bad boys for a living, and have had the chance to demo a few things. I'll give it to you straight up.  Channel + EST binding (no baseplate, 2 screws per binding per channel) is the only real way of getting the flex benefit the bindings will provide you with. I would recommend you switch out your cartels between the 2 boards.   The Cartels are already a very flexy binding, they work real fun with channel boards especially if you like to goof around. Not as flexy as the infidels though, but at least you can bomb a hill safely.  On the subject of getting a baseplate for your union bindings, it is typically advised as a last resort set-up, putting a non-EST binding on a channel board. Do so only if you need to.   You're better off using EST+ICS. Or baseplate + 2x4/3D/4x4 mounts. Using an EST board with baseplate style bindings is a waste of money on the deck, unless you purchased the deck first and need bindings for everything.  The reason why you don't want to do EST+baseplate is that there's way better boards out there than the Burton Custom for the same price that will outperform it in terms of response, stiffness, P-TEX quality and overall ride feel, by not burton. Burton's boards are becoming too brandy imho. There's better things out there for that price unless you wanna experience an ICS board set-up.  It's the combo that is the threshhold of the value of the set-up. You will be experiencing a very slightly sub-par ride than the equivalent ideal set-up from a combination of 4X4 or 2x4 bindings with better decks, with the added benefit of stance customization over a traditional mounting divot."
snowboarding,3dntvd,revel_systems,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks. So it sounds like by using a baseplate + ICS, I simply wouldn't be utilizing the full potential of the board, rather than anything truly detrimental? I may be ok with that in the short term until I get a second pair of EST bindings.  A couple other questions if you don't mind:  Out of curiosity, what boards would you say would perform better than the Custom if I was going to use traditional bindings? I know Burton and K2 boards well, but haven't had the chance to try much else.  Also, do you have any opinion on Burton Mission EST bindings? They're slightly cheaper than the Cartels, and wondering if they're decent bindings on their own. If so, would you say they match up better with the Custom or a Nug?"
snowboarding,3dntvd,revel_systems,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"You are correct. You simply will be missing out on potential with an ICS and baseplate. Nothing more. If anything, you still have the benefit of adjusting your bindings with such detail.  For companies might i recommend Trapper if you want something real fancy, Ride if you want upmarket K2, GNU if you want the best of what tech Mervin Manufacturing has to offer.  Might i also really suggest YES Snowboards if you really liked the feel of your Burton Custom. YES Snowboards are basically old burton employees who split off to do their own thing once burton started going all coca-cola.  Look at http://www.the-house.com/helpdesk/snowboard-sizing/ to figure out what you need. Pay most attention to Directionality and Profile shapes. Stiff for speed, soft for park. Directional for all mountain, Twin for Park/Freeride. Camber for ultimate carving and pop in ollies, Rocker variants for easy goofing around and butters and easier landings.  Bro, look at all them brands with your new found knowledge. Then gimme a list of what you like to do on the mountain and which boards you've chosen and i'll tell you which to go for.  Bindings are a lil bit more simple. You want a good quality footbed, Softer flex for park/freeride and stiffer for carve. Most importantly you need good buckles. Ride's astroglydes and burtons signature one-piece buckle (when it's metal) are legit. Option are gorgeous. I don't recommend flow unless you're a park junkie or live by a very small hill, they have way too much slop for speed.  Boots: fuck everything. Whatever fits you the best is the best boot. Other than that, stiffer for heavier people (+200lbs, get stiffer boot, >5 stiffness rating) or for maximum carve control, softer for freeride/park.  BTW: freeride the way i'm using it here usually involves those people who do tricks while they ride, butters, presses, jumps and 180s all day long while they go down the mountain. Not sure if i'm using it correctly so feel free to correct me on that, i'm not familiar enough with north american snowboarding culture yet.  Cheers bud. Love this sub in the summer, it makes my day!"
snowboarding,3dntvd,revel_systems,2,Tue Jul 21 06:27:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I guess I should give some background on myself. I used to be an instructor and I know all about different ride tech. I've owned as long as 158 (a Custom X) and as short as a 146 (my current Nug). Also had a 152 K2 world wide weapon, 156 K2 Turbo Dream, and 156 GNU Carbon Credit. I definitely prefer shorter, flexible playful setups. My Nug is my favorite so far.  Currently I only own the Nug, and with only rocker, I miss the edge hold. Which is why I want a Camber board (my WWW, Turbo Dream, and GNU were all flat or rocker). Most of my riding is in the trees / back bowls. Not any true ""back country"", but I like doing little cliff drops when I can. Also a bit in the park. Not much jibbing, some jumps. Starting out in the pipe as well (which is super fun).  I ride switch a decent amount, and I'm not a huge fan of the feel on directional twins, so I definitely prefer true twins as well.  For bindings, I've owned a pair of Flux RK30s which were great, but super soft. Also have the Union Forces, which I am not a huge fan of, for various reasons. Mostly because all the adjustments tend to loosen on me frequently. My Cartels are great, and all in all, I feel like Burton bindings have been the best value, no-nonsense bindings I've ridden yet.  Boots: 32 Lashed. Fit me perfectly. I'm good there.  So as far as the Custom, i'm looking at a 2013 Custom Restricted, which I'm getting for nearly half price of retail. It's also a true twin, 151, camber, and has a sweet graphic. It seems like exactly what I'm looking for, and it's only going to cost me $290 USD, so I imagine it would be hard to find something comparable in that price range."
snowboarding,3dntvd,mouthofswords,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:29:51 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track then. You're more than familiar with all the board techs and why things are the way they are.   Just keep in mind a camber board tends to not have a much float as a rockered shape variant. Something super ideal for a bit of everything would be rocker on the nose and camber throughout. I think Ride makes some of their boards like that, havent checked in a while now though, i don't remember.  What size of mountain do you go on regularly, and if it's not a big mountain, do you get out to big mountains ever? Pretty much the only thing now to dictate what to go for.  If you're having trouble with hardware coming lose, try using clear nail polish in place of loctite. Been using this on my baseplates for many years, it always works like a charm!  Cheers bud!"
snowboarding,3dntvd,c_step6,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah, I live in Colorado, so I get a season pass for Breckenridge, Vail, Keystone etc. Definitely big mountains. That being said, I don't ride a ton of powder since I have to drive 1.5 hours (maybe more in a snowstorm) and usually end up missing out on first tracks. So float isn't a huge concern. And my Nug has been good enough for those types of conditions. If I'm going to have multiple boards, I don't mind having a specific use for each one. In other words, I'm fine with having a rocker board and a camber board, and skipping a hybrid profile."
snowboarding,3dntvd,scburton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting! If you don't mind however, have you had any hybrid shaped boards that mix up rocker and camber? Or just flat-rocker variants?"
snowboarding,3dntvd,Legolihkan,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:56 2015 UTC,"No, I haven't owned any. But I've gotten to try out a friend's for a run here or there. But not enough to form a definite conclusion.  My main complaint with rocker is the contact point in the middle ends up feeling very loose and unstable. With flat, I like having a bit more contact along the base. With something like Flying V, the contact point in the middle was balanced out a bit by the additional contact points near the bindings, but in my limited experience, wasn't enough for me to choose it over camber.  If you're getting one board, it might be a good choice, but it felt like a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" type thing."
snowboarding,3dntvd,dubdad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"you are absolutely correct with the ""jack of all trades is a master of none"" when it comes to decks.   It is 100% better to have 2 different decks for different purposes than to try and get a little bit of everything.

snowboarding,3dntvd,dubdad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on how old the plates with the unions are, they could be est ready. If that's the case they should be fine. I rocked contacts on my Burton last winter and they were fine."
snowboarding,3dntvd,TheShyte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the est binding will be lighter and you have more board feel underfoot than compared to other bindings that have more material in contact with the top sheet.

The adjustability factor alone is worth it, but the best part is the added flex without having a disk."

snowboarding,3dn95b,orbzome,6,Fri Jul 17 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"one caution on moldable liners is that heat molding them can lead them to ""pack out"" a bit early. If you can tolerate breaking boots in by just riding for a few days and the hot spots go away you'll get a longer life out of your boots. That being said, if they're really bad, just go to a shop and mold them if you don't think they'll break in too quick."

snowboarding,3dn0vu,Irahi,3,Fri Jul 17 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"So you really want minimal rocker.  Consistency comes from stability, so you'll want at least flat underfoot with a little bit of upturn at the tips as a concession to jibs.  Capita is pretty well known for that particular profile, I'd probably pick an indoor survival for you.  Also remember that the more camber you've got in your deck, the easier it's going to be for you to transition to larger features, but it will make jibs a bit less forgiving."
snowboarding,3dn0vu,Irahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:04 2015 UTC,Wow thanks! I'll take a look at Capita. What is the benefit to having camber then? By saying that camber will make jibs less forgiving does that mean its going to be harder to jib around?
snowboarding,3dn0vu,Irahi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"Camber increases stability by another order of magnitude.  Larger features are all about consistency, the more stable you are approaching a lip at high speeds, the less likely you are to slip and die.  Most high level park riders are on camber all the time for the power and stability it provides.  On the flipside, camber is more punishing.  If your riding isn't on point, if your presses aren't locked in properly, it will let you know and it will throw you."

I loved Fernie it had a great runs and good snow but the park is not quite as good as other places. Panorama has a better park and still gets the consistent snowfall. If looking for steep and deep hit up Revelstoke, or kicking horse. If you want a more touristy place go shred whistler. over 8000 acres and 3 parks and 2 pipes to play in. The runs are good but the snowfall is not very consistent. Other places to ride in BC are big white, Kimberely, whitewater, red mountain, and silver star."
snowboarding,3dmdb1,theguywholikeswinter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"Panorama relies a lot on snow making.  Kimberely doesn't have any steeps.  Red is okay, more geared towards skiers.  Here in Fernie we are just starting to have management stop being terrified of park features on the mountain.  Years ago someone was either paralyzed or killed in the park and RCR shut it down right away out of fear of a lawsuit and the parents never filed for one.  It is a shame because after a year like last, or just a dry month, you need something to draw in tourists.  I know people who would drive from Edmonton to Lake Louis for the terrain park."

snowboarding,3dhtfn,OurSaviorBenFranklin,3,Thu Jul 16 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"I worked a season near Hopfgaten where most seasonaires were English or Dutch. Work was easy for me to find, I just found a lodge on hostelword and sent them an honest email in summer about myself eg. ""Even when i am extremely hungover running on no sleep I am very punctual and still have a smile on my face"". The said they didnt have any work at the moment but about a month before winter emailed me and offered me the position. I literally had the best job in the Tyrol, I had to make up rooms when guests checked out which may be 1 or 2 rooms every other day taking probably half an hour. Help serve dinner (washing dishes is the best because when your done your done. Working the bar is the worst because you have to stay there all night) And i got to guide the guests when they asked. The best thing about my job was the guys i worked with were avid skiiers so we would be on the mountain everyday at 8-9am and explore the countless mountains in the Tyrol. I actually became pretty good at sniffing out hidden gems and the best terrain which you can do being a 'local'. Being a guide is a pretty sweet job but you need to know the place pretty well. The other guys in the area i was in were way overworked, had little to no mountain time and just spent everynight after work drinking because it was the only time they had to themselves. There were girls that after 5 months still didnt know how to snowboard. So my advice would be to try find a cruisy small hotel position or just save up and dont work the entire winter. Do not work as an instructor and i probably wouldnt work a restaurant or bar job either. I can give you the name of where i worked if you want and you can email them to see if they will be hiring this winter?"

Ideally I want to spend a season in Switzerland and ride with my old head chef but he's suggesting that to get any type of work visa as an American or working under the table would be pretty tricky. Austria is my next point of interest as there's a restaurant in a ski village that I'd love to work at (I'm a cook). Do you mind me asking about where you're from and your experience getting a work visa? Or was it under the table? Is it hard to get by without knowing German?"

When i was in Germany i attempted to get a working visa but it became too hard so i just winged it. I think a lot of the places dont really check your working status but where i worked the guys had to pay a sort of seasonal workers tax so you are officially on the books. It really isnt a problem at all unless you are flying out of germany or switzerland where they have been known to look at your arrival date stamps. You definitely do not need to know German, as i said, most people will be English and Dutch. But in saying that, my German friends from Hannover, (the city of the proper German accent) had a really hard time communicating with some of the Austrians due to the thick accent. If you want i can put you in contact with some guys that let people stay at their lodge with free food, accomodation and travel to the slopes in exchange for work if you were interested?"

I work at a small hill but in a large population center. The majority of my day is spent riding the slopes. I did not however make a lot of money, but that's because I choose to take runs over to do lessons (we get paid by the lesson). I do know some people who did take it seriously tho and did make some decent money. Basically if you wanted to make more money you could, but If you would rather do a lot of riding, you could also do that."

Considering your wife already has a few days of experience, I suspect she'll outgrow it very soon. Spend an additional 50 bucks and you'll get her something that will last her longer and help her to progress on the longer term as well.   I'd go for a soft to medium flex hybrid camber or rocker. For bindings, I have good experiences with Burtons. Something like Scribes (or maybe Stilettos if you're on a tighter budget) would be fine.   Did you already buy boots? If not: get them first! A less ideal board is annoying, but bad fitting boots are hell."

Though I do think something really flexible isn't really ideal for a beginner board but I guess whatever you're into.  Lots of flex but no inclination to pop just means she's going to be like a bucking bronco on choppy terrain.  Definitely go with mid flex.  More expensive, but I think the Gnu Ladies Choice is a great board to grow with.  Stiffer than a park board but rocker design (or hybrid? Cant remember offhand).  Update: Actually I just looked up the Burton Genie and you might be right.  Never seen a board thats directly marketed to people out for the first time before."

snowboarding,3djrb7,IseeNekidPeople,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"The most important purchase is not your board, but your boots.  You should spend the most amount of time trying on multiple pairs of boots to compare fit.  If your boots are uncomfortable or sized incorrectly, you won't get the most out of your riding, regardless of what board you are riding.  As for bindings, a reference point is to spend $1 per pound that you weigh (based on the retail price, not offseason sale price). This is not a rule, but rather a starting point, as price tends to correlate with stiffness in bindings.  A heavier rider usually needs a stiffer binding to handle the extra force being transmitted from the boot to the board.  The type of riding that you plan to do is also a factor to consider.  If your plan is to ride park, pick a more flexible binding.  If you just want to ride fast/ freeride, go for a slightly stiffer binding.  As for brands, I've always liked union/ flux/ rome/ ride.  Go for a traditional strap-in binding, not a step-in (i.e. flow)."

snowboarding,3dd9jz,omniamorous,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"If you can ski, you're better off doing that.  Up until last season (took it off just to play) I had been a snowboarding instructor for 12 years, but the work has really dropped off the last couple years.  There are too many good snowboarders, and not enough people who care to take lessons.  Especially as there's still this very prevalent idea that you can learn snowboarding from your gaper-ass friend who will take you for one run on the bunny-hill before abandoning you at the top of a black diamond...  But I digress.  I've been skiing since I was a little kid (prior to discovering snowboarding), so I got certified in that as well, but if I wanted lessons it would always be on skis.  It helps that most schools will start kids much younger on skis than they will on a board, which I fully agree with, but it does mean there's less demand for us boarders.  The mountain I worked at ended up laying off almost all their exclusively-snowboard-teachers last season, and while that was mostly due to conditions, it gives you an idea of where the market is trending in that regard.  There are other great jobs on the hill that will give you plenty of ride-time, but if you're wanting to teach, you may want to invest in some different gear, or at least be decent on them, so you can put that on your application.  Being able to teach both makes you a great resource though, because you never know how many of each sport are going to buy lessons each day."

Bar work (the hardest to get), hotel reception (a mix of early and late shifts is possible), bellboy, houseboy, etc, server and kitchen work.   The reason for that is that you get sooooo much more time on the hill. A lot of people go for lifty or ticket office jobs but by definition the working hours are during skiable hours. If you're working 30 hours a week that's 30 hours you can't go out. Whereas if you're doing some late shifts you can ski before and go out at night if you've got an early."

Your muscles break tissue every time they're stressed landings carving etcetera, they take time to heal that's how you get as stronger. Snowboarding is a pretty intense sport especially if you do a ton of park riding. It's almost like doing squats all day long at the gym, eventually you'll have to drop to a lower weight.   My best advise is to take breaks if you find yourself being sloppy, there's no reason to push and you could get hurt. Training some cardio and leg lifts in the off season will go a long way towards improving your snowboarding."
snowboarding,3dcptv,octocopter1,12,Wed Jul 15 06:37:21 2015 UTC,"I usually get a ""golden"" period around lunchtime when I've worked out all my sloppiness from the morning but before I get too fatigued in the afternoon...doing basically the same thing all day will make you lose focus as well as tiring your muscles out. My usual riding buddy likes to go all out on our last run of the day but I'm the exact opposite, play it super safe because I know I'm worn out."

snowboarding,3dcptv,fancyclancy95,4,Wed Jul 15 16:58:34 2015 UTC,"Conditions are worse later in the day.  Groomers start out nice and smooth in the morning which doesn't require much edge angulation at all to keep from catching an edge.  Once the afternoon rolls around those smooth groomers develop some serious roughness, and any time there's an inconsistency in the snow, you'll have to have greater edge angles to avoid catching an edge.  Think of it in terms of height, smooth groomer means your downhill edge only needs to be an inch off the snow.  Add a 3"" bump to the groomer, and suddenly you need 4"" of clearance instead of 1."

I've now started going to the gym and to the local fridge more regularly. I hope that'll give me some more endurance.   My advice: take a good break every now and then, don't expect too much of yourself after a few hours of riding. Don't try anything new in the afternoon - just cruise around and enjoy being on the mountain (and/or drink a beer)."
snowboarding,3dcptv,Gaeli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:00:02 2015 UTC,About the same level of experience and I get this too. Not sure if tired or low light. It's probably a bit of both. I'm getting some better goggles for next season to see if that helps
snowboarding,3dcptv,Br0biWan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:18:29 2015 UTC,You can definitely train during the off season to get your legs ready.   Squats with weights does the trick for me as well box jumps.  I usually hit the gym and do nothing but squats a week before a big trip.    You may also want to take a lesson or two with an instructor.   Skidded turns takes more out of your legs compared to carving your turns.
snowboarding,3dcptv,ekb18c,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:55:38 2015 UTC,"Just like any other exercise, a little stretching and a warmup run or two can help mitigate getting tired. Also, make sure you're snacking and drinking tons of water ( Especially at elevation)"

But I usually don't find my skills degrading that quickly, you might be making it harder on yourself by not using proper technique. Without the proper weight balance and pressure forward, you will tire yourself out very quickly. I am a level 1 AASI Instructor and I see it in my students all the time. Make sure you have more weight shifted forward on your tip, and you really twist and flex the board to turn. What level of riding are you at."

snowboarding,3dd8hq,SlothsArePimpin,3,Wed Jul 15 10:34:11 2015 UTC,Danish guy here. I was in Whistler this winter actually. It all depends on when you get there. I had an insanely hard time finding accommodation. I moved 6 times in 7 months because i couldn't find anywhere permanent. Get there as soon as you can (september-oktober) to find a place to live. Maybe find a place for a couple of weeks or a month on Airbnb or similar and then find something more permanent when you get there. It's very expensive to live in Whistler (i had friends who paid 800-900$ a month for sharing a room) If you are on a budget you should get a job for the mountain and get a free pass (1800 or so $) and get accommodation through the mountain which is a lot cheaper. They have a job fair in the middle of October or so. It's not hard to get a work visa but it takes a couple of months or so to get so apply for it as soon as you can. It's near impossible if you have DUI's but i was still accepted with a criminal record (graffiti). We had the worst snowfall in 30 years but it's still the most beautiful and best experience i have ver had. Amazing place Whistler is and i wish you the best trip of your life (with hopefully more snow) i am thinking about doing it again at some point. Please pm me if you need any help!
snowboarding,3dd8hq,boessetoemreren,2,Wed Jul 15 21:30:49 2015 UTC,Cant comment in whistler but do you have an arrival date? This will impact on the advice you recieve. In my ski town experience the better jobs are landed when you are in town rather than before you arrive.

This year I'm looking to get my own gear and go a lot more. I'm not looking for amazing quality, just something that gets me down the mountain in a good way. My level is probably a mix between newbie and intermediate at this point. I want something that doesn't break the bank but at the same time I can enjoy a couple of seasons with it.

snowboarding,3ddcqx,QAZZY10,5,Wed Jul 15 17:21:44 2015 UTC,Skip all of that and head over to whiskey militia and pick up a board and bindings. You can find stuff so cheap right now.
snowboarding,3ddcqx,rerunaway,4,Wed Jul 15 18:37:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, both of those look fairly terrible, OP. As well, you want to buy this stuff in person for the most part as all of the equipment (especially the boots) need to suit your body and style. If anything, buy a cheap board, bindings and everything else but spend some money on a solid pair of boots that are comfortable and heat moulded."
snowboarding,3ddcqx,El_Zalo,3,Wed Jul 15 19:20:26 2015 UTC,"Don't buy boots as part of a package. And don't buy cheap boots. Go to a shop and try every pair they have until you have as close to a perfect fit as you can get. Shitty and/or uncomfortable boots WILL ruin your day snowboarding. If buying good boots means you can't afford to buy the board and bindings, so be it. Get the boots anyway and rent the rest of the gear for another season. Having boots that fit you well and have broken in around your own feet are going to make all the difference."
snowboarding,3ddcqx,Gaeli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"Buy nice fitting, high quality boots first. If you've got some money left, see if you can get bindings and a board second hand for a nice price. Only once you've decided what kind of riding you'd like to do (park, pow, etc.) and know the conditions in your resort, I'd start looking for something new."
snowboarding,3dd1ir,Dead_devotion,4,Wed Jul 15 08:56:59 2015 UTC,"Umm... new boots? Seriously though, are the liners removable? If so, get new liners. If the liners are not removable, my guess is that the boots are really cheap and not worth trying to save.  Most snowboard boots are very poor quality. Second hand boots would be even worse. Boot fit is the most important and overlooked part of snowboarding gear. You have to try on several pair and even when you find one you like, you walk around the shop for 30 minutes to make sure."

Try thicker socks? Or you just may need to get new boots. I had a pair of 32-30's, a much loved brand, that no amount of molding, breaking in, or padding could stop them from creating a pressure point on my ankle. Some times a certain boot just wont work on a certain foot."
snowboarding,3dd1ir,I_am_Bob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:44:57 2015 UTC,"Is there anything we could do to stop this?   Get her properly fitted with new boots. Boots are the part of the setup that impacts comfort and control the most and should not be skimped on. You don't want to wear boots that have been broken in while being worn on somebody else's feet. It sucks to have to pay full price on an expensive item if you're on a budget, but her snowboarding experience will be much much better if she has good boots that fit her well. Trying to cheap out will result in pain, frustration and in spending even more money replacing shitty boots for decent ones."
snowboarding,3dd1ir,El_Zalo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"Never. Ever. Save on boots. Go to a store, try 5-10 different pairs on (go with feeling, not what looks best) and then have the store heat mould them when you decided to make the purchase."

snowboarding,3d8qsx,ThePineal,2,Wed Jul 15 04:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'd day it depends on what it's like when you're there, though with the right layering a shell jacket should be fine, assuming it's got a good waterproof/breathability rating. my coldest winter at Winter Park ny main jacket was a shell.

If it's not terribly windy but really cold, sometimes I'll wear almost no layers (just a baselayer), and wear an insulated shell (down puffy).

You added complexity for cost that the large majority of the market won't appreciate.  But I think you presented it well and can defend your design.

Honestly the fact that I ""don't need to wear one at steamboat"" is a stigma I would like to do away with. It takes a small avalanche to kill you, and those can happen anywhere.

snowboarding,3d6x11,rkim,4,Tue Jul 14 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the effort but I probably wouldn't opt for one myself. The ability to transition to a hoe is great, especially when I'm the primary digger in a team and just need to chop through debris as fast as possible, but having a grip of some sort at the top of the hoe blade is pretty dang important for that.  Having the hoe attachment knob sticking out all the time would also make it harder to stash. I carry as small a pack as I can depending on the objectives, and do my best to make sure everything just slides straight out my bag cleanly. That extra extension would definitely get in the way there.  Finally, this is my preference here, but I personally use T-handle shovels as they're generally lighter, and allows me to strap the handle in the ice axe carry on the outside of my pack if (I'm not carrying an ice axe).  This is what I currently use:  http://www.backcountry.com/backcountry-access-dozer-hoe-shovel-with-d2-ext-blade  The monopod function is pretty neat though"

snowboarding,3d6x11,bUrdeN555,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:31:05 2015 UTC,I have nothing to contribute about design/usability but just wanted to say your marketing materials are fantastic.  Great design/colour and quality.  I work in advertising so that's the first thing I noticed :)
snowboarding,3d6x11,spacegrab,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"Cool design, but the presentation video needs some work. I didn't even finish it, felt really disingenuous to have you looking off to the side and reading from a script.   This is your passion and your work. Your sweat and tears went into making this. You should be able to look me in the eye and talk to me about it without fumbling over your words."
snowboarding,3d6x11,joejance,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"I only have a Burton AK Shovel. Not exactly the best.  The reason I like your shovel is, while inserted into my pack, it can double as a monopod mount. One of my favorite GoPro views is to use a telescoping pole as a mount to film from my backpack while I ride. Gives a good angle. Problem is the pole sometimes rotates if I eat shit and requires a lot of bungies to secure. Using the shovel, looks like it won't move much. But then I can't rotate the angle forward so I dunno, might be better for my skier buddies to use."
snowboarding,3d6x11,Sultan_of_Slide,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:58:33 2015 UTC,I like the general concept.  A couple of additions you might consider:   The selfie-stick mode should have a wrist strap.  I don't want to lose the handle of my shovel. A snow saw integration would be super rad.

I'm critiquing his product. If you design things and can't handle being told it's crap, you have no future. Everyone's designed an awful lot of crap.

snowboarding,3d7317,TheBrownSalamander,2,Tue Jul 14 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"go up to valle nevado, el colorado and la parva. It's three very nice hills that are connected, but operated by different companies. each has their own thing and is better on some days. el colorado for park. valle nevado for pow and awesome runs.   There are apartments you can rent at el colorado. you can look into finding someone with an apartment with some room or rent one your self and try to rent out extra space. i can put you in touch with the property manager there. otherwise you have youth hostels in farrelones which is the closest actual town to the ski hills but there is a ski lift nearby that takes you up to the hill (i think) either way, its easy to get to. i think they're 20-40 a night.   no idea for board rental though"

Another shop that is barely hanging on is Northwest Snowboards in Tacoma Washington.  Opened by the Cummins family (Matt, Temple, Mike, Joe & Cherylin) the early 80's.  They have already had to cut their shop size in half, and will moving from Tacoma to Belfair in the near future in order to cut down costs.  Matts other endeavor (OneBallJay wax) is located there so it makes sense.  This will leave everyone in the area no real choice but to order online.  There are a good number of snowboarders in this area who are bitching about this move, but if they had only put their money where their mouth is the shop wouldn't be in such a position.  It isn't uncommon to go in there and be able to talk snow with Matt or Temple, or to buy a deck and have it gripped by Joe, aka the General.  I'll be making the trek to Belfair to buy my Lib MC kink 25th anniversary deck because I bought the first one (which I still have) at the Tacoma shop, from Matt himself.  It's going to be a real bummer when they have to inevitably close shop for good.  Moral of this hastily written response?  Support your local shop.  In my opinion it's worth it to pay an extra $20 to get your gear from a real live person."
snowboarding,3d6gjr,stg58,3,Tue Jul 14 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"I spent all my snowboarding money at SnoCon. I see Adam and John around town now and again. A.G. really is a bad motherfucker and it's cool to have gotten to know him a little bit. He did some solid shit for his SnoCon folk by bringing a lot of them with him to Mervin. Not every store or every owner has that opportunity - it's through the wealth of knowledge and skill obtained over twenty years in the business he and John put together that I think afforded him that ability.   Anyhow, as /u/stg58 said: SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BOARD SHOP!   Support local whenever you can, really. Amazon, Walmart, and all the big chains are killing our mom and pop shops left and right. There's an Adam or a Temple or a Cherylin in every damned town and every industry out there struggling to keep their doors open."
snowboarding,3d6av4,Higginside,5,Mon Jul 13 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"Not done Mt. Cook but I'll tell you what I have done and you can decide to try it or avoid!   I've done 2 cheaper heli days in the Queenstown area.  http://www.queenstownsnowcats.com  They heli you up and down and then use a snowcat to shuffle you between the runs. Decent terrain but a bit short and probably not so good if you are a heli ski veteran. I liked the guys a lot though and they did a great job.  http://www.alpineheliski.com/Packages/Freeride-Heliski-Packages/  Was not what I expected but was still decent. First there were so many people! Like 100! Everyone is shuffled up to the peak and then you do your first run down to a staging area on mountain. They tell you the area to stay in and you ride the same area all day unguided. To be fair I did 6 runs and still found fresh tracks so they know what they are doing. Everyone is ferried up from the valley floor to the peak and finishes their first run so there is a fair amount of downtime. Then they shuttle the groups from the staging area back to the peak and so it goes faster. You pay a base price and then add on for additional runs. My group was cool and I had a blast.  Now though I would pay more and not cheap out for a full proper heli trip. You can check any of them I am sure they are all decent Harris Mountains, Southern Lakes etc. If you can risk it they all should offer last minute discounts to fill the choppers so keep that in mind. Check late afternoon / evening before.  http://www.powderhounds.com/NewZealand/Heli-skiing.aspx"

snowboarding,3d6av4,oneupthespout,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:36:25 2015 UTC,Argh bummer. Thinking about doing the freeride heli now haha. If theres that many people do you have to wait long for the chopper to pick you up? Also good terrain?
snowboarding,3d6av4,xH00CHisCRAZYx,2,Wed Jul 15 10:45:56 2015 UTC,"I think if you can get a last minute deal for a full 6 run heli day it will be the best bet. Even 4 runs. You will have longer runs, be guided and probably go to different areas or at least different routes. If you have powder and off piste experience and are of a decent level.   For the free ride day the terrain will likely be different than what I did. I think they said they have about 6 areas that they use for the free ride days and they will choose depending on conditions and which have been filled in etc.  You get into groups of 6 at the valley floor. There was a big delay at the start so don't be in a rush to be first up. Then a delay after the first run as you wait for the other groups to finish their first run as everyone is coming up from the valley. So it might even be lunch time before your second run. After that it goes quickly as some people only do 1 or 2 runs and you are now just being shuttled to the peak / start point."

And public lane on Palmer doesn't open until 10, and the snow level is to the point where you have to walk about 100 yards to the bottom of the lift.  Unless you want to ride midway, in which case you wait in line with ski racers until about noon.

If your comment was written thinking we go down and go on the hill not on the private areas than excuse me for my bad writing on the main post and I'll edit it.  If not, I would really like a link to where it says credibly that for private HCSC campers, the two tow ropes are inaccessible and we would have to either hike or ride in the non-private areas.

The lap park isn't lappable anymore either, and the vein it used to be in is now timberline public park (also hike only).

Before you drop into the run, you tense up, it's natural, you're nervous because you're pushing your limits. When you drop your shoulders down your whole body is more relaxed, and you ride better.  This works at all levels of snowboarding too. I still consciously do this before I drop into a big line and it helps me ride better."
snowboarding,3d42pa,rabbyt,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:11 2015 UTC,"Cheers, great advice. Yep I was nervous as fuck going on to blue when I saw the gradient change. Heel to toe seems to be hardest, feel like I'm gonna face plant! I'll keep loose next time."
snowboarding,3d42pa,rabbyt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:56:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as a lot of other people here have mentioned, confidence is a big part of it, but it's much easier to be (or at least pretend to be) confident when you're relaxed!"
snowboarding,3d42pa,lpug21,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:09:27 2015 UTC,"Been there, man!  My major issue was toe-to-heel - I always was terrified of catching an edge and flipping backwards down the mountain!  I found that letting my front-foot lead my back foot by half a second in a turn really helped me realize that I could indeed steer down the mountain while still remaining quite stable!"
snowboarding,3d42pa,frenchbaguette,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"on steeper terrain really make sure your form is on point. Going heel to toe you're body should be shaped like a parenthesis ( so your hips are sticking out, not with your chest bent over your toes"
snowboarding,3d42pa,UUGE_ASSHOLE,5,Tue Jul 14 02:11:23 2015 UTC,at that level... just fucking do it. The only way youre going to get better is actual on snow riding time.
snowboarding,3d42pa,OhhGakGakGak,2,Mon Jul 13 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"For me, I think it was good to ride with a more experienced person, and get them to check your form, etc. That way you can revise and correct.  I just reckon when you're moving on to blues, or blacks (P.C.?) it's important that you're doing things properly so it's safe. Plus, your progression will be way faster.  But yeah, have fun!"
snowboarding,3d42pa,meeeow,2,Mon Jul 13 12:28:56 2015 UTC,"I'd just day be careful, most of the bad accidents I heard about (including mine) was exactly at this stage when you're comfortable enough to push yourself but not so comfortable you're nailing everything quite yet."
snowboarding,3d42pa,kleric42,2,Mon Jul 13 12:54:12 2015 UTC,"What goes to shit? I just started 2 seasons ago, and my biggest problem going from green to blue was just confidence and learning to look at my riding to figure out what was going wrong. Posture was my biggest thing, just having the right stance.   If you're nervous about speed (and that's what got me and still does), just shed speed often. Don't worry about what other riders are thinking about you, progress as you need to and build the confidence up.   Stay loose!"
snowboarding,3d42pa,djdavetrouble,2,Mon Jul 13 14:12:04 2015 UTC,"As the mountain gets steeper, many beginners have the tendency to lean back on their rear foot. Remember to keep your body perpendicular to the mountain!"
snowboarding,3d42pa,sigma220,2,Mon Jul 13 15:17:37 2015 UTC,Secondeded! On steeper terrain you gotta commit to putting more weight on ur leading foot when initiating turns. I'd even over exaggerate it as it can be difficult to get a sense of whether or not you have the weight distribution right.
snowboarding,3d42pa,langers84,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:32 2015 UTC,I think it is confidence that goes to shit. Happy as larry going toe to heel on a steeper run but heel to toe I shit myself a bit. Just need to build that confidence!!
snowboarding,3d42pa,okwaman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:47:46 2015 UTC,"For me, it was a confidence thing. Started slow and made wide turns that I could control my speed at a pace I was comfortable with. As someone else said, riding with someone at a more advanced level is a great way to push yourself too."
snowboarding,3d42pa,Wispwalk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:57:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest I found that it was an entirely mental transition (confidence to be more exact). If you have the fundamentals down, transitioning to blues and blacks is all about how comfortable you feel on your board. Nothing should really change about your form or technique (other than maybe bending your knees slightly more to absorb higher speed bumps and impacts)"
snowboarding,3d42pa,notmy2ndacct,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:10:50 2015 UTC,"What you're probably doing to mess up your form at higher speeds and cause you to catch an edge and fall is that you're turning by pushing out your back foot. This is a really, really un-stable way to turn, but it really easy to learn and not scary.  The proper way is to lean into your turns and almost jump from edge to edge, which gets more exaggerated the faster you go. This is hard to do when you're used to pushing out your back foot and a habit when you use that method is that you turn your chest downhill. You don't want that, you want your shoulder downhill.  The best way I've found to get rid of this is to start tapping your back hip with your back hand, and try to keep it over the tail of your board. In doing so you'll look and feel way more solid, and getting better will happen way quicker."

snowboarding,3d07rd,FuzzyCodgitator,2,Mon Jul 13 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"Typical sizing for board length should correlate (first) to rider weight, and (second) to boot size (wider for large feet). Rider height isn't a very useful factor.  If you've busted it up and want a new board, that's fine. Your original post just sounded like you thought it was a bad board, but didn't really know why."

snowboarding,3d07rd,FuzzyCodgitator,2,Tue Jul 14 05:30:54 2015 UTC,If I were fitting you for a park board I'd say consider something between a 151 & 154cm  a few suggestions... super soft : Lobster Park / Capita Horrorscope  medium soft: Arbor Westmark / Signal Troubadour  medium stiff: Rossignol Jibsaw / Slash Happy Place

snowboarding,3d07rd,FuzzyCodgitator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"Consider picking up a board size at the smaller end of your current weight spectrum, and then if you lose a few pounds it'll still be in the ""correct"" range. And if you don't lose a few pounds, it'll still be alright. Sizing isn't an exact science."

A couple of them were A-Basin sidecountry or Loveland Pass but most of them are hikes. I'm not going to get into specifics. If you have the initiative to hike/splitboard around here you're going to find terrain like that no matter where you go.

From what I've found, people don't necessarily GAF about the brand unless they are savvy. Depending on your area, the market will vary widely. I'm in the DC metro area and everyone buying boards it appears is a total newb and is just looking for a cheap(ish) deal and a cool graphic. Price it according to what's already on your local craigslist and hope for the best."
snowboarding,3crayk,cowtownboombox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:22:00 2015 UTC,"If you need the cash, Craigslist is your friend for sure. You could try to find a local swap but it's been my experience that most people there are just looking for something cheap to get little junior up on the hill. Never a bad idea to hold onto extra gear though, my first season was made possible in part by awesome friends who loaned me gear to use while I bought my own. Now I hold onto it in case my little brother or friends want to go."
snowboarding,3crayk,stg58,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"As others have said craigslist works well.  Just don't expect to get anywhere near what you paid for it new.  You should look at geartrader.com also, I've had success selling through that site."

snowboarding,3cqsf4,ma_k,3,Fri Jul 10 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"That may be a bit early for the snow to be decent - I've had bad luck going in January the last couple years, but then the Tahoe area snowpack has been at record lows in general recently. Squaw is awesome, but can be steep and you want good cover.  Given that, you might be best served by renting an SUV so you can go where the snow is. North Star, Alpine, Heavenly, or even Kirkwood are easily accessible, and you could look at that as snow insurance for a little extra cost. Some of them may share epic pass, but I can't recall which."
snowboarding,3cqsf4,sharks,4,Fri Jul 10 07:54:23 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  If you're going to book early, I would definitely get the SUV.    Exactly like /u/sharks said, it's a good hedge against snow conditions.  Kirkwood had a few days with mini-dumps that the other resorts didn't get.  Not enough to make a season out of but worth the drive in a bad season (it's a solid AM drive from North Lake Tahoe / Squaw area.)  Kirkwood is still the ""hidden"" gem (just less built-up...for now) of the area so it's worth getting a day in just to say you went if Squaw isn't holding your attention that week.   Staying up in North Lake area, Northstar can hold your attention for the day too, but will rarely have better snow than Squaw. They've been adding more and more park terrain, and that kept fairly well for the season.  It does have great steep tree-runs on the backside if you do get snow though.  Rarely tracked out because Northstar is more the ""family vacation"" mountain alternative to Squawllywood's scene. And the backside runs dump you to 1-2 very underutilized chairlifts, away from the frontside funnels.  Even on the worst of days, you can spin ~2K vertical laps for a workout on Burnout and have virtually 0 wait time for the lift.    These are not tips for something you'd really like on a vacation but since we've had some serious bad seasons I figured it's worth putting the advice for a worst-case-scenario day out there.  Every mountain can have a bad season, but the best way to mitigate that risk for the Tahoe area is definitely to have a car available."
snowboarding,3cqsf4,dolichoblond,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate to say it but I'm not sure I would risk booking too far in advance to the Table area or OP might be showing up to a bunch of rocks instead of snow. The drought as been brutal on that area. The weather there is so hit or miss."

snowboarding,3cqsf4,McGuinea,3,Sun Jul 12 03:10:26 2015 UTC,"Kirkwood, North Star and heavenly are all the same company you can get a Tahoe pass for like 380 and ride all those in a week. I worked at Kirkwood one year and it became my favorite mountain. Never got crowded, endless fun in the trees/bowls. Heavenly is huge, and North Star is packed with terrain parks. South lake is a fun town to stay in, a lot of partying cheap food and taxis/ buses."
snowboarding,3cqsf4,cramburry,2,Fri Jul 10 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"Beware the Heavenly Cat Tracks.  You can burn up a whole day migrating from NV to CA and back looking for a good section, all the while getting cut off and forced to stop on a track by bus tour groups of bad skiers & boarders.  Some great places to play when you do get through it all though.  But much easier to recommend steering to Kirkwood instead of gambling.  (jealous you got to work there)"
snowboarding,3cqsf4,dolichoblond,2,Fri Jul 10 18:23:25 2015 UTC,"If you just needed a ride to Alpine Meadows they have a shuttle.  If you are looking for liquor and all that on the cheap it is a bit of a drive.  The resort has bars and stores.  The best place to buy tickets is at a university or in advance online (Liftopia ideally, but also Squaw's site).  I'm not sure if they still do this, but if you are military it is free Sundays.  The closer to season the more expensive it will get (conditions permitting).  As far as lodging goes I usually make a day trip out of it.  It is a fantastic mountain with lots of runs.  Weekdays are best for crowds.  Do the full mountain runs first thing in the morning as they will get crowded and covered in moguls later in the afternoon.  I recommend riding in the ""Siberia"" section once things get crowded unless you do park.  It's a pretty awesome place to ride and has something for every skill level / discipline."
snowboarding,3cqsf4,EmpireofWin,2,Fri Jul 10 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"If you can, book February or March for a better chance at having decent snow coverage. We hardly got any snow here in January, but had a few mini dumps in Feb/March. April wasn't bad either, given the drought conditions. Hopefully this El Nino sticks around and dumps snow all winter.   Staying in on-mountain lodging is fun. Tahoe City is a fun little town that's pretty close to Squaw and Alpine, easy drive. Booking a vehicle with AWD or 4WD would be best. If you rent a 2WD car, make sure to have snow chains, just in case. Cal Trans will set up checkpoints on certain highways during storms.   It's a super fun resort, I could ride the Siberia area all day and not get bored. They're actually putting up a new lift in that section now, and tore down the old one."
snowboarding,3cqsf4,McGuinea,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:16:53 2015 UTC,I would avoid booking a trip to Tahoe in January as there is a high chance there won't be a deep enough base to really enjoy the terrain Squaw has. The past 3 seasons Tahoe had exceptionally warm and/or dry Januarys. I would suggest looking more towards late February.
snowboarding,3cqsf4,ShitIForgotMyPants,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"As everyone has said, snowpack has been bad in January the last few years, but hopefully it will be different with a big early season El Niño pattern. Could be a huge nov and dec. if you want to stay near squaw, look for a place in Olympic valley. If you get a car (taxi is about $60-100 each way from Reno), you can stay in Truckee and drive 20 min each day. Truckee is a real cool place and prob cheaper. Also, you'd be about half way in between squaw and boreal if you want to do some park night riding after a day at squaw (boreal is open until 9pm everyday and has an awesome park). Squaw is a great place midweek, and then go to alpine on the weekends when the Bay Area crowds roll in.   PS: good/cheap breakfast burritos at Safeway in Truckee for a quick delish breakfast.   Let me know if you have any other questions"

Source: I put about 50 days on the Super Lashed this year and didn't wreck my bindings.  Also, regarding your other Q about sizing link...  I've owned 3 pair of 32 boots: twice the TM2 and now the Super Lashed.  The older boots (like, 2005ish) had a cramped toe box and probably needed a half-size up, but since then they've been true to me. I have worn a size 11 street shoe since probably 1995, and the size 11 boots from 32 always fit great. I wouldn't (personally) size up, nor down."

snowboarding,3co7vo,Quadly,7,Thu Jul 9 13:06:41 2015 UTC,I went to their adult summer camp. It was the best time of my life snowboard all day and then get hammered with pro snowboarders that were there all night
snowboarding,3co7vo,dwhite5278,3,Thu Jul 9 15:34:26 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty cool. They have a couple jumps into the foam pit and just a couple boxes and rails. It is primarily a skate park other than that. The trampolines are a lot of fun too though, and last time I was there they had a mini board to strap on while you were on the trampolines. If you do go, make sure you wear long pants. Rug burn on that fake snow they use hurts."
snowboarding,3co7vo,Magnugget,3,Thu Jul 9 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"Do you remember how much it cost and how long you got to mess around? There's no real pricing on the website, beyond saying an ""Intro session"" is $49."
snowboarding,3co7vo,Magnugget,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:37:18 2015 UTC,No sorry this was a few years ago and I wasn't the one who payed. I do remember we were there for a while though. I wasn't feeling the jump and just hit the boxes and nobody ever told me time was up. I'm not sure if there's a time limit on the jumps or not.

snowboarding,3co7vo,RubMyColon,3,Thu Jul 9 23:11:43 2015 UTC,"I went there a couple years ago with my university's ski club. Since I was with a large group, we got discounted rates on what I believe was the intro session you mentioned below but I don't remember exactly how much I paid. I thought it was pretty sweet.  We did some stuff on the trampolines for a little while which was super fun and then they taught us how to maneuver on their ""snow"", which is this rough carpet type material (wear long pants/sleeves if you go). They have a small hill with a couple rails that's not too steep that you practice on to get used to their surface, and then if you're feeling it, you walk up some stairs to a taller, steeper hill where you drop in and jump into a foam pit. Once you're in the foam pit there's some guy controlling a crane basically that you grab onto to lift you out.  From what I remember, after everyone drops in once, if you even want to, then you have the rest of the time (2 hours total I want to say?) to do whatever you want. I'm pretty sure you have to take the intro class your first time there, but after that you can pay and go do whatever you want. They gave us more discount cards for that and I know some of my friends went back but I didn't want to spend more money on it.  I would definitely recommend going at least once though, especially if you've never done anything like that before. Personally, being from the Midwest, it was the first and only time I've been able to snowboard indoors, so it was a cool and unique experience."

There is a greater than 90% chance that El Niño will continue through Northern Hemisphere fall 2015, and around an 85% chance it will last through the 2015-16 winter.*   Last year:   No El Nino at this time. SST anomalies did not persist. The % chance was 65% of El Nino through December/January.

snowboarding,3ckhrr,philop,2,Wed Jul 8 16:51:17 2015 UTC,Are you a Canadian citizen or already have a work permit? Ull have to sort that out and there are costs associated with it.  -you won't need a car. There is public transit that seems to work out well from what I've heard -I'd focus your efforts on housing and worry about the job later as hospitality will hire closer to when things get busy. Ideally ud want to get there in September to secure housing as I've heard it gets verrryyy difficult in October onwards. From what I've heard it doesn't even sound easy in september. I don't have any experience securing housing out of country but craigalist or kijiji is whered I'd look first. Wouldn't be surprised if there is a whistler Facebook group for housing.
snowboarding,3ckhrr,sigma220,2,Wed Jul 8 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"When I did my first season I underestimated the costs. Landning a job took more than a month, which meant I needed money to live for two months plus two months of rent obviously. On top of that, most places will need a month deposit as well. Add that up and plus the season pass and equipment and travel expenses - that should be an estimate of cost.   It's expansive to do a season!"
snowboarding,3ckhrr,pansars,2,Wed Jul 8 17:26:26 2015 UTC,Hey man. I lived in Whistler for a few years. Passes are a lot. But if you can get a job with the mountain they'll give you one. Research when their job fair is. I think it's October. Go to that because the mountain doesn't hire much after that. You can possibly get staff housing too. Which isn't free but is cheaper.  Renting usually requires 1/2 month rent as damage deposit. So if rent is 500 you'll have to cough up 750 on the first day. You don't need a car in Whistler as long as you don't move to Emerald.
snowboarding,3ckhrr,jsbell_69,2,Wed Jul 8 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"housing doesn't seem too hard to come by   Good luck dude. Finding housing in any B.C. skitown is hard, unless you come early in the shoulder season before everyone else does. If you're an Aussie, there's always the option if renting out a closet, or a crawl space to sleep in.   As for money? Bring at least double of what you think you'll need. BC is expensive. Money goes fast."
snowboarding,3ckhrr,Roloboto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in whistler now & you are so very, very wrong about housing...  Come as early as possible and budget twice as much as you think you need. Whistler is incredibly expensive and last year people were paying $600/m for a couch.  Join whistler housing for locals on Facebook and go back to November to see how fucked up it is.  If you come soon, try get into Glacier Staff Housing. Hospitality background will help, try get some fine dining experience before you come (or embellish lol) because that's where the real money is here & fine dining doesn't open til 11am at most places (powder days are usually tracked out by then anyway).  Feel free to ask any more questions if you'd like."
snowboarding,3ckhrr,Sharksarescary,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:41:52 2015 UTC,"Lived in Whistler 3 years. Do it, unquestionably the greatest place on earth (coming from a decently travelled Brit). You don't need a car, public transport is excellent. Get there in October and sort out accommodation before the rush. Decent accommodation is far tougher to come by then work, especially since you have some experience in hospitality.  Try and group up with some folk when you arrive and then house hunt together. Renting a whole place as a group typically gets something far nicer than some of the big shared houses specifically rented to people doing seasons. Only problem with arriving in Oct is that you likely won't start working till Nov (even if you line up a job earlier) since October is shoulder season and business is very slow. This means ideally you need a couple of months rent with you when arriving. The season pass is your next biggest cost, as mentioned above, a job with the mountain will get you one of these for free so do check out when the WB hiring fairs are and line up a spot in advance if you can. Do bear in mind though that if you work for the mountain, by definition you will mainly be working when the mountain is open. This can be a pretty serious downer if you are there mainly for the riding. Bussing tables while everyone else is shredding can be tough on the soul! Depends on your priorities I guess. Like I said, just do it. I only left because I couldn't get another visa!"

snowboarding,3ckhrr,iViacho,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"If you're 100% keen on Whistler, go to Whistler. Try to get a corp job with staff housing to start with. If you're not 100% keen on Whistler, there are tons of other amazing resorts around Canada that you'll thoroughly enjoy.  Rent in non staff housing starts at about $700 a month for a single bedroom and can be off the hill (bus ride) Rent in staff housing is shared and is more like 400-500 a month.  Finding a job is hard at Whistler. Like yourself and the rest of the people in this thread and looking to go to Canada, this is the first choice. Hospitality is a great area to get into but unless you are a female, you'll likely be a dish bitch or cook or bus boy.   Now if you're Australian, like most Whistler employees (lol) check out this thread here: https://www.boardworld.com.au/forums/viewthread/18391  It has a lot of things to help you with the Visa, SIN, Phone, Car and Everything else you need to do / bring to Canada."

snowboarding,3ckhrr,STUPID_REDDIT_INJOKE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:29:47 2015 UTC,"I've just got home 2months ago from last season!   You don't need a car, can basically walk everywhere, or get a bus pass for around $60 a month I think. Housing is around $600 a month, that's looking at the more cheaper places, you can get to around $450-500, but expect to share the house with 10-20 other people. Getting a job is easy, I recommend working as a lifty to be honest, four 10 hour days a week. So three days off of full riding, plus you can ride during your lunch breaks at work, plus a free season pass, and discounts at a few stores, up to 50% off.  but you'll be working for $10.25 an hour. If you want this, I'd say look into applying before you come here, because it's one of the more popular jobs. You would also get staff housing, ( I reccomend Glacier if you want to meet lots of people and go out drinking lots)   Money, you can live off what you earn over there, I spend about 7k of my savings over there, But I had to buy a lot of gear, plus I went on a mini holiday to Whitehorse. But I would still say, save as much as you can, 3-4k should be plenty though.   But if you just rock up to Whistler, you'll be able to get a job within a few days easy, there's always places looking.   I'll be there this season too! Working again as a lifty, can't snowboard til February though because I tore my ACL. Whistler is an amazing place, the snow was shit last season, but I still had a ton of fun up there on the mountain.   Anymore questions feel free to ask :)"

But I can't remember what dates the mountain actually opened, think it was like mid November. So if you get to Whistler earlier your going to have a better chance at a job working for the mountain. Being on the maintenance team is also a really good job! If you have any skills in Mechanics/engineering or working with tools you could have a decent chance at getting it, the pay is better and you still only work 4 days a week, and all the maintenance workers are chill."

snowboarding,3cjg22,barrist,2,Wed Jul 8 11:32:07 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I am looking for advice or suggestions on a new board for my wife. This would be her second one.   We both just started boarding a few years ago. Would probably guess we're generally intermediate at this stage. The board that she started off with (K2 Bright Lite) is actually probably a bit too short for her so she's looking for something a bit more stable at higher speeds, and with magnetraction as we deal with alot of the icy stuff here in the east. She's 5'5"", 130lbs. This was still within the range of the 142 size of that particular K2 for some reason (most other brands she would have been on a ~148), but I think as she's progressing she would benefit from a larger one.   With magnetraction being a factor, it kind of narrows down our choices to one of the Mervyn brands or Rossi basically. My question has to do mostly with the shape:   what kind of shape should she look at who doesn't want to do any park? i.e. for GNU, would she look for a C2 BTX? Note: Her K2 was an all-terrain baseline shape (flat in the middle with rockers near the tip/tail), so i assume there will be a period of adjustment   Thanks in advance!"
snowboarding,3cjg22,Lpbo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:31:05 2015 UTC,"For the shape, it depends how she likes to ride? Sounds to me like traditional camber would fit well for riding hard, especially in icy conditions. If you're planning to do pow regularly a hybrid camber would be more useful and adapted to everything."
snowboarding,3cjg22,danger-pony,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"C2 or C3 would be great. But it might be too advanced depending on how she rides.   If she is just looking to play around and links her turns without carving, she will be really happy on the Gnu B-Nice. Its a great all around board for any level. You can also look into any of the Roxy boards. Most boards in their line up are similar and have just slightly better material and a slightly different shape depending on the board.  Let me know if you have any more questions."

snowboarding,3choc0,aghalide,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:44:24 2015 UTC,100% at least try them on in store. I'm a 12 and I tried 7 different boots on last year. All felt completely different. Left the store with a pair I never expected to buy and love them. You could always try them on and then find a better deal online.

snowboarding,3cey06,Draithian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:32:09 2015 UTC,"Hey guys. Before last year I had gone snowboarding a total of twice in my life; this past winter, however, I was away for my first year of college in New England and had a chance to go out and snowboard a lot more. I had a double season pass to Mt. Snow and Stratton, and even bought a really cheap used 2011 Rossi Sultan (whose top laminate is now unfortunately cracked all over after a bad fall). I really enjoyed getting more into it this last season however, and really want to spend at least as much if not more time boarding this coming winter. I just bought a 2015 Rossi Taipan Amptek (was super on sale and seemed like a pretty well-rounded board) and am hoping to progress a lot more this winter. My question is this:  As a now 19-year-old who is just beginning to progress into ""intermediate"" riding, is there time left for me to learn how to ride at an advanced level, and if so, what are some tips on how to progress my riding, ESPECIALLY my ability to throw tricks (which right now is essentially non-existent). Apologies for the long post, and thanks for the advice."
snowboarding,3cey06,redtwister,5,Tue Jul 7 15:00:11 2015 UTC,"I started the same age (at mount snow too) I've had a solid year and a half and I think it doesn't really matter as much how good you get so much as you enjoy the sport. When im on the mountain i just feel at peace. Its all progression, I'm going to start venturing to carinthia this year to start learning tricks, let me know if you need another beginning trick buddy."
snowboarding,3cey06,El_Zalo,3,Tue Jul 7 15:48:14 2015 UTC,I just bought a 2015 Rossi Taipan Amptek (was super on sale and seemed like a pretty well-rounded board)    Best board for the money I've ever had. I got one for $140 a few years ago and I loved everything about it.   what are some tips on how to progress my riding   Ride more. Practice what you want to get good at. You can also get the Snowboard Addiction videos. They're very good and cheaper than a lesson.
snowboarding,3cey06,QAZZY10,0,Tue Jul 7 21:40:14 2015 UTC,A lesson will get you a lot more than those videos
snowboarding,3cey06,El_Zalo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"A lesson will get you a lot more than those videos   A ""how to ride a snowboard"" lesson for a beginner? Certainly. In fact, my standard recommendation for people who want to learn how to ride is to forget about online videos or tips and to just get a lesson. But he specifically asked about getting better at tricks, which implies that he already knows how to ride at least at an intermediate level.   I've taken freestyle lessons and they were helpful, but not much. There's only so much you can learn in a single 2-3 hour session, even if it's one on one (which by itself costs more than the entire series of SA videos). But you can watch the videos and practice what you see on your own time as much as needed. Unlike most bullshit internet tutorials for tricks, the SA videos do a decent job at breaking down the parts of a trick and giving you actionable advice on how to progress towards landing the trick on snow."

snowboarding,3ccc76,da_chubsta,2,Tue Jul 7 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"Moved the TL;DR details down here  I just finished a dream project and built my own snowboard.  It's pretty exciting!  That said, it's far from perfect, I completed a ton of research, and made lots of notes, plans, and sketches before I finally got down to business.  Here's a rundown of what I did both for my own reference and to help (or even inspire) any other shredders looking to get creative and not sure where to start.  There wasn't much out there when I was starting this project and I almost didn't go through with it because it seemed daunting (it isn't though!)  I'll detail my method and mention alternatives to what I did and how my method will change for the next board.  This is not a step by step guaranteed way to build a snowboard.  This is what I did.  If you decide to build one I encourage you to look all over and see what other tried and true methods are out there; my board might delaminate (fall apart) after the first turn!  It's exciting not knowing but at the same time, be wary of what you read here (and everywhere).  There are a few proven and more work intensive ways of building boards/skiis.  This isn't really that lol.  With that disclaimer done, here's what I did!  Step 1: Inspiration  So you want to build a snowboard.  Awesome!  What do you want it to do?  Where do you ride?  What is your dream day?  I'm on the East Coast, I like powder (when we get it), I like ""surfing the snow"", the trees are a bit tight in VT for my 160, I'm good at woodworking and building things, board building has always seemed awesome.  Get your own answers for those questions and start looking at what's out there.  Get a feel for what's been made/what's being made and use it as a starting point, even copy some dimensions for your first board.  There's more to snowboards than Burton Customs!  Even if you don't build your own, here's some awesome board builders that inspired me that everyone should check out (and support!) as well as some big name brands making cool boards:  PowderJet: VT based maker of vertically laminated boards handmade in his shop out of maple and poplar.  Pretty much exactly what I had in mind, but already out there.  Since I've built my board they started offering build your own classes and will build your design.  Nice way to get creative if you don't have the time/money/space/energy to build it all yourself.  Check em out!  Snoplanks: Oregon based company making boards in a similar process to PowderJet.  Cool simple designs and a rad company making affordable low volume boards.  Old school boards like the original Winterstick and Burton Performer.  Always wanted to ride a Performer but they cost so much money.  They don't belong in a museum or over your fancy mountain town bar!  They deserve to be ridden!  (and cared for haha).  Short boards by big companies like the YES 420 and Burton Fishcuit; these cut 10+cm from your normal stance without sacrificing ride.  Very important to my design.  (YES makes The Clark for you to cut your own shape out of a blank; I think LibTech offers similar)  The Japanese were a heavy influence specifically Moss SnowStick and Gentemstick from Taro Tamai (he worked at Moss in the 70s; really really awesome dude, read up on him!).  ""Snowsurfing"" is huge over there and starting to make waves (hah!) here in the states with demo days and events.  It is also the exact style of riding I love.  Huge influence.  Ettore Barabino: an Italian making wacky and awesome designs and not giving a fuck about overcomplicating the build process.  Get out there and rip it!  Springbreak:  Making crazy art with boards and tearing it up!  It's fun just watching guys ride some of the wild shapes they put out.  333Skis:  Skiis built out of a van!  I could go on and on like this for hours, there are so many awesome boards being made by awesome dudes that will get your imaginations running wild.  Get inspired and get shredding!  Step 2: Plan the Build  Your standard board is horizontally laminated.  Yes there's good reasons for this.  It's a pain in the ass if your just throwing together in your basement.  Your first board will not be factory good; you probably will never make one that good.  So don't over think this.  Have fun and get building!  I went with a vertical lamination, basically like a skateboard or longboard.  It's what a few of the builders above do.  I also wanted Ptex and metal edges.  It's simple.  For pow both aren't necessary but I wanted the ability to traverse resort runs to get to trees.    Metal edges are a pain in the ass and my next few boards will NOT have them.  Yes they make wax for wood bases and there's ways to finish the base to help that.  Idk how to yet but the info is out there.  My advice: skip the edges for your first few, especially if it's pow, but Ptex is fine.  It's cheap and easy to work with.  For the build look at how others build.  Watch these videos for good visual on vacuum press and lots of details.  Check out skibuilders.com for another good how to and lots of forum info.  Look into how skateboards go together.  Synthesize what you see and figure out something that works for you.  There are some intense presses out there.  Compress air into a firehouse is most expensive and difficult to setup; not good if you're making your first board and not sure how far you're going to take this project.  Vacuum press is cheaper and widely used.  You could also just use a bottle jack with a few tons of force or lay boards over the top and bottom and clamp hard throughout (this is how people build longboards)  I went with a vacuum press first build.  Consistent pressure can be difficult and it isn't very high pressure.  My vacuum bag had issues being sealed and I ended up clamping and putting heavy weights on the board during the vacuum process.  For the rest of the summer I'm going to use clamps while I design a press with a bottle jack.  Don't forget about your rocker or camber.  You need the base of your press to give the board shape.  You can build this a few ways.  I made a master profile shape, then cut a bunch of  ""ribs"" off of it.  Mounted everything to a sturdy flat base.  Pressed down onto it.  Step 3: Materials  These guys have everything you need and ship super quick.  If you need to add to your order before it's shipped they are super accommodating.  What I purchased:  Ptex base Binding inserts 19oz triaxial fiberglass Metal edges Vibration material Baltic Birch Veneer Stain Polyurethane Superglue Epoxy (used West System 105A and 206A.  These cups are a god send for mixing)  The wood that makes up your core is hard to get.  For horizontal lamination you have a lot of steps.  Poplar, maple, baltic birch are all common.   For vertical find thin wood veneers (1/16"") and make a layer cake out of them.  Most veneers are sold in 1/4"" sandwich of 3 sheets already bonded together.  The top and bottom layers (the ones that show) are always of the wood you want, the middle is sometimes crap filler. MAKE SURE YOUR VENEER SHEET IS PURE.  I went with baltic birch because it is strong and fairly light and was the only pure veneer sheeting available.  Veneers can take sometime to hunt down as Home Depot and most lumber yards won't have what your looking for.  Hunt around for specialty wood suppliers or plywood specialists, those will be your best bet."
snowboarding,3ccc76,numbersaresexy,2,Mon Jul 6 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"Step 4: The Build  Now that you have all your materials you can start building!  First things first, build that base to give your board it's profile.  I made the ribs, set them straight, glued them, then nail gunned them from the bottom to keep them in place.  Print out your design or get it CNC'd if you really want.  I designed in SolidWorks and sent it to a CNC guy.  He also made my master ribs.  This isn't totally necessary and adds cost.  I'd recommend printing out your design (form any free online CAD software) and cutting based on that.  Use a jigsaw to cut.  You can use a router with a template bit but those bits are shit (it destroyed my template).  Just jigsaw it.  Take your time, be safe, and use a sander to clean up the cuts and make your sides perfect.  Cut holes for your inserts so you can attach bindings.  Use a pipe bender to bend your metal edges to shape.  This is a pain in the ass as they are hardened steel and not meant for pipe benders.  You can make your own dedicated edge shaper if you'd like.  I'd recommend skipping edges all together.  If you're stupid like me and think that your first board NEEDS edges you will super glue them to the Ptex.  Clamp the edges to the Ptex with a thousand clamps.  Good clamps.  Don't skimp like I did or else you'll over do it on the superglue.  Place a small drop of superglue every 3-5 teeth.  The superglue is not there for structural hold, that's what the epoxy is for during the layup.  It's just there to keep those rascally edges in place during layup.  I used too much superglue and am afraid not enough epoxy took hold and am expecting my edges to rip off after a few runs (if that long).  That's part of the learning process fun!  Get ready to layup.  Take extra time to plan.  Watch this video to see how meticulous you should be.  Good preparation will allow for a quick and stress free layup.  You need to be quick for the epoxy (but not too quick, don't worry).  This is how you align your core with your base.  It is very important.  Do this..  Place the rest of your inserts into the wood core.  Find a clear area with good air circulation to layup.  USE PROPER PROTECTION WHEN WORKING WITH EPOXY.  Mix your epoxy following the instructions.  Lay the Ptex on your base.  Now you're ready to start making your snowboard sandwich!   Evenly distribute epoxy on Ptex making sure to work it into the edges Line edges with vibration material.  Work into epoxy Lay fiberglass over Ptex.  Cut fiberglass where Ptex glued insert is.  Work epoxy into fiberglass.  Apply more epoxy and work it into fiberglass until saturated.  Get some fiberglass epoxied outside of the edges, this will make it easier to remove when you're done. Place first veneer ontop using inserts as guide.  Press firmly, you do not want any air bubbles.  Apply more epoxy. Place further veneers the same way.  The more veneers you use the stiffer and heavier the board will be.  I used 6 veneers plus 19oz fiberglass.  It is pretty stiff but has some flex.  I am happy with it. Now cover with the top of your vacuum bag or your pressing/clamping system. Leave until epoxy sets.  Varies on temperature and epoxy.  12 hours or so. Dream of shredding your hand made board.   Step 5: Finishing  You're almost there (with the board and this TL DIY)!  Congrats!  Remove your sweet shredstick and admire it.  Mmmmm she's pretty.  Use a jigsaw to cut the excess fiberglass away.  Good thing it hardened with epoxy and was easy to remove huh?  Sand the hell out of the top (80 grit, 100, 120, 150, 220).  I oversanded the nose through the first layer of veneer.  Apply stain for a few minutes (seriously, like 1 or 2 for dark like mine; you can always add more).  Wipe off with a rag and let dry.  I applied 3 coats of polyurethane to the top for water protection.  Let dry  And that's it, she's done!  And more photogenic than she has any right to be.  It wasn't the easiest thing, but it's seriously not that hard!  Do it!  Build a snowboard!  Go wild!  Go crazy!  Go shred the gnar!!!!  You'll appreciate all the little problems with it and find many ways to improve your next board (because you WILL want to do it again and try out new shapes, materials, methods, etc, etc).  If you want to ask specific shape questions please do!  I filled a notebook with research and designs, and looked hard into how surfboards are shaped, specifically their tail designs, and can't wait to see if the way design shapes for water translate to snow.  And this shit is fun to talk about haha.  TL;DR  I made a snowboard.  It isn't perfect but it is mine.  I couldn't find a great DIY for it so here's mine.  Ask any and all questions, feel free to PM!  Thanks for reading!  (adding pics now pics added)"

snowboarding,3c9he6,Hair_Farmer,3,Tue Jul 7 14:42:35 2015 UTC,I've been riding strictly Bataleons for the last 4-5 years and I don't think I'll switch.   Global Warmer is the best park board I've ever rode in my life. Disaster is the best jib board to ride at Bear in the world. The TBT tech is great. Epic in the park and also very floaty in powder. I cannot stress enough how much I endorse Bataleon.   Solid company with a great warranty program. Yeah for it!

The only issue is wind. A lot of the new snow is blown off, so you have to hunt for pow stashes. The groomers are great though and the park at The Remarks is sick. They've built small and medium lines and are starting on the large line right now. You're going to have an awesome trip."

We can afford to spend a bit for an abnormal holiday (since you can really only shred 2-3 months a year) Supply and Demand. In Australia we have 5 MAJOR ski fields.

I also have a 161.5 gnu riders choice that is solid in the park. If you want to spin really fast, these boards wouldn't be great. But if you want to stomp big hits (Park or elsewhere) a longer board can be the way to go. I don't think board length makes a huge amount of difference, you'll learn to ride what you end up deciding on."

I would say if your just going to ride park with it stay on the shorter side 152-155. If it's going to be your only setup and you ever venture out of the park  go 155-158.

snowboarding,3bv1tk,mierikswortel70s,2,Thu Jul 2 11:32:07 2015 UTC,This summer I bought myself a summer holiday pass for Snowworld in the Netherlands (two indoor slopes) and am planning to go there pretty often. After two times in the snow it looks to me my snowboard's base is kind of dirty and full of scratches in the wax: http://imgur.com/diY3avO  Does it look like I should wax it? (I am still somewhat of a beginner so I don't really know how it feels if there is not enough wax on my board). And is it usual for a wax job to wear out quickly in synthetic snow?
snowboarding,3bv1tk,Too_Tall_Dont_Ball,3,Thu Jul 2 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"You should have waxed long ago. See the white streaks along the edge? That's an indicator that the base is extremely dry. You should wax before these streaks appear. A dry base is an unhappy base.

If you're getting a proper hot wax, it obviously depends on riding conditions but rule of thumb you should get about twenty days of riding out of it.  There's other stuff that goes into it, like sintered vs. extruded base, but that might be more information than you're looking for."

snowboarding,3bnuby,Travkin2,5,Tue Jun 30 23:53:08 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge it hasn't been there for several seasons. TWSnowboarding  wrote an article about it in '93 or so.  Basically theres a canyon way up Angeles Crest (Somewhere between Waterman and Mt. High) that used to get filled in with snow during winter. The snow on the surrounding cliff faces would avalanche into the canyon and the result would be a 100 foot deep pile of snow on a pretty steep pitch. It would take well into July to melt away.  A bunch of locals would go up there after the regular season and build some park jumps and rails. Small by todays standards, but it was a lot of fun back then. I remember seeing Bryan Iguchi, Steve Ruff and Dave Downing up there one day just ruling it. I learned BS 540s there, as well as some various FS 360 grabs. We'd bring lunch and a bag of salt and just session the two or three jumps all day. Such good memories of that place.  I'm not familiar with why it was called the Forbidden Glacier, but it's the name we used for it and the name that was in the magazine. I know some people fell through the snow into the caves below and had to be helicoptered out. Then at some point they stopped opening the highway during summer, so we coudn't get to it.  I'm thinking the last time it even snowed enough up there was probably the 94/95 season, so if you're under 30 thats why you never heard of it.  If I can find the magazine in my archives, I'll scan and post it.  edit: cant speel edit2: added the TWSnowboarding cover"

snowboarding,3bk6tu,cloudsofgrey,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:39:58 2015 UTC,how long does the snow stick around? when do you think it will be un rideable?
snowboarding,3bk6tu,Kjarahz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:44:39 2015 UTC,Well there won't be much longer. For another week or 2 I'd say it's worth getting after. The thing about patch skiing is you're usually doing a lot of hiking for a little bit of riding. If you want to get out there and hike anyway then you won't be upset when you only get 500 feet of vertical.

snowboarding,3bk6tu,donthemonk,3,Tue Jun 30 02:23:30 2015 UTC,North Carolina has a great winter this year. Had some awesome days at Beech and Sugar.
snowboarding,3bk6tu,Kjarahz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"That new slope was pretty fun at Sugar, I call bullshit on blue/black though. That second drop was something, was a good time there at Sugar though, I have to agree. It's just hit or miss especially since I have to plan awhile in advance and drive almost 5 hours there.  Is Beech worth a visit, I've been to Sugar a handful of times."
snowboarding,3bk6tu,lacrosse4hirer,2,Tue Jun 30 15:38:48 2015 UTC,Beech is definitely worth a visit and has some good runs. Highest ski resort on the east coast. Bubch of good slopes. I caught it a day this winter when there were 10 inches of fresh snow and had a blast. It's only a two hour drive for me. Snowshoe in WV is great but its definitely a farther drive. Slopes are  little steeper and more variety of runs.  Plus a cool bar right at the top of the lift

snowboarding,3bmd54,JermIsMyHomeboy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:31:59 2015 UTC,"Delayed response, but I'd avoid the Goliath. TBT sounds like a ton of fun on soft snow, but I wouldn't want to count on it in East Coast conditions. And for what it's worth both the Mod and Team are a fairly park-minded boards. Not that you can't ride them anywhere, but it may not be exactly what you're looking for.  As for boots, there is no substitute to trying them for yourself. Go to a good board shop, listen to what the bootfitter is telling you, and buy from them if you can because if you don't support your local shop they won't be there when you need to buy your next pair."
snowboarding,3bmd54,chirv,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:37 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was worried about regarding TBT. Why do you say that the mod is a park board? I've read lots of reviews and think I'll end up with that. I know it's a true twin but it's actually super stiff.  As for boots I found a really good deal on Salomon Dialogues brand new for $125 so I ordered them. I totally would buy from a local shop but as a 15 year old with no licence or car there are literally no shops I could call local. The one that was went out of business last year :(

snowboarding,3bhnwe,ksprzk,2,Tue Jun 30 02:01:00 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I don't think many riders realize how expensive it is to keep a mountain open when there's little natural snowfall. Making snow is incredibly expensive.

snowboarding,3bjiny,Ctrl-Break,3,Mon Jun 29 19:06:17 2015 UTC,"You should definitely go to Avoriaz in France. It's perhaps my favourite resort in Europe, considered to be one of the best snowboarding resorts in the world! It offers a big boarding area as your pass covers the whole Portes Du Solei with over 200 lifts. Portes Du Solei also opens up the possibility of skiing into the Swiss alps as well.   What makes Avoriaz a bit unique (together with Val Thorens, also to be considered!) is that it's located up in the mountain. There are no regular roads in the village which makes it car free. Instead you use the only taxi service which is horse sleigh. Perfect for a honeymoon as it's quite romantic in the sunset to squeeze up together to keep warm :-)   It makes for an absolutely amazing scenery living up in the mountains like that. Google some images and you'll understand!  The easiest way of getting there is flying to Geneve and having a car transfer from there directly to the village, which takes about 3-4 hours. Not to expensive either.   Though, it's perhaps not the biggest apres ski party place in the alps. If that's what you're looking for, you should definitely look up St Anton am Arlberg in Austria. (Party capital of the skiing resorts in the alps) I spent a whole season there so if you have any questions just holla at me"

There are even rooms and couches on Airbnb at Breck and Keystone for less than $75/night. There's a bus from downtown Denver to Frisco for $12 each way.  BTW Summit County has Keystone, Copper, Breckenridge, and Arapahoe Basin... not to mention tons of backcountry. Vail is only 25 minutes away.  On another note, I had no problem finding people to go on ski trips when I arrived at college."

snowboarding,3bjt96,snowboardermag,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:35:21 2015 UTC,"Airbnb is great advice. Mammoth is a good option, as far as locations go as well, with easy access to a shuttle system, just stay as close to the Village as possible. As aghalide says, Summit County's transit system is really awesome and so many resorts within close proximity of one another. Also check out whether your school has a snowboard club--often they organize trips you can jump on or just meet some people to travel with. If they don't have one, start your own! Totally worth it for meeting like-minded people, as well as finding a crew to share trips to the mountains locally."

snowboarding,3bbzix,Mrsleepyhamster,2,Sat Jun 27 21:37:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, they did cancel a few sessions. Luckily i went earlier. They have a big park, ranging from small features to big features. One part is progression with rails and small jumps. Other part is bigger rails and 50-60 foot jumps. If you go they will rank you by skill for your learning part of the day. After you can go anywhere. They also have a full and mini pipe."
snowboarding,3bbzix,wolfbrother22,2,Sun Jun 28 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"Just got back from there on the 24th.  There is about 80% less snow than there was last year.  You could ride all the way down to the parking lot last year this year you have to download.  Windell's and High Cascade are sharing a lap park and superpipe. Each camp has its own private park. I only rode the high cascade park. It was okay. The only problem is the park is very short.  You can opt to hit a jump, or two rails then a quarter pipe at the end. Then your back in line for the tow rope. Windell's park looked a little better, but I didn't get an opportunity to ride there.  It was pretty hot and the snow was melting fast. I have no idea how they are going to keep it up all summer. Camp of Champions is the program that has cancelled sessions. To my knowledge neither high cascade nor windells has cancelled anything.  Even with less than ideal park and snow conditions you will have a lot of fun and learn a ton."

snowboarding,3bao5q,Veadro,3,Sat Jun 27 13:31:34 2015 UTC,In wake boarding your edge for control is mostly on the back. In snowboarding it's the sides. The back does nothing and the front will not magically dip into the snow and cause cartwheels like a Wake board. You need even pressure on each foot to maintain solid control. It took me a while to link turns because once I was off edge I would instinctively lean back. This caused my front end to slip and id have a 50% chance of catching the wrong edge.

snowboarding,3b2uas,hackadome,25,Thu Jun 25 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"Skiing is cool again, plain and simple. With wider skis, and twin tip designs being commonplace - it now shares some aspects of the counter culture that defined snowboarding for so many years.  You add poles - easy movement around the mountain, and no bending over to ratchet or clamp a binding, and the fact that the human body is designed to go forwards and backwards and not sideways - it's pretty easy to understand why people are leaving - or not even taking up snowboarding in the first place.  Plus - with so much sidecountry and backcountry interest not everyone wants to use a split board - so touring is also taking some market share."
snowboarding,3b2uas,towrope,7,Thu Jun 25 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this, I've been considering getting back on skis for a few seasons now. I love snowboarding, I've been doing it for 15 years now, but I want to give skiing another shot.   I do not however want to deal with the learning curve of getting back on skis. I'm a pretty good rider, especially freeriding in trees and all that, nothing phases me anymore. I don't want to have to learn how to ski.   As others have said, there's no real push for just enjoying snowboarding. The movies now, aside from JJ (big mountain) are all big handrails and 80 foot booters on the side of a mountain in the Canadian Rockies. I for one, have no interest in park anymore. I get a big thrill out of cruising around, hitting tree lines, dropping a cliff here and there and cruising through the progression park to throw some 3's on the 20 foot tables. It's all just for fun, I don't give a shit about progressing my park riding, I just wanna be out in the mountains enjoying the snow. I think this is something that is lost a lot, especially with the younger generations of riders who think the only way to enjoy it is with 440 ons and pretzel outs."
snowboarding,3b2uas,heykidsitscox,7,Thu Jun 25 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"I skied for the first 20 years of my life. Then I discovered snowboarding and didn't ski for the next 10 years. I'm getting old now and figured I would get back on skis because it's just less hassle sometimes (flats, getting on and off lifts, etc.). Then two seasons ago I got caught in a surprise powder dump on an awesome Swiss mountain. I was crying. Fucking skis sucked. It would have been the best pow day of my life if I had a snowboard. Any snowboard.  The trip ended and I gave my skis away to the guesthouse owner. I will ride a single plank for the rest of my life.  I think the key to enjoying making turns is the board.

The progression is very rewarding.  A side effect was snowboarding improved my skiing.  When you somehow manage not to fall when you were certain it was going to happen, you realize that those times you thought were on the edge of control (in your case a snowboard) wasn't nearly as close to a crash as you thought.  The day after I first tried boarding I was going much faster and bouncing around much more on my skis."

When I was a teenager I was super into the culture, competed at freestyle events and rail jams etc.   As I get older (I realize i'm still pretty young) I gain more and more appreciation for a nice top speed run and carving around and want to spend less time perfecting my fs bs or hucking my self off of kickers.   Don't get me wrong, the feeling you get from landing a trick you just learned isn't even comparable to the small amount of satisfaction I get from the perfect carve but I can see my self leaving the park behind in a few more years."
snowboarding,3b2uas,n0ah_fense,2,Thu Jun 25 21:12:44 2015 UTC,"35 here. The day all I'm able to do on a snowboard are relaxed carved turns on smooth terrain is the day I quit. I want to jump, spin and ride gnarly terrain for as long as I'm physically able."

snowboarding,3b2uas,sedemon,2,Fri Jun 26 09:03:43 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, where in the world are you? I'm in my 30s, and when I ride in Europe (e.g. France, UK, Italy) I still don't feel like one of the old guys. There are always plenty of people my age and older still shredding hard, both male and female.  Skateparks, on the other hand, I feel like a right old bastard."
snowboarding,3b2uas,spacegrab,2,Fri Jun 26 11:58:14 2015 UTC,"Eastern Canada. There's a pretty strong race boarding scene here. When you don't have powder, you have to learn to carve groomers and ice and carving boards and hard boots is the best way to do it. Guys who ride carving boards are usually in their late 30s and 40s.  The parks are big here too but mostly it's filled with kids.   I'm in my late 40s and I'm usually the oldest guy on a snowboard at any given resort.  I'm in Europe a lot thanks to my work. I ride mostly in Austria. A little bit in Switzerland."

snowboarding,3b2uas,spacegrab,5,Thu Jun 25 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"Once you reach your late 20's and 30's, you can’t ride park and pipe any more. You’re not able to pursue the extreme side of snowboarding anymore. When people really can’t ride, what do they do? They go skiing. That’s one of the elements we overlook–that people get out of the sport.   That paragraph spoke to me too. I turned 30 this year. I can still ride park. I still do - I just don't send it every time I ride. I chase relaxation more than adrenaline now. I'll still go 60mph+ straight-lining down the cornice, and I'll still huck failed backflips off of cliffs as long as I know it's soft down below. I just won't hit the 60ft cheese wedges unless I'm 110% feeling it (perfect snow, no wind) - I find the kiddie park full of 15-30fters is just right.   I ride with by far more skill than when I was 25, but less ballsy and with a higher sense of self-preservation as I can't put myself in the ER again and have to make it to work on Monday.  I know plenty of old fucks (40-50+) that are riding harder than me, but those guys are the passionate ones. I know exponentially more people who have quit riding due to general life issues :("
snowboarding,3b2uas,Overcashed,3,Thu Jun 25 17:15:31 2015 UTC,"The industry keeps chasing the kids though. With shitty park boards that feel squirrelly at speed. Douchey topsheet graphics (if I see another porn star topsheet, I'll puke) and the stupid clothing."
snowboarding,3b2uas,ucopxf,2,Thu Jun 25 17:36:04 2015 UTC,It's always been like that - there aren't enough older people shredding for them to give a fuck :(  I do feel like I've been buying more skier outwear as of late >_<!
snowboarding,3b2uas,spacegrab,3,Thu Jun 25 17:56:16 2015 UTC,But how about some fucking choice. You go to a shop and you can't even find a cambered snowboard. It's all park shit. No stability. So you try to keep up with your ski buddies on your shitty Banana and you can't. So you ditch the board and buy skis. That's pretty much the drill.
snowboarding,3b2uas,ucopxf,2,Thu Jun 25 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"Eh. I still ride mostly cambered directional boards. I don't know what your local shop is like but I've had no problems gearing myself, both with hard & soft goods. IMO gear has improved drastically over the last 10 years, as it always has. Shit is way more tech nowadays and I never worry about my outerwear soaking through. My only beef is with the ultra-long dress-status hoodies. What the fuck why does your hoodie go down to your knees kid?  I only have two friends that switched to skiing. Neither of them can outrun me - the only skier friend I have that can straight-up outrun me is a hardcore backcountry guy who is also like 6""3. If you're having problem chasing skiers, why are you trying to take speed runs on a rockered banana? One of my park boards is cambered for that reason :)"
snowboarding,3b2uas,sedemon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:07:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm definitely not pushing myself as hard as I used to, no huge jumps, no street rails, minimal spin on stuff on rails. I'm still out pressing through kinks, floating 360s and back ones and cruising through the park, and I don't see myself stopping that anytime soon.   I agree with you though about just finding lots of enjoyment in just cruising fast, that may be my most enjoyable part of riding now."
snowboarding,3b2uas,spacegrab,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"As a beginner in my 20s, reading what you guys said are brutal. I hope I had learnt earlier. :("
snowboarding,3b2uas,sedemon,3,Thu Jun 25 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"I started at age 20.  Don't worry - just do what you can while you still can do it. I often wish I had started earlier, as gas was already around $2-3 when I started. Imagine how cheap it would be to hit up a local mountain (<100 miles) on $1/gal gas. But then you realize, when you're young, you don't have much money to do it on your own...especially considering how much gear costs.  I made a lot of sacrifices to my social & work life in order to ride as often/hard as I could. Wouldn't change it for a thing.  Yeah, I'm 30 and my knees are probably fucked, but I'm glad I got it out of my system at a young age. Just cause my park progression all but halted and I don't want to attempt to learn how to stomp a double-cork doesn't mean I'm having less fun. Your perspectives change over the years...I view shredding as more of a relaxation thing now - being able to get away from the office and hang out with my friends on the mountain - whereas I used to say fuck everybody and try to take as many runs as I could. The difference is now that I'm older I can afford more toys (backcountry gear, guns, snowshoes, etc) so I can find fun with a larger variety of activities.  One of my biggest life inspirations was being led on an off-piste tree runs in knee deep pow when I was maybe 22, with a bunch of 40+ y/o dudes from the snow industry (fashion/design side). Seeing how much fun they were having throwing little grabs off tree stumps and shit put a huge smile on my face and I never forgot that feeling."

You also realize doing a lot of that stuff is prone to disaster as you stop riding as much.  I used to be able to spin 10s no problem, but when I stopped riding as much I really didn't want to risk anything like that anymore because I had other responsibilities and if I hurt myself I couldn't attend to them, you also start to realize that taking the hits have more repercussions than they did when you are younger.  It's a mental maturity.  I'm not saying you shouldn't be riding park, but riding becomes a bit more of taking it easy than pushing super hard for a lot of people."

snowboarding,3b2uas,Roisto,3,Thu Jun 25 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"That's the thing for me. I've been snowboarding for 17 years (27 now), and frankly I have a hard time imagining myself carving down the slope at age 50. I guess it's just because there aren't many older snowboarders now.. But when we're all old it'll be common to see an old man buttering and hitting booters."
snowboarding,3b2uas,Roisto,5,Fri Jun 26 12:28:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather see a downhill snowboard event. I think it'd be awesome to see guys just hacking themselves down the same course the skiers take.

I snowboard because it's fun. I've never been big into tricks and jumps and whatever, but I'm getting more into them these days and I'm 32 currently.  I don't think age has anything to do with what you can or cannot or should and shouldn't do. Sure, you might not be able to win the Olympics at an older age, but so what? Do it cuz you enjoy it.  Also don't care what other people think as long as you're having fun and aren't causing any harm to others.  I can't see myself ever switching to skiing for any reason really. I've never really liked any type of skiing but have enjoyed every board sport I've tried so far.  Don't ""grow up"" and become lame, there really is no need for that IMO. And even if you do, that's no reason to switch from snowboarding to skiing. You can be hip and cool and young with skis or a snowboard and you can be old and lame and safe with either one also."

Yes, its competitive but so is every business. I have yet to find a business that is easy money that is worth doing. I agree with a lot of comments on here that to be successful you need to have something that sets your brand apart.

snowboarding,3b2s96,chulksmack360,3,Thu Jun 25 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"Every single pro snowboarder retires and thinks about starting their own snowboard brand. Many turn those thoughts into reality and do it. Most (almost all) fail. Of those who actually deliver a product, the majority either lose money or break even. A lot of the break evens continue for years because they are happy living in their mom's basement and owning a snowboard brand.  The guys who actually succeed are rarer than snow in July. Think about it. What pro snowboarder started their own brand in the last 20 years and succeeded. I can think of one - Jeremy Jones.  So if you are happy making no money but like the lifestyle associated with owning a snowboard brand - go for it. That lifestyle includes working 80 hour weeks and being too exhausted or broke to actually go snowboarding."

snowboarding,3b2s96,Thesnowbelow,0,Thu Jun 25 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"I would like to state maybe one thing that hinders your argument. Which is an alright argument I might add. But, even though pro snowboarders are in the industry through their careers, they may not know the business side of the industry. What kind of capital it takes, the entire process to build a board(f.e. graphic design), the science behind the construction (wood core construction). Etc. They are top tier riders but its the few who constantly ask questions, and say ""what if"" (like Jeremy Jones) who end up making it work. There is potential to start a brand, and be successful, just needs to be done correctly. thats all. Don't read into those who fail to much, the overall failure rate for any business is VERY high."
snowboarding,3b2s96,stuckinthepow,6,Thu Jun 25 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"If I had to bet my own money, I would bet on the person who has a name, industry contacts and experience over someone with a business education but no real experience.  There is not that much science in a snowboard. It's not that hard to build a snowboard. In any event, the smart guys like Jeremy don't build their boards, they contract with OEM manufacturers. Because manufacturing is a fucking nightmare.   If you decide to build your own boards, you better have something very special up your sleeve because you cannot compete with the big brands."
snowboarding,3b2s96,stuckinthepow,-1,Thu Jun 25 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"I fully respect your view. But I would like to point out that you are still banking on a view that you think riders know business. Which is fine. I am sure some do, but not all.  But I'd like to hear others views on getting into the industry rather than the same argument I have heard time and time again. ""It's not possible, the big guys rule the industry"". Thank you for your opinion."

snowboarding,3axz4l,Definitelynotstephen,2,Wed Jun 24 12:02:15 2015 UTC,"This is on locals radar where I live. No one I have spoken to thinks this proposed resort could possibly be economically viable, at least in the near future. Then on top of this they are demonstrating incompetence."
snowboarding,3axz4l,lostshakerassault,2,Wed Jun 24 15:38:50 2015 UTC,Why would it not be economically viable?
snowboarding,3axz4l,hockeycrazy033,4,Wed Jun 24 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"It is in BF nowhere near other resorts, some of which struggle. The possibility of year round sounds good but Whistler has this and it isn't a huge attraction and they are next to a large population and airports."
snowboarding,3axz4l,lostshakerassault,6,Wed Jun 24 16:49:57 2015 UTC,"Let's be real though, Whistler doesn't have that. They have a late season, then re open the hockey rink sized glacier for a month, shut down half of it for private parks, and charge an arm and a leg to ride on it.  The chair up to the glacier opens at 10am IIRC, and you spend the first hour getting up there. You have to take a chairlift, unload, take another chairlift, then take a bus, then take another chairlift.   Jumbo would be legit 12 months of riding, and Olympic teams have shown a lot of interest in that availability. The infrastructure to Jumbo would need to be on point for sure, but I wouldn't put it past Glacier Resorts to try to set up a nearby airport specifically for the resort. Mont Tremblant in eastern Canada has it's own airport for crying out loud, and it's only an hour and a half from Montreal.   Outside of the controversies surrounding native land and resident resistance, my thoughts on this is along the lines of ""if you build it they will come""   Skiing Being seen at a ski resort has always been a big dick thing for rich folks. Bragging to your baffled friends at the country club that you are going skiing in the last week of August is exactly the kind of shit these people get off on. And let's be honest, it's those people with the deep pockets that are going to be the ultimate determinant of if this thing ever comes. Local and provincial political support can be bought like anything else, whether or not it accurately reflects the views of the constituents"
snowboarding,3axz4l,lostshakerassault,3,Wed Jun 24 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"Why do you think the Whistler glacier isn't made very available? I would say because of the lack of demand. Also getting to the Jumbo glacier I don't think would be much easier, and a few olympic teams will not make it economically viable. If the rich folk get off on it they could still go to Whistler, then do a bunch of other fun stuff that Whistler offers in the summer. Or they could go way out of the way and go to somewhere with much less to offer. An airport for the resort? They just built a lodge in an avalanche path (I heard this, I don't know if it is true) and now their environmental certificate has been pulled. The developers are coming across as amateurs in over their heads. If the economic case was really strong we will see someone competent take over. Don't get me wrong a new ski area would be cool. I am not ideologically opposed. The issue of diluting ski dollars in the area even more is my only real objection other than the possibility of having an eyesore of a failed resort. We will see. Me and everyone I have talked to about it could be totally wrong."
snowboarding,3axz4l,lazyanachronist,2,Wed Jun 24 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"I would suppose that the glacier isn't that accessible for a combination of snow conditions and economic viability. Black comb uses a chemical agent to reduce the rate the glacier snow melts in the summer, and they spend that brief window between the end of the season and opening of the glacier to push as much snow as they can to the glacier to help out with building some of the features. That alone is a huge undertaking and cost, which to me is why they have a camp that costs close to $5000 for a week to go to, then still provide the option to buy a COC park pass for a mere $1500. So I definitely agree with you there.   What I meant about the Olympic teams is that it will provide exposure, much the same way COC, High Cascade and any other glacier operations do, by providing pro level exposure.   I think it's hard to stop such a financial juggernaut, especially one that has secured funding for a $450 million project, when they have their eyes on something. There will continue to be a lot of politicking, but In hesitant to dismiss it so easily, especially considering the fight started in 1990.   There are a lot of interests at play. I wouldn't put it past a competing publicly traded company (Whistler Blackcomb) to do everything in their power to stop a resort that has a higher vertical, and three times as much skiable acreage from moving in next door.   You may be right that these investors are knobs, but in my experience people with millions and billions to invest generally got to that level of wealth for a reason. The resort expects to spend $15 to $20 million a year for the next 20 years on construction, and generates $12 million in taxes, plus providing jobs for the area, further boosting the regional economy. If anything stops it I don't think it will be economic viability, but rather competing interests.   Just as a sub note, not trying to be a cock. Just happy to have an engrossing conversation about something other than the importance of hellmits on this sub."
snowboarding,3axz4l,lostshakerassault,2,Wed Jun 24 19:35:50 2015 UTC,"They just built a lodge in an avalanche path   They haven't built anything. They've poured a partial foundation. Where they've planned a day lodge is partially located in a minor avy path, which is normal and allowed. If no control work is done, every so often the side of the building gets a big snow pile. Given control work will be done, it's a non-issue.  http://jumboglacierresort.com/avalanche-exposure-at-jumbo-glacier-resort/"

snowboarding,3ay8kq,AreIII,5,Thu Jun 25 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"This was Sunday 14th June, I'm never too picky about the snow conditions, any trip down is worth it to me but it was all man made snow pretty much. I would keep an eye on the snow cams and social media uploads to get a better idea if the snow is good enough.   Also don't go off Perisher's weather reports/summaries, they always paint it in the best light to get people down there. look at BOM or similar."
