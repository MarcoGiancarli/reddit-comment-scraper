If you dont like to read the descriptions of the images: max stats a horse/donkey/mule can have in minecraft by spawning naturaly or breeding are: 14.5 blocks per second, 30 hp, 5.9 block jump.

Minecraft,3dypdi,winowmak3r,119,Mon Jul 20 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't either until I looked it up. Essentially, a boomerang returns to the thrower because it's shaped very much like a propeller of an airplane. This generates lift but only on one side. When you throw it oriented vertically one side of the boomerang gets more lift than the other because of the airfoil design of the edges so is ""lifted"" to one side and creates the turning. It's actually pretty fascinating stuff.  This pickaxe design works for the same reasons and I'm assuming it's based on a 3-bladed design."

Minecraft,3dypdi,StormyWaters2021,35,Tue Jul 21 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"Stolen from /u/winowmak3r/ :   Essentially, a boomerang returns to the thrower because it's shaped very much like a propeller of an airplane. This generates lift but only on one side. When you throw it oriented vertically one side of the boomerang gets more lift than the other because of the airfoil design of the edges so is ""lifted"" to one side and creates the turning. It's actually pretty fascinating stuff. This pickaxe design works for the same reasons and I'm assuming it's based on a 3-bladed design."

They were probably 4"" wide and 2-3ft long, slightly curved taco ways. A group of kids including myself broke them in half and put the pieces together to make ninja stars or some shit. When we took them out side they curved a lot when you threw them. Turns out if you threw them vertical like a boomerang they acted exactly like a boomerang."

Let us not forget, these updates are FREE.  We aren't owed them.  I get frustrated when people complain about the pace of the updates, when they are developed solely at Mojang's discretion.

To be ""underwhelmed"" or consider a free update ""lacking""....even after it's released....that IMHO is an entitlement mentality.  Please keep in mind that at any point Mojang could stop updating Minecraft, or Microsoft could step in and declare that all future updates will be ""paid DLC.""

Minecraft,3e2qs8,LightWarriorK,2,Tue Jul 21 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying you were saying it was unfair, I was responding to PMMeYourPJs, who said it was ""fair"" to consider 1.9 underwhelming so far....which I don't believe it is.  It's not possible at this point to compare 1.9 to past updates, because we don't all of what's in it.  No matter how long they have taken.    When it comes out, there may be people who are disappointed with the result.  I won't agree, as after nearly 6 years of Minecraft updates I'd be thrilled for even a single feature.  But at this point, to criticize 1.9....it's just too early to tell.  And threads like this that do so sound far too much like complaining about not getting something that you deserve.  Wait.  Be patient.  Play the snapshots.  Judge the results.  Be glad it's not Freemium or Paid DLC."
Minecraft,3e2qs8,Macish,5,Tue Jul 21 18:31:37 2015 UTC,"You said it yourself - They're focusing the update on an area that doesn't appeal to you, therefore you find this particular update to be lacking.  That said, im in the same boat. this update isnt for me. id have loved to have seen new mobs (beyond the Shulker which seems to be more of a 'situational' mob) and some improved mob AI.  I want a mob that only spawns at a specific depth, can phase through blocks and does a metric butt-ton of damage.  For now though, im not unhappy with what ive seen so far, even if it isnt my particular preference"

Minecraft,3e2qs8,samasaurus6,3,Tue Jul 21 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I am a bit disappointed that there will be no entity modelling, entity animation or improved command block GUI.  That said, I imagine that this update will provide a lot of new opportunities, especially for map-makers. One change that has gone slightly unnoticed is the changes to resource packs and the way JSON model files are handled. No more 100s of model files for just the fire animation. This has a benefit for modders who use custom models too, of course!  So yes I can understand the frustration, but I'm sure everyone will be a lot happier once they get their hands on what's in store."

Minecraft,3e2qs8,myketronic,5,Tue Jul 21 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Nobody raging here, opinions should be respected.  My opinion is similar regarding PVP - I don't have a personal taste for it.  However, I've this perspective: The last one.5 years have been slow, if you look strictly at version numbers changing.  Looking at the bigger picture, every update since 1.5 has required re-writing core code that is somewhat less pleasant to work with than razor-wire.  On top of that, there have been internal changes in Mojang (due to acquisition) that have jammed up the gears.  So, while I don't care for the PVP aspects of the update, I gratefully welcome Mojang engaging and listening to the Minecraft community when it comes to a very old request: rebalance PVP for a better overall experience.  It seems simple, but this really is a hard and mostly thankless task.  Some people want dual-wielded nuclear-explosive-firing machine guns and some people want only sword mechanics.  As a small server owner, there has been a fair amount of turbulence in the last year, so I welcome a slow-down to ensure a well-written & stable server+plugin ecosystem.  I was looking over my updates from 2012 & 2013 - there were a crazy amount of changes in that time - now they're paying the price for it as they have to ensure they don't break all that stuff already in place (or re-write & fix it when they do)."

It does feel a little underwhelming for the time it's taking to get to us. 3-4 months? Nah, I wouldn't say it's worth that small of a timeframe but maybe 6 months worth. I do think a huge factor in this is that they were dealing with the Microsoft acquisition and transition a good portion of the year, so that took a way a lot from developing an update. They announced a lot of Windows and holo lens stuff this year so that was likely a big chunk of resources to organize and manage that."

Minecraft,3dxi3r,Magib1,66,Mon Jul 20 10:15:12 2015 UTC,"I've added in basic scrolling/movement to my Pokemon Red recreation.  A brief explanation of what's happening:  All of the background textures are custom maps.  In the spawn chunks there is a (very large) physical representation of the entire Pokemon Red overworld, with each block corresponding to a separate map texture.  An armor stand moves along this physical map and, whenever the tries to move (by using inventory slots rebound to arrow keys) the blocks for the newly loaded maps are cloned behind the map display.  The item frames loading the new tiles then ""read"" the block type and display the appropriate map, and the remaining frames get shifted up/down/left/right by a block.  In order to store easily accessible information I'm also creating a sort of physical database underneath the block map.  For example, the first layer under the map represents whether the block can be walked on or not (green wool = yes, red wool = no).  Separate levels with this type of binary information can be created for doorways, surfable tiles, signs, etc.  This cuts down on the command blocks needed, as lag is a very serious concern for the map.  Image of the physical map: http://i.imgur.com/eyB7O9U.png  The textures in that map don't serve any purpose aside from assisting me in creating the map in-game.  I can include them in the final map as an optional download, but they don't serve any functional purpose.  Let me know if you have any questions!"

Minecraft,3dxi3r,billybob884,3,Mon Jul 20 16:21:53 2015 UTC,No armor stands for the map interface itself - item frames are entities so you actually don't need to tie them to another entity to enable executes.  Plus item frames do not play well with other entities (unfortunately).  I do have the basics for the chat overlay set up and that uses blocks on the heads of armor stands for the characters since there are way too many possible permutations to use maps.

Could you make it so that when you're on the very right edge of the map and the player presses right, the player x gets updated rather than the map moving? or something like that? that way you don't see a bunch of black on part of the screen.  of course, this would also apply to the left edge, bottom edge, and top edge.  since you're doing this in minecraft, I'm not exactly sure how you would do that, but outside of minecraft, it would be pretty easy to code, in an actual language."
Minecraft,3dxi3r,Michael23B,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:15 2015 UTC,The black is really just a placeholder - I added the black recognition while waiting for a flight so when I get back I'll have to see how the actual game handles this.  The goal is to have this mimic the actual Pokemon Red game as much as possible.
Minecraft,3dxi3r,EpikYummeh,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't messed around with ROMs lower than Silver/Gold ones, but it's highly likely R/B/Y would use the same system - each map has a border block assigned which is 2x2 tiles (in R/S/E) or 1 2x2 block (G/S/C) and it tiles over the ""empty space"". Sea maps get water, outside maps get trees or sometimes rocks, caves get rocks and indoor maps get the black void (although it's still a tile in the tileset). I remember trying to make a game with Gold's assets in RPG Maker XP and I remember that that engine did the thing /u/Michael23B  suggested - moving the player off center if a border is reached. It's ugly in my opinion, and I remember not being able to rewrite the engine to fill the void instead so I gave up eventually. Now I have a barely started implementation of the game in C# and there it works, but there are so many interesting tricks used in the games that aren't noticeable unless you use cheats/disassemble the ROM.  For instance, in G/S/C the walk through walls cheat didn't work well in caves because there a special tile was used that blocked the player's way in a different way (I am talking about the tiles where you could walk on top of but they were part of the wall), as all other tiles were either passable or not. As far as I remember there are tiles with similar behaviour in Goldenrod and Saffron (seats in the train station), and they are also solid with the noclip cheat on."
Minecraft,3dxi3r,Slaker_Kanston,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"You don't necessarily have to move the player off center to keep the entire map on the screen (no empty spaces), but that would disable the player from going in [N] spaces (N being however many x,z (or x,y, depending on how you look at it) coordinates there are between the edge of the screen and the center).  so if you had, say, 5 coordinates that weren't on center, and the player HAS to stay on center, then that would mean that you have a 5 block thick wall, or in other words, 5 blocks that the player couldn't move on.  However, that's not a good method, in my op. moving the player off center would look much better."

Minecraft,3dxi3r,ekovv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"Not many. AI will be garbage, but the battle system in the original games is trivial. Each attack has an accuracy check, followed by a damage value(0 for pure stat affecting things), you subtract that from the enemy defense, add your attack value,multiply based on type weakness both for type one and type two(2 for weakness, .5 for resist, 0 for immune) then apply that result to the enemy's health. If enemy heath is 0, move on to next Pokemon. If no more Pokemon left, add money to players money and output a hardcoded message(that part might be tricky)  Speed is a binary check that can be done at the start of the phase.  Sleep and paralysis are simple checks at the start of each phase. Sleep can be precalvulated as a random number of turns to remove itself when it is first applied. Burn and poison are just removing a certain percentage of health each phase. Confusion is a bit tricky, but it can be done.  The damage, type, and accuracy can easily be put in a block database.   The real bitch I'd going to be having the hardcoded data for trainers. You're going to need a ROM hack or something. As Magib1 mentioned, text is also going to be an issue."

If so, they can make merchandise off of the youtuber's skin (i.e. shirts and action figures). Otherwise, the original skin creator could possibly claim it was copyright infringement.  Speaking of copyright infringement, I think the reason why the avatar of SkyDoesMinecraft only says ""Sky"" is because they can't use the word Minecraft without directly signing a deal with Minecraft/Mojang/Microsoft. Things like AntVenom's gold apple/diamond sword, CaptainSparklez's slime and ExplodingTNT's... TNT have been altered so they don't look like the Minecraft counterparts.

It's easy to follow his tutorials as well as understanding the idea that builds are just as much basic maths are they are creativity. After that TheVoxelBox are also good for understanding how colours, lines and shapes also work into a build.  Secondly knowing some tricks also helps, websites like Minecraft Furniture and the subreddit r/detailcraft help greatly in this area.  The last thing I can recommend is ""The Giagantic Guide for Building"", it has a huge number of links that cover different areas of Minecraft building.  Minecraft building isn't a talent, it's a skill, something you learn, best of luck to you and I hope you make something awsome.

I've been playing since the beginning, and I still collect pics of great builds for inspiration.  And not just from Minecraft, either.  IRL Structures, Deviant Art works, blueprints, etc.  There are actually NO unique ideas.  Even ideas people think are theirs and unique are either based off of something they've seen (even in their unconscious memory) or a deviation/derivative thereof.    But as others have said, creativity is a skill, not something that comes naturally.  Naturally, those like myself who have been playing with Legos, Construx, Lincoln Logs, and Erector Sets our whole lives, or who have had schooling in IRL applications like Planning, Architecture, or Engineering....yes, it'll seem like we have some magical naturally ability, but it's really just been developed over time, and with LOTS and LOTS of practice.  So that's my recommendation is to just....Play Minecraft.  Don't worry about whether you're being creative, just build and let the juices flow.  Try to incorporate things you've seen that you like into your builds.  Then move on and build again.  The more you play, the better your builds will become.  And enjoy it! :D"

Actually, that is a large part of how learning to build works. The other one is experimenting. You can't create something out of nothing, you need a source, an idea. Your mind can't create an idea out of nothing, you need inspiration. Just keep looking for good builds, copy them, modify to your likings until you get your own, perfect building.  If you have problems with building, try to do it in small steps. Maybe add logs or bricks in the wall corners, add some unusual windows, force yourself to build a bigger/smaller house, adapt to the terrain. There are many ways. Minecraft does not just make you creative. At first, it requires creativity, it drains it from you, then leaves you with a miserable building which you then need to expand using all your ideas and inspiration. I suggest you checking my reddit profile to see if you can find something intresting."

One that utilises the new blocks and resource packs. One that can do freaky-lost-style-stuff using command blocks. Imagine going to the Black Rock to find tnt, going down a ladder into the hatch (that actually looks like the swan station) and realising that the creator actually made a timer that when it ticks down causes the hatch to explode unless you input the numbers.

Minecraft,3dy4yo,SamueI_Andeson,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"The description is pretty much all in the album.   I made the thief device as a way to empty the inventory of a villager I had been using for breeding. Then I got an idea and built this farm. I think the redstone is very simple compared to other villager farms. Also because the villager is so diligent in his farm work, it's incredibly effecient, he harvests as fast as his little villager feet can carry him to the newly matured crops  This farm is 9x27, but one farmer can plant and harvest this whole field and still end up waiting around for crops to grow, so I know it can be made larger, probably double the size. I have made a 31x31 farm in a creative world, but it seems it may be a bit large as his path-finding sometimes leaves him lost in a corner or ignoring crops on the outer edges of the farm.  I have a few things I think could be improved. First if I could reduce the horizontal footprint of the BUD switch it would allow more farmland to be placed closer to the harvest house.  Second, sometimes the villager falls when the piston retracts, and stomps the farmland. It does not happen too often, but at times I will have to re-till the soil on the thief plot. I have tried half slabs, fence posts, iron bars, and glass panes placed one block above the planting block, but they all stop him from planting. I've tried signs, but they did not keep him from falling.   Finally, you'll notice my breeding chamber is very close to the farm, I'm sure I could add some switch activated mechanism to allow the farmer to throw food to the villagers, but I haven't worked on that yet.   I hope people find this useful, and I hope maybe some of you can help make this thing perfect."

I've been rebuilding this all morning (lol, I've only been up for about an hour) but I wanted to test something and I think I have it. A piston can push the villager out of the block of the farmland. I'm sure the redstone could be done better, so if you want to try to rebuild it then have at it!"

It may slightly slow down the rate he plants, although he's pretty quick, so the tradeoff is worth it.  I'm trying to figure out from your images why your BUD didn't auto-reset. The piston with the redstone block should be a sticky piston. It's a SethBling design BUD. IIRC though I think it becomes a timer with a normal piston.  The repeater in my design is only there to separate the redstone signals so the 'dot' under the block doesn't connect with the wiring of the farm piston."

Do you understand, even remedially, what it means when a repost is upvoted and welcomed?  I'll spell it out. I can tell you're having trouble with all this. Basically, it means that despite being a repost, it gets a popular welcome by people who missed it every time before. If a subreddit doesn't have a rule about only welcoming exclusively new and original content, I don't see why you have a problem with the user.  I actually have seen this before, though. It isn't new to me. But I like it and I still upvoted it anyway. I imagine people like me are the bane of your existence.  Is Reddit karma equivalent to currency? Will he get fame from all the karma he gets from reposts? First of all, he wouldn't get any karma from reposts if people didn't like and upvote them. Secondly, if you could get something from Reddit karma, then he sounds smart to be getting all that karma. Thirdly, karma doesn't actually have any value, so your concerns are moot."
Minecraft,3dtwlt,joanzen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"It's because on noob subs, people think that it's OC, and waste time upvoting content that will eventually be essentially deleted. Better to start getting people informed on how reddit works now vs. many wasted upvotes later.  When you want to see the best content, sort by best. If we have a ton of upvotes on reposts, how's that going to work if we don't task mods with hiding the reposts? Right. Why make the mods do all the work? Right!"

Minecraft,3e2nkt,adog97,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:28 2015 UTC,"Food for thought:   Lacking an intro and outro The stage name ""Adog Supreme"" sounds exceedingly conceded and is worth review Tons of background noise.  A modest investment in a quality mic would help a lot Describing your own work as ""AWESOME"" also sounds exceedingly conceded (I'm detecting a theme here) You regularly make a sucking/smacking sound after dramatic pauses.  You'll want to overcome this habit. Your keyboard noise is slightly louder than your voice audio.  You'll likely want to invest in a click-less keyboard for recording. Recording at night is always a bad idea, unless you're demonstrating night lighting (in which case, it's ideal to have a short video cut to night for that purpose).  Recording in the rain is also a bad idea.  You have control over both of these conditions.  Failing to adjust the scene is just laziness. You tempt the viewer with a spectacular jump, but then don't deliver.  Be careful what you setup, since viewer expectation is important. ""Strip mining"" is when you remove the top layer of the ground.  What you're doing is better described as ""Branch mining"".  Using the correct terms in a video series is useful to us all."

Minecraft,3dxeyd,Cratain,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"In advance, I'm incredibly sorry for how long and ramble-y this post may be - but seeing you asking for ideas on what to do at a LAN setting is an opportunity I never thought would come.  So, I guess, hi, if you're reading this, important Mojang person.  I am a non-Important person by the name of Cratain.  I'm a 19 year old US competitive player.  Hoping that didn't cause you to burst out laughing and leave, I'm going to go on.  I'm not a server owner, I'm not coming here to promote a network - I'm a player who has been trying very hard to see a certain idea come to fruition - and that is Competitive Minecraft.  A few months ago, gathering together a few friends who had played on various competitive servers with me, I launched a sub-reddit known as r/competitiveminecraft (which you can read more about here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveMinecraft/comments/32athb/welcome/).  Our goal was, and continues to be, to create a defined competitive community, to support players with ideas of what ""competitive Minecraft"" is, and to grow what following there already is of the concept.  So many players immediately cast away the block-game that Minecraft is - enamored with the shiny sword they have just crafted, and the bow they killed their first spiders to make.  For a few years now, people have developed servers around these swords and bows - all of which are valid, but all of which, to me, missed the point of Minecraft.  Games are not always made to be competitive - some just become what they are because a few players find interesting aspects of the game - bugs - and use them to create things: Metagames, tiers of characters, compendiums of strategies.  Minecraft?  It blows these other games away.  Unlike other games, Minecraft players have the freedom not only to influence the game they play, they have the ability to create their own vision of the game itself - it is not a matter of balancing a meta once someone has the idea to play it competitively - it is a process in which players from all around the world are free to add to or even create their own gamemode, something which, to this day, blows my mind.  On a server I have played, (which I will not mention to avoid advertising), tournaments have happened with up to 1500 players and 80 teams at a time.  And the fights were not mindless loops of sword and bow encounters.  They were tactical.  Everyone sat down and looked at the maps they were given.  They spent hours perfecting their cannons.  They discovered block mechanics, glitches, player spreads, counter-strats - whatever they could to increase their chances of victory.  Once they engaged, they created and destroyed, attacked and endured.  At every moment, they franticly fought foremost with thoughts - turning the tides of encounters with not the sharpness of swords, but the sharpness of wits.  All actions were rewarded for their pragmatism and creativity.  To me, these players embodied the spirit of Minecraft - the spirit of a sandbox game.  Zombies, Skeletons, even Ender Dragons no longer pose much threat - killing them is mechanical, the application of known methods, in the same way, over and over again.  The real challenge, to me, is in facing players.  Constantly looking for the moves they make.  Constantly wondering what they are doing and thinking.  Constantly wondering what they are planing with that block or item.  To this day playing, there has been no greater thrill for me than my moments problem-solving my way out of a panicked situation against a group of skilled opponents, alongside a group of skilled friends.  What I want so much is to share this experience with the greater Minecraft community.  What I want is to see everyone join in, constantly endeavoring to outsmart their competitors, to surpass their previous concepts of how to best play the game at hand - and a LAN event could do so much to get that to happen (so much that I did a double take when I was first told there was a thread where you brought it up).  So, please, Mr. Important Mojang person, if you have read this, hear me out.  I realize it must seem stupid, but it is something I believe can be done - and it is something I will keep trying to do, even if you don't see this, or even if you do and decide it does not interest you.  Please tell me what I can do to show you this is viable.  Please, tell me how I can see this plan come to fruition, and see a competitive match at the next Minecon.  Thank you so much for your time, your consideration, and your wonderful game!  Sincerely, Cratain"

They have a bunch of alternative skins for some mobs, and a mechanic to select from them, so it will be in the game sometime in the future.

I used netherrack as the primary building material (only inside the room, of course), a small yet fake nether fortress into the wall, and lava flowing down another wall and into a small lake.  The build required a couple hours of collecting in the nether, and you would never know it was there from other rooms.  It was like having a mini nether in your house, and if a zombie pigman walked through accidentally, he would feel right at home. edit: grammar errors"

To summarize:   It's not strictly forbidden to submit links to videos of yours, but please only do so in a moderate amount. If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it, you're almost certainly a spammer. As a rule of thumb, for every post promoting your own video(s), you should have made 10 other submissions or comments on other posts. (Bear in mind that pointless comments like ""nice"" and ""lol"" do not count as actual contribution.) If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of your own videos, and additionally if you do not participate in this community in other ways, for example by submitting other content or joining the discussion on other posts, you are a spammer. If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours, and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway, they're probably spam.   For right now, this is just a friendly message, but here in /r/Minecraft, we take action against anyone that fits the above definition."

I have seen one (i forgot the name of it) which lets you see the inventory of a storage space, such as a chest, by looking at it instead of opening it, therefore saving time when looking for what you need.  I think this one was 1.7.10.  The other main one I can think of off the top of my head is the glass shards mod for 1.8, which allows you to break glass and have them drop shards with a chance, which you can either smelt to make back into glass or you can craft a sword with them.  Another nice feature of the latter mod is how you can also craft glass surrounding a gunpowder to turn stained glass back into normal glass."

I do know that 1.7.10 and 1.8 forge had an update fairly recently, I want to say it was about a couple months ago.   Edit: I just looked it up.  They last updated on july 16, but it is not the current recommended one."
Minecraft,3e0bdt,Pyroki617,0,Mon Jul 20 23:48:34 2015 UTC,"It's a shame, really. I wish they go back to active development when 1.9 arrives."
Minecraft,3e0bdt,renadi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing something, they are having to do a major rewrite for 1.8 and are actively work on it, but the rewrite is all background stuff so it doesn't result in new versions of forge for us to use, there are still 1.8 versions of forge, and there will be more in the future.  I don't quite understand why you think there should be something higher than 1.8 when minecraft hasn't gone past 1.8 yet even..."
Minecraft,3e0bdt,Slikrick98,2,Tue Jul 21 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"The only real rewriting being done in forge itself is the fml/forge merge. Which is done, just kinda haphazardly.  ForgeGradle 2 is what forge was waiting for to update to 1.8.7.  Forge has only slowed down its updates because Lexmanos just got home from a small vacation after minecon. I believe he will work on the 1.8.7 update."

In the .minecraft folder, under the logs subfolder, you'll find a set of dated logfiles named in the style yyyy-mm-dd-1.log.gz  You can open these gzipped archives and read the text logfile inside yyyy-mm-dd-1.log and if command-line cheats were used they will show up here as [CHAT] responses (you can't see the actual commands that were typed).

Minecraft,3dzm1t,mynameisperl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"Back when I started programming, many textbooks assumed that their readers came from a hardware background and they referred to circuits and programs almost interchangeably.  Both disciplines are analytical in nature, and that's what is required to design and construct redstone contraptions."
Minecraft,3dzm1t,davinci10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy making devices using redstone gates, such as linking multiple inputs to multiple outputs using logic gates, recreating computer components like adders, decoders, and MUXs, and creating large systems of several components together, that's more computer engineering.  On the other hand, if you're making other sorts of redstone contraptions that don't necessarily use just gates but nonetheless perform interesting functions, I'd say that's more akin to electrical or mechanical, depending on what it is.  The short answer is gates = computer engineering.  I just graduated in CmpEn two months ago, and small scale logic circuits (those involving gates and decoders) are key to early CmpEn courses.  Then as you go on you get into more intricate circuits until you're designing whole CPUs in VHDL or Cadence.  The line between EE, CmpEn, and CmpSc is indeed blurry, and varies between schools.  Generally though, a CmpSc program will emphasize algorithms and discrete math (proving that a certain algorithm works), EE will cover microelectronics and signals (lots of trig, differential equations, and circuit analysis), and CmpEn will bridge the two by discussing both circuits, software, and how computers work at their lowest level."
