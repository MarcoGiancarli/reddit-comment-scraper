Also would a Japanese soldier carry a loaded weapon in peace time ?"
Humanoidencounters,3dzqbn,SpastixFantastix,4,Mon Jul 20 21:22:54 2015 UTC,"I can answer the last one, I think.  He may have been doing guard duty on base.  Also, it's not unheard of for soldiers to have loaded weapons on base.  Finally, I'm pretty sure he was not Japanese.  His name was Pvt Sinclair Taylor.  I'm guessing American since America has had bases on Japanese soil since WWII.  ETA: I am going to guess that some of the other issues you mentioned have more to do with the person taking the report/the retelling of the tale than anything else.  Even the reporter says the bit about glowing eyes may have been an embellishment beyond Taylor's initial report."

I never saw it's body because I couldn't see down past it's chin. I just made the assumption that for this thing to be where it was it had to be standing. It could have been a floating head. It could have been a ghost. All I have is round light-colored hairless thing with face-like features.  The test to see if I imagined it came the following night. I wanted to see if it was there again after all the conditions were recreated. The fact that I could see the rest of my room the second night told me that something was definititively there."

Humanoidencounters,3da38n,sniggity,12,Tue Jul 14 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"The beings in these encounters are always described as very angry when they are seen or discovered. I wonder if that's the actual emotion they feel, an anthropocentric misinterpretation, or if it's just theater.  But the ""NOOO"" in this story struck me as particularly interesting. I usually interpret the anger as some sort of rule being broken - like they're not supposed to be seen, and now they'll get in trouble. But this story made me take it a bit further. It seems like true despair over a more ultimate, irreversible type of failure.  Then I remembered an encounter I recently read in a Jacques Vallee book, I can't recall which one but maybe someone here does. It was about a little humanoid who expressed such regret at being discovered, because now it was trapped somehow in our reality, having become fully corporeal or something due to being observed.  Our conscious awareness (or the awareness of certain people among us) is more powerful than we know, I think."
Humanoidencounters,3da38n,ASK47,4,Wed Jul 15 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"Really good point.

I remember a story similar to the one you mentioned, I have to search my archives for it.  I know I have it some where.  But yeah, this story really struck me as interesting and it even had an eerily sad undertone to it regarding it screaming ""NO NO NO"".  Makes you wonder."

Not that that creature bartered anything to do just that,  perhaps it's a shape shifter or sumn..

Since they are there in his personal photobook, it's pretty good evidence that he hoaxed them himself.  And that calls into question all the rest of his pictures.  He later claimed that these dino pics were inserted by the MIB, but if they were, wouldn't he have known that before he let people film his photobook?  I can guarantee you that if I'd taken some pics of actual dinosaurs, I'd remember them in vivid detail, and notice the moment some strange new ones got inserted.  But he tried to pass these off as if they were legit and only came up with the 'well the MIB did it' angle after the ruse was discovered.  So does that absolutely mean all of his pics are faked?  No.  But it does mean that we can have no faith that they are not.  It renders all of his 'evidence' tainted."

I'll be honest, I never gave it too much credence until I started reading Missing 411 books by David Paulides.  There are just way too many people going missing with absolutely no trace in our parks.  The ones that they do find traces of all have the same M.O. They are without shoes, clothing and are either found near berry patches, boulders and caves and swamps or their clothing is found in those spots.  The people that are found have no memory of what happened to them most of the time, yet they all seem to be fed and hydrated by someone or something.    Given that, I think whatever is doing this is probably these creatures and they either live below or up above in space.  But I have to say that I feel they live deep underground.  What are they?  That's the question."

It was one of the most bizarre things I've ever read and belongs in this his collection.   In short, a young child goes missing in a national park and a search ensues. As many of these stories go, they eventually find the child right in the middle of a trail they had been using all day; like the child was placed there after some time. Now the weird part: the child is alive and recounts what happened. They claimed that another ""robot mommy"" disguised as their own mom kidnapped them and brought them to a cave. The child was aware that this was a robot or something mimicking its real mother. Definitely one of the weirdest ones I've come across. Gives me goosebumps still."

I catch a glimpse of him just as he's starting to yawn.  The yawn goes on and on, and the freaky thing is that his mouth just kept opening wider and wider the whole time.

From Wikipedia:  As part of a study on adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were introduced to the island of Desecheo and other southern off-shore islands and cays in 1967. Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_of_Puerto_Rico#Mammals"

Humanoidencounters,3bbsef,ReturnOfCaptainSwing,2,Mon Jun 29 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've read other accounts where the witness said they were military looking men, their hair was high and tight, mid 30's wearing coveralls."
Humanoidencounters,3bbsef,SpastixFantastix,2,Mon Jun 29 16:34:57 2015 UTC,"Have you ever read the encounter where the guy was shooting at the craft when all of a sudden a hatch opens up and a human looking man yells down at him, ""stop shooting at us you idiot !""? Lol"
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,sniggity,6,Thu Jun 25 18:22:15 2015 UTC,Most of this video is just rehash of other popular videos and toward the end they just replay some of the same stuff from the beginning.
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,chewieconcarne,2,Thu Jun 25 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of duplicate stuff in this."

I'm highly interested in those creepy tall pale skinny motherfuckers with the black eyes. I've seen them referred to as wendingos, tall-whites, the rake, even nephilim - I dunno what they really are or what to call em.  Crazy to see footage of them, whether that footage is real or not - I can't say. Either way I'm creeped out."
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,Hhonkers,4,Thu Jun 25 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"No shit, these things are just way too creepy.  I couldn't imagine bumping into one.  Like that girl that saw one at a rest stop.  You ever read that story?"
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,SpastixFantastix,2,Fri Jun 26 03:21:25 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely - thats ones great.  I actually posted it in this thread recently.
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,SpastixFantastix,3,Fri Jun 26 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"I just started watching.  The first one could be a statue or something on a grave.  I dunno.  It's kind of weird looking when they go for a zoomed view, but with very little context, who knows.    ETA: OK wait just now seeing it moving.  Yet did not notice any of this in the distant original view.  I don't know what to make of it.   ETA more: OK the third one was actually on 20/20 or one of those news shows.  The guy thought he was being stalked by aliens."
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,Frightened_Peasant,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:52:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the original one really has me wondering, because when that guy saw it he jumped with genuine fear."
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,Frightened_Peasant,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:22:56 2015 UTC,"I kept a little running commentary as I watched, typing stuff into notepad. The alien in the chat window amused me because of the other guys' reactions. The zombie in the trailcam one, the original is so blurred, how can they see ribs in the close-up?  They got something where there was nothing there.  Suspicious to me (also the ribs are weirdly placed and I don't believe in the walking dead).    The rest are a lot of the usual you see everywhere.  A few I hadn't seen but a lot seem to be CG.  Still kind of fun to look at, I guess.  I just am bugged by people who fake this stuff because it makes the potential real stuff have more hurdles to have to deal with."
Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,chapisbored,2,Fri Jun 26 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't believe anything I see on youtube.  It is way too easy to trick people these days, especially that trailcam crap.

Humanoidencounters,3b3n2i,Ghyllie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:25:03 2015 UTC,"I can't even imagine driving home from work listening to Radiohead.  :p    My one main argument against that video, other than my brain protesting that a creature like that cannot possibly exist, is that last car in the video should have seen the thing and reacted, but it drove on by like the creature wasn't there."
Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,financethrowaway1111,8,Wed Jun 24 06:33:17 2015 UTC,Your's is one of the most convincing stories I've read regarding cryptids/humanoids. Very Intriguing. In what year did it occur?

Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,sniggity,2,Wed Jun 24 09:25:32 2015 UTC,"Even just a rough sketch would be good.  I couldn't stop picturing a hairy snake with legs but I am fairly certain that's not like what you saw.    I also wonder about the true size.  I am 42 and have trouble estimating sizes of things.  When you're a kid things seem much bigger, especially weird things."
Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,SpastixFantastix,2,Wed Jun 24 14:29:54 2015 UTC,"I've thought about that, too, The size issue, I mean.  I base my estimate off of the relative size of the dog I had with me, a young (but almost fully grown) portuguese water dog, which was (if I'm remembering correctly), less than half as long as the thing, and far narrower. I'm working on a (very) rough sketch of the whole creature right now."
Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,GraphicDesignMonkey,4,Wed Jun 24 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this creature sounds like a Chupacabra.  I'm not talking about those weird looking dogs in Texas, I'm talking about the original Chupacabra that were seen everywhere in Puerto Rico during the 90's ! Although, the one difference being is the hair color.  I'd love to see a sketch of this bad boy !  Edit: ok I see ur ms paint.  This is definitely a weird looking creature.  The sketch looks kinda like the face of a fly or something.  Where was this again?"

Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,aazav,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your post, it definitely fits here. If you delve into the subject, maybe read through a few years of Albert Rosales' humanoid encounter database, you'll find plenty of similar cases. I'm a scientist too, with strong biology experience. I know how you feel."
Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,naturalexas,0,Fri Jun 26 14:40:03 2015 UTC,"I used to live in southern Westchester County as a kid! Anyways, from what your describing, I'm not getting anything humanoid. You're basing the humanoid aspect on it looking like it couldn't be quadrupedal I suppose. This thing is striking me more so as a deformed ""something"" rather than an unknown species. Especially if it looks like something tried to mess it up it makes me think it had an owner who wanted it dead, or it was ostracized from it's family.  I'm thinking a deformed deer or horse, even though I know claws don't jive with hoofs. Bear, raccoon, ferret, fox, weasel, or someone's pet wallaby or even a kangaroo ( the difference in limbs, spiny projections as whiskers) possibly with part of a conjoined twin around the head region to account for eye placement and strange facial features. But you're the scientist so you can evaluate these as possibilities. Thanks for sharing!"

Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,SlothFactsBot,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:51:31 2015 UTC,"I think a sketch will help us understand better your description of this creature. Before reading you were a biologist, the first thing that came to my mind was the image of a sloth. I have seen them without hair and with scarce patches of hair and they look out of this world. Maybe Google ""bald sloth"" to see if it fits your description. Anyway, please; share a sketch with us! Thanks for sharing!"
Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,HalfUgly,9,Wed Jun 24 09:27:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry to double reply, but I've just finished a very, very, very rough MS painting of what its whole face would look like, assuming it's bilaterally symmetrical, not a freakish animal that went through a tragic mutation and somehow survived, even thrived, into adulthood. I hope it conveys how alien and definitely-not-a-sloth it seems/seemed to me.  http://i.imgur.com/kbk0rfj.png"
Humanoidencounters,3axb8c,SlothFactsBot,5,Wed Jun 24 10:53:22 2015 UTC,"And of course now that I'm looking at it zoomed out I realize that I fucked up where the eyes I could see were in relation to one another. They were in a Y configuration, not a an M, if that makes any sense. I knew my MS paint drawing didn't quite look right. I kept adding more labels to try to fix whatever was throwing me off, and missed what was (almost literally) staring me in the face. That's what happens when I mock things like this up. Just imagine the bottom set of eyes being approximately one and a half inches closer to the middle, directly on either side of the patches of different colors, sort of nestled into a nook surrounded on 120 degree by them,  while the upper ones are about 1/2 an inch further from the middle.   This is why I preemptively apologized for it coming out terribly. Because I'm terrible. I also can't really explain why I thought it would be smarter to make it in that color than, y'know, the color the thing I'm trying to represent is."

Humanoidencounters,3ausqk,SpastixFantastix,3,Wed Jun 24 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"This one is really interesting, the strange thing is that the creature didnt react at them at all like flying or running away at first contact and didnt even bother to attack them"
Humanoidencounters,3ausqk,wolve40,3,Wed Jun 24 01:26:43 2015 UTC,Reminds me of a dragon. And seems similar to that Yoda like creature someone else posted a few days ago. Could it be the same creature as the 'Jersey Devil'?

It seems to be more in the PA/WV/VA area. It was...well...not uncommon to here stories of people seeing him/her/it.  It could very well be aliens as well. In that area (western/west central PA) it's accepted that UFO sightings happen often. Growing up I heard of a lot of townies describing encounters with UFO's. My grandmother even said she saw an alien and a UFO once. But then again, maybe all rural areas are like this."

It used to be said that because he only has one arm he couldn't be faking.

I remember something about claims of a nearby cave they say these creatures came from. If I'm not mistaken, (I haven't gone back to try to remember this source at all) these individuals were convinced of this cave being where they had come from. My question now is... Where is this cave and why have I not heard further updates? When stories as big as this one go stale, I get.... Suspsicous I guess."

I don't know that it's possible for something (not self propelled) to stay behind a planet at all times to the point it was not visible from here.  Unsure if I am making sense and I'm not a scientist.    That said, if a ship came down next to me and said, ""Don't be frightened,"" it would not help me not be frightened.

Humanoidencounters,39lqj1,MrsGriebe,5,Fri Jun 12 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, it sounds to me that he may have encountered a family of Sasquatch.  I've heard of many accounts where people had the drop on one of them, but just couldn't take the shot.  In fact, Will Jevning, who is an ex member of the radio show Sasquatch Chronicles stated that he was within 15 to 20 feet from 2 of them and couldn't bring himself to aim at them, so he shot in the air.  That's just one account, I know of at least a few more.  I also know of a few people who say they actually have shot and killed them ! So, unless there is a body or good video, the credibility is solely placed upon witness credibility.  But this is definitely an interesting encounter.  If you can ask the guy who had this encounter if he'd be interested in speaking with me, I'd appreciate it !  Thanks again."
Humanoidencounters,39lqj1,sniggity,3,Fri Jun 12 21:48:57 2015 UTC,"At first I thought it was in the Sasquatch family as well. However, the way he described them made them seem more extra-terrestrial, probably because they seemed to weightless and telepathic.  I can't really get into it, but I definitely cannot talk to him. Not only will he have nothing to do with me, but if he did his wife would probably do something awful out of a jealous rage.

Went camping when I was 17 with my friends and the ROTC instructor from our school. The guy was 53 and the biggest badass I have ever met, tough as nails. Well, we are coming back from town and driving down this long dirt road in the mountains. My friends and I were in the back of his truck and he slammed on the breaks. We look over the top of the cab and this animal was walking across the road. It looked like a coyote but was walking on its hind legs. After it crossed, it let out this god awful screeching sound. When we got to the camp site, the ROTC guy made us pack up and leave. He has been all over the place with the army and has seen some crazy shit, but whatever we saw scared him to his core.

Humanoidencounters,39gy90,sniggity,12,Tue Jul 14 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"This one from r/askreddit is good too.   My friend and I were driving on a road parallel to the Trans Canada Highway, surrounded by farms. It was about 1 o'clock in the morning, clear summer night with lots of moon light when we realized this thing was in middle of the road. I say thing because I have no idea wtf is could be. Neither of us noticed it in the road, we thought it was dirt because it wasn't moving. When we got maybe 6 feet away we saw shadow an realized something was there. It appeared to be a couple feet tall, sitting on its hind legs and had large ears I can only describe as very similar to bat ears. It was covered in short golden blonde (like a golden retriever) hair and had a stubby snout and the most unnerving part was the giant black non reflective eyes. My friend slammed on the breaks and that thing ran into the long grass in the ditch beside the road. Neither of us had an explanation. We continued driving and went around a corner. This is where things get really weird. About 30 seconds later we see a pair of head lights come around the corner. My friend is a car buff and likes to guess vehicles, so we were looking at the headlights fairly closely. We noticed there was no yellow or red lights, just headlights. We were driving for about a minute when, I swear I'm not lying, the lights moved vertical on top of each other (:) then moved back to regular head light position (. .). They did that two more times then disappeared. We stopped at a stop sign and confirmed we saw the same thing. Being logical people (+ being a first aid attendant and mechanic) we doubled back to see if someone went off the road or if we could have seen a reflection or something, anything to explain wtf just happened. Nothing; everything was dark and everything was how it should be. No traces of movement or light or anything. We booked it home after that. TL;DR: saw thing, got chased by lights. If anyone's interested I've got lots more weird stories to tell.   LINK"

Humanoidencounters,39gy90,Omgwhatsthatsmell,6,Thu Jun 11 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"Another one... sorry for the lack of links/quotes!   I live in northern Georgia, United States. Behind our house there is dense forest for about 60 miles. One summer I was walking along this river for a few hours that goes deeper into the woods. I was about to cross the river at a shallow part when I heard this loud whistle maybe about 40 meters to the right of where I would end up after I crossed the water. Iv'e never seen or heard any sign of anyone here before. I whistled back. After about 30 seconds I heard it again but from behind me. At this point I was confused. Then I can smell this terrible stench. It was so pungent I started gagging. I stop in the center of the river and that's when I saw it. A large, hairy, bipedal creature walking through a clearing about 15 meters from me. It look at me and it looked shocked and the hair on its shoulders stood up. It backed up quickly then turned around and sprinted. Iv'e only told my Dad about this and he told me that he had seen them before and not to tell anyone else about them. I never believed in Sasquatch or anything like that before that day. But there is no other explanation for what i saw.  I think my dad just didn't want me to scare the rest of my family by telling them. They probably wouldn't believe me anyway. My dad told me that he heard what sounded like talking in the backyard, but it sounded high pitched and gibberish. Our closest neighbors are about 2 miles away so he went out on the deck to check and saw what he describes to me as ""2 big gorillas that walked like men"". As for what I saw, I could see its face and eyes very clearly. His face looked like a human face really only more flat and with large eyes. His skin was black but his face was lighter. His fur was thin, I could see his skin through it. I could immediately tell it was male just by his face. I assume that since I heard whistling from different directions that maybe that's a way they communicate and keep track of each other? I think that because I whistled maybe he thought that I was the other Sasquatch. When he looked up at me his eyes grew wide. He studied me for maybe 2 seconds then he quickly backstepped, swiveled around and took off in a sprint. Also, I never heard him walking around and even when running away he was pretty quiet.  Edit: Also there are no bears anyone near my house. Plus, this thing was no bear in any way. Honestly I was terrified and confused by what I saw. After all I lived here for 9 years and I never saw anything like it; they weren't even supposed to be real but there it was looking straight at me. The creature was probably 7 ft tall and clearly muscular. I honestly don't think it would have harmed me but I know it easily could have if it wanted to. And it's funny because I do still go out there and its hard to explain but half of me hopes I see one again, but half of me hopes I don't. From what I hear they are rarely aggressive but I do get kind of uneasy if I hear a noise I cant identify while I'm out there."

It had legs as long as my whole body and sorta slouched but was still at least 7 or 8 feet tall. It was a dark brown in color, almost like it was made of wood. It looked like wood. As soon as I saw it I was overwhelmed with emotion and cried. It was the most involuntary cry I've ever had, and still when I think about this thing I saw, even right now, I cry. Like a knot in my through, can't fight the tears cry. It's the only time I have ever seen anything that I can't explain, or that I expect people to NOT believe me. I think about it a lot, and recently saw a facebook post from Earth is Scary and it brought back all these weird feelings about seeing this thing. I have referred to it as 'that stickman i saw' but could never find more than a few cartoons for stickmen. I don't know the point of my post but if anyone can share if they have seen something similar or heard of something....it has been haunting me for years.

Humanoidencounters,39gy90,OuttaSightVegemite,19,Fri Jun 26 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites from r/paranormal:   Sorry if this is hard to follow. I am working on some drawings that should help explain the logistics of the experience. It was the Spring of 2007. My then boyfriend and I were on our way from New York down to Miami to go to a music festival. We were driving south on the highway along the east coast of Central Florida when we pulled into a rest area so that he could catch a nap. He had been driving all day when he decided that he desperately needed a short rest before getting back behind the wheel. We had very recently bought the van and he did not think that I could handle maneuvering it, so he was doing all of the driving. (I later proved him wrong.) He parked and jumped in the back of the van and laid down on the futon mattress that we had laid there. He told me to leave him alone and he proceeded to pass out from exhaustion. I was pretty freaked out because the rest area building was unmanned, locked up and dark inside. The restrooms were closed. The small rest area building was surrounded by dark woods. There were about four other cars in the small parking lot but no sign of any drivers, so I imagine they were having an emergency lay-down as well. Normally I would never have set foot outside of the van alone in such a scenario. My instincts told me NOT to get out of the van. But I had taken some Midol for my menstrual cramps and they had given me brutal nauseau; I needed some pretzels. I mustered up all of my courage and opened the passenger-side door and squeezed through the space between our vehicle and the vehicle that was parked directly next to ours. As soon as I had a clear line of sight to the front of the rest stop building, I saw the thing, saw IT, clearly. Straight ahead I saw the brightly-lit front façade of the rest stop. To the left of the doors was IT. To the right of the doors was a vending machine. Immediately, it communicated with me. I was flooded with what I consider a telepathic message from the being: ""I cannot be seen. I cannot be seen. I must travel by night and exist in darkness. I cannot be seen. I cannot be seen. I cannot be seen."" And I felt an enormous wave of COMPASSION for the being rather that FEAR, which may seem a more logical reaction to someone hearing this story. For some reason my brain only categorized IT as one thing initially: an outsider worthy of compassion and tolerance. Its skin was pure-chalk-white. Not the skin tone “white”, the color white. It's eyes were several times larger than ours, it had two little airholes for a nose, and very thin mouth. It's frame was completely concealed by it's enormous, long, black hooded robe. It looked as though it was quite gaunt underneath, pretty frail looking. It was sitting on its bottom, knees bent, back against the brick front of the rest area, to the left of the front doors of the rest area. It was sitting with it’s back very straight, tall, and erect. It seemed in awe of me, or maybe in awe that I was actually approaching it. It looked vaguely like a human, very vaguely. It's face was snake-like. It’s eyes were right on me. I threw a little everyday smile in it’s direction and then… I did the something strange, I continued to walk toward the rest area even after seeing IT. I walked TOWARDS the rest area building, CLOSER to IT. I walked forward about 20 feet from the rear of the van to the rest areas steps, up the 20 or so steps, and to the right, where the vending machine was located. My thoughts at this point were very bizarre in retrospect: I felt bad for the thing. I didn't want it to feel different. I know that sounds hilariously quaint, if we are indeed talking about an interdimensional being, but I didn't want to run back into the van because I didn't want to hurt it's feelings. I didn't want to make it feel like a freak. It had already told me that it could not be seen due to the way people would react, so I wanted it to know that I didn't judge it for the way it looked, and that I was willing to come to terms with it’s horrific appearance in order to extend some humanity to it. (I did not know about fallen angels and such at the time.) So it was with that very bizarrely strong conviction to be righteous and humane to IT that I walked toward the vending machine. I actually got pretzels. I'm telling you, my stomach was churning. I used the vending machine with my back to it. Snyders in hand, I swiveled around to look at IT again before descending back down the steps. It was at that moment that pure terror rippled through me. I was closer to it now, approximately 15 feet away, and I could see now that there was definitely NO WAY that it was human. It was staring right at me like a wide-eyed insect. It was still in exactly the same position, except for that it had turned its head to look at me better as my position changed. It looked like an alien. It looked like a demon. IT. WAS. NOT. HUMAN. It’s huge, one-dimensional eyes…Were they totally black? I’m not sure. But I know that it did not have whites in it’s eyes. They were almond shaped, like the classic alien eye that we all know. It was then that I realized that it was EXTREMELY FUCKING TALL, unthinkably tall. Although I was standing and it was sitting, it's head still stood taller than mine. It's huge eyes were FIXED on me TOTALLY, with fascination, alarm, and with the most intense focus. Just like the way my cat looks at something right before she pounces on it. When I had made the decision to climb the stairs towards it and NOT to retreat to the van, I thought that it was sitting ON TOP of something, and that that was why its head was raised up so high. Now, from this closer perspective, I could see that it was not sitting on anything but it’s own butt. If I had realized that it was this fucking tall at the start, I very well may not have gone up the stairs. So, after the ripple of terror went through me, I responded by smiling the way you smile at a stranger when your eyes catch on the bus. I shot it a casual, thin, innocuous little ""heyhowyadoin"" smile. Why and how I acted as if things were totally fucking normal, I cannot explain. I have never acted so cool in my life. There is a Seinfeld episode when Elaine says that one of the reasons that she is a decent person is because ""when I see freaks in the street, I never ever stare at them, and yet I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."" So that's actually what was going through my head, believe it or not. If I were to guess what the thing was doing when I encountered it, judging by it's body language, I would say that it was somewhat displaced, and resting. But I have no clue, maybe it was in the middle of something far more sinister. It did NOT look like a mutant or an experiment. It looked ancient, timeless, place-less. Graceful, horrible. It was also firmly in this dimensional when I saw it. It was not a hazy vision in the slightest. The lighting was not dim. It was not even a remotely ethereal experience! The extremely bright lights that illuminated the front façade of the rest area building revealed every contour of this entity. If only I had been closer I could have provided much more detail about it’s facial features. As I was walking back to the van, I quickly strategized about how to make sure that my fear did not paralyze me and prohibit me from getting safely inside the car. I decided not to look back, or even around me as I turned the key, because if I saw that IT had moved or I saw IT coming towards me, I would have been too terrified to manage with the car keys. I got in the van. I locked the door. I screamed that we needed to leave immediately. We did. As we drove away, about 90 seconds after IT was last in my sight, I looked out the window and saw that it was gone. There was nothing where it had been. Just brick wall and concrete floor. TL;DR: I saw a GIANT, a humanoid/snake-faced being with chalk white skin wearing a black robe sitting at a rest stop in Florida in the middle of the night in 2007. It communicated with me telepathically. I am not ""crazy"" and I consider myself a very discerning person.    LINK"

As soon as I had a clear line of sight to the front of the rest stop building, I saw the thing, saw IT, clearly. Straight ahead I saw the brightly-lit front façade of the rest stop. To the left of the doors was IT.   To the right of the doors was a vending machine. Immediately, it communicated with me. I was flooded with what I consider a telepathic message from the being: ""I cannot be seen. I cannot be seen. I must travel by night and exist in darkness. I cannot be seen. I cannot be seen. I cannot be seen."" And I felt an enormous wave of COMPASSION for the being rather that FEAR, which may seem a more logical reaction to someone hearing this story. For some reason my brain only categorized IT as one thing initially: an outsider worthy of compassion and tolerance. Its skin was pure-chalk-white. Not the skin tone “white”, the color white. It's eyes were several times larger than ours, it had two little airholes for a nose, and very thin mouth. It's frame was completely concealed by it's enormous, long, black hooded robe. It looked as though it was quite gaunt underneath, pretty frail looking. It was sitting on its bottom, knees bent, back against the brick front of the rest area, to the left of the front doors of the rest area. It was sitting with it’s back very straight, tall, and erect. It seemed in awe of me, or maybe in awe that I was actually approaching it. It looked vaguely like a human, very vaguely. It's face was snake-like. It’s eyes were right on me. I threw a little everyday smile in it’s direction and then… I did the something strange, I continued to walk toward the rest area even after seeing IT. I walked TOWARDS the rest area building, CLOSER to IT. I walked forward about 20 feet from the rear of the van to the rest areas steps, up the 20 or so steps, and to the right, where the vending machine was located. My thoughts at this point were very bizarre in retrospect: I felt bad for the thing. I didn't want it to feel different.   I know that sounds hilariously quaint, if we are indeed talking about an interdimensional being, but I didn't want to run back into the van because I didn't want to hurt it's feelings. I didn't want to make it feel like a freak. It had already told me that it could not be seen due to the way people would react, so I wanted it to know that I didn't judge it for the way it looked, and that I was willing to come to terms with it’s horrific appearance in order to extend some humanity to it. (I did not know about fallen angels and such at the time.) So it was with that very bizarrely strong conviction to be righteous and humane to IT that I walked toward the vending machine. I actually got pretzels. I'm telling you, my stomach was churning. I used the vending machine with my back to it. Snyders in hand, I swiveled around to look at IT again before descending back down the steps. It was at that moment that pure terror rippled through me. I was closer to it now, approximately 15 feet away, and I could see now that there was definitely NO WAY that it was human. It was staring right at me like a wide-eyed insect. It was still in exactly the same position, except for that it had turned its head to look at me better as my position changed. It looked like an alien. It looked like a demon. IT. WAS. NOT. HUMAN. It’s huge, one-dimensional eyes…Were they totally black? I’m not sure. But I know that it did not have whites in it’s eyes. They were almond shaped, like the classic alien eye that we all know. It was then that I realized that it was EXTREMELY FUCKING TALL, unthinkably tall. Although I was standing and it was sitting, it's head still stood taller than mine. It's huge eyes were FIXED on me TOTALLY, with fascination, alarm, and with the most intense focus. Just like the way my cat looks at something right before she pounces on it.   When I had made the decision to climb the stairs towards it and NOT to retreat to the van, I thought that it was sitting ON TOP of something, and that that was why its head was raised up so high. Now, from this closer perspective, I could see that it was not sitting on anything but it’s own butt. If I had realized that it was this fucking tall at the start, I very well may not have gone up the stairs. So, after the ripple of terror went through me, I responded by smiling the way you smile at a stranger when your eyes catch on the bus. I shot it a casual, thin, innocuous little ""heyhowyadoin"" smile. Why and how I acted as if things were totally fucking normal, I cannot explain. I have never acted so cool in my life. There is a Seinfeld episode when Elaine says that one of the reasons that she is a decent person is because ""when I see freaks in the street, I never ever stare at them, and yet I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."" So that's actually what was going through my head, believe it or not. If I were to guess what the thing was doing when I encountered it, judging by it's body language, I would say that it was somewhat displaced, and resting. But I have no clue, maybe it was in the middle of something far more sinister. It did NOT look like a mutant or an experiment. It looked ancient, timeless, place-less. Graceful, horrible. It was also firmly in this dimensional when I saw it. It was not a hazy vision in the slightest. The lighting was not dim. It was not even a remotely ethereal experience! The extremely bright lights that illuminated the front façade of the rest area building revealed every contour of this entity. If only I had been closer I could have provided much more detail about it’s facial features. As I was walking back to the van, I quickly strategized about how to make sure that my fear did not paralyze me and prohibit me from getting safely inside the car. I decided not to look back, or even around me as I turned the key, because if I saw that IT had moved or I saw IT coming towards me, I would have been too terrified to manage with the car keys. I got in the van. I locked the door. I screamed that we needed to leave immediately. We did. As we drove away, about 90 seconds after IT was last in my sight, I looked out the window and saw that it was gone. There was nothing where it had been. Just brick wall and concrete floor.   TL;DR: I saw a GIANT, a humanoid/snake-faced being with chalk white skin wearing a black robe sitting at a rest stop in Florida in the middle of the night in 2007. It communicated with me telepathically. I am not ""crazy"" and I consider myself a very discerning person."
Humanoidencounters,39gy90,ZyklonDee,6,Tue Jun 16 01:12:58 2015 UTC,This is definitely one of my favorites too.  I'm so tried of all these people bumping into beings who would seem to have access to incredible information about the universe and they all run away.  If I'm ever in such a position I hope I have the foresight to sit down and talk with the creature for awhile.
Humanoidencounters,39gy90,WoolenWolf,5,Sat Jun 13 23:52:43 2015 UTC,"That is an amazingly beautiful story.  I mean, the fear is a given, lol, anyone would be shitting themselves if they saw something like that. But the fact that it communicated, asked for compassion, in a way, and didn't race away from OP or attack her or anything....I don't know. I like to think that beings like that, who just want to be left to their own devices and do no harm to anyone, live out there somewhere.  I also imagined, while reading the part where she smiled at it, it giving her a small wave or not in return. Or that ""what up"" head movement. I wonder what the alien equivalent of that is."

There was a big storm out side and rain was pouring down. It was around 3 or 4 pm and it was still pretty bright out despite the storm clouds. I was making myself a sandwich when a bolt of lightning struck the ground about half a block away from my house. The boom was loud but immediately following the boom was a human like screech that gave me shivers. I looked out the window through the rain and could see some kind of animal crawl from a yard to a jeep that was nearby. I though ""oh crap a dog must have gotten hit by that bolt!"" . I went up to the window to get a closer look and saw a big orange red furry thing crawl under the car. It looked like an orangutan. Seriously it was big and moved like an ape. I saw its arm grasping the side of the jeep as it crawled under. I took a minute to think about what I just saw and then decided to go try to get a closer look. So I went outside and slowly walked up to the jeep. When I got to the jeep I looked under and saw a glimpse of something orange disappear into a storm drain that the jeep was parked next to. I noped the fuck out of there. I still have no clue what it was. It screeched like a dieing coyote but looked like a giant orangutan. Sewer Apes!   LINK"

Humanoidencounters,39gy90,Majorturtlehead,9,Sun Jul 5 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"This one is from r/thetruthishere   I was driving alone in a national park, very far from people, on a bright full-moon night. Huge clear moon, the kind of moonlight you can read by. The road went straight along the bottom of a wide, flat, mostly barren valley, then banked up and sharply left, onto the ridge. It was about 10pm, and I drove through the valley on full alert, watching for animals and loving the scenery in the crazy bright moonlight. When I hit the curve and went into that sharp uphill left, I saw something through my side window. White thing. It was rapidly getting larger in my peripheral vision, as though it had been moving parallel to me, but the turn in the road meant I was now in its path. So I turned my head and looked directly. It was white. Man-shaped but without genitals, and naked. A deathly, nauseating white with a greasy shine, completely hairless. It was crawling, on its hands and knees, but it was half the size of the car, and it was coming so very, very fast. It had a rubbery face, distorted by hate or a scream, black eyes that reflected the moonlight. The look on its face, I can't even tell you, I can still make myself feel sick from the memory. I believed that it was intelligent, and that it wanted to tear me apart with its teeth. The speed was horrifying, it went from being a small white spot to spitting distance in the time it took to make that turn. When I unfroze myself and hit the gas, it was on the road, and I braced for it to run into my car door. And then it was gone. The rearview mirror showed me nothing. I have never told anybody. I have seen a few minor glitchy/ghosty things over my many years, but nothing has ever frightened me like that. It was looking at me. And I don't know what it was. I can't seem to find any reference to anything like it, and I would like to know if this thing is known to folklore. If another subreddit would be better to ask, just say. Thanks. EDIT: Thank you all for the replies so far. I looked into the skinwalker and wendigo ideas, and it's a case of 'almost-but-not-quite'. Are skinwalkers ever seen without skins? Then maybe. Can wendigos be stocky instead of skinny? Then maybe. I am most intrigued by the Massachusetts story. Also, while I describe it as screaming, that's just the look on its face. I heard nothing. This happened in Newfoundland. Newfoundlanders have no trouble telling ghost stories, and a lot of them believe in fairies, but I've not heard of a creature like this. As for the bear idea, Newfoundland has only black bears, hell I even tried to tell myself it was a badly lost wet polar bear, but when I say the thing was crawling, I mean I could see its legs below the knee. I was very close to it by the end, and it looked like a crawling man. I spent a lot of time in that area, and encouraged storytelling in the bar, but nothing like this ever got mentioned. But as I said, I never told this story either. The degree of fear involved somehow put it in its own category. As if it would be very, very bad luck to speak of it, because it had seen me too. I never thought I believed in them, but I think it was a demon.   LINK"
Humanoidencounters,39gy90,sniggity,6,Fri Jun 12 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"This one is from the r/askreddit thread: What is your most disturbing, scary, or creepy real story?    I was 16 and woke up in the middle of the night to seeing my clothes being rustled about in my doorway. (After washing my clothes I liked to hang dry them on my door frame.) I notice some really gray veiny looking legs and then I see these really long pointed sticks moving through my clothes. It took me a second but my sleepy eyes adjusted to see one of the most grotesque demon looking motherfuckers I have ever seen. He was extremely skinny and had a distended stomach, his skin was gray and veiny and those long sticks were his fingers. His chin was long, his eyes had no lids on them and were unusually big. His tiny mouth was in a pucker and moved like he was eating an imaginary lollipop, his hunch back looked as though it tore out of the strange hospital gown he was wearing. He just stared at me and I tried to scream my grandmother awake who was sharing a room with me for the weekend. He wouldn't stop staring, and I stared back and tried to shake my Grandmother awake. I started noticing other things about him like how large and cone like his head was and how hairless and shriveled he look as he stood still, surprised I could see him. My Grandmother woke up looked towards the door and he was gone. In the weeks leading to this encounter I had been experiencing strange things in my house like my bedroom door slamming and locking on it's own. One night I woke up to what felt like several hands touching my feet and legs and horrible nightmares. After the experience with this strange gray man I told my parents and they had my room exorcized. Idk if an exorcism really made those horrible things stop or gave me peace of mind from things I was manifesting myself. All I know is I don't experience those things anymore and I'll never sleep with a door open again. Tl; dr: I saw a demon who was surprised I could see him and had to exorcise my room. Not sure if real or I manifested it in my stressed out teenage brain.   LINK"
Humanoidencounters,39gy90,OuttaSightVegemite,5,Tue Jun 23 19:15:17 2015 UTC,"Here's another one from the r/askreddit thread: What is your most disturbing, scary, or creepy real story?   Let me first say I have only told this to 3 people in my life for fear of me being crazy. Almost 5 yeARs ago I was fishing at my grandma pasture ( she ones several hundred acres in the south central Kansas area). Where I was fishing there is a small dam and waterfall in a fairly wooded area. It was just getting dark I had walked the creek and my vehicle was a good mile away. I was almost finished when I hooked a decent bass I brought it in and as I was throwing him back when something caught my eye across the creek stood a creature. It stood only 4 ft tall at the max it was grey pale almost looked sickly. The best way I can describe it was like a hairless cat head and skin but like a skinny yet impressive human like body. The creature was look directly at me like I fucked up and I shouldn't be seeing him. His head rocked side to side almost like it was dancing. I slowly reached for my filet knife making sure not to take my eyes of it. I did feel threatened by what ever this was. I get my knife in hand and it lets out a sound that I have never heard before and hope to never hear again it was loud and extremely high pitched and took off into the wood. I have never seen that again but other have told me about lights they see down there but I didn't share my story for fear of ridicule. I now carry a gun with me when I fish. Thanks for reading I know 90 percent of ppl won't believe this but I know what I saw and it scared the shit out of me   LINK"
Humanoidencounters,39gy90,Frightened_Peasant,4,Tue Jun 23 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"Here's one from the r/askreddit thread: Has there ever been a time that you truly believe you've encountered something paranormal?   Apologies, this is a long one. One night me and two friends were all walking around at night in the fields around a small town in Michigan. Our destination was a junkyard tucked away behind several fields, home to rusted out cars, semi trailers, farm equipment etc. We were cutting through the fields to avoid the trigger happy farmers that live around there. Just about there, and we were foiled by a stream too wide to leap. It was late autumn, and wet feet would be uncomfortable, so we backtracked into the adjacent field. From our corner of the field, there was a treeline that ran east-west, and southward the land rose into a large hill. We stood for a moment, discussing our options, when my eyes were drawn to a large white boulder, seeming to glow a bit in the moonlight. It was around 75 yards away, and I was idly staring at it when it moved. It unfolded, standing up- a 10-12 foot bipedal being, skeletal-thin, pure white, with long limbs. For the space of a second, it looked at us, and then it took off. I think it was running, but it may have been gliding or flying, honestly unsure. It crossed the field, up over the hill, a distance of probably 100 yards, in 2-3 seconds, in complete silence, and was gone. Only two of the three of us saw it, and after a few minutes of incoherent gibbering, we tried to rationalize, explain, figure out what the hell we saw, and we decided it must be an alien. A year later, I was at a party and the subject of aliens came up. I say, ""Ive seen an alien!"" And they say, ""Yeah let me guess, in Saranac, right?"" I confirm, we exchange mutual looks of awe, and he directs me to this Eric fellow who grew up in said town. Eric tells me that he has seen strange things there his whole life- lights in the sky, etc, but no humanoid beings. Fast-forward another year and a half or so, and I get a phone call from an acquaintance, who was sitting at work when he noticed a girl staring at him strangely. She eventually walks up to him and says ""I feel like I need to talk to you."" She proceeds to tell him that her friend's dad is the head of a vampire clan in a town near Saranac. My friend remembers my story about weird things in that area and asks her if she knows anything about Saranac. She gets very defensive, and eventually reveals that ""Saranac is a breeding ground for dragons."" Yeah. To this day I'm not certain if I saw a dragon, an alien, or a vampire, but I did a bit of poking around, and I heard from a girl that lived there as a kid that she had seen random 15 foot scorch marks on roadsides and in the middle of fields. Also, I found this story- http://paranormal.about.com/library/blstory_december07_21.htm Any illumination or similar tales are appreciated!   LINK"

Humanoidencounters,39gy90,OuttaSightVegemite,5,Sat Jul 11 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"I have a few for the collection! Unfortunately I have not cataloged the users/thread/links and so I feel a but guilty posting these, but here goes:   This is related to a weird cryptic story. There have been tales of a strange creature with red eyes. Not like the kind you see in a photo, but actually red eyes, usually very large. It’s a rare sighting, but several stories have mentioned it. This is one of those stories.  I’m hunging coyotes out in some cornfields. In front of me there’s a jacklighted deer with a gutpile . I shoot 2 coyotes, but leave them there. Half hour passes, then suddenly there is total silence. No bugs, no birds, nothing. I hear a strange crunch-scrape, crunch, and then a tearing noise. Some clouds pass, and it gets very dark for a moment, then the moon shines again and I see something silver, very low to the ground, about 8 feet long, knowing on a dead coyote by the gutpile. I assumed it was a pair of coyotes, laid down to dine, and that explains the length. Night vision sucks for distance recognition, but I bring the rifle to shoulder, I sight approximately where a shoulder/hip would be. I’m using .243 ballistic tips, which is more than enough for a coyote, even with a hip shot. I fire the gun. This creature just kinda, stands up? It only gains about 6 inches in height, but now I can clearly see it has only 4 legs. It turns towards me and oh my god, the eyes. Blood fucking red? And huge?!? Like, bigger than a coyote’s entire head, huge! I work the bolt on the gun and fire again. I see a round impact in a puf of dust and hair, 3 inches behind/beside one of the eyes. It just kinda saunters off, like I’d hit it with a cork gun? I fire again, work the bolt, and fire again! I reload, and retreat carefully back to my truck. I grab the AR I have there and a few mags, along with a spotlight. I get back to my position and shine the spotlight. I see blood and fur everywhere! The fur is red, like fake redhead color, like I’d shot a pipe full of cheap wigs. I notice blood trail, but it looks black? I’m freaked out because that’s night right, especially with incandescent light. I shine up to the woodline and I immediately see the face/eyes of that thing. It’s just sitting there, watching, but sitting like a dog. It looks about 6 feet tall? But I know its legs were rather short, and I take a better look and can see that it’s front legs are leaning on an old fence post, like a human, and it’s covered in that weird red fur! I shot at it with the AR, and just unloaded a mag. I fired the whole mag. I reloaded and shine back at the creature, but it’s just standing there, now it has some kind of black blood dripping down its fur, but it doesn’t look concerned. I decided this was a bad idea, and tactically run back to the truck. I drove out of there, get back into town, and find the game warden in the morning. We go out there at first light, armed for a bear. Coyotes and deer are now picked clean. Way too clean, and not like any predator I’ve seen. We find the blood and the fur and the game warden take samples. I go  home, and as soon as I get home I get a call from DNR that says it was a bobcat. I’m pretty certain I got home before the game warden got back to his part of town, and there’s no way an analysis could be done that quickly. My state hasn’t had a bobcat sighting in a few decades. I call DNR back but they tell me to drop the issue. That thing was huge, at took hits from 2, .243 shot, and at least one good hit from a 5.56! I never went back to the farm after dark. I don’t know what it was, but maybe the government was testing some kind of sentient bioweapon or something? I have no idea?"

Someone almost always has one weird thing that has happened to them. So reddit, regardless of whatever you belief about the world, do you have a story as such?   This will get buried, but it feels good to talk about it every once in a while. I should begin by saying I'm a painfully rational creature and nothing even remotely like this has happened to me before or since. At the time this occurred, about three years ago, my dad's place was located very near my work, so I would travel down this particular stretch of road pretty much every day. It was a well-lit road leading into the downtown area of a small city, and the river lay on my right (going to my dad's house, this particular evening), wending along, dotted by some rather nice properties. I had been driving along, actually singing along to an old song on the radio. I was in fine spirits, going to see my dad, and while the road wasn't deserted there were few cars along it at the time. All of a sudden, stopping me cold, I felt this wave of emotions crash over me, fear and grief and a desire to scream slamming into me like a physical car crash. Time seemed to slow for a moment, the way it does during a surge of adrenaline, and I saw not three feet from my right wheel well something tall, impossibly thin and absolutely dark. But it moved. It turned, and I caught just the slightest glimpse of something, a face. I could make out what looked like a beak, short and bent, protruding from beneath a hood. And a word, for a millisecond one word rang in my head loudly, more like a title than a feeling. ""Dread."" I continued to watch, time still stretched thin, as I passed it, my passenger-side mirror coming dangerously close. And as I turned to get a better glance, it was gone. The street lamps hadn't altered once, had shone right where I saw it. I ran the details over and over in my mind, actually turned the car around to examine the spot. My heart was pounding, and I had to turn off the radio. I was covered in goosepimples. But there was nothing there, no tree or post or any other viable explanation, to account for what I saw. It felt as real as anything I've ever felt. It felt as though, for a brief, brief moment, another consciousness touched mine to make its presence known. And it felt old.   LINK"

What bugs me is their color and glowy-ness seems to match that of the lights on the ground.    We also need to keep in mind that a person's profession can't always guarantee the truthfulness of their statements.  Remember the famous ""surgeon's photograph"" of the Loch Ness Monster.  The ""surgeon"" was a (supposedly) well respected gynecologist.  But he also supposedly loved a good joke."
Humanoidencounters,39cr0y,SpastixFantastix,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:51:07 2015 UTC,"Section 11. ""Surgeon's Photograph"" (1934) of article  Loch Ness Monster:       The ""Surgeon's Photograph"" (pictured above) is purported to be the first photo of a ""head and neck"",  and is one of the most iconic Nessie photos. Supposedly taken by Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist, it was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934.  Wilson's refusal to have his name associated with the photograph led to it being nicknamed the ""Surgeon's Photograph"".  He claimed that he was looking at the loch when he saw the monster, so he grabbed his camera and snapped four photos. Only two exposures came out clear: the first one shows what was claimed to be a small head and back, while the second one shows a similar head in a diving position. The first one became iconic, while the second attracted little publicity because it was difficult to interpret what was depicted, due to its blurry quality.

Humanoidencounters,39buqu,sniggity,5,Wed Jun 10 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, /u/sniggity.  I think I've been around since the beginning but change is good too.  I hope more people will find this sub so we can get more ""personal"" experiences.  Though you do manage to find some interesting stuff.    So anyway, can we have flairs?  Even if it's just ""write your own flair"" type flair...I just enjoy coming up with ridiculous things to put as my flair.  I dunno.    Also maybe some tags?  Like for personal encounters (what the posting person saw) versus posts where the original source is not available, and also for posts with pictures or video (though you are always good about marking those) and maybe discussion and meta and whatnot.    If you need help, let me know.  I know absolutely nothing about subreddit making but my google-fu is decent and I would love to see this place grow.  Cheers!"
Humanoidencounters,39buqu,SpastixFantastix,3,Thu Jun 11 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I have to read up on my CSS so I can learn how to add Flair.  Really great suggestions.  I also want to add a tag for bedroom encounters, because I don't post them because it could very easily be sleep paralysis or a dream.  But the thing is, there are tons of interesting bedroom encounters that could be posted.  So yeah, great ideas, buddy ! I'll be in touch with you shortly."
Humanoidencounters,39buqu,SpastixFantastix,4,Thu Jun 11 03:02:55 2015 UTC,"Female buddy, just FYI ;)  Bedroom encounters would be cool, obviously with the caveat that it's understood the possible explanations.  Even if they're dreams or sleep paralysis, they're fascinating.  Especially when you take into account the number of people who experience the ""old hag"" during sleep paralysis (the female witch/demon/whatever).  I mean a bunch of stranger all dreaming the same thing?  And I didn't even know about sleep paralysis when I had my hag experience."
Humanoidencounters,39buqu,SpastixFantastix,2,Thu Jun 11 03:38:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, see, I'd love to have more hag stories, but they do fall into the ghost/demonic realm as opposed to the humanoid genre.  But like you say, as long as it's understood with a [bedroom] tag or something.  And thank you for clarifying the ""buddy"" thing, I wasn't quite sure.  I usually call people ""man"" or ""bro"" but something told me to stick with ""buddy"" haha. I think everything is going to turn out pretty cool.  I don't think we need too many bedroom posts, just the occasional.  But we do need tags for other posts.  Like you said, we need a [self] tag for people who want to share, as opposed to me bombarding the board every other day haha !"

My kids are after me to""get with it"".  Anyway my daughter works at Walmart. Her first job ever. She's been there two years now while she goes to school. One night she called home hysterical. She had seen two black eyed men walking down the isle. She knew what they were because of me. I'm really into the paranormal and read her some stories from Reddit and other sites of true stories. The thing is they seemed to notice that she noticed them from a little distance. They mad an abrupt turn and came right up to her. One moved to directly behind her and the other right in front. She booked back to her station and they followed.  She then went to the back and called us. She was so upset that they told her she could go home and her father went and got her. She wasn't able to drive herself. Since then she has seen other strange ""people"". I personally think they hang at Walmart to observe people at the low end of the spectrum so to speak. You can find the worse of humanity there, believe me.   Well I thought you might be interested. I could probably get  her to talk to you herself if you wanted. Thank you for your time."

Btw, has she ever seen these beings or any others like it since then?  I know you say she has seen other strange ""people"", but how about these exact beings?  I'd also like to hear about what/who else she has had encounters with after this episode.  Thanks so much for contacting me, I hope we can get something lined up !"

They're just interesting. If you're mind tells you is real will be real to you.   Edit: Copy pasta from a comment below to the fellow who said I need science and to OP who felt like my comment didn't realte at all:   A little judgmental for /r/Humanoidencounters . I brought up being a Buddhist because it tied into /u/sniggity 's comment:   even just ONE of these encounters are real   And I really thought about what he meant by being real. Do we expect a reptilian or bigfoot to be caught any time soon? Probably not. If someone produces genuine footage of a UFO sighting, does that make aliens real? If someone is abducted by aliens are they crazy or telling the truth? Where do we draw the line? I honestly think if you boil it down; individual reality doesn't quite come from popular belief and popular belief doesn't quite tie into individual reality. Our brains, or minds, our experiences generates these strange humanoid experiences. Even if OP did have a legitimate humanoid experience, does that make us all believers? Probably not, we weren't there to experience the encounter and vice versa.  I grew up to my mother leaving the radio on at night. Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM would come on and I'd listen to the fascinating stories every night. I'd CRAVE to know whether these things are real or not. I've realized you'll never get an answer. The craving to know will ultimately be a waste of time, especially trying to prove it to the masses.  The reason I brought up being a Buddhist isn't because it was completely unrelated to the conversation or it's a replacement for science. I brought it up because my view on reality is heavily influenced by Eastern Philosophy and I wanted to offer an opinion to see if we could generate a serious discussion on whether or not these things really are real.

Humanoidencounters,395rzm,sniggity,-2,Tue Jun 9 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"It does because it ties into reality. The world looks a lot different through other beings eyes. Just because we sense a certain way doesn't mean that's how things ultimately are.  It's all subjective. That's why ""reality"" doesn't hold a lot of relevance in the universe whereas perception does. Thus, reality is irrelevant.  To boil this down even more, I'm more interested in your experience than deducing if it actually happened if that makes sense."

It's hard to make out what's up with the zoomed-in pictures, so who knows.  However:   This doesn't seem to be a direct close encounter, like many of the experiences recounted in this subreddit. He felt like he was being watched. My opinion is that in some cases, this is actually indicative that something's up. Maybe something weird. However, it's easy for that ""being watched"" feeling to ""misfire"" for any of a variety of reasons. It's largely unconscious, so one might not be directly aware of what triggered it. Basically, I'm not 100% convinced that his sensation of a presence was indicative of a paranormal presence. The pictures aren't clear at all. This isn't the photographer's fault. The object in question was way off in the difference, and there's just not enough detail to really see what's there. It could be something truly strange... but it could also be a plastic bag, as another commenter suggested. We can probably never know for sure, but overall, something mundane is probably more likely.   Sorry to be a killjoy here. I'm very interested in all things paranormal, and I really believe there are many things that people experience that we do not yet understand. However, I'm very skeptical toward these particular photos."

Though you're not convinced, at least you still took the time to look at, enjoy, and analyze the pics !  To be honest with you, I can't or won't say for certain either whether this was a true humanoid encounter.  Granted, there is something definitely in the pics, but there are factors here that cannot be ruled out.  You have hoaxing, misidentification, pareidolia and plain old ""trash blowing in the wind"".

Humanoidencounters,384s19,D_Row,3,Mon Jun 1 23:10:42 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Humanoidencounters,384qgs,sniggity,5,Mon Jun 1 21:05:22 2015 UTC,Interesting this isn't the first story you've posted that happened in a night  club. One was in South America I believe.
Humanoidencounters,384qgs,RealGsDontSleep,3,Mon Jun 8 06:51:45 2015 UTC,"I think they genuinely are interested in how we socialize, interact with each other and even our mating rituals.  Because let's face it, a lot of people go to the club to find some love.... Lol"
Humanoidencounters,384qgs,RealGsDontSleep,2,Mon Jun 8 17:58:05 2015 UTC,I agree completely. There are always ufo sightings at concerts. My friend saw one at a festival recently lol.
Humanoidencounters,384snk,sniggity,4,Mon Jun 1 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"This is what so many people have discussed, that bigfoot are actually spies for otherworldly species who are set to live on the fringes of society while keeping tabs on us. They make a perfect creature for this because 1) no one seems to be able to catch or photograph them 2) they are physically imposing and no sane human would risk a fight with one and 3) there are numerous reports of bigfoot sightings and ufos been seen with them or vice versa!  The context of the conversation with this individual is amazing. He is given a choice for free will, to go and see other worlds (although he might not survive the journey, not all beings can travel at zero-g or time warp drive). And the warning about the nuclear war is very chilling. I have read other reports about aliens visiting nuclear sites and turning off nuclear warheads and ballistic missles. Maybe they do have our best interest at heart at first, but how many warnings do we get?"
Humanoidencounters,37mad7,sniggity,3,Thu May 28 17:41:51 2015 UTC,I'm wondering now if most alien visitations are in fact inter dimensional beings. Like other versions of us (think Sliders) that figures it out a while back and go around checking out the other dimensions.
Humanoidencounters,37mad7,chewieconcarne,1 point,Fri May 29 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's an exciting thought, and I certainly don't have a better explanation. I just wonder why an interdimentional being would choose to hang out in a suburban backyard."
Humanoidencounters,37mad7,abbie_yoyo,2,Fri May 29 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"Who knows. Maybe their world is drastically different? Instead of green, plants maybe are purple mostly or maybe their worlds are now barren."
Humanoidencounters,37mad7,chewieconcarne,2,Fri May 29 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yup, it could have been doing something as mundane as checking out a flowerbed or something.  They may have never seen a flower where it's from."
Humanoidencounters,37mb1m,sniggity,3,Thu May 28 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that is scary as hell! What makes it even scarier, is two or three people were conscious while this event was unfolding. The fact that it could have turned violent and the aliens didn't kill anyone is amazing. I really think that they could have done something bad if they wanted to. Weapons don't always solve problems. As for the hand coming in the tent, the guy could have yelled and woke everyone up. That would be preferable to getting everyone killed by laser photon guns that turn you to dust... Pew pew...zaaaap"

I hope you don't mind all the questions, I'm just really curious as to what you saw?  Could you sketch it at all or maybe find something similar online?  What DO YOU think it was?"
Humanoidencounters,37gvi7,BarbarianSasquatch,5,Wed May 27 18:39:13 2015 UTC,I drew this sketch a couple months ago. I'm horrible at capturing what thing looked like but this was the best I could do: http://imgur.com/4I7Ow3x
Humanoidencounters,37gvi7,BarbarianSasquatch,1 point,Wed May 27 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"Your sketch here is incredibly reminiscent of descriptions from reported ET encounters. It seems like your Papa knew something that he didn't tell you guys when he saw the tracks and sold the cabin. Do you remember him talking about any strange events in his life? It is supposed that people with Native American blood are on the ""high likelihood"" side of abduction spectrum, which means your Papa, father, uncles, cousins, and even yourself could have experienced even more strange occurrences in your life that you may not be fully aware of currently."
Humanoidencounters,37gvi7,sniggity,1 point,Thu May 28 13:02:41 2015 UTC,"He used to be in the woods for over 40 years as a tracker and working with the DNR.  We would always ask him stories about if he had seen anything like bigfoot.  He would always say no but that he has seen things that make you think, but never went into detail.  On that day though he knew exactly what those footprints were."
Humanoidencounters,37gvi7,cashan0va_007,1 point,Thu May 28 14:32:29 2015 UTC,"Did he ever talk to anyone in your family? I feel that if you were to poke around and ask your family, maybe your Papa shared his stories with someone. People who ""see things that make you think,"" usually tend to write it down or talk to at least one person about it to keep it from driving them up a wall."
Humanoidencounters,37gvi7,sniggity,4,Thu May 28 14:43:23 2015 UTC,"It's color was this off shoot of grayish brown. Here's my best visualization of it: It ran in a bizarre sideways motion but was very quick. It's body also didn't bob at all. It maintained the same line as it ran and it's appendages were long and it was well muscled. It had hair and a normal sized head but it's eyes were just massive. They didn't glow at all as it wasn't that dark yet but I did see that before dark glimmer animal eyes get. The eyes seemed human but just so damn big. The noise it made reminded me of a pissed off girl going ""GRRRRRR"" but it was just vile and powerfully loud/ higher pitched with a guttural tone. It held eye contact with us right until it went off into the woods."
Humanoidencounters,37gvi7,autowikibot,5,Wed May 27 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, sounds like some sort of weird ""grey"" alien.  Maybe it was on a scouting mission and you guys caught it off guard.  What I would do, (I'll even do it for you) is go to www.ufocenter.com and do a search for the date and time (Approx) when you saw it and see if anybody saw any UFOs in the sera at the time.  Give or take a few days, there may be something to find !   Thanks so much for this encounter, it's awesome.  Life changing for you, too !"
Humanoidencounters,37gvi7,anonymous_being,5,Wed May 27 22:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think this was a sasquatch. It could have been a hybrid gray with large eyes and maybe have insect like appendages, they also move very fast in a way that is non human . Also, the group of four fishermen that were abducted from their camping trip said they saw praying mantis like beings with large eyes, and that's what his drawing looks like to me..."

You should read that book, man !  It was a wild encounter.  One of the twins said when the beings beamed them up into their ship, he said he could feel his body being taken apart at a molecular level, but at the whole time he could see himself !

Your mind is struggling to comprehend the entity but it ends up having an actual adverse reaction to your psychological state. There's a book called Blit by David Langford; that is a creative and very unique story of something incomprehensible. It's actually a series, even a segment where humanity has succumbed to the basilisks, and earth is in a post apocalyptic world.  Crazy scary encounter too, very well described and written.

What I don't get is why they aren't around more? Why do they not really seem to do anything except scare the shit out of people.  Half of the accounts that I read online, I don't believe. I don't think that they are all going to people's doors as children and begging to get in. I think that that's a story that people took and ran with.

Those little white drones- you say that they are the size of a penny or coin. What are the chances of those drones ever going into someone's house. The reason I ask is this:  I have had bizarre paranormal encounters for most of life. They really ramped up when I was in my mid twenties. The way that it started was so weird!  I was sitting on my bed one day, talking to my boyfriend. I felt something on my head. It rolled (or felt like it was rolling) slowly down to my forehead.  I put my hand up to my forehead to see what it was (I was certain it was a bug, and terrified that it might be a spider!).   As soon as I reached up to touch it, it took off flying! It was not a bug, though. It was a white, pill shaped thing! It was dull white. Seriously- it looked like a tylenol pill!   It flew a few feet in front of me and then disappeared! My boyfriend was right beside me and did not see it.  A day or so later, I was getting out of the shower, just drying off, and the same, or a similar thing flew past me again! It too disappeared.  Both times I saw this thing, it was day time. I was not on any drugs, or drunk, or tired.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen. I have never been able to find anyone else who has encountered anything similar (well, except for your mention of these white drones).  As soon as I had these two encounters, something inside me changed. Before this, I had no interest in the paranormal (despite having some odd encounters when I was younger-some of them are here on this sub-reddit). After I saw these 'flying pills', I became obsessed with all things paranormal. Also, I started having more encounters-mainly with ghosts, but also some night time encounters with beings-usually I was in a sleep state of some sort.  When I read your account , I was interested, blown away, etc. As soon as I read about the drones, my stomach dropped and I got tears in my eyes.  I could be totally wrong- they could be two completely different things-your drones/my pills.  But I don't know-it just seems to ring true for me.  What else could those pills have been? And why would seeing them seem to set off some sort change in me?  When I saw those pills, some part of me thought 'ok, it's time to get moving and serious now...'"

Humanoidencounters,35o9e3,sniggity,8,Tue May 12 04:04:54 2015 UTC,The thing I never understand about stories like this is.. Wouldn't the first thing you do be take photographs of all of the handprints everywhere? Who finds hundreds of small handprints like wet paint all over their house and doesn't take pictures ?
Humanoidencounters,35o9e3,Bizrat7,3,Tue May 12 05:41:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel you on that. I would love more documentation with a lot of these stories.  Maybe I'll try and find out if the person took pics.  I know I'd be taking pics, samples, bagging shit up...haha"
Humanoidencounters,35o9e3,Nevek_Green,2,Tue May 12 05:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think most people just want this to go away. They may recount it, but they don't want attention from it or they just don't think to document it. We're interested in the subject after marveling we would probably think to document it."

Humanoidencounters,35h02r,twotwirlygirlys,3,Sun May 10 16:32:01 2015 UTC,Is the aura usually 3-4 times larger than the physical body?
Humanoidencounters,35h02r,twotwirlygirlys,3,Sun May 10 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"Possibly the aura is a ""grown-up""? I have heard that we are all age 33 in heaven. Maybe the physical form's size does not matter. I have never thought that the soul or the aura had to fit in a particular physical form.  edit: Meaning that is a thought provoking question that I have never considered before."
Humanoidencounters,35h02r,____dim____,2,Sun May 10 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"I remember a very interesting interview on Coast to Coast about angels. I couldn't find the episode because I can't remember the date I heard it, but the interviewed person, a very eloquent man, described angels as looking like little rainbows. Maybe 1 foot wide.

Humanoidencounters,35h02r,sniggity,3,Tue May 12 00:23:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this, it's really an awesome encounter !  This being had to have been some sort of multidimensional intelligence.  It sounds like it was beautiful whatever it was."
Humanoidencounters,35h02r,ASK47,3,Sun May 10 15:24:38 2015 UTC,We're all multidimensionally intelligent. It takes at least three dimensions to be able to think at all!
Humanoidencounters,35h02r,sniggity,2,Sun May 10 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I meant ""multi"" as in ""this dimension"" and ""another dimension"" the being can traverse. :)"
Humanoidencounters,35h02r,ASK47,0,Mon May 11 02:23:44 2015 UTC,"oh you mean an alternate universe? Dimensions aren't something traversable, or something you can ""exist in"" - they are types of measurement units. Like, my dimensions are 6 feet tall, three feet wide, and half a foot deep, and it took me six minutes to type this reply. I'm not living ""in"" the third or fourth dimensions. All those dimensions are simply used to describe physical things existing in one universe.  People say ""another dimension"" all the time, like in the Beastie Boys song, or the Twilight Zone, but don't realize it literally has no practical meaning. If it's another place, and it's not in our universe - it's another universe. Which, presumes a multiverse or omniverse, I suppose.  There's also the concept of Flatland that is used to illustrate our three spatial dimensions. Unfortunately, it assumes certain things that are quite impossible - such as two dimensional beings that can somehow think, but can't conceive of the third dimension. In fact their entire field of vision would be an invisible line - how could awareness manifest on such a (literal) plane? Obviously that's not a feasible existence as we know it."
Humanoidencounters,35h02r,sniggity,1 point,Mon May 11 14:37:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, I mean another universe.  But you get what I was saying, even though I had the wrong nomenclature. :)"

Humanoidencounters,35figc,Ghyllie,2,Sun May 10 05:13:56 2015 UTC,"That's a bear.  It is just so decomposed that the musculature is difficult to picture and the hair is gone from much of the hindquarters, either from decomposition or, possibly, mange while the animal was alive.  Look at the paws, though.  That's a bear."
Humanoidencounters,35figc,coquihalla,1 point,Sun May 10 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. My father was a hunter, and when I was a kid he brought him a bear, skinned it and hung it in his shop. Skinned, they have an incredibly human look to them,  which may add to some of the confusion."

Humanoidencounters,35308v,BareKnuckleKitty,2,Thu May 7 00:26:07 2015 UTC,I think you're right about that.  Lol
Humanoidencounters,35308v,fionaharris,2,Thu May 7 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"I get how we should absolutely never attack an alien. I am totally with you on that. But that statement ""I want one of there ugly grey heads mounted about my fireplace""  It came so far out of left field that I laughed when I read it!

Humanoidencounters,34wyw7,sniggity,7,Tue May 5 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this reminds me of when my parents took me to a cavern tour when I was young. It went very, very deep Into the earth. I guess Indians used to hide there for days at a time in pitch black. There is something very, very unnatural about being that deep in the earth. Some people even recall hearing mechanical sounds when they got very close to the bottom. The staff had access 24 hours a day and would go down to the bottom in their off-time to see who could stay the longest without getting freaked out. Apparently, one guy who stayed down there for a few hours reported hearing a mechanical whirr and scraping, and when he shouted it became quiet. There are lots of stories of underground civililzations in the world.."
Humanoidencounters,34wyw7,cashan0va_007,3,Tue May 5 08:00:51 2015 UTC,"We went into the Linville caverns in NC as a child. We went as deep as we could and it was a very tight space. Towards the end of the tour (in the deepest parts) they would section off some areas because they said they were not to take tourists in there sometimes. I wondered why just ""sometimes"". I was only about 10 so this is twenty years ago. I still remember how strange it was. We were also at the front of the line so the deepest in the crack where they had grates built into the rock to walk on. The line of folks pushed in on us because we could go no further with the innermost sectioned off. That was a bit scary. The tour guide had no idea we weren't allowed further in that day and this makes me wonder if it was ""loud"" that day in the mountain. I don't know if my descriptions are making sense, but just know it made enough impression on a 10 year old girl to remember it nearly 1/4 century later. Even my Dad was a bit freaked out and ready to get out of there.  Dad experienced a lot of paranormal occurrences throughout his life though so he probably knew about this underground civilization theory."

Look at how debilitating social anxiety can be, and that's comes from being around other humans.  Now magnify that by a thousand and I think that's what we get with an encounter like this one.  I feel sorry for folks who go through this stuff.  I saw a wolfman creature from a moving vehicle and it affected me tremendously.

Very tall black things (people would call them shadow creatures- I have always seen them as 'ghosts'). They are about 7 feet tall, and black- almost like this black smoke.Sometimes they are just a tall human like shape, and other times, they look like the Grim Reaper. My 10 year old son has seen them, too- we call them the Grim Reaper ghosts. They never feel scary or evil though- but they do feel as if they were never human-so they don't seem to be the ghosts of dead people. We've seen them at the last 3 places we have lived.   Imagine if they were the same creatures? If they were aliens? We have never experienced missing time, or strange marks on our bodies. It has always felt as if they were just there, checking us out.

Humanoidencounters,33dnxz,sniggity,8,Tue Apr 21 18:00:03 2015 UTC,That area of West Virginia was cursed by the native tribe who were slaughtered there by the first European settlers. There is a name of the native elder who cursed it... Ever since there have been demonic entities that show themselves at certain times... And foretell mass casualty events like the mothman did...this could be a demonic skinwalker or it could be a regular dogman (even though I though dogman was more in the mid-west)

Humanoidencounters,33dlii,ASK47,3,Tue Apr 21 23:46:09 2015 UTC,Why isn't there reason? There is just as much reason to suspect that they may have been abducted as there is to suspect that nothing at all happened to them.

The hair was curly though, and kind of the colour of a golden lab- maybe a little darker.  http://kawiku.deviantart.com/art/Cousin-Itt-312499888  The creature was about 2 1/2 feet tall.   The one on the chair was about the same colour- maybe a little lighter, and it was the size of a small cat. Now that I think about it, it was maybe a smaller version of the one in the bedroom.  The sound that it made was loud. I tried dropping a heavy book on the chair to make the same sound and it didn't work. I dropped the book on my living room rug and it still wasn't loud enough- dropping it on the kitchen floor was more of how it sounded."
Humanoidencounters,333j8m,sniggity,0,Sun Apr 19 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's amazing. Scary I'm sure, but I wondered what those little things could've been? That home had to have been located on top of some a sort of vortex."
Humanoidencounters,333j8m,sniggity,2,Mon Apr 20 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"Wherever I live has a vortex! But yeah, that basement suite had some messed up stuff going on in it.   One evening, I was sitting in my room, reading (ok..ok.. I was on my lap top..) and I watched a black shadowy figure float out of my sons room, past my open bedroom door and down the hall. It's head was nearly touching the ceiling (which in my basement suite, was pretty low, but still taller than the average man). I checked to see where my sons were. One was in the living room watching TV, and my youngest son came barrelling out of the bathroom yelling, because when he went to wash his hands, he saw a woman behind him in the mirror!   So it looked to me as if the shadowy figure went past my room and into the bathroom, and half a second after, I want past the bathroom thinking that it was going down the hall, but actually it went through the bathroom door and scared my poor kid out of his wits!  (I was sure that the shadowy figure was male, but I guess I was wrong).  Also, not every time, but often, I would turn out my living room lights, and I could see a tall, dark figure that looked like a woman, holding hands or standing beside a tiny figure that looked like a little girl.  I had a guy over once, and he was very logical. I had told him that I was seeing stuff, but didn't go into much detail, since we had only been a few dates.   We came by to pick something up one evening, and as I turned off the living room lights, he happened to look (I had long ago made it habit NOT to look!) back and he saw the figure, and it was soooo funny. He stopped dead in his tracks, and in this weird neutral voice said 'OK. I just saw a woman and a child ghost. Is that what I saw?"" and I told him yes, and he walked out and was so stiff and silent. I laughed to myself, because I could see his logical mind just turning and turning, trying to make sense of it. He would NEVER come over after that. It scared the crap out of him!!  I also had an ice bed! Even in summer, my bed was icy cold. I'd get friends to put pull down the sheets and put their hands in it. I had fleecy blankets on the mattress, and layers and layers of blankets,and it was always cold, even in the middle of summer. I wore pajamas, wool socks, a long sleeved t-shirt and a cardigan to bed every single night that I lived in that place, and yeah, I know that it was a basement suite and my bed and box spring were on the ground, but the room wasn't that cold, and my kids had mattresses on the floor the first winter that we lived there and their room and beds were so warm! Even when my room was warm (which was rare), the bed was ICE.  I have other things that went on there, but this is already really long."

Don't like the way the interviewer casts doubt and inflected the same tone an abusive dad used to? You fail. Stressed out because of home life, and not even stressed about the test? You'll still fail.  Liars. Especially good liars. Don't care, and in fact, lack the brain chemistry to feel bad, guilt, or stress when lying and can and do pass lie detector tests.

I mean... if they try to run, I wonder if the weight of their head causes them to tip over like an awkward toddler?  Not saying they aren't hybrids. I believe anything's possible.  And what about those accounts of MIBs looking like they're wearing a human suit? Like their skin is too tightly stretched around the face, or too loose. Gah, it's all so fascinating!"
Humanoidencounters,31dzdi,zakradd,3,Mon Apr 20 01:43:55 2015 UTC,"Ha, all I have are assumptions, like the rest of us I guess.  I think they are making hybrids so they can repopulate another earth type planet.  Also, it comes in handy to have hybrids because they kinda blend in with people and at first glance most people wouldn't think anything of it, that way they can do their MIB investigating without too much suspicion. I mean, why else is he wearing sunglasses at night lol? To cover up them big ass eyes.  He may have been there to intimidate the old lady as well.  Maybe that's when she's home alone.  Maybe he didn't think she was there and was trying to get in to steal her camera?!?!  They have been known to take photos of UFOs from people in the past.  But again, your guess is as good as mine.

Humanoidencounters,308yho,ElevenEleven-time,5,Wed Mar 25 13:13:54 2015 UTC,You had snack time in middle school?
Humanoidencounters,308yho,abbie_yoyo,2,Wed Mar 25 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because a few kids had dietary requirements, i.e. low blood sugar so we all were allowed to have it."
Humanoidencounters,308yho,abbie_yoyo,3,Wed Mar 25 16:01:30 2015 UTC,You ever look her up on Facebook? Seems like a person with that kind of personality might end up being high profile somewhere.

Humanoidencounters,308yho,sniggity,2,Thu Mar 26 00:14:08 2015 UTC,"I tried, but no results :("
Humanoidencounters,308yho,gibsonhack,4,Wed Mar 25 19:28:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was a great story ! She definitely had some weird shit going on with her.  Like you said, it was either demonic, alien or even black magic.  I'm thinking she was alien.  Did anybody ever meet her parents?  If so, how were they, the same way or normal?"
Humanoidencounters,308yho,cashan0va_007,3,Wed Mar 25 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"I met her mom a few times at school events, she always wore black and I saw she had the same pentagram stuff on at times.  Maybe she is an ET who just disguises herself as human with her parents then? Or perhaps she's a wiccan and her mom taught her too."
Humanoidencounters,308yho,tpm_,5,Wed Mar 25 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, they were probably just wiccans, not aliens. Witches could sometimes seem to have supernatural abilities I suppose. Imposing your will on others is very witch-like behavior."
Humanoidencounters,308yho,cashan0va_007,3,Thu Mar 26 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your post, I really enjoyed reading it.  I have several questions regarding this persons physical attributes if you don't mind?    1) was her head oddly shaped, elongated, or did she have a sharp jaw line? 2) was she platinum blonde with fair white skin? I already know she was Caucasian. 3) aside from when her eyes flooded black (eyes are the window to the soul), did she ever try to cover or shield her eyes? 4) were her eyes oval or diamond shaped, or larger than regular people's eyes?   Thank you for sharing, that was a great read!"
Humanoidencounters,308yho,Bizrat7,5,Thu Mar 26 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"She did have a rather large head, but oddly enough happened to be a brunette. Yes her eyes were large and were searching, like she knew your thoughts just by looking at you. I would often get the sensation of being watched, and turn around in my seat only to catch her fixing gaze on me. And sometimes I just felt her looking at me, I was too creeped out to turn her way. Something in my gut told me she could hear my thoughts. And I'm glad you liked it :)"
Humanoidencounters,308yho,sirkirky,3,Thu Mar 26 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late to this thread, but as someone who has some experience with wicca and magick I'll give my two cents.  I'm not buying the alien or demon theory really. It seems like most alien stories I hear are fleeting, or if an alien is trying to look like a human they often don't do it convincingly enough (think of that famous alien encounter that occurred around the time of the Mothman sightings). Demons? I believe I've actually encountered a demon before, and they're spirits. I can't imagine one being a solid being long enough for something like this.  It is pretty terrifying to think though, even if I don't buy this theory, that an alien could be so convincingly human as to live life as a middle schooler for several years (and longer).  The pentagram is a witchcraft symbol. It's not necessarily bad. If she was wearing it all the time, she's almost definitely into wicca or some other kind of witchcraft. The fact that she can cause bad things to happen to other people, is charming, can bring good luck to herself, and even interfere with other people's thoughts/emotions are all things that you can do through magick. It just takes a lot of knowledge and ability. Wicca teaches us that you can use magick for good or bad. It sounds like this girl was using a lot of both.  The only thing that is weird about this story to me is how GOOD she was at doing all of these supernatural things, for being so young. I've heard of older women who have been doing magick for years being able to do shit like make people's roofs fall in, but nothing like this from a kid.  She's a witch prodigy maybe? Maybe her parents are also into this stuff?   The alien thing though, seems like a stretch to me. The demon thing even more so. I think you just have a highly unusual human being here..."

Humanoidencounters,307kf2,moonshinemonastery,6,Wed Mar 25 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"Bigfoot has been known to throw rocks and sticks, so if it was something cryptozoological I would say that's your best bet."

Humanoidencounters,307kf2,FizzPig,2,Wed Mar 25 17:10:12 2015 UTC,"Im not sayin it was sasquatch, but it was sasquatch..."
Humanoidencounters,307kf2,JackTheTrippa,4,Wed Mar 25 12:13:21 2015 UTC,"Did they say it was the same stick or a different one? Also, there are stories of reptilians living in underground cavern systems in pretty much the whole Midwest and northwest.  If it wasn't a Bigfoot or something like I suggested, whatever it was had to have one hell of an arm on it.  You'd need incredible strength to throw something ten stories high !"
Humanoidencounters,307kf2,sniggity,3,Wed Mar 25 04:02:32 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression it was the same stick. And I didn't even think of anything reptilian. That's a really interesting angle, definitely something I'm going to look into. Do you have any sources you suggest I look into?   The speed and height at which that stick was thrown definitely steers me away from it just being someone messing around."
Humanoidencounters,307kf2,sniggity,3,Wed Mar 25 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"The reason I asked about the stick is because I was thinking maybe something was in a tree and broke off a different stick and threw it back.  But it was more than likely a Sasquatch that did it.  I mean, there aren't too many reptilians in that area! but it's not unheard of for them to be up there and be aggressive. As far as sources, honestly, I'd probably just use google and start there.  But yeah, now that I slept on it, I'm thinking squatch. It was definitely something powerful, had to be, obviously.  It's a good story though, thanks for letting us know about it."
Humanoidencounters,305wzk,fionaharris,6,Tue Mar 24 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, this gives new meaning to ""Walmart shoppers"". Lol. What a weird sounding creature.  I'd love to see the damn video footage from the store that day.  In fact, I think I would've personally went and asked the manager for it, after I explained what I saw.  I'd either get it or get arrested for them thinking I was crazy. Lol"
Humanoidencounters,305wzk,sniggity,4,Tue Mar 24 19:18:05 2015 UTC,Me too! And I would have gone up the other frightened shopper and asked her exactly what she saw!  And what I would like to know is this:  What was in the Alien's shopping cart?
Humanoidencounters,305wzk,sniggity,8,Tue Mar 24 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"Haha, you look in it's cart and see a case of KY Jelly for probing.  Lol"

Humanoidencounters,300kpm,wordblender,4,Mon Mar 23 18:15:32 2015 UTC,Very cool story. I wonder if there was ever any photos taken of him? BEK stories are always so unnerving. That's the first I've read of one being born into a normal family.
Humanoidencounters,300kpm,PandorasPanda,3,Tue Mar 24 03:52:12 2015 UTC,I've never heard a story like this before. Wow. How interesting!!! My mind takes this in so many different directions.
Humanoidencounters,2zynz5,Brummer65,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"from that link: Time of Sighting: 12:30 AM PST Date Sighting Reported: April 26, 2008 Duration of Sighting: Few Seconds Location of Sighting: Gresham-Boring, Oregon Area (See Map) Latitude: 45.47 Degrees North Longitude: 122.39 Degrees West Number of Witnesses: Two Number of Witnesses Interviewed: One Weather: Clear Skies. Visibility 10 Miles. Winds Were From the East at 14 MPH.  Description: A girlfriend and I were driving east on Highway 26 towards Mt. Hood. This creature crossed the highway in 3 strides. The creature was about 10 ft maybe 12 ft tall. It was very skinny very tall, and all one color (grayish). It kind of looked like a stick. It was about 12:30 in the morning. We never reported it because people would of thought we were crazy, but someone else must of seen it besides us because the next day there were cop cars in the same exact spot I had seen the alien. Anyway thanks. Feel free to contact me.  Comments: I have requested sketches of what the witnesses saw. The witness who reported the sighting has concluded that the creature was alien. Of course we don't know the identity of the creature. At 12:30 in the morning much fewer people would be driving so it is unlikely that anyone would have seen the same creature."
Humanoidencounters,2zub0m,wordblender,6,Sat Mar 21 21:07:45 2015 UTC,Holy shit ! That was a wild encounter.  I wonder what the hell she was doing?
Humanoidencounters,2zub0m,sniggity,4,Sat Mar 21 21:47:53 2015 UTC,"I wonder that too! Like she went into the back room to 'reset' or something... Or maybe she was planning on something much more diabolical, since she had him alone in the restaurant... This black eyed person story is one of the creepiest I've ever read."
Humanoidencounters,2zub0m,Droog_7,3,Sat Mar 21 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"They must get something from human fear. She could have killed him several times over by the time he got out of there, if that was her intent. I wonder if he ever drove back that way."
Humanoidencounters,2zub0m,Droog_7,3,Sun Mar 22 22:37:08 2015 UTC,Very good point and I hadn't thought of it that way. She definitely could have killed him in the amount of time she was with him. Very interesting...
Humanoidencounters,2zub0m,sniggity,3,Sun Mar 22 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this account. Black-eyed people stories fascinate me. On one hand, they appear to have been made up in the 90s. On the other, there are so many encounters pointing towards them being a separate race or species that is at least as old as we are. I've found reports of them in some strange places, like domestic abuse survivor forums. I have to find the one I just read about the guy that claims to have actually taken care of a black-eyed kid."
Humanoidencounters,2zub0m,Droog_7,3,Sun Mar 22 23:04:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes, please post the story if you find it. Black eyed people stories fascinate me too. I collect them to re-read and study.

When we were dating, we used to sneak into this really trashy bar in Vancouver (can't remember what it was called). We got in a couple of times, then got ID'd and never went back. Me and him were only a couple for a month or so when I was in grade 11.  Shortly after I broke up with him, he got a new girlfriend, and promptly got her pregnant! They didn't stay together, because they were so young. I totally lost touch with him after that.  About 10 years later, I was meeting a friend for drinks downtown, and he suggested that same trashy bar (still just as awful and trashy as it used to be). We had some drinks, and I told him about Dave Knutsen and his gnome, and his UFO, and how we used to drink here.  Suddenly, out of the crowd of people, comes Dave Knutsen!!! Right when I was talking about him!  My friend was blown away.  What was cool was that HE hadn't been back to that bar since he and I had gone in. In fact, he wasn't living in Vancouver anymore-he was teaching English overseas somewhere. He was back for a holiday, and thought that he'd take a trip down memory lane.  So he sad and had some drinks with us. Very cool. I'd love to find him again!"

Her role in the house is usually juxtaposed with that of the domovoy, whereas one of them is considered a ""bad"" spirit, and the other, a ""good"" one. When the kikimora inhabits a house, she lives behind the stove or in the cellar, and usually produces noises similar to those made by the mice in order to obtain food.

Also, and I realize this proves nothing, but I've worked with children in various capacities for over 10 years and this is not the drawing of a 5 yr. old. This is an adult drawing how they think a 5 yr. old draws. The thing is perfectly symmetrical!  And everything; face, hands, eyes, is completely in proportion to the overall frame. Children don't draw that way. Children draw based on their impression, which usually makes height and faces the main focus. And even the body hair is drawn with even, disciplined strokes in such a way to imply texture. No, this isn't a kid's drawing. Im sorry but something stinks here."
Humanoidencounters,2xdtjz,abbie_yoyo,2,Sat Feb 28 06:14:23 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible.  When I saw the ""buttons"" I thought that maybe the one who drew it thought it was a suit or costume it had on.  And yes, kids usually draw all over the place at five years old.

Humanoidencounters,2wh2xs,fionaharris,2,Fri Feb 20 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"The eruption- there is not much to say. I was about 11 or 12, and living in Victoria, BC.. sleeping at a friends house, on a Sunday, at around 9 in the morning..There was this immense WHAM!! We were in my friend's basement, and I was afraid that maybe the roof had fallen in upstairs!! I lay there for a while, wondering.. then later found out what it really was.  As for the robed men, I am not certain that this forum is the place for it. It was both the most amazing, and the most fucked up thing that I have ever seen (and I have seen some very bizarre things!). It was more of a vision, but felt completely real, and looked completely real! I feel that it was some form of interdimensional type thing. If you want me to tell you more, I will. I can see those two guys in my minds eye right now, as if it were yesterday, and it was really about 16 or 17 years ago.  I have some other things that I may post here when I have a bit of time. I saw a Sasquatch in 1982. And I have a really freaky story about a man dressed all in orange who tried to get into a friend's place once- she and her roommate both said that the man was not human.

Humanoidencounters,2wh2xs,fionaharris,3,Fri Feb 20 07:30:30 2015 UTC,"Hey Sniggity- I will tell you about the two guys in white now!  This was probably around the same time as when my friends saw the guy dressed in orange- around 1996-97.  I had gotten my 2nd degree in Reiki and was doing tons of healings on people, and also meditating a fair bit. But this one night, I had gone out drinking with my boyfriend, and slept in late the next morning.  It was summertime, and our bed was right beside the window. If you slept late, the sun poured in, onto the bed-my favourite way to wake up!  My boyfriend left early for work, and I was dead asleep. It was late morning-around 11, and I was dreaming about being in a bedroom. Kind of a dark bedroom. Just looking at a wall.  I started to wake up.   I opened my eyes, and I was still in the dream!!!!  I find this so hard to describe, but imagine that your body is awake, but the dream is still stuck in your eyes!!   I could see the wall of the room. It was an older room, with no window (at least on the wall that I was looking at). The room was dim. I couldn't really discern any walllpaper,more of just a darkish wall. There was a bed-a single bed, no headboard or anything. I kind of felt that maybe it was a room that I had lived in when I was tiny.  I was scared that I could still see this room. I felt as if I was trapped. I started to panic. I opened my eyes WIDE, and stared at the sun coming into my room (I couldn't see it, but I could feel that it was strong enough to kind of irritate my eyes).  Suddenly, the room that I was looking at began to disintegrate- almost as if it were made of bricks and they were crumbling.  I was back in reality!   And of course, as soon as I was back, I was mad at myself for not staying!! Why didn't I turn me head and look around the room? Why didn't I go and explore the house or space that I was in. I was so pissed1  The second that I thought that, I suddenly felt my head falling back onto the pillow, and my focus went inward, almost as if I were fainting. I went back into the dream!  But this time, there were two men sitting on the bed!!  I have to explain, that this felt as real as any real life meeting with someone. I have lucid dreamed, many times, and this was NOT like a lucid dream! It was totally freaking real! My heart was pounding so hard against my chest, and I was sweating, but so excited, as well. It felt as if all of my hours of meditation had paid off somehow and that these two men were guides, coming to tell me something really amazing.  This is how they looked:  They were both in their mid twenties, early thirties. They were wearing white robes and white turban type wraps on their heads. They both had tangly,long blond hair. One guy was 'the leader', I could kind of tell. The other guy, I could tell was gay!! Even in strange visions, my gadar works!  One of the really strange things was that the main guy had an upside down red triangle on his forehead- right in the third eye area!  They were so excited that I could see them. They were sitting on the edge of their seats, looking as if they wanted to jump up and down.  I was so stressed, and worried that I'd wake up. I tried to speak, but I was so nervous, that all I could get out was a strangled 'HHHHHiiiiiiiiiiiiii.....'  the second that I said 'Hi', the guy with the red triangle jumped up and asked 'Do you remember me?'  I actually lied and said yes, even though I didn't remember him! I was afraid that if I said no, the interview would be over!!  As soon as I said 'yes', he jumped up, and was right in my face. His face started morphing into all of these faces (past life, perhaps?). Then he said the one thing that just ruined it all for me:  In the sweetest, most caring voice, he said 'I'm so happy that you're poor!'  The second he said that, I jolted awake in disappointment. Out of all the amazing things that this person from another dimension could tell me 'I'm so happy that you're poor.' was pretty much at the bottom of my list!  Not sure what he meant by it. Maybe in a past life, I was rich and shallow, and now in this life, I was struggling and it was good for me.  I lay in my bed for probably an hour afterward, blown away by what I had just experienced, and disappointed that it wasn't longer and that he didn't give me some amazing knowledge of some sort...   A year or so later, my step Grandfather had had a stroke and was living in a tiny apartment in the same city as me. I used to go and visit him every Saturday and do some cleaning up, and kitchen prep and stuff to help him out. He was very metaphysical, and we would have long talks about life. One day, we were talking about the third eye, and he gave me a book that I think was called 'The Third Eye in History'.. It was from the 70s, and had tons of coloured pictures of art and carvings depicting the third eye.  I was astonished when I was going through the book one day, and came upon a picture of a stained glass window from a church in Germany. It was a portrait of a Saint named Erhard.   He was the guy on the bed!!! Or I should say, he looked just like him!!!! With a triangle (though his was rightside up in the picture). But the same white clothing, turban, and blonde hair.  I lent the book out and never got it back, but I kept checking the internet, hoping that the picture of the stained glass window would show up. It finally did, a few years later, but the colour from the book was different. On the internet photograph, the triangle is darker. Not red, and his hair is grey. In the book, the triangle was red, and his hair was blonde. Here is a link to it:   http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-erhard-of-regensburg/  I have never seen the two men again. I truly believe that they were interdimensional and that it was not a dream, not a lucid dream- but an actual vision. I would love to have it happen again. I think that the main thing was that I was doing so much mediation and healing. I have two kids now, and I'm so busy, but I can't wait until the day that I can get back into that type of thing."

Humanoidencounters,2wh2xs,fionaharris,2,Fri Feb 20 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"The Sasquatch sighting: This was in 1982. I was in Grade 8, and my sister and I (she was a year younger) were visiting my Grandma and Step Grandpa in Calgary Alberta. It was summertime, and my sister and I would stay up late watching TV, then go to bed around 2:00AM.  We had just gotten to bed (we were sharing a room and a bed at the back of the house, which was a bungalow). Our window was open, with a screen in it.  Outside, we heard a loud roar!! It was like no animal that I have ever heard. The only thing that I could liken it to was the sound of the Tasmanian Devil on the Loony Tunes cartoons! But not so fast. It was very loud. Loud enough to awaken the whole entire neighbourhood (at this time, no one had air conditioning, and it was a hot night, so everyone would have had their windows wide open).  It was obvious that this animal was not being furtive or sneaky. It didn't care who heard it. It sounded frustrated or angry. We could hear it tearing apart at the garbage cans. At this point, we thought that it was a dog-even though it's sound was not dog like in any way.  My sister popped up from the bed to look out the window. She dropped down right away and said 'It's an ape!'  I looked at her like she was crazy, but she did look scared, so I didn't think that she was faking, just to scare me.  I stood up on the bed to look.  I couldn't freaking believe it. There was a creature standing over the garbage cans, digging through them!  This thing, which I could see right away wasn't a normal ape that had perhaps escaped from the zoo. It was taller than any man I have ever seen in life! I would say that it was about 7 feet tall. I am not good with measurements or distances, but I am good with comparisons. This thing could not have walked under any doorway without having to hunch down.   It was ape like, naked, and although I couldn't see any genitals( I think that the fur was thicker there, but also, he was sideways to us) I could tell by his build, even his facial features, that he was male. His fur was a light to medium brown, and kind of long. I wouldn't say that it was thick and furry, more that it was long and furry and you could kind of see the skin under it.  Our back yard was open to the alley, with a carport beside it. The yard was not very big- just a typical inner city type yard, maybe a tiny bit smaller than most. It was nighttime, but there was streetlight fairly close to the alley, and possibly there was moonlight. It was not dark at all, and very easy to see him and distinguish his features. His arms were VERY long. It looked out of place for his body.  He pulled a plastic bag out of the garbage and put it in his mouth, then pulled it out and roared in disgust!! At this moment, I realized that if he turned and saw us (or heard us- we weren't screaming, but we were exclaiming, talking loudly, giggling with fear) he could bolt across the yard, and rip through our screen window in seconds).  I dropped back down the bed, and my sister jumped up to look. We were both SWEATING with fear!! We took turns looking at him, then dropping, freaking out, discussing whether we should get my Grandpa (who was kind of grumpy and not overly excited at having his wife's grandchildren staying over).  At this point, my Grandpa heard us and came into our room, wearing his short tan velour housecoat (which in retrospect, was perhaps ever more terrifying than the Sasquatch outside) and started giving us hell! We told him to look out the window (the roaring had stopped, but maybe the S was still out there). He refused and told us to stop being silly and go back to bed.  We lay there for probably an hour, going over what we had just seen  (we looked out the window and it was gone).   In the morning, both our garbage and a neigbours had been torn apart (dogs, my Grandpa said).   My sister and I combed the newspaper for a week, hoping to hear of any Sasquatch sitings, or of an escaped ape from the zoo. Nothing. The only thing that we did read was that there had been some cattle mutilations somewhere in Albert-Nowhere near Calgary, as far as I can remember.  What my sister and I could never figure out, was where it came from and where it went. Calgary isn't a really big city, and the area where we were (Marlborough) is just houses, houses, houses, mini mall school field, etc etc. No forest, no nothing.  How could a Sasquatch (and a loud one, at that!) go undetected in a residential area? Even though we were young, and there wasn't a lot out there that you could look up (no internet, not a lot of books on the subject), we both decided that he was either interdimensional or that he came from a UFO!  We were scared to walk down our alley after that-we were scared that if he wasn't interdimensional, then perhaps he was hiding in between a garage, or under someone's deck, waiting to attack us when we went to 7/11 to buy slurpees!  Years later, as an adult, I brought this up with my Grandpa. He told me that he did believe my sister and I ! He was just too afraid to look outside!   I also brought up the Sasquatch with my sister and an adult, and asked her to describe it to me, just to see if our memories matched, and her description was bang on with mine! She said that his height and arms reminded her of Alice the Goon from the Popeye cartoons!"
Humanoidencounters,2wh2xs,Ropestar,1 point,Fri Feb 20 13:50:18 2015 UTC,"The man in orange.  This one fascinates me! I wish that I had been there, except that my friends were terrified!  This happened around 1996. I was working in a cafe in Vancouver BC. This was in East Van, so kind of a sketchy, but cool neighbourhood. I had a coworker who lived a couple of blocks away in an old victorian house that had been converted into two suites.   One weekend, Davida and her roommate were hanging out at home. It was summertime, fairly busy neighbourhood, middle of the day. They heard someone knocking at their door. Assuming that it was the downstairs neighbours. The main door downstairs was locked, with two buzzers outside for suite A, or B. Davida was suite B, which was upstairs. The tenants shared the entrance way. If someone buzzed them, they had to leave their apartment and run down the 'lobby' stair and open the door. there was  no intercom. So when someone knocked on the door, that meant that they had already gained access to the house, so that would be their downstairs neighbours.  Davida opened the door, and the second she did that, this guy started walking/pushing his way in!  Davida didn't know who he was, but assumed that he was some freak who had somehow gotten through the locked front door (maybe it had been left open by mistake). This was a rough neighbourhood, so immediately, she and her roommate were alarmed.  She asked him who he wanted-thinking that maybe he wanted the downstairs people. And without establishing eye contact, and without speaking or acting aggressively, he just kept saying 'I'm here to see Joe. Can you let me in?'  They told him that there was no Joe in the building, so he changed his story 'Can I just use your phone?'  At this point, Vanessa was helping to push him out. He never got violent with them, and never established eye contact, but he kept pushing against them.  They pushed him out and locked the door. He continued to knock for a few minutes and then all was quiet.  A few minutes later, their buzzer rang. Davida went downstairs to check it, worried that it was maybe the guy again. She looked out the window, and no one was there!! She opened the door, and looked around. There was no one, and not really anywhere to run to or hide.  She came back upstairs, puzzled.   The buzzer rang again!! She ran down again, fast. Same thing- nobody there. At this point, she called her boyfriend. As she was on the phone with him, the buzzer was still ringing. She ran downstairs, telling him about what is going on at the same time. The buzzer was still buzzing as she got to the door! But still no one was there! She whipped open the door, and this time, there was no way that he could have gotten away so quickly!   She went back upstairs, and her boyfriend said that he'd be there soon. They had a big balcony on the front of the house. She and Vanessa went and sat on the balcony, waiting for the boyfriend. The buzzer started buzzing again!! There happened to be a man getting out of his car on the opposite side to them. They called out and asked him who it was who was at their door. The guy said that there was no one there!!  Now, let me describe him to you: He was in his early 20s, afro american, and dressed entirely in orange!! there was nothing on his body that wasn't orange! His tshirt, pants, running shoes, and even the laces were orange. He may have had an orange jacket (I can't remember). His hair was cut short and he had the THICKEST pair of coke bottle lens glasses that they had ever seen in their lives!!   The both of them felt that he wasn't human. His voice was monotone, no eye contact, the strange clothes. And they said that the clothes weren't the kind of clothes where he just bought orange clothes and wore them all together. They looked as if they had all been made at the same factory!  To them, it seemed as if he was trying to act human, but doing a shitty job of it.  What happened afterward? The buzzer continued to ring every few minutes.. stopped before the boyfriend got there, and they never saw that guy again.  I wonder what might have happened if they had let him in?"

These stories are generally characterized by an encounter - when no one else is around - with a humanoid being that has all black eyes, who is trying to get the narrator to let them in somewhere or do something for them or somehow permit them to do something.  The narrator generally reports a sense of dread, as well.  I suppose the implication is that the narrator has a choice in the outcome - or that the Black Eyed figure needs to be explicitly admitted by the narrator in order to do something - and that if they complied with the Black Eyed figure, they would be victimized in some way.  I've not heard these stories mention the smell or the peculiar way of walking...but, I haven't read them all.  Nevertheless, I recommend googling ""Black Eyed Children"" or ""Black Eyed Kids"" as a way to identify potentially related reports."

After confronting the teenager in a not so friendly manner he emptied his pockets and swore up and down that he was not doing anything, he had just waled out to the car.

My guess is a guardian angel and the other a demon. But what are really angels and demons? Aliens? spirits with the ability to take human  form? interdimensional beings? This is fascinating.

Humanoidencounters,2t3dl5,cashan0va_007,4,Wed Jan 21 01:40:56 2015 UTC,This one sounds like sleep paralysis.
Humanoidencounters,2t3dl5,Andh0w,2,Tue Jan 20 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same when I read it. I hope not, though.  I usually don't put up reports of encounters people have while in bed or sleeping for this exact reason.  I guess this one jumped out at me. Heh..."
Humanoidencounters,2t3dl5,Down_The_Witch_Elm,2,Wed Jan 21 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"As someone who suffers from sleep paralysis and has had sleep paralysis for 50 years, I can tell you that this does NOT sound like sleep paralysis.  I remember during  the UFO wave of the 1960s seeing Dr. Hynec on television debunking every UFO sighting.   UFOs were always either the planet Venus or swamp gas.  It seems the same thing is happening now with accounts of people seeing odd things at night.  Sleep paralysis.  Case closed.    I can only speak for myself, but the dividing line between the sleep paralysis experience and the waking world is very clear.  I have experienced the sound of my dresser drawers being opened and closed, women speaking in low voices in another room, the feeling of someone sitting on the edge of my bed, all while paralyzed and terrified, but by moving a part of my body, usually my leg, repeatedly, I am able to wake myself.  As soon as I wake, the world is normal, and I know it was just sleep paralysis.  Sleep paralysis does not explain experiences like this."
Humanoidencounters,2t3dl5,Down_The_Witch_Elm,2,Fri Jan 23 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"I have debated with people on other subs about sleep paralysis before too.  I'm in agreement with you 100% and it's another reason I'm careful about putting up stories that have to do with sleeping and witnessing something paranormal, because the first explanation for a lot of folks is indeed, sleep paralysis. There is a lot of that going on over at /r/ghosts and /r/thetruthishere I actually got tired of reading the replies because of it. Thanks for joining in with your experience.  Do you have any encounters to share?"
Humanoidencounters,2t3cg1,sniggity,5,Tue Jan 20 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"Obviously some sort of negative entities.   Or a negative reaction to neutral/indifferent entities.

Humanoidencounters,2sf5fn,sniggity,3,Wed Jan 14 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"There are lots of wierd things sometimes associated with Bigfoot sightings and UFO sightings.  Sometimes there seems to almost be a deliberate ""stranger than fiction"" element to some of these occurrences, maybe to discredit the witnesses or due to the nature of these experiences being something beyond our current level of understanding and the paradigms that we currently use to structure our reality.    John A Keel detailed some of these in his books, like the Mothman Prophecies.  There is also some sort of correlation with unusually bad weather and both UFO and Bigfoot encounters."
Humanoidencounters,2sf5fn,chintzy,3,Thu Jan 15 15:59:41 2015 UTC,"Right ! I've noticed that a lot of the ""double encounters"" with both a UFO and a bigfoot are really bizarre and are almost unbelievable.

I personally believe in black magic because it's really rampant in India and I have seen it's effects on peoples lives, most cause illness or division between loved ones.

Humanoidencounters,2rnie1,ASK47,5,Thu Jan 8 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence on this one. I do believe we can sense menacing presences, and supernatural explanations like ""demonic"" possession are viable explanations to me (despite the suspension of incredulity that go with them). This guy may have even believed it himself, which would probably augment the creepy factor.  My question is, would it be possible to find a bunch of drunk guys and mess with them in such a manner purely as a prank? Like, even with some special effects for the eyes? I wouldn't put it past some people.  When I was a teenager, I was sitting in this large church basement stairwell/waiting area once, waiting for a friend to be done with choir rehearsal, just reading and minding my own business. A woman came in and sat down on the other side of the room. I smiled politely, but did nothing more. Unfortunately, the wait became unbearably long, so I left to stretch my legs.  As it happened, this woman's husband/boyfriend came in as I ascended the stairs, and as I climbed the second flight (they probably thought I was out of earshot) I happened to overhear her telling him how creeped out she was by me, saying I didn't seem human! This annoyed me, as I hadn't done anything remotely creepy. Nor would you have thought it; I look normal enough and plenty of people have even told me I'm handsome (I am on the fence on this as well :).  Minutes later I came back in. I decided to go back to the top of the stairs to see if they were still talking about me, so I went over to the top of the railing to overhear more. My steps were loud enough that they ended up looking right up at me in shock, and I could totally feel their fear and dis-ease. I think I accidentally picked the perfect moment to confirm their suspicions, but it was all coincidence."
Humanoidencounters,2rnie1,ASK47,3,Thu Jan 8 18:54:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, interesting story.  I guess some people fall into a certain frame of mind easier than others.

The bigfoot lore one encounters in Western culture never presents this data, but with all the anecdotal correlation I've seen in the humanoid encounter databases, I agree that it is the latter as well."
Humanoidencounters,2q1zhl,ASK47,2,Mon Dec 22 16:52:50 2014 UTC,"Did you see the incident that was on the show Monsters and Mysteries in America, where these two people were in a vehicle down by the water and they see the light from a UFO and a few minutes later they see a giant, hairy Bigfoot walk up to the car and start shaking it?!! Lol If I remember correctly, I think their car had a flat or was stalled or something and they were trapped there.  My god, could you imagine the fear? I always thought that was a pretty good report, mainly because there were a few police who showed up later on and found some evidence.  There are so many other reports that correlate with these creatures and UFOs though, it's really interesting."
Humanoidencounters,2q1zhl,ASK47,2,Mon Dec 22 18:23:56 2014 UTC,"Never heard of the show. I tend to avoid paranormal entertainment; it is ultimately unsatisfying and annoying.  One encounter from the DHE that sticks in my memory is where such an entity was seen emerging from the woods, walked up to a house at which point it could not be seen from inside, a single loud knock against the house was heard, and that was it. Something about that scenario is intriguing, because the knock is like a statement: ""yeah, you saw me."""

Humanoidencounters,2q1zhl,Ikari_Shinji_kun_01,4,Mon Dec 22 15:38:10 2014 UTC,"I have a bachelor degree in anthropology. One thing they drill into you at university is how close Neanderthals looked to us. They may not have fully gone extinct either, instead they could have interbred with other early humans. Anyway, some modern human phenotypes are pretty much indistinguishable from them, my excessively hairy old self included.  Comparing what I've learned from reading about BF encounters, they do not resemble what we anthropologists believe Neanderthals looked like at all. There is another hypothesis (which I don't subscribe to either) that says BF is, or evolved from, a long-extinct large primate called Gigantopithecus, which more closely resembled gorillas (and some descriptions/images of BF). In the end it is impossible to speculate as to what sort of genetic lineage they had, because one has never been discovered and genetically analyzed.  If BF has a terrestrial and hominid origin, the best ancestral candidate would be the Australopithecenes, in my opinion. The majority encounters I've read about describe them as more gracile than the stocky frame of Neanderthals. That famous movie of the black-haired dome-headed bigfoot is an exception, though."
Humanoidencounters,2q1zhl,ASK47,1 point,Tue Dec 23 00:13:50 2014 UTC,"ASK47, didn't a report come out a few years back stating that humans are NOT related to Neanderthal?  Is this still the way scientists are seeing it or have they gone back to the theory that we ARE related ?"

Humanoidencounters,2pyiqm,ASK47,3,Sun Dec 21 22:17:49 2014 UTC,"Actually we can pretty much post what we want on this subreddit.  Comments and discussions are about the story itself, not where it was taken from."

Please take what I said as a suggestion, not as a directive; I'm not trying to control you or anything. Overall I think the internet suffers when content is duplicated, but especially when there is no trail of reference. The standard I've seen on Reddit is by and large what I described: discussions about links to content on another site.  I'd love to see more actual discussion here, but I don't understand your motives for reproducing all this content you post. Maybe you could start there. Also I submit that your current method hasn't produced many discussions. That's unfortunate. The main thing I'm looking for, if you're going to continue copying and pasting, is to make what you copy and paste more engaging, but that will take a little more effort to be sure.  You never answered my previous question, so I'm asking it again - where are you getting these posts from? And why are you worried I'll go away if you disclose it? I told you I won't, but then it also depends on your social participation. TL;DR what's your game, man? :)"
Humanoidencounters,2pyiqm,ASK47,1 point,Sun Dec 21 23:09:59 2014 UTC,"I really have no ""game"" other than to share humanoid encounters.  I would ABSOLUTELY LOVE people to post their own encounters and to generate discussion.  I honestly don't see how me posting a link to the same, exact story will generate discussion in all honesty, see what I'm saying?  Basically you would click the link and see verbatim what is in front of you right here. I would rather post the link that is IN THE STORY because that's who it was initially reported to, I.e. MUFON or nuforc or manns or whatever.    I don't know why discussion isn't generated either, there has been some, but maybe that's due to there being a low subscription count for the time being. Maybe if there were more people here it would pick up a bit?  Over at other similar subs, those guys have thousands of subscribers.  All I ask of anyone who comes here is to help spread the word if you like it.    I'm posting the stories because they're are cool and also to keep this place from becoming stagnate.  The sites I use are all over the web.  I use phantoms and monsters, ufocenter and a few others.  I'd rather not paste the main sites because if people can go there and read all the stories, why would they need to come back here?  If you go to a porn sub that posts pictures if big butted women five per day, would you come back to that sub if the moderator went ahead and just posted the whole site from where he gets his pics and then you can see hundreds of those pics at once?  Coming back here would be a snoozefest, wouldn't it?  I hope you see my game a little better now ? :)"

No, because all over Reddit, I see links to the content, and not reproduced content. I'm pretty sure the people who designed Reddit intended this particular usage more than what you do.   I don't know why discussion isn't generated either   I suggest that it is due to a lack of structure, both of information, and socially. You are aggregating without a purpose to your aggregation (though your response here finally addresses some of it). But even worse: you are selectively omitting relevant information, solely because you perceive the traffic to this sub as being more valuable than the participation that could emerge with just a little more commentary on your part.   use phantoms and monsters, ufocenter and a few others.    May we have links, please?   why would they need to come back here?   For the discussions! You don't even post comments in all these, you just reproduce the content and move on! BORING   If you go to a porn sub    Pick a better analogy. Seriously. Pornography is hardly the same as encounter stories. (I didn't even know there were porn subs! Something tells me the dynamic in those are very different than the rest of Reddit.)  TL;DR Reddit is a round hole, while you're trying to make this sub a square peg.  edit: my apologies for the awkward juxtaposition of the two paragraphs above!"

I always wondered if these beings are not what humans call the angels. Since angels are represented, talls, flying with wings and magnificent. There is may be a link. If the witness had observed the humanoid without having seen it get off the ship and in another context, he would certainly have reported seeing an angel. I also notice that the witness was involved in other encounters. It is pretty interesting. Aliens and ""angels"" evolve in different frequencies than us humans wich prevent us to see them unless they voluntarily place themselves in our frequency or if witnesses have special abilities to see into other frequencies or sometimes children. It seems that this witness had this ability. The humanoid certainly thought not being detected."

I.e the 2nd case, i saw the daughter of my neighbor enter our building with her boyfriend as usual and few days later i was talking with her mother and asked about her daughter and she told me: Oh you didn't know? my daughter and her boyfriend died 3 weeks ago in a bike accident. No i didn't know because i was abroad in vacation:-o .  All the other encounters are unknown entities . In fact, i had some interest in paranormal and UFO (especially UFO for which i have interest since i was 7 years, which is pretty weird since i grew up in a remote part of Africa and my parents and relatives were not of all into that) but i never saw something until 2004 (and didn't look for by the way) . I made lot of oui-ja sessions alone (Wrong idea) in my home and suddenly i was able to experiment paranormal things: See unknown entities (as the tiny creature i described here), tap into another dimensions and pick up things into. I experimented that between 2004 and 2007, then it stopped. After 2007 ,I saw nothing more until today. About UFO, nothing interesting. Never seen but twice( in 90's and in 2007), i saw in my room tonight, multicolor color beams illuminating the room and appearing to come from the outside but when I looked out, there was nothing.   So yes, it is possible that some people are attracted to paranormal more than others."

I knew you probably had seen other paranormal events.  Most people who witness one thing usually experience a few other things.  The same thing has happened to my dad and grandmother.  They both have had many paranormal things happen to them.  Where in Africa did you grow up?  That is awesome you are from Africa !"

Humanoidencounters,2nxr7t,TheNotoriousKAZ,3,Mon Dec 1 13:15:34 2014 UTC,"This one IS unique. No hands or feet and a giant head! It reminds me of the Pascagoula Encounter.  The beings had totally impractical bodies that just didn't make sense, but the circumstances of the event are just so believable that you can't help but to think it happened just as they report !"
Humanoidencounters,2nxr7t,sniggity,2,Wed Dec 3 00:20:12 2014 UTC,"To be honest, when ever I read the description of this entity, I can't help but get reminded of the antagonist from the Japanese  survival horror game, Ao oni, as it fits the description well except Big Head is (presumably) black in color and had glowing red eyes. If reports are true, I believe its an alien."
Humanoidencounters,2nx48k,cashan0va_007,3,Mon Dec 1 06:46:18 2014 UTC,"I wonder if the Dover Demon is an alien or an extra-dimensional being? The description along with the several drawing/sketches by witnesses does suggest an extra-terrestrial entity, but of course, we can be wrong about that. Still interesting, I will have to say the witnesses are, in a way, lucky to be able to encounter such a creature, hehe."
Humanoidencounters,2nx48k,TheNotoriousKAZ,2,Mon Dec 1 07:39:45 2014 UTC,"I agree, this thing's body is completely impractical. I'd love to know what these things really are, though. Interdimensional, extraterrestrial, terrestrial ?"
Humanoidencounters,2nx48k,sniggity,2,Wed Dec 3 00:24:55 2014 UTC,"It might belong to the same category as the creatures seen by the Cree nation, due to the similarities in their description. This is definitely interesting."

Humanoidencounters,2nx48k,sniggity,2,Wed Dec 3 05:09:42 2014 UTC,There's an article on the Mannaegishi on Wikipedia. Their descriptions are similar to the Dover Demon.
Humanoidencounters,2nx48k,TheNotoriousKAZ,2,Thu Dec 4 12:09:57 2014 UTC,"Mannegishi:       The Mannegishi (singular the same) are a race of trickster people in Cree folklore, similar in nature to the Memegwesi of the Ojibwa. They are described as semi-humanoid, being sexdactylous humans with very thin and lanky arms and legs and big heads minus a nose. According to one Cree schema of the mythology, there are two humanoid races, one being the familiar human species and the other being the ""little people"", i.e. Mannegishi. These people are said to live between rocks in the rapids. One of their biggest delights -- a completely non-heroic form of trickster behavior -- is to crawl out of the rocks and capsize the canoes of people canoeing through the rapids, spinning them to their death.

I remember reading this encounter a few years back and because of them speaking actual English to the witness, it really stuck in my memory. It's really one that makes you think.  Is it a top secret craft? Are they ""aliens"" or are they more sort of time travelers?  Whoever they are, they surely don't tolerate some dude shooting at them.  Haha, can you imagine? You shoot at this weird looking craft and they open up and tell you to stop and call you an idiot? Lol"

Humanoidencounters,2nv89v,cashan0va_007,2,Mon Dec 1 06:20:58 2014 UTC,True that.  Tommy guns had the circular magazines that could hold 50 to a 100 rounds too.

If ""Fluorescent Freddie"" is not a Bigfoot, then he's most likely an extra-terrestrial or extra-dimensional being.

Freaky, huh?"
Humanoidencounters,2nq68d,sniggity,2,Sat Nov 29 08:04:18 2014 UTC,"Absolutely.  In all honesty, I think bigfoot could be an alien species anyways.  I think maybe they could have been put here by another alien race, maybe they are another planet's undesirables?  Who knows?  They could be sentenced here for a crime or...they may just like living here.  I do know this, they ARE extremely intelligent and evade capture using means that we may not understand, like, some sort of possible technology. Then again, they may just be some sort of hominid that hasn't been discovered yet.  But too many people have seen them (myself included) for scientists to continue to ignore them !"
Humanoidencounters,2nq68d,sniggity,1 point,Sat Nov 29 08:13:47 2014 UTC,"I've read up about those theories and I do think it's an interesting perspective. After all, there have been sightings of extra-terrestrial and extra-dimensional beings that do fit the description of Bigfoot... such as ""Fluorescent Freddie"" and ""Old Orange Eyes""... and let's not forget that report from Chile involving an aquatic, Bigfoot-type creature."

Humanoidencounters,2npnmc,sniggity,1 point,Sat Nov 29 00:01:08 2014 UTC,The being left but didn't come back inside the craft. Interesting. Sounds like these humanoid sightings are the result of them leaving certain members here probing for information.
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,TheNotoriousKAZ,9,Thu Nov 27 01:27:09 2014 UTC,How could you ever trust your friend again in the future knowing that he really may just be a cloaked space monster?
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,Hogmaster_General,8,Thu Nov 27 15:39:15 2014 UTC,"Not likely... BUT I understand there are things from her story that may raise such a suspicion. A theory I have regarding the ""silhouette filled with static"" in the shape of her boyfriend is that its cloaking device failed and when my friend screamed, it went ""Well, shit"" and retreated. Not long after her boyfriend returned roughly 10 to 15 minutes after the encounter and telling her she was just hallucinating despite being able to tell she was scared as fuck. It really makes you wonder, hmm... though I still think it's not likely K is actually an alien in disguise, ehehehehe."
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,SpastixFantastix,7,Thu Nov 27 23:43:23 2014 UTC,"This was my thought as well.  The boyfriend is an alien and his suit screwed up.  He got excited for the boobs he loved either not knowing his suit was failing or hoping she might like him for how he really is but then had to run off when she freaked.  He returns later, after repairing the malfunction.  It would be more amusing if the idea didn't creep me out."
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,SpastixFantastix,2,Sun Nov 30 00:37:09 2014 UTC,"Well, I guess I'll have to keep a close eye on him then 0_0 Though even if K is an alien, I won't look at him less that I do now. Knowing him, he's a pretty cool dude, always smiling and cracking jokes, all-in-all a really fun guy to hang out with, hehe."
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,dankusama,4,Sun Nov 30 02:46:25 2014 UTC,"the way I see it, if they've known each other this long and he hasn't yet dissected her or tried to eat her, she's probably good.  Actually, if I were to find out some of my friends were aliens, I would not be surprised in the least."
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,CrushedNewt,5,Sun Nov 30 20:30:53 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure not all extra-terrestrials are interested in conquering or dissecting humans. For all we know, a lot of them may actually just enjoy having a vacation here and their cloaking devices are so they could blend in."

Humanoidencounters,2njacb,cashan0va_007,1 point,Mon Dec 1 00:02:52 2014 UTC,Hahahaha! xD
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,sniggity,8,Mon Dec 1 07:19:06 2014 UTC,"My guess would be that the ""X"" strap you described would be the source of the creatures cloaking device. Although, I gotta say, it's not a very good one if all it can do is mimic silhouettes of people but it could've just been on the fritz.   He probably just wanted to see some Earth women, or maybe he actually had a job to do and just got distracted. Although, I haven't heard of these types of creatures to be attracted to humans at all so that's new to me but, hey, there's nothing telling them not to be, that I'm aware of anyway."
Humanoidencounters,2njacb,dankusama,2,Fri Nov 28 06:04:45 2014 UTC,"I did thought it was on a mission, perhaps to study human behavior and whatever it is aliens need to learn/know about us more. Also, I have read reports where aliens do get attracted to women. In fact, there's a report posted here a few days ago where model Christy Moeller was attacked by a weird entity.  I personally believe the cloaking device had a fuck up at the time, which may explain the static silhouette and the revelation of its true form. This could be backed further by the creature's reaction when O screamed, making a face as if to say ""Well, fuck"" and retreated immediately."

Humanoidencounters,2mwkp2,sniggity,4,Thu Nov 20 19:35:55 2014 UTC,"This may be a sighting of the ""bell"" shaped object so often talked about in post-world war 2 black operations, which Von Braun was working on for the Nazi party.

Humanoidencounters,2mwkp2,cashan0va_007,3,Sun Nov 23 20:48:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it would be hard to speculate. But there isn't a shadow of a doubt that we have, at the very least, reverse engineered some sort of extraterrestrial space craft within the past 60 years. I've even read articles and interviews with ""former Area 51 employees"" that state, and I quote, ""if you can dream of it, scientists at Area 51 have either already worked on it or are working on it now"".

My ex girlfriend who I was with for 4 years was exceptionally pretty, people would often stare at her without realizing they were.

Humanoidencounters,2mql08,CrushedNewt,2,Wed Nov 19 22:12:53 2014 UTC,"Yes, a sketch would be awesome. Great story! Did you mention the guy to anyone else who was there at the time?"
Humanoidencounters,2mpv46,EtheB,6,Wed Nov 19 00:00:25 2014 UTC,"Hmm... This is very interesting and if you'd like I could try to help you figure it out. I do a lot of research about stuff like this and is the main reason why I subscribed to this subreddit. So if you don't mind someone asking a lot of questions about this I would be glad to help.  Now, I've never heard of anything like this in any way so it could be some new phenomena that no one has come across yet. At first, I thought that it could be related to the cases of ""Black-eyed Children"" but your description of the face doesn't seem to coincide with them at all, especially that bit at the end about him disappearing but it is still very interesting."
Humanoidencounters,2mpv46,CrushedNewt,4,Wed Nov 19 03:01:20 2014 UTC,I can answer any questions you need if you think you might be able to crack this a little bit. This is seriously one of the greatest mysteries I've ever encountered and it's plagued me since it happened.
Humanoidencounters,2mpv46,CrushedNewt,5,Wed Nov 19 16:01:01 2014 UTC,"Ok, so did the guy stop before he vanished into thin air or did he continue to walk forward as he was disappearing? I ask because if it's the later than that would imply that whatever it is has the ability to turn invisible to some degree.  Also, since you saw his face, do you remember what his eyes looked like? Were they black or did they look normal?  I find your description of his face very interesting. The way his face was smeared, as you say, makes me think that it was makeup of some kind or otherwise a mask. The look of shock implies that he wasn't expecting anyone to see him. All in all, this makes me think that whatever he is, or was, it's like he's trying to mix in with normal people but, obviously, that night he failed."
Humanoidencounters,2mpv46,CrushedNewt,8,Wed Nov 19 18:03:27 2014 UTC,"I'll edit the post with this part later but I'll just answer now.  He was running very fast away from us and as he was he never faded like an apparition does.  His body stayed solid the whole time but he sort of dissipated from the feet up like he started turning to sand and it was falling away, so at one point he was just half a solid body in the air...if that makes sense?  And I couldn't really tell color of eye. The way his face was ""smeared"" it was just two dark blears where his eyes would be.  And his face was smeared past where his physical face would end. His mouth was gaping sort of like the people who were killed in The Ring. Oh hell, I'm going to work on a sketch and see if maybe I can't come up with a close representation.  I can see it so clearly in my head, it's just so hard to describe."
Humanoidencounters,2mpv46,sniggity,4,Wed Nov 19 21:50:02 2014 UTC,Hmm... Very interesting. The way the thing disappeared is very perplexing. I can't really think of anything that could've caused it to do that sort of thing. I would love to see that sketch of yours whenever you're able to post it.

Haha. She said that the little kids would cry and then she would have to tell them a happy story because she felt so bad for doing it. She said by the time she stopped teaching, she had the largest class her church has ever seen because the kids loved her and her stories.

Humanoidencounters,2ipy2s,sniggity,2,Thu Oct 9 01:48:51 2014 UTC,This sounds very much like the Mothman. How old is this encounter? If it's after the silver bridge collapse it could have relocated to Russia if accurate.

Humanoidencounters,2ipy2s,Zi7,1 point,Tue Oct 28 16:36:53 2014 UTC,"I personally feel like it relocates. There were so many sightings in West Virginia. It chased a couple as they were driving, it would watch people through their windows at night, and it was often seen near an old munitions plant. Witnesses felt that it was trying to communicate. Suddenly all encounters ceased after the silver bridge broke apart. This winged entity could possibly be very old, perhaps different cultures had different names for it.   Great sub by the way:D, I'd often search for humanoid encounters and absolutely love the encounters, but they're so hard to find at times. I read many to believe that there seems to be white coloured entities that are either really tall, on four legs, or have other unnatural traits.

I'm amazed actually.  The only difference was that she was around 17-ish with 3 other friends on a beach in Malibu, California (maybe a little northerly) around 11pm at night.  Her friend saw it as well, and she won't speak about it to this day, and there were two boys there that were split from their group at the time of the sighting.  She described cold blue eyes.  She said it got really close to her and they locked eyes.  It was the same description though.  She calls him/it ""birdman"".  She said he had the face of an old man, wings that covered its body, and hook nose or beak (she was awed or confused by it).  Completely accurate of this description I read above, except the eyes.  I went online just an hour ago to research this for her.  I'm amazed that the first article I've read is so accurate of a match to her story.  Having read this I just really wanted to share her story, because it sounds so crazy at first to hear what she said.  But now, it seems real!    Oh and an important note!  She didn't necessarily feel as if it was a ""scary"" creature or evil in anyway.  But, obviously,  the way it looked could be quite startling in the dark.  Thanks.

See they were on the beach with the ocean behind, and they were facing a cliff that they first saw it on standing on or floating above.  After it was gazing closely at her.  She said it just flew off behind her over the ocean.  I think we might have to make a thread.  She can add some of the details I can't.  This was in the 70's I think."

To this day it remains a case in which all the facts involved support the witnesses claims and it is this kind of case that makes the ufo phenomenon such an enduring mystery. Lonnie Zamora saw a highly unusual device of unknown origin, what can only be described as a ""craft"" of some kind, and he reported seeing what he believes were occupants.

Humanoidencounters,2fkkwq,KirriLidian,1 point,Sat Sep 6 03:07:54 2014 UTC,"Sure thing. Not much is involved right now, because it's so slow there, but once it picks up you will have to approve certain posts, eliminate certain troublemakers, and basically just make sure everyone is on good behavior."
Humanoidencounters,2fkkwq,KirriLidian,2,Sat Sep 6 17:15:53 2014 UTC,ok cool.
Humanoidencounters,2fkkwq,sniggity,2,Sat Sep 6 21:25:07 2014 UTC,Thats kinda sad :(
Humanoidencounters,2fkkwq,adriennevalhalla,4,Sun Sep 7 08:55:13 2014 UTC,"Well, perhaps. Perhaps they were afraid and decided to just shoot first. But this happened after a strange human mutilation case also in Brazil, so they may have had very good reason to be afraid. The link below is NSFW and NSFL, the pictures are very graphic, but they are all the way at the bottom of the page. Some visitors may be benevolent, but imo this shows some are truly monsters.  http://www.reocities.com/aliengrip/Mutilations/Guarapiranga2-En.htm  [edit: the autopsy showed this poor man was ALIVE when he was dissected.]"
Humanoidencounters,2fkedz,sniggity,2,Fri Sep 5 17:28:02 2014 UTC,It sounds like a turkey vulture. Those things grow disturbingly large and ugly around here.
Humanoidencounters,2fkedz,Droog_7,2,Mon Sep 8 17:31:55 2014 UTC,"Could be, I'd love to see some pictures though.."
Humanoidencounters,2fkedz,Droog_7,2,Mon Sep 8 17:39:15 2014 UTC,"I wish I had my phone out the day I drove too close to one eating it's roadkill. The thing dive bombed me. It was so big, its wingspan filled the windshield of my SUV.   Is this your sub? It's great! Lots of high strangeness. Just subscribed twenty minutes ago."
Humanoidencounters,2fkedz,Droog_7,2,Mon Sep 8 17:46:33 2014 UTC,"Yup, it's my sub. Thanks for subscribing, if you don't mind, can you help spread the word about us?  I've always loved stuff like this, bigfoot, alien abductions, weird cryptoid encounters have always fascinated me, so I decided to make a sub for the reports out there.  Hey, if you're into this kind of thing and really enjoy it, I'm going to be looking for moderators once this place gets a little larger. There's not much going on here now, but once it grows we will be needing more watchmen. Lol you interested?"
Humanoidencounters,2fkedz,Droog_7,2,Mon Sep 8 18:52:07 2014 UTC,"This would be a great sub to moderate, but I can't. I've finally cracked my own dream of writing in the paranormal field and been hired by a client to write a book. But I think you're steering this sub in the right direction with cases that aren't easily explained. It's good!"
Humanoidencounters,2fkedz,Droog_7,1 point,Mon Sep 8 19:12:23 2014 UTC,"No problem, what area of the paranormal is the book about?  I'm very versed on all areas of the paranormal lol."
Humanoidencounters,2fkfrs,sniggity,1 point,Fri Sep 5 17:40:55 2014 UTC,Fascinating!!

Humanoidencounters,2e7ll8,sniggity,10,Thu Aug 21 19:58:43 2014 UTC,Why is the title about France when it isn't mentioned once in the article?
Humanoidencounters,2e7ll8,PerpetualPuffing,13,Mon Dec 1 10:12:42 2014 UTC,"""The Coneheads"" were a Saturday Night Live sketch about obvious aliens who try to pass as normal Americans, claiming in squeaky toneless voices that they are from France to explain their oddness.  Incidentally, the Coneheads movie soundtrack had a (glorious) version of ""Fight the Power"" performed by the Barenaked Ladies.  That same group has a well-known song called ... Brian Wilson  (the same name as the pizza guy in OP's story.)  COINCIDENCE? YOU BE THE JUDGE"

Humanoidencounters,2aut6c,randomstudman,3,Wed Jul 16 13:17:48 2014 UTC,"A month late to the party, I know. But what you describe sounds a lot like the black stick man creature. Usually they're seen at dawn and dusk. I went and dug up a quick link that describes them a little Black Stick Men  These guys are a pretty fascinating phenomenon."
Humanoidencounters,2aut6c,ZyklonDee,1 point,Mon Aug 18 04:49:18 2014 UTC,"I've always been fascinated by them myself.  Weird stuff going on! Thanks for stopping by, help me spread the word about this place !"

Humanoidencounters,2aut6c,sniggity,2,Wed Jul 16 13:18:58 2014 UTC,"I think this thing may have been some sort of trans-dimensional entity. I also definitely feel it could have some foresight or maybe even control over future events since the accident happened where you saw it. Coincidence? I think not. Thanks so much for sharing, and since this is still a new and growing subreddit, please let your friends know about this subreddit."
Humanoidencounters,2asot0,sniggity,2,Tue Jul 15 20:49:38 2014 UTC,"We got a lot of mafia over in those parts due to Atlantic City.  Also Egg Harbor has swampy areas, good for disposing someone. Sorry. but my money is on la familia."
Humanoidencounters,2asot0,owwmyass,1 point,Wed Jul 16 09:08:02 2014 UTC,Good possibility. People want to think they're no longer active.  Pffff...yeah right !
