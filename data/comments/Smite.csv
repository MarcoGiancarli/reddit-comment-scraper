To elaborate once fixed:  If you roll Kali Skaliwag in the chest, you will be rewarded any of the 4 collection bonus items that you qualify for from obtaining the Skin.  You WILL NOT get a Summer of Smite event Chest as you did not purchase the skin directly.  NOTE: If you roll Kali Skaliwag now, then purchase ANOTHER Summer of Smite item, it will fix up your rewards and grant you anything you were supposed to earn.  We are also looking into getting everyone who has missed a reward due to rolling Kali Skaliwag fixed up, not sure on the ETA."

With the revelation of kali's true passive it's seen as even better, and  the current build for Kali with exe and titans. But as exe applies it's pen before the percentage pen from kali's passive and titans isn't this actually a detriment, with the enemy needing to have over 104 physical protection for it to be the equal of just buying brawlers. They also have to have over 156 protections for kali's passive to be better as % if she has exe than if it had been flat which will only be warriors and guardians in a meta where we're seeing less bruiser and more hunters/mage/assasins in the solo.   So what I'm asking is, is my maths right and what was thought of as a buff is actually a nerf to kali. (it's always been the case I realize)"

Smite,3e2miy,NeedsMoreSharks,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"Triple crit is monsterous damage,   Late game Ichavial loses it's purpose as you mostly finish the fights in 3-4 hits or get 2 hitted by an assasin like Loki.  Early and Mid - Ichaival is great as the damage output is lower and the effects of the item work over longer perioid of time, effectively making enemy need more hits to kill you than you to kill him. Late - boxing matches rarely happen (there are mostly teamfights) and even if they do, it's usually a matter of a root/stun and 3-4 shots.

He's a whatever-the-fuck-you-want-him-to-be warrior, capable of building pure tank, AA damage, OR ability damage, depending on team comp and play style. slows stack, so you can slow someone with Chaac's 3 AND frostbound to make your enemies either have to dash or try to crawl away. Frostbound also slows enemy attack speed, which Chaac's 3 hasn't done for a very long time. Building frostbound in general is good because 400 HP is OP and warriors lack a lot of CC, so the additional slow is nice. I personally dont build FB on Guan Yu, but I can see the appeal of throwing a single auto between abilities to stick to someone forever and allow your ADC to keep smacking the enemy in the face"

Smite,3e2miy,Given_Fear,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"Spear is also % pen. It's much ""better"" because:   besides small penetration base, it has reduction on passive rather than pure pen. allowing you to help your magical allies deal damage. besides % it has a flat pen too, which works much better on squishier characters it has same tendency as Titan's Bane vs The Executioner. Enemy needs to have a very high magical defence for Obsydian to actually penetrate more than Spear of Magus does.   As much as I compared those items to Titan's vs Exec, it's not really true - Exec stacks are much easier to get than Spear of Magus'. You got unlimited amount of fast basic attacks, while there is CD on your abilities, and not all of them are easy to hit or even damage people. So you can't say right away Spear of Magus is always better. This depends on the god you play."

I use her in solo, and basically starting trying to keep my passive up at all times, to the point of not last hitting minions and using two abilities to clear the wave. If our team is really ahead, I'll get blink 2, if not, I'll just go in. My focus is basically bursting down enemies early game and setting up late game, and backdoor is nice to. If I run in, I'll basic, her 2, basic, her 3 for stun, and then basics and her one to try and finish them. If I have blink 2, then I'll minions before the basic in order to get the protections debuff (also see below). This is fairly standard Nu Wa (I think?).  Where it gets weird is the build, and the leveling. I'll go 3-1-2 to start, as usual, but then I'll go 3-2-3-2-3-2-2-3-4, to maximize my early game kill potential with higher damage and stun time. I'll level the ult earlier if I feel unsafe. I rarely use my ult for damage, only focusing on the vision to help backdoors and lategame in the case of enemies missing when I think we could be in danger.  For the build, I start with boots 2, 3 health pots and 3 mixed pots (because solo, I have mana buff), and then finish my pen boots first. After that, I rush Gem of Iso (more early game kill potential, adding on to the root into stun combo), and finish my core with the big weird one, Polynomicon, because of my increased reliance on basic attacks, hence trying to use minions first if possible. Then I go into Obsidian shard, and than either Fatalis for chase, or Soul Reaver for securing kills. Obviously ending with Rod of Tahuti, as per usual. Beads is the other active, or Aegis Pendant if they don't have notable CC (rare).  This play style seems to wreck the early game, is better at ganking, but falls off somewhat lategame. I've only started trying it out recently and haven't seen it used by anyone else. Is there any potential with playing like this, using her in solo, and building the way I am?"
Smite,3e2miy,jodaewon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"Unless you plan on split pushing a lot, spear or demonic will give more pen than obsidian, especially since your minions have protection shredding built in & you don't use your ult for damage.

My idea is that since her scalings are so low and she has HP removal, damage reflection, and two slows, and a very sizable protections debuff, she can work as a frontline bruiser who locks targets down for the ADC/mages to kill.

Imagine placing Khepri's ult on your ADC and have them actually revive stronger than they were when they died. Curious to see how this unfolds.

Smite,3e2awq,AngelsOnBikes,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"While this is absolutely a valid point, I think the only reason it may be more of an issue on Smite, is because of the several years of history on PC. I'm sure there are players who were ""fringe-pros"" on PC because of the higher talent-level who can/have moved to Xbox where their experience is a huge boon. Those people would have several years of M/KB, so I could see them doing that.  But yeah, good point on other games that would have the same option."
Smite,3e2awq,Sauceman87,0,Tue Jul 21 16:14:20 2015 UTC,Assuming you can make it into LAN given the inability for most players to make it into the Masters scene vs. the KB/M players.
Smite,3e2awq,Hell_Shoot,6,Tue Jul 21 13:02:58 2015 UTC,You don't need to be in Masters to play Professionally.  Take a look at Xaelia for instance:   He's the solo laner for Paradigm; He's considered to be the best or one of the best in his role; He doesn't play League/Ranked.   Why would you fake your qualifiers with KB/M when you're going to play on a controller on LAN?! It'll just make you lose big time on LAN.
Smite,3e2awq,-MooGi-,5,Tue Jul 21 13:13:04 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I concede my argument.

Smite,3dyjog,Theguyofone,15,Mon Jul 20 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"As humorous as these things are, does anybody actually find the current damage levels in smite to be a good thing?  Dying to 1-3 hits in the span of a split second is the norm, and even fully built tanks can explode in moments with a few crits.  There are obvious paths for counterplay (aegis, SotU, avoidance abilities, etc), and doing something like cutting all damage in half has notable side effects such as making healers more effective, but in my opinion the game would be more fun if it wasn't possible to die in the span of a single knockup.  The addition of lane wide/global aoe spells that apply hard/soft cc and do massive damage is another concern since one of the features I personally liked about smite was actually having to aim things, but I guess I'm in the minority here."
Smite,3dyjog,Isolate-,6,Mon Jul 20 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"It isn't really that much different in other mobas. In league you can get 100-0'd in less than 0,5 seconds by a LeBlanc, Lux laser, Rengar stealth combo, etc."
Smite,3dyjog,Ergarr,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"I legit thought you were taking about Matt Leblanc, sorry I'll leave now"
Smite,3dyjog,Kookie_Face,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:15 2015 UTC,"Certainly, which is why I never made that particular argument.  This is a common problem, even games like WoW arena go through shifts in the meta where changes in the numbers favor burst or healing.  Taking it to extremes, if a team decides to unload all 5 of their damage ultimates and focus on a single target that has no counter available (aegis or other damage redux), then it should be expected to die.  The problem is, smite currently does not require anywhere near that level of commitment.  Late game, if you get hit by say a Bacchus knock up, there is a good chance you could be dead before you even land if there is a hunter that crits two basic attacks (which is not uncommon).  This can be solved with more counterplay options (active dodge abilities like Chang'e, periods of reduced damage, etc).  My point is that overall I think damage is currently too much in smite.  I also think CC is out of control as well but that is a different argument."
Smite,3dyjog,Isolate-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"That's why Shell is so frequently used in competitive. If Bacchus knocks up the ADC, the only hope that they survive rests on someone using Shell and possibly getting into position to block autos."
Smite,3dyjog,thesandbar2,9,Mon Jul 20 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I understand late game means more damage but there shouldn't be so much damage that a single freeze gets you killed (in under 3s). Like a Serqet hitting you with her [2] - which is basically a taunt - and killing you before it ends; no chance unless beads is up.  That's just not fun. I like slightly longer fights to allow more counterplay, instead of whoever can CC the enemy and blow them up first. This is why I sometimes like mid game more.   Burst damage makes CC more op and CC makes burst damage more op"
Smite,3dyjog,thekream,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"the fact that you can be CC locked and fucked without even having the chance to react is kinda depressing. Displacement is a thing that we all should avoid, but sometimes it is inevitable (specially with gods that bring some kind of displacement CC to the table, like Sobek or Serqet) and its not aways that your C. Blink, Aegis, Beads or your escape ability that will be up. And then it will be the moment you will wish your enemies would step on lego."
Smite,3dyjog,RemnantVenomtail,3,Mon Jul 20 20:01:22 2015 UTC,"I have more trouble with Sylvanus pull into whole team lategame than Sobek or Serqet, or even Athena."
Smite,3dyjog,TheCanadianGoat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you don't even have the ability to react. There's only two ways of escaping CC and those can only occur once every ninety seconds. When there can be as many as three to seven hard CCs on the enemy team you're bound to reach a point where it's not a choice whether or not you die, but instead of HOW you'll die."
Smite,3dyjog,DrSoaryn,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being downvoted, you're pretty spot on.   Magi's got nerfed HARD, lowering it to 90s instead of 60s Aegis has a 90s CD at max rank Beads has a 90s CD at max rank   Your only options now are hope that your team CC's the big damage dealers as you get CC'd, shell gets popped, or some form of mitigation/healing procs on you before the CC ends.  The big issue stems from every man and their dog having at least one form of CC in their kit. In the grand scheme, it should only really be the support type gods that are heavily CC oriented, but we have gods like Serqet appearing which are just CC incarnate."

Smite,3dyjog,ogva_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:56:14 2015 UTC,"My concern with the damage levels being lowered is 1) healers would be disproportionately powerful 2) Warriors and Guardians would be far to hard to kill and 3) gods with escapes + beads would be far to hard to lock down and kill (rata and serqet are already tough to take down), games would go on forever with fights never resulting in more than 1/2 people being killed.  I understand it is frustrating being hit by a whirlpool and Kraken and going from 100-0 but good positioning, awareness and itemisation means this is not inevitable. My opinion is if players are good enough, and team play is on point, then it is OK to be Geb stunned into Zeus ult, into auto attack death. It might be that you die in no time, but pulling that all off requires fairly decent play all round, and IMO in a game like this if you take 2-3 big damage or big CC ults in the face, that should be death, unless you can beads your way to victory."
Smite,3dyjog,TurboFrog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:20 2015 UTC,I wish this game would slow down
Smite,3dyjog,puffer567,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:20 2015 UTC,"Been playing on pc and xbox and I agree entirely (full disclosure, I am new and kinda suck). Xbox is much more fun for me because people haven't all figured out how to stack damage yet so battles are more engaging and less ""OMFG WHAT JUST HAPPENED??!!"" When you bring out all the items and stacked damage ults, encounters start feeling much more random and you lose accessible strategic team play (being able to play with your friends, not just people who have mastered all the mechanics). If the same progression goes on on the xbox that has on the PC, the game will become increasingly less friend-friendly and the population will go down significantly, while the community gets more hostile and elitist - I mean, that will happen no matter what, because video games, but the slower/less it does I think the better for everyone. :)  I'm not entirely sure what the answer is in SMITE because making that damage change would arguably be bad for the pros who can actually process and respond fast enough that it's not random feeling. That pro market is definitely a big thing for SMITE and high damage lightning reflex gameplay has a place. But playing the casual list on PC I can see how there's massive gaps between people who are sharp, those who aren't, and those who just play to overpowered OHKs to make up for lack of skill. Definitely sucks out the fun.  And whatever is in the other MOBAs really doesn't matter, since the other MOBAs play different. In SMITE you want to be able to spend time fighting what's in front of you, not just the map and watching for/making ganks - otherwise you wouldn't be playing a third person MOBA to start with... right? Maybe that's just me :)"
Smite,3dyjog,devoltar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"I think CC is a bigger problem than the damage. There aren't enough ways to effectively mitigate it. There's a handful of god skills, a couple items, and beads, beads being the most common.   The cooldown on beads is insane, it's definitely helpful when it's up but if you've ever played Arena against an Ares, you know it's never up. There are so many team comps that if you are up against them, you can't do anything but forcefully stand in place while they nuke the shit out of you. I would really like the ability to dodge or block cc, even a quicktime event where I can press the corresponding button at the right time for a chance to evade the cc would be a huge improvement."

Smite,3dyjog,RustyBrownsRingDonut,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think the damage is a problem, the randomness is. So many things are unpredictable and can make you lose a game easily, or die without reason. Janus ult is a prime example for that. A Scylla following up with her combo after a successful freeze and killing me with it - oh well, that's what that god does, isn't it? The same could have happend to her. It's a lot more predictable, has big targeters and needs setup. While a random Janus ult can just fuck you with a bit bad luck."

Smite,3dyx1s,Abbx,45,Mon Jul 20 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I mean it really is. Recently, the friend that I typically play Smite with has been busy so I haven't gotten to play with him for a while. Every time I load up the game, I just look at conquest, because I really like conquest even though we usually play arena, and just really can't bring myself to queue it. Conquest more than any other game mode is likely to end with everybody pissed at each other whether that be warranted or not. Everyone just starts acting like assholes and all it does is bring everyone's ability to play properly down and nobody ever realizes they just all need to shut up and play the game.   Something that infuriates me the most about a lot of conquest players is that a lot of them will get so hostile over your build if it's not what the pros build. But when you want to play something off meta, say Ao Kuang solo (which isn't really meta so much as cyclone is god of solo lane), people are not having it. So you HAVE to build like the pros, but in no way, shape, or form are you allowed to play a non-traditional character for a role like some of the pros do. It's infuriating."
Smite,3dyx1s,PantsMcDancey,66,Mon Jul 20 17:52:16 2015 UTC,For me Conquest is like dating. It's like I really want to do it and I'm sure it could be great but it's such a commitment and the whole time I'm on edge knowing that if I slip up once that could be the end.  So I just queue up arena instead. It's more like a bar.
Smite,3dyx1s,jdog90000,16,Mon Jul 20 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"This sums it up quite well, actually. Personally, I play any mode but conquest. Seriously. For me, a game of Siege and a game of Joust fills the Conquest void personally. Granted, this is coming from someone who plays Arena 76% of the time."

Smite,3dyx1s,Ayotte,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:12 2015 UTC,"At least for me it doesn't really have an effect on me. I go about my day perfectly fine, I'm not gonna sit there bawling my eyes out for the rest of the day because some guy said something mean to me in a game. But still, dealing with people being complete assholes is never going to be a fun experience. Even if I'm not involved and it's just teammates arguing it still annoys me to no end. It's a team game yet nobody ever plays like a team. And when nobody plays like a team that results in a lower chance of us winning which is kind of a problem for me.   And I definitely believe Smite has become more toxic than LoL. One of my friends who plays a lot of LoL made it to platinum and told me that it got pretty bad at that rank because almost every time as soon as one person fucks up someone starts a surrender vote and afks if it doesn't pass.... and that's exactly Smite ranked from the very goddamn beginning. Obviously there are some differences between Smite and LoL that play into this like how Smite actively shows the gold difference so people are getting discouraged once they get down by a little bit. Beside the point, in both casual and ranked Conquest is just a trashfest and very rarely do I have a productive and constructive team. If it happened every once in a while it might not be a big deal but when nearly every single consecutive game is constant bickering at a point it's hard to justify having fun with it.  And I know there's always the ""well get thicker skin"" argument. And while that'd be one way to solve the problem... it'd also be nice if being a shit-talking asshat will actually result in punishment. When people BM me I BM the fuck out of them back because as of right now, there's about a 0% chance I'll get banned for whatever i say and that's exactly the problem."
Smite,3dyx1s,pwntpants,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"Probably going to get down voted to the next century but. I would like to put another perspective on ""having to play and build like the pros"". I have something like +5,000 games played spread out in all the modes, a bit over 2,000 are in conquest by itself. and most of the time When someone dose a weird pick or an unconventional pick they get shit on horribly and then say something along the lines of ""hey man I was testing it out"" almost as if they where using it as an excuse for practically trolling and throwing a game.   TL:DR I and I think many people don't care if you go unconventional picks, but don't pick it unless you actually have a clue about what you are doing. don't just pick it and then if and when you lose say ""i was experimenting"" as an excuse to losing."

Smite,3dyx1s,BMXPoet,9,Tue Jul 21 01:46:59 2015 UTC,Yeah. Because the bots are a perfect analog for a human player.

Smite,3dyx1s,BMXPoet,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:38 2015 UTC,normal conquest is where you should be able to test things. Ranked is where it should be locked down and you know what you are doing. Experimenting does not mean you should just give up if it fails. Play until you lose rather than play till you surrender.    IMO Bots is for testing numbers. Norm Conquest is for experimenting and testing strategies. Ranked is for serious play.
Smite,3dyx1s,GloriousToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on this. I'm currently going through various gods as unconventional supports - Ne Zha, Nox, Rat and various others. I've had relatively good responses when stating it in pre-lobby and justifying my picks with good theory-crafting. From what I can tell, a refreshing, well thought-out attempt at something in casual is great, but not so much in ranked...although I will likely end up using the unconventionals in ranked at some point."
Smite,3dyx1s,darkkai3,3,Tue Jul 21 14:30:14 2015 UTC,"The bots may as well not even be there, not a substitute for even the dumbest human players even.  The only way to test if stuff is viable in a real match is to use it in a real match."

Nothing seems to work for some people, they are just going to play shit regardless how you talk to them, I dont get angry at people any more though I just get pissed off that some one who does not buy beads against and Ares some how ends up in my game, Ill still tell people when they are doing stupid stuff to stop though but they hardly listen and instead ask what league I am in ranked, like that matters when your playing arena..."

While I'm am just a noob. Please rain your divine wisdom down on me in the form of verbal harrassment. The sewage spewing out of your keyboard satiates me and I thank you for all the value you produce for free and without anyone asking you for it. Truly a selfless and noble act, you model human being you.   The constant f6ing gets to me too. I know there is a time and a place but if you f6 every game you think you might lose you're doing it wrong. This isn't a race to the top of the leaderboards goddamn it. A lot of us just want to play for an hour or two and not have to re-queue every time you play against someone better than you. If you have all your players and none of them are trolling there is no reason to f6 arena with a 20 ticket deficit.  It's a game, someone has to lose. Grow the fuck up."

Smite,3dyx1s,ChaoticRyu,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:47:57 2015 UTC,"The thing is, people play casuals as training for ranked. Grind some masteries and getting familiar with the god in lane or jungle.

Mute the BM'ers and focus on you and you alone  It's just natural territory for moba's...when your own performance relies so heavily on that of your own team mates, it can get frustrating trying to fight people with exponential gold and experience advantages, and there are always going to be people that take these frustrations out. Combine that with the fact you're never going to have to experience or deal with the person you're flaming ever again, and the fact there are next to no consequences for BM'ing, you have the situation like in every single moba game..."

Dota actually has effective reporting tools that will tell you if action is taken (although it won't tell you who in particular was punished.) The people that we're playing with are actually making a choice to be assholes because they can be. Hirez could be doing more to combat toxicity and toxicity isn't something that should just be accepted.

Most of the time, I won't even queue conquest without at least one other person. People have this notion to base your overall skill as a player off of one game. There's been times where I'd carry 3-4 games in a row and then just have a horribly off game where I'm missing autos, missing abilities, and just straight up being outplayed. And it's that one game where I get BMd by pretty much everyone on the team lol. It's gotten to the point where I just mute people before the match starts and just do my thing. Win or lose.

Part of the reason we see such poor behavior is because the community KNOWS that nothing is being done so they feel like they can get away with stuff.

I have about 500-ish conquest matches under my belt (not many compared to most, but enough to establish a pattern) and I'm Plat 3 (not that it means much).  And I know for a fact I've had at least 10% of my games end up with someone flaming another person.  And about half of the time I'm the target.  I can guarantee that after a handful of conquest matches I'll probably get flamed or if I'm playing with someone they will because one of us had a bad game."
Smite,3dyx1s,Unimarobj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:42 2015 UTC,"I went under my profile in game and can't seem to find anywhere that gives me the number of games played (I was wrong though, it's actually 54% total for conquest...used to play a looot of joust when it was still 1v1).  On the main site (smitegame.com) I can't seem to find anything either, other than my number of matches won is 1240.  I do know my W/L ratio is very very close to 50% so probably ~2500.  I've seen plenty of BM, especially in 3v3.  But nothing nearly as severe as what OP is describing by far."
Smite,3dyx1s,Wemms0r,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:39 2015 UTC,"I think we need to differenciate between casuals and league here.  I'm fine with people trying weird stuff in casuals and won't bm them if they do bad.  However if people queue for ranked and then don't even know how to build the god they're playing, you're just asking to get flamed. Seriously if you're not even willing to put a minimum of effort into the game, which doesn't even require any skill or learning, then your should not be playing that games most competitive game mode and stick to casuals.  There are actually people that put time and effort into finding the best builds and theorycrafting in general. And casual players that ""just want to try out league"" make league the same as casual conquest with bans.  There is literally no difference between league and casuals up to the upper gold tiers. This cannot be the intention behind a gamemode that claims to be made for the competitive part of the player base."
Smite,3dyx1s,theseehawk,18,Mon Jul 20 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"However if people queue for ranked and then don't even know how to build the god they're playing, you're just asking to get flamed   This kind of thinking is what gives MOBAs a bad rap.  Why does anybody have to get flamed?  Why does anybody think they, specifically, get to make the call of who gets flamed and who doesn't?  Why does anybody who plays poorly at a game deserve to be yelled at and cursed at?  Nobody ""asks to get flamed"" unless they are trolling and purposely trying to F-up the game for everybody and piss people off.  And if you're actually unlucky enough to have one of these in your game, flaming them is just giving them what they want.  There are two kinds of people who play; those that don't give a shit and are not trying and those that do give a shit and are trying. Flaming the first kind doesn't solve anything because they don't give a shit. Flaming the second kind can turn a future good player, an asset to the game and community, completely off.  There is never a reason to flame.  (btw this isn't directed at Wemms0r personally of specifically, I have no idea what kind of player he is and have no reason to think he flames indiscriminately or anything, it's just that his comment represented something I thought should be addressed)"
Smite,3dyx1s,Wemms0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"You did not understand one thing i said. I was talking about ranked, which is a gamemode for people willing to put a little more time and effort into this game than casual players. If you are not willing to put in this ""more effort"" you will perform poorly and therefore ruin other peoples games because they cannot rely on you the same way they could rely on a better player that put that time and effort in.  So basically if you're too lazy to even look up a build and save it into your god builder, you should NOT play ranked. And if you do people have all the right to be mad at you.  Or do you think anyone would voluntarily let a player, that is obviously much worse than the rest of the team, play on a basketball team if the game ment ANYTHING and it wasn't purely for fun?"
Smite,3dyx1s,theseehawk,2,Tue Jul 21 08:02:17 2015 UTC,"You did not understand one thing i said. I was talking about ranked,   I know you were talking about ranked.  I was talking about flaming.  My point is/was that we are (for the most part) adults playing a game.  Why would one adult ever think that screaming, cursing and threatening another adult about how poorly they play a game is acceptable public behavior?  To use your analogy; if I joined a pickup basketball game and somebody on my team started screaming and cursing at me because my game didn't live up to his expectations I would A) knock him out if he was smaller than me, and/or B) not play at that park again.  It's easy to be an internet tough-guy when option A isn't really an option so what happens more is option B which is what I was talking about.  Potentially good players being turned off the game because of an abusive sector of the community.  I also know you were talking about ranked instead of strictly casual, but IMHO the same holds true.  It's still a public match-making forum and we're all still adults playing a game.  The fact that it ""means more"" to you doesn't give you the right to scream and curse at people.  To continue your sports analogy, I played college football.  It certainly meant a lot to me an all my team mates.  But if I had a bad game and one of my teammates tried to scream & curse & carry one like some of the BM'ers you hear on Smite not only would I not have it but the rest of the team wouldn't have it either because it's a team of peers and the weakest link to a team isn't always the worst player, sometimes it's the player with the worst attitude.  Now if my coach wanted to chew me out that's another matter.  He's the coach, I'm the player.  He's not my peer he's my superior and that's part of the problem in the Smite community, people think they are other's superiors because they're good at a game.  You're not.  You may be better at the game, and you may know more than me, but you're not my boss, coach, wife or teacher.  You don't get to yell and scream at me -EVER-.  It's not acceptable behavior and I'm constantly at a loss as to why people sometimes try to defend it.  One caveat is that everything above is based on the assumption that I'm talking to, and about, adults.  Kids are kids.  They are egocentric, lack empathy and resort to volume over logic.  I don't say this to be insulting to minors, I actually say this to defend their crappy behavior.  Expecting a 13 year old to act like an adult will do nothing but frustrate you and the 13 year old.  But I don't think it's unreasonable to expect more mature players to act....well....more mature.  Why would anybody disagree with this?"

It only happens when I am trying out a new God too.   On one hand, people are crazy trolls. On the other hand, a game of Smite is a big commitment. You can't back out of it and start a new game. You are locked in and stuck with these people for 20-30 minutes. So if one is clearly fucking up its going to grate on you for the full 20-30 minutes. So I can understand the rage, but its still funny as fuck.   When people rage on me now in messages I pretend to cry and ask them why they are picking on me and try and make them feel like total shit. They usually stop messaging LOL. I also report, because its funny trolling the trolls."

Smite,3dyx1s,ArtillerySr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"Many of the reasons get upset in conquest is because decision making is crucial and most casual players have little to no ability to make sound decisions in game.

IMO the only way you're gonna have fun in these games when you're trying to learn is to cut all communication with everyone.  which is ridiculous to have to do in a game that is supposed to be team oriented and require communication.  But TBH it's really the only way to have any type of fun in this game so if someone decides to mute every single team mate right off the bat, the community only has themselves to thank for it."

But at some point I truly stopped caring. Even though I'm a casual player (I don't play ranked conquest) but I do believe that conquest is the the most interesting mode. I wouldn't feel comfortable telling people I'm good at Smite if I wouldn't play conquest so one day I got over my fear and queued. Sometimes you do good and sometimes you for bad but what's very important to remember is that there is that mute button, it saved my life more then once. I know it mutes voice commands as well but it's worth using it. I mean, once someone starts to bm me, I just mute them and in the matter on minutes I start wondering what happened to them, are they suddenly nice and quite? You even forget about it and keep playing your best and once you're up and going, you can unmute them. Very rarely does it happen that the whole team is rude but I know it happens. You have to put your walls up against toxic players and just play the game, I know it's far less enjoyable but truly... Who cares what they say? You play, you make mistakes and you learn. Some games you might feed 1-16 but everyone has bad games and none of us are doing it on purpose.  Which brings me to the point to be simpathetic to other players. Some of us are really friendly but I do know that in case person is doing somethign wrong you can clearly see [VER] [VER] [VER] [VER] [VER].

Smite,3dyx1s,awatson824,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:04 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it's a MOBA, in literally every one that I've played you get this, SMITE is no different. The thing about MOBAs is that they openly acknowledge skill, they say that high skill is what makes someone perform good, and you don't want to look unskilled. Some people will literally say anything to divert blame from them in any regard, purely because they don't want to be flagged as unskilled. So why would people who ARE doing well, do this to other people? 2 reasons. People want to openly acknowledge that they are NOT unskilled and therefore are not responsible for the team losing, and winning and losing are statements of your skill sets, and the idea that someone can beat, not just your team, but YOU, drives them completely mad, so they get really steamed up, and start cursing and blinding or saying anything to at least rationalize why you are losing.  However, this is sometimes a combination of multiple things, if someone is trying really hard and their team play like they don't care, that's not really fair to the person trying their best, is it? Sometimes, people will try to suggest certain movements or strategies to help the team, but as I said, these people don't care enough, and are not willing to learn, so despite being level headed and trying their best to help everyone, they get met with a lack of interest, which completely deflates the person who really wants to win.  Overall, it's a 2-way street, between hot-headed people trying to look skilled, and people who are frustrated that people aren't as passionate about the game as them, and the whole thing has just come together to form what you have now. It's in EVERY MOBA with no exceptions."

Also plenty of people there are still learning so most people aren't there to give you a hard time.   Regardless though I don't think I'd ever play conquest on either platform without at least a party of 4 - randoms aren't trustworthy enough even when they are skilled. Those in conquest are going to tend to be especially egotistical and it shows in their play even if you can't hear their crap.

Smite,3dyx1s,BloatedBubble,0,Mon Jul 20 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"the thing is, you have to be realistic with your self, if they are angry or flaming you, most of the time (not always) there is some truth in what they are saying. you have to come to terms with the fact that some people blame others, but i promise you, they are not perfect either, ignore the haters, try and absorb their rants and take the positives from it.. if they are moaning at you for not rotating you gotta think about it... is he right? should i have been there? was this wave or back camp more important? OR is he being unrealistic, were they out of position and just blaming it on you. trust me best thing to do is play and learn and ignore the haters. one day you will be that good then you can hate on others ! (joke) but like i said, be realistic, you are not the best player, but neither are they, just be a man (or woman) about it and ignore them.  the trick is figuring out who is an idiot and just blaming every 1, and who knows what hes on about and just being a bit whiney (you can learn from some peoples rants)"
Smite,3dyx1s,jimlad45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:48 2015 UTC,"I always take and learn. I'm never one to ignore that if I'm in the wrong.

I'm not sure what pleasure you get out of continuing to bash me though."" And I just get a VVQ.  The first blood was our Isis, who was out of position into a fight for mid camps that I jumped out of because I had a tick of health left. She died and said I left her there alone. Of course I did. I was going to die too. I mean, there's mistakes I made that I can recognize, but others were guilty of false accusation as well. I take from it. It's just not fun to be in those kind of games."

It's even worse if the the rest of my team is dead, because as a support with hog 3 I'm kind of the only chance to secure an objective if the enemy starts one. The BM is quite dumb and even people like incon have stated before that as a support if you are the only person able to steal the objectives it's better to run out of a losing fight than save or become part of a double kill to make sure the enemy doesn't get an fg."

Smite,3dyx1s,wolfiechica,-5,Tue Jul 21 07:28:40 2015 UTC,"It's not, at all.  You just need to sack up, learn how to play the new map (you should never be 3 levels behind as a hun batz in what I assume is the jungle), git gud and have fun.  You only get out what you put in, if you're putting in a half assed effort queuing arena most of the time and then 1 conquest game every week or so you're gonna have a shit time because you're giving shit time.   Find a group of friends and queue conquest in small parties, learn the game mode, rotate and help each other, focus on objectives and the strategic nature of the game and you'll have a lot of fun.  I remember being a newer player and feeling intimidated by conquest but I knew I would have fun if I tried my best to learn how to play it properly by watching streams, reading guides and just practicing, now conquest doesn't intimidate me. Arena and Siege are much more intimidating because you have some retard on the enemy team with literally no skill beating you just because he picked ares/bellona/ymir or god with giant AOEs. Arena and Siege are also far more intimidating because all the guardians (most overpowered gods in the game) are all the same level as you and your carries! they're tanky as shit and kill you. Arena is more intimidating because 100% of people who play it have no idea how to play it, the dominant strategy is to AFK farm and never fight because there's nothing to fight for, no one uses this strategy, that intimidates me as a good player.  Seriously though, how the F were you 3 levels behind as a Hun Batz in casual jungle? there is SO MUCH FARM on the map, go help your mid laner, share back camps share red buff share blue/purple buff, god forbid you might actually have to work together to accomplish something in conquest."
Smite,3dyx1s,BloatedBubble,4,Mon Jul 20 20:40:05 2015 UTC,Why put in all this effort when you could:  A) Just play arena! B) Play single player games that have less learning curve and just as much fun! C) Go to the gym! D) Write a book!  You make Smite sound like a job.

Then we lose the fight and they call me trash. Isis especially. She didn't do anything or make any effort to ever assist me at farming mid camps. Ymir was killing camps as he went through lanes using his HOG.  I understand your ""logic"", but errors occur. Nobody's perfect to the book."
Smite,3dyx1s,TheCanadianGoat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:44 2015 UTC,Wow that Ymir must be a terrible support as a support you should always try to share the exp and gold from a camp with anyone nearby and don't ever do a buff camp alone without the jungler so they can stay relevant too. The only time you could take a camp by yourself is maybe mid camps and even then the meta is now around mid and junglers doing mids. I also ping a lot on the map and say VHH because I'm not trying to be annoying I just want to get your attention to help clear the buff camps so that you get free exp and gold while between minion waves and it helps the entire teams lead anyway.

I guess I just want to see that dragon come out and devour fools.  Interesting choice on the Pythagorem's Piece. My build is pretty much the same with the Piece being replaced by Chronos' Pendant. The 25% cooldown really helps me get prepare early for an engagement. Especially in Arena and Joust."
Smite,3e02s3,Therval,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:46:08 2015 UTC,"Same, I always preferred Chronos because being able to have that execute ready for teamfights is pretty nice to have."
Smite,3e02s3,TheSnowZebra,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:22 2015 UTC,Pyth is an especially good choice on Ao because it provides the largest amount of lifesteal. With full effiency because Ao's 2 is single target.
Smite,3e02s3,thesandbar2,2,Tue Jul 21 09:02:57 2015 UTC,"I have recently come to embrace DmBrandon's Ao build with:  Shoes of Pen, Chronos' Pendant, Poly, Obsidian; Soul Reaver; Rod. Gives you absolutely bonkers amount of damage."

Smite,3e02s3,Archont2012,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:52:09 2015 UTC,"Wild Storm counts as auto attacks, so Poly hits with it without requiring an actual auto attack.  It's short cooldown burst damage."

Smite,3e02s3,AvoidMyRage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:06:20 2015 UTC,Old AA Kuang got a major nerf when his base damage was removed and scaling was increased.  It simultaneously buffed his power build and nerfed his AA build.  The AA build is really bad now.

Smite,3e37yi,gman5852,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:32 2015 UTC,They do exactly the same for every god. The difference is the community hyping each other up.  People were pumped with Medusa/Rata so people saw the landing pages etc and thus pointed it out to the rest who didn't making it a hyped up release.  With Ravana on the otherhand people were too underwhelmed by his kit and bummed because of the lore stuff that he wasn't hyped by the community as much.  There has been no official information released on Khepri so there will be no community hype yet. HiRez will do the release page and video for him when its time(like they always do) and possibly teasers if the timing fits with some promo/eSports event.
Smite,3e0pmo,fishpasta,4,Tue Jul 21 01:41:57 2015 UTC,"done. Working in marketing & consumer insight, have you thought about adding nationalities ? In Europe we are almost forced to play with strangers, and that may be interesting to research, because we are more used to it,  which directly impacts our openness towards others. But maybe that's irrelevant for want you want to research."

Smite,3e0bol,MANJAROWOLF,4,Tue Jul 21 03:23:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree, it's obnoxious and inconsistent.

Smite,3dy6u3,Archon044,-4,Mon Jul 20 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"""Professional."" I don't think anybody should be considered pros until they get to the Invitational at SWC."
Smite,3dy6u3,zferolie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:10 2015 UTC,though there isn't any sort of venue for that for the Xbone crowd yet right?
Smite,3dy6u3,Archon044,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:31 2015 UTC,"Everything is just online right now. And the Invitational is the first confirmed LAN with only four teams.  Also it is difficult to really form teams. You go on Twitter to search for players and hope for the best. When ranked comes out I'm sure there will be roster changes and new teams rising up.  Right now the ""top"" teams consist of players that tried and failed to compete on PC. Then they moved to Xbox because it is easier.  I watch eGr's streams during tournaments and see so many mistakes that go without punishment. Also you can see how lightly they take their matches because of the lack of skill in the Xbox scene as it stands right now.  I will either be recruited for showing my skill as the top Masters player in Xbox ranked or form my own with players of the same caliber."
Smite,3dy6u3,zferolie,3,Mon Jul 20 19:25:58 2015 UTC,"Well the lack of skill is due to it just coming in open beta. Many people I have been playing against don't know the game, or the meta. I actually like it a bit, seeing people not following meta rules like robots, and trying new things since they themselves are new.  I can see it being hard to form a team on xbox. The reddit and offical forums help, but I wonder what else Hirex can do to improve.  I think its a bit harsh to say top xbox people are failed PC players. Rude too.  People are still learning. We will have an advantage till they learn. Honestly, Hirez really needs to include a lot more how to videos on this game. So many people are going in blind, and don't even know how to cancle clicking an ability, like Athena's ult. So Many people get stuck in there, I did as well. Hirez needs to step it up teaching the Xbox players things."
Smite,3dy6u3,Daft3n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"I think when people say 'failed pc players' they're talking more about the controls on pc vs xb1. The skill ceiling for mouse keyboard will always be higher than controller, so I guess the idea is that if your wrists aren't good enough for pc you can still be good on console"

Though, I must say, I much prefer coaching than playing at this point, mainly because it makes it so im not obligated to grind a game that I have over 5,000 games on after 3years. Watching replays and telling people they are bad is much more fulfilling."

Smite,3e2pjk,Merlle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"There is a massive difference in playing a ranked game of an average 20-30 minutes compared to playing arena/joust matches. Also, if you team up with 4 others, and play for example Assault, I am sure you can win like at least 60% of your games with an average game duration of no longer than 10-15 minutes. This way you can get FP a lot faster.  Also, it is summer holiday for several people now (students), thus some of them can play all day. This means you can have over 400 FP each day if you play for 12 hours."
