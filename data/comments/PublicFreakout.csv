Edit: Honesty, I finally googled to try and find out what makes people behave that way when it's a problem of their own making.  It basically comes down to a type of ""blame"" psychology where everyone else is to blame for the problem except them (shades of narcissism).  Most of them are like ""the plane is right there - let me get on"", when the plane is already pushed back from the gate and waiting it's turn for takeoff.  There are also passenger counts and fuel calculations to do based on the number of people/amount of baggage so just letting one more person on is a big deal."

And when she threw them it wasn't hard, but sort of like in a huff because she thought the airline was making such a big deal about it.  I always assumed that this lady was dealing with some major stuff we obviously don't see on camera. Perhaps a family member died. Perhaps this is the first year she's having Christmas without them. We have no idea the context. For all we know, this incident could have been the last straw in a series of events.  As viewers, though, we only get this one moment taken out of context, and assume ""entitled"", ""bitch"", ""cry-baby"", etc. And maybe that's all true, but we don't know.

I assured them that we weren't stomping or anything. They kept insisting that's what it was. I went and talked to the office and they say had just redone flooring on the entire building and that's why the ceilings were thin. I tell them this and they say, ""Well, maybe you could walk on tips of your feet or the pads and not walk heel first? We did it for the people below us."" I told them no. I have the legal right to live and walk in my apartment without hindrance. I forget the exact legal phrasing, but basically you can't be told to tiptoe in your apartment. I had spoken to a lawyer at this point because of how ridiculous they were being. They said they would keep filing noise complaints until we stopped. If you get, I think, four noise complaints where I am at, they will evict you. No questions asked. Here is the kicker they filed two. We never received notice of the first complaint. The second one the office dropped off on our kitchen counter. It was $100 each. Never consulted, never talked to us. Never investigated it. We walk down there explain that we never received the first one. They say consider this your first warning then. We explain the situation and they basically say we don't really investigate noise complaints we just take complainers word for it. I'm pissed now. The only way we can avoid getting evicted is if we somehow get these fuckers to stop filing complaints. I walk down stairs and talk to these people and we eventually work out a solution. Haven't had an issue since. Haven't adjusted my walking patterns either. But, it was an ordeal for about six weeks."

Once they even complained about my little suction Bluetooth speaker (the kind you get at Walmart for $10 bucks) that the base was too loud. From that point on I just said fuck it to any neighbor complaints. If you don't want noise don't stay at the bottom floor. Though I respect neighbors as individuals I think that complaints about walking are just way out of line. From that point on I just let neighbors call security. Security will come by and say they don't here anything. Eventually they moved.

She can't move any further over without hitting those parked cars.  There's plenty of room to ride a bike on the other side of her.   Is he expecting her to just drive in reverse back to the end of the street, I guess?"
PublicFreakout,3e29o1,ElBiscuit,12,Tue Jul 21 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"The idea is that she shouldn't come into oncoming traffic at all until it is clear of other vehicles (a bicycle being a vehicle). The lane with the obstruction yields to the lane with none, since to get around the obstruction you have to get in the oncoming lane.  Not justifying the cyclists mentality at all, he should just go around, just pointing out why he's pissy. He wants her to back up, and get out of oncoming 'traffic' until he's past."

I guess since they were already in that situation at the beginning of the video, I didn't really think about the fact that when she turned onto that street, the bike most likely would've already been there.

I can slightly understand his perspective, I'm sure he has a lot of problems with drivers not obeying cyclist rules (I know I did when I cycled daily), but being a twat isn't a solution."
PublicFreakout,3e29o1,American-American,5,Tue Jul 21 15:52:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he says somewhere in the video for her to back up, so I guess that's what he was expecting her to do."

PublicFreakout,3dzml6,JiveTurkey92,-30,Tue Jul 21 01:20:09 2015 UTC,"Didn't see the ""shoot them in the face"" part, but here's a few thoughts, some of them I don't agree with but...   Having your dirty shoes on a glass pane that others may lean against could be considered disrespectful. Having the bottom of your shoes in the face of others can be considered insulting. Even though they're not ""right there"" and there's a pane of glass between you, the psychological trigger is still there, and it's enough to piss someone off. The kids probably thought they could actually take the man since they were in a group. You see this a lot, especially in inner-cities: a group of young (mostly black) kids will act disrespectful, be chastised by someone with a bit more sense, and then they want to fight instead of just listening. The big guy obviously has anger issues, but he showed incredible restraint -- he could've easily killed that man. When you see most gang beatings like the ones I mentioned in #2, restraintis rarely shown. They keep hopping around and laughing, pumping each other up so someone will continously beat on the victim.   Slapping the shit out of a teenager who is disrespecting you, honestly, should be legal. It keeps them from getting killed over disrespecting the wrong person on the wrong day, and lets them know how to avoid situations like this. Just take your damn feet down and don't try to reason with someone who is already pissed off. It rarely ends well."
PublicFreakout,3dzml6,deedoedee,13,Tue Jul 21 03:01:05 2015 UTC,"The small guy wasn't one of the teenagers, he's a 46 year old guy who was defending the teenagers. And the older guy wasn't really showing restraint, he was the aggressor."
PublicFreakout,3dzml6,od_9,-21,Tue Jul 21 03:41:54 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I saw the little guy walking up to him like he wanted to fight repeatedly. Even after he got ktfo, he still was running his mouth, jacking up his pants (typical ghetto ""I'm being agressive"" move) while the big guy was walking away and standing a good distance from him.   He may have been dazed, but the stance you take after being knocked on your ass is almost always a tell on how you were acting prior to it. The big guy was done. The little guy was still spouting fighting words, taking a fighting posture, and getting in striking distance of the big guy. He's damn lucky he didn't get removed from the train on a stretcher."

PublicFreakout,3dv6ob,confused_c0w,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:34:45 2015 UTC,"I did once live in an apartment where the neighbors slammed the door every time they entered or exited. The apartments were actually pretty good about sound dampening.  I know it wasn't just ""typical"" door use because the way it was set up, there were four doors really close to each other (outdoor entry, two upstairs, two downstairs) and the other two neighbors could shut their doors without shaking the entire building. Their rambunctious kids could even shut the doors without shaking the entire building.  I actually found out a neighbor three apartments over hated them for the same reason. They literally slammed that door so hard that the entire building shook.  I should have gunked up the hinge so it wouldn't glide as easily........ too late now."
PublicFreakout,3dv6ob,rolfraikou,5,Mon Jul 20 20:20:16 2015 UTC,"I lived above a couple that had three severely autistic kids.  They used this is as an excuse to come up stairs and shout at us every time we did anything.  I tried to make pasta at 3 in the afternoon. Knocking at the door. ""Why are you banging up there? Our kids finally got to sleep. You need to quit the noise.""  Was talking to my room mates. Knock at the door. ""You need to stop having these parties every single night.""  On the flip side, their severely autistic kids were wailing, screaming and banging things 24/7, so we never got any kind of quiet.   They even had stickers in their windows that stated that there were autistic children in the apartment.  In San Diego noise laws can be enforced at any hour (I think it is incredibly fucking stupid) so we got the cops called on us very often.  The day we moved out, we got approached telling us to keep it down, and we happily said ""Our lease is up, tomorrow we're gone and you never have to deal with us again, if you would just let us finish moving, which we have to do, because out lease is up.""  They said ""Ok.""  They fucking said ""Ok.""  The cops showed up five minutes later, telling us initially that they had received a noise complaint about a party. We showed the police what we were doing, and one of the cops actually said ""We're about to stop answering their calls. We're so sick of this.""  They knew we were 110% in the right, and even said sorry for the times they showed up. They slowly learned how screwed up the downstairs couple were."

To purchase something of a similar size to what I was renting would have cost me far more a month in mortgage and taxes than renting did, especially in the area I wanted to live in due to my proximity to work (literally around the corner) and other amenities.  My fiance and I own a home out in the 'burbs, now, but to be honest I do miss being able to roll out of bed 15 minutes before work and still make it on time, especially when I'm doing my daily 30-45 minute commute."

Sure, you can buy a house in that time, but there's no guarantee you'll be better off monetary wise. Things break and houses require a lot of maintenance. My garbage disposal broke and the apartment just replaced it that day with no extra charges because that's one of the perks of paying rent. That would have cost me a fortune in money and/or time hiring a plumber or buying a new one and figuring out how to install it myself.

PublicFreakout,3dwqcx,coffeetablesex,10,Mon Jul 20 04:19:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there really doesn't need to be. That is if the aircraft has a door that opens inward, which most do. At the general cruising altitude of aircraft, the external pressure falls to approximately 4.4 psi. The pressure of the airplane cabin is close to 11 psi, but typically sits closer to 10.9 psi. Due to the pressure differentials, a great deal of force would need to be pulled on that door. This force would have to be over 16,848 pounds, equal to the amount keeping the door closed.  Now, lets say someone ACTUALLY manages to get this door open. The door should be small enough that (to my knowledge) no one would be sucked out. In fact, only small things such as napkins/papers would move. The issue at hand would be the rapid depressurization of the cabin."
PublicFreakout,3dwqcx,operabass93,8,Mon Jul 20 04:52:53 2015 UTC,the external pressure reaches approximately 4.4 psi. The pressure of the airplane cabin is close to 11 psi   since there is more pressure inside the plane...wouldn't that just blow the door outwards? in which case shouldn't the door open inwards? too many questions...Google to the rescue!   It is thankfully impossible to open the door during a flight as they act like a bath plug and when shut they are bigger than the opening in which they sit   I feel better now.

PublicFreakout,3dwqcx,Richman777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"Think back to when you've been in a car where you noticed that the door wasn't completely shut. You open the door and slam it shut, right?  Except try to remember what kind of force there was preventing you from opening the door wide enough to slam it. It's damned hard to fight that wind resistance and you were ravelling what? Thirty miles an hour? At 400 miles an hour, ain't nobody opening those doors even if they do open out. And as has been stated elsewhere, most aircraft doors open inward and are even more impossible to open in flight.  However, should the unthinkable happen and a giant tear appear in the cabin that releases the air pressure, you would be able to pop those inward doors with very little effort. The outward doors would still be pretty damned impossible.  So, just try not to think about a gaping tear travelling down the roof of the passenger compartment, sucking unsecured passengers and beverage carts into a 30,000 foot freefall at 500 miles an hour, bursting the eardrums and embolizing the lungs of the secured passengers as they struggle for the oxygen masks being pulled out of reach by the sucking hole above your head and you'll be fine."

I had a neighbor across the street who would sit at these large bay windows and just stare the whole day at our place. She would also go out and check her yard for leaves and pick them up as they fell. I only interacted with her once, and she made some extremely racist comments about someone else on our street, but did so in a way that was so natural, and not at all faux pas. It also had to do with a typical claim by other racists towards a certain minority, so a really misinformed remark as well. She patted me on my back as we said goodbye and I cringed.

PublicFreakout,3dvu42,honestlynotabot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"Passing cost savings on?  Uh, yes.  There's a reason why when one a Wal-Mart moves into a rural area, all of the local shops close down.  It's because they have everything in one place and the costs are so low and people are naturally frugal.  As far as treating everyone fairly, you're not going to get me to defend Wal-Mart.  I'm not on their side but we've been talking about pretty basic economic principles here.  The lower the operating expenses, the further they can drive down their prices."
PublicFreakout,3dvu42,Tripleberst,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"Usually there is someone there monitoring all of the self check outs that would have otherwise been on a register anyway, it doesn't really lower staffing numbers as much as you'd think."
PublicFreakout,3dvu42,caulfim,0,Tue Jul 21 01:52:44 2015 UTC,But you're talking about one person monitoring 8-10 self checkouts as opposed to one person per checkout line.    Is the gain in efficiency really that difficult for you to understand?

Edit: the same numbers of customers go through as would have otherwise, but now don't have to wait 5 minutes they only wait 2. The same number of customers go through, just in a shorter period. The saving isn't in the money, it's in the time people stand around and then spend complaining/going elsewhere because the line isn't as big as before. You've not magically saved on staffing costs by reducing staff there were never going to be there in the first place.    Is the gain in efficiency really that difficult for you to understand?

PublicFreakout,3dvu42,caulfim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"I worked in a supermarket mate   So did I, for years in fact.  Now I'm a data analyst.   they don't staff all of the registers especially not the big ones.   Never said they did and that really has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  Self-checkouts drastically reduce the interaction time between the customer and cashier.   the same numbers of customers go through as would have otherwise, but now don't have to wait 5 minutes they only wait 2. The same number of customers go through, just in a shorter period. The saving isn't in the money, it's in the time people stand around and then spend complaining/going elsewhere because the line isn't as big as before. You've not magically saved on staffing costs by reducing staff there were never going to be there in the first place.  the same numbers of customers go through as would have otherwise   This is where you're dead wrong.  Customers frequently abandon their carts/merchandise in the event that they can't be quickly helped as you already mentioned.  It's the same across the board - in person, on an IVR and in online sales.  People don't want to wait for service and get fed up quickly.  That leads to lost revenue, poor customer experience and less repeat business.  So yes, you DO save on staffing costs by reducing the interaction between customer and employee, you improve the customer experience and encourage repeat business as a result.  Self checkout is the best thing to happen to shoppers since credit cards were implemented.   Was that at all necessary?   Apparently it is."

This video unquestionably shows the guy in the truck escalating the situation. The dude could have had a gun to his head moments before...

At around 3:20 the father says no one pulled a gun, which the knocked out kid already admitted to.   At about 4:22 the father sounds like he says he had the gun At about 6:31 the knocked out kid is back up and approaches the driver, who asks ""why do you need a gun?""   The knocked kid, on his feet and belligerent kid replies'"" to protect myself from people like you.""  The knocked out kid frequently calls the driver a beener and his son a faggot and, like his father, appeared to be impaired at the time of this indecent.   I don't know what led up to this but I can only ascertain that the kid who was knocked out did brandish a weapon towards the drivers son and the driver took offense to that matter."

Yours is the first that is legitimately on point, in that it shows that whatever context existed was enough to persuade the State from filing criminal charges, that doesn't mean that nothing wrong happened in that video.... Just nothing that rises to a criminal wrong or worthy of public resources.   It's still a fantastic video demonstrating the technically, objective manifestation of a ""battery,"" and the blurred line between self-defense being triggered. Whether or not public policy in this community overrode the usual parity between civil torts and criminal liability, that's neat."

Even if there were a bazooka earlier, the guy in the truck is down the street, chooses to get out of the vehicle, and approach the father aggressively.  This triggers the father's right to self defense (to repel an imminent apprehension of battery), and, as such, it allows his son to ""step into his shoes"" under a theory of defense of others... So while the dude that knocked out the kid was technically defending himself, he was also technically the aggressor in that altercation, which means this video will deprive him of that defense.   Had the kid pulled out a gun and escalated the situation, then it would have reenabled the defense despite being the initial aggressor."

Sober dad has had enough of this shit and threatens to knock a motherfucker out.

I miss that word, you know? I grew up saying that word, it never meant gay.""  First, he apologizes for calling the heckler a faggot (because calling someone a faggot is offensive). Then he says how he misses that word; presumably he misses the word because he doesn't say it anymore (because calling someone a faggot is offensive). Then lastly, he says that growing up it never meant gay; that is compared to nowadays where it absolutely means gay.  Also, Louis is known for doing blue humor so it would make sense that he does a bit about missing saying faggot because it's so offensive.  Sorry.

PublicFreakout,3dqwob,mcshmeggy,14,Sat Jul 18 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"Actually I do, I am a veteran.  I know Afgan vets with real PTSD.  They internalize it quietly, despising themselves for their weakness and generally being hesitant to show it.  If they have an outburst it is typically directed towards themselves or objects.  This marine is a giant manbaby who has completely forgotten his military bearing and just wants to fight someone for fun.  He would use feigned PTSD as an excuse to seriously hurt an American civilian over virtually nothing.  He is a fucking loser and a poor representation of the Marine Corps."
PublicFreakout,3dqwob,ChangloriousOne,0,Sat Jul 18 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like he wants to fight for fun, he definitely isn't mentally sound"
PublicFreakout,3dqwob,mcshmeggy,18,Sat Jul 18 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"That's how it looks at first and I almost fell for it.  But if you look at the interview of the kid who was being threatened, he notes that the MP's required SGT Roidrage to apologize to him and the kid claimed that the marine gave a very insincere apology.  Here's the secret of PTSD: It destroys your ego.  You no longer see yourself as a functional human being, you see yourself as broken and missing the things that make you human.  The marine was threatened behind the scenes with UCMJ action if he did not apologize to the victim.  And like a giant jarhead kid himself, the marine gives a half hearted apology like some kid who has had to give his little brother his favorite toy only to take it away again when mom isn't looking anymore.  This is the demeanor of someone who still has a huge ego and a lot of growing up to do."

This fucker is actively attempting to elicit a violent response by baiting the crowd that forms with obnoxious screaming and hate speech.   Look at it this way. If a father of four beat a guy up because the guy was taking complete shit to the dad about his family, most people would side with the father (depending on the specifics of the situation). It's very comparable to what happens in this video, except nobody actually responds with violence. They are angry yes, and there is physical confrontations, but the speaker is never assaulted, on video at least.  You can't just simplify things to fit within your box of understanding. Try and think about it a bit more."

No words spoken by one person in the street to another are enough to justify violence in the eyes of the law.  So if they respond violently to words, no matter how hateful, they are by definition violent.  It actually is just that simple."

My personal belief is that if the public is able to recognize when hate speech is hate speech without motive other than to incite violence or perpetuate hate, then it should not be tolerated.   But I understand others disagree with me for whatever reason.  I'm not advocating censorship, just logical restraint when it comes to displaying and encouraging hateful attitudes."

It could be hate speech, ""fighting words"", maternal insults and biblical condemnation it is his right in the US, under the first amendment to say whatever he wants.  That is why the cops were just chilling next to him.  Now if someone attacked him, not only would they be proving the dude's point, they would also get a neck full of tazer.  He was baiting them, very plainly so, but they were just words.  And if his targets responded with violence (which they very nearly did) then they would have proven his point."
PublicFreakout,3dpv6r,ChangloriousOne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"It seems important to you that it is known that he was baiting, but in addition to that, that his point would have been proven.  I just disagree with you here.  So his point was that Islam is a religion of violence and so any violence perpetrated by Muslims (DESPITE THE CONTEXT) would be justification for his beliefs.  Thats just fallacy though. He was baiting violent behavior. The only thing that would have been proven from violent actions would be that self restraint was lacking on the offending parties part. It would show that he was good at trolling and pushing peoples buttons.  This doesn't really reinforce that Islam is a religion of violence, more that the people he is attempting to elicit violent responses from displayed an emotional reaction to his hate speech.  How would he had proven his point if he fabricated the scenario? If he had evidence of Islam being a violent religion and promoting violence that would be one thing, but he was just screaming at people in hopes that they would attack him.  It doesn't prove anything."
PublicFreakout,3dpv6r,--o,2,Sat Jul 18 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"It seems important to you that it is known that he was baiting, but in addition to that, that his point would have been proven.   His point was proven, arabic students attacked him during the video and were arrested  for it.  Islamists are so hyper-sensitive to any threat to their theocratic beliefs that they will take obvious bait and attack someone in broad daylight in front of police officers when they could easily walk away.  These are not the actions of a rational thinking adult.  These are the highly emotional reactions from someone who has let an ideal supercede their own personal sense of well being.  And this was in the first world!  Imagine if this happened in a nation with sharia law enforced, there would be executions in the street, just for words.  So much peace."
PublicFreakout,3dpv6r,drinkaveebs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:38:22 2015 UTC,How many muslims not attacking would it take to disprove his point that it's a fundamental issue with the religion?
PublicFreakout,3dpv6r,diaspora,2,Sun Jul 19 01:49:03 2015 UTC,HIs point isn't to disprove anything.  It is to bait the muslim students into violence which he actually did.  Look at the video again:   listen to the screeching girl loosing her shit over simple words. Look at the anger on the face of the short cropped arab man at the beginning who was seconds from attacking him before he was told to stop. Look at the guy in the yellow shirt who put his hands on him. Listen to the girl tell the guy in the white shirt that she was going to kill him. Look at the guy in the yellow again who takes the Quran at the end.   These are all american citizens that do not understand the first amendment.  If the cops were not there these people would attack them and beat them bloody over words and a simple book which absolutely proves the point they were trying to make.  I hate all religion equally and when I was in school we had frequent doomsday Christian ministers yelling all sorts of nonsense at us.  I did not hit any of them though because I am a veteran and the principles that America was founded on are what I served for.

To me, there is nothing that one cannot say in public, no matter how much it offends somebody because of x or y. I do not agree with your notion of offensive speech, that should be quarantined from public display. To me this extends to the tearing up of the Koran. It is presumably his property, and he can do what he wants to his property, whether other people get upset about it or not.   That said, I also believe in self defence, and if you are approaching somebody aggressively and posturing as if to commit violence against them, I believe this is an offence worthy of arrest or physical self-defence. In this case, I don't feel this fellow was threatening anybody with violence."

I feel like we've had a debate like this in America in the past and those who made your argument did not come out on top...  Free speech stops when you use that speech to limit the speech of others...or when you use it to make threats, instigate violence, riots, hate, that sort of thing. A common example I've seen is yelling ""fire!"" in a crowded building when there is no real danger. You can't do that kind of shit because people might get seriously hurt or even killed.

PublicFreakout,3dpv6r,Rafthobo,4,Sat Jul 18 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're generally illegal, but the death threat usually has to be a ""true threat"". Meaning, the threat has to be credible enough to coerce someone to act a certain way.   There's a bit of an issue as to the standard for that. Some courts instruct jurors to convict if they find that it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that the threat would be interpreted by the victim as a serious expression of intent to harm the victim. Other courts instruct the jury to convict if they believe the defendant truly intended to threaten harm.  But under either standard, it's sort of hard to say that she satisfied the standard. There's a better case against her if the first standard applies, not so much if the second standard applies. I'm not sure what the law in AZ is though."

PublicFreakout,3dounu,Gizortnik,0,Sat Jul 18 09:49:18 2015 UTC,"But it was an invitation to escalate the situation to a physical level.  It was definitely not an attack meant to injure, but the intention behind it is as gross as if it was.  As a man, I would never put my hands on another person unless I fully expected to be hit back, possibly disproportionately.  I don't know where women learn the mentality otherwise."
PublicFreakout,3dounu,rahtin,2,Sat Jul 18 10:01:17 2015 UTC,"I expect to hit people as a weapon of last resort. If I intend to hit someone, it's because I'm hoping that they won't even be able to hit back. The recorded incident may be an assault, but it doesn't require a violent response. I want to be able to live in a world where people don't need to be grievously injured for making stupid decisions and mistakes.  At the same time, I want to live in a world where everyone understands that the cost of violence is prohibitively expensive. If you consistently re-engage and escalate a situation while the other party attempts to withdraw and disengage, I'm not concerned about the damages you suffer.  This woman's actions were stupid, but do not warrant a violent response that would demonstrate the dangers of violence to her. Her actions were minimally violent to the point that there were no damages. She was entitled and stupid, but the consequences for such things should be lecturing and shame, which is what happened."

I was always told that she's technically embezzling the car, not stealing it when she fails to make payments. If she commits a crime while he's watching, then he gets involved.   She's breaking all the windows and messing up the car because she knows the game. She has nothing the bank can ever get from her, and she never will have anything the bank can ever get from her. She will never have a paycheck or any assets. She will live on welfare and government housing for her entire life. Yet somehow, she convinced someone to lease her this car.  It always amazed me how well people in the projects know where the invisible lines are. Whoever leased her this vehicle probably ignored her credit history in order to get a ""sale"". Poor people like this have shit credit, and they know that Chapter 7 is a ""get out of jail free"" card. So she probably leased this vehicle with no intent of ever paying, and she had a plan for when it got repoed. But she was smart enough to convince someone that she was good for it. As for why would you ever lease her a car - there's a lot of money to be made on the backs of poor people. Check cashing places, short-term leases, all that sort of shit has very high profit margins. By breaking the windows, she's eating into them, and she knows it (maybe not consciously, but she knows the game). They make judgement calls on who will actually pay the bills, and this is a case where they were wrong. What can they do to her? Tank her credit score? Sue her? Can't squeeze money from a stone. None of that shit matters to her.  TLDR: For her, the inherent value of driving a nice car for a few months is worth more than her credit score."

Criminal destruction of property doesn't apply here, I don't think. ""Ownership"" is a complicated concept when you're borrowed money to buy something. The car is hers, the bank just has a lien on it. IANAL, but I'm fairly sure that the bank doesn't own the car when you drive it off the lot, you do.

We can also tell that she is a woman who lives beyond her means (that's not a Honda Accord they're towing, and those rims aren't stock).

I'm pretty sure if he became a problem, we would just give him a couple of beers to relax. He also reminds me of a teddy bear a lot, and his views and actions pretty decently represent the average Dane, so I'm not super concerned. If they want me to be the perfect consumer, they should probably not take half of my income in taxes. Which means they're forcing me to spend half my paycheck each month on health, education, retirement, etc. Not exactly a good start for creating the perfect consumer. There was  no injustice going on in the link. Only a freak out, an over escalation of a small problem. Sure, we could go ahead and charge in and tackle them, and maybe I'd even die. That's for sure the best way to solve that problem. That doesn't mean I wouldn't help. Help the police find the criminals, help the insurance company pay for the damages, help the store clean up.

Though at one time in human history it may have been very important to do so, with modern social environments it's really foolish to defend property, what with insurance and law enforcement, etc. There is simply no reason to.

PublicFreakout,3ddzu4,121_Gigawhats,9,Wed Jul 15 18:57:20 2015 UTC,That's what it looks like to me. Maybe the clerk wouldn't accept their ID and wouldn't sell them whatever. I once had a guy in a 7-11 refuse to sell me a lighter because I didn't have ID. I was so pissed. Not angry enough to destroy the store however.

PublicFreakout,3ddzu4,cashmoneygillionaire,-4,Thu Jul 16 14:22:59 2015 UTC,It's a racist term...old school. Go call an elderly black man a 'catfish/bottomsucker' and see how that goes.

PublicFreakout,3dc1di,MineDrac,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:18:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds more like it was just a disagreement with management.   And even to pursue those disturbance charges, the cops would need witnesses to corroborate, which I strongly assume they didn't have, or else we would see a different conversation.  You don't have to show your ID to police in this situation. Notice how the officer is careful to keep using the phrase ""I'm asking you..."", and obstruction charges would be more along the lines of her interrupting a separate investigation.  All that said, I believe these officers were simply trying to get her name to check for warrants. If she went to jail for anything it would have been for that. Also, this lady seems like a bitch, but that's just a personal opinion and obviously doesn't mean she's a criminal."

PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,rdeluca,5,Wed Jul 15 08:45:36 2015 UTC,What the fuck is section 8?
PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,Iamthesmartest,11,Wed Jul 15 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"In the US Section 8 is a program where low income renters get subsidies to cover a portion of their rent. It's based on income and landlords can choose to participate or not. To remain on Section 8 you need to verify your income and follow all Section 8 rules, for example, if she's a single mother receiving S8, her partner may not live with her, or their income gets counted against her. Even if a partner had no income, they still cannot live in the S8 subsidized property. Properties have to be inspected and approved and landlord must comply with keeping everything up to code, as far as heat, plumbing, etc.."
PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,sassafrass14,21,Wed Jul 15 02:36:40 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter actually. The uploader put this to frame the woman as automatically wrong/ghetto because she is section 8. As we can tell by the video the woman filming is the ghetto/low class instigator and needs to mind her business.
PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,KeystrokeCowboy,15,Wed Jul 15 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"True. Section 8 participants are stigmatized harshly as are participants of any government subsidy programs. (Unless you're a millionaire receiving thousands of times more in subsidies. Then you're regarded as a hard worker or successful person.)    For context, I figured those in other countries, like Canada, would want to know what this is."

PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,Silverlight42,4,Wed Jul 15 03:25:45 2015 UTC,The woman filming should realize that if there is section 8 housing very close by than her social standing isn't much better.

PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,Beautiful_Girlie_Bob,9,Thu Jul 16 14:19:23 2015 UTC,"There are free child booster seats available so that you can safely drive your under-5-foot-tall kids in the back seat safely.  Local charities give them away.  Also, they can be bought used for the price of a cup of coffee from any thrift store.  It's so irresponsible to drive with a small child unbuckled and in the front seat.  She is, flat out, an unfit parent."
PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,Harukiller14,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:04 2015 UTC,"Buying booster seats from anywhere other than brand new is pretty unfit. They only last about one crash before you have to get a new one, kinda like helmets, and you have no idea what used ones have been through."

PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,sleepswitheyesopen,8,Wed Jul 15 05:07:25 2015 UTC,It elevates the child so the seat belt fits properly.
PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,Harukiller14,9,Wed Jul 15 05:11:12 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.
PublicFreakout,3dbwbe,SeymourCorn,6,Wed Jul 15 05:21:24 2015 UTC,A booster seat simply raises a larger child above seat level a few inches so that the shoulder belt will work as designed.  They aren't a restraining device.

If I saw someone in my house taking pictures, or NOT, you damn well be sure my hands would be on them. Along with my broom, my bat, and my cats for good measure. Or I could legally shoot them with my gun. Either way, as a single mom, I am extra protective and I do not mess around when it comes to their safety."
PublicFreakout,3dbxsa,sassafrass14,13,Wed Jul 15 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"From the video:   Some background on the lady in this video....She eventually got evicted.  Some activities that helped her get the boot include:  egging the building, vandalizing my car with glue/soda/sewing pins, pouring water on another neighbor and his motorcycle, accusing the neighbor of planting video cameras in her apartment and posting nude images on porn sites, not paying rent, accusing everyone of stealing jewelry and posting on ebay, calling the cops on neighbors for no reason...Why!  Cuz she's CRAZY.       I can almost guarantee the lady in the video is some flavor of long-term schizophrenic.  Something like 1 out of every 100 people is schizo and it can manifest itself in all kinds of ways, but usually weird shit like this.  They can be physically violent, but they're only usually ""just"" menacing or creepy at worst.      While you might be of the opinion that you could legally shoot somebody acting like this, using deadly force against a fat, middle-aged lady with a camera snapping pictures inside your home isn't as cut and dried as it might seem once the police arrive."

I'm starting to think most people don't even realize the original issue that brought us all to this, it was the flag being flown on a government building, not private property, and for some reason this had turned into a shit storm about peoples personal freedoms.  I can understand the hate for the flag, but people need to take a step back and really look at this situation.  If you take away the right for someone to own/possess/use a rebel flag for personal reason, then you begin to take away the rights that we are all granted, and that opens a can of worm I don't want to contemplate.  Just keep the flag off government buildings, and that should be the end of it, anyone who has a problem beyond that is looking for an argument, not a solution."

People have completely forgotten about that and are now all focussed on this flag. As if the killer saw the flag and went ""Oh man I just wanna kill a bunch of people now."" It's disrespectful to those who died, trying to boil all this down to the damn flag being displayed on government buildings. It's like they just want to do something that makes them feel good about themselves when they lie in bed at night, and completely ignore the actual issues that led up to that shooting. Also I agree with your previous point about freedom of speech."

The correlation here is kinda hard to miss."
PublicFreakout,3d9415,dontmindmeIworkhere,7,Tue Jul 14 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that after WWII, there was a lot of effort from Germany, now crippled again by their war debts and bankruptcy, to rid themselves of that Nazi image. I know the modern southern support of the Confederate flag hasn't been continuous since the end of the civil war, but it's still miles away from a regretful perspective as with modern germans and the Nazi flag.  Germans, and anyone else, who support Nazism and fly that flag, do so for shock and emphasis on their far right and racist views. Now, I may be ignorant of a certain subsect of that populace, but I doubt there are modern germans who claim that it's about a heritage of when they were a leader to the world. Shit, German pride is about bratwurst and beer, not about killing jews, or rising up against its European neighbors.  Again, I just may just not know of Germans who fly the Nazi flag as a heritage thing, vs outspoken racism."

The flag everyone is up in arms about isn't even the confederate flag, it's the Northern Virginia battle flag, which was re-introduced to southern Americans in the 50'a and 60's to fight against desegregation and maintain racial divides within the US.   Slavery and genocide are both regretful perspectives to look at today.   Germans, and anyone else, who support Nazism and fly that flag, do so for shock and emphasis on their far right and racist views.   Now you're getting the idea, almost. I don't know of any germans who fly the nazi flag and use the ""Heritage not Hate."" ideal. That was never my point. My point was, from the perspectives of minorities, the Northern Virginia Battle flag is just as an atrocious symbol of hate to them, as a nazi flag would be to jewish people.  They see these people waving that flag yelling ""Heritage not hate,"" like jewish people would if a german was waving the nazi flag and making the same statement. (Again, I'm not implying there are germans out there doing this, there may be, but i don't know)  I think you're misunderstanding the context in which I was laying things out, I hope that clears it up."

You're obviously not well versed in history. The South had 2 opportunities to burn Washington to the ground. Two major conflicts took place within ~35 miles of Washington, Bull Run. They could have marched on it and burned it to the ground if they wanted to because of the crushing defeat the United States had at both left it pretty much defenseless.  The Confederacy attempted a diplomatic solution in where both country's existed by using England and France's powerful influence. England only sort of bit but didn't really need their cotton. They had plenty.  Almost acknowledgement by England as a country helped trigger the passing of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Flag lady would not drive her truck like that all over america.  Who is in charge of ensuring everyone follows a code of conduct is a question that cant simply be answered.

PublicFreakout,3d9415,sofakingood,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:49:35 2015 UTC,"We as a society have laws in place protecting free speech. Protecting that right is very important. It doesn't mean you agree with whoever is exercising the right. The ACLU has defended the KKK's right to free speech not because they agree with the Klan but because the right to free speech is that important.    Who is in charge of ensuring everyone follows a code of conduct is a question that cant simply be answered.   There lies in the problem, what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Censoring speech based upon a 'code of conduct' is a slippery slope. What is the 'code of conduct' based on? Who is in charge of what's acceptable or not?  Allowing a government to censor speech is a bad idea. There are many people in jail in other countries due to their speech. People are working all over the world to have free speech in their own countries. It is a cherished right.  As for 'flag lady' she is doing everyone a favor by showing her opinions. Outward racism is very easy to identify, it helps everyone else know what type of person they are and makes it easier to disassociate themselves.  The real problem is inward racism that is not spoken. The people who treat others unfairly due to color, race, religion or creed. Change attitudes comes with education and acceptance, not by trying to regulate behavior with laws.

PublicFreakout,3d9o44,frezner,15,Tue Jul 14 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"All of you doing the ""equal rights means equal lefts"" bullshit   So at the time of your comment, the one female in the thread who made that remark then.   All of you doing the ""equal rights means equal lefts"" bullshit are just misogynists who get boners when people do violence against women.   There is some undoubted crossover between that position and sexists, but taking that position doesn't make someone a sexist. They would be sexist beforehand.   No one should be able to attack others and then cower behind their sex as a free pass. People are allowed to defend themselves, regardless of the sex of the attacker. Making special allowances for either sex is going to be sexist one way or the other; you're giving an entire sex a licence to bring harm to others while they can use their sex as a shield. That is not equality in any sense.   There was no invocation or expectation of ""female entitlement"" present in this video at all. you're just assholes.    Female hits male. No notable reactions. Male hits female. Volume raised as multiple people chastise him but none of them ever chastised her at all. And that's before the window gets shattered. She hits him and the mood is unchanged, he hits her back and only then is hitting others not permissible. For her part, she could very well be the scrappy sort. Maybe she fully expected to get hit back and didn't care. Be that as it may, you can still see the culture of 'female entitlement/you don't hit a woman' in the reactions of the others there and when exactly it is that they decide to chastise people for hitting people.    the reason that man is arrested and that woman isn't is because that man walked across the entire restaurant on a mission to disproportionately assault that woman specifically.   That's a nice narrative pulled out of thin air there. Here's what happened:   Police were called in to the Totnes “kebab house” after receiving reports of a group of about 20 youths who were trying to into the restaurant, the Torquay Herald Express reports. Footage of part of the incident was uploaded to the internet and shows a standoff between staff, backed by a man in a green hooded top, and a group of people in the doorway of the takeway restaurant.  The rabble picked out and beat on some uninvolved passerby after the incident   In sum, the police were called on the rabble of about 20 youths. The staff of the kebab house did not seem to want to allow them entry for one reason or another. The man in green helped the staff in keeping the rabble controlled and outside of their private premises. While doing so, the man is attacked. He attacks back. And only then is hitting people chastised.  Where disproportionate response is concerned, I agree with you there. It is the sole thing you haven't managed to pull out of thin air in your flimsy narrative. The man could have pulled his punch for sure there. While he was within his rights to defend himself, and under no obligation to take a beating from anyone regardless of their sex, he didn't have to hit as hard as he did either."

Simply responding to the statement that after the fact and after being punched he was useless in helping his partner.

PublicFreakout,3d0le2,K3R3G3,13,Mon Jul 13 05:32:57 2015 UTC,One real bad thing about the firearm discharge was that two other people were behind the target -- the guy at the head of the table and the other security guard.

PublicFreakout,3d0le2,quantumdildo,53,Mon Jul 13 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"I think this guy has a strong case for self defense   To successfully argue self defense he has to prove:   He was not at fault in creating the conflict; he had a bona fide belief he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm his only means of escape was the use of force; and he did not violate a duty to retreat or avoid the danger.   I would be interested to see someone prove those four facts given this situation.  Especially since Skidmore breaks contact with the officer at 2:20 of the video, then immediately lunges forth to resume attacking him.  EDIT: Oh my god I can't believe you people. Skidmore is being charged with felonious assault in the state of Ohio, and here is an Ohio attorney's webpage confirming what I wrote on felonious assault and self-defense."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,Cyntheon,14,Sun Jul 12 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"What you posted is the requirements for a self-defense defense when using deadly force. Close, but doesn't really apply here.   You're not required to leave/escape a situation which before resorting to non-deadly force in any State in the US. Duty to retreat only applies when escalating to deadly force, which Skidmore didn't do. So he was fine by fighting the guard in that regard.  If self self-defense against an armed security guard works the same way as self-defense against the police though, using that defense also requires the detainment/use of force to be illegal or excessive. It wasn't in this case (also excess could be argued). However, the way the guard handled (pulling him by the neck brace of the camera without saying a word) could very well be mistaken by an assault rather than an escort outside the building. A mistake as to the guard's lawful status is allowed as long as its reasonable (and it definitely looks very reasonable).  I think Skidmore has a pretty good self-defense case here. Hell, the guard might be in more trouble than Skidmore for escalating to deadly force (in which your requirements do apply and, in my opinion, the guard does not meet)"
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,quantumdildo,27,Sun Jul 12 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"What you posted is the requirements for a self-defense defense when the force used was deadly.

PublicFreakout,3d0le2,Cyntheon,9,Sun Jul 12 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"It seems you are right, I wasn't aware of the charge that was brought up against him (didn't pay much attention by the end). I'm not really sure why Skidmore's actions constitute serious physical harm though... By the looks of the video it seems it was because of the biting, which I believe he could argue was self-defense since it happened after he was almost shot (so his life is in danger - and the guard's shooting could very well be seen as excessive and thus unlawful) and by that point he was pinned down by 2 men, one of which had shot him seconds go, so he had no escape.  I'm not a lawyer or anything, I'm just a criminology student that's taken a couple of criminal law classes, so my assesments are very black and white as well as ""naive"" in a way. Sorry for that."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,fatthand9,13,Sun Jul 12 19:30:47 2015 UTC,"The state will argue that the guard thought his life was in danger once Skidmore punched him in the face.   The guard was useless and awful at his job, but I think there is a much better argument that he was acting in self defense.  If you punch a man with a gun you have to acknowledge that they might shoot you."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,26point2Beast,15,Sun Jul 12 19:49:51 2015 UTC,"I don't see there being a ""much better argument"" that the guard was acting in self defense.  The guard initiated what could be viewed as unlawful contact with Skidmore, when Skidmore retaliates (excessively) the guard retaliates even more excessively.  So the guard instigated the confrontation and vastly over reacted by shooting a gun in a crowded room.  Both people made mistakes but the guard's mistakes were far more grievous.  For what it's worth, I think the guard deserved the first punch, going back for seconds was Skidmore's mistake."

PublicFreakout,3d0le2,Cyntheon,2,Sun Jul 12 21:27:10 2015 UTC,"You do if it was escalated to deadly force. For example, you punch someone, that someone pulls a gun on you and starts shooting. You would be in the right in taking out your gun and shooting him.  You can claim self-defense for any force that is unlawful. When you punch someone they are by law protected when punching you back, so they're using lawful force. If they take out a gun and start shooting, they have done so unlawfully (they're not allowed to shoot you for punching them because they're not in danger of death or serious bodily injury) so now YOU are lawfully allowed to take out your gun and shoot him (assuming you couldn't run)."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,26point2Beast,2,Sun Jul 12 22:39:07 2015 UTC,"It’s interesting to me who people decide to hate on in this circumstance.  I feel kind of bad for ol’ Skidmore.  I don’t know the details but from what I gather, it seemed like he had a legitimate point about the security guards being up to some sort of bs and apparently he had every right to be there with his camera.  Seemed like he was being generally disrespected and then he was accused of “putting his hands” on someone, when he really didn’t do anything that could really be viewed as aggressive in nature.  Anyway, people seem to want to hang ol’ Skidmore for throwing a couple of hay makers.  I think charging him with assault is in order, but if he’s never been in trouble with the law before, I don’t think he’s some “unstable” nutter who needs to do hard time.  He got worked up and blew his stack on some guy who shouldn’t have been messing with him."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,Cyntheon,2,Mon Jul 13 04:42:06 2015 UTC,"I think he should be charged with simple assault, but not felonious assault. He only bit the second guard (which is the basis for the charge) after he was shot at, which is something that I think would have anyone quite rattled and not exactly thinking clearly (specially since he was already agitated).  I definitely got a ""this is fucking unfair"" vibe coming from him though. He's got what seems to be valid complaints and he's just getting dismissed, shamed, and manhandled... And he just popped.

The problem is that while the list is specific and subjective, interpreting the events is subjective and varies with each case.

PublicFreakout,3d0le2,404-FuckNotFound,10,Sun Jul 12 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The guy went way too strong way too quickly. But it's really unsettling that you'd be in a public, government building, with cops who have their badges turned around, won't ID themselves, try to remove your camera, and do it without warning.     I'm sure it wasn't all Big Brother stuff, but it seems like a massive abuse of trust and power. Plus, sorry to sound judgmental about a tense situation, but who the hell pulls their service gun and unloads in a crowded room, on a guy that's clearly just throwing two handed bruising punches, not trying to pull anything out, in front of a bunch of public servants, while you have armed backup there. This guy drew that thing fast and just tried to kill him. I think if a normal guy had made his decision that fast, they would at least consider the possibility that he overreacted.

The guard was way more at fault than the journalist, even though the journalist acted terribly.   When you have a gun, you must act responsibly. Getting into a fight is extremely dangerous for everyone, as anybody could grab the gun. Walking up to the guy and grabbing his camera is simply inexcusable. The fact that he didn't say a word is even worse."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,Zantier,9,Sun Jul 12 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"If he didn't fire on purpose or draw his weapon on purpose and it still went off, he probably shouldn't have a firearm at all because of what you said - anybody could grab that gun and fire it.

Old man should not have punched   Security shouldn't not have pulled gun let alone fire a shot.   I would say assault and battery charges for old man. And security officer should be fired and charged for being incompetent for creating and failing at a life or death situation. Perhaps revoke any licence he has to carry fire arms cause I I wouldn't trust that fool with a super soaker.   EDIT clarified my thought a little on the punishment of the security officer.

Negligent discharge; reckless endangerment; disorderly conduct (for the old man, as well); assault with a deadly weapon; or, the most obvious - attempted murder.     There is absolutely no justification for him to have fired his sidearm. No judge or jury would ever agree with his claim of being afraid for his life.

Dude might get like 5 months in jail, and then do community service, probation, etc.  Not saying the journalist was in the right by swinging on the security guard, but BY NO MEANS should that security guard have pulled out his gun, it was not a life-threatening situation at all.."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,Cepheus,24,Mon Jul 20 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"The guard approached the man without first engaging him in conversation and put hands on him. They should have asked the man to leave or asked him to move to another area, and if he refused then they should have adjourned the meeting temporarily and had everyone else step outside while they dealt with him.   They did not identify themselves, which it sounds like was part of the reason the man was aggravated in the first place, yet they work for the county/state whatever, not sure what the exact laws are about this, but maybe they're required to state their name?  Once the shot was fired I looked at the gentleman in the bottom right corner because I thought he may have been hit. The shot was not let off in a controlled motion, if anyone decided to take a shot it should have been the second guard at the time. I feel that the guard who was initially attacked should be severely reprimanded for making the shot as it had a very large chance to miss and hit an innocent party."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,esfisher,8,Sun Jul 12 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"Even if the shot had hit the guy attacking him, it would still have been excessive use of lethal force. I hope the guard was fired.

A trained professional knows how to deescalate people like that to prevent people from getting hurt."
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,denissimov,3,Sun Jul 12 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"They should have asked the man to leave or asked him to move to another area   That's an important point.

Woman at the table mentions that sometimes they flip their badges (not sure why someone would do that), another woman says ""you are welcome to look at it"". She welcomes him to look at her badge, he approaches her, she becomes defensive. Then some dude (I can't see any security insignia on him) approaches him and grabs his camera. Fist flying, shots firing. Dumb on both sides."

He purposely drew his weapon and fired at another human being while his comrade is in tow. By the looks of the barrel's direction two people were missed by a matter of feet by his stupidity.  The cameraman is a douche. What did he gain by going up to the woman and touching her? Never sleep on old man. He was thug nasty to the core. Those punches were in bunches. If he weighed more and/or knew how to throw a punch he would have knocked that guard out cold with the first shot. He is crazy enough to attack an armed man!Even after the gunshot he continues to throw punches."

PublicFreakout,3d0le2,Semper_OFP,3,Tue Jul 14 01:21:38 2015 UTC,Why did he attack the security guard?
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,deathstrukk,10,Tue Jul 14 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"The ""security guard"" was robbing him inexplicably. You can defend yourself against strong armed robbery with non deadly force (fists in this case). He steps back after initial defense, and notices security guard with a gun drawn.  He now is facing deadly force and can use whatever defense is required. He goes in with more fists and it likely saved his life. After shot is fired he can use whatever biting eye gouging and impromptu weapon he can to save his life. These were not LEOs. These were citizens that were robbing him without justification or explanation.   This would be a fun case for a good defense lawyer."

PublicFreakout,3d0le2,VanBurensChops,2,Sun Jul 12 16:23:50 2015 UTC,A gun is just completely unnecessary in the situation. There's ten other people there to stop him from getting slowly mauled to death by an old man. In any other country this would have been a scuffle only.
PublicFreakout,3d0le2,sohoodnerd,2,Sun Jul 12 17:10:54 2015 UTC,The security guard never identified himself and never gave instructions to the guy with the camera to leave or get on the ground or that he was being detained.  He basically said nothing and just walked up and grabbed him.  Soooo.... yeah this was extremely unprofessional on the security guards part if someone unannounced walked up to me and grabbed me I might just punch them in the face.... even if the dude with the camera was being a little annoying and douchbaggish he still had a right to be informed by security who they were and what request/commands he was expected to follow.

Even if he had shot the man he was intending to shoot i don't think it would be morally just to have killed him over that. guns should be used as a last resort and kept away from people who cant handle being hit a couple of times by unarmed civilians!

The guy who chased him for half a block fits the bill of an actual warrior for social justice a lot better.

Really though, obviously the transit officers would have only just seen a guy knocking a girl to the ground and they reacted but it would have been nice if even one of the passengers explained the girl was losing her shit and attacking people."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,the_arkane_one,24,Sun Jul 12 01:54:58 2015 UTC,No shit. They all just stood there and watched.
PublicFreakout,3cynds,dtrmp4,17,Sun Jul 12 05:59:58 2015 UTC,"He engaged her after she started walking away.  You don't have a right to physical justice, you have a right to self defense.  He was no longer threatened and he went after he because he was salty.  He wasn't even trying to subdue her,  he wanted to hit her in the face, so that excuse doesn't work either."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,rahtin,2,Sun Jul 12 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"I don't get why you're being downvoted. You're explaining what the law is.  I however would have done the same reaction as the dude had.  He really wouldn't get in trouble post fact, especially if there is a video of this. Jury of your peers."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,lt_hindu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:23:54 2015 UTC,"It's basically the same situation as seeing a person chasing someone that's dashing away and both are screaming.  The cops don't know who's being chased or why, but chances are they'll take down whoever's looking more threatening first because they have no idea who's the aggressor.  They have no clue if the person running just stole a phone or if the person chasing is trying to punch their lights out for no good reason.  At the end of the day the situation will be explained like the one in the video.  But cops can't just come into every fight knowing who started it, they are there to fix the situation as fast as possible."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,Taj_Ramos,-11,Sun Jul 12 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he didn't need to square off with her. Gender issues aside, she was obviously messed up and had actually walked away. He went after her. He wasn't in any immediate danger at that point. He chose to escalate the situation. Whether you agree or not, that doesn't meet the legal criteria for self defense. If this exact video were shown in a courtroom, there is absolutely no way this guy could claim self defense. That would be true even if the genders were reversed. As menacing as she looked, she barely even harmed him. He fucking rocked her.  You people really need to read up on self defense laws. They're not an excuse to beat the shit out of a person who hits you a tiny little bit. Like it or not, that's the law.  Edit: You guys can downvote me all you want. I wasn't defending the woman's actions in any way. She clearly made some bad choices and couldn't handle her shit. She certainly suffered the consequences. I was simply pointing out the legalities of self defense.  It's really quite weird how much reddit loves to see women get beat up over the slightest provocation, then use ""self defense"" as an excuse, even when it obviously isn't legally applicable. I'm sorry, but if you guys could just get laid already, then maybe you'd realize that women aren't evil creatures whose sole purpose is to make you miserable. And then just maybe this site wouldn't be such a misogynistic shithole.   ""If the guy is drunk and high, it's not rape or assault, because he didn't know what he was doing. And she was just as drunk, btw."" ""She took drugs and couldn't handle herself...she's completely responsible for her actions and deserves to get her ass kicked. It's her fault for taking drugs in the first place.""   So much hypocrisy."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,schniggens,3,Sun Jul 12 09:11:11 2015 UTC,"I like how you know so much about thia man just from the video. My guess is that he did not see her freakout before she attacked him so he could of just been pissed that somebody attacked him for no apparent reason. And the biggest issue is hat none of the other passengers said anything about the woman attacking the man, especially the person recording it."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,Swandive_,0,Sun Jul 12 09:55:22 2015 UTC,"the biggest issue is hat none of the other passengers said anything about the woman attacking the man   Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with you there. Although I'm assuming the cops were called as soon as she started hitting him, but they just happened to arrive a few moments later when he had the upper hand. They came upon the scene and saw a person being viciously battered by another person. What the fuck would you expect them to do? They're not omniscient. They didn't know what happened beforehand. They detained the aggressor and de-escalated the situation. That's exactly what they're supposed to do. If Mr. Bumbaclot had simply waited for the police to arrive, instead of going all vigilante, then she would most likely have been the one in handcuffs at the end.  Either way, what the guy did was not legal self defense. He let her walk away, then attacked her. I'm still waiting for someone to tell me how that meets the legal requirement for self defense.  Edit: I'm just going by exactly what I saw in the video. You seem to be the one making assumptions about the people in the video."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,schniggens,0,Sun Jul 12 23:37:41 2015 UTC,"I think that the cops were on the train from the start unless the have invented teleportation. And I'm not making assumptions I'm guessing. I also did not say anything about self defense. But you talk as if the women did nothing wrong while she sheems to have taken a substance which she is either unfamiliar with or has no control over and gone out in public, which I think is highly irresponsible."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,Swandive_,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:52:09 2015 UTC,Fuck this attitude. You can sit there and be societies punching bag but the rest don't need to put up with others shit.
PublicFreakout,3cynds,UrbanZenMonk,9,Sun Jul 12 11:52:47 2015 UTC,"It's not an attitude,  it's reality.  He didn't defend himself while she was attacking him,  he waited until she walked away and turned her back then he swarmed her.  If he would have smashed that Pringles can upside her stupid head while he was still sitting,  he would be 100% in the right,  but he started round two because his ego was hurt."
PublicFreakout,3cynds,rahtin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"Um, yeah, he chose to sit there and be her punching bag. Then he went after her when he realized she was drugged out of her fucking mind and he knew he had the upper hand. I'm not sure what the hell you think you're talking about."

PublicFreakout,3cynds,Big_Papi_Knows,20,Sun Jul 12 04:11:52 2015 UTC,"I had assumed they were somewhere on the train, and once the male started attacking someone pressed a button, or called them somehow.

PublicFreakout,3cynds,littlel8totheparty,7,Sun Jul 12 02:44:35 2015 UTC,I live in edmonton and apparently I was a lack of drugs that caused it. The girl suffered from mental illness and wasn't taking her medication I guess.
PublicFreakout,3cynds,HolyTriforce,5,Mon Jul 13 05:40:03 2015 UTC,"Judging by the jaw clenching, the thousand-mile stares, and the rolling around, I'd say crack and/or meth, most likely some kinda cocktail. Only really intense uppers can make you feel like doing that kinda shit with your body.   I'm kinda thrown off by how she digs through her purse somewhat normally, though."

PublicFreakout,3cynds,rahtin,-1,Sun Jul 12 06:01:44 2015 UTC,It seemed to be a more likely drug than pcp judging from how she was dressed. Or even weed laced with something.   And I don't know. I've seen some pretty intense videos.

PublicFreakout,3cynds,AnimalNation,2,Sun Jul 12 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"Better yet subdue them.  Punching people out can lead to nasty brain damage and people have even died from it.  Not to mention a well placed hold can bring the fight to a standstill much more quickly than punches and with less injuries to both parties.    Hell, this chick was probably so high she'd probably get grappled and subdued by someone with just basic knowledge of wrestling in seconds."

PublicFreakout,3cynds,BWildeallday,4,Sun Jul 12 00:44:15 2015 UTC,Look at the video. After the woman walks away he goes after her and attacks her. That's not self-defense anymore.

PublicFreakout,3cynds,NAFI_S,3,Sun Jul 12 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"Frontal lobe seizures may manifest bizarre behaviors such as thrashing, kicking, genital manipulation, un- usual facial expressions, and articulate vocalizations.1 Aggressive and violent behaviors have also been asso- ciated with epilepsy, especially temporal or frontal lobe seizures.2 However, this behavior is rare in the ictal state. Aggressive ictal behavior is generally be- lieved to not be goal directed. Interactive behavior with the ability to respond to visual and verbal stim- uli is also rare in complex partial seizures. We report the case of a patient with seizures manifesting with interactive directed aggressive behaviors.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849702/pdf/7123.pdf"

PublicFreakout,3cxk5s,BobPlager,-44,Sun Jul 12 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"That's horseshit.   Relevant quote from my favorite Reacher novel.    The first rule of street fighting is when you get your guy on the ground you finish him, no hesitation, no pause, no inhibition, no gentlemanly conduct. You finish him. Paulie had ignored that rule. I didn’t. I kicked him as hard as I could in the face. Blood spurted and he rolled away from me and I stamped on his right hand with my heel and shattered all the carpals and metacarpals and phalanges that he had in there. Then I did it again, two hundred fifty pounds of dead weight stamping down on broken bones. Then I stamped again and busted his wrist. Then his forearm.   Edit: this sort of advice should only be followed in an extreme circumstances. ALL street fights should be avoided. If you are forced into one however you finish the fight. Gentlemanly contact is for fights with a referee, streets fights are no holds barred."
