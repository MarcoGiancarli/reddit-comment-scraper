discgolf,3dqt9o,TheRealLilSebastian,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"If they're just a couple chilling   Yeah, IF, until they start freaking out on opiates or need more and don't have the money to get so they rob a person and potentially stab them for refusing to be robbed.  I know, worst case scenario, but it is really not appropriate for people to be literally shooting up at a public disc golf course.  If you REALLY want to ruin your life with heroine, PLEASE for the love of God stay in your dwelling and do not leave and disturb any other human being with your stupid bullshit.  Want to smoke a joint or roast a bong on the course? I could give a care less so long as you're not being in peoples faces with it ( like blowing smoke at them, be courteous with your smoking ) and aren't being an ass on it.  Being high on Cannabis does not inhibit normal Cannabis users from functioning just as any otherwise completely ""sober"" person would, albeit slight differences thanks to the Cannabis such as probably being just generally happier due to being ""high"".  Want to have some alcoholic drinks on the course?  Fine by me, just do not become drunk, especially not if you are driving home from the course.  Cannabis does not put you on an insane trip for hours that you can't stop like Mushrooms or LSD or Heroine.  Mushrooms and LSD and Heroine are not just ""casual"" drugs people can just do and then go about their day, because they will be tripping with no end in sight for at least 4 hours, that's how those substances work.  I'm all for legalization of many recreational substances, but obviously well within reason.  Cannabis needs to be legal for all people 18 and older to consume recreationally, with medicinal being available for those under 18, and the same level of penalization for consumption by minors that it is for alcohol as there is no need to penalize more for a far less damaging substance on both the individual and societal level.  LSD and Mushrooms need to be legalized, if for recreational use, in a very regulated manner wherein people are logged as having purchased the amounts they purchase.  We have gun registries, why not ""recreational user"" registries?  If people want to consume these substances in a safe and regulated manner, why not allow it?"
discgolf,3dqt9o,dsprox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"I mean I agree with all your legalization rhetoric... But heroine and opiates don't make you trip, they're a chilled/euphoric feeling.

I don't want to hang out with anybody high on opiates because they just sit there all retarded because that's what it does to you.   Nothing even remotely similar to LSD.   I agree, nothing compares to the feeling of being throw into an energy vortex for 6 to 10 hours straight and the insane overwhelming intensity it creates."

discgolf,3dqt9o,PotageAuCoq,0,Sun Jul 19 12:22:55 2015 UTC,"Why is it dangerous?   Don't play stupid man, people running around high on opiates can be extremely dangerous, have you never had to deal with a person freaking out on drugs?  I've seen people try breaking sliding glass doors to get back inside a house they were temporarily told to go outside into the yard of because they were being too ridiculously drunk.  Once we got that person to finally stop before he actually broke it he threw up and passed out on the grass.  I once was at a house an one of the 3 guys there with me apparently had consumed part of a Cannabis brownie, himself not being a smoker or regular Cannabis consumer, which caused him to seriously freak out.  He collapsed on the floor and started thrashing his head on the ground, which I had to stop, and then at one point as he was on his knees in the kitchen looking towards the knifes he said out loud "" To kill a man? For the first time?"" with a bizarre crazed look on his face, thus we physically restrained him for the duration of his bad freak out until he was sober again.  People on mushrooms freak out and can't be trusted in public alone on it unless they're a super experienced tripper and have greater mental faculties which don't allow their mind to become prisoner to the trip and still retain their logical normal world view and ability to navigate through the world like a sane and sober human being.  People on LSD are pretty much fine in public if once again they know what's up and they can handle it.  Heroine? Meth? Yeah, two VERY different substances which have much more violent reactions with people, and heavily affect their cognitive and motor skills.   It doesn't affect you, so what do you care?   It actually does affect everybody in the area because they start association disc golf and heroine addicts, and since they already associate Cannabis and alcohol with disc golf, they then associate heroine with cannabis and view all drugs users as evil garbage, and then they go and assume probably half of all disc golf players are just drug addict loser garbage people.  THAT is how it affects us, kind of like people trashing up disc golf courses with alcohol containers, makes us ALL look bad.   If you don't like it don't look.   Apply that logic the next time you see somebody being help up in public screaming for your help and realize how shitty of a thing looking the other way is."

discgolf,3drimn,e8odie,11,Sat Jul 18 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"Your use of hyzer and anhyzer is easily confused with turn and fade.  Its far better to identify hyzer and anhyzer as release angles and not post release traits.  The idea is to linguistically separate the two things.  You ""release the disc with a bit of hyzer"" then (1) ""It turns (a hyzer flip of some sort) (2) it fades.  I think a graphic identifying ""hyzer"" as being all the outside edge down angles and ""anhyzer"" as all the outside edge up is ideal.  Then, another graphic showing the turn and fade.    I also think it would be helpful to substitute the flight paths for different discs with a select few flight paths showing typical shots.  i.e. (1) A turn over, (2) A flex shot, (3) A spike hyzer, etc.  I think thsi is probably way mroe complicated than I make it sound, because you'd have to identify whether the disc was ""overstable"" (a flex shot), ""neutral"" (a hyzerflip to straight-fade, fored anny, etc), or ""understable"" (hyzer flip to fade, hyzer flip to turnover, etc)  I'll leave you with that to chew on.  Hopefully it helps.  This graphic is a really cool place to start, and if you could get it totally right, it could be an amazing tool for new players."
discgolf,3drimn,SearchingforSilky,3,Sat Jul 18 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"That's all great input, thanks.  As much as I agree that a graphic on (an)hyzer should focus on describing the release angle, you can't not include that that release angle is going to affect how it turns/fades.  As for the sample flight paths, I feel like going into all that detail you described might be a bit overkill for a newcomer looking at this. Instead, I wanted to just simply show an array of discs to show how much variety there is (something I don't think most beginners think of) and also to display some general trends (shorter throws/putters travel straighter, all tend to fade, etc.).  However, I did try and make some adjustments with some of your (and others') comments in mind. Here's the most updated version."

discgolf,3drimn,bombmk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the release angle affects the path from the moment the disc leaves your hand.  The flight paths over the hyzer images all show the path of a disc released flat.  Plus, hyzer is more likely used if disc is understable, but they're on opposite sides of the scale.  Make the release angles visually separated from the disc stability, and you have a beautiful graphic."
discgolf,3drimn,TXmarijuanito420,3,Sun Jul 19 14:09:00 2015 UTC,"First thought: In order to make the small text readable, the picture has to be so big that you need to scroll sideways to see it all on many screen sizes. Scrolling sideways is generally not as easy as scrolling up and down.  As far as I can see, you have not specified that the right/left descriptions are from a RHBH perspective - which a beginner might not consider.  I second Silkyboy's recommendation of separating release angles from disc stability.   And the Speed description could use a specification that it is a distance potential, given the right technique.

They see vandalism and take that as a cue to join in. You can't allow selective markings because it endorses any markings. You are basically arguing, ""I can litter because I clean up the course.""

discgolf,3drczd,SteveDart,2,Sun Jul 19 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"By the letter of the law, you're committing vandalism when you mark your ace on the basket. As u/Oglshrub said, your club may have funded the basket and you may have personally installed it, but it falls under ownership of the municipality once you put it on the public course. You pretty much donated the equipment to the city. So it doesn't really matter that you don't believe you are committing vandalism, because you are defacing public property. Like another poster said, you and your group can sign your disc and I bet you could even post a photo on the message board at hole 1, but writing on baskets/benches/signs/tables/trashcans/trees/teepads/etc with permanent marker should be unacceptable.

discgolf,3dr2lw,rarecare,6,Sat Jul 18 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"So, it depends on the level of sponsorship.  The top pros have a bonus schedule based on how they finish at events.  Finish first in a C-Tier might be worth $150, while finishing first at an A-Tier might be worth $1,000.  This goes for all of their sponsors.  So, when that A-Tier is won, the player might collect $1,500 from Innova, $1,000 from Grip, $750 from their clothing sponsor, etc.    I've also heard before that some sponsors will match what you win.  So, if the purse is $2,500, you will earn $2,500 from the sponsor.  This seems good because it pushes players into the highest paying events.  It benefits the players, and the TD's.  I think there's probably a number of guys making better than $50k these days.  I think McBeth, Ricky, Will Schusterick, are all making good money as compared to all fields.

When I am making all my putts in the circle, staying out of OB, and generally playing solid, mistake-free golf, it feels normal.  Like.. this is what I should be doing every time.  It's the missed putts, bad upshots, and shanked drives that hurt.    It's all subjective, too.  If I make a handful of 30-40' putts in a round, I feel pretty good, whereas that's normal for better players.  I think that this mindset kind of proves that the game is so ingrained in players.. there are often so many more lows to a round than there are highs, and yet we keep going out every day, trying to find that high while minimizing the numbers of lows."

discgolf,3dr4tf,mtndewgood,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I feel.  It's why I play Advanced even though my rating says I can play in Int.  I know that I'm capable of Advanced-rated rounds.  I know that I'm capable of putting together whole, Advanced-rated tournaments.  When I play to that ability, it feels natural.  Everything is clicking and it doesn't feel forced.  I might get a bit excited about it, but otherwise I'm just along for the ride.  But when I'm playing 920 or worse golf, it feels terrible.  I'm missing putts and I know it's hurting my scores.  I'm shanking my drives and I know it's forcing me to scramble more than I want.  All these things build and build until you're looking at an emotionally crushing round.  You're always going to be your worst critic, so when you don't perform to your potential, it's easy to beat yourself up over it.  When you figure out how not to do that, let me know :D"
discgolf,3dr4tf,CaptainBad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:56:16 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with sentiment. I shot a 989 rated round at TX States that just felt ""decent"", I was rated 896 at the time. Same story at GBO, shot what I though would be a half decent round and ended being 3rd out of 168.  Simon's quote pairs well with the idea that the Pro's don't birdie every hole, they just don't bogey very often. I think this is why great rounds feel normal, because in our minds we remember the birdies we missed, not the ones we got or the bogeys we didn't get."
discgolf,3dr4tf,cenosillicaphobia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:59:35 2015 UTC,"Solution to your problem: Just have fun, that's what it's all about anyway. Thinking too hard about it like this just screws your mental game up, which once you've developed knowledge of how to properly throw all of your discs..is a really big part of the game. Just focus on making less mistakes, and also recovering from said mistakes."
discgolf,3dr4tf,Treplexity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:02:26 2015 UTC,"I think I might be the opposite of this..I love all of it.. the good, the bad, the ugly.  when I am playing a good round, drivers are soaring, mids are doing everything I need, and my putter just can't miss, I relish it. I know this can change quickly,  from hole to hole and round to round. It is those rounds that help me through the crappy one's where everything is off and your discs manage to find every tree in the park. But all in all it is a game played in beautiful scenic settings."
discgolf,3drmsf,e8odie,6,Sat Jul 18 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"There isn't a direct correlation to the speed of a disc and release speed.  Wind can alter how a disc's perceived ""speed"" is (headwind = faster disc speed, hence understability.  Tailwind = slower relative speed, meaning overstability).    Snap/induced spin is another one.  It doesn't matter if you can huck a disc 90mph.  If there is no snap on it, it's not going to behave the way it's supposed to.    Disc plastic, weight, and condition are other big factors; if you throw a 165 Pro Boss and a 175 Champ Boss, you're going to get very different results, even if your form was identical on both throws.  It would be nice if there was an easy way to figure it out, but I don't think there is an easy way to translate disc speed into required mph on release.  With that being said, Vibram has a ""required release speed to attain intended disc flight"" on their discs.  http://www.vibramdiscgolf.com/flight-ratings.html.  As if to prove my point.. I have a Sole (putter), a Trak (fairway) and a Lace (driver) in front of me, and they're all listed as 50mph discs."
discgolf,3drmsf,GetStable,2,Sat Jul 18 20:23:41 2015 UTC,Originally Innova rated the disc's speed by the rim width. A Leopard has a rim width of 1.6cm and it is rated speed 6. A Teebird has a rim width of 1.7cm and it is rated speed 7. A Valkyrie has a rim width of 1.9cm and it is rated speed 9. A Beast has a rim width of 2.0cm and it is rated speed 10. A Destroyer has a rim width of 2.2cm and it is rated speed 12.  After awhile they stopped keeping to this standard. What I'm saying is that the correlation was never meant to be to a particular mph per my knowledge
discgolf,3drmsf,Benjamedes,3,Sat Jul 18 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"My apologies if I'm being dense, but I'm having a bit of a Monty Hall Problem moment here.  If the speed number is there to tell you that if you throw it slower or faster than that, you won't get the designed effect; then that means there has to be an acceptable window of speed that will achieve that effect. I know it's not necessarily a direct correlation, but I can't throw a Boss 10mph or a Roc 70mph and expect either to do what they advertise."
discgolf,3drmsf,Benjamedes,0,Sat Jul 18 20:54:44 2015 UTC,True but that doesn't mean there is a direct correlation. The diameter of the disc effects flight characteristics more than just how fast you have to throw it. Nonetheless this is what the speed numbers originally meant
discgolf,3drmsf,Mornos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:17:11 2015 UTC,Can you specify what you want to know? Do you want to know how fast it actually flies or how fast you need to throw the disc so it matches the numbers?
discgolf,3drmsf,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sat Jul 18 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"The latter. If the speed number is the ideal speed with which it needs to be thrown to achieve the disc's intended flight, how fast exactly is a 7, for example?  I know there are tons of other factors - like u/getstable mentions - but there has to be some parallel between a ""13"" and 70mph (...or something...I'm only taking a stab at 70mph because I vaguely remember reading somewhere that that's approximately the top end of a pro's release speed)."

discgolf,3drmsf,rottinguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:12:16 2015 UTC,"About Vibram: if you look at their flight ratings PDF you can see that some fairways require higher MPH releases than some drivers, and actually it looks like the disc that requires the highest MPH release is a putter."
discgolf,3drmsf,M0b1u5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:58:31 2015 UTC,Speed is just a measurement of how thick the rim of the disc is. Higher speed = thicker rim.

Also your weight is not on your front foot. (your right one in this case) You should shift your weight from the left to the right foot during your throw and then come around with your left leg. You do come around but because there is no weight shift it seems like you are almost falling over. There is obviously a lot more, but I think those are the most important things you can work on as your next step.  Apart from that your throw looks controlled and good. Keep going and you will soon throw some nice shots :)  Also it´s better to upload the videos to youtube because you can slow them down there which makes it easier to see your form."

discgolf,3dr3j8,Mornos,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"Basics are everything! :D No matter what you work on, always incorporate only one thing at once in your throw. If you change too much stuff old mistakes my come back or you make some new mistakes."

Also I don't think they make Star Teebird3s unless its a factory store thing. Star Wraiths are nice, even nicer once they beat in a little.   One of the interesting things about Innova and mids is that IMO they don't make that many great out of the box understable mids. Almost every Innova pro just throws beat up Rocs/Roc3s. I throw P-line MD3s which are very similar.   As for the Pig, they're a pretty good utility disc, I've just never been a fan. (don't hurt me, /u/durkaflurkaflame)"

discgolf,3dqb2d,Haru2,7,Sat Jul 18 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"He has been blowing through them but it may be somewhat of a misnomer. Usually when someone runs through sponsors it is because they are unruly or hard to manage, i think Nikko truly just doesnt put much stock in a sponsor like other golfers. Even when he first went pro he was  the only top pro able to throw any mold he wanted, because his gateway sponsorship allowed him to throw whatever he wanted. Other companies aren't nearly as accepting of that like gateway was. And other golfers move from company to company completely retolling their bag to use only their sponsor's discs. I think Nikko just wants to throw every company's discs and he hasn't found a sponsor who will accept that like gateway did."
discgolf,3dqb2d,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. When Nikko broke out on the pro scene he was basically winning everything. Nikko was Mcbeth before Mcbeth was, he won almost everything except worlds for those couple years it felt like. So I think he was very firm when negotiating contracts that he doesn't want to mess with his bag and I think he has just kind of stuck to that this whole time. That's just my theory anyway, but he seems like the kind of guy that doesn't really care about wearing some sponsors shirt just for the fuck of it."

It just seemed to me that Nikko liked some of their discs, and they gave him some discs and maybe a little something extra to promote the company. But this isn't a McBeth/Innova or Schusterick/Prodigy kind of thing. Nikko never seemed to ""represent"" the brand.   I don't think anything has really changed. This is like a little tempest in a thimble."

Not only that, I have designed several stamps & logos for various tournaments all for free.  So while I didn't buy any particular basket, I feel a bit of 'ownership', and think it's fine to sign a basket.  Later on when you're playing a round, you can see that 'Jonny two fingers' aced this hole on xx date and congratulate (or give him shit) about the ace"
discgolf,3drczd,SteveDart,3,Sun Jul 19 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"But what about when someone comes along and scrawls ""Fag Team MVP"" with an arrow pointing to Johnny's name? You have to draw the line somewhere. Allowing a select group to write on the baskets while others are prohibited is easily the fastest way to get your course trashed.   And it's all good and well to say you've earned the right to signify your aces in the equipment. But unless you are there 24/7 policing who gets to write on them, then it doesn't matter. Some casuals who hit a lucky ace could write over your name."
discgolf,3drczd,Emerald_Triangle,-8,Sun Jul 19 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"someone comes along and scrawls ""Fag Team MVP""   you'll never get rid of jackasses"
discgolf,3drczd,SteveDart,2,Sun Jul 19 02:37:59 2015 UTC,"Well that's pretty much my entire point; to a jackass, or a casual, they don't care or even realize that someone has dedicated time to installing and maintaining the course. They see vandalism and take that as a cue to join in. You can't allow selective markings because it endorses any markings. You are basically arguing, ""I can litter because I clean up the course."" But I know you don't litter because you care for the course. Show it the same respect as it applies to vandalism and all you can hope for is for other players to follow suit."
discgolf,3drczd,Emerald_Triangle,-9,Sun Jul 19 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"You are basically arguing, ""I can litter because I clean up the course.""   not even close - no one endorses littering ... even if they OWNED the course.  In my opinion, singing an ace on a number plate is not 'vandalism'  c'mon - don't throw up strawmen"
discgolf,3drczd,SteveDart,2,Sun Jul 19 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"By the letter of the law, you're committing vandalism when you mark your ace on the basket. As u/Oglshrub said, your club may have funded the basket and you may have personally installed it, but it falls under ownership of the municipality once you put it on the public course. You pretty much donated the equipment to the city. So it doesn't really matter that you don't believe you are committing vandalism, because you are defacing public property. Like another poster said, you and your group can sign your disc and I bet you could even post a photo on the message board at hole 1, but writing on baskets/benches/signs/tables/trashcans/trees/teepads/etc with permanent marker should be unacceptable. You're free to feel however you want, but I can guarantee you that you won't stop vandalism on your course as long as you and your friends are writing on baskets."

discgolf,3dt884,DylThomps,7,Sun Jul 19 05:50:50 2015 UTC,"I putt with a stiff putter, I don't put much stock in ""gripping the chains,"" and things like roll aways are user error.   It all comes down to the way the disc feels in your hand, your confidence with it, and how you throw it.   I've seen great putting with Champ Rhynos, super stiff Wizards, and MVP Ions. I've also seen all kinds of discs hit chains or even bounce out of the bottom of the basket and roll (that was funny).   Over the years, I've learned that it's more about how you throw it than what the putter is. You don't need the putter to grab the chains, because when it goes in, you threw it in. I acknowledge that there's a slight benefit to a grippy putter hitting the chains, but in my experience that benefit is so minimal and pales so totally in comparison to the benefit that technique brings you, that it is negligible. So on balance, you will improve more by getting better at putting than you will by finding the absolute grippiest of putters.  So my advice is to find a putter that feels good and go at it until you are totally confident. Confidence is 100x more important than whatever plastic your putter is in, or even what mold it is.  I went through a long time just dreading to putt. I'd literally worry about it all before, during, and after the putt. And I was a terrible putter. Finally I realized some key things: you have to pick a link of the chains and throw at that link; putting actually isn't that hard; putting is kind of like a minigame within the full game - have fun with it. Once I realized those things, I became a much more confident putter.  So my advice is to pick a putter, whatever it is, that feels good in your hand (this may take a bit) whether you believe it will grip the chains or not. And stick with it. Throw lots of putts and try to love putting.  Putters you might look at: Aviar (any flavor), Challenger, Magnet, Judge, Pure, Ion, Anode, Envy, Harp, Wizard, Voodoo, Magic, PA3, PA4, PA1, Clozer - the sky is the limit. Get 2 or 3 of any of these (or any other putter on the market really) and go to town."

Everyone else just gave their opinion of a great putter. While that's cool and you can take ideas from it, I would go to the biggest disc golf shop near you. Take literally every type of putter they have, and throw them all. You'll find one that just clicks and you say, wow this feels really nice in my hand and leaving my hand. Then buy it. If they don't have a basket in the shop bring a friend and have them catch for you, and so the same for them if they don't have a putter."

It would be easy to add/subtract based on the number of discs you want to carry around.  I just use the one.. and it's half full of discs to give away to new players, with the other half being trade discs or stuff to swap into my bag."

discgolf,3drmsf,e8odie,6,Sat Jul 18 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"There isn't a direct correlation to the speed of a disc and release speed.  Wind can alter how a disc's perceived ""speed"" is (headwind = faster disc speed, hence understability.  Tailwind = slower relative speed, meaning overstability).    Snap/induced spin is another one.  It doesn't matter if you can huck a disc 90mph.  If there is no snap on it, it's not going to behave the way it's supposed to.    Disc plastic, weight, and condition are other big factors; if you throw a 165 Pro Boss and a 175 Champ Boss, you're going to get very different results, even if your form was identical on both throws.  It would be nice if there was an easy way to figure it out, but I don't think there is an easy way to translate disc speed into required mph on release.  With that being said, Vibram has a ""required release speed to attain intended disc flight"" on their discs.  http://www.vibramdiscgolf.com/flight-ratings.html.  As if to prove my point.. I have a Sole (putter), a Trak (fairway) and a Lace (driver) in front of me, and they're all listed as 50mph discs."
discgolf,3drmsf,GetStable,2,Sat Jul 18 20:23:41 2015 UTC,Originally Innova rated the disc's speed by the rim width. A Leopard has a rim width of 1.6cm and it is rated speed 6. A Teebird has a rim width of 1.7cm and it is rated speed 7. A Valkyrie has a rim width of 1.9cm and it is rated speed 9. A Beast has a rim width of 2.0cm and it is rated speed 10. A Destroyer has a rim width of 2.2cm and it is rated speed 12.  After awhile they stopped keeping to this standard. What I'm saying is that the correlation was never meant to be to a particular mph per my knowledge
discgolf,3drmsf,Benjamedes,3,Sat Jul 18 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"My apologies if I'm being dense, but I'm having a bit of a Monty Hall Problem moment here.  If the speed number is there to tell you that if you throw it slower or faster than that, you won't get the designed effect; then that means there has to be an acceptable window of speed that will achieve that effect. I know it's not necessarily a direct correlation, but I can't throw a Boss 10mph or a Roc 70mph and expect either to do what they advertise."
discgolf,3drmsf,Benjamedes,0,Sat Jul 18 20:54:44 2015 UTC,True but that doesn't mean there is a direct correlation. The diameter of the disc effects flight characteristics more than just how fast you have to throw it. Nonetheless this is what the speed numbers originally meant
discgolf,3drmsf,Mornos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:17:11 2015 UTC,Can you specify what you want to know? Do you want to know how fast it actually flies or how fast you need to throw the disc so it matches the numbers?
discgolf,3drmsf,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sat Jul 18 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"The latter. If the speed number is the ideal speed with which it needs to be thrown to achieve the disc's intended flight, how fast exactly is a 7, for example?  I know there are tons of other factors - like u/getstable mentions - but there has to be some parallel between a ""13"" and 70mph (...or something...I'm only taking a stab at 70mph because I vaguely remember reading somewhere that that's approximately the top end of a pro's release speed)."

discgolf,3drmsf,M0b1u5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:58:31 2015 UTC,Speed is just a measurement of how thick the rim of the disc is. Higher speed = thicker rim.
discgolf,3dr2lw,rarecare,6,Sat Jul 18 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"So, it depends on the level of sponsorship.  The top pros have a bonus schedule based on how they finish at events.  Finish first in a C-Tier might be worth $150, while finishing first at an A-Tier might be worth $1,000.  This goes for all of their sponsors.  So, when that A-Tier is won, the player might collect $1,500 from Innova, $1,000 from Grip, $750 from their clothing sponsor, etc.    I've also heard before that some sponsors will match what you win.  So, if the purse is $2,500, you will earn $2,500 from the sponsor.  This seems good because it pushes players into the highest paying events.  It benefits the players, and the TD's.  I think there's probably a number of guys making better than $50k these days.  I think McBeth, Ricky, Will Schusterick, are all making good money as compared to all fields.

Also your weight is not on your front foot. (your right one in this case) You should shift your weight from the left to the right foot during your throw and then come around with your left leg. You do come around but because there is no weight shift it seems like you are almost falling over. There is obviously a lot more, but I think those are the most important things you can work on as your next step.  Apart from that your throw looks controlled and good. Keep going and you will soon throw some nice shots :)  Also it´s better to upload the videos to youtube because you can slow them down there which makes it easier to see your form."

When I am making all my putts in the circle, staying out of OB, and generally playing solid, mistake-free golf, it feels normal.  Like.. this is what I should be doing every time.  It's the missed putts, bad upshots, and shanked drives that hurt.    It's all subjective, too.  If I make a handful of 30-40' putts in a round, I feel pretty good, whereas that's normal for better players.  I think that this mindset kind of proves that the game is so ingrained in players.. there are often so many more lows to a round than there are highs, and yet we keep going out every day, trying to find that high while minimizing the numbers of lows."

I know that I'm capable of Advanced-rated rounds.  I know that I'm capable of putting together whole, Advanced-rated tournaments.  When I play to that ability, it feels natural.  Everything is clicking and it doesn't feel forced.  I might get a bit excited about it, but otherwise I'm just along for the ride.  But when I'm playing 920 or worse golf, it feels terrible.  I'm missing putts and I know it's hurting my scores.  I'm shanking my drives and I know it's forcing me to scramble more than I want.  All these things build and build until you're looking at an emotionally crushing round.

Same story at GBO, shot what I though would be a half decent round and ended being 3rd out of 168.  Simon's quote pairs well with the idea that the Pro's don't birdie every hole, they just don't bogey very often.

Usually when someone runs through sponsors it is because they are unruly or hard to manage, i think Nikko truly just doesnt put much stock in a sponsor like other golfers. Even when he first went pro he was  the only top pro able to throw any mold he wanted, because his gateway sponsorship allowed him to throw whatever he wanted. Other companies aren't nearly as accepting of that like gateway was. And other golfers move from company to company completely retolling their bag to use only their sponsor's discs. I think Nikko just wants to throw every company's discs and he hasn't found a sponsor who will accept that like gateway did."

discgolf,3dr24s,Myspacecutie69,3,Sat Jul 18 17:08:08 2015 UTC,If you like some of the discs you have you could try them in a more premium plastic like star or champ. And I always recommend a Teebird.
discgolf,3dr24s,Auriyon,2,Sat Jul 18 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"Ive been thinking the Teebird3 in Star, a Wraith Star, perhaps a better plastic understable midrange, and Ive been looking at the Blizzard Pig on the innova pro shop site, just for shits and gigs."
discgolf,3dr24s,Auriyon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:51:19 2015 UTC,"I've never been a big fan of the Teebird variants (Teebird3, TL, TL3) - the Teebird is just too good of a disc without changing anything. Also I don't think they make Star Teebird3s unless its a factory store thing. Star Wraiths are nice, even nicer once they beat in a little.   One of the interesting things about Innova and mids is that IMO they don't make that many great out of the box understable mids. Almost every Innova pro just throws beat up Rocs/Roc3s. I throw P-line MD3s which are very similar.   As for the Pig, they're a pretty good utility disc, I've just never been a fan. (don't hurt me, /u/durkaflurkaflame)"

discgolf,3dqzw4,sepia_undertones,4,Sat Jul 18 16:49:04 2015 UTC,"When you practice, don't play ""rounds."" Go out to a field and practice throwing different lines. Throw 20-30 anny's, 20-30 Hyzers, 20-30 b-lines... Etc. As you practice, stick to throwing one set of discs (I.e. work your midrange first, then throw in drivers) to help you better understand your range with each type. Don't worry too much about disc selection for now. Find something that works; your distance and power will improve as you gain finesse and muscle memory.  On putting, establish your routine and execute during rounds how you practice. If you rapid fire during practice, don't take the whole 30 seconds to line up a shot, and visa versa. Also, if you feel yourself getting bored during putting practice, take a break and reestablish concentration before you continue.  Edit: spelling"

You make the five footer, the ten footer, and the fifteen footer, but get nervous as you approach the twenty footer. When you miss, you honestly believe you are worse at making the twenty footer because you forced the perspective that you miss more putts when distance increase."

I had been trying to putt with a Paul Mcbeth style spin/push hybrid and was so inconsistent it was embarrassing. I finally broke down and completely abandoned it. Johne McCray posted a little 1 minute teaser video on Facebook for an upcoming clinic he was going to put on and something just clicked. I adopted his technique, went to his clinic, and started hitting probably more than twice as many putts.  I found this video which covers most of the important points he stressed. I use Legacy Hunter putters in protege plastic and I have never had more confidence."

discgolf,3dp0jd,drummer3543,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:39:28 2015 UTC,I do the spush putt thing that everyone is talking about these days. I also developed a routine. I spent many hours putting when I worked at a disc golf pro shop locally so I developed a consistent routine and stroke that for me has made a huge difference in my putting game. Just make it a consistent routine when you practice and then when you play.
discgolf,3dp0jd,aDramaticPause,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of good technical advice from other users, but I wanted to say two things: Feldberg has a video where he says that driving, flicking and everything else other than putting is form. For the most part everyone with good form throws in a similar way, but with slight variations. Putting is one of those things that there is no perfect form for, but it's more about practice. Never ending practice!  Also, one other tip I have is that when you're practicing putting, only take 2-5 putters. Slowly breathe and put each one like the tourny is on the line, don't just rapid fire them. You'd be practicing the wrong form. Pretend it's for real.  Good luck - I'm constantly battling putting myself (who isn't?) and when you see some more growth it's such a great thing."

Focus in on one single chain link as you exhale with confidence. Clean release with a good ""finger pop"" is the control. Meaning every really good putter has that clean release and pop. Putting is a consistent continual battle. 90% mental."

The side you will use for the rake you need to put pretty long and heavy screws. This is what catches the discs. The holes on the other two sides allow water to enter the pipes to let it sink, and then let the water out to let it drain. tie two long and heavy ropes (100+ feet) to the point opposite the metal rakes.

discgolf,3dpzpm,OGeesus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:00:54 2015 UTC,My guess is you're rounding as you throw. Make sure to pull across your chest. Slow down and work on the proper form.

discgolf,3dpzpm,Murraybird,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:42:17 2015 UTC,"The best piece of advice is to slow your motion down to a snails pace. Focus on throwing with a smooth motion and nose down and you should be able to avoid some of the torque that was likely hurting your shoulder. Then slowly pick up the pace until you figure out your range. I have seen people who legit cant throw more than 100-150 ft because of shoulder and back pain, but its still worth developing for your upshots if you can manage it pain free. If not just remember there are 1030ish pros who use sidearms for nearly every shot, so theres no shame in using only the sidearm."

discgolf,3dpzpm,agoia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"Backhand can't ""pop"" a shoulder. It's the shoulder working naturally.  Do you get shoulder pain at any other time? How old are you?   The reason I ask is that calcification of the Shoulder tendons - in particular the Supra Spinatus is very common in people over 40 years old. It causes extreme pain in the joint.  It's diagnosed easily by X-ray or Ultrasound, and mild cases can sometimes be alleviated by injecting Cortisone and Steroids directly into the tendons via Ultarsound-guided injection - and a needle about 4 inches long.  Severe cases always require arthroscopic surgery, where they puncture the tendon and squeeze it, causing the calcium to ooze out like toothpaste. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV-VxBgUpDE  I had this surgery about 5 years ago, and it was a complete success, and I have zero shoulder pain now. It was so bad that even lifting my arm above my shoulder hurt a lot."

The destoyer, roc, firebird, and teebirds were staples I my bag. At one time I carried 4 destoyers. 3 firebirds, which seems like a lot but one was an 11x champ, one was a light weight star and one was a max weight star (the light weight one has about 6 aces on it). I carried 3 teebirds. I also carried 5 rocs, I had a couple aces with rocs.   I played with a team trilogy player and expressed my interest in the trilogy, he asked what disc I threw the most that day, which was an AJ teebird. He went to his trunk and handed me an opto saint pro. The first couple of throws I had with it I was unsure. But after a few rounds I took out one of my teebirds to have it in there.

Not to mention, it's a way for them to test out livestreaming which we could see more of in the future.

Paul Klee's grasp of color is dumbfounding.  There is a playfulness to every composition that is blown into the realm of the escapist's imagination through his complex palettes that evoke a location and time without ever tracing an artifact.  His similarly playful use in titling his pieces, combined with his love of incorporating words and simple symbols bridge a gap between an adolescent whimsy and a deeper philosophical query.  Why not both?"

I remember the moment it started clicking for me too. I had been playing for over a year casually with some buddies. None of us knew enough about disc golf to know a proper form or what discs to use. Started getting serious eventually and I noticed a massive progression in my game when I started to slow down my throwing motion in an attempt to get more consistent with my release angles. Ended up making everything more consistent.
discgolf,3dob9x,MrFirmHandshake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:39:36 2015 UTC,Time to get practice putting. That's was I realized a year ago when I was in a similar situation as you. Likely have shaved 4 or 5 strokes off my game this year by throwing at least 100 putts a day. But a great side benefit I didn't realize is now I'm less stressed about getting my throw as close as possible to the pin. Just hit the line and get it close enough.

discgolf,3do7jl,threedaysmore,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:10:55 2015 UTC,I lost two Glow MD3s on the same hole at Borderland (a month or so apart). Lost a putting putter off of a cliff. Lost two AJ Teebirds within 3 weeks of each other (no longer throwing those - I can take a hint) and I think...5 Destroyers. And that's about half of them. Its been..interesting.

discgolf,3do7jl,Novaova,3,Fri Jul 17 22:34:48 2015 UTC,"My record is 5 discs in 3 holes. Heat stroke and long grass was involved.  The secret to not losing discs in water is (oddly enough) not to throw them into the water. :P And the way to avoid that is to:  1) Do not aim high. People get scared, and pull their shots high, which stall and fade into the water.  2) Use the straightest discs you can, and keep them low.  3) If you can't do those things, then use floating discs like the (very understable) Innova Dragon, or any Blizzard disc under 140gm (They all float at 139gm and below).  The other big key to not losing discs, is to watch them like a hawk all the way to the bitter end. NEVER EVER turn away from a bad throw! Watch it very carefully, and use triangulation from the tee, to establish where it is.  I wish I had a dollar for every time some muppet turned away from their bad drive, and then started looking 20 metres from where it went in."

discgolf,3do7jl,DrAudiologist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:17:27 2015 UTC,"The solution is quite simple, put a dragon or another floating disc in your bag. Even the wahoo (although inconsistent) would work. Hydra for upshots near water. I play on a course with 8 water hole, 8! So i bag a bunch of floaters and i never lose a disc to water. Its worth it for the casual rounds to be sure."
discgolf,3do7jl,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"Its not that the shots are actually water holes. Its the fact that when you grip lock it and throw it way right on accident, its going in the water. Otherwise if thats the case, Id just need to buy a stack of Wahoo's and Dragons."
discgolf,3do7jl,LeftyHyzer,3,Fri Jul 17 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"The same principle applies. If you have put alot of discs in the water on a certain hole then you need to use a water disc for that hole because it qualifies as a water hole. Or if you are griplocking with that much regularity i would suggest oyu skip a few rounds and hit field instead, preferably with a line to practice throwing straight. But for real though, 90% of the time i hear someone say they wont throw a water disc its ego, because they want the birdie and the water disc isnt as good. Save your plastic for the good holes and tourneys!"

discgolf,3dnzz9,OGeesus,3,Fri Jul 17 20:47:30 2015 UTC,Lakewood - this is the best course near the city. It has a nice mix of open and technical shots. 20 holes.   Seatac - this course is in the flight path for the airport. It is 27 holes and long. Very long. Very well balanced. Bring your forehand game and some serious distance shots.   Auburn - this course is about 30 minutes south of the city and is fairly technical and it runs along the white river.   Ft Steilacoomb - This course is located in the Tacoma area about an hour south and has 2 18 hole courses. Great course.   North Park - this is the only course in the city of Seattle proper. It is tight and crowded. I do not recommend playing here unless you enjoy ducking errant drives.   Terrace creek - north of town in mountlake terrace. This course features a 500 ft top of the world shot on hole 18. Go with a guide it has a confusing layout.

discgolf,3dnzz9,Arctis_Tor,2,Fri Jul 17 22:13:09 2015 UTC,I should add that Lakewood and SeaTac are about 3 miles apart.  You could play a round at both in the same day fairly easily.
discgolf,3dnzz9,BigA5280,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:48 2015 UTC,I am visiting Seattle as I type this and did a bunch of research. I'm staying east of the city and just finished playing tall firs. It was great. There are red and blue tees for most holes. I played two rounds one red and one blue. It really changed the feel of the course. I left 100% satisfied with my choice! If you choose tall firs you will be pleased.  There is you tube footage of tourneys at lakewood and seatac and they both looked sweet too. You can't lose if you head there by the looks of it. Have a great trip!
discgolf,3dnzz9,MattRobertson777,2,Fri Jul 17 22:50:51 2015 UTC,"Tall firs is pretty much a must play, it's in Monroe which is a bit of a drive from Seattle but well worth it. It's the best in the state, a $5 pay to play course that has amazing owners. Free coffee, 3 putting baskets, a driving net, beer for sale on site, a pro shop with trilogy discs, and a bunch of loaner discs you can try out or lend to a friend if they're new. Great layout, and it's one of the few courses out here where you can really just bomb it. Multiple 600 foot holes and a 900ft hole that goes along a lake. So fun.  Additionally I've heard Lakewood is real fun, but haven't played it. I'm more from the northside so I don't know a ton of the courses that are real south.   Also for weekly tourneys, just look for the group ""NW discgolfers"" on Facebook and there's a document listing all the weekly tourneys"

discgolf,3dnzz9,eastlakebikerider,2,Sat Jul 18 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"Tall firs is good, but not the best in the state.  Not by a mile.  You definitely need to get down to Lakewood and Seatac.  And White River and Steilly and Shelton Springs.  You have to check out the courses in Bremerton - Bud Pell and NAD.  And then there's the courses in Spokane - 4 Mounds (3 courses), Highbridge and Sekani.   I'd rate all these courses over Tall Firs."

However what i did find was a large pile of fresh poopy and several cans of open cat food.  Most of it already eaten.   I think I'm going to find a new course."

These people, who I thought were complete assholes, were just doing this guy a favor of not having to dig through a nasty ass garbage can.

Even a full time employee couldn't police all 14 hours of sunlight. Notes are the only way to communicate.  I used to disc a free course in my town in the mornings. People would night disc there and tie glowsticks to the baskets and weave the glow headbands through the chains. Of course, they never picked up after themselves; the people that played in the mornings had to clean up all their trash. Funny enough though, they always seemed to pick up/remove the notes that people left, telling them to pick up after themselves."

discgolf,3dnbxm,AequitasKiller,4,Fri Jul 17 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"When I first started playing one of the local guys said to me ""Throw rollers (RHFH) with your putter to the next teepad as you walk up to it in casual rounds, you never know when you'll need it"" and aside from it being useful it is pretty fun. That's where it all started for me, I moved up from a putter to a mid to a firebird/X1 from there. I have found rollers to be very similar to air shots as far as what stability discs should be used for each. Forehand rollers are better suited for stable to overstable discs and backhand rollers stable to understable. I am a more forehand oriented player and have had great success with rollers because of that. I generally angle my disc at about 45 degrees and try to get it down at an angle like / so it cuts slightly then stands up and goes straight. Generally a more overstable disc will ""cut roll"" and resist turning towards the flight plate and finish right where as a stable disc will stand up straight and eventually curl left and fall over. I suggest trying to throw FH rollers with every disc in your bag so you can witness for yourself how much snap/power it takes for your discs to go straight or how little power you need to successfully cut roll a disc to the right. The forehand roller is one of the best outs in disc golf if you get trapped in the rough and have to choose between a pitch out and getting 50-100 ft up the fairway.  Backhand rollers are a bit tougher in my opinion because there are a lot more moving parts and styles to it. I have seen both hyzerflip rollers as well as traditional angled release rollers both be very successful. I personally recommend throwing an angled release roller with an understable disc as if you were trying to throw a huge flex anny directly into the ground. You will have the most success with a disc that is understable enough that it does not fade at all when released but also stable enough to resist a ""turn and burn"" when it hits the ground. The best backhand roller disc I have come across is the Prodigy F7, it does almost all of the work for you. One of the keys to getting your BH roller off well is lining yourself up to the right side of the teepad and coming across it diagonally to the top left corner as if you were going to throw an anny but leaning back slightly to change the angle of release. I don't recommend hyzerflip rollers because there is too much variance in the angle in which the disc hits the ground. Releasing it on the angle you want and letting it hit the ground and bite is a lot easier to reproduce and adjust."
discgolf,3dnbxm,JimmyDG,2,Fri Jul 17 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"Understable discs are most common for rollers because they're easier to flip.  You can use the same disc for either FH or BH roller shots.   While it's rolling, note the which direction the top of the disc is facing.  That's the direction the disc will finish.  The angle that the disc is rolling at is very important.  You don't want it straight up and down.  Think of a clock  - you want the disc to land and start rolling at 1:00 for FH or 11:00 for BH.  It will take a good deal of field work to get consistent on landing how you want.  For longer rollers, try to maximize the distance the disc is in the air (before it starts rolling).  Think of it this way: your disc will only roll 200'.  You can have it land in 25' in front of you and it will go 225' or you can have it land 100' in front and it will go 300'  (distances are just guesses used for example).  The disc will roll farther if it's spinning faster.  Hope that helps!"
discgolf,3dnbxm,dscgod,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely want something understable so you can get the required flip without having to exaggerate your release angle.  My personal preference is a disc that isn't too domey as well.  Just seems to get a wider, and thus longer, path out of it.  As for RHFH vs RHBH, that depends completely on which direction you want it to curl.  Once it hits the ground it's going to turn in the direction of the top of the disc (assuming you have enough power to overcome the angle it lands on).  To get maximum distance you want the ground equivalent of an S-curve.  So for a RHBH shot you want it to land left of center so the disc first starts curling to the left and then as the momentum turns the disc over it then curls back to the right."
discgolf,3dnbxm,arkiverge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"when i learned to do the roller i just sat at a open hole and just tried to work out my mechanics for it.  I use a Echo Star Roadrunner, beat prodigy D4 and a discraft Xpress for my rollers and where it ends up is all about it's angle and how much spin it has imo.  If you throw it hard as hell but it's at an extreme under angle there is a chance it'll turn and burn and not stand up.  If you throw it too upright it'll fade out early.  Nikko hyzer flips rollers, as does Will, but they throw them at near full speed to do it."
discgolf,3dnbxm,lohkeytx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"I like Sidewinders and Monarchs for my rollers. I go RHBH and come really over the top. I focus a lot on getting a good snap on my release to start the disc rotation off right. I like to think of a table saw blade when it comes off. Rainbow arch that runs once it hits the ground. I've had so a lot of success using this shot on holes with deep tree cover near the pin, but it's rarely my best option.   Hope that helps. It's hard to describe disc golf mechanics..."
discgolf,3dnbxm,RUKnight31,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies.  I think I'm trying to land it too soon, I think I'll just try to release flatter and with more spin so that it turns over where it normally turns after about 100-150 feet.  I'm not too worried about it as this is a shot I'm not going to take often, but it would be nice to have the option to take it.  I guess I'll just have to take to the soccer fields and feel it out the old fashioned way with lots of practice and experimenting."
discgolf,3dnbxm,BmfnT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to suggest something completely opposite of these guys and in no way am I saying they are wrong.  There are many ways to throw a roller. I like to throw a semi-beat star destroyer but I release it on the angle I want it to come down on.  In my opinion, overstable discs will roll further because they fight the low speed finish right. I currently throw around 350 or so in the air but I can roll a destroyer over 400 if the grass is cut.  I will definitely throw an under stable to stable disc for less distance or for a utility shots if the ceiling is low.  Once again, there is no perfect answer.  It's personal preference."

The typical answer would be, if they're too over stable for you now, then maybe they'll be useful once you either learn proper form or they beat in a little bit.    I didn't like my KC pro aviar until it beat in a little bit, and I've been playing one disc rounds with my DX Roc3 so it beats to fill an understable mid spot that I've been wanting to fill. One of my first discs was a echo star Valkyrie that just never flew like I wanted to. (would turn and burn or meat hook)  After a while I decided to stick it in my bag and I got my first ace with it.  (Valley Springs, Durham, NC. Hole 7? the one with the pin on a pile of rocks)"

discgolf,3dnlf0,Ilkq,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:24:50 2015 UTC,I bought a Nova couple weeks back thinking it would be good for practicing form. Well I had grip issues with it since I accidentally gripped a putter different than a driver while driving. Also it revealed my flaws in throwing quite well. Now today I picked it up again and worked on those after in the break thinking what I did wrong and did a huge improvement by only playing with Nova so that was nice. I absolutely love the disc because it is so controllable and flies super straight with high speed.

discgolf,3dnlf0,palfas,-2,Sat Jul 18 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed. You ""grow through"" discs as your power and distance improve.  I remember having my very first Teebird back around 1999, and I could not straighten it out at all.  Same with the Beast. I have long since abandoned Innova - but I have moved through several other discs since then."
discgolf,3dnx0y,1wildturkey,5,Fri Jul 17 20:24:51 2015 UTC,That means it needs more speed/power to fly its true flight path.  a slower speed disc requires less speed/power to fly true
discgolf,3dnx0y,maxdnd,2,Fri Jul 17 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"It may not exactly be right, but this is how I see the speed number as well.  The higher the number, the faster you have to throw the disc for it to perform as the numbers say it will. Let's say the two discs have a -3 turn rating. You will have to throw a speed 13 disc a lot faster than you would a speed 9 disc in order to get that turn out of it."
discgolf,3dnx0y,jawnnyp,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"Essentially it comes down to consistency, which is something people usually set aside in their brain in comparison to distance. A faster disc will be extremely inconsistent for a new player. Also without the ability to throw it correctly it will fade MUCH faster. If i throw an ape with good arm speed it will for (for example sake only) fly 350 feet and then begin to fade. With a slower arm speed it would fly 200 feet and then begin to fade. Discs fade more as they slow down, so if you throw a disc fast it will take a while to slow down and then fade off, giving you a consistent line. If however you throw it slow it will begin to fade sooner because it will slow down sooner, giving you a meathook shaped shot rather than a straight shot with a gradual fade.    Some players can take advantage of this early fade, and of course it is a necessary shot for some courses/situation. however being able to throw consistently straight is the best way to shave strokes off your game as a beginner, and high speed discs make this very difficult."
discgolf,3dnx0y,LeftyHyzer,2,Fri Jul 17 20:34:57 2015 UTC,I don't like the term speed for a disc; it's misleading.    Think of it as power instead.  It's the relative power you need to throw that disc for it to achieve its other flight characteristics.
discgolf,3dnx0y,dscgod,2,Fri Jul 17 21:10:37 2015 UTC,This. Speed = power required to yield the flight numbers.
discgolf,3dnx0y,bentoboxing,2,Sat Jul 18 07:02:27 2015 UTC,"You arm speed is correlated to the discs speed. It's more of a power rating.  If you can get a 7 speed disc up to speed 7 it will mimic it's exact flight path within reason.  If you throw lesser power than your discs speed it will act more over stable and dump/fade on your earlier.  If you throw and understable disc less than it's speed number, it will resist the turn and sometimes even just glide straight and than fade out."
discgolf,3dnx0y,V0ogurt,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"In laymans terms, for a discs' flight to mimic it's flight numbers, you have to throw it the indicated speed. A Vulcan will only fly 13|5|-4|2 if you have the power to throw it at a 13 speed. If you can only get half that power, it will fly out straight and fade to the left.   So to relate it to overstable discs, (which is less noticeable, overstable discs are always going to fade left) the lower the speed the longer the disc will fly straight before fading out, granted they have identical glide, turn, and fade ratings. If you throw both a Firebird and an Ape at a 9 speed, the Ape will fade out earlier. If you throw both a Firebird and an Ape at a 13 speed, the Firebird will fly out straighter longer than the Ape will. What disc will suit you and your arm speed better is totally up to you."
discgolf,3dnx0y,MrFirmHandshake,2,Fri Jul 17 22:10:53 2015 UTC,"It's been answered, but simply put:  A faster disc will need a faster release speed to perform it's advertised flight path. They might both say the same fade/turn/flight path but the faster disc is over a longer distance. If your arm speed only gets you out to 280-300 you're better off with a disc(speed) that will give you true, consistent flight. Faster discs thrown underpowered won't fly as well, or as consistent."
discgolf,3dnx0y,TreeEyedRaven,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:51 2015 UTC,The fade kind of scales with speed if you get it. If a disc has higher speed it generally requires more speed to fly like it is meant to be thrown.
discgolf,3dnx0y,Ilkq,2,Sat Jul 18 00:23:58 2015 UTC,"If only Innova had called the first number ""Power"" instead of speed.  I wish I had a dollar for each new player who has turned up with an Ape, or a Boss, or soemthing similar. All those people bought it, saying ""It was the fastest speed, and I thought that was good"".  In my role as Wholesaler and retailer, I supply discs with one of three stickers - Green, Blue and Red. The store has a wall chart with the following on it.  Green: Putters and Easy-to-Throw Midranges for beginners, Intermediates and Advanced players.  Blue: Midranges and fairway drivers for intermediates and advanced players.  Red: High Power Drivers for Advanced players ONLY.

Have fun.  Don't pay attention to how well anyone else is doing.  Watch their shots so you can help spot for discs, play to have fun before you play to win and just get to know people and the sport.  There are so many things you can take away from a tournament that are better than a trophy and some cash or plastic.  Don't get me wrong, those things are nice.  Basically competition is more a head game and battle with yourself than it is other players.  Most of them will be facing the same struggle.  So fuck it.  Just go have a good time and enjoy the experience."

discgolf,3dm6v7,DuggleAss,2,Fri Jul 17 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"Are there different divisions?  I imagine being a ""Mini"" tournament there is not.  Still.  My experience with leagues and tournaments is that they are more fun when you go there for fun.  I am very competitive.  I just remember that competition is no fun when I am just getting down on myself.  I see people rage quit, throw discs, kick bags and I wonder why they even show up.    Just relax.  Make new friends.  Have a good time.  Everything good beyond that is sprinkles on your sundae."

I'm decent, but...I'm not sure. It's in the morning too, so I doubt the traditional tall boy and a flask will fly, either.  Not to mention, the first damn tee has a lake shot 250 feet to clear.

I don't play those tournaments.  I love playing a tournament.  I go in paying my money fully expecting I will not ever see it again, or any prizes to compensate.    If you're really nervous, then I think the better way to go is to join a league.  The competition is less, and often they have handicaps.  So really you're only playing to beat yourself."

Most of all try to relax and have fun! Tournaments aren't that much different from casual rounds, especially if you get to play with people you know. I was dreadful in my first tournament. I finished second or third to last in rec division in a local bid. I don't think you can do a whole lot worse than that :)"

Just play smart, have fun, try to take something away from it. If you learn even one thing to make yourself a better player and you had any fun at all it was a major win.  No one expects anyone to do well the first time they try to compete in anything. Hold yourself to that same standard.  Good luck (to us both!)"

If you've got Facebook check out the Silicon Valley Disc Golf Club page or the Bay Area Chain Smokers page and you can find some people to play with. Really active DG community out here filled with great people.  Parque de la Raza (or raza for short) is also a really challenging 9 hole course that's super fun to play. There is a short drive (or even shorter illegal walk across a creek) to get from there to Hellyer which is also pretty fun. Both of those are about 10 minutes past Kelley park. If you get a chance to make it up to SF you should definitely hit up golden gate park, a truly awesome course. And if you can take a 45 minute trip down to Santa Cruz you can play Delaveaga, which is absolutely excellent.  Best of luck!"

discgolf,3dl9la,Saloh,2,Fri Jul 17 05:03:14 2015 UTC,It's comparable to champ v star plastic for innova.
discgolf,3dl9la,IHHU,3,Fri Jul 17 05:09:04 2015 UTC,"I think the stability of Opto and Gold Line are a little closer together than Champ and Star, but Gold Line is definitely more understable than Opto. Can't go wrong with either one."
discgolf,3dl9la,disc_addict,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"True. Also, you tend to find lighter weights in GL, as low as 162, which will be quite a bit less beefy than a 176 Opto. With a variety of weights, plastics, and degrees of wear, you can cover a LOT of shots with the River. Great disc indeed."

discgolf,3dl9la,h0nkus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:36:50 2015 UTC,I've found i am flipping the disk too often. IE the thing starts going right and never comes  back (RHBH) . I've been throwing distance drivers for years.  First fairway driver ive had in bag in forever.   Am i throwing it too hard?
discgolf,3dl9la,CorneliusNepos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I throw Rivers and it can be tough for me to find one that's as stable as I like. Then again, you might be throwing with some off axis torque (i.e. rolling your wrist or putting unintentional anny on the disc).   Can you absolutely not avoid it going to the right? If so, it's your form. Can you throw it on a hyzer line at any distance (i.e. 300' or so) and have it hold the line throughout the flight of the disc? If so, you might need a more stable River.  I throw them max weight, stiff, and domey, and they are stable with a decent fade out to 350' to 375'. Flat, flexy, light weight Rivers require serious babying to get that far for the line I'm looking for."

Crazy elevation changes, crazy shrubbery, technical nonsense, fairly intense hiking.  It was still fun but it took us almost all day to play and we lost a couple of discs in the process.  There was a group of dudes that we caught up to on hole 3 or 4 and we played with them until they gave up on hole 8.  They didn't bring any water or snacks or anything and they were completely overwhelmed by how difficult it was.  If you want a ridiculous DG challenge that really is ""extreme disc golf"" like OP said, you should definitely play here."

discgolf,3dk3jc,fracdoctal,10,Thu Jul 16 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is why they TURN (at least partly, coupled with aero-foil properties).  Discs fade due to gyroscopic precession.  But, still relevant and interesting application to disc sports.  EDIT:  Read the other posts by /u/DinoPhysics below for more complete information."
discgolf,3dk3jc,SearchingforSilky,12,Thu Jul 16 22:31:27 2015 UTC,"Neither statement is entirely accurate. The Magnus effect has almost nothing to do with turn or fade. Both turn and fade are governed by gyroscopic precession.  What you're missing though is that precession is not something gyroscopes inherently do, but a response to external torques not acting in parallel to the axis of rotation. In the case of flying discs, the external torque comes from the net aerodynamic forces. Without gyroscopic stabilization, a disc thrown forwards would very quickly flip either nose up or nose down. Nose up torque => axis of rotation precesses clockwise from RHBH thrower's view => fade. Nose down torque => axis of rotation precesses counterclockwise from RHBH thrower's view => turn.  When a disc is at full speed, the lift it generates will tend to align the airflow with the plane of the disc, and the particulars of the airfoil will determine whether that center of pressure is to the rear of the disc (HS turn), in the center (neutral-stable), or in the front (super overstable). However, as the disc slows down, it will lose lift and start to sink. Sinking means the airflow is now rushing up at the disc, tending to push the nose up no matter what the shape of the disc. This is why all discs fade the same direction if thrown flat and too slow to generate lift.  If you have a nice neutral-stable disc like a Teebird and can really rip it out far and flat, watch the tilt and altitude of the disc. It will almost always start losing altitude first before it actually fades out left (again assuming RHBH)."
discgolf,3dk3jc,DinoPhysics,0,Fri Jul 17 00:57:39 2015 UTC,"First, I understand that precession is the event that occurs when a gyroscope begins to slow down.  There is neutrality, and decay, right?  Withdrawn.  As to the Magnus effect, isn't this where the whole, ""varied wing speed"" thing comes into play.  It is credited for a significant piece of high speed turn.  That seems equivalent to the forces we see here, right?  The fact that the leading edge is moving into the wind, and the following edge is moving with the wind changes the coefficient of lift, which seems to be an analogous force as what s applied to the basketball in the video.    I also have understood that the gyroscope actually fights turn, seeing that it either craves stability or precession.  But, maybe I'm reading you wrong here.  Also, fwiw, I totally agree with the rest of what you wrote, and find myself making all the same arguments.  You seem well thought out and knowledgable, which is validating to me.  Those posts I made are a simplification extreme enough to be inaccurate, and I appreciate the complete explanation you provided, with the caveats mentioned above (of which I am curious of your impression)."
discgolf,3dk3jc,SearchingforSilky,4,Fri Jul 17 02:22:23 2015 UTC,"The ""varied wing speed"" explanation of turn is just wrong. The fact that one side of the disc is spinning into the wind and one side is spinning with the wind will have some effect on the boundary layer, but experimental tests have shown this affects how far left or right the center of lift is relatively little. Observationally, note that if the left side of the disc had significantly more lift, this would actually cause the disc to pop nose up. This is the reason skip shots work - when the left wing of the disc skims the ground, the ground pushes up on the left wing, causing the disc to tilt nose up and get a bit more air (see: Bill Nye clip with crappy audio).  The gyroscopic effects aren't really fighting turn or fade. They fight any torques that would change the axis of rotation, the most significant of which are nose up or nose down torques. As a consequence of fighting those nose up or nose down torques, the disc either precesses into the fade or into the turn - both turn and fade are examples of precession! The reason fighting the nose up or down torque is so important is that without gyroscopic stabilization they are unstable equilibria - throwing a disc with zero spin quickly results in it flipping end over end either nose up or nose down. (Quick caveat, yes, greater angular momentum does change the rate of precession, but it doesn't change whether a disc is tilting to the left or right or holding it's angle.)"
discgolf,3dk3jc,DinoPhysics,3,Fri Jul 17 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome explanation.  Another way to debunk the misconception is to point out that the Magnus effect scales according to cylinder height, so with most golf discs being under one inch tall the effect would be hard to observe.  I found a nice diagram that illustrates center of lift and precession.  I also like the following demonstration:   Spin a disc clockwise (i.e. RHBH) on your finger. Lightly tap the top of the disc a few inches in front of the center; notice that as the nose pitches down, the right wing drops down (simulates center of lift behind the center of gravity - i.e high speed 'turn'). Now, lightly tap the disc a few inches behind the center; notice that as the nose pitches up, the left wing drops down (simulates C.O.L in front of the C.O.G - i.e. low speed 'fade')"
discgolf,3dk3jc,deathputt4birdie,2,Fri Jul 17 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"Yup.  The ""varied wind speed"" comes from a misinterpretation that a spinning disc acts like a spinning propeller, like a helicopter. When a helicopter is flying with a forward velocity, the advancing blade (left side if the blades are spinning clockwise, as seen from above) will see the incoming air as the rotor speed plus the helicopter speed. The retreating blade will see the incoming air as the rotor speed minus the helicopter speed.  However, this has nothing to do with discs. In a helicopter, the advancing blade is an independent airfoil from the retreating blade. In a disc, the left side and right side are part of the same, round solid. The aerodynamic force on a disc is almost the same whether a disc is rotating CW, CCW, or not rotating at all.  Once a spinning disc starts flying, the center of lift moves forward or backward along the centerline of the disc. When the center of lift is behind the center of the disc, gyroscopic precession will revolve that force 90deg in the direction of the spin and produce turn. When the center of lift is in front of the center of the disc, gyroscopic precession will produce fade.  The Magnus Effect is essentially zero for a disc. The larger your side area, the bigger the Magnus force. A disc has an extremely small side area. Any force created from the Magnus effect will be overshadowed by the aerodynamic and gyroscopic forces.  I always go back to this clip from Smarter Every Day. When the force (lift) is applied to the back of the disc, what would normally push the disc nose down pushes the disc roll right instead."

In other words, we haven't seen anything yet; the kids who are 10 and 12 years old now, and watching McBeth, will easily be exceeding McBeths current ability by the time they reach 20 years old.   But, the key to success is, as it always has been - and always will be, the mental game. And it is far harder for a younger player to maintain a cool head when things turn to custard.  I know a young guy who I am sure, could become one of the world's best disc golfers. He just had his 15th birthday. He has a truly amazing talent which Feldberg was quick to recognise when he was here in February, and yet when things don't go his way, he can't shake it off, and get over it.  I do think it is genuinely harder to win the mental game than the physical one, but of course you need a world-class physical game, too!"

discgolf,3dl0y2,valetdude,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:56 2015 UTC,I love my banshees. I find myself reaching for them more and more recently
discgolf,3dl0y2,TheBilbOno,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:19 2015 UTC,I've never been recommended the Banshee. Thank you.   I see it has a rating of 3 glide. How accurate do you find that? Low glide is why my Firebird is not satisfactory in this category either.
discgolf,3dl0y2,lysdexicllama,2,Fri Jul 17 04:40:19 2015 UTC,The new-ish Spark is also basically a Banshee
discgolf,3dl0y2,Dub_D83,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think it's a better banshee. I needed a fairway for the wind that wasn't Firbird/XXX overstable and it seems to fit the role well."
discgolf,3dl0y2,valetdude,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:58:43 2015 UTC,I find it to be pretty accurate however it still gets great controlled distance regardless. It's worth picking one up or finding someone who will let you throw it a couple times.
discgolf,3dl0y2,BgGrlsDontCry,7,Fri Jul 17 05:06:18 2015 UTC,"In my experience the Stag is no where close to the flight numbers. The Stag is considerably more understable than a Teebird, and light years away from the stability of a Thunderbird.  A Thunderbird truly is a faster Teebird. At 425' feet of power a Thunderbird will hold a straight line with a strong finish. If you have a slower arm, I'd recommend trying a lighter weight. The max weight champs are quite overstable at lower speeds."
discgolf,3dl0y2,QuixoticHornet,2,Fri Jul 17 04:10:49 2015 UTC,I concur. Stags beat in fast and become understable quickly while thunderbirds are considerably more beefy.
discgolf,3dl0y2,Ayrex,2,Fri Jul 17 04:30:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing your experience. Much appreciated.   Disappointed to hear that the numbers are incorrect on the Stag. I have heard that westside numbers seem to be a little off.
discgolf,3dl0y2,The_Dancing_Lobsters,3,Fri Jul 17 04:42:04 2015 UTC,"You might try a Westside Boatman. It's speed 11 so it's considerably faster than a Thunderbird but it probably has the most consistent flight numbers of all westside discs. It's extremely predictable, without too much fade and it has the crazy euro glide. I absolutely love mine in TP plastic, but it's breaking in to be a bit flippy so VIP plastic might be better based on what you're looking for."
discgolf,3dl0y2,ern19,2,Fri Jul 17 04:44:58 2015 UTC,"Most westside discs aren't true to the flight numbers. I've heard its because they're tested way north where the air pressure and altitude make the disc act different. I'd go with a Thunderbird, although another one you might want to consider is the Saint Pro."
discgolf,3dl0y2,fsnzr_,2,Fri Jul 17 04:56:21 2015 UTC,Seconding the Saint Pro suggestion. Super controllable.
discgolf,3dl0y2,The_Dancing_Lobsters,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:31 2015 UTC,flight numbers aren't true here in the north either. You usually get close if you subtract one from the turn number for VIP and maybe more for tournament plastic

discgolf,3dl0y2,iSeeth,2,Fri Jul 17 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"The Stag is one of my very favorite discs and I highly recommend that you get one , but it won't be very overstable. When new it will be straight with a nice, predictable fade. I've never tried a Saint Pro, but I think that would be a great option for you."
discgolf,3dl0y2,DayKid2,2,Fri Jul 17 05:20:52 2015 UTC,Get a Westside Sampo if you want something with the stability of the Thunderbird but in the Westside plastic.  The Sampo won't be available outside of the Trilogy Challenge but I'm sure you can find one for sale on eBay if you can't wait the two months until release.
discgolf,3dl0y2,lysdexicllama,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"Second this. Try to make a trilogy challenge and test out the sampo. For me, it flies very similar to a teebird but glides past the distance I usually get with the teebird and has a soft fade at the end. I can't wait to cop one in VIP when it comes out because I can't stand elasto."
discgolf,3dl0y2,TheBilbOno,2,Fri Jul 17 16:27:53 2015 UTC,The DD Convict is amazing. It'll pop up from a hyzer and sail a long way before fading. A flat release yields a slight S flight. I was gettind these flights at 400' or so
discgolf,3dl0y2,cptengoat70,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"Haven't thrown a thunderbird, but I've heard they're pretty overstable. Like a glidier pd. I did bag a stag for a while in VIP plastic for a while. It was max weight, and definitely not like the ratings suggested. It flies pretty straight for me, even with a little turn. Personally I would say a pd. by far my favorite disc. New c-line pds start out pretty overstable (the most of all the plastics) but beat in to pretty straight flyers. I would probably recommend an s-line pd to start out"

I used to throw the Stag, and everyone's right - the flight numbers do not reflect reality for most folks. For me, I found it to be much more of a stable disc than the 8/6/0/3 indicated."
discgolf,3dl0y2,Monkeypawdog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"If you want someone more overstable than a teebird try an fd2 from discmania. Banshee wing, it's a great disc.  If you want something like a longer teebird, a thunderbird would work, but so would a PD. A PD is more stable than a thunderbird but a Thunderbird is still plenty stable. PD is a 10 4 0 3, one of my favorite discs."

discgolf,3dksw2,sparks44,2,Fri Jul 17 22:24:33 2015 UTC,"Get some money together and buy some bag tags. This is a fun reason for the club to meet up once or twice a week and play against each other. When each member of the club signs up to pay dues, they get a tag. Basically the tags are numbered, and the higher the number the higher your ranking within the club. To do this, invite everyone out for a tag match, gather everyone's tags and maybe a dollar or two to put towards an ace pool/course upkeep, split everyone up evenly on cards, have them keep score, then redistribute tags accordingly."
discgolf,3dksw2,sparks44,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:38:17 2015 UTC,We're for sure going to invest in some bag tags (make them apart of the dues). I really like this idea but what happens when not everyone can attend? College kids have pretty busy schedules.

discgolf,3dksw2,FelBanana17,2,Mon Jul 20 13:05:57 2015 UTC,My preliminary thought would be to raise some funds and get some discs with a club stamp on them.

And a stag for forehand   And you can never go with a nice overstable Roc3
discgolf,3dkv9s,fuzzygreenpanda,3,Fri Jul 17 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"You definitely could benefit from having a stronger midrange selection. I find midrange a to be the most important shots of my game. They fix bad drives, get around obstacles, and set up your putt.   Others mentioned it's great to have a nice overstable disc like the Roc. Totally agree. It's great to have the predictability. Also get something more understable for the same reason, just when you're on the other side of things. I'd recommend the Tursas (Westside). Great disc. Easy to throw. Anhyzer shots can become very useful, especially if you don't have a forehand, like myself."

Since a beat in DX Teebird flew stable with small fade at the end, then the new one will definitely fly straight, with less turn and with a stronger, more pronounced fade at the end...until you hit a couple of trees."

discgolf,3dl0qf,imfinallyhere,2,Fri Jul 17 03:12:09 2015 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/3dk3jc/why_discs_fade_explained/ct5wwj5  This comment chain has some interesting discussion about this.
discgolf,3dl0qf,Swyse,-2,Fri Jul 17 05:08:56 2015 UTC,"No.  The ball is actually developing lift, and flying like a really poor wing, with a terrible glide ratio - due to it's backspin. But a ball never flies like a disc, as balls can't precess as they have no gyroscopic stability.  What causes disc to turn right is that above a certain speed the center of lift moves left across the disc by just a couple of millimetres. There's a tipping point of airspeed, below which a disc won't turn over, and above which it will.  This is why newbies really struggle with hyzer-flipping understable high speed drivers: their throwing speed is not consistently fast enough to flip a disc over, and/or their hyzer release angle is not accurate enough.  You have to know how fast the wind is traveling and in what direction, and be able to do some basic vector maths in your head, to establish how much a disc is going to flip. Then you have to know the wind gradient at altitude so you can allow for it, and also allow for headwind/tailwind changes to disc stability...  This is why Disc Golf is so much more complicated than ball golf. But we're holding the ball, so we progress so much faster."
discgolf,3djkyi,CthulhuConCarne,2,Thu Jul 16 20:07:48 2015 UTC,sweet bag.  Totes thought that was a dickbutt on the top though.
discgolf,3djkyi,timberrich,2,Thu Jul 16 20:14:24 2015 UTC,haha I can see how it could appear that way at first glance.  You probably just gave someone somewhere an idea.
discgolf,3djkyi,HolyHydroBlunts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"The Bag:  My SO surprised me with this for my birthday this past month. Needless to say I was ecstatic.  It is the Voodoo Spinaltap. It is absolutely incredible, and I've been loving it. I can probably type up a more in depth look at it if anyone is interested.  The Discs From left to right, top to bottom:  (sorry about all of the glare, it was really bright outside and I'm no photographer)  2x Champion Boss     I really don't throw these unless the wind is incredibly outrageous, but I just don't have the heart to take them out of the bag.   The maroon one was part of a players pack for a College Station, TX tourney   Z Xpress     One of my favorite tunnel shot drive discs. If the fairway is tight there is a very good chance I'm throwing this.   Champion Viking     I don't throw it much but when I do it is probably for a light forehand or a turnover shot.   Champion Starfire     I use this primarily for forehand shots that I want to keep straight   Champion Orc     This is my goto forehand disc. It is an awful camoflage color, and it is getting pretty warn but I love it. If I don't have the space for it to turn left on the forehand I use the starfire.   First run Star Xcaliber     This is my goto wind distance driver.  It is also great for spike hyzers. I can always count on it to come back for me.   Star Pro Worlds stamp Katana     This is my goto for long drives with a strong tail wind. The turn on it makes it fly great in these conditions.   Orion LS     If i have a tunnel that opens up once you pass it, I choose this over the xpress. I can get more distance out of it than the xpress, but the high speed turn makes it kind of dangerous for tight tunnels.   Star Wraith Champion Wraith     My wraiths are my go to drivers, and they speak for themselves.   The star is a little less stable and more broken in than the champ.   The yellow one is a Capitol of Texas Open, Pease Park (RIP) stamp. Definitely my favorite disc.   DX TeeBird     This is a new one for me. I've seen everyone on /r/discgolf raving about them so I picked up a DX to see what all the hype is about. Still figuring out where it fits in my bag, but so far I do like it. May need to check out a better plastic.   SS Magnet     This is my oldest putter and it is beat to hell. I use it for anyhyzer lines mostly.   Champion Roc3     Got this a couple of months ago, and holy crap what a disc. It instantly became my most thrown disc. The way it flies makes it seem like it is sentient or something.   DX Viper     Love this disc. I use it mostly in mid range situations, but every now and then I break it out for a longer upshot if the wind is up or if I really need to fade left.   x2 SS Omega     The red one is my thrower, and the orange one is my putter.   Not shown:   First run Champion Groove    Used to use it for tailwind drives, but it was replaced by the katana  Countless lost Destroyers that have yet to be replaced.   It's a lot of molds, but I've been using these guys for a long time now and they each have their own situation."

I picked one up in a trade recently and haven't thrown it much but hopefully can get some sick forehand turnovers with it.    That Teebird is gonna fly very similar to the Starfire for long, straight forehands with a bit of fade at the end.  It's a great disc as long as you don't put it into many trees."
discgolf,3djkyi,Johnzsmith,2,Thu Jul 16 21:05:47 2015 UTC,"I really like it. It is shockingly overstable for a fairway driver. I can put it up with almost any power in any wind conditions and have it fly the same. It generally flies straight with big fade at the end. It also has a similar rim feel to the roc3 which I find very nice.  I've never really thrown it forehand, but I imagine it would make for some nice turnovers. I throw some pretty sweet flex shots with it.  As far as the Teebird, that's kind of the vibe I'm getting from it. I'm going to pick up a F2 champ or star soon because I beat this poor guy to hell figuring it out."
discgolf,3djkyi,MrFirmHandshake,2,Thu Jul 16 21:20:48 2015 UTC,The teebird is my favorite disc. I personally like 166-170 gram slightly domey star teebirds the most. Just my 2 cents.

discgolf,3djza1,righteousmane,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. When it is hot and humid, the water vapor droplets keeps the disc lifted, but the heat moving upwards will make the disc less stable and prone to move right for a RHBH."
discgolf,3djza1,thekeylimeinmiami,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:52:07 2015 UTC,I don't know about the effect on the disc but air temp does affect flight. Hotter air tends to help glide imo
discgolf,3djza1,MetalHacker87,-2,Fri Jul 17 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"Not unless you are one of the world's top 10 players.  The only exception is discs which start out soft, and get super-ultra soft in the heat. Those discs actually stand a chance of deforming slightly in the hit, and thus taking power out of the throw.  My buddy Pete Bowie used to have a chilli-bin full of ice, where he cooled his discs prior to distance record attempts. Said it made a difference.  I think the difference it made was a mental one. :P"

discgolf,3dl67d,Kobrakai081,3,Fri Jul 17 04:02:58 2015 UTC,Your elbow is bent in reach back. Try to make it straight. Your front leg is almost pointing towards your target. Try to have it away from the target and on toes for maximum distance and at least 90° away from the target. Your legs shouldn't be on the same line towards the basket. Have your front leg be a bit more forward (not towards the basket) compared to your left leg for more body rotation power. This is better explained here. Also generally people do the follow through by spinning on their heel instead of toes.
discgolf,3dl67d,Ilkq,2,Fri Jul 17 13:18:16 2015 UTC,"This is a really good video to start working on. The back foot should behind the front foot, there's almost no reach back because of this and the throw is in circular shape, that's the reason it goes into this big hyzer.  Also you're curling your wrist which makes it almost impossible to do a hyzer flip, stopping doing this will most likely give you the most distance.  Maybe work on throwing from a stand-still? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQzUrn80UI"

I'm not one to critique form, but if your could lean over your right leg more it would lower your right elbow more. This would create a more natural release for you.

I absolutely love my Champ TeeBird. It's my favorite disc right now. Super straight with a reliable fading finish to the left. (Legacy Rival is also a great option as it is essentially a TeeBird clone)  I compliment the TeeBird with a Prodigy F7 for understable, right-turning shots. The F7 is one of the only under stable discs I've thrown that I didn't have issues with turning and burning. I love the way it steadily tracks to the right, then straightens up at the end of the flight for a little dumpy finish. I also get surprising distance from it. If I can manage a good hyzer-flip (I'm inconsistent with my release) it will go dead straight."

discgolf,3djzic,DGsirb1978,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:11 2015 UTC,Does it really help with distance?  With my luck I would throw it either straight up or hit my buddy in the face while he's standing behind me.
discgolf,3djzic,SpacemanSpiff23,2,Thu Jul 16 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"You generate more momentum and thus power through the 360 turn. The key is that you still have to have a solid pull through as well as release angle, as well as just general good coordination in order to nail it."
discgolf,3djzic,Oap,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:08:21 2015 UTC,What Oap said. It only actually adds distance if you can maintain your pull through and release angle control of each throw.
discgolf,3djzic,DylThomps,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:40:11 2015 UTC,I love 360 drives. I've got decent aim with them too. I usually use them when I have to go over water so I know I'll make it to the land.
discgolf,3djzic,gignacious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to risk reward.  The risk is that you might go off target but if you are on a wide open shot, and you are confident that you can make the upshot for par rather easily, I would say that is low risk.  If the reward is an increase in distance that give you a viable chance at bird (which you know you wouldn't get with non 360 drive) then that seems like a good reward.  So if the risk is an easy par and reward is a good chance at bird I'd say that's a good situation.  If it's just damn fun for you then it is all reward!"
discgolf,3djzic,henrihell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:40 2015 UTC,You see pros use it every now and then so it's legit. I remember david wiggins get a chance at an eagle at maple hill with a 360 drive. Unfortunately he missed and ended up with a tap in birdie.
discgolf,3djzic,M0b1u5,0,Fri Jul 17 09:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yes Indeed. I have watched Simon Lizotte throw two consecutive turn-around drives in a row - three times. That means he went OB three times from the tee, and then re-teed each time, like a fool.  Later that night - while a bit drunk, he was heard to say ""What does it take to beat Paul?""  I piped up, and said loudly ""Stop throwing stupid turnaround drives"". He poked his tongue out at me.  They are truly spectacular - and Simon is the ultimate showman, but they make zero sense anywhere except the high desert, or totally open holes. The chances of them going wrong are far higher than going right. Simon could have beaten Feldberg in that comp, but silly play lost it for him."

discgolf,3djkfu,INeedUrgentHelpPls,3,Thu Jul 16 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"Stick with the fairway drivers for now, because you have a pretty good grasp of what's happening, but keep one of those big stable drivers in your bag for those occasions when you want a disc to go about 200' down the fairway then make a 90-degree meathook turn to the left, say to go around an obstacle like a giant cluster of trees.  I mean, if you know what a disc is going to do, even if it's ugly doing it, you might come into a situation where that ugly thing is exactly what you want. I keep a Pro Firebird in my bag for those rare occasions when going out about 250' and then suddenly falling dramatically out of the sky 100' to the left is what I want the disc to do. It will do that admirably, and I don't hate the disc for not going farther, I love it for being my big stupid meathook disc.   I've played entire rounds driving with a Seer (speed 7 fairway driver), which is very much like the FD, and it was glorious. There's no shame in it at all. High single-digit speed fairway drivers and drivers are the tits. Enjoy!"
discgolf,3djkfu,Novaova,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"I love the FD2, teebird3, AJ star teebird and champ thunderbird for those shots. I especially like the thunderbird with its ridiculous glide at speed 9 or 10. For me I'm getting around 375ft for all those.  I've noticed Discmania discs all seem to have more glide when compared to their Innova counterparts.   EDIT: FYI for my distance drives I'm using a star destroyer or S-line PD and seem to max out around 400-410ft in an open field/flat ground. On the internet I'm somewhere in the 550ft-650ft range ;)  ALSO: Watch out for weight. For instance I have two S-line PD's. My flippy one is 167g and it's very easy to throw and control and if I overpower it will flip over; I can even get a pretty reliable sky-anny out of this disc if I hit the line right. The other is 176g and it's a very stable disc great for headwind shots or anny flex shot or something that I know will definitely fade at the end. Weights make a difference for all types of discs."
discgolf,3djkfu,The_Warwolf,2,Thu Jul 16 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on choosing your main drivers? Do you use more often fairway drivers or not?   It depends on the course, but I will often throw a fairway over a distance driver because they are more controllable and I'm not losing that much distance. It's not like my distance drivers are going 400' and the fairways are going 300'. It's more like 400' and 350' to 375' and depending on the line I need the loss of that distance is worth the trade off.  What do I mean by it depends on the course? My home course is technical and not very long (total d is 6316' so avg hole is 351'). There are only three holes I drive with my Destroyer on, and they aren't even the longest holes. The course is technical and tight, so my speed 9 control drivers (Orion LF) and Teebird/River see a lot of action. Then again, there's a super easy, just wide open course nearby too. I was there playing the short tees to red pins last weekend with a friend who doesn't play as much, and I absolutely slayed the course (including a 171' ace!) using the Destroyer all the time on huge, unnecessary hyzers. There was so much sky and no trees, so I just threw big dumb hyzers all day because I could.  In general, you'll find that fairway drivers just give you better control, at the cost of some distance. Very often, you'll find that, unless you want to be very aggressive, throwing a fairway and coming up 30' short is preferable to the higher risk shot that might run at the basket or park the hole. Remember, even if you come up 30' short, you're still in the circle putting. That's good reason to throw a fairway on a 400' hole."

discgolf,3djkfu,randomt2000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"If you look at amateur play, or even open, playing for par is actually pretty good. If you play even in any tournament, you have a good chance for payout. Yet, we all want those birdies, and we want to play under, so we're tempted to go for distance. But reliability is way more important. If there is a hole where with your fairway driver you have no chance for birdie, but with a distance driver you have a slight chance for birdie, but also a chance to go totally astray, it's smarter to leave the distance driver in the bag and play for par."
discgolf,3djkfu,M0b1u5,0,Thu Jul 16 23:45:54 2015 UTC,"some serious money was spent.   You are so cute.  Now, the thing about driver speeds, is that as the numbers increase, so does the ""spray"" factor. A speed 14 disc will deviate from its thrown line very severely, if anything goes wrong with the throw - whether it's wind, or release angle, or whatever.  Contrast that with a Speed 8 fairway driver: A slight mistake will see the disc deviate far less from the thrown line.  So, it is always the case, that it you CAN reach a spot with a speed 8, then you would be crazy to chuck a speed 14.  You always must use what ball golfers call ""full clubs"" on pretty much every shot. That means throwing hard all the time. It is far harder to dial back backhand power and remain accurate. This is why you choose a putter when you are 60 metres out, and not a midrange.  So it is much easier, and more accurate to throw the slowest possible disc for any shot - even rollers."

Schusterick/Nikko/McBeth seem to thrive under pressure. Then there are players like Wysocki (and admittedly myself) who tend to have brain farts in those situations and the pressure seems to get to them. Then we have Simon. I believe Simon may belong in the category with Wysocki; however, Simon deflects that pressure by acting like he doesn't truly care about the outcome. He will throw the crazy throw and when the round is over, he is able to use those crazy throws as an excuse. Something like, ""yeah, but if I would have thrown my backhand on that hole then I would have won, but I just don't really care enough..."" It is an easy way out of the pressure. Just my opinion."

discgolf,3djh22,t4nkd,2,Thu Jul 16 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"I just finished doing exactly what you're talking about, except I was setting one up indoors in my bonus room (converted garage).  At the price of the Club Champ I would be legitimately concerned about tearing through that net, and the other one doesn't look big enough to satisfy my concerns with grip-locking unless I was releasing less than a few feet away from it.  I went with this guy on eBay.  He has a ton of options depending on your needs and they seem to be quality nets that will last and, more importantly, that you can trust.  I personally went with this net, which is listed as 10' x 15'.  However, even without stretching it out really I have it doubled-up from my ceiling for extra resilience in those same dimensions (so it's really like I got a 20' x 15').  As far as securing it indoors it's just a matter of anchoring a few screw hooks into the ceiling joists (a stud finder to guarantee a center-drill each time is a must though since you'll want a decent size hook).  If you're building outside like you're talking about there are quite a few DIY golfing net enclosure projects to choose from.  PVC seems popular for these and looks sturdy, but might be overkill in my opinion.  I really think you could make some L-shaped supports using 2x4's with removable supports (for easy breakdown and transport) that connect them across the top and bottom, and then just hang the net off that."

It's great for threading needles in the forest or parking under the basket on 150'-200' approach shots. My Skeeter is as comfy as an old pair of sweatpants that's been cut off and turned into pajama shorts.

Also, never heard of anyone throwing a Cro or a Wedge either.   the numbers on a Lycan seem some great, I'll have to try it out if I get an opportunity, but don't expect it take over the M4 as my straight flying mid"

discgolf,3di21v,12jammydodgers,3,Thu Jul 16 14:10:29 2015 UTC,Personally I love my Discraft Buzz in any plastic. I can throw that thing far and it will hold a straight line with a nice left finish that or a roc 3 if you like beads on your discs. As for a putter that comes to what putter you like the feel of the most. I use Discraft challengers  and a star aviar for my putters but i would go to a store and feel what putter fits best in your hand and practice a bunch. I didn't start working on my putts when i first started playing and I regret it every time I miss what should be easy putts lol
discgolf,3di21v,danbfree,3,Thu Jul 16 13:34:13 2015 UTC,"In addition to getting a putter and mid, be sure to drop the boss. Permanently, or at least for a few years. I suggest getting the cheaper plastic (pro d, dx, etc) for 8-10$ for your first mids and putter, and make sure you like what you got before getting the premium versions. For the putter, go to a store and figure out which feels best in your hand. The Wizard is one of the best putters on the market, but you couldn't pay me to play with one, because the bead ruins my grip. Determine if you like beaded or non beaded putters before you buy. I'm also gonna throw out the buzzzz ss as my suggestion for first mid."
discgolf,3di21v,Ryceness,3,Thu Jul 16 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"Depending on what city you are in, 2nd hand sports stores should have used discs for cheap... and the ones mentioned already are good ones to go with, Innova is the ""largest"" brand by far and you'll see those out there the most but many others have great ones.  By starting with, and only using a Champion Boss, you will have advantages and disadvantages when you move to other discs. Remember to be patient, those discs listed in the top post are all very common and fairly easy to control so keep working with them!"
discgolf,3di21v,danbfree,2,Thu Jul 16 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"Agree, however many innova  discs seems to have different flight characteristics even though it's supposed to be the same. I got a Starfire which was supposed to be a very overstable disc,  but it was almost as under stable as a Mamba. I love that disc  but I won't get one like that again. I think that is the biggest  minus with those discs. I'd highly recommend start using a stable putter like a Pure or Mercy, that really tells you what you are doing right/wrong. Go some rounds using only a putter, and you will really get a lot better."
discgolf,3di21v,Vhadka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:56:53 2015 UTC,"DX is the most understable and Champion plastic the most overstable plastic in Innova discs of the same name, I try to go with Star and Gstar for consistency... and yes, after playing for 15 months and still only playing about 2 under on short 9 hole courses and about bogey golf on long courses, I am turning to working on my mids and putters more for sure... If you want to just be a casual player, stay with understable discs to have fun but if you want to learn to actually throw proper then go with stable discs for sure."

discgolf,3di8aj,Landino68,5,Thu Jul 16 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"Its not necessarily ""choosing"" one way or the other. When you transfer your weight correctly through your hips in a disc golf drive, you automatically turn on your heel. Its just how your body works. If you're turning on your toe, its either because you're:   forcing yourself to, which is worse for your body long term doing something wrong in the process of your weight transfer   Now inevitably someone is going to say ""Oh but Paul McBeth doesn't always turn on his heel"". This is correct. He kind of turns on the middle of his foot...if that makes sense. Either way, turning on your toe, 99% of the time, is usually a sign of a technical flaw in your form. That being said if it works for you, it works for you.   I've had guys who have been playing for a long time ask me for help with their form and it just becomes too much of a chore for them to change every habit they've been doing for 10+ years. So as long as you're not hurting yourself and you're comfortable with your game, there's nothing really anyone can say."
discgolf,3di8aj,Auriyon,2,Thu Jul 16 14:17:10 2015 UTC,I'll give it a shot. Im trying to improve my form because I'm getting distance just not super consistent on placement and getting some extra distance is always nice lol.
discgolf,3di8aj,IMA_grinder,2,Thu Jul 16 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's hard to ""give it a shot."" I don't think it's something you think about like reaching back, not rounding, head position, etc. It's more an effect from having good form, weight transfer, and center of gravity, but you can feel it once other things sync up.   One thing I've noticed about transferring your weight through a balanced center of gravity is getting your left arm down (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sIGmhct0lK4/UsGf_0UsbzI/AAAAAAAAUKU/DURCaS-JiMU/s1600/hitZone2.JPG). By keeping that arm close to your body it moves your CoG closer to you where your weight transfer then moves through you to your heel rather than on your toes if that makes sense.

discgolf,3di8aj,SearchingforSilky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:17:44 2015 UTC,I just think he's pivoting from the base of his foot.  Neither heel nor toe.  Its as if he's just perfectly balancing those forces.
discgolf,3di8aj,MikeTheBlueCow,3,Thu Jul 16 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"From what I understand toe pivoting is stressful on your knee and that's not good for the long term, even if you don't already feel any knee problems. Also it makes your leg less of a support and does not give as much power (again this is what I've been told and I'm not sure how much of a power difference there is).   I am a toe pivoter and I'm working on fixing it, as I need to add that lower body/hip power into my throw anyways I'm just trying to learn how to do it the right way. From my practicing it seems it is dependent on proper placement and angle of your plant foot and shifting/pushing (not spinning/rotating) your hip forward. I am finding that my biggest thing to fix is the push forward instead of rotating my hips."
discgolf,3di8aj,Casus125,2,Thu Jul 16 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to know if it had some advantage over using your toe as the pivot?   You'll get better weight transfer and you'll be using more of your hips  if you plant and pivot on your heel.  I'm trying to imagine pivoting on the toe and all I can think is ""Ouch, my knee."""
discgolf,3di8aj,threedaysmore,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"To go just a little further into what /u/Auriyon has said I think that spinning on the heel is just about the only way to rotate your foot if you're bracing correctly.  If you watch this video from the guy at heavydisc.com (whose username always escapes me...something about dinosaurs I believe) and  you look at where is weight is in relation to where his feet are I think it's pretty easy to see why he's going to pivoting on his heel.  That being said I think this is something most people consider a fairly small form refinement.  It's not going to limit you like rounding will, but when you starting trying to get that extra 5-10 feet on a 400+ drive these are some of the smaller things that can get you headed in the right direction.  Usually what causes someone to get up on the toe is while attempting to punch their elbow forward to get it in front of there body (like what McBeth is doing right here), it's not just the elbow that moves forward but the thrower lurches their center mass as well.  This means that your center of gravity is directly over or in front of your foot at release which causes the toe spin.  If you look at McBeth's release point you can see that just about all of his midsection and central upper body is actually behind the heel of his plant foot, causing the heel/mid-foot rotation."
discgolf,3di8aj,Auriyon,3,Thu Jul 16 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"Good points, but I would argue that it can actually be a huge form refinement. Because pivoting on your toes usually indicates a larger form flaw (not utilizing your hips and weight shift correctly), it can be incredibly hard to change/fix because most people have no idea how to even do it the correct way."
discgolf,3di8aj,threedaysmore,2,Thu Jul 16 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"It's most certainly one of the harder things to change, hell just about everything is after a few years of doing it.  Perhaps I should have said is that it's not one of the more elementary form flaws like rounding or crossing in front for your x-step (how do people even do this and not bust ass)."
discgolf,3di8aj,Auriyon,2,Thu Jul 16 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"There's a guy I used to play with back home whose form is god awful (x-step in front, no run-up at all, all arm) and he throws like 400 feet. With Grooves as one of his main drivers. I wish I was making this up."

However, I've been strong-arming it and is currently sitting with a hurting shoulder.  I was just out today for some daily putting and tried some drives with my putters using more hips and forcing my arm to become the whip instead of strong-arming and not really following through.  Boom, ~250ft standstill putter shots, straight as an arrow where I struggled (turn and burn or turning over) while strong-arming. I think hips are key to good (or at least safer) form.

discgolf,3di8aj,jacobmuellerr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:18:22 2015 UTC,The reason my hip hurts it because I brace with my righ leg but I don't pivot.  So the twist goes into the hip.
discgolf,3di8aj,gignacious,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Then you need to tighten your core more, to take the springy-ness out of the turn.  The force will turn on your heel pivot, but if you sponge it up, you might not get enough to cause the turn.  Keep your shoulders and hips square, and perhaps you'll get a cleaner pivot with less pull on your hip flexor.   (I had a similar problem, and this was the cause and cure.)"
discgolf,3di8aj,Auriyon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:34 2015 UTC,It's a whole lot less stressful on your knees for starters. You use your knees a whole lot more in disc golf than I think many people realize and a heel pivot is really going to take some stress out of them.   In my experience I also am able to transfer more of the  torqued energy into a throw from my shoulders and hips when I rotate on my heel. If you watch some of the Max distance footage from Simon Lizotte and Dave Wiggins you can really see how their energy is transferred into the heel during a shot even so much that they continue to rotate and it brings them off of their feet. I've found that I transfer the most energy by rotating on the heel as it's more natural and a whole lot cleaner than rotating on the toes.
discgolf,3di8aj,gignacious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not an engineer, physicist or physical bone muscle doctor guy person but this is how I understand it.  When you go into your pivot you are planting your foot to create a, well, pivot for your weight transfer/push off and rotation.  Now, if you think of your knee and ankle as spring/shock absorbers then pivoting on your toe creates two points of shock absorbtion.  Your ""springs"" are absorbing the energy of your weight transfer/push off, which means that much less energy is being transfered to your disc.  If you pivot on your heel, then only one shock absorber is being used.  This means a greater amount of energy will be transferred into your disc then with both ankle and knee.    This can similarly be seen with your push off foot.  It is common knowledge to push of from you toe opposed to a flat foot.  This, is in a sense, an inverse of the aforementioned situation.  You want both ankle and knee ""springs"" that have stored energy to, well, spring and transfer their energy (push off from the back foot) into forward momentum that is transferred to your disc.  A flat foot push off generates less energy and you are only launching of off a single spring (knee).  Hope this makes sense or someone else with more background can call me out and fix it or confirm.  Ill throw a /u/Auriyon in here as well and see if he has anything else to add."
discgolf,3di8aj,lohkeytx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:00 2015 UTC,I think you flipped toe and heel in the first paragraph - heel gives you more solid point of contact.
discgolf,3di8aj,arkiverge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"Possible I made it a bit confusing, I was trying to go for that though.  Heel pivot absorbs some energy in the knee allowing more to transfer to the disc.  Toe pivot absorbs energy in the ankle and knee so less energy is transferred to the disc."
discgolf,3di8aj,Ryceness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"spinning on your heel spins you in place around your entire leg.  spinning on your toe is spinning around your 'structural' point on your foot that connects to the leg and puts pressure on your knee.    Just stand up and spin in a circle on your heel, you'll feel like you're spinning in place.  Then do it on your toe, you'll feel like you're going in a circle around your toe."
discgolf,3di8aj,M0b1u5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find refining from a toe pivot to a heel pivot will be less about consciously making that change specifically, and more about making a different change that then causes your body to make the change automatically (namely, and almost entirely, having your center of gravity more central instead of leaning way forward as you're about to come through).  Someone linked some pics of McBeth in this thread that illustrate this much better than I'm describing."

discgolf,3dhdf6,Mornos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:59:29 2015 UTC,I always do some up-shots then standstill shot and finally a round of drives before I stretch so my muscles are a bit warmed up. The stretching routine itself is hard to describe I think your best bet is to look up some basic stretching routines (they don´t differ a lot) on youtube because you need to see how to do them correctly. If you do some things incorrectly stretching may even hurt you.
discgolf,3dhdf6,Mornos,2,Thu Jul 16 09:43:58 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that there's not a very big practice area at the local course, just a putting basket. So I'd need something else than disc golf to warm up, especially driving is not an option. I could warm up at the nearby football field but then I'd still have to get back in the car and drive for a bit befpre I'm at the track."
discgolf,3dhdf6,wcc7777777,2,Thu Jul 16 09:56:39 2015 UTC,I didn´t think of taking into account that your course might be more crowded than the ones here :D  You can also warm up by doing some easy exercises. I try to look up which ones im talking about but it´s difficult to find videos or guides that show the good ones.

I had to replace the Flow after I had my last one stolen by a group of 8 drunken asshole teenagers. They couldn't have been much older than 18 and they were walking around with a cooler of beer behind a middle school... They were standing around at the baskets for a good 3 minutes after finishing, so my friend and I hole hopped them and they were probably pissed about it. My drive turned over right in front of them and they all claimed they hadn't seen anything... They tried way too hard to convince me of it too. I didn't buy it for a second but there wasn't too much I could do. 1000% positive it didn't land in the rough so I would have found it if it was there. I'm pretty pissed, it was my favorite disc and it was beat in to perfection...this new one is nice, but they're never the same."

discgolf,3dfu4k,ern19,12,Wed Jul 15 23:00:36 2015 UTC,Foregoing a flick is a short term fix to increasing your game right now. You are probably just getting better at a backhand. However you don't want to lose the flick either because both forehand and backhand are crucial for a well rounded player.
discgolf,3dfu4k,AviFeintEcho,5,Wed Jul 15 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"I do still use it for approaches and getting out of trouble, but off the tee I was throwing flicks on holes that better players were throwing backhand shots on. That's where my rationale is coming from. It has just been an unexpected help in other areas i.e. distance."
discgolf,3dfu4k,SoySauceSyringe,3,Wed Jul 15 23:30:19 2015 UTC,"I went the opposite direction- i.e., started throwing flicks. My strategy has always been to make the right play regardless of how good I am at it. Often I wouldn't want to throw a flick because I wasn't as confident with it as I was with my backhands, but I did it anyway. Now I have a pretty good flick and I'm not afraid to use it when the need arises.  Casual rounds are a great time to step out of your comfort zone and work on the weaker parts of your game."

discgolf,3dfu4k,EricBrennan,5,Thu Jul 16 00:27:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  I was a flick player for 6+ years.  I'm talking religiously.  I could anything with a flick.  Then one year I got a bug up my butt and said, ""I'm going to be just as good with a backhand as I am with a flick.""  Now I second guess my flick shots, and can throw about 50ft further on drives.

But I've been working on it, I can see how to get a better distance with the BH, but I have to keep working on. My BH is probably about 200 feet.

discgolf,3dfu4k,_TeddyG_,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:23 2015 UTC,remember to not completely forget about your flick! still throw it every once in a while to keep it up to par. you will want it when you get to a certain level and your backhand cant throw every single shot that goes to the right.
discgolf,3dfu4k,doublethemakesure,2,Thu Jul 16 02:19:05 2015 UTC,"I had handicapped myself for far too long by only throwing forehand and about 4 years into my game I started developing my traditional backhand shot that really opened up distance I never had before. The best way to put it into context though is that they are both shots that I reserve for specific conditions. I get more distance out of my backhand but for short shots requiring precision, I could land a forehand shot on a 2x4 if I had to. I honestly consider myself lucky because a lot of people never develope a good forehand and I truly believe it sets them back."

Lots of holes I thought were backhand-favorable work just as well FH, and I think FH lets me rely on my hand/eye coordination (which is much better than my disc golf form) on heavily wooded courses where distance isn't an issue.

I was in the exact same boat last year - heavy flicker and only used backhand when I absolutely needed to.  This year I've been focusing on the backhand too and reserving the forehand to the shots that it's really meant for.  It's made huge improvements for me and I'm glad to hear it's doing the same for you.  I still feel I could shoot a little lower if I used the flick more often, but I know that's temporary until the backhand catches up a little more.  Stick with it as it's definitely worth it."

There isn't any strength involved, the only thing that will keep you in the game and throwing well is form.   250 feet is not far by any means, I'm assuming you're 47 based on your posts, even if you're older, I play with my girlfriends father (50) and older players all the time, good form is the only thing that will help you, all the older guys who aren't getting hurt have good form. I would set a goal of 350' with a Valkryie or something similar before you step it up. I would slow down, ditch the high speed discs and work on your form. It makes playing much easier and takes away a huge risk of injuries."

discgolf,3dgdzm,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:08:44 2015 UTC,"47 years of throwing discs.  I'm older. The strength issue is just basic arm strength. Not to overpower a throw.  Heck I've never been able to physically overpower anything.  I'm short and thin.  Form and technique is everything.  I was only throwing to about 75 or 80 percent today.  Full speed backhands aren't in the cards for weeks.  Past shoulder injuries from team handball, wrestling, and martial arts classes when compounded with tendons that tighten and don't restretch easily mean I can't jump in the deep end right away. (My orthopedic surgeon said to never get a cast again or I'd lose mobility. It took 10 years after the cast came off for my left arm to straighten out after it was hyperextended and snapped.)  I'm not dead set on throwing anything it's just what I've got right now.  I just haven't got many discs to choose from, yet.  They didn't have much to choose from other than the ones I got."
discgolf,3dgdzm,SaintVaIentine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:46:43 2015 UTC,With good follow through you should be able to play a couple 18s before your arm gives out. If you are throwing 250 I would stay at speed 9 and lower on your discs.
discgolf,3dgdzm,Murraybird,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"My distance will go up as I throw more.  I plan to throw just about every day since there are two different courses only 2 miles from my son's school and one only 5 miles from my house.  (...and I need to get out and do something.)  Why stay below 10?  I was throwing a 175 Wraith and a 150 Champion Boss to within a few feet of each other.     ...you should be able to play a couple 18s...      If standard demographics apply...I'm twice as old as you and you have no idea what age and lack of use does to the elasticity of your tendons.    (But I could be wrong.  I don't mean to seem snippy, but I am the oldest member of a couple of subs.)  I'll be spending the next few weeks just throwing repeatedly concentrating on smoothing my throw, generating power, and grooving strokes as soon as I've got them right.  The last thing I need is another rotator cuff injury.  I don't heal as fast (or as well) anymore.  The whole point is to not have my arm go out.  That's bad, really bad."
discgolf,3dgdzm,Auriyon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:42:43 2015 UTC,"Trust him, throw speed 9, you can keep one faster disc in your bag, but no more."
discgolf,3dgdzm,Auriyon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:45:58 2015 UTC,"But, why?"
discgolf,3dgdzm,hudzerflip,3,Thu Jul 16 03:49:45 2015 UTC,"So there's a sort of counter-intuitive notion surrounding higher speed discs. Yes, they do go farther. However they, are ""speed-gated"" in a way - in that they will only go farther if they are thrown at the speed they are meant to be thrown. Now if Simon Lizotte throws a Teebird and then a Boss, the Boss will go at least 150 feet farther. However, most normal humans cannot throw discs at 90 miles per hour.  So lets for argument's sake say you can throw a disc at 40mph. And lets again say that that is the perfect speed to throw a speed 9 disc. So when that Speed 9 disc (a Thunderbird for example), is thrown at its intended speed, it will go around 300-400 feet depending on a number of other factors (release angle, height of the throw, etc.). However, a Speed 12 disc released at that speed will not fly that far and dump to the left earlier, because its meant to be thrown at 60mph. (These numbers are all junk, but the relative relationship is the same).   In the end, if you're comfortable with what you're doing, do it. I once watch a guy shoot like 7 down on shorts on my home course going off the tee with a Millenium Quasar (boss equivalent) on every hole, whether it was 200 feet or 400 feet. He was able to hit his lines with it and it worked for him. But playing like that puts a cap on how good you can potentially be."

discgolf,3dgdzm,ohmseven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"You're throwing a wraith and a boss maxed out at 225. A 9 speed will get you more distance at the early stages of playing. With better technique comes more distance. Once you can throw a midrange about 300, then step up to a wraith or a boss."
discgolf,3dgdzm,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"Couple things to consider, follow through will extend any rounds you want to play and is the number one reason people hurt their arms, (not following through all the way). As for the speed of your discs, if you are actually trying to throw farther you need form work. A disc that is faster than your speed will mask MANY of the errors in your form, a slight exception would be your very light drivers, which let you get a ""faster"" speed to behave more like it's heavier brother, my longest drives are with very light drivers, but all of my most consistent drives come from a disk better suited to my speed. If you get discs that fly near the speed you can throw you much better line versatility, allowing the discs to complete their flight path and learning how to throw them at different angles to really open up your game, allowing you to get a lot more out of your discs. These are the building blocks you are working on that will translate to your faster discs as you get better. It will also help you work on arm speed, instead of throwing a disc that can't reach the speed it needs to behave in the same way that these lower speed drivers will. I would recommend a mantis and a tl3, tl3 is very straight, mantis is a little bit flipper, when you can hyzerflip the mantis, I would disc up. Ultimately you will play what's fun for you but those steps will make you a better player. Hopefully that was explained well enough."
discgolf,3dgdzm,SaintVaIentine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:16:25 2015 UTC,"Actually I understood nothing of that except the parts about follow through.  I've got 47 years of throwing discs under my belt and as many playing tennis (at 4-4.5).  I understand about form, follow through, weight transference, footwork, and breathing to maximize power and control.  I practiced slice, screwball, flat, and american twist serves until I could do them blindfolded at full speed.  I practiced coming out of blocks when I was a sprinter until it was second nature and I spun on a bike at about 120 for hours at time.  I know about grooving my motion and working in power.  I know about stop motion injuries (tennis elbow, hammer arm, rotator tears playing team handball from really big guys crossing arms with me (ouch), etc.)    What did you mean by:      A disc that is faster than your speed will mask MANY of the errors in your form.     I did find that I wasn't able to control the Katana and the Boss yet.  I also know why.  My grip, arm motion, and release were not consistent.  Their flat design leads to exaggeration of mistakes in form.  (I learned that back in the '60's throwing different frisbees.)  They're rated really fast and didn't mask a damn thing they just made every mistake more visible.  Form work is my life.  It's how I do everything physical."
discgolf,3dgdzm,durkaflurkaflame,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:49:14 2015 UTC,"A faster speed disc will mask form issues by virtue of flight path, always overpowering the things you've done wrong with a very over stable tendency, that's fine for certain shots, but you lose the reinforcement of throwing a disc and having the disc work for you. If you play a round with just a mid range, you will drive better. That's because when you throw it, it translates your problems into flight path, making you correct your problems instead of masking them. If you put it to the right, it will stay right etc, where that wraith will always end left because it will overpower those issues."
discgolf,3dgdzm,ericb45696,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:18:15 2015 UTC,"If you really believe form is important, Im confused as to why you're refusing to take advice from everyone on here saying thay throwing a lower speed disc will help you with your form. Most of us here have the same goal, and our advice comes both from our own experiences, and nerding out talking about form and disc flights with each other all day. Most people here will advise you to throw putters or mids till you can get them out to 200-300 feet to have a good foundation for form. I wish I had listened earlier when people gave me that advice.   High speed drivers will fade hard on 200-300ft throws. If they are going straight that suggests you are putting anhyzer or OAT on your throw. Both of which are habits thay will be bad for your form in the long run and be harder on your body. One of the great things about disc golf these days is that with a growing community and pro scene, there is finally some sort of consensus on proper technique and how to improve, why not use that to your advantage?"

If I try hard... either a gross miss or metal and a plop on the ground.  But practicing helps a lot.  Its dry as fuck around here so when I go out to water the yard I set the sprinkler up and then have at the basket.  The mist from the sprinkler drops the temp about 10 degrees so it's bearable to do it for a few rounds.

I actually find it catches putts better than you'd expect- I've hit long, fast spin putts on it from 70 feet and it's good. Basically you're looking for value and it's pretty good for that. The cross chains help alot with that. The Hive's look really great too, I may have looked into that had I not gotten the lite first. The discatcher traveler or the skillshot are good baskets but less indicative of an actual basket for sure.

discgolf,3dgp83,Vhadka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:24:33 2015 UTC,"You need to take away molds, not add.   How far do you throw , and where do you play? If you play in the woods, Id work on the mids.  I like discraft mids, and would say a Buzzz OS , Buzzz, and Comets are a good line up while maintaining a familiar feel.   Your fastest disc is the thunderbird at speed 11, and you rate it your most stable fairway. From that I would infer that you throw less then 350?   With that assumption I would recommend getting a stable glo valk and a nice star valk for distance duty. If you have to deal with a head wind throw the firebird.    Kinda shooting in the dark here....  Tell us what your goals are or what you would like to do that you cant and Id be happy to make a suggestion."
discgolf,3dgp83,Trickyatesome,2,Thu Jul 16 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"Thunderbird is a speed 9, where are you getting 11 from?  OP, I do think you have probably too many molds going on here, but that's personal preference more than anything.  Also if you're topping out at 300' I'd put most of the drivers you have away.  Again, just me.  I'm in about the same spot distance wise for backhands.  The only time I bust out something higher than a speed 7 is when I'm using a forehand, because I can somewhat consistently flick a destroyer 350+.  You have a ton of overlap I feel.  Most of your mids are understable or straight to understable.  Also a glide isn't a midrange."
discgolf,3dgp83,Grimario,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:55:49 2015 UTC,I play at a range of courses. Open and wooded. Short and long. I throw around 280-300. Just seeing if I had any basic spots that were not accounted for.
discgolf,3dgp83,Auriyon,5,Thu Jul 16 04:16:43 2015 UTC,"Speaking for everyone. (down vote now) totally love that you took the time to post your bag. Truth be told only you know what you are missing. I know of every disc you carry, but have thrown half of them. I try hard to keep it simple, yet I went from a 10 disc revolution bag for a decade to a dynamic disc  18 soldier bag recently. (little more room, Carries two water bottles, great price). Back to your question.... What are you missing? I'm betting like most of us on r/discgolf its putts.... Sure we miss that one great drive on that line, you know, the right of that tree. If I only had my-------.  Start from the ground up. You have a really nice bag. I can tell you love this sport. Majority of the disc you throw will be your putter. Soon you will figure put that a speed 5/6 will put you within 2 for your Birdie, no one has time for that speed 15 but I'm guessing you are getting that quick. they don't make an arrow that does that, but there might be an archer who can. Few putters (putt, drive, backup) mids(straight, left, right) reliable (if all else fails should have thrown a teebird, beat/stable) and truthfully 3 long drivers (trusted, left, over stable wind) that's a count of 11. Bias aviars, rocs, teebirds, terns, a destroyer. Yet I don't think I've answered your question. If you're not having fun no disc will fill that spot. If you keep missing that line, no disc will hit that line. If you're missing that putt no disc will make that putt. Simplest of terms there's drives, approaches, and putts. Take out wind and lack of confidence then there's 3(straight, right, left) times three is 9 discs needed. So after that confusing bag of blow hard I have a few innova disc I want to trade for your thunderbird."

Get your average number of steps/paces, divide the length of the tape measure by the number of steps/paces, and voila, that's how far you travel in one step/pace.

discgolf,3dehlb,doubleak47,3,Wed Jul 15 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"Our scale is showing that with a good engraving you loose >/=.1 of a gram.

discgolf,3dehlb,gignacious,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think some people would definitely be interested. There is a very skewed demographic on the subreddits and the dg community about even marking your disc though. A good chunk choose not to mark their discs for various reasons and some who do mark get frustrated at the lack of call backs for their lost discs.    So I think you would have some people who would want it for novelty but most would continue to use a sharpie.  If the price was low enough you may get more.   I think a good idea would be marking minis. People don't loose these so I think they would be more willing to purchase a custom engraving.  If you could do pdga numbers, names, custom designs and such. A tournament series I play in was selling metal minis that you could take to a local shop for engraving. Seemed like a cool idea."

discgolf,3dfdg4,DuggleAss,2,Wed Jul 15 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but this even further disadvantages the Rec players that perhaps can't drive to some of the longer holes that a more advanced player may be trying to ace run.  To be equitable to all skill levels, the CTP's would have to be limited to holes where a Rec player has a reasonable chance of taking either the CTP or ""robbing"" the pot."
discgolf,3dfdg4,blackconsole,2,Wed Jul 15 22:44:13 2015 UTC,"True, but a rec player doesn't necessarily have to buy into CTP"
discgolf,3dfdg4,snappyj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:52:56 2015 UTC,"Kind of counter to the point, though.  As an Adv player you want those Rec players to pay into the CTP's so that you're throwing for $50 instead of $15.  Most of the time the more advanced players are going to take CTP anyway.  And as a Rec player, you don't want to feel like you're donating money to the Adv players every week, and having you or a Rec peer take down the CTP more often is a great way to keep encouraging CTP participation."
discgolf,3dfdg4,blackconsole,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:33 2015 UTC,"The whole set up for this league was because the ""Cash"" leagues at the Pay to play course is pretty clicky and is almost set up to cash farm lower level players.  The attitudes are poor with some players too because they don't want to help lower skilled players because they are competition.  We wanted something to bring people together.  This league our Advanced players don't get handicaps.  It's the type of course that you can throw -3 one week and +7 the next.  We've had different Advanced winners each week.    The cash leagues that already exist here have a 70% of the average of your last three rounds handicap.  If you consistently shoot under par you have a 0 handicap.  This is a disadvantage to lower skills because the newer players have to constantly do much better than their average just to get a Par score.  While those who can play a bad game and still be under 0 have no challenge.  Just free money.  We don't want a cash farm.  We want a community.  The bigger leagues exist and without complaint from us.  We just wanted to offer something that was more friendly but still offered something in the middle for everyone."

Also north of Beaumont there is Lumberton dgc. It is a fun course, but it has costly OB.

In Z plastic, I can use it for some awesome rollers that get me out of any situation and it has some real nice stability to it. It flies pretty much dead straight, minus the slightest S curve to it. I would definitely check them out. Latitude 64 has some awesome plastic that I like easily as much, if not more than Innova.

I throw buzzz's and have an understable, stable, over stable and a OS buzzz for really overstable. That's all the mids I'll ever need but I use them all fairly efficiently.

discgolf,3deh2v,Sideshowxela,2,Wed Jul 15 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"There is also a pretty rough formula, you could work out what your speed is based on how far you are throwing it.    For example, a disc thrown correctly and efficiently at a speed of 50 mph is likely to travel about 300 feet. Reaching a distance of 400 feet or more requires a disc speed of around 70 to 75 mph.    But if you are just trying to see what is giving the most gains, you might want to make an investment in a high FPS camera, one that will shoot 240fps or higher, then you can analyze form in excruciating detail and weed out the poor moves."

discgolf,3deh2v,M0b1u5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"I am happy to help with any radar questions. There are a lot of choices out there, but you should keep in mind that not all radar guns operate the same way. Since a ball or disc, slows down rapidly in flight due to air resistance you need to be aware of ""when"" the measurement is taken. A police radar is looking for a car that is in motion for a long time and changes speeds fairly slowly. You really want a sports radar designed for measuring an object that is in flight like a ball or disc. Then you need to make sure that it has a fast enough acquisition time to get the speed right at the release point. The radar guns designed for professional baseball training or scouting do this well. The Jugs, Stalker Sport and Ball Coach radar models are all designed to get the speed right at release before it slows down. For instance, the Ball Coach radar makes new measurements at a rate of 50 times a second. There is a reason why these kinds of radars are more expensive. There are many lower cost radars out there that do not update fast enough to get the speed until the object has slowed down significantly. The problem with these radars is that measurements on multiple throws may be made at different random points in the flight so it is hard to compare speeds from throw to throw.     You can use stop watch methods and calculations, this is what the smart-phone apps do. The problem is that you can only get the average speed over the flight and not the top release speed. These are also prone to large errors due to the human reaction time being a significant part of the timing.     High speed camera techniques can also work if you are careful to have a good reference for distance and you are careful about the parallax errors. Let me know if I can do anything else to help.

Driving putters tend to be swapped out every once in a while, typically whenever I get a new pretty one I want to put in the bag. I've never tried a Plasma Ion, so that's next on the list."

Plus I just like to buy Ions, so I'll eventually pick one up in every plastic and stamp variation.  At this point, my bag is pretty much set, so I'm not buying out of need, just for fun. My putting putter is a Neutron Ion I bought 3 years ago when N came out - I'll never putt with another putter and this thing just gets better and better."

I'm sure it'll wear down faster than I'd like but if I throw it on the anny it does nicely. Maybe a teebird or teebird3 thrown on an anny, just expect some late fade for sure.  Also it will help to do field work with what's already in your bag and try to throw that shot. Or just grab a driver, mid, and putter and go throw a round.

I know a guy who throws lefty and putts righty. That said if you have practiced righty before id stick with it. Slow down your motion and concentrate on being smooth, that throw was rather choppy. If you throw at half speed but its smooth you will likely have less strokes per round than if u force it to full speed. Get you muscle memory set at a snails pace before speeding up. Personally i made my fiancee throw from a standstill for 3 years. She now throws a solid 200ft standstill drive dead straight at exactly 12 ft elevation nearly 90% of the time."

I've been able to get 200ft drives this way pretty consistently though I'm still skying pretty frequently. I think focusing on keeping everything very slow will probably help."
discgolf,3ddmqk,LeftyHyzer,2,Wed Jul 15 15:11:24 2015 UTC,"Before you move to a ""one step"" throw as you are describing i would suggest you practice in a field a bit from the actual stand still. feet in throwing position, rotate your hips backward and accelerate through your shot. Then after a few of those move back to the 1 step. then a 2 step, and eventually u will be in a full run up."

discgolf,3dei16,5in1K,2,Wed Jul 15 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"Ergo2 by Big Hyzer is, in my humble opinion, the best backpack style bag on the market for my needs.  Crazy lightweight - I haven't found another backpack that's even really close to as light.  Disc space - can carry way more than you should be carrying anyhow.  Fit - I'm 5'10"", 150-160 pounds, medium athletic build. I have the straps mostly cinched down so that the bag rides fairly high on my bag. The design seems to distribute the weight perfectly. It feels more like I'm wearing a coat than carrying a bag. I can go all day playing and my back never gets tired the way it used to with old bags (innova, fade, simian).  Rainfly - hands down, best on the market for effectiveness, ease of use, and accessibility.  Company/customer service - Big Hyzer has gone above and beyond in their service to their customers. A friend of mine had a minor defect in his bag, he alerted the company, and they sent him a new one without even making him return the defective one. Another friend of mine is petite (5'1""? Maybe, maybe 115pounds ?) and he made a custom one for her that was a little smaller in some proportions to fit her better - and he didn't charge an arm and a leg to do it.  I know others are recommending products that are all fine in their own right, but I think you would be making a mistake if you didn't at least consider Big Hyzer.

discgolf,3dei16,5in1K,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:51 2015 UTC,Since November/early December.  I have a couple of small issues with it that apparently have been fixed in the current version.  Even with them it's a really good bag.

discgolf,3dei16,AKAChickenHawk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:01:35 2015 UTC,If you want to try a backpack bag for cheap check out the Magellen bag from academy sports. I've only played one round with mine so far but it felt no different than my light hiking pack. Very comfortable and tons of room. And for $30 shipped you're not out much.

discgolf,3ddcsx,Lovemesomediscgolf,2,Wed Jul 15 15:44:04 2015 UTC,Harmon Hills is fantastic and if you ask Aaron & Meredith will let you camp  by the 7th hole which is what I did. Knoxville does have some great courses. Best way to meet up with the locals is to get on that city's disc golf Facebook page and ask to couch surf with the locals. There are clubs all over the place and many of them have league matches once or twice a week. You can also go to my website at www.DiscGolfAdventures.us to see the courses with a drone fly over and a first person perspective of the individual holes. Best of luck!

discgolf,3dcq8f,Skeeow,5,Wed Jul 15 14:13:25 2015 UTC,He said it was about negative feedback from the community.

What happened?   Chad & Brad at MVP are awesome, it wasn't that...  I've had trolls for over half a decade. If that was going to stop me, it would have in 2010. My logo itself was mocking them. DGWYSO.  Close your eyes. Imagine waking up to the perfect day. Perfect weather. You have the day off. Just got paid. What do you want to do? The answer, for a lot of you, is play disc golf. The answer for me, is ride my road bike. Hobbies come and go. Soccer. Karate. Basketball. BMX. Football. Aggressive Inline.  Weightlifting. Photoshop. Photography. Guns. Cooking. Programming. Skateboarding. Chess. Video games. I do the things I do because that's what I love. That's what drives me. That's what puts a smile on my face. Disc Golf is not that thing anymore. it hasn't been for over half a year. When a hobby feels like a job rather than a passion, it drains you. My heart hasn't been in it since fall 2014. There are reasons why, but that's not important now. What is important is that everyone finds what they love to do, and they do it with all their heart. I can't keep myself in the world of disc golf for you. If it doesn't make me happy, it's empty. I'm leaving all of it. I'm going to do what I love. I hope every person reading this has something they love. Something they're passionate about. That makes them happy. It's an important thing to have in life. I wish you all the best, and your support over the years means so much to me.   Peace =)"

discgolf,3dcq8f,MysticalMuffDiver,4,Wed Jul 15 13:26:59 2015 UTC,You already lost. He created a temp account called lolmikecsucks yesterday and deleted it after exchanging a few messages with me.
discgolf,3dcq8f,colucc43,3,Wed Jul 15 14:18:33 2015 UTC,What did he have to say?
discgolf,3dcq8f,MysticalMuffDiver,4,Wed Jul 15 14:19:37 2015 UTC,He wasn't happy that about a comment thread yesterday. He had overlooked a request from me to play disc golf one day. I had just moved to Charlotte and recognized a course from his videos.   It was just a big misunderstanding. He thought I was saying he ignored a request to play that was made in person. Overlooking a message happens when you are a guy of his status. Once he explained that and said sorry he was done messaging and the account was deleted.   I have never met him in person but he was very nice in the messages yesterday once he realized I wasn't trying to slander his name. He doesn't deserve the jokes at his expense but sadly I think this video is going to further perpetuate the negative circle jerk towards the guy.
discgolf,3dcq8f,Skeeow,6,Wed Jul 15 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"He may not deserve jokes at his expense, but he's most definitely asking for the attention he's getting, negative or otherwise. His best course of action if he didn't want negative feedback would have been to just quietly stop posting videos."

discgolf,3dcq8f,DGweekly,3,Wed Jul 15 09:51:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, theyre all private. I got bored yesterday at work and searched out one of the times his videos were posted here and it said ""This video is private."" If it were unlisted it would have played like normal because I was following a link to it. Not sure what the logic was behind making them all private though. I guess he wants literally nothing to do with disc golf anymore?"
discgolf,3dcq8f,Skeeow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:17:21 2015 UTC,Because he wants you to ask him to put them back up. It's about validation.
discgolf,3dcq8f,colucc43,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:42:34 2015 UTC,A rather selfish move.
discgolf,3dcq8f,dickspace,2,Wed Jul 15 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"I subscribed to his Youtube channel.  He posts a lot of mountain biking and weightlifting and video game stuff. His DG videos are always great for us the viewers, but I can see how a guy like him gets bored with it. He has the talent but not the drive to compete."
discgolf,3dcq8f,Benfts,2,Wed Jul 15 18:36:25 2015 UTC,Hey MikeC if you're seeing this hit me up. I took 18 months off DG to ride track and fixed alley competitively. I'm interested to see what you can do on a fixie or a free wheel.
discgolf,3dcq8f,Benfts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:16:32 2015 UTC,But I didn't take down all my YouTube videos when I left.....  drops mic...
discgolf,3dcq8f,MysticalMuffDiver,5,Wed Jul 15 23:17:09 2015 UTC,This is unbelievably pretentious. People are confused because the videos are private and they were a useful tool and this is not a real answer to why the videos are private. You can have other hobbies and not completely shut down an old one. Odds are people could care less if he is interested in disc golf anymore. It's kind of a dick move to put everything out there for people to use and then snatch it away when you see fit.
discgolf,3dcq8f,splanky47,8,Wed Jul 15 14:24:46 2015 UTC,It is odd. But he is the one that put the effort into making the videos. He should be able to do what he wants with them.
discgolf,3dcq8f,jacetheace517,3,Wed Jul 15 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"That depends on his relationship with MVP too. It could be argued if they gave him lots of free plastic to use in his videos, that the plastic was payment for services, and the videos were the service to grow their brand. If they wanted and had a good lawyer they may be able to file a civil suit claiming they actually own those videos since they paid him to make them.  That being said if he never had a discussion of that type with MVP it might not be valid, just depends on the nature of their relationship."
discgolf,3dcq8f,ZAMson,7,Wed Jul 15 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"Ha, this is a non-issue.  He made videos because he enjoyed it, and got supported with free plastic for all the free advertising that resulted.  We had fun watching what he could do with them, and as creative people ourselves we respect him as a content creator.  There's no ill will towards him, and those videos were never made as a contract project.  It was like, send him discs, see what he does with them.  His reviews of other brands were never a problem either, nor was his inclination toward playing outside the tourney world.  If those videos had been made FOR the company, then they would've been hosted on venues we controlled.  He did this for fun and MVP was lucky he had fun with MVP stuff for so long.  There's nothing more powerful than someone being genuine about something they enjoy."
discgolf,3dcq8f,jacetheace517,2,Wed Jul 15 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, which is why I said it would depend on the relationship. It isn't outside the realm of possibility that what I was suggesting could've been true, but I never claimed it was.  Glad to hear that isn't the case though, it wouldn't make much sense from MVP's side."
discgolf,3dcq8f,bert_and_earnie,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:00 2015 UTC,He made MVP a ton of money. I bought at least a dozen discs because of his videos.
discgolf,3dcq8f,12jammydodgers,2,Wed Jul 15 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Mike blew up overnight, and was unprepared for it. He went from being a guy who played with his friends, who made one video to prove he could jam putters super far, to being expected to compete at the highest level. Talent isn't everything, especially if you don't want to use it."
discgolf,3dcq8f,eastlakebikerider,6,Wed Jul 15 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"Not exactly correct.  The videos he posted showed him (apparently) duecing every hole on the course - in every video.  Which led to the question - 'Why aren't you playing on the pro tour with a game like that'.  The only rated round he has documented is low 900's rated with some kind of drama about having a busted hand at the time.  Expectations were kind of set by his videos, which he was never able to really back up.  He can crush it and has been very helpful to others looking for form advice, but he seems to be a drama magnet."
discgolf,3dcq8f,DGweekly,6,Wed Jul 15 17:00:10 2015 UTC,"I'm gunna defend Mike a little bit here, fair warning this might be a long post. His and my channel are fairly similar, we both mainly focused on reviewing/demonstrating how new discs fly. Mike did lots of form and improving your game type stuff as well, while I try and stay away from it because quite frankly I'm not good at it. Looking at someone's form I could tell you if it was good, bad, or somewhere in between, but I don't know the proper steps/drills to becoming the next Paul McBeth. Back on the real topic of him looking better in his videos than in real life. Of course that's gunna happen, it happens with me to some degree, but I've never claimed to be anything above an MA2 player. In a review video who wants to see me, or Mike, shank a drive into a tree? Or not put enough on an anny and it just stalls out and dumps left? Nobody. That sort of stuff is always going to get cut. The standards get bumped up even higher when someone (MVP in Mikes case, DD for me, but that's only certain videos) is sending you things for your videos. Whether it be money or product, youve now got more people counting on you to make your videos to be better and better. People want to see the disc flying, so naturally you're going to be putting in the best shots you filmed. Each video is almost like a mini highlight reel if you will. I think the issue Mike had was his shots were so good, and he threw so far that people expected more of him."
discgolf,3dcq8f,FRESH_WAVE,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"Only some of the videos were strictly for product review, but there were plenty of videos on Mike's channel that were full rounds with graphics that showed his score. With that being said, I still won't deny that he was definitely super good at disc golf. Maybe not good enough to nail every single 40-60' putt like his videos show, but definitely good."
discgolf,3dcq8f,rhatton1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:30:40 2015 UTC,"Very well said. The other point to make is however good your form is, competitions are won and lost by a solid mental game not by the player with best form. My current rating is somewhere just over 900. playing on a regular basis at local nights with the top players in the country I expect and do beat them with rounds 1000 rated + (scores taken against Pdga rounds on the same layout) come a pdga competition though they still shoot 1000 rated rounds. I don't. Metal game Trumps Form All day long"
discgolf,3dcq8f,12jammydodgers,4,Thu Jul 16 08:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the first vid he posted, on DGCR, to back up some comments he posted about being able to push his putters over 300'. He posted a YouTube video titled Anteboruem with Anodes or something similar, was immediately picked up by MVP, and everyone online began expecting great things from him. Guy was a recreational player who got pulled into something larger, the end result is understandable."
discgolf,3dcq8f,FRESH_WAVE,2,Wed Jul 15 17:14:14 2015 UTC,He was posting disc golf videos well before that though. I remember watching his videos before the Anode was even produced.

discgolf,3d9j1g,doubleak47,22,Tue Jul 14 15:40:50 2015 UTC,From the design and size it looks to be thrown exclusively with a forehand. I bet Wysocki could throw this thing farther than I can drive
discgolf,3d9j1g,idgaf2050,6,Tue Jul 14 16:18:40 2015 UTC,from what i gather from the video it looks like you wrap your index finger around the edge of the chip then throw it. like a hockey puck. I may actually pick one up. they would be fun to toss around and take up virtually no space. great idea. Takes the mini and makes it throwable for the average joe.
discgolf,3d9j1g,red_beanie,35,Tue Jul 14 16:39:11 2015 UTC,then throw it. like a hockey puck.    I don't think you're playing hockey correctly....

If you lose a disc you have about 3-5 min to find it before you need to let people start playing through.   It isn't the big burden you make it seem to turn in someone's disc. You simply turn the disc into the pro shop and they give you $1. The pro shop then calls the disc owner and it is $2 to pick it up from the shop. One dude gets a free snickers, and you get your disc back for a $2 finders fee. All without making your golf buddies wait 20 min while you fish in a bush."
discgolf,3dcgml,codeByNumber,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"That's a nice setup, but I still don't like the mindset of, ""I lost my disc, didn't spend the time required to find it, so now it's someone else's responsibility to return it to me.""    I never mark my discs, because if I lose site of it, and quit looking, that should be on me, and if someone else finds it, that's their reward."
discgolf,3dcgml,Notorious21,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"Who says anything about that being the finders responsibility ti return the disc? If you can't be bothered to send a text, just throw it into the middle of the fairway where it might be found by someone who does not have a problem assuming such a ""burden"".   And you are forgetting the additional paragraph "" - because I would do the same for them. Saving us both a lot of lost time and aggravation on average."""
discgolf,3dcgml,bombmk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about what I would do, I'm talking about what I should expect of others.  I abandon my property in public, the last thing I want is for someone else to feel the obligation to return it. They can just keep it if it doesn't mean enough to me to keep looking for."
discgolf,3dcgml,Notorious21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:50:27 2015 UTC,"How do I know how much the other guy kept looking for it?  And again: There is no obligation to return it. There is an obligation to inform the owner that you have it, so he can make arrangements to pick it up - or make the decision not to. Just like any other piece of property that someone might have forgotten/mislaid/lost.  And such an obligation is to everyone's advantage and is fair and reasonable - which is why I have no qualms about expecting it. If someone cannot handle the burden of such an ""obligation"" I would, frankly, hope they stay away from disc golf courses.  Just today I had a text exchange that went like: ""I have a Prodigy D3 with your number in it"" ""Cool - I looked for it everywhere! Are you playing (current) course this weekend?"" ""Not likely. I can leave it under the (specific) trashcan for you?"" ""Super. I will pick it up tomorrow. Thanks a lot! I appreciate it""  Makes me happy to help and it made him happy to get it back. On top of that he would not waste time going back to look for a disc that was already found. And I hopefully won't either, the next I can't find one of mine. I have even texted people to let them know their disc was destroyed when the park people moved the grass/rough - for the same reason.  In the end it saves time for everyone and keeps the discs in the hands that knows them best."

Perfect condition: 75-100$    Good Condition: 30-50$    Thrower Condition: 15-25$ depending on the stamp    Poor Condition: 10-15$ If someone wants one just to have a cool practice putter.    Edit: this old DX plastic tends to clean up VERY nice with a light scrub using a magic eraser. I have even taken off magic marker that covered entire discs with enough persistence. I would suggest lightly scrubbing the top of the disc using just warm water, if that doesnt work a drop of dawns soap can help. Stay away from the stamp tho, they can rub off easier than you might think."

discgolf,3db7fn,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"Well that would be absolute top end. Most likely for a max weight rainbow stamp in a less common color plastic, or something unique like that. I happen to collect 150 class stamped discs however and own 3 aviars. One is trashed, bought it for 10$. One is halfway decent, prob 6-7/10. i payed 35$. One is mint and ive had forever, i wouldnt take less than 80$ and still prob wouldnt sell since i collect specifically 150 class discs. Thats a nice aviar for sure. Cool color/stamp combo."

Basically it is a beat River.    As far as the Spark goes, I haven't thrown it much, but I'd say it it is less stable than my XXX and with better glide. In my limited experience with the disc, I'd use the Spark for OS shots that are too long for the XXX or  and too short for a Giant."

I do get doggy drool on my discs from time to time, but it's worth it.

discgolf,3d90ra,dubyat,15,Tue Jul 14 13:14:06 2015 UTC,"Everything I write is from a RHBH or LHFH point of view.  You release a disc with hyzer. That means the outside edge of the disc is pointing down. Like this /.  Normally if you throw like this the disc would go left. I you put enough speed into the disc you get High Speed Turn(HST). As the disc hits the HST portion of its flight, it turns to the right and comes out of the hyzer.  Now there are a few different flavors of hyzerflips. You could flip it from hyzer to flat, and have it go dead straight or fade back to the left at the end. You could turn it over more and have it finish right. The max distance shot is turning it over, and them having it come back to the left at the end. That is called an S curve.  S curves often need a lot of vertical and horizontal room to work, but they go very far."
discgolf,3d90ra,Awalrod,20,Tue Jul 14 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"everything you wrote is correct, however, you didn't mention that you need an understable disc."
discgolf,3d90ra,Skier420,11,Tue Jul 14 13:55:45 2015 UTC,"Or rather an over stable disc won't flip much if at all. The less stable the disc, the more it will turn over from hyzer to flat and past to anhyzer."

discgolf,3d90ra,LaserBeamHorse,7,Tue Jul 14 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"Well, Kite and XD would probably be easiest ones to hyzerflip, since they are slow and very understable."

discgolf,3d90ra,Douchee_McGee,5,Tue Jul 14 18:27:15 2015 UTC,Seems solid to me.
discgolf,3d90ra,Agent_Zoil,7,Tue Jul 14 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"I've been throwing for 2 years and still can't hyzer-flip very well. My long drives are 360-380' (600' on the internet). My issue is mostly form. My hyzer flip attempts end up as just plain hyzers most of the time. I'm working on it.  That being said, your River is ideal for hyzer flipping. It's almost as if the disc was made for it (might need to break it in a bit if it's new). Depending on your arm strength, heavier discs will be harder to flip."
discgolf,3d90ra,ilikemyteasweet,6,Tue Jul 14 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"I guarantee it's your follow through.   When throwing a hyzer, your arm finished in the hyzer plane, heading upward. Not enough to make your disc stall, but enough to create that hyzer flight path.  For a hyzerflip, you want your arm to continue on a flat plane for your follow through, as you would for a flat shot. It takes focus, and some practice to ensure that's what your body is actually doing. You want to make sure that your arm stays on the same plane all the way through your reachback, release, and finish. Never coming up above your shoulder.  To really see it as you practice, I'd use a very US mid. It's like a light bulb coming on when you finally figure it out. And it's awesome to see off the teebox."
discgolf,3d90ra,Agent_Zoil,3,Tue Jul 14 19:04:28 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the tip! My Claymore might be the perfect disc to practice with.
discgolf,3d90ra,ilikemyteasweet,5,Tue Jul 14 20:31:13 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, if you have something more US, use that.  My Claymore will flip,  but I'm glad I didn't learn how to do it with one."

discgolf,3d90ra,bties,2,Fri Jul 17 04:05:33 2015 UTC,"That's sort of relative.  I have a stupid amount of snap on my throws and decent power (500+ ft), and only my most overstable discs (felon, firebird, giant) won't hyzerflip on me.  I regularly hyzerflip a champ boss, lucid escape, star destroyer, star teebird, etc.  It's all about the force you put into a disc.  I can't even throw understable discs, they usually just dump right."

discgolf,3da42j,Myndflyte,6,Tue Jul 14 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"I have been playing for 7 years now and I still have some light weight disc(Driver only).  I don't have an arm like everyone else, so the light weight allows me to get the distance I want."
discgolf,3da42j,yesiam8833,4,Tue Jul 14 19:10:05 2015 UTC,I throw 140 drivers.. they have helped my game...once I got the hang of them.
discgolf,3da42j,Billery,3,Tue Jul 14 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"Light weight discs usually flip easier. If you like hyzerflips, then pick up some 150 gram drivers. I have two DX Destroyers at 150 grams, and one Blizzard Champion Ape at 120 grams, they are what I use for hyzerflips for tunnel shots and wide open distance."

discgolf,3da42j,pjbball04,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:32 2015 UTC,"I think it depends a lot on the physical strength and prior athletic ability of the newbie. If they're new to sport in general, and have all the throwing form of a Tyrannosaurus, and noodle arms because they've never picked up anything heavier than money, then hell yeah, start at 150g. Otherwise, you may be on to something."
discgolf,3da42j,Novaova,2,Tue Jul 14 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"For no wind and downwind ONLY!  I bag a 156gm VIP Air King, and it is by far the longest discs I have ever thrown. But even 10kph of headwind will wreck it.  Lightweight discs are great for people with slower arms, and women, and children.  I have a new player here in town, who is 65 years old, and mad keen on DG. He only needs a little guidance now and then, because he is so dedicated to developing Great Form - and he throws all light plastic, and it really works for him.  But, for ""normal"" males, with average strength and speed, there is no need to ""lighten up"" your bag though. A couple of lightweight discs are always handy for those crushing drives in no wind or tailwind - but it would be a mistake to get all lightweights."
discgolf,3da42j,M0b1u5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"i regularly give new players 150g discs, they not only hold lines a bit better than max weight discs but also are easier to generate armspeed with. My girlfriend throws 150g kc pro gazelles and 150g dx sharks. She loves them both and they are very good at revealing any flaws in her game. Training with them can be very helpful but i dont think they are to be considered permanent discs in the long term. They are bad in wind, and beat in alot faster, but nothing is better for field training basics."
discgolf,3da42j,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"Selectively helpful.   The reason for this is that it's based on wind and elevation. Here in Florida, we have a constant seabreeze, so as long as the wind is <7-8mph, a 150 disc will work. I still throw a few 150 distance drivers (Insanity and the occasional Fission Volt).   In terms of weight, I'd stay below 165g starting out. Anything more heavy and it can cause issues with elbows and shoulders."
discgolf,3db0jr,Hthomasmagic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:47:51 2015 UTC,"I think you should bring your up arm across your chest more. You drop it right before your throw.  Edit: from an athletic point of view, your step up is pretty flat footed. You should be on your toes more. Look at Paul McBeth shuffle before he throws. I am pretty sure he does this to stay on his toes."

discgolf,3dbm75,strider415,2,Wed Jul 15 12:22:28 2015 UTC,"For simple cuts, which I assume you will be doing, you can't go wrong with Windows Movie Maker. It's very amateur, but if that's what you are there is nothing wrong with it.   In a pinch, I have used GoPro's Editing Software before. It's not great, but does do what you need. I should note that you do not have to use a GoPro camera to use this software. It recognizes very common file types.   I've heard of Lightworks before and it might be a pretty good option. It looks like a step above the others, although I have never used it personally so I cannot say for sure.   Someone else suggested Adobe Premiere Pro. For only a small monthly fee you get one of the best pieces of software out there. I do this for a living and use it daily.   I hope this helped. Remember, whichever one you go with, there are a plethora of YouTube videos to help get you started."

I already put it in correct order in Movie Maker, now I just need to edit out some of the scrap before and after shots.  The only other thing I want to learn how to do is a ""After hole X, scores are now ____"" kind of like what you'd do with a real DG video, so my friends watching can see the status as the round goes on. That'll be the only thing I need to learn how to do. Other than that, removing a second or two of each clip and throwing music behind it shouldn't be too hard.  Thanks for the info and the time."

(i had used my cell phone, in a few different moments of the video, the video captured is trash) Any insight into $200 or so (or even less) cameras to do this well, or are you a software/editing guy mostly?

discgolf,3dbm75,DGweekly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"While there are literally dozens of options for a good camera, I think I would recommend a GoPro. It's the amateur videographers best friend, especially for sports. It shoots ultra HD, Slow Motion, and comes in a waterproof case. The newer models can even be controlled from your phone. The downsides of this camera would be poor battery life and no screen. It's more of a point and shoot.   If you're looking for some other options, I would look at the Kodak Playsport. It's an older camera that really crisp.   Another option would be a Flip HD. Similar to the playsport, but I like it less.   If you have any other questions, pass the my way."

discgolf,3d9c0m,klemle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:23 2015 UTC,Just practice and figure out the stance that works for you. I started out using a McBeth type stance and it was ok but I decided to try a Barsby type stance and all of a sudden I was hitting so many more chains.   It's just a matter of figuring out what works for you and then practice it until you are blue in the face.
discgolf,3d9c0m,Myndflyte,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"Comfortable, confident, and control. Develop a simple routine to address your lie and get yourself in a comfortable position. Focus in on one single chain link as you exhale with confidence. Clean release with a good ""finger pop"" is the control. Meaning every really good putter has that clean release and pop. Putting is a consistent continual battle. 90% mental."

My personal form has gone through some revisions over the years but it's still my own form and not necessarily copied. I play with formwork I see from different pros but for the most part learning my own game and gaining confidence in my own throws is where it's at for me.  Of course... practice, practice, practice. I like to start at 10' until I make X number of putts, then back up to 15' and do it again, then 20', then 25' then 30' etc. I do this with roughly 6 putters and it has greatly improved my accuracy and thus my confidence."

Even the pros can get things wrong, sometimes what they say differs from what they actually do.  Keep what you like, drop what you don't.

As far as the drivers, I occasionally use them for backhand, but thats maybe 1/10 times, as i have two other backhand drivers i like more (northman and renegade).

I've been playing like 4-7 times a week and have been trying to improve my game a lot. I had been seeing a lot of love for MVP on here so I picked up a Proton Inertia and a used Neutron Amp from my local store. I was throwing the Inertia really well until I grip locked it way right into a swamp. I was thinking of getting a Tesla to replace it or maybe a little higher speed if I could handle it, and maybe an eclipse tangent as well.   Thoughts? I'm not too familiar with stable/overstable yet, will these be ok for a semi-beginner?"
discgolf,3d8u6w,DG_noob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend a Tesla to a beginner, unless perhaps you favor a forehand throw or have already developed a strong backhand.  If not you'll find it burning into the ground really quickly out of your hand.  the Tangent will probably fit in your bag much more comfortably since it's fairly understable/neutral and can service a lot of lines."
discgolf,3d8u6w,arkiverge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"I throw RHBH, haven't put much work into my forehand shot yet. I've thrown the inertia before and was doing pretty well with it until I lost it. Would you recommend another Inertia if I don't get a call for my lost one? I was looking at their flight charts on mvp's site and it seemed like the tesla was similar to the inertia with just a bit more distance."
discgolf,3d8u6w,DG_noob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"I throw both the Inertia and the Tesla and the Tesla is significantly more stable.  You know how how at the beginning of the Interia's throw if you put some zip on it the disc pulls to the right a bit and then at the very end fades to the left?  Well, the Tesla will pull almost none to the right (especially brand new) and start fading to the left much, much sooner resulting in a significantly shorter overall throw with similar power.  Long story short, I'd recommend the Inertia again, unless you have enough juice to get a disc out to 350ft+, in which case the Tesla might be fine for you too."

One is 176g and the other is 179g (don't tell anyone)  They are my go-to fairway drivers as they pretty much stay on what line I put them on for 85% of their flight. The 179g will finish left more than the other one.  As far as what shots I use them for, pretty much anything in the 265-315 range that doesn't require a hard left finish and does not have a low ceiling. Since they have so much glide, I've found they do better if you can get them up in the air a bit.  As I am typing this, I am realizing I really am not able to hyzer-flip mine. I am going to look into a lighter option strictly for hyzer-flipping."

discgolf,3d8ypl,markbuch,12,Tue Jul 14 13:10:08 2015 UTC,You have to be able to take criticism when doing stuff like this but some of the jokes I've seen in this sub are just at his expense and uncalled for.
discgolf,3d8ypl,MysticalMuffDiver,9,Tue Jul 14 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"From the time I've been here, this is probably the 3rd or 4th time he's done this.  It just seems so odd to me how he deletes his account each time. Is he so upset(if thats even what it is) with the community that he has to DELETE his account? Why not just.. not post? It's pretty funny to me at this point just because he always ends up making a new account and coming back anyway.    Though I can understand removing all the video's off of his youtube page if he's trying to do his own site so he can have all the traffic go there."
discgolf,3d8ypl,Bretamaled,3,Tue Jul 14 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"But what's he going to do? Host the videos himself? Youtube's video player is pretty much the gold standard. He'd be better off just embeding the youtube videos on his site (which you can't do if they're private). If his goal is to make money with ads on his website, he could just put ads in his youtube videos.  But if he posts interesting content on his site, then I'll go check it out."
discgolf,3d8ypl,Myndflyte,2,Tue Jul 14 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"In Mikes defense, if his goal is to make money off the videos it's a very real possibility for him to make more with ads on his own website. If thats his plan, hes gone about it perfectly. Use youtube (by far the largest video streaming website) to build up a large following, then move that following over somehwere where you will get paid better. Nobody is making it rich posting disc golf videos to youtube, especially not as infrequently as Mike posted."
discgolf,3d8ypl,DGweekly,6,Tue Jul 14 16:57:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying.  But he removed the images and everything from his YouTube page.

I was more stating how little youtube pays, especially when you only upload 1 or 2 videos a month. He could easily make more through a website than through youtube, but neither would amount to any substantial income."
discgolf,3d8ypl,Bretamaled,3,Tue Jul 14 21:45:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. I was just trying to give him some benefit of doubt and not hate too much but in the mean time I'll continue playing with my shirt on and not throwing MVP.
discgolf,3d8ypl,Myndflyte,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:17:25 2015 UTC,No hate directed his way either. It's just kind of weird how he up and left. But is it a requirement that whenever I throw my MVP/Axiom disc I need to take my shirt off? LOL.
discgolf,3d8ypl,Bretamaled,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:12 2015 UTC,If you leave your shirt on unfortunately that means you have to delete your reddit account once every 3 months.  If you take it off that means you'll be one step closer to reach your true internet distance potential!

discgolf,3d8ypl,DGTyler,4,Tue Jul 14 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"This is the interenet. For someone with a channel the size of Mikes (small in the youtube world, but big in the disc golf world) there's going to be circle jerks, trolls, and haters around every corner following you're every move. I think he had/has them so bad because of how he dealt with it early on. When he deletes his accounts the trolls think they've won, they feed on that stuff. So next time when he came back they were even stronger, and more of them. Mike deleted and remade accounts countless times, so yeah people are gunna give him shit for it. Trolls suck and nobody deserves to get trolled for everything they do, but I don't think Mike isn't entirely without blame. He could have handled it better IMO."
discgolf,3d8ypl,DGsirb1978,6,Tue Jul 14 20:54:05 2015 UTC,"It's the account deletion I don't understand. Mike spent countless hours answering people's questions here, and his answers keep getting results in Google/reddit searches - so by deleting his account he's actually hurting the sport he loves, because suddenly all that good stuff is [DELETED].  Well screw it - I'm going to shamelessly rip off the video and create my own power grip tutorial, and expand on Mike's ideas. I have a tweak to his grip which is extremely good at improving grip without using muscle strength.  I have thick enough skin to ignore the haters. So my videos won't ever be pulled."
discgolf,3d8ypl,DGsirb1978,2,Tue Jul 14 21:59:26 2015 UTC,"That's weird. As I understood it he moved from here (Canton, Ohio) to start competing in more tournaments. That was the reason for his signature Disc was to help pay for his move.  He's a cool guy. We met him a few times while he still lived here. I did see his stand offish completely ignore you moods a couple of times. Never really thought much of it. We all have those days.   I agree though, for him to remove all of his videos, all the images from the YouTube profile, delete his Reddit account, his website is no longer active. Something definitely seems off.

(I am in no way a health care professional or in any field remotely related to it, mental or otherwise) No question he can throw far though, I just kind of lump him in with Holly and (unfortunately) Simon these days, more of a performer/spokesperson/ambassador than a true competitor.

He's been more about the instruction and chill casual round vids, which have value IMO."
discgolf,3d8ypl,DGweekly,3,Tue Jul 14 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"No defense needed, my comments were not attacks, just my observations and opinions.  Mike and Holly have both subscribed to the ""fake it til' you make it"" philosophy that is so popular today, putting marketing over substance to promote themselves, and that can rub a lot of people the wrong way, especially when it isn't backed up.  Mike exasperated his problems by making a big deal in a protracted thread about ""what tournaments should I play"" over on DGCR and then never following through, and there are always excuses with him... the poor tournament showing referred to elsewhere in this thread he blamed on headaches/migraines IIRC, and then he pulled out of another big tournament because of a broken finger, but was able to post new videos of him throwing just a couple days later on his youtube channel... While he may not be interested in competing now, he certainly created the impression early on that he was and it is that disparity that has created a lot of ill will with people I think.  Simon has all the physical tools and is amazing to watch: the right body type and years of practice and muscle memory from playing since he was a little kid have created someone with probably the most physical potential in the sport. He gets lots of praise for his drives and trick shots, but his putting is laser sharp as well. On the other hand, he does not have the mental game to be a champion right now. His recent blog post echoes what I saw in person at the GBO this year and what I've seen on video a couple times since. He needs a coach to reign him in a bit and become more disciplined if he really wants to beat McBeth and Wysocki. The crazy shots are fun to see, but they've bit him in the ass more than they've worked this season, and until he gets the maturity and discipline required to not throw some crazy shot he's never thrown before during a tournament round he won't reach his true potential. But he is having fun with his ""flying circus"" tour, and he doesn't owe me or anyone else a d@mn thing...  (All written by this rock-solid 880ish rated player who has been playing for almost 2 1/2 years now... :)"

discgolf,3dahvc,jlu10,5,Tue Jul 14 19:38:30 2015 UTC,I would recommend a valkyrie or a leopard. Both are good for beginners and I still have them in my bag most of the time.
discgolf,3dahvc,itsmrpenguin,2,Tue Jul 14 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"I have both. The leopard got run over by a car and turns to a roller on every throw. The valk is dx and beat very under stable. Would plastic would you suggest, and how heavy?"

discgolf,3dahvc,aDramaticPause,2,Tue Jul 14 20:12:52 2015 UTC,"I agre with /u/itsmrpenguin that you need to get a valk or a leopard. I'd lean you more to the leopard. I understand that your current one was run over but that doesn't mean that, that model isn't the correct one for you. I'd get a Star Leopard and practice with that. I bet you that you'll be able to throw similar distance you do now (maybe a little tiny bit further) with more consistency.  No disc is going to get you too much farther distance, at this point finding something slower speed and potentially understable is all y you need, and the rest would probably be form improvement."

I found a discontinued Nike model at Dick's sporting goods for $15 (a steal, but a beautiful teal green) that have really done well for me.  Cons: not much ankle/arch support...

If a shoe is tight, it will fail faster, because your foot is fighting its way out with every step, and it's worse if you're doing sports in them.

discgolf,3daas1,Grgy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:08:48 2015 UTC,"Another casual measurement is a pure hyzer. It shows you have solid form and release without any ""cheat"" distance from a hyzer flip shot.  The rule of thumb I've seen here is a Comet on a hyzer out to 250'. I don't see why you can't use a Fuse. It's even less glide-y than a Comet.  I think people recommend the Comet because it's so touchy. A slight bit of misapplied force or bad form really shows itself in the Comet's flight. I haven't thrown the Fuse in awhile, but the same principles should hold.  Work for no right turn unless you wanted it, and no flutter in the beginning of the flight."
discgolf,3daas1,ilikemyteasweet,2,Tue Jul 14 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, long hyzers are the way to go. If you throw flat, it can be hard to tell if you actually threw flat or if you hyzerflipped it to some degree.  And the Fuse should work fine - it is more touchy than the Comet, I'd say."

Most people just say Fairways or Drivers to separate the two, although if you said a driver when you're throwing a fairway you'd technically be correct.  Protip: as someone who's new to the sport, stick to stuff that's speed 9 or lower, no need for any Distance Drivers yet (assuming you have standard new person skill.)"

There is definitely a point where you have too much stuff to carry, and carrying it all will decrease your performance, not increase it. That's not true if you have a caddy, obviously, but I question people's decisions to buy these monster bags.  Sure, great for tournament play, but total overkill for ordinary rounds in my view.

Sure, it was pretty awful first, but now, after a year, I'm starting to see the difference. I've cut quite a few throws from my records just by not messing up with turnover approaches :)  I use Bliz Destroyer (158) for drivers, m4 (171) for mids and Pa1(171) for putters. I actually just saw some Salient very low profile putter I might try to get cleaner release on putter FH's. Drivers go up to 300' with perfect conditions, normally at the 250 range. Between m4 and Pa1 is more about the shot I'm facing than the absolute distance. Probably they go pretty much the same."

discgolf,3dajgr,OSU09,2,Wed Jul 15 23:16:37 2015 UTC,Sounds like you aren't following through. Allow your body to spin and pivot on your foot/heel when you throw and your arm should take care of itself.

discgolf,3d7g05,chikago12,8,Tue Jul 14 05:52:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it's kind of funny.  I used to run cross country in high school.  One of our courses was at Adler Park, in good ol' Libertyville, Illinois.  We actually ran through the woods and over the tee pads, right around the baskets.  It always looked super interesting, but I never gave it a go all through high school and college, but it was always in the back of my mind.  Then a couple years ago when I was living in LA a dude was having a garage sale outside his house, and I thought, hey disc golf discs!  This would be a fun date.  So I bought 3 for a dollar each, and me and my girlfriend played Poliwog Park in Manhattan Beach (RIP).  We had a blast, and played more the next day.  Then I moved to Bristol, and my girlfriend moved to London, and I figured disc golf would be a good way to fill the void of time.  It provides me the same competitive thrill running used to get me, and just like running, it gives me an opportunity to be out in the woods, which I love.  Really glad I found this sport."
discgolf,3d7g05,Sideshowxela,2,Tue Jul 14 03:19:07 2015 UTC,"Great story, hope you find someone else to play with. Like you I love being in the woods, outside and active. It's competitive with friends and with yourself.  Wish I would have played in college too- in PA there were some cool courses. It like I said I used to just walk through them.  A dollar a disc is pretty great!"

People of all ages looked like they were having a good time. It reminded me of some baskets I'd see from the highway in my home town--suggested our high school friends fantasy football league use it to determine draft order since the cost of entry was cheap, it was competitive, and it would give us time to catch up with each other. Now our annual party has changed from a draft with disc golf to disc golf with a draft."

Greenway is a good course for casual players or skilled players, but its narrow fairways and thick rough make it tough on beginners who are trying to improve. I've shanked a few discs into the wetlands while pushing for more distance, never to return. Still, it's a nice course."

Fast forward to the age of 36, with an Office Job and a more sedentary lifestyle. I started getting out in the backyard with the neighborhood kids and throwing some crappy little ring type frisbee that you could hardly throw. I decided the kids needed something better than that, so I went out and bought a 130 gram Ultimate frisbee and bought myself a 176 Ultimate. I continued throwing/teaching the kids, and somehow started reading into Disc Golf. I studied the heck out of it for a couple weeks, then bought my first starter set (Innova), and dove head first into Disc Golf Addiction. I absolutely love it and have improved tremendously, plus love being more active again as well. I really wish I'd have gotten serious about it when I was younger now, but hey, I'm going to play for the rest of my life as long as I am able. I am now serious about form and improvement, played my first event (MVP Circuit) and came in second in my division, won a disc which was unexpected!

I'm looking for ways to break my current record, such as getting better with a wraith. I did great with it til it became understable as all hell.  My form is shaping up and my drives go further each time, and I've switched from the short sets to regular sets, as I was over shooting many of the baskets.  My weakest point is my putting, and I'm starting to get it down, and hit a few 30+ ft putts today. Still figuring out what putter I want to use, though, when I can hit putts right, everything feels great.

discgolf,3d5a0i,positive_electron42,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"This is #8 from the looks of it. It is about a 500' downhill hole with about a good 1-200' of vertical from the teepad to the hole. It is pretty easy to spot because it is just scrub down there if you don't make it to the trail.   Even if you throw a good disc you will want to throw another one, you don't get to throw holes like this that often unless you are on one of the ski resort courses."

If you ever get a chance to play Hi-View (if you look up Foothill Flyers on FB we play tags there about once every 8-10 weeks) I recommend that too. #9 is crazy, I've seen some shots go a mile or longer if the wind gets them since the tee is so high."

Turnovers out of the hand if you throw it flat, or a hyzer flip to flat, or add some power for a hyzer flip turnover.  Fairway: TP Seer. This thing is amazing for hyzer flip to turnovers that don't stop turning until they hit the ground. I'm really starting to like it after a few rounds. Effortless flips without too much turn for long controllable shots.  Distance: VIP Hatchet: Longer seer. It'll fade out if I don't put enough power on it though, so it can be hit or miss for me. The hyzer flip flex shots can go almost 400 with this guy though.  Westside discs generally run understable compared to their flight numbers so they're great for these shots."

But in all honesty it sounds like you just need to rebuild your throw the general consensus on this sub (for good reason) is to disc down and spend some time on field work.

At 200 ft you should be throwing a midrange or even a putter until you develop good snap.  A river will definitely reward good form but you have to get it to about 300 ft before it'll do anything.

discgolf,3d71zw,SearchingforSilky,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:01 2015 UTC,Work on form. Then learn how to generate more acceleration and snap when pulling through.   But seriously learn better form first. Brute strength will get you no where in this sport.
discgolf,3d71zw,aDramaticPause,2,Tue Jul 14 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"At just 200 feet you should not be throwing any disc faster than a speed 5 - standard midrange discs, and below only.   With that distance it is clear you do not pivot the disc in your hand, or grip it appropriately, or pull it through correctly.   Start with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nED7gcXobEo  I'd link to Mike Cooks Power Grip tutorial at YT - but his channel seems to have been effectively shut down: all his videos have gone private. What the hell? His other channel appears to be gone, too. :(  Basically, you have to align the disc with your forearm bones by aligning the disc between your index and forefinger, and run it along your lifeline. Push the thumb forwards, to engage the base of the thumb opposite the rear three fingers and the thumb pad opposite the index finger pinch point.  If you do it right, the top knuckle will be above the Parting Line on the disc.  Now, push downwards on your thumb so that the disc angle moves to line up with your forearm bones. You will never ever throw a disc differently to this unless you want the nose angle to be high.  By doing this, you ensure that the back side of the disc, as it pivots around, comes through at the same height as the front. Failing to push down hard results in the disc coming out nose up, and hence climbing, rapidly running out of airspeed, and then a leftwards plunge.  If you pull the disc through flat (you don't) and push the thumb down firmly, then the disc will fly outwards, rather than upwards. A disc can easily fly 100+ metres without ever being higher than 1 metre from the ground."

I like switching to the judge when my putting isn't working too well with my aviar.  Happens.  Sometimes you just have to change it up.    But seriously, get a judge.  It comes in classic soft plastic (you can taco it super easy), classic (think dx) or classic blend (a mixture of the two).  I have the soft so I can use it as a nice approach disc.    Speaking of approach putters, try the Dart.  That disc rules!  I love using it for when I have a distance put and need a lot of glide, or a great approach disc."

During reach back, it is important to get as much pull as you can so reach as far back as you can. I slowed it down to 1/4 speed and you can see that you're already pulling through as your front foot is on the ground. The second your foot is planted is when you should start your pull through. View 0:11 to see what I'm talking about. Hopefully this helps some."
discgolf,3d6yjl,The_Dancing_Lobsters,2,Tue Jul 14 00:59:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice!  So I want to be at full reach back at the same time my front foot plants?
discgolf,3d6yjl,The_Dancing_Lobsters,2,Tue Jul 14 02:53:41 2015 UTC,Thats what I was taught and has brought me distance. Hopefully it helps with you
discgolf,3d6yjl,ilikemyteasweet,2,Tue Jul 14 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"To help with getting your foot pointed mostly perpendicular, you're going to have to work on getting more turn from your hips, shoulders and head.   Your head is turning away from your target, I think because you know it's supposed to; but not because of the reason it needs to. Looking away from the target allows you to turn your shoulders back more (farther reachback, longer build-up of energy, faster release), which lets you turn your hips more. Your hips come closed (faces the camera completely) but you can go a little more. Your shoulders can go a bit more too.  Being confident in turning away from your line comes with time. I didn't like not looking where I was throwing either, but I got past it. It allows you to fully commit all that energy into the throw (but not over-muscle it). You can tell your looking up and finding you line as you plant, not trusting your body with the throw. And that only comes with time.   And you can work on it from a standstill, too.  Overall, you look like you're on the right path. Take one thing at a time and work on it. You'll have bad days. Just keep at it.  EDIT: A video I used to help me work on one thing at a time is Dan Beato's - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nED7gcXobEo. It's more the methods than a tutorial for me."
discgolf,3d6yjl,ilikemyteasweet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"Where are your eyes looking at full reach back?  Are you looking at the disc, the ground, or looking straight back?  Thank you for the help, I'm headed to the field after work today to work on this stuff!"
discgolf,3d6yjl,ilikemyteasweet,2,Tue Jul 14 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"They're not doing anything special. Just sitting straight in my head.  That's the important part. My shoulders and hips are turned so far that I'm looking 135 degrees away from my target.  (Halfway between 90 and 180, which would be facing away.)  Try pausing during your Xstep. The last foot position.  Your L foot is your plant foot. Put it 90 degrees to your line.  Now, at this point, your R foot is key. It should be 180 degrees away from the target ( pointing at the back of the teepad).   See what this does to your hips and shoulders? Turns them past the halfway point.   They bring the head with them.  Then you can swivel at the hip, which brings the shoulders around,  which brings the head around.  Your head comes up before the rest of you to see where you're throwing.  Let the shoulders bring the head instead."
discgolf,3d6yjl,The_Dancing_Lobsters,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh that makes sense.  So by pointing my right foot 180 degrees from the direction I'm throwing, I'm setting up my hips and shoulders for more turn, which will theoretically give me more power correct?"

discgolf,3d4w9y,m4ff3,5,Mon Jul 13 16:08:06 2015 UTC,First off I realized that I was doing a lot of things wrong.   My x step wasn't setting me up to get my leg and body into my throw. I was doing it because someone told me I should.   I was reaching back too far and putting pressure on my shoulder.   I was rounding the disc a lot and finishing right.   To fix these issues i watched some videos and went out and did field work to practice what was in there. A big unlock for me was getting my x step right in terms of timing and really following through on my throws.
discgolf,3d4w9y,Avoidingsnail,9,Mon Jul 13 16:13:56 2015 UTC,I had the same problem as you. The good thing is my body has a built in rounding notifier. I've got this neat thing where my shoulder dislocates every time I round bad enough.

I personally bag a Champ Firebird and a Sexton Firebird, but without being able to throw 400+ its hard to really even illicit a different result between the two.   I'd also say maybe venture into something like a Tern if you're looking to get a little crazy. I've known people who were where you are who could throw about 350 who got an additional 30-50 feet just by throwing a Tern"
discgolf,3d76fp,Auriyon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. You've got some pretty good advice. I was just out in a field throwing my discs recently, and after throwing the Firebird on a few hyzer shots, I saw that it was going almost as far as my regular drivers but with a nice left finish. Definitely something for me to remember.  Also ironic you mention the Tern because I love that disc a lot. I had one bagged for a while, and it's the most recent disc to leave my bag - only for the sake of 'discing down' and trying to rely more on slower speed stuff. You are 100% right. I threw it the same as my other ones but got another 30-50 feet out of it. The only problem is that it's pretty high speed and also understable, so if I hyzer at all it goes hard left, and if there's a lot of wind out (and I don't recognize it) it can go hard right on me. Maybe something to add back in soon. Thanks for the advice."

Personally I like the Classic Soft because its beats in quickly, and the soft plastic causes it to just hit the ground and stop. Soft plastics arent for everyone though, if you prefer a stiffer one id say the Zero Medium, or Opto.  For the Sparta, I use the Basic but it also comes in Ultrium which is very nice. The Ultrium has a touch more stability too it where the Basic will break in a little faster."

If you get it Champ, it'll start off more overstable than the numbers indicate, but it'll beat in nicely.  I like these in Gstar for ""noodle arms"" as they are under stable out of the box and have good durability.  Beast: replace with a Gstar Thunderbird.  This disc isn't much of a ""disc down"" disc in terms of overstability, in fact, it's the opposite.  It is slower though, use this disc rarely, only when you need something to fade.  The Gstar will make it less overstable and, in my experience, give it a little turn.  Boss: Put this disc away for a bit, once you can turnover your Leopard and get your Thunderbird to not fade too hard, pull it back out you'll see some amazing distance.  I used a Leopard as my primary driver for a long time and I focused on my form.  I now have a Nuke (close to your Boss) and I can throw it for a ton of distance.

It was the last hole of the game and everyone threw at once. The van drove by and people threw their discs trying to get them in. It may have been a truck, but I'm pretty sure it was a van.  If you have the option to hang a basket by a tree having a swinging basket on a short 30 ft put is always fun.   You could have a 8x4 piece of plywood about 5 feet behind the basket and have it mandatory they shoot at the wood and have the disc bounce off into the basket. The disc must hit the wood and then land in the basket for it to count as an ace, if you just hit the basket it is only metal.   A blind shot over some short trees. Have the basket about 20 feet from the pad, with a line of thick pines between the two. Make sure the pines are only 10-15ft high. Mandatory shot is above the pines, not through them.  If it's hilly an extreme up shot or down shot could be fun too."

In my opinion, its much better to put your focus further back in your hand.  For example, if you are using the regular 4 finger power grip, the lock-point is more in the middle of your hand.  So, concentrating your pressure there will be more beneficial.  In a fan grip, the contact point is more under your ring and pinkie finger (pressed into the ""drumstick"" of your thumb).  Getting that point down is crucial.  The reason I say this is because your index finger pinch isn't really important until the actual moment of release, when your wrist has flexed open.  And even then, its so fast that you couldn't possibly differentiate the moment to apply pressure.    This is not to say that your index finger/pinch is unimportant, rather that its hard to improve based on direct attention.  I think that figuring out how to flex your hand properly is more important, and the pinch will naturally follow.  To that point: I believe that when you flex your hand, the tension should be fairly steady, but gently concentrated on the focus point (above).  The steady pressure will naturally shift forward as your grip opens in the hit.  To your other point, yes, the disc will rip out of your hand.  Your goal is to take the disc on a straight line as long as possible, and get to the point of greatest acceleration.  If you are not gripping tightly, either (1) the disc will slip and come out early, (2) you will have much trouble controlling release angle, or (3) the disc will come out all wobbly.  I think that for a drive of 400' and longer, I'm holding on to the disc tight enough that you would have significant trouble removing it from my hand.  Granted, I'm only squeezing for < 1 second.  The tighter you squeeze, the longer you can hold on while the disc is accelerating.  At a certain point, you can only ever throw as far as your wrist and hand strength can endure.  When they fail, release happens.  The ejection of the disc at those speeds is essentially forced failure (bends and lets go).    There's volumes to be said about this, because its such a foundational and fundamental part of the game. I'll leave it there, but if you have any specific questions, let me know, I'll be happy to oblige."

discgolf,3d6nib,SearchingforSilky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"I guess I just need to pay more attention to my grip before release to see whether I need to apply more pressure. Right now I feel like I may be able to apply more as it's not something I've ever paid much attention to. Sounds like I just need to get out to the field and play with it a bit, maybe I'm punching just fine, I am accurate, so I definitely don't want to mess that up, I just know I have plenty of distance potential, I will work on it.  Thanks for the reply, I will be working on form a lot,I'll be sure to ask as I have more questions come up!"
discgolf,3d6nib,Sideshowxela,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:31:28 2015 UTC,"I just thought of something, have you ever had to ""choke up"" on the disc for more snap? What I mean is, if I just grab the disc naturally, when I throw, my hand won't quite be on the other side of the disc from me. So when I tee off, I will move my hand position a little farther around the edge of the disc so when I reach back my hand is positioned on the other side of the disc from my chest. Don't know if it's even neccesary or not, but it hasn't hurt anything for sure as it isn't a huge adjustment. Bad habit? Good idea? Doesn't really matter?  Thanks"
discgolf,3d6nib,SearchingforSilky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:36:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% on what you mean (probably will take a picture to be honest).  If you mean that you are curling your wrist when you throw, then I would say that is bad.   The snap comes from the extension of your wrist beyond straight, not from before straight (if that makes any damn sense at all).    Now, I will say that my hand is on the other side of the disc from my chest, but my wrist is straight.   For what its worth, my wrist stays straight from here, all the way through from there."
discgolf,3d6nib,Sideshowxela,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"Do you have the disc oriented ""between the cheeks"" along the seam of your hand, or more along where the pinky side of your palm meets your wrist? I play with my grip all the time and can't settle on anything."
discgolf,3d6nib,SearchingforSilky,2,Tue Jul 14 00:44:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure which one of those I do.  I put the disc pretty much on the ""fate line.""  It's as deep in my hand as possible and I make contact with almost all of my thumb, especially the meaty part of the ""drumstick."""

Fun, But you need a student ID if they are checking, and it's short, not really challenging. I think I shot a -4 my second play through, I average it now about 2-3 under and I'm not that great.

discgolf,3d5lwx,WhenTheRainsCome,2,Mon Jul 13 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"Discmania MD is probably the best at it, even better than a comet. It's a truly neutral disc that flies really slow and is great for showing any flaws in form."
discgolf,3d5lwx,jacobmuellerr,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think I really agree with that. As an owner of the Comet and MD, I'd say the MD is much more forgiving. Yes, both of the discs can fly the same lines, but the MD is considerably more HSS and is much less prone to turning and burning from bad form.   I'd say the Comet is still the go-to for form work. There just isn't anything as sensitive as it is in the midrange department."
discgolf,3d5lwx,Ir_77,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"I've been putting in some time with the Comet lately, and it is truly the disc that does what you make it do - OAT it and you'll know pretty quickly."
discgolf,3d5lwx,Monkeypawdog,2,Mon Jul 13 20:10:01 2015 UTC,I put in some time with the Comet also. I did actually like it for those glidey-long turnover shots that no other disc can do like the Comet does. But in the end it just wasn't HSS enough for me. I like reliability.
discgolf,3d5lwx,Ir_77,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:18:03 2015 UTC,I just hated how the comet felt as a beginner. I feel like the MD is pretty close to the flight of it but it may just be that ours just fly differently!

discgolf,3d5lwx,jacobmuellerr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:31:21 2015 UTC,"It took a long time for me to adjust, and it was the same with the Roc.  They're basically the same shape.  Deepish wing but the big dome was the main thing that affects the feel, especially with any sort of fan grip.  The other factor is the wider diameter.  It was a very frustrating process coming from shallower/smaller mids.    It helped my consistency a ton and I can't -not- recommend them since they helped my game so much and earned a spot in my bag.  A big spot too, could fit 3 drivers (maybe 4 slim MVP type drivers) in the space of two Comets!"
discgolf,3d5lwx,WhenTheRainsCome,2,Tue Jul 14 13:05:37 2015 UTC,+1 for the comet. I've done a lot of form work over the last 3 or 4 months and in the beginning I found the comet to be the most difficult disc for me to throw. I was almost always turning it over. Started throwing my putters more and working on my release and would come back to the comet once in a while and started noticing improvement.  I can now throw it flat or on a little hyzerflip and it flies really nice. but if I start to get lazy with my form it will start turning on me again and let's me know I need to correct something. It is a great disc for learning and I highly recommend it.

discgolf,3d5lwx,WhenTheRainsCome,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:09:38 2015 UTC,This is just my opinion (but keep in mind Dave Feldberg agrees :P) 150 class sharks. They will not hide any problems with your form and the light weight makes turning them over a breeze once your arm speed comes up. Also fairly easy to throw straight. I have a stack of 6 of them that i make my fiancee throw alot when we are in the field. They have really helped her form.

My Buzzz is more stable, and won't dive right with a hard RHBH throw, but you have to throw it decently hard to get a good line.  I use it for anything where I have room to allow for a decent left hook at the end of flight.  For me, it's hard to get a good line on finesse shots, so I typically only throw it hard.    Mako3 Holds any line.  Super straight flyer, but I've also found it to be fairly understable....so I have a hard time deciding I'd ever want to use it.  I've been using it for RBHB right fades, since it won't flip back left very easily.  Comet is the best of both worlds.  Not as ""heavy"" as a Buzzz, glides a lot better, doesn't have as much low speed turn, you can flip it over right for a right turn, or release it hyzer for a nice left fade.  It'll also go super straight with a slight left fade at the end.  The glide is really what sets this disc apart for me, though.   Thing just goes for miles.  MILES!!  I like my Buzzz and Mako3 for certain shots, but the Comet does everything, and it feels the best of the 3 for me.

I have tons of pics, both of every hole description on each tee (all are well detailed) and a dozen or so of cool pics of holes/turtles/etc. I'm just not sure how to post them here.  definitely worth the trip.   note: that ""forest hills"" course that comes up on the UDisc app right outside savannah doesn't exist. apparently once a week people put temporary holes in and play in a park.

discgolf,3d47le,MikeTheBlueCow,8,Mon Jul 13 11:40:43 2015 UTC,"Practice it.    You just need to isolate the body position you are in when the hip explosion happens, and work on generating more power.  A huge part is understanding how and why it happens.    First, you need to turn your back leg in, towards the target.  This movement is anatomically required to activate that part of your body.  It gets you into a runner-type position, where your back leg can flex and push your hip through.  Second, you need to activate your back leg, and push your hip through.  This is simply just a pushing with your back leg, as if you were pushing against something.  The hard part, is that those two things happen really fast.  Almost simultaneously.  But, if you aren't adding in all the complication of a disc golf throw, you can figure it out pretty easily.    Its worth pointing out that the hip turn is not a fast, or sudden as you might think.  You will practice this, and not feel like its doing much at the time.  It feels immobilized and awkward.  This is pretty normal.  Without all the other movements to maximize the energy, the hip turn is pretty tame.    Just practice, turning in, pushing through.  Turning in, pushing through.    Edit: I really need to add that all of this practice should be done with an immobilized upper body.  You really want to freeze your upper body in the proper posture.  Theres a few options, but the one that is the easiest to relate here would be to simply cross your arms across your chest, firmly.  You really want to isolate your lower body, and any arms swinging around, will complicate that.  Edit 2: I also really like the idea of conceptualizing this motion through the lens of your back hip bone.  Try to take your left hip through as fast as possible.  Imagine trying to hit something with your back hip. (This was a hitting drill we did in baseball.  Coach would hold out the handle of a bat in front of your belt buckle, you'd try to hit it with your back hip.)"
discgolf,3d47le,SearchingforSilky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:56:06 2015 UTC,Solid tips here.
discgolf,3d47le,arkiverge,3,Mon Jul 13 17:10:04 2015 UTC,Make sure when you land on your plant foot that you get your toes pointed away from the target so that your hips are naturally loaded. Then as you transfer your weight from your back foot (left for RHBH) to your plant foot you transfer from your toes to your heel.   This is one of the most helpful videos I've found as far as weight transfer/timing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0gzNIRxRbY

You could also pick up a fairway driver like a Leopard, River, or FD (my personal pick) - something glidey and a little understable - you'll probably be able to throw it farther than your Orc and Beast.  Also never hurts to practice your forehand"
discgolf,3d69ek,Auriyon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you. When I play at the lunch course I typically only bring the Mako3. I loved the TL3 as a fairway driver but lost it this weekend. I was thinking of getting another, how would your recommendations compare? As for the forehand, I am definitely practicing it. I didn't report the numbers because it's still so unpredictable,  but I'm having an odd issue. If I throw the orc or beast I get a fairly straight flight and then a good fade at the end. If I throw any of the others no matter how hard I try to throw hyzer, it always seems to come off anhyzer and usually even ends up being a roller. Obviously I have more work to do here."

I'd go with your gut if you're thinking intermediate. You sound like an intermediate player from your description. It might just be me, but I chose to skip Rec and start in Intermediate. I would rather finish in the middle in intermediate than win Rec. You say you're inconsistent to a degree, and if you have a few really hot rounds and finish 1st with 2nd 20-30 strokes behind, it's not gonna look good (Probably wouldn't occur, but I've seen 1st place in intermediate beat 90-95% of advanced and would've played 2nd/3rd in advanced. Not pretty). Even if you have a few rough rounds and place near the bottom, you'll learn more from playing with intermediates. TLDR: I'd say intermediate. You can do it man."

IIRC, his bag was stolen after day two, and he was the only player in the top 20 who had a worse third round than second round. Understandable given that his third round was with a new set of discs. But he got used to them and then came back on day four and gave Big Jerm a run for his money."
discgolf,3d3bgg,M0b1u5,0,Mon Jul 13 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"I do not think losing his bag cost him any strokes at all.  Paul does not use old beat up discs, and you KNOW that he is getting the A1-tip-top, hand-selected (by him) discs from the factory. Losing his bag (Yes, when you leave your bag in the back of your truck, it's lost, not stolen) simply meant having to build another bag from his backups - which he was all very familiar with.  You have to remember - Paul is a Disc Golf Prodigy! His skill is light years ahead of everyone else. His consistency is stunning.

And I still stand by the fact that he was the only player in the top 20 to have a worse third round than second round. It was an easier course with pretty normal conditions. Even if the discs were the pick of the litter it was almost certainly in his head a bit. I honestly think, if he hadn't had his bag stolen he would have walked away with the W."

I'm not sure I can quantify how insane it was that he kept pace with those guys using an entirely new bag of discs (even if the molds themselves weren't rare, when you're throwing at those distances even a small amount of additional/less wear can amount to a huge amount of turn)."
discgolf,3d3bgg,ORGrown,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:34:48 2015 UTC,Right? It's kind of ridiculous. And you could see the frustration in him through the last two rounds. It definitely cost him a few strokes
discgolf,3d3bgg,M0b1u5,0,Mon Jul 13 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"No.  It wasn't ""an entirely new bag of discs"". These were his well-known backups, thrown in the field, and fully understood by him. That hiccup did not cost him a single stroke.  Plus, Paul is smart enough not to bag old crappy beat-up discs which can't be instantly and perfectly replaced.  This is one of the main reasons why it is stupid to use beat-up discs: if you lose it, you're screwed.  Repeat after me: Beat-up = Worn in = worn out."
discgolf,3d3bgg,arkiverge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:03:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean literally new off the shelf.  I meant something other than what he was used to (tossing here and there to break in does not equal ""well known"" I don't think).  And if you're underscoring how impressive it is to overcome the confidence factor alone of using less-familiar discs (better?) in a tournament of that magnitude then you're just hating on him for reasons I'm unfamiliar with."

discgolf,3d3bgg,disc_addict,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can compare to Tiger's dominance in this case. The fact is that disc golf is still basically in its infancy as a sport. We still only have a handful of touring pros, and in reality there aren't as many competitors in the field that have a realistic chance of beating McBeth. Tiger would win multiple majors against a field of 50+ that had enough talent to win. McBeth has maybe 10 realistic competitors. The level of competition on the PGA tour is staggering. The PDGA just hasn't made it to that level yet. Don't get me wrong McBeth is incredible, I just think it's important to have some perspective. When you look at what's happening in disc golf I think even McBeast himself is going to be surpassed in a few years time. As younger kids start to get involved the talent is going to go through the roof. We're starting to see it now with how the USADGC played out this year. The top 3 were either 16 or under (they might have all 3 been under 16). They're essentially 1000 rated players already, and athletically they haven't even matured yet. I think what I'm trying to say is that you can't really compare Tiger and McBeth, because they're in 2 different eras in their respective sports, but disc golf has an incredibly bright future!"
discgolf,3d3bgg,Grimario,13,Mon Jul 13 19:05:30 2015 UTC,I think medical testing will one and for all prove what some of us have come to suspect... he is an exceptionally well programmed disc golf robot.  I said (and asked) in another thread... is this what it was like when Climo was king? McBeth is so completely dominant that it's almost a given that he will win everything and it's actually exciting when someone else trumps him.
discgolf,3d3bgg,aDramaticPause,8,Mon Jul 13 05:17:59 2015 UTC,I'd say it's even more impressive what McBeth is doing given the depth of competition.
discgolf,3d3bgg,M0b1u5,2,Mon Jul 13 05:42:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. With players like Will, Ricky, and others, there is some stiff competition. Almost every time he wins the second place person is different showing you someone is always having a hot round and on his heels yet he pulls it out almost every time. I love watching it."
discgolf,3d3bgg,zaxmazr,0,Mon Jul 13 12:30:21 2015 UTC,"The competition is only stiff when Paul has a bad day, and the others have a fantastic day.  Ricky, Will, Jerm, Nikko, Feldberg and all the rest are massively talented, but they can't achieve Paul's consistency - not even close.  It's shame really. I am not a fan of Paul's, and would much prefer to see other players win. I always root for the underdog!  Although I am not a fan of his, I am extremely appreciative of the skill he demonstrates, and the level of play he can achieve.  My biggest wish is that he could explain how to do stuff like Dave Feldberg - because frankly, I am a better teacher of disc golf than Paul is."

discgolf,3d4gei,washboard,2,Mon Jul 13 13:52:18 2015 UTC,I've found that Star has some of the biggest variables in terms of feel than a lot of the other plastics. Some star discs have a more slick surface and some are more grippy.
discgolf,3d4gei,saucer_tosser,2,Mon Jul 13 15:04:16 2015 UTC,I've found that when discs start to feel slippery the main two reasons are sweat and oils from my own hands and a dirty or dusty disc. That's why I always bring a hand towel to wipe down the disc and some climber's chalk for my fingers to cut down on the oil and sweat. It helps tremendously here because temps are in the mid-90's and humidity always really high.
discgolf,3d4gei,V0ogurt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:23:30 2015 UTC,"They are pretty slippery, but once they get seasoned they are pretty grippy.

The nice thing about the pro shop is that they will describe what run the disc is from and how that affects the flight (if it is a disc/run where this has happened). They also give you the ability to choose your exact stamp/disc color for discs where specialty stamp colors are offered, like the Paul McBeth P2, Glow C-line MD3, and EO C-line FD3.   They also give you free jolly ranchers in your order =p"

Farther doesn't come from more ""power"", necessarily. It comes from throwing smooth and tight.   Stop doing 360s. Actually, just stop doing a run-up. Do standstill shots, just picking up and planting your front foot. The 360s are probably sapping more power than they are giving to you. Focus on slowing down, pulling through straight and tight, and letting the disc rip out of your hands. Search this sub and Google, you'll find all the answers to your form questions and then some. Get your grip checked out too."

All we're looking at is a disc on the ground next to a basket. No stats on what hole this was, what course it was, how far, what disc it was, or any details at all.

discgolf,3d2scq,rhatton1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:29:19 2015 UTC,"My advice - go out on the field throw putters. Just short throws (about 30 m). Find a grip that's comfortable for you and think about the your body movements and how they relate to the throw. And the most important thing, do a proper follow through.    Fun way to learn body mechanics for forehand is to throw ducks and drakes. (Just take flat rocks and throw them to the river so they skip on the water. It's called ""to throw little frogs"" in Czech, I'm not sure about the English idiom. :D)"
discgolf,3d2scq,caslavak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:28:07 2015 UTC,I was doing this on holiday with backhand technique as well - you can throw huge rocks to skip (like boulder sized things!)with it as long as you get the acceleration nice and late so it doesn't slip early (nigh on impossible to grip) I was amazed by the amount of skips I was getting with some of them. You had to throw almost like an airbounce to really get the skips going but damned good fun!
discgolf,3d2scq,rhatton1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:40:46 2015 UTC,BH? How did you grip the rocks?
discgolf,3d2scq,rhatton1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:48:01 2015 UTC,"not easily,  took a bit of learning for the timing, but just tried to hold on as loosely as possible right until I started feeling them shifting and then tried to clamp down hard and pull them through, got the timing badly wrong on a lot but those I got going were great,  I'm sure there is a good training drill in there for the late acceleration/timing needed for a good backhand, if I used the arm too early there was no way of holding on at the right time. I was on a slate beach  in Wales, so loads of nice flat rocks the biggest I got to skip was about 40 cms diameter (about twice the diameter of a disc), I got one at 20 cmsish to skip over 20 times, went back to do it again next day but the wind had got up and the sea was too messy to skip well, also turns out a headwind would turn the lighter rocks over! So you had to release hyzer!   Honestly I would love to see Simon Lizotte throwing small round stones backhand on a flat lake, I'm sure he could smash the world record of 51 skips"

I posted this comment below, but I'll say it here too: It's a myth that certain discs are ""better for forehand."" Actually, the only thing that matters is how clean your form is. You can forehand (and backhand) putters, mids, drivers, overstable, understable, etc. Certain discs are easier to throw forehand because they cover up the flaws in your technique (e.g. max weight, overstable discs). That doesn't mean they are better for forehand, it means that you need to work on your technique."

discgolf,3d2tmy,Sm0othAsEggs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:31:43 2015 UTC,"Each course in KC has it's own league, and it's own ace fund that pays half; no cap. Usually they get hit somewhere between $250-400, but once or twice a year someone will hit an ace when the fund is something like $600.   Occasionally you'll see the longer courses have their ace funds get upwards of $1000, but it's pretty uncommon."

It will take about a year to beat into straight and will stay there for another year. It will hit and hold that sweet spot the X blazed through.

This new rule is actually pretty simple if you think about it.    What is the target, the objective of the game?  It is to get the disc INTO the basket.  Not on the basket, into the basket.  Not wedged into the side, into the basket.  Not hanging on the side, into the basket.  The chains are inside the basket, so if they are stuck in the chains, the disc is also IN the basket.    I don't actually see the need to needle-point argue any of the potential results.  It is completely clear.    About disc going through the side, that's also a good rule.  The old rule used to allow it, but it had all sorts of problems.  Primarily, it is against the purpose (to throw it INTO the basket).  Secondarily, you had all kinds of other rules, like; did you get there before it fell out? The new rule is much better, and if you play 15 PDGA events a year for 30 years I bet you have to make a rules call on that once.  Since they did away with that rule, and folks moved away from the Gum Putt, it barely happens anymore.  Finally, the point about the wind blowing it away is already irrelevant.  Your lie is the place where the disc comes to rest from its own momentum. But, ask yourself, ""Is the top of the basket IN the basket?"" The answer is, ""No."" and that's why it doesn't count.  In short, this rule is only complicated because people want their shots to count more than they want to apply logic and reason.  You really want the dangler to count, but, ""Is it in?"" Clearly the answer is always, ""No."""
discgolf,3d50q5,SearchingforSilky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"I don't actually see the need to needle-point argue any of the potential results. It is completely clear.   Search this sub for posts about ""is this disc in,"" and the number of results would not follow suit with your statement that it is completely clear/logical/obvious.   You really want the dangler to count, but, ""Is it in?"" Clearly the answer is always, ""No.""   And again, there's no need for this discussion if the answer is always ""yes."" The rule as is leaves a little bit of grey area if a disc is touching the top of the rim but also leaning in towards the inside of the basket. Here's a very rough drawing of what I mean: http://imgur.com/AASsUcd  The second two are out by the current rule, but the first one is arguable. Is it in the basket, even if it's also hanging on the rim? And so on. Isn't it convenient that the photo everyone posts doesn't include an example like my first image? Take a look for yourself: https://i.imgur.com/TrdNcPn.jpg   You may have a clear opinion of my first image, but you ca't deny that people could have valid alternate opinions. Rewording the rule would remove that grey area."
discgolf,3d50q5,SearchingforSilky,3,Mon Jul 13 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between people not knowing the rule, and people needing to undergo serious thought to tell if something conforms.  The number of ""Is it in?"" posts that were simply resolved by informing someone of the rule is exceptional (100%).  In all of those I've seen (and trust me, I've seen a bundle) none of them were even close.  They were all clearly non-conforming.  Also, I've never seen a disc do what that drawing depicts.  I think our physics prevent that from happening.  Second, is it SUPPORTED by the inner wall, chains, or bottom of the tray?  The supporting point is still the rim (which is not the inner wall or bottom) and the disc doesn't count.  You said it best, ""It is touching the top of the rim...""    I can also deny that valid alternate opinions exist, easily.  You would have to demonstrate a disc that is SUPPORTED by the inside wall, chains, or bottom that doesn't count, or vice versa.  And that is a logical impossibility.  That's why this rule works so well.  Just ask yourself, ""Is this being kept off the ground because of its contact with (1) chains, (2) the INSIDE wall of the tray, or (3) the bottom of the tray.  Three ""no"" answers means it doesn't count."

If that was the case, why is the image with all the scenarios so commonly posted? If it was obvious, why would the picture be necessary? The answer is that the rule is not immediately and completely obvious. The picture is necessary for many people to understand the rule. And I think that is the sign of a poorly worded rule.  And as for my example image:   You would have to demonstrate a disc that is SUPPORTED by the inside wall, chains, or bottom that doesn't count, or vice versa. And that is a logical impossibility.   Well think about this: Ultrastars (ultimate discs) are PDGA approved. Do you mean to tell me you can't imagine a scenario where an ultrastar comes to rest touching both the bottom of the inside of the basket AND the top of the rim? Would you then need to decide which point of contact is most responsible? Or is still your interpretation that ""the supporting point is still the rim"" whenever the disc is touching the rim?  I know I am nitpicking here, but this is just one more example of why it would be simpler to say   ""Is it in or on the basket? If yes, you holed out."""

This scenario is covered by the series of three questions posed at the end of the previous post. If the disc is resting partially on the bottom of the basket it is conforming, but if the disc is being supported only by the rim, then it is non-conforming.  Does this rule ever cause problems in competitive play? My sense is that most of the people who pose the question here haven't actually consulted the rule book. I think the rule is quite simple and /u/SearchingforSilky's description is a good one: that the intent of the game (get the disc in the basket) provides all the clarity necessary."
discgolf,3d50q5,M0b1u5,3,Mon Jul 13 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"If the ultra star touches the bottom, then where is it being supported?  Is it being supported by the bottom?  Yes. Then it counts.  Done deal.   Also, I bet most people who are confused, didn't read the rule very carefully, so changing the rule won't fix anything.    What you are saying is the equivalent of a basketball player asking for the bucket to count when it gets stuck next to the rim, or sits on the block behind the hoop.  No, it needs to go through the hoop.  IT MIGHT BE SIMPLER (arguable still), BUT IT ISN'T THE POINT OF THE GAME."
discgolf,3d50q5,OhAbaDis,3,Mon Jul 13 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"What you are saying is the equivalent of a basketball player asking for the bucket to count when it gets stuck next to the rim, or sits on the block behind the hoop. No, it needs to go through the hoop.   That's a good example."
discgolf,3d50q5,OhAbaDis,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"First off, you make it sound like this rule is 100% easy to understand and interpret after people read it.   That's because IT IS easy! If you need more than the actual two sentences which explains the rule, then I am afraid to say that you have a problem with comprehension, and this is no fault of the rules, but a personal failure to comprehend - and making the rule ""easier"" isn't possible.  The rules of disc golf are what I call ""mercifully brief"" and extremely clear. I carry a rule book at all times, and have never ever encountered, in 18 years of playing the National Tour, a situation where the rules did not adequately cover a situation.  On the flip side, I have encountered literally HUNDREDS of players who simply do not know the rules of the game.  In your Ultrastar argument, we first have to say that you're stupid to use one - but after that, the situation is 100% clear: the disc is supported by the bottom of the cage, and so it is in. It doesn't matter that part of the disc is out of the cage, because it is supported by the bottom of the cage.  Disc Golfers abound with ""General Ignorance"" - both of the rules of the game, and about how to throw.   This is predictable, as players start out with Disc Golf as nothing more than a ""pastime"", or an ""activity"". No one keeps score. No gives a shit about the rules. Then perhaps it becomes ""stress relief"" or ""physical therapy"" or maybe ""friendly competition"".  It's at this point the rules start to come into play. And of course, players do not get a rule book, and learn the rules; they absorb the rules by osmosis, as they are informed about them as their game progresses. But they are never fully informed because they did not study the actual rules.  But beyond the ""friendly fun"" stage of Disc Golf the rules are vitally important, and those who understand them best, are best placed to win. So, ALL serious golfers study the rules, and ALL competitive golfers will examine a tournament's rule book and player manual so as to fully understand the variations for a tournament, and where all the OB is.  Failing to do that means you won't win, and more importantly can't win.  If you want to win, it's easy: know the rules, don't break any of them, and use them to your advantage.  The re-throw rule, for example - is an absolute classic. Last NT event, I was second to tee, and the guy before me chucked it into the middle of a gully, and started walking down to it. I chucked one in the same place, and shouted to him to pick my disc up, as I was going to re-tee, as I knew there was no way to recover from the gully without taking at least another two strokes.  The guy was like ""WTF? Dude, you can't do that!""  I'm like ""Learn the rules, dude."" :)"
discgolf,3d50q5,OhAbaDis,5,Tue Jul 14 23:44:24 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it says ""inner cylinder"" so that if a disc hits the outside of the cylinder and wedges in, that wouldn't count.  If the rule just says ""supported only by the basket and/or chains"" then one could argue that a shot that hits the outside of the basket and wedges in should count."

discgolf,3d50q5,The_Warwolf,2,Mon Jul 13 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think that should be counted as a made shot.  Just a different view point I guess.  I think that a shot that hits the outside wall of the cylinder and wedges in never really went into the basket, so I don't think it should count."
discgolf,3d50q5,burritoace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"I think that's a valid point, especially when you word it as ""the disc needs to go in the basket"". I think that with a little word-finagling, you could say ""the disc needs to come to rest supported only by the basket.""  I'm not really thinking about this from a game purity standpoint; more from a ""keep it simple"" standpoint. I like my rules inarguable."
discgolf,3d50q5,DGweekly,4,Mon Jul 13 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"I see what youre saying and your version would be simpler.  But in my opinion, the shot should only count if it goes into the basket, so it has to be worded to reflect that.  Your way would be simpler for sure, but would somewhat change a core aspect."
discgolf,3d50q5,Waex,5,Mon Jul 13 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"supported only by the basket and/or chains   So a disc that hits the outside of the basket and wedged itself into the side without ever being inside the basket would now count as ""supported by the basket"". Changing ""inner cylinder (bottom and inside wall) of the tray"" to ""basket"" makes the rule more ambiguous (with the idea that a disc wedged in from the outside never actually went into the basket and should not count).  The current version ""inner cylinder (bottom and inside wall) of the tray"" is more explicit especially with regards to the wedged in the side issue."
discgolf,3d50q5,deathputt4birdie,3,Mon Jul 13 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"So a disc that hits the outside of the basket and wedged itself into the side without ever being inside the basket would now count as ""supported by the basket""   Not ambiguous, the answer is yes. Anything in or on the basket is in. No ambiguity ever."
discgolf,3d50q5,M0b1u5,2,Mon Jul 13 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"I see what you're going for. I'm definitely of the belief that a disc that first hits the outside of the basket never had a chance to go inside the basket and should not count. I feel like too much is left to chance/luck with your revision.   The current rule as written doesn't seem all that complex and promotes skill instead of luck. It's unlikely you'll get the disc inside the bottom of the cylinder or held by the chains without some sort skillful intention.  EDIT: If you're just playing with your friends I'd use whatever rules you all agree to use. If you're playing a tourney, well we're all stuck with whatever are the current PDGA rules."

I could rip on it as hard as I wanted and I knew it'd come down to the left safely. My PD is starting to get somewhat broken in even though it's a C-Line and it's definitely more straight, but still can be thrown into a headwind fine for me."
discgolf,3d218h,M0b1u5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:57:56 2015 UTC,I throw both PD's and a Firebird. I use the PD's on open distance and the firebird for shorter hard turns in the woods and utility shots like extreme spike hyzers over trees. The PD's have a nice gradual fade to their line whereas the firebird just dumps super hard left/right when it slows down even a little bit.  If you like your PD I would recommend bagging a P-line version as well. I found one that was slightly beat in one and it is becoming my all time favorite driver.

You probably won't need to set up a tournament or anything, regardless of how you do it, unless you're going to have a custom stamp.

discgolf,3d04at,Westin2022,6,Thu Jul 16 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of scenarios where it will matter and a lot of it will have to do with how you want the disc to land. Let's look at a few scenarios  Basket is perched at the the bottom of a hillside. Hillside is to right, OB creek is left.   I'd throw a forehand here, so it hits the hillside and stops, maybe bounces toward the basket a bit, but almost definitely not going to catch an edge and roll into the OB creeek.    Basket on at the top of a steep dropoff, landing zone short, but past the basket is a steep hill and/or trouble   Here I probably throw a turnover intending on it flatten out and land just a bit short. What will happen is even if I throw it long, if it's hyzering into the hill, it's likely to hit the hill and stick. Where a forehand may get a big skip and fly off down the hill   Wind (For RH players)    Headwind and you've got the option, probably throw the FH shot, it's less like to turn into a roller. In a headwind situation your turnover shot could cut roll and end up god knows where. With a crosswind, Left to right is going to make the forehand skip more, or the turnover glide out more, and a right to left crosswind will stable out the turnover quicker, so you'll need to weigh what you want the disc to be doing.   Hope this makes sense!"
discgolf,3d04at,jacetheace517,2,Sun Jul 12 13:54:31 2015 UTC,"Great points. I would add the the turn over line and forehand line are differnt shapes as well, which can be important depending on the line you'd like to hit."
discgolf,3d04at,Drunkindoughnuts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"Great point. For me anyway, if there's a low ceiling, I'm more likely to throw the forehand, because you can get the left to right finish with less space. I'm not overly great at low turnover shots as they tend to cut roll really easily. I know some of the better players can do it, but I'm not one of them. My turnovers need height to be effective."
discgolf,3d04at,jacetheace517,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:49:12 2015 UTC,"Also depends on the play you want after contact, forehand will likely skip up and finish harder right, where a turnover you won't get the same skip, and end straighter, with a much higher chance of a cutback roll. I know you gave some examples to cover that aspect but it wasn't broken down on a basic level."
discgolf,3d04at,SaintVaIentine,2,Sun Jul 12 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"To tl;dr the longer posts, it really comes down to how sharp of an angle coming down you want (the sharper you want the more you'll lean towards forehand) and also the angle of the slope you're landing on. If it's angled downhill in the direction of the flight, you'll get a HUGE skip if thrown forehand."
discgolf,3d04at,NathanHammerTime,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"I think, as others have said, that t all comes down to control. McBeth only flicks his Krait, and his destroyers are all for backhand. Check out his most recent in the bag he talks about his shot choices a bit and the discs for the shot type."
discgolf,3d04at,doubleak47,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"why?  you can use a more stable ( ie. more consistent) disc.  it will generally fare better in windy conditions.  i like throwing FH for some left to right shots in the woods because you can throw harder with confidence, because you don't have to turn your head away from the target to gain power (the way you do with BH).    For me , FH drives are normally just short if I don't throw them 'perfect'.  With BH, if it turns too much, it will cut roll and go the opposite direction.  If it stables out, it fades in the opposite direction you need it to go.  FH can also take some obstacles and OB completely out of play."
discgolf,3d04at,idrivetherapevan,0,Mon Jul 13 06:27:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you are trying to achieve.  A forehand can skip further right when it lands, but a Backhand never will. A BH will land flat (and stop) or cut roll to the right (bad).  It is much harder to control the landing on a turnover shot, than a forehand - and Forehands CAN have the freaky ability to be incredibly accurate without really trying.  Wind is a big factor, as is altitude, and distance - and each player decides what the best shot to throw is, based on these factors, and their skill level with each type of shot, and disc chosen."

discgolf,3cytwz,Punk_Zebraa,14,Sun Jul 12 00:45:42 2015 UTC,"(1) BEST FORM POST EVER!    Wow, this is the template for how a form post should look.  You include everything I could ever want, kudos.  Anyone out there looking to get a form critique should pay attention.  Identify the skill you want to improve. Add tons of background and context. Give a few angles, and include both slo-mo and full speed.  (2) Grip's gotta change.  First thing is to move the index finger. You want the crease of your first knuckle (closest to tip) on the bead or bottom of the wing (where it would touch if you put it on a table).  This will help release, and provide a good mechanism to control height (it helps keep the nose up on release).  Edit: Below they pointed out that some pretty talented guys seem to have their fingers on the edge.  I think it is clearly viable to do it that way, so I'd like to revise my statement a bit.  The important thing is to be under the wing a bit, where at least the tip of your finger seems to reach south pull up a bit.  Just pull the wing up when you release, that's all, however you can do it.  As a second point with grip, the other fingers look okay.  They appear a bit ""tight"".  Relax a bit, and get more contact with the disc on the pads of your fingers. Also, I can't see your thumb, but it should be about 1.25-1.5"" from the edge, and should interact (kinda) with your middle finger.  (3) Gotta spin the disc.    I spin my putter everywhere.  I practice this skill all the time.  Just work on tossing the disc up, with good spin, and with control.  You can do it while you watch TV, walking around, waiting on teeboxes (if you toss it low you can do it during PDGA events without a penalty), etc.  Up. Down. Up. Down. Predictable.  Tight spins.  Predictable. Aim-able. Predictable. Up. Down.  (4) Pendulum.  You do what I call ""picking up"" the putter.  Its a blend of the ""push"" (I hate this designation) and ""spin"" putts.  I think this makes putting hard.  The most common style is the former, and that's what I will recommend.  You need to start with your hand a tiny bit lower (watch McBeth, he touches his mid thigh with the putter before he putts).  And you need to maintain the long, arcing, pendulum motion all the way through.  Don't lift up and snap anything.  Just stay long and smooth. It'll take time, but when you figure it out, its easy, I promise. Think about tossing a ball to someone close to you.  Its that simple.  (5) Swing to the ""Hit.""  Just like in the regular throw, there is a ""hit"" in putting.  Its the moment that you get fully extended, your weight shifts, your elbow straightens, and your wrist spins the putter.  That ""spinning"" from (3) is crucial to making this work. You need to practice that until it becomes instinctual.  Where you just naturally spin the disc every time you toss it. Because the secret is to put that ""spin"" at the end of that gentle underhand toss.  If you have to think about both spinning and swinging, you're fucked.  (6) Posture is powerful.  You are a bit too far leaned over.  You have the right idea, leaning over, but you are a bit over extended.  You want your center mass just over or a little forward of your front foot.  Any more than that and you don't leave much to weight transfer.  (7) Weight transfer is hard.  This is the hardest part of putting.  My hint here is that you only need to shift it forward.  I think many players feel like they have to shift back, then shift forward.  You don't.  Maybe a tiny rock on your back foot, but not much. The trick is to give the push at the ""hit"" (see above).  As you reach the end of your pendulum, a little pop of the foot from the back leg should do the trick. The weight transfer is 50% lower body, 50% upper body.  It's just as much the pop of the back leg as it is fully reaching out with your torso.  (8) Commit.  Commit.  Commit.  You do a decent job of this, so this is sort of just for noticing, encouraging, and reminding.  It is so important to reach out and extend to your target.  I think this is one thing most middle of the road golfers don't do.  Pick a point to aim at, and then reach for it. If you do this right the weight transfer will be way easier.  (9) Make it something easy.  Imagine you were playing catch using a slow-pitch softball with your six year old niece.  You cant throw it fast, cause she won't catch it.  You can't throw it low, because she won't catch it.  You have to just calmly toss it to her center mass.  Its easy.  You are just tossing a ball.    (10) Enjoy putting.  This is mostly psychological, but the mental basket is the hardest one to hit.  Smile when you approach a putt.  Smile when you line it up.  Just smile every time you think about putting.  Chuckle when you practice, and tell yourself how much fun your having.  Even if you aren't.  The positive attitude will eventually build connections in your brain, and one day you might actually love putting.  Either way, its frustrating and you'll either laugh, or cry.  Laughing is more fun.  (11) Practice from twenty feet and CLOSER!  Practice from close.  Build confidence.  Smile.  Don't practice missing.  Don't ""putt till you find your bad zone."" Putt and make them...  Aim small, and don't accept a made putt.  Only be satisfied when you hit the tiny thing you were aiming at.  For example, when I practice I putt at a basket with a single wrap of electrical tape.  If I hit the tape, I get a point; miss the tape and I don't.  I often make putts and don't get points.    Hope something in there helps.  Let me know if I can answer any questions, clarify, generally improve, or do a follow up.    Cheers!"
discgolf,3cytwz,SearchingforSilky,8,Sun Jul 12 02:04:49 2015 UTC,Wow this is amazing. Thank you so much. I'll play with these tomorrow and get back to you on an follow up questions I will have. Because I know I will have some hahahah
discgolf,3cytwz,Cirqued,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:35:16 2015 UTC,Those are some nice tips above. However putting is very individual. I don't think I've seen to people putt exactly the same. I think you should put enough practice time in to figure out the mechanics that work for you. Also I think Steve Rico would disagree on the wobble. http://youtu.be/rEfjeUvy_ic
discgolf,3cytwz,Cirqued,2,Mon Jul 13 01:12:49 2015 UTC,"My only problem with the wobble is I can't make putts outside like 15 feet consistently because it wobbles so much and I always miss short or I force it too much and it doesn't throw straight and i miss to the sides. I would like to be able to hit ever putt at 20 feet at least, and slowly extend that to 30. If i can make 30 feets and in consistently I will save myself so many strokes."
discgolf,3cytwz,Cirqued,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"Watch that video of Rico. The first thing he talks about is the importance of using the legs, what Silky talks about in his 7. Like all form concepts in disc golf the ""legs drive the arm"" in putting as well. You should not be ""forcing"" putts. What is your putting style?"
discgolf,3cytwz,nofxorbust,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what you mean by putting style, I've only been doing this for a week. I think it would be called a push putt? I don't spin the disk I just let it go, I think thats a push"
discgolf,3cytwz,OriginalKopy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"I use the same style. I've seen it called push, pitch, or shovel putt. Watch the first part of this Feldberg clinic for the basics http://youtu.be/-wrjOOzXQ1Y this Philo clinic is nice as well http://youtu.be/W6pdd-ETeos"
discgolf,3cytwz,contronomator,4,Mon Jul 13 04:07:04 2015 UTC,"I see nothing wrong with the grip because that's how I grip my putters. I consistently hit metal from 40. Grip to me is whatever feels comfortable, just keep working at it. Everything else I see here is solid advice though.  *Edit: when I practice it's only 10m and in."
discgolf,3cytwz,SearchingforSilky,3,Sun Jul 12 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like OPs grip either, I used to have a putting grip like that and my consistency just felt off. I ended up realizing you need that first knuckle crease under the bead/lip of the disc to have stability. Been feeling much more confident with my putts and the stability shows from there not being nearly as much wobble as before. To each his own but I agree with the suggestion above if that counts for anything."
discgolf,3cytwz,Mac__,3,Sun Jul 12 04:09:51 2015 UTC,Looks like Mcbeth's putting grip is similar to OP's as well.  I think Wysocki also lays his index finger on the side of the disc as opposed to bead in the crease of the knuckle.
discgolf,3cytwz,OSU09,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that recently.  It looks like both of those guys tighten their grip a bit, and get a bit below the wing right at the moment of putting, sometimes. On closer inspection, it does seem that the tips of their fingers are below the side, and on the bevel, even if they aren't bead-in-crease.  Maybe the important thing is to have some point of contact lifting up from the front, and making sure the disc releases above your index finger.  Well pointed out."
discgolf,3cytwz,CopiousAmountsOf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:15:04 2015 UTC,"The first point here ""Grips gotta change"" is the exact key that helped my putting go from mediocre to good.  Almost overnight.  Put your index finger's first joint on the bead of the putter.  If you don't have a bead, put it on the rim.    A second point, after watching your video is don't drop the nose of the disc down ever.  Keep that nose up.  So, while you're doing the pendulum thing keeeeeeeeeep it upppppp!"

If I start in the right spot with my weight and make sure my bank leg pops up, it works.  The first few times my weight shifted properly, I putted way past the basket because of how much more power I had."

discgolf,3cytwz,CasualGamerDad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party.  I agree with searchingforsilky about some, but please don't think you need to change your grip.  That is not causing the wobble.  To create less wobble, in your practice back swing(and in your real back swing) try to bring it closer to your ankles.  I'm not meaning inches from the ground, but notice the line in which your release.  Draw an imaginary straight line on that line going behind you.  That should be your back swing line.  Just like driving, putters need a consistent line as well. Also, don't be afraid to put a bit of hyzer on the disc.  You can lead the disc with the back of your hand, and just smoothly open your hand in the follow through.  That's helped my game a lot.  On the longer putts, you can give less hyzer which will allow more distance."
discgolf,3cytwz,Ironbeak1,2,Tue Jul 14 16:07:06 2015 UTC,"What about straddle putting? In a round today I had to do a straddle to get around a tree and I nailed the putt perfectly. I started staddling the rest of the round and I was making more putts than when I did what I was doing. The straddle putt was forcing me to bring the disc low and my wobble wasn't there anymore, if only a little.  Is there any advantages to straddle putting or disadvantages?"
discgolf,3cytwz,Jub11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"I use both.  It's great to practice both because you will need all types of putting styles down the road...you never know where your lie will be.  Straddle putting is what I started out with and it worked well for me.  But for me, I found there was only so much distance I could get with it, and that's why I've taken a more traditional style. There are different advantages to the two styles, but it's mainly due to obstacles being in the way."

discgolf,3d2wu2,itsmrpenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:46 2015 UTC,"I'd advise not throwing for aces with a nuke honestly.  It is very risky to throw right at baskets with long drivers.  However, with that being said I've witnessed around 10 aces and they have almost all been slight hyzers at the end.  It sounds like your shot you threw is a good line for it."
discgolf,3d2wu2,germywormy,2,Mon Jul 13 02:55:53 2015 UTC,I didn't even know people intentionally tried for aces. I remember a discussion on here once about going for birds and getting accidental aces being the way to go. My only ace I was using a driver trying to skip it close to the basket and it just happened to skip in... Was very lucky.

discgolf,3cywn7,xxgtfoxx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:12:40 2015 UTC,The definitions of these things in relation to Disc Golf would seem to get gray.  What  exactly would be..  Making a Green in Regulation? Inside the circle? Plus many holes are simply put three.  GIR should happen near everytime on tour.   Our fairways can be tightly wooded and everything else. Except on ball golf courses would there be an actual fairway.  I too enjoy the idea but they would just have to relate better.
discgolf,3cywn7,gruss22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that the categories would have to be more specific to disc golf, but thats a given. It's really cool to see data like this that compares a players performance in the past year to the current tournament they are playing. Idk what specific stats there would be like % putts inside the circle/average putts per round or whatever, but who knows what the future holds for disc golf courses. Maybe discgolf will get big enough to require more manicured fairways, greens, and OB's for the pro tour!"

Don't keep score.  Give them a little talk about form, but don't force it on them. Ask before you give unsolicited advice."

discgolf,3cz6ov,disc_addict,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, I like keeping score with newbs because that way they realize how quickly they get better. I always keep score but emphasize that they're not playing against me or anyone, just against themselves. ""look when we started the round you carded a 7 or 8 on every hole, now you're down to 4 or 5, that's awesome!""  I usually just explain a few basics (grip firm, pull like a lawnmower, keep the nose down) and then let them play around with it. Once they get more comfortable, I gradually give more hints, but always ask first if they want more.  Sometimes it helps to point out what went wrong in a throw (or what they did right if it flew particularly nice) to help them understand the game."
discgolf,3cz6ov,randomt2000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:22:06 2015 UTC,I'd keep score on each individual hole.  I wouldn't announce my scores.  It can be motivating to keep track of your own score if you're a beginner and you find yourself doing well.
discgolf,3cz6ov,righteousmoss,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:44:13 2015 UTC,Are you the type of kid that enjoyed a pop quiz on the first day of the school year?
discgolf,3cz6ov,CrayonAccident,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, but as a novice it is much more motivating to see yourself make a nice throw or an epic putt when you don't know that you've got no shot at par for the hole.  You can just enjoy each throw for what it is. it's the same reason you let kids beat you at a board game the first couple times.  They get to see how the game works, maybe think a bit about a strategy (or technique), and enjoy the thrill of accomplishment when it works out. Scoring a beginner just adds to the list of things that they can go on tilt about.    Unless someone in the group is very competitive and really enjoys that aspect of the game.  Then maybe just score yours and theirs, and still leave the option for the weaker players to play best lay.  FWIW, I think that just adds stress on the group dynamic, and you should probably encourage M. Competitive-pants to score themselves in their head and keep quiet about it until the round is over."
discgolf,3cz6ov,rocketwrench,3,Sun Jul 12 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to have them practice some throws before you start playing the actual course. Find an open space at the course and have them also see you do a couple of throws. Show them some basic tips like proper stance, grip, etc. Explain some rules, the different types of discs, their uses and their flight patterns.  Even just a few minutes of practice beforehand could be the difference between fun and frustration."

discgolf,3cz6ov,Muffalowingz,2,Mon Jul 13 02:09:08 2015 UTC,"Don't throw anything faster than a speed 8, understable is better for beginners, form over power, don't be mad about high scores you'll get a lot of snowmen, practice practice practice, play with better players, forget brand loyalty. I'll add more if I think of anything."
discgolf,3cz6ov,nofxorbust,2,Sun Jul 12 03:13:32 2015 UTC,Just give them both an older putter and a straight flying mid and teach them both an appropriate power grip so they can have a bit easier of a time getting some power behind their shots and I recommend playing a game like wolf (if you don't know the rules it's basically a version of doubles and skins mixed together and is a lot better for teaching beginners than playing actual doubles the rules are in a thread on this sub somewhere I'm sure) and make sure to be super supportive and help them have a great time! Giving them a driver no matter how under stable will probably result in a frustrating time but a mid and a putter should hopefully help them have a couple of shots they remember as being pretty good!
discgolf,3cz6ov,jacobmuellerr,2,Sun Jul 12 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"Explain the scoring, tell them they should feel good if as a beginner they get a bogey on a hole.  This gives new folks something to try for and then they feel awesome if they get a legit par.  Have them try both forehand and backhand throws and go with whatever goes further.  Bring some beer."
discgolf,3cz6ov,righteousmoss,2,Sun Jul 12 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"I would suggest giving them a very basic talk on form to have them not start with bad habits. The most important thing being to avoid rounding, followed by using you hips to generate power, using that momentum to elbow someone next to them, and then opening their shoulders to generate snap. The disc goes on a straight line and smoothness will get them further than strong-arming it. Then show them how you can throw 200 feet easily with a very smooth and slow throw so they will believe you.  Other than that let them throw how they want and don't over-coach them. Complement good throws with good form, even tell them why that throw worked better. If they manage to turn over a midrange or putter with a good throw then give them something with more speed or more overstable and tell them to throw the exact same way again so they don't think they did anything wrong.  Most importantly have fun. If they want help they can ask and if you give them a talk at the start they will know you be able to help them."

discgolf,3czfb1,jacetheace517,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:48:07 2015 UTC,"The player ratings are generally the minimums, so as others have said if you don't have a rating, you can technically play whatever division you want. Advanced has a rating guideline of 935+, and specifically if you are 935+ you CANNOT play anything lower than Advanced.  That being said, it sounds like you should be playing advanced depending on your area. If you play with your local club at all or doubles leagues or anything like that you can check with some people you feel competitive with and see what they play.   I've found that some areas tend to breed different types of players. In Charleston, the ability to throw over 350 ft isn't important because most of courses tend to have tight fairways or challenging greens, versus big open holes. Other areas you'll have 500ft par 3s everywhere, and to compete there you need 400+ ft.   My point in saying that is that in my area 350-420 and a solid putter will generally put you in competition for Advanced. I'm a top 50% intermediate player in my area and my top end distance is about 300, but my putting is like 90% from 20 ft and in, and 50 percent from 25-30 ft, so I get outdriven pretty often, but make up for it with controlled upshots and putting. But in Advanced, they'll be getting that extra 50 ft, so a 380 ft hole becames a birdie op for them, but for me it's a prayer at a 80-90 ft putt/throw in. But I have been to areas where every player in intermediate (except me) was throwing almost 400 ft because that's what the course demanded. They had very little control over it, so they tended to struggle on the tight holes, but they would make up 1-2 strokes per hole on the big open ones."

Same friends said you need to play a tournament, hopefully playing this tournament I can make some more friends who are better then me so I can keep improving my game. Tournament is 2 rounds each round is at a different course, all par 3's a good amount are 400ft+. I know on pdga website a pro 1000 rated player signed up for the tournament I'm definitely excited to see if I can keep up with him and learn a few things."

'Basket Targets: In order to hole out, the thrower must release the disc and it must come to rest supported by the chains and/or the inner cylinder (bottom and inside wall) of the tray.'

I mean, really, all these ways that technically don't count are significantly harder to do than the ways that do.  How many times would you have to throw a disc to get it to balance on the edge like that, or stay on the very top of the target, or wedged in the side of the basket? It would probably take 50 throws to do something like that for every one throw that went in a ""legal"" way. Why would they not count?

discgolf,3cyzqw,runfasterd00d,2,Sun Jul 12 01:44:13 2015 UTC,"Because of different plastics (even within the same ""blend""), there is disc inconsistency. Star from 2000 is not the same as star from 2005, or 2015. On top of that different runs have different PLH. Parting-line-height.. essentially the higher the height of the PLH the more stable the disc is. So if you buy a sidewinder and that run of sidewinders had higher PLH, those discs in that run typically are more stable. Despite being the same ""exact"" plastic blend and same ""exact"" mold.   Personally I think it's not a good thing at all. However, take destroyers for example. People love them and there are so many different runs that produce different variations of the same mold to the point where there are people who love the destroyers that have patent numbers on the back with preflight numbers. Maybe they like the newer flat and crazy overstable run of destroyer. If you know the run you have and love, you can turn around and stock up on destroyers from the same time period/and or run. Now you know that you bought a disc that most likely fits the same EXACT plastic blend and PLH. This is something people DO like about disc inconsistency. Now you have the ""same"" disc in the same plastic and mold.. but add in the monkey wrench of other plastics in the same mold and it becomes a circus of various possibilities. It would be amazing if they were able to perfect the molding process to produce the same disc every single time."

But it's old and really beat and it's getting to be too understable so I don't even bag it anymore honestly. I thought about getting one in champ but who knows if it's gonna fly like that. I mean, it's kind of frustrating because I'm not the person who is going to pay 30 bucks for a pfn disc. I just  don't think it's worth it when I'm not a big tourney player or something. But I have no idea what disc to get to throw a nice hyzer flip. I mean, are other manufacturers more accurate than innova with their numbers? It just seems like a crap shoot as to whether or not they are going to fly like expected."
discgolf,3cyzqw,CSHustle,2,Sun Jul 12 02:09:40 2015 UTC,"All manufactures have their inconsistencies. In my personal opinion, I feel MVP Discraft and Lat64 have the most consistency. I throw Innova only except for putters (wiz) and stuff is wildly inconsistent. But if everyone has inconsistency, that's when it's good to have indicators such as PFN, patent numbers, 10x, 11x, etc. Then you have the ability to track down what you like better. Not all pfn discs are 30$, you can find them cheap on facebook depending on what disc/run you want.   When a disc beats in; the edge and wing bend downward. That creates the disc to become more understable. That's why when you have baseline plastic like DX or pro which beats in quicker, you have a disc that becomes flippier faster. My favorite plastic is star for most discs other than mids and putters. For drivers atleast it beats in nice and slow which can suck, but once it hits that sweet spot you love, it sticks there for a LONG time! My advice would be to find a disc that matches what you would want in terms of flight ratings, and then buy it in a premium plastic. Hope that it is relatively close to the ratings off the shelf and then just beat it in nice and slow and have it last virtually forever."
discgolf,3cyzqw,rocketwrench,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"Champ plastic tends to be more stable than star or pro.  And if the disc if your sidewinder is heavier than your cheetah, you may just not have enough armspeed yet to get this particular one to flip.  You can try taking the flashing off of the bottom of the disc with an emry board or some 220 sandpaper."
discgolf,3cyzqw,rocketwrench,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I think I am just going to keep throwing the sidewinder and beating it in naturally. In the mean time though, what is a good disc for nice hyzer flip lines? Im looking right now between a valkyrie, a lat 64 jade and a MVP amp. Any experience with these? Ive had 2 valks but they were beat dx and too flippy. I had a champ valk but lost it before I was any good."

discgolf,3cyzqw,CSHustle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:23:58 2015 UTC,"Get a light weight Teebird. I throw almost no Innova at all anymore, but this disc remains a staple. If I throw it 70%-85% power it flips up to straight and goes a long ways, and if I throw it 85%+ it will flip up and over for a beautiful turnover to anhyzer type line. I have a 150g Star Teebird (not StarLite, 150 gram Star) that I don't know if I can replace if I lose it."
discgolf,3cyzqw,disc_addict,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:31:21 2015 UTC,Flat Lat64 River. If you can throw 350 you should be able to hyzer flip an FD. Grab one in star in 170ish weight and watch it become your favorite fairway. A touch more stable is my new favorite fairway; the Rival by Legacy. Basically a perfectly beat in teebird off the shelf.
discgolf,3cyzqw,disc_addict,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:32:16 2015 UTC,I'm going to recommend a Westside Hatchet. It should flip right out of the box. Tournament plastic for slightly more understable.

This one round he was incredibly stoned, beyond belief. It was really windy too. On a 350ft open hole, for some reason, he pulls out a Star Katana and proceeds to grip lock the fuck out of it. It's probably 150ft in the air, 100 ft right, and then spikes into the basket without hitting chains. The funniest thing happened after that. We were all cheering and my buddy couldn't stop smiling (very very baked). 3 seconds after the ace we hear a voice from a PA system say ""Betcha can't do that again""..It was a cop parked 50 yards behind us just watching people in the park.

Once I started playing school sports, I stopped playing dg. Last September, after nearly a decade of not playing, I went back to Michigan and played at my old course, Chippewa Banks in Midland. On the Fifth hole, my dad threw a BEAUTIFUL shot that landed 8-10ft from the pin. I stepped up and shot my Xpress through the trees and aced it. We both went nuts, only to be called a bastard by my own father shortly after.  I threw that Xpress in the water 3 weeks later, at La Mirada in CA :("

My dad used to be big into this when he was younger, but my mom had never been. My dad took her to go with a few friends (they wern't married at the time) and my mom said that she was sucking so bad, kept throwing them in the woods, stuff like that. This was her first time, but somehow she said she just threw it and it took a lucky bounce off of a tree and she aced it hahaha, I went to the course yesterday and I couldn't figure out which one she did ace. She said she would go back and try to figure out which one it was. It had to be at least 200 ft I think, I can't recall any holes that were under 200 but I could be wrong. I'll see once she goes back and sees, she doesn't remember the hole anymore but she said she would recognize it. This was at McNaughton Park in Pekin, IL"

I was annoyed and having a shitty round so I just picked up my Boss and threw it forehand, no line up, no aiming just tossed it out there. It flew just outside the same tree I hit before hand, came back left before its natural fade took over and bombed right into the basket. Couldn't believe it. I just didnt even try and nailed my first ace out of frustration. Now my friend loves pointing out that ot dodn't even count because ot was my second tee shot just to mess with me lol"

I've gotten plenty of chains/metal hits on the local pitch-in-putt course, but no glory.  Last week, I was out at another mid-range course (200-365' avg) and had the park all to myself. I decided to try out some different grips and thumb placements, which led to some really, really bad late-release throws.   Hole #7 is 365' and wide open, I flub the release and watch as my disc sails slowly, majestically into the basket on #5 - about 300' away and at least 45 degrees to the right of the proper basket. I looked around to see if there was anyone else around, did a little cheer for myself, and then continued to throw badly for the rest of the round.   Own it. Celebrate it.

Both had wide shots going to land about 10 feet away from the basket.

discgolf,3ctktg,junkyard22,2,Sat Jul 11 01:57:13 2015 UTC,I had a tee bird and I maxed out at the same. Like there is a hole at my local course that is uphill 285. I have thrown both tee it's and thunderbird 10 feet from the basket
discgolf,3ctktg,slideyaboard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:59:41 2015 UTC,Uphill is a lot different then flat land. The best advice that you can use is start with a putter and a mid-range and play with just those. You should be able to score well with just those and then move up to drivers.
discgolf,3ctktg,junkyard22,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"Try something more understable. If you like the feel of the thunderbird look into a viking, Valkyrie, sidewinder, or roadrunner."

It sounds funny but it can make you throw a lot better because you are focusing more on technique instead of trying to throw as hard as you can. Try throwing at like 50 percent power, then just keep upping it 5 percent or so at a time, focusing on good technique, until you find a sweet spot. Mine is usually at like 80-90 percent power but it all depends on the day for me."

discgolf,3ctktg,im_a_grill_btw_AMA,0,Sat Jul 11 20:39:52 2015 UTC,The argument was whether it was an ace or not. Doesn't matter if he was in a competition to get an ace. Are you going to discredit my six aces because I only got them during casual rounds?
discgolf,3ctktg,xderek182,0,Sat Jul 11 23:51:08 2015 UTC,"Simons shot isn't from a teepad, its from grass during a distance comp. He isn't playing a hole, so it can't be an ace. Imagine walking up 50 ft from a basket, throwing it in, and saying you got a 50 ft ace. Because it's from far away its an ace? So. Dumb."
discgolf,3ctktg,SnipSnappp,2,Sun Jul 12 01:01:52 2015 UTC,Not all courses have tee pads. This is clearly an area marked for taking tee shots from so it's an ace. Even if he took 10 shots it's an ace.

The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and therefore remain visible.  Subtractive color systems start with light, presumably white light. Colored inks, paints, or filters between the viewer and the light source or reflective surface subtract wavelengths from the light, giving it color. If the incident light is other than white, our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well, but not perfectly, often giving a flawed impression of the ""true"" color of the surface.  Conversely, additive color systems start with darkness. Light sources of various wavelengths are added in various proportions to produce a range of colors. Usually, three primary colors are combined to stimulate humans’ trichromatic color vision, sensed by the three types of cone cells in the eye, giving an apparently full range.

Some of the course was wooded, other areas were wide open fields. No water hazards, but plenty of places to shank it into the woods (almost lost a driver). It's a good course to introduce people to the sport (my dad and sister are hooked now) with a lot of short holes at the beginning that gradually get more difficult."

discgolf,3cvifh,ProfDrCmdrChang,3,Sat Jul 11 03:05:41 2015 UTC,"Don't walk sideways on the teepad.  Start facing the direction of the line of play, and let your X-Step turn your body away from the LoP.  Don't pull hard at the start of the pull-through. Slow it down until it gets to your right pec, and THEN pound the hammer really hard."
discgolf,3cvifh,M0b1u5,2,Sat Jul 11 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"You throw a little further than me and seem to have better form than I do, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  I think your timing for shifting your weight from your legs and when you pull through is a little off so I don't think you're getting the power from your legs. I have been having an incredibly hard time with fixing this myself so I can't really offer much.  The other obvious thing I saw is that your plant foot is supposed to have the weight on your heel so when you turn your foot the weight is on the heel and the front of your foot turns to the target. I saw yours was the opposite which'll probably slow down some force.  Can't offer much but I figured I'd give you something! Maybe some other people who have better form + throw farther could either agree or be more specific. Gl."
discgolf,3cvifh,aDramaticPause,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"Timing has been a big issue for me, and even bigger when I stopped playing regularly. It's frustrating because, in my head, I know the building blocks of good form, like planting with the heel for instance. It's just getting a good rhythm and not feeling like I'm forcing all of those elements to happen. It gets into my head more often than I'd like."
discgolf,3cvifh,fyjimo8103,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:40:30 2015 UTC,"As per the title, I've been playing for about three years now. I'd say my skill level is probably somewhere in the ""lower"" intermediate range.  I made a lot of progress last year (thanks to lurking on this sub and some great people on Instagram), but about three months ago I injured my wrist and I haven't been the same since.  I'd love to start getting more consistency and improving my accuracy and positioning. I'm not all about distance, but throwing farther wouldn't exactly be unwelcome because I've plateaued in that aspect as well.   OAT is a huge problem for me. It's not evident in the video but due to my wrist injury I've been seeing a lot more of it in my throws. If it wasn't for the magic of slow motion video I don't think I'd ever have notice how shaky my wrist gets during the run-up and reach-back. I've been trying to slow myself down but I have a hard time controlling that. From watching the video I'm moving a lot faster than I thought I was.  My average throw is in the 350'-370' range with fairway drivers. Distance drivers don't go much further than that for me. My longest throw was a little over 390'.   EDIT: Here's a video I found that I took on June 7. I don't know if the angle's better for you guys. It's on a teepad this time. https://youtu.be/YaF67qTj78U"
discgolf,3cvifh,WhitakerWilbur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"Just loosen up a little. Great form and solid release lines. I feel like you're concetrating so much on form that you end up a little stiff/rigid. Now it is in your muscle memory (after 3 years).  Loosen up, be fluid, and think about literally nothing when you throw. Be lighter on your feet like Mohamed Ali."
discgolf,3cvifh,WhiteMike32,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:37:54 2015 UTC,"First time commenting on a critique!  I've always ignored these mostly because there's usually a million comments on them and I persoanlly don't like overload people with info when learning how to throw.  But since there are so few responses... First off, it's not that bad.  Seemingly, you have everything needed for more distance (with accuracy).    X-step, reach back, head angle and rotation, all look pretty good.  I agree with aDramaticPause that your timing is certainly off though.  And with an injured wrist, it may take more time to heal and develop improvement.  But from what I see, you need to work on your run up, timing, explosion, grip, and follow through.  That's a lot right there.   So pick one or two to focus on, go out to a field, and figure it out.  Then add to what you have learned over time.  With your run up,  You need to begin facing your target. It's much easier to visualize your line this way.   It also can add energy when going into your x step.   As far as timing, watch some top pro videos of their drives.  It's a particular rhythm that your trying to hit, and when you do, you'll know it.  Grip is huge, and this may be hard with an injured wrist.  But letting the disc literally rip out of your hand without you opening and letting go of it is KEY to major distance.  Tork is what it's all about.  Your follow through also needs way more finish.  Explode through your drive, let the disc rip out, keep your arm on the original flight line all the way through, and let your arm whip around your body To finish.  Your left leg, (which by the looks of it is already starting to do) will follow through to the end with out you even really knowing it.  (Look at Will Schustericks drives).  I've played this game for quite some time and have recently jumped up a level in distance (finally) with consistency.  Grip was the most recent thing that I have been focussing on.  I can now throw 450-500 with consistency.  Ive even hit 550 on grip lock because my grip is so tight.  Eventually, and with practice, learning how to control your newfound tork will be at the top of the list for improvement.  Which would be awesome!  Hope this helped."

As far as timing, watch some top pro videos of their drives. It's a particular rhythm that your trying to hit, and when you do, you'll know it.   That's what I definitely feel I've had so much trouble with since I started taking this more seriously a couple of years ago. I can never seem to get the timing down. I know the building blocks of it in my head, but it's finding the rhythm of it that gets so frustrating for me. It's actually what I was specifically trying to work on yesterday when I made the video.   Grip is huge, and this may be hard with an injured wrist. But letting the disc literally rip out of your hand without you opening and letting go of it is KEY to major distance. Tork is what it's all about.   This was definitely something I noticed after I sprained my wrist. Up until then I got a pretty good handle on it but now I can't seem to find a grip that feels as natural as it used to. /u/rhatton1 mentioned my grip as well. I'll post a picture when I get out on the course.  Thanks for the great tips. This is the frustrating part for me because I absorb information pretty well, and I know this stuff in my head.

I find when people see someone throw a disc 300'+ they get a lot more interested. The more exposure disc golf gets the more seriously it gets taken.  Now, I don't want to knock anyone elses sport, but I think Cornhole might have a little more trouble getting taken seriously. I also think that has a lot to do with them calling the sport ""Cornhole"".. around here we call it bean bag toss.. maybe not an original name but maybe one that would be less distracting from the actual sport."

Just out of interest, I started a shot timer countdown many times, in that round, and every single player blew the hell out of the 30 second shot clock.  I think the TD should insist that the 30 second rule be rigidly adhered to, except when disturbances are caused by spectators.  I understand this is the very top level, but the rule is there for a reason - to keep play flowing, and to prevent players gaming the wind.  I was surprised no one started calling time on the players."

My wife actually bought this bag for me over a year ago because she said ""you look stupid carrying a giant bag of discs around with you"".  I sarcastically said thanks, and hung it up in my closet leaving it unused for a long time.  I decided to pull it out and actually use it a few months ago and freaking love it.

A couple rounds into having the bag the seam at the top of one of the pockets developed a hole, from not being sewn in deep enough. I still played with it every weekend for 3 months and just recently got in touch with the company. I sent them some pictures and they got a new one out to me right away, and I just filled it. It was a bit of a squeeze, but once I get started with it and it breaks in a little they'll fit just as comfortably as the older one.

You could but you struggle getting them out and will warp certain types of plastic easily in just one round of playing. I contacted  Upper Park Designs about the storage  issue and they told me to put a bunch of mids that I don't care about warping in the pockets for a week or so and that will ""stretch"" the pockets out. I did that and still found it frustrating to get my discs in and out and still tended to warp discs. Also if you use the camel back it keeps portions of your discs cold which leads to less grip on the cold/wet side of the discs. There were more things I didn't like about the bag but I could've lived with those other small issues. If I was you I would just spend the $$$ and get the Grip C15 bag. Worth every penny."

discgolf,3ct24t,Shidell,18,Fri Jul 10 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"This is a complex issue.  Let's take it step by step.   First, the flight numbers are just rough estimates of how a disc might act in a given set of conditions (i.e. a certain player with certain arm speed at certain elevation in certain weather conditions).  Turn, in particular, is a very hard number to quantify because virtually all of these factors affect it.  Yes, a lack of turn might indicate you don't have the arm speed for a given disc.  It could also mean, however, that you're throwing in a higher altitude (which would result in a disc acting more stable) or throwing at a warmer time of year (which would also make a disc act more stable).  By contrast, the ""fade"" number is pretty constant regardless of arm speed.  Once the disc hits the low speed portion of its flight, fade tends to act the same for everyone, regardless of how far you throw.     Second, the ""turn"" number on a disc assumes correct throwing form.  This includes, most importantly, correct nose angle.  If you throw a disc nose up, it will tend to act more stable.  So, as you can see, you might have the arm speed for a disc, but are throwing it nose up, and it's acting more stable than normal.  High speed drivers in particular (like destroyers) are VERY sensitive to nose angle, so this could be the issue as well.    Third, you seem to be making the assumption that turn = throwing the disc at proper speed.  However, this isn't always the case.  Some discs are designed to be overstable enough that they won't turn under virtually ANY speed.  So turn isn't the end all be all indicator of correct arm speed for a disc.  Really, you need to look at how the disc behaves overall compared to what it's purported numbers are.    So, having said all that, it's possible you have enough arm for the destroyer but aren't throwing it properly or are at a higher elevation or some other factor that's affecting the flight.  Given how you describe the flight of your archangel, I doubt that's the case, but it's a possibility.  You're probably correct that the destroyer is ""too fast for your arm.""  However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's useless to you.  While using discs closer to your arm speed is good because it let's you get truer flights, if your form is good, the faster discs can still be beneficial.  Here's an example.  I bag two worlds.  I throw 350-400 which really a bit below what it's intended speed is.  If Dave Feldberg throws that disc, he gets a slight turn out of it and it goes 450-500.  For me, it goes flat and straight and finishes hard left at about 350.  For Dave it's a driver he uses for distance.  For me, it's a drive I use for a good reliable hyzer finish.  If dave wants a good straight flight with a reliable hyzer finish he's probably using an enforcer.  For me, that's way too much disc for what I need.  So I take a disc that is intended to be thrown faster to get it's true flight and use the fact that my arm speed isn't fast enough for that ""true"" flight to use it for something else.    In regards to your teebird issue, I would bet money that it's just beat in.  DX Teebirds will have a very slight amount of turn at full power for me when new.  A test material river is going to turn pretty well for me when new.  So you getting different flights tells me it's probably a wear issue.    EDIT I just reread your question and caught something.  Just because a disc is turning too much does not mean it's not fast enough for you.  If you look at pro players bags, they're using a broad array of discs with a bunch of speeds from fast to slow.  Ignoring the discs he uses just for putting, Paul McBeth is using a Nova (spd. 2), Roc 3 (spd. 5), Teebird (spd. 7) Thundebird (spd. 9), Firebird (spd. 9), Krait (spd. 11), and Destroyers (spd. 12).  McBeth definitely has the arm speed to get true flights out of destroyers but is using slower speed discs still.  Why?  Because each one goes different distances and has different flight lines.  Generally speaking, you want to use the slowest disc you can to get the shot you need because slower discs tend to be more controllable.  So no, I wouldn't ditch the Teebird.  In fact, I would tell you that you need to get yourself a mid or two and probably a putter if you don't have one and maybe buy a newer teebird."
discgolf,3ct24t,jmkreth,3,Fri Jul 10 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"This is really informative. Thanks for clarifying some of these points.  I purchased DX discs to get a ""feel"" for discs before investing in better plastic. (What good is paying an extra $10 for a GStar disc if you don't like it?) and while that seems like good logic, it also appears that some of these lesser plastics probably aren't giving me true flight patterns that I should expect, especially as time goes on. My DX discs have a lot of flights in them, including extraneous conditions (the River landed on a road and was run over, etc.)    I think investing in a newer TeeBird is probably a good call. I think I should probably get one in a better quality plastic, too, and see if that impacts how the disc seems to react for me. I would assume that it's my form affecting flight, but any time I drive with my TeeBird, it goes over like it has a big amount of turn--and all I can assume is that those tendencies are because it's too ""beat."""
discgolf,3ct24t,jmkreth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"FWIW, a brand new teebird in either champ or star plastic is a disc that I can't turn at all at full power when new.  The G-stars I can get the littlest bit of turn."
discgolf,3ct24t,SKCwillie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting. I would assume I have some wrist turn or other form problems (and I probably do), but the TeeBird's flight pattern is very similar to the Archangel's (my TeeBird has many, many more flights than the Archangel does) and that leads me to believe that maybe it's just ""worn out"", as others have mentioned.  I'm going to pick up a new one in a better plastic and then I can compare and come back with some results."
discgolf,3ct24t,Auriyon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:02:58 2015 UTC,"How does your River compare to your teebird? And what are the weights? If you Archangel flies like your TB, you're doing something wrong or that TB is really beat up."
discgolf,3ct24t,jmkreth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"When I throw my River, it flies straight as an arrow--almost no turn or fade. It goes way out on a line.   If it matters, my River is in the limited edition test run material (I picked it up on a whim for $4 from a local course dealer), and the Teebird and Archangel are DX. The Destroyer is Star. All of them are 175g."
discgolf,3ct24t,bombmk,3,Fri Jul 10 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"Well I mean its possible since your Teebird is DX that it just got beat up and is now super flippy. If you want a true straight flyer, get a Star Teebird in 168g-171g. If you haven't experimented with lighter weights, especially for drives, you really should. Even Paul McBeth's Teebirds are like 169ish I believe. You don't have to throw max weight stuff (especially overstable distance drivers) - very few people have that kind of arm."
discgolf,3ct24t,SKCwillie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"Auriyon has some good stuff here.  Personally, at my power, the only drivers I have at 175 are ones that I specifically want to fight the wind.  Any other driver is going to be around 170ish unless I want it to go further or have a higher tendency to turn, in which case it will be closer to 165."
discgolf,3ct24t,mtndewgood,2,Fri Jul 10 17:44:34 2015 UTC,The test run material is definitely on the understable side if you hold the different plastics up against each other. Same weight in Opto will be significantly more stable.
discgolf,3ct24t,MrFirmHandshake,2,Fri Jul 10 21:15:42 2015 UTC,Star plastic will definitely be more beefy than DX. I had a test run River and it was crazy flippy for me. With DX everything wears in fast and becomes really understable. The Destroyer is definitely too much disc. Try finding a 168-170 Teebird or River in champion/opto plastic and you'll see the difference in stability.
discgolf,3ct24t,GrimlinJoe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:36:51 2015 UTC,A Teebird shouldn't fly like anything like an Archangel unless its beat to piss or you're turning your wrist over. If you're buying a new Teebird to look for turn there shouldn't be any as it has 0%hst. Hence the third letter in the flight plate being 0. Do some checks on http://www.inboundsdiscgolf.com

I just picked up a star teebird and Valkyrie there a couple weeks ago. Both were stickered at $21 but they only charged $14. If you go through the checkout process on their website it will give you the actual amount rather than the sticker price.   As an aside, they seem like pretty good guys. I will definitely be shopping there again."

discgolf,3ct6hn,ihasaredbeard,2,Fri Jul 10 16:10:09 2015 UTC,My buddy has one and seems to enjoy it. The one problem with the bag is that it doesn't really have any support built in.

For $30-40 you can't beat it, really.  I may make some modifications later like beefing up padding on shoulder straps and top joint for straps, but its pretty solid still.  I will probably destroy it in 2-3 years but that's still better than having a $180 bag last 5-6.  Also the bag is pretty stable as long as its 2/3rd full or so, and just keeping the top pockets zipped up helps the stability in picking it up/setting it down tremendously."

I don't think you can find another bag close to it in features and construction for under a hundred bucks...definitely not for under 50.  Note: I'm not talking out of my ass here, I actually have a Grip EQ and my brother has a magellan bag, so I'm intimately familiar with both.  If I did not have a Grip bag already or did not want to spend that kind of money on a DG bag...it is definitely what I'd get.  What I would recommend is get one, do the corrugated plastic support instead of the PVC frame (there's a youtube video somewhere explaining that), and maybe consider plasti-dipping or waterproofing the bottom, and then stop stressing over a bag and enjoy it :P"

discgolf,3cqraz,aDramaticPause,2,Sun Jul 12 17:06:38 2015 UTC,"I just played this yesterday. Really great, impressive 9 hole course. True pro par distance. Some of the images look like it's too wide open, but it's not. Challenging as hell. Really enjoyed it, looking forward to them grooming it as time goes by hopefully upgrading the tee pads, adding in benches, etc - and eventually adding the back 9. From the work that you can see they put into this (and the obvious money) I have no doubts they'll keep improving it."
discgolf,3cqraz,ExploreDiscGolf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:24:51 2015 UTC,Glad you like the distance.  It actually came partially out of necessity to connect the property together.  Its a big area and we wanted to hit all the good spots without too much walking between holes.  We did scout out a back 9 and have some good ideas if Pineland Farms wants it to happen.
discgolf,3cqraz,aDramaticPause,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info - safe to assume you were involved with the design of it? By your last comment, it sounds like they don't have concrete plans yet to do the back 9? That's too bad, I was hoping they had confirmed that. I think this could be one of my favorite courses in the state one day if they can do the back 9 as well. Thanks again."
discgolf,3cqraz,soundscapemerch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, we were the designers of the course. Born and raised Mainers :)  Pineland Farms only had a grant for 9 holes, but our firm has Master Planned a back 9, incase the front 9 is successful enough to merit one.  For some insight, the Master Planned back 9 is out across the road past the 6th basket (hence the longer walk to 7 tee). Technically, 7-9 are holes 16-18 in the Master Planned course."

discgolf,3cso74,shaftygoodness,4,Fri Jul 10 13:29:38 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the Ace man! I hit the post on that hole a couple months ago and thought for sure I had it but I'll have to wait for my first ace a little longer haha.   I do agree with most of the other people though I probably wouldn't have tagged the hole. I understand your argument that you pay the taxes for the state park and you pay to park. What you wrote was't vulgar or obscene but what everyone is trying to say is that if we mark up the course its going to look trashy. Sure the park has money but there is still only a certain budget they put towards the course. There are other things that require maintaining at the park and you paying your taxes doesn't entitle you to mark up the property. Just imagine for a second what the place would look like if everything was covered in sharpie. I played there last week and I was pretty disappointed with the amount of trash I saw on the course. I know you were excited and all and I get that (being that i still haven't hit an ace after 4 years of play) but we all play on the same course. The overwhelming majority of people would rather not have the park marked up. It just looks bad. When the people who get to decide the budget walk around and see the place marked up and trash everywhere do you think anyone is going to want to fund that? Probably not. If we like the courses we play at we should just try our best to maintain them. Don't look for hope of an ace in the tags left on the park, just know you have what it takes to make it happen. Good luck man, hope you have many more aces to come."
discgolf,3cso74,wetanwild99,2,Fri Jul 10 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"This guy gets it  And the park has exactly $0 to do with the course, as in the line item for the Borderland Disc Golf course in the DCR budget is $0.  Everything from the baskets, the flypads, down to the screws holding the next tee sign was paid for by donation.  Basically, when someone marks up a tee sign with a ace tag they're giving the finger to Dean (the guy who dug the hole, poured the concrete & planted that exact tee sign) and the hundreds of volunteers who've helped out on the course over the decades."

discgolf,3cso74,SKCwillie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"I personally have no issue with people signing the posts, as long as the following are observed:    1) It's on something that doesn't obscure anything of consequence, like the post (in other words, don't sign the actual sign that has yardage, pictures, etc)  2) It's a small notation that leaves plenty of room for other signatures.  3) Doesn't include any vulgar or offensive terms.    I'm kinda with the op on this.  I think seeing the mark gives people, especially newer players, hope.  And honestly, until I came to this sub, I had no idea this was so disliked by some (no one I've talked to at the course near me seem offended by it at all).  Maybe the feelings on this are different from region to region (or maybe even course to course).  Now, pointless graffiti like charging stations I hate.  Please don't think I put these two in the same category."

discgolf,3cso74,fusneety,4,Fri Jul 10 17:58:01 2015 UTC,In that case I hope you never get very good. Just b/c you feel like it's okay to do doesn't make it right to do... You are harming the work of others purely as an act of vanity. The people with 10 or 12 aces don't feel the need to mark each one b/c that would be ridiculous and there would be graffiti everywhere.   Just like people who routinely make ace runs don't feel the need to go tell people on the internet who absolutely do not care. Sorry to sound harsh but this is something I find unacceptable.

Also, Corey`s Bicycle Shop is to the south in Pearland. They have a large variety of brands and molds.  Rick`s Darts and Games to the west on Westheimer also has a lot of discs, although it is probably 80-90% Innova. I heard they got in a large shipment of Axiom/MVP recently, though."

discgolf,3cssos,love_lagunitas,2,Sun Jul 12 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Bellamy Park is the local spot. Free to play, impressively well-maintained by the regulars, and an excellent shop (Walter's) on site. My only gripe is that being a free course, situated in a public park, and so close to the university, the foot traffic is typically pretty high. It gets especially crowded on league/doubles nights, so you'll want to be aware of that. There are also some public athletic fields right next door, which is great for practicing drives etc. off-the-course if they aren't being used. As a newer player, I spend a lot of time doing field work here, so feel free to stop by and introduce yourself if you happen to see me!  If you're an entry level player, definitely also check out Moose Mountain in Brookfield, NH. It's about a 30min drive up Route 16. Very well maintained, shorter and more open holes, and hardly ever crowded. $5/round or $8 for the day. Play a round with Tex if he's there; he's the course designer and a really entertaining dude.  Salmon Falls and Squamanagonic are also nearby in Rochester. Squam is a very very nice course, but far enough above my skill level that I don't typically have a great time there. I don't think I've been there this year, though. I haven't played Salmon Falls yet, but I've heard it's coming along nicely. I'm not sure if it's complete yet."

You get to use the disc you are already comfortable with.  The tape glows brighter and longer than glow discs.    Remember to put a strip of tape on the top and bottom.  Make sure your disc is completely dry before applying tape.  I have seen tape come off once after a massive tree hit.

A roll of glow tape lasts me a long time."

discgolf,3cs4r5,jawnnyp,2,Fri Jul 10 20:05:20 2015 UTC,That doesn't fuck up the flight of the disc?
discgolf,3cs4r5,agoia,2,Fri Jul 10 15:28:35 2015 UTC,A few strips of tape on each side doesn't have a dramatic impact on the flight.
discgolf,3cs4r5,ticklethetruth,2,Fri Jul 10 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"So the best way, bar none, to charge glow discs is with a UV flashlight. You can get them at like Wal-Mart and department stores and shit. Just give the disc a nice light shine and it should glow for a pretty good while.  Also, the best glow disc is definitely the Glow C-line MD3 from Discmania, though you can only get them from the Discmania store so its no the most affordable option. Alternatively, you can buy glow in the dark duct tape that you can put on any disc that works surprisingly well. You don't even have to put too much on - when its that dark out the glow really stands out."
discgolf,3cs4r5,Auriyon,2,Fri Jul 10 12:19:50 2015 UTC,"I suggest buying some loose LED lights(white), quarter size 3V batteries and clear packing tape.  Tape them to your disc top and bottom and it should work for the round."

discgolf,3cs4r5,agoia,2,Fri Jul 10 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"The single brightest glow disc in my experience was the Steady Ed Glow Fly by DGA -- good luck finding one now, tho.  Gateway's Glow Wizards are awesome too.  Another great disc was the Fly By Night Owl, a Roc-like disc designed to fly with two 8 inch glow bracelets wedged into the rim.  However, glowing up the discs mid round ruins your night vision so I usually just tape a few mini glow sticks to the underside -- they work great to supercharge any glow disc and can also light up most any clear/dayglow champion disc as well."
discgolf,3cs4r5,deathputt4birdie,2,Fri Jul 10 15:47:07 2015 UTC,Never played but I think the way to go are those little lights you hook up to the discs. Glow discs need to be recharged to much for my liking
discgolf,3cs4r5,Grgy,3,Fri Jul 10 11:43:39 2015 UTC,This is the way to go.  I've played dozens of round with these lights.    Strap them on with some clear duct tape and you're good to go.  Translucent/champion type plastic work the best but lighter colors of star type plastic will still light up enough to able to find it in the dark.
discgolf,3cs4r5,RowdyRaider79,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the feedback!  I would have never thought to use a UV flashlight, but that's a brilliant idea, no pun intended.  I've decided to go with both the glow tape and the mvp eclipse plastic.  The glow tape sounds like it's the most effective method for night golf, so I'll do that, but the eclipse just fucking looks cool.  So I'll get both, fuck it, why not?  I want to do this the right way, so money isn't that much of a factor.  I'm willing to spend a little extra on some solid glow tape, a couple of high powered UV lights, and a new disc or two.  I also thought about picking up a space blanket and using that to line the inside of my light box.    Anyway, thanks r/discgolf, you folks are the shit!

discgolf,3croq8,3Wheel,2,Fri Jul 10 05:56:21 2015 UTC,"How to you actually play an ace race?   You receive 2 prototype disc of the same mold. TD's will typically set up temporary tee positions about 100 feet out of the basket and players take turns throwing from there for how ever many rounds the race is set to go for.    I know it goes off of ace and metal hits. But are 5 metal hit worth more then one ace? Or does an ace beat everything?   Metal hits are only used in case of ties. More aces win over however many metal hits someone with less aces has.   What if no one hits an ace or the basket? Do you just do a ctp?   It should be set up so this doesn't happen in the first place. Probably up to the TD how to go about it if no one hits.   What if there is a tie?   Metal hits break ties. Playoff might happen if that's a tie to or TD might call a draw?   Do you throw both your discs or just one?   Just one each hole. Players can pick from a wide range of weights so you can get a lighter flipper disc and a heavier more stable one for shot variety.    Can I have everyone throw both discs off drive to encourage aces?   Yes.   Do you play the whole hole like a normal round or do you just drive off tee and move to the next hole?   Drive and move on.   What were some things you liked and disliked about ace races you've been to?   I didn't like missing my only ace race I could attend this year. That was a bummer.    Would a Saturday or Sunday be better for players?   Personally, I think Sundays are better. Less likely to get called into work on a Sunday."

discgolf,3croq8,BRUNdmc,2,Fri Jul 10 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"What were some things you liked and disliked about ace races you've been to?   Love when the TD throws in the gimmicky holes. Multiple baskets side by side, or stacked in a pyramid. It's a great reminder that it's really all about having fun and not taking it too seriously. Also who doesn't love throwing at a basket pyramid from 100ft."
discgolf,3croq8,yesiam8833,2,Sat Jul 11 03:16:48 2015 UTC,Oh many I might have to try this one. Sounds like a blast. Truly a great idea! Thank you for the input.
discgolf,3croq8,cubeofsoup,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a point system 5 point for ace, 3 point for Chain, and 1 point for metal.  The one after 2 round with the most point wins.  You will also need to understand how many player pack you will need to order.  I believe the min is 50 player pack.  On setting up, how many people will be helping you?  If you have a lot of people this would make it easier if you divide up the work such as course setup, signing players up, and getting out player packs.  Make sure you have the course reserved for that day for your ACE race and post sign indicating the course is close for that day.    Our event has about 15 people helping, that's because we get over 100 people signing up then another 20-30 people walkups.  In order to speed play we setup another 9 holes so we have a shot gun start with no more than 5 people per card/hole.  In between round we have prizes for long throw for each group (men, women, children under 15).  We also give out CTP prizes for one hole in the 1st round per scorecard.  If you have a small group around 50 people, I suggest try to keep it simple by using the hole already on the course and use the flag ACE races provide to setup temp teepads.  At 4 person per hole for 50 people, that would take up 13 holes for shot gun start.    Good luck and have fun..."
discgolf,3croq8,agoia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:02:27 2015 UTC,"IMO aces should win over chain/metal no matter what.  so, 1x ace should beat 2x chain.  after all, the event is the ACE race, not the Almost-Ace Race."
discgolf,3croq8,smuttr,2,Fri Jul 10 14:42:19 2015 UTC,I agree. As possible TD of an event I would probably have players use both disc off tee just to encourage aces. Because hiring the basket is nice but having your disc inside a basket is even better. And the ACEs would count over chain/basket hits. If the rookie Jerry Rubkiss comes out and hits an ace one time. Versus Veteran Chad Legitness hitting the basket 4 times. I believe Rubkiss should get the grand prize because like it says it's an ace race.

Double sets of decent chains, they could stand to be a bit heavier though. Its a nice cheap basket in my little experience. It screws together with 3 poles. It weighs around 27 lbs, so its not super heavy, still pretty portable. It can be disassembled back to approximately the size of the basket itself. Takes 5-10 minutes to assemble, most time consuming part is attaching each chain strand."

At 8 he still has minimal grip strength, and minimal ability to snap a disc as a result.  Ultralight discs of any kind, will at least allow how to hang on to them long enough to accelerate them.  Trying very hard is exactly what he shouldn't be doing, as that ruins throws.  You could both practice the towel drill to radically improve your snap, and film each other to see if you can pull a towel down a line and snap it.  But light discs are the absolute key. Giving him a 170gm disc is like you trying to throw a garbage can lid with a 2 kilo weight in it."

discgolf,3cru5c,BareM4nPig,3,Fri Jul 10 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"When i started playing I used an omega super soft, then switched to the SS wizard (I liked the bead). I used it for a while until I started to realize my putting style wasn't working, i was literally pitching it hoping it would fade to the basket.  I then switched to the ridge when it was released. My first run Ridge was a little stiff, so I ordered a medium soon after. As I practiced I realized my grip and the flight (inside 50ft) was mor consistent with the harder disc. I ordered another hard one. My putting game took a big step up, I was making like 60 percent from the circles edge (big for me only playing twice a month).  Then the Dagger came out... I've always loved the way feldberg throws and I feel like my swing is like his. I bought a few daggers to start out, mediums. They were ok, I used them because I knew hard ones were going to be released soon. I was putting about the same, maybe a few longer putts made here and there. But when the hard ones were in my hand I knew I found my putter. Now if it's withing 40 I know I can hit metal. If I miss 60 is cause I missed high.  The hard plastic gives me confidence. I pull my 2 putters out of my putter pocket and the both have the same feel, whether it 30 degrees or 120 degrees."

Love the feel of a gummy and use to use it for short puts, but the stiffer version has now taken on full time duty   Actually gonna drop my gummy version for a even funnier different disc for utility shots that I need to stick"
discgolf,3cru5c,Grgy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:30:18 2015 UTC,"I'll just parrot the ""confidence"" point that people are already making and add my 2 cents.  For a lot of players (myself included), floppier plastic affects their anticipated line of release.  For a line as precise as a putt, I want to remove as many variables as possible; I don't want a thought nagging me that maybe the disc will bend a little right before I release, causing me to either miss my intended line or try to compensate at the last possible moment, resulting in a poor release.  Generally speaking, push-putters prefer stiffer plastic for that reason.  It's a low-spin throw without much glide, so there isn't much worry of an unfortunate spit-out.    Spin-putters often prefer floppier plastic, as it grabs chains and sits in the basket better than stiff plastic when the disc has more spin and velocity.   Spush/hybrid putters usually opt for something in-between - something grippy that feels soft but still stiff."
discgolf,3cru5c,okie_solidarity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:07:57 2015 UTC,"When I'm throwing a softer disc it feels more wobbly, whereas I like to use a firmer disc like my Retro Judge because I throw it more confidently.

discgolf,3cru5c,agoia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:22:27 2015 UTC,I use hard putters in the summer because it's too hot for my normal medium putters.  They get too floppy in the heat.

You know, the ones you can literally mush into a ball they're so soft. Well, I learned how inconsistent they were. I'd be practicing and realize I couldn't hold the thing flat because of how floppy it was. I've recently fallen in love with the mvp ion because I love how small they feel. I can't stand how the soft proton plastic feels. I even traded a disc to a guy who used to throw them and a beat in proton feels too soft. I feel stiff plastic gives me more consistency."
discgolf,3cru5c,Tugboliass,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:53:53 2015 UTC,"It's 99% a personal preference thing. Softer putters do tend to stick to the ground better on upshots, as others have said. But strictly putting wise, it's just preference. The putter you find most comfortable in your hand will be the best putter for you.   Personally I've switched over to Classic Soft Wardens. Those, for me, feel perfect, and will never roll away on a jump putt. I use a Classic Blend Warden for off the tee, just for that extra bit of stability."
discgolf,3cru5c,Ir_77,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"Feldberg says a soft putter means your grip changes slightly depending on how much pressure you put on it. Because the pressure often changes during the putting motion, and the release, a flexible disc can result in the throw not going where your grip wants to send it.  I often put in the wind with a Zero Soft Sinus, but that soft isn't floppy like an Omega Super Soft or a soft Banger GT, for example.  My preferred putting putters are a Neutron Ion for shorter putts and a Dagger for longer putts where I need the disc to float further. http://www.latitude64.se/latest-news/the-dagger"
discgolf,3cru5c,M0b1u5,0,Sun Jul 12 04:59:57 2015 UTC,"Hard putters are going to be better for you to use as an approach/short driver. Soft putters are hard to throw consistently if you are going to use them in the 80-200 foot range.   Soft putters are generally preferred for closer shots, as they have less tendency to take hard bounces and rolls. Many players just enjoy the feel of a stiffer putter better and feel like their confidence in their throw is worth the trade-off."

A public place, like a park, is a shared resource. It belongs to all of us. When some twat marks it with graffiti, he is saying that no, what he wants to do is more important than everyone else. He takes a shared public thing and turns it into his easel for his stupid doodle.  If the people wanted a stupid fucking doodle on their park bench, the committee that put it there would have installed it with one in the first place. They did not. They installed a pristine one, nice to look at, uniform in appearance. Everyone can use it just like that, and appreciate it.    You want a display space for your art? Paint a mural on the wall of your building. Scrawl on the benches in your garden.

If theres a trash can there is no reason your 40 oz bottle is laying on the outside of the can.  Sure, graffiti sucks, but depending on where it is, you can cover it up.  Also, if the course designer was that worried about their benches, they'd paint the shit with scotch guard essentially.  Ya know that stuff they sell that you can paint your walls with so your kids drawings wash away, ha newsflash, paint a bench with that, and just take a hose to it.  Look no more graffiti.

discgolf,3cpz7t,arkiverge,2,Fri Jul 10 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the colors of the discs are why I chose to try them out."
discgolf,3cpz7t,arkiverge,2,Fri Jul 10 13:05:19 2015 UTC,"I probably spend an order of magnitude less time looking for discs now thanks to MVP's color options (the bright pink/yellow are piercingly hard to miss).  Really though, the big pull for me is the narrower rim width on their drivers fits my smaller hands a ton better than most other driver manufacturers."
discgolf,3cpz7t,FiefMaster,5,Fri Jul 10 14:21:34 2015 UTC,"It wasn't an intentional move, but my bag is officially full MVP as of last month.  Great plastic and great discs made by a group of guys that have more knowledge and experience on overmolding than the rest of the disc industry combined."
discgolf,3cpz7t,sparrowcloud,2,Fri Jul 10 01:47:43 2015 UTC,Mine is starting to get that way too.
discgolf,3cpz7t,love_lagunitas,2,Fri Jul 10 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"The Ion really changed my game. I never would've started driving with putters if I wouldn't have picked one up on /r/discexchange. They make some great plastic and have good glide.  I now carry 5 MVP discs in my bag (nutsac): first run Plasma amp,  Neutron Ion, Plasma Ion, Neutron volt, and Neutron axis. Just picked up a Neutron Crave that I think may take the place of the volt.  Despite my love of MVP plastic, they will never kick out my saint, harp, or drone."
discgolf,3cpz7t,withkatepierson,2,Sat Jul 11 02:13:57 2015 UTC,Me Too
discgolf,3cpz7t,durkaflurkaflame,3,Sat Jul 11 16:55:10 2015 UTC,Mhm. They do what they are supposed to do. And are great for flicking. Got a Westside disc and can't flick it at all :/
discgolf,3cpz7t,TheSpanky49,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:00:00 2015 UTC,You are missing out on life's rich pageant of discs. MVP might be fine but other firms are fine as well.
discgolf,3cpz7t,durkaflurkaflame,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:59:32 2015 UTC,"I do have others, but I just cant get them to fly like these."

discgolf,3cpz7t,Lovemesomediscgolf,0,Fri Jul 10 13:27:36 2015 UTC,"what the fuck am I going to do with my 30 teebirds and piles of Pigs if I switch? It ain't doable unless if MVP gives me a ton of money or guaranteed, daily old fashions."
discgolf,3cpz7t,MysticalMuffDiver,-9,Sat Jul 11 04:45:46 2015 UTC,"Mike, is that you?"
discgolf,3cpz7t,durkaflurkaflame,4,Fri Jul 10 03:04:07 2015 UTC,"Can we cut the immature bullshit in this sub?  It's really not good natured fun if that's what you think it is. Seeing people join in on another round of mocking Mike C is very unfortunate and leaves a bad taste in my mouth - I can't be the only one here who reacts that way to this. And there is no reason for it; the guy has done nothing but post his videos and well thought out opinions on this sub. Or rather if you have good reasons for mocking him, please post them. I'd love to see them.  This is a great community in many ways. In some ways, it is a childish community. Jokes should not be made at another user's expense as a matter of course - there should be no meme about making fun of another user, and that's where this is headed if its not already there."
discgolf,3cpz7t,durkaflurkaflame,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:25:22 2015 UTC,"Harrumph Harrumph!  On the serious side, I'm with /u/CorneliusNepos .  Although I've never met Mike, from what I can tell he's a damn good disc golfer, and decent man.  Let's not single people out...we have a lot of newcomers to the sport who will be coming in this sub to learn about disc golf, and they will turn away if they see people getting mocked.  Show them the true camaraderie in this sport by being supportive."
discgolf,3cpz7t,Auriyon,3,Fri Jul 10 12:54:01 2015 UTC,I'm a new comer and if I didn't love disc golf so much I wouldn't be a part of this community. It's a joke already if you ask me. There are serial down voters who down vote everything. For a sub like this it's a bad thing because it reduces the visibility of a comment. On a daily basis there are three new ace pictures on the front page that do absolutely nothing but toot the horn of the op. You got people that rehash jokes about mike and his love of mvp. There are meme posts about your reaction when x happens. The list goes on and on. It's just not a very good sub overall in my opinion. That being said there is usually one really quality discussion post a day and I guess that makes trudging through the shit worth it.
discgolf,3cp6gu,iGetJokes,2,Thu Jul 9 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"I'm still mad at myself for never making the drive up to Sawmills when I lived in hickory. I played the course at glenn hilton all the time, and never knew that sawmills was better."
discgolf,3cp6gu,Obvious_Moose,2,Thu Jul 9 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"I cut my teeth at Glenn Hilton when it was just 18. I still love it, but Sawmills is on point!"
discgolf,3cp6gu,Vermillions54,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:40:37 2015 UTC,It's plays more difficult than Glenn from the blues.  Some of the shots are just ridiculous.
discgolf,3cp6gu,Vermillions54,2,Fri Jul 10 00:17:49 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I've hit all those trees.  Love that course.  It beats in my disc so quickly.
discgolf,3cp6gu,luckless_pedestrian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:01:00 2015 UTC,I suggest cranking the sawmill back up -- too many trees!
discgolf,3cp6gu,Obvious_Moose,3,Thu Jul 9 18:55:34 2015 UTC,In NC we don't play disc golf. We play plinko.
discgolf,3cr501,Grimario,3,Fri Jul 10 02:45:01 2015 UTC,I have his number let me text him
discgolf,3cr501,BaconDG,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:41:11 2015 UTC,Cheers. He should have an email from Luke/South Australian Disc Golf waiting for him with some info in it.
discgolf,3cs08v,jlu10,3,Fri Jul 10 08:24:46 2015 UTC,"I tried a few before purchasing udisc, but even though I only get to play a round or two a week udisc is definitely worth the money. $3 isn't much, plus it has tons of other features besides score keeping."
discgolf,3cs08v,TheBilbOno,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:26:14 2015 UTC,"Udisc is awesome.  The developer responds to emails, too, and is open to suggestions"
discgolf,3cs08v,OSU09,2,Sat Jul 11 01:48:14 2015 UTC,uDisc is 100% worth it. It keeps track of your stats really well which is even more important when you play more spread out. You get a better idea of your progress over time since you don't have a bunch of games in a row to show it to you. I mean... it's $3. A cup of coffee can cost more than that.
discgolf,3cs08v,ihasaredbeard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:28:05 2015 UTC,I use the PDGA app - free and it works and can email rounds or psot to facebook.  Basic but useful
discgolf,3cs08v,rhatton1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:46:04 2015 UTC,"On iOS the PDGA app is $2  Try discasaurus, I believe it's free. I don't know of many other apps aside from uDisc"
discgolf,3cs08v,paintray98,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:59:39 2015 UTC,I use Disc Score.  I like it but will probably be switching to UDisc soon.
discgolf,3cs08v,stickipedia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:27:36 2015 UTC,I use discasaurus. It's free and has an online database that has been tracking all my scores since the beginning. Can also send an email to everyone I'm playing with at the end of the round
discgolf,3cpm9p,AtomicDom85,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:35:56 2015 UTC,That's where I got my first discs. Dicks has a better selection
discgolf,3cpm9p,SwiftBacon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"got my first discs at a walmart, then found the had a better selection at dick's (although, during my last visit dick's only had 8 discs, not 8 different molds, 8 discs total...)  Then I found Air Traffic.  They've got a really nice selection."
discgolf,3cpm9p,loupgarou21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:42:32 2015 UTC,They have portable baskets for $99.  Frequent mPerks for Innova or Sporting Goods to knock those base prices down.
discgolf,3cpm9p,tonydelbarrio,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:04:14 2015 UTC,"Cincinnati here and our Meijer has a decent selection as well.  All Innova and mostly DX plastic, but they have a lot of beginner friendly molds.  They had a few high speed discs and a few champ plastic discs but mostly DX beginner type discs."
discgolf,3cpm9p,RedShirtDecoy,2,Fri Jul 10 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"That was my experience as well. My rack didn't have champ plastic but a few pro plastics. If I recall right the discs were Sidewinder, Skeeter, Aviar, Destroyer, Pro Beast, Cobra, Viking, and Pro Boss"
discgolf,3cpm9p,Cheese1423,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:25:56 2015 UTC,Also in Louisville. I bought a Innova skill shot there as they had a 20% off sporting goods item so got it for 80. I love meijer. If you're looking for another good store the new academy sports have a few more and bags and such.
