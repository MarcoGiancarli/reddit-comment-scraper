If I were to run Whonix in a VM on top of Ubuntu, would I really need the tablet functionality?   That depends on what you do. Do you draw? Do you intend to take handwriting notes?

If you've experienced the wonders and joys of the TN panels Lenovo likes to put in Thinkpads... you'd take the IPS option.  The viewing angle thing also helped me whenever I had to use my laptop in class. My college had some cramped-ass classrooms and lecture halls, and there wasn't much room to adjust the screen for better viewing angles if I was using it on my lap.  Maybe your college is different though.  Bonus points for the resolution bump.

The mechanism has been the same for both with varying levels of travel for X1, X250, T450s etc. It also means backlighting will work without having to re-engineer the classic keycaps.  I haven't seen a 7 row mockup with chiclet keys yet, and considering the questions in the Lenovo Blog polls, I decided to make one.  Taken from:  X230   chiclet keys Fn+Space for lighting, I don't think the clunky ""zoom"" is more useful than one handed lighting   Original Retro ThinkPad:   media keys numpad overlay menu button & Windows logo caps lock indicator   X220:   forward/back buttons   I personally think this with full 2.5mm key travel would be the best of both worlds. There can be a non-backlit version for those who like matte keys (smooth is the nature of backlighting), both made by LiteOn, of course. What do you guys think?  P.S. Can someone with more than my rudimentary Photoshop skills make the enter key blue?"
thinkpad,3e0mga,NeXT_Step,3,Tue Jul 21 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the ""Retro Thinkpad"" must have the classic keys.

This is why I'm doubtful of this ""Retro Thinkpad"" project. If Lenovo goes for classic keys, then all those who prefer chiclet keys would go for the T460 instead - shrinking an already puny market. Same goes for every other feature."

They work great. Of note:   The processor is, indeed, not fast. It's fine for any of the things you've mentioned (including VMs, assuming you don't try something stupid like virtualizing Windows), but if you have heavy processing in mind, do it elsewhere. Recent hardware stagnation works in your favor here, because a seven-year-old processor now is much less obsolete than a seven-year-old processor ten (or even just five) years ago would have been. Using Linux works in your favor, too, as the OS will sit more lightly on the hardware. Upgrade the RAM if whatever you get is not already maxed out. The x301 conveniently takes DDR3; the x300 takes DDR2, which is way more expensive (and was a significant part of my motivation to upgrade). Battery life is totally acceptable, but not amazing. You can probably hit five hours with the screen dimmed doing light work. Being macbook-sized is an unexpected perk: the huge glut of macbook accessories like sleeves and bags fit it perfectly. The 1.8"" drive is pretty much the pox of Thinkpads I like. (The x40, my daily driver before the x300, uses a 1.8"" PATA drive that doesn't exist anywhere else.)

That said, if you can live with the smaller screen,  lack of optical drive,  and slightly thicker (but overall more compact) build, I'd spring for an X201 with at least an I5.  It should be similarly priced in the used market, and I can vouch for using one as a daily driver to this day without the slightest hiccup."

The thing to remember is that a current Thinkpad with an i5 isn't all that much faster than a first gen one. The difference is mostly in heat output and graphics.

Unless you have some iron eyesight, I strongly recommend the T420s/T430s (slimline model). It is a spiritual successor, has larger, much better screen, and significantly higher performance all around.  X301 performance is also subpar as a Ultralow voltage C2D, can't play Rise of Nations well without getting really hot, but documents and web browsing should be fine with a bit more DDR3 RAM. VMs? Unless it is Windows XP, I think not.  Otherwise it's a great ThinkPad. The one that keeps all retro features and is thinner than a first gen Macbook Air.

Next, let's take it up a notch:   120-250 GB mSATA SSD ($50-150)   Install your OS and primary programs on the SSD and use the HDD that came with your laptop for storage. Now you have a speedy work machine for way less than what you would pay for for a less powerful modern laptop.

Any plans to use more than one storage drive?  One of the cheaper (in overall cost) solutions is to nab a used T420/T430 and max it out. You can stuff 16GB memory in there for your VMs, have up to 3 storage drives (if you like segregating your OSs or something), and get anywhere from 6-10 hours on the extended 9-cell battery depending on what you're doing.  Same thing with an X220/X230, except there's only room for 2 storage drives. And moar battery life.  I never had a problem lasting a day of classes (usually anywhere from 4-6 hours) with both my T420 and X220 before getting back to my office to charge.  The downside for the T420/T430 is the screen - compared to the FHD IPS panel on the Haswell generation and newer, it's nothing to write home about (I have the 1600x900 TN). Sometimes I wish it had a higher-res panel, but I don't particularly need it.  Same thing for the X220/X230 - you max out at 1366x768 IPS. That one got annoying enough for me to switch to the T420.  There are 3rd-party adapters in the works for upgrading the panels on the T420/T430 and X220/X230, but iono if you're willing to do that much work."

You can experiment with a laptop that's no risk to your savings.  The reason experimentation is much better than being told to think is literally no one knows how you use and how you feel about your laptop.  Core i5 or i7? How much RAM? Storage? Resolution? Only (only!) you can know the answer by experiencing the difference.  A search for ""software developer"". I don't know what goes on in the heads of people who call themselves software developers and then ask for purchasing advice.

If you do this I'd go into it with a mindset that you might not sell items fast, and be prepared to maybe just break even at best.   Local sales would be convenient, but Ebay will probably be your best bet."
thinkpad,3du4xe,Nimiety_One,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:07:53 2015 UTC,Maybe if you stick 1200p screens in T500's but I still doubt you'd make a profit. Pretty much all the cheap thinkpads on kijiji are the same price though the specs are vastly different.  Thinkpads missing bluetooth/discreteGPU/bigHDDs go for the same price as something with it all & a dock with some monitors.
thinkpad,3du4xe,pm_me_your_rockets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"You won't make much money if any at all. There's only one recent profit scenario I've been in that's occurred more than once - buying T61s whose dGPU died and replacing the mobo with an integrated-GPU-only mobo. And that's only because I can get them from a local electronics recycler for around $30 a pop and get replacement mobos from ebay for $20 to $30. If I need to replace or upgrade anything more than the mobo then all profit prospects are pretty much shot.  Would you pay much more than $60 for a laptop that's the better part of 10 (!) years old? I know I wouldn't.  The only place I could see this remotely possibly flying is on the Thinkpad forums. Some people there fully mod-out T60s or T61s - I'm talking maxed-out CPUs, 8GB memory (8GB DDR2 is ridiculously expensive), the UXGA FlexView panel (hard to find, let alone find one in good condition), etc. And then sell them for $400+. Obviously people on the forums are buying them, but that's just too much money to play around with for me, especially when I can get a very nice T420/X220 or newer for that much.  Nostalgia ain't worth that much to me."

The Dell inspiron I had for her before that did not fare as well.   Thinkpads have the spill resistant keyboards, so as long as you mandate cups with lids anywhere near the computer you should be fine. I have tried the silicon keyboard covers but my kid figured out how to peel that off pretty quickly. Once in awhile we get crumb buildup in the crevice around the trackpoint which requires a sharp object to clean out.   Like someone else recommended a small SSD is a good idea - makes dealing with the computer much easier if you need to do anything to it.   If she breaks the t420 you would have no problem going cheaper - a t410 or t400 will handle anything that a little kid would want to do."

The only thing I'd consider doing from your list is adding a screen protector (but again, those can easily be subjugated through a 3yo's... creativity).  Other than adding an SSD as already mentioned, maybe adding further rubber feet to the bottom? To prevent him from easily sliding or pushing the thing around.  Honestly, I think your best bet is supervised use only and doing your best to teach him proper usage. Like no banging on the thing with his fists, pulling at the keys, etc. I know he's only 3yo, but none of your proposed solutions will do much if he just decides to drop it off the dining table.  Take solace in the fact that cosmetic replacement parts are cheap and plentiful on ebay. Educate yourself on what to do if he spills his juice in it."

Brightness and Keyboard lighting On the newer keyboards, it's really nice to be able to control them with one hand. If we can get a 7 row keyboard, I would rather brightness buttons to take the space of where ThinkVantage is. Pg Fwd and Bck I know some people really need these while others hate them since they often get hit accidentally. On the Edge 14"", these keys (replaced by  Pg Up/Down, but that's not the point I'm trying to make) are oval shaped and lower rather than regular keys. I don't know why they retracted this. They were really easy to distinguish when I needed them, and have never been accidentally pressed.

Think of the stuff like a mild glue.  In your case you will get your existing CPU with some leftover gunk and some of that gunk on the heatsink. Since you are keeping the heatsink, the leftover gunk is definitely not ideal to protect your shiny new cpu from overheating.

With hardware acceleration enabled I was able to play 4K smoother than 1080p with it disabled (and this is I'm talking about last-generation Intel chip too, so there's no excuse why this generation shouldn't be able to as well).  Also this issue is specific to video playback not 3D graphics (ie games). Games have no issues with these drivers and run exactly at the performance level that they should.

Disassembly is super easy.  As with many classic ThinkPads, the T60 was engineered with serviceability in mind.  Once you have it open, blow some more compressed air from a foot or so away, if it's really dusty.

Also, with regards to Apple using 4:3 on iPads, keep in mind that Apple has a strong presence in the supply chain and can get what they want at reasonable prices.

thinkpad,3dp0nt,Feeshys,2,Sat Jul 18 04:32:37 2015 UTC,All I can really say is use plastic tools to help pry the sucker open(e.g.guitar pick. credit cards are a bit too thick to pry it open with but they can be used to help keep it open while you work around it.) and also be sure to really take your time and not rush. It will take you a while to get the thing open your first time.  The little tabs that help keep the bottom cover attached are VERY fragile so you might end up breaking a couple but don't worry too much if you do. It won't make too much of a difference once you put it back together. If you check out page 62 of the T450s hardware maintenance manual link there is a diagram showing where the tabs are and what order to pry them up in. Hope that helps a bit.
thinkpad,3dp0nt,K_s_K,2,Sat Jul 18 05:07:08 2015 UTC,"As K_s_K mentioned,  there is no way to open it up without breaking a few tabs.

Barely noticable but still annoying when you apply a bit of pressure and you can feel the gap. Whatever you do though make sure you refer to the manual for each step (disable internal battery through the BIOS and remove each screw in the proper sequence as described). Do not refer to any videos you find online other than the official Lenovo maintainance clips. As for the tool I used this one: http://guideimg.alibaba.com/images/shop/79/09/24/9/freeshipping-new-arrival-opening-repair-pry-disassembly-tool-for-cell-phone-laptop_212419.jpg  . Good luck!"

thinkpad,3dngfp,qwerty_face,3,Fri Jul 17 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"dm-crypt is the most reliable way for now with Linuxes. Some file systems are working on built-in encryption, but it's still experimental, and I wouldn't trust self-encrypting drives given the ridiculous state of HDD/SSD firmware security (how the fuck is a drive that allows unsigned firmware updates supposed to keep my data safe?).  However, you're always going to have some bits unencrypted – at the very least the bootloader, and in most cases the kernel too (although the kernel can, with EFIstub, boot directly). Sadly, the only way to somewhat get around this is setting up SecureBoot, even if it isn't exactly trustworthy either…"
thinkpad,3dngfp,Creshal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"Hi,  The last time I looked at this was when I bought my Intel 520 SSD, which like the 850 Evo, has AES encryption by default. I researched a bit back then, and apparently these drives generate internal keys that are used to encrypt the data by default. These keys are unlocked via the hard disk password, also known as the ATA password. The ATA password will be written to the drive's firmware and only when presented with the correct password will the drive unlock itself and decrypt its data.  This is all good in theory, however if you do a bit of research you will find forensic tools available that claim to remove this ATA password. I'm not sure if these work or not - they claim to work on all Samsung drives but not on Intel ones.   So if you want to be 100% safe (read: government safe) I would advise you to use dm-crypt instead. You can look in the Arch Wiki on how to set it up. This works in any Linux computer with any drive, there's nothing stopping it from working on a X220.  If you don't need government level safety and just need prevention against the casual snooper, then you will be OK with the drive's encryption, provided you set a strong password."
thinkpad,3dngfp,bakas1000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"I know that the ATA password on traditional hard drives can be removed, but as far as I know, OPAL and OPAL 2 drives aren't breakable.  Lenovo lets you set a password up to 32 Characters, so that should make it brute-force resistant as well."
thinkpad,3dngfp,zachsandberg,2,Sat Jul 18 04:19:40 2015 UTC,Not so sure about Lenovo's ATA passwords. https://jbeekman.nl/blog/2015/03/lenovo-thinkpad-hdd-password/
thinkpad,3dngfp,becausecomputer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:25:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this man.   The link shows that Lenovo messes up the ATA password algorithm, and it effectively only has a keyspace of 96 bits / 12 characters. On top of this, only alphanumeric, ; and space characters are used, others are discarded.  In practice this means it's a 96 bit keyspace. So my original advice still stands:  1) for anything other than government level security, I think the self encrypting drives using the Lenovo BIOS password are adequate. Use at least a 12 character password with alphanumeric, ; and space. A 12 character password with a SHA256 hash will take years to break on commodity hardware.  2) if you need to hide from the NSA, use dm-crypt with at least 128 bit AES in XTR mode."

thinkpad,3dnvao,softiniodotcom,2,Fri Jul 17 20:11:26 2015 UTC,Would a 4:3 display be best for you? You could go with any of these: X60/X60s/X61/X61s. If you have no preference then an X200/s or X201/s would do just fine or even an X220 although it has a slightly larger display (12.5).
thinkpad,3dnvao,rezusx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to use the X6* today. Performance and battery time is significantly lower than with the X201 that OP already spotted.   The s models are practically impossible to come by and do not offer much of a gain. The 1440x900 panel is theoretically nice but in practice not better since it is still a TN panel.

thinkpad,3dhrbs,Creshal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:56:50 2015 UTC,How does one actually keep a battery from degrading? I've hear about people say to let the battery drain to keeping it plugged in whenever it's not needed.
thinkpad,3dhrbs,GodsDelight,5,Thu Jul 16 14:26:42 2015 UTC,"Sacrificing a goat at midnight using a silver knife on a new moon while chanting ""Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fthaghn!"".  What helps depends on your battery technology (some are better left plugged in, some are better left draining), but it doesn't really matter too much, because the Thinkpad's embedded controller, and the battery's own controller ensure proper operations.  A few things are more or less universal, though:   Less charge = less wear = better Fewer charging cycles = better Less deviation from room temperature = better (i.e., cold = bad, and hot = bad)   So, what you can do:   Set upper and lower charging limits for the battery (with Lenovo's energy manager thingie in Windows and TLP in Linux). A lower upper limit reduces your run time, but helps a bit with reducing the wear. (Although 100% reported aren't the battery's physical limit, the controller already limits the charge.) A lower lower limit means you aren't recharging the battery every time you unplug for five minutes. This is actually the more important setting, as it keeps the battery from recharging needlessly. Keep the temperatures down. Unfortunately, Lenovo's engineers seem to hate batteries, and put them close to the CPU and other fun, heat generating components, especially when using docks or slice batteries. So, if you know your laptop is spending the next 8 hours in the dock at 100% CPU load, you might consider removing the battery. And don't keep the laptop in the sun in summer etc. (Recharging also generates a lot of excess heat, making recharge cycles doubly damaging.)"

I have one and use it for mobile audio entertainment purposes, but when I want to get work done, I use at least a 14"" scree.  I use my T430s.  The T430U is very similar, just a low-power consuming CPU.  The screen, keyboard, and guts are all the same.    I'd go with the larger screen."

PC App Developer: X Series is is not a harm.   *PC/ Console Developer: None of them is good.   Embedded Developer: X series is enough. It will run Keil/ QNX momentics/ other eclipse base IDE/ Debugging is smooth. You can run web browsers and IDE with debuggers with not problems.

In summary: If you want mobility and demo sort of things for your work. Then X series is good. I personally use X240 for development (embedded/ Kernel/ device driver/ UML/ SysML/ Design simulations, etc ). It's light/ small/ long battery and portable to stay safe in my college bag.

The same applies to the T430U. Also (according to the benchmarks) the dedicated 620M isn't much more powerful than the integrated HD4000. Basically the only difference is the dedicated memory.  Personal note: I own an x230 with the 9-cell battery which lasts up to 10h (with WiFi on) with Debian Jessie (and TLP). I love how I don't need to carry an additional bag for it.

They are even better than the dedicated nvidia 620M of the t430u.  So there are some reasons to prefer the new CPUs, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth the extra money."

If you're going to be on the go often, get the 3+6 cell battery (~15 hours on a charge) instead of the standard 3+3 cell battery (~6-8 hours on a charge). 4 GB RAM is enough for most light tasks (web browsing, word processing), 8 GB should be good for most coursework, and 12-20 might be necessary if you're working with multiple VMs or large data sets."

When the RAM is not enough (if you mod a lot) KSP simply crashes to desktop. IMO the bottleneck is the GPU.  Also Chrome is a giant memory hog. Consider switching to Firefox with ublock origin.

Two DIMM slots for 2x8GB, an empty mSATA slot (which can be used for WWAN), and Express Card for PCIe expansion (in my case, a 750 Ti) Out-of-the-box Linux compatibility. Linux is my go-to OS for development, so this is important to me. Smallish size/footprint. It could be better, but for a 2010/2011 laptop, it's pretty good. Wacom + touch is great in Windows (but not so much in Linux). This is ideal for note-taking or digital art. As fast as a modern ultrabook. I'm not losing out on any performance with this old machine. Great keyboard + TrackPoint.   My main issues:   The low-resolution display makes it difficult to fit a lot of text on the screen. It's not the size, it's the resolution, that's the problem. I shrink the text in my IDE so much that if I were to shrink it any more, it'd would become too pixelated to read (and it already has some of those issues--for example, ""="" doesn't actually have a white space between the two black bars but is instead grey because it's trying to put them so close together). If you don't need to fit a lot of lines of code on your screen at once, it won't be an issue for you. 6 hours is under what I would consider ""acceptable"" battery life. I would've liked a 9 cell (96 Wh) battery option. 10 hours is what I think laptop OEMs should aim for as a bare minimum. No USB 3.0, but that's expandable via Express Card.

Throw the SSD in and create an 8gb page file and even photoshop will run well.  Source: I have a T60 with a similar config to your R60 and have no issues running 7 on it.

However, I have a T450S and the keyboard is pretty amazing. Compared to old school keyboards the new keyboard feels more sturdy and since now the keys are segregated it's a bit easier to hit the right keys where as before I always felt the old ThinkPad keyboard was legendary but at times a bit slippery. Key traveling is pretty decent too. The X1's keyboard's travel distance is shorter so it might feel cheap and unpleasant to type on."
thinkpad,3d65hj,HedgeRunner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I had a different type (20BS), but I found the driver update for that type. It didn't seem to fix my problem, but I figured out something a little odd: If I lift up my index finger and click with my thumb on the bottom left (like I was used to doing with the real button), it doesn't work, but if I keep my index finger on the pad and click with my thumb, it does work. Very odd.   And thanks for the input about the t450s keyboard. I might end up switching over to get the better keyboard. The traveling distance is part of why it's annoying, but the most irritating thing is that it doesn't have that discrete, clicky feeling that the old keyboard had that told your fingers that you pushed the key down all the way. With the old keyboards, the key was either all the way up or all the way down, and you could feel it when you type. With this one, there's more of that smooshy middle ground you find on other brands. But hey, I guess something as light and sexy as the X1 can't be perfect."

Touch is optional but I've heard the touch is even dimmer and reports say the Carbon LCD is dim already. The WQHD is made by LG

It might not be brighter than my previous laptop (macbook pro) screen, but it is definitely more readable (the mate finish is great!)

Classic keyboard Thinklight, the concept with two LEDs looks better. Designed to give a slight splash either side as well. Lid latches Decent power processor with either top of the line iris graphics, or decent dedicated gpu. At least 4 hours battery life with heavy use, 12 hours light use. More is better. User replaceable battery, but can be screwed in place. User replaceable SSD RJ45 plug 2 or 3 USB 3.0 plugs and 1 or 2 USB type c plugs (for a total of either 3 or 4 USB plugs) I can still use a 9 pin serial port (i'm not joking) Touch screen Decent webcam   Some further detail in the following;   Island keys can be ok. While classic layout is non-negotiable, whether it uses classic key caps, or island style, I don't really care. I'll lean towards the classic ones, but either is really fine. I would opt against back lighting because the key cap quality gets worse. Some people like backlighting, I think the thinklight is the ideal solution. I'm ambivalent to an Ultrabay. I still use discs every now and then, but not going to be bothered if I need to use an external drive. Would prefer battery life instead. 3:2 seems interesting for an aspect ratio but what I really like about 16:10, especially at 1920x1200 was that it was best of both worlds between 4:3 and 16:9 as it can natively display 1920x1080 content, and 1600x1200 content, with black bars. This tends to work very well with desktop monitors. Going overboard with resolution, might not be the best outcome. Would prefer to have less power consumption from lower demands on GPU and more power efficient display. Trackpad delete. I prefer to use the trackpoint, so if the trackpad is deleted or there, I won't worry too much. SSD doesn't have to be a 2.5"" form factor, probably better to use something like M.2 these days. With a touchscreen, a yoga type hinge might be ok, but not essential. Physical airport mode switch can come in handy (i.e. no wireless communications) Thinkpad black case, rubberised paint, sturdy tank like design. Laptop speakers are rarely any good, but being able to play loudly without distortion can be useful, even though there will never be any bass. Still heaps of old hardware that uses the old style of USB plugs. Can't replace them with the newer type c plug. At least two of the old style plugs I think should be mandatory."

Lenovo's discounts don't tend to vary much when they are done, it's usually the cheap\free bonus item and the model it comes with will vary (the past couple of months it's been the Onelink dock with the E series, now it's the Pro dock with the Ts).  You could wait for Skylake given that apparently there are whispers that'll be launched towards the start of August. If that happens, I'd expect machines shipping towards September\October with Skylake CPUs.

So far with no luck, as sellers who want their listings to match more keywords just throw a whole bunch of different part numbers into the product description. These part numbers may refer to the manufacturer of the board or to the production line, if not to actual specification differences, as the amount of graphic memory. I'd want the top-end GPU I could fit in my current setup, as it's not such a major difference in price. But more importantly, I would want a motherboard that will not be likely to have these graphic issues again, as it now have.

Finally, a quick call to the bank got them to release the spurious fraud alert that the transaction had triggered, and then it went through OK. But not until the Lenovo rep insisted on redoing the transaction at full retail price. What? We'd gotten there from Corporate Perks and had a $500 discount coming our way. They reluctantly put the order in at the original discounted price.  If the site had just had the decency to tell the truth about the transaction - instead of saying ""Transaction Error"", what is so wrong with saying ""We're sorry, the credit card was declined"" - we would have seen that magic ""declined"" word and realized right way to call the bank and get it straightened out.

You can do that with synclient (AreaLeftEdge/AreaRightEdge iirc) or in the xorg config files. That seems to have eliminated most cases of accidentally moving my cursor while typing. The nice thing is that all it does it make it so you can't initiate movement in those regions. If you start a movement in the middle and it continues into those regions, it still works."
