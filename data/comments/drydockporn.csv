She was named after Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, a Prussian general during the reign of King Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War.

Seydlitz featured several incremental improvements over the preceding designs, including a redesigned propulsion system and an improved armor layout.

The ships underwater paint is designed to protect the ship for 60 months, from corrosion but also from marine growth until the cycle is repeated. The thickness of the paint is typically between 300 - 500 micron, depending upon the expected speed and trade of the vessel.  The anchors are lowered so that the chain links can be measured (for wear etc..) and whilst in the dock the chain lockers are inspected, they will also be cleaned, but generally they are pretty clean, as the anchor chain is washed before going back into the chain locker."

Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status.
