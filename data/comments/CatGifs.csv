CatGifs,3cq5oq,JoeyJoJo_Junior,10,Fri Jul 10 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"I know they can eat strawberries, but there's always someone who wants to rain on your happy cat parade."
CatGifs,3cq5oq,TheOldAmanda,5,Fri Jul 10 02:07:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, they can.  But actually wanting to eat strawberries is a sure symptom of a brain aneurysm causing systemic nervous collapse.  Your kitty is slowly losing everything that makes it who it is and will eventually lose the ability to breathe - shortly after forgetting who you are.  And it's really, really painful.  Or possibly that the ears flat are a sign that your cat is afraid for its life.  The strawberry hurts its belly, but deathly scared of you it obediently eats every morsel despite the irreparable damage it's doing.  Not really, it's adorbs."
