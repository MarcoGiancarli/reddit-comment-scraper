pettyrevenge,3e18s2,technofiend,82,Tue Jul 21 04:27:51 2015 UTC,Why did they think it was okay to put their stuff on a table that someone else is sitting at? I don't understand their logic.
pettyrevenge,3e18s2,Bossballoon,64,Tue Jul 21 11:41:00 2015 UTC,"Have you been to second or third world countries where there is a huge divide between classes?  I think people mistakenly assume if they're from some place like that that their behavior at home works every where.   These people were all dressed nicely and in particular the purses were ""expensive"" according to my wife.  I didn't see any Chanel or Louis Vuitton but I assume she knows what she's talking about. Anyway they were speaking Spanish to each other.    So perhaps they acted so poorly because it was assumed we were lower class and that's acceptable at home for them. I didn't ask."

pettyrevenge,3e18s2,belladonnadiorama,8,Tue Jul 21 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"I can't tell the Spanish dialects or accents apart, so it's pure assumption on my part."

I've gotten pretty good at telling if someone speaking Spanish is NOT from Mexico, for sure.   It takes me a little more time to decipher where they are from in Mexico based on how they speak, but I am now able to tell a Northerner vs Southerner vs. DF (Distrito Federal) with more accuracy than before purely because they love to come to my city and shop and I hear the different accents."

pettyrevenge,3e18s2,DeadPrez1,56,Tue Jul 21 07:59:32 2015 UTC,"I used to do this to my sister when shopping; it's a reflex that if someone hands an item to you, you accept it.    It also works phenomenally with things like empty cups when you can't find a trash can.  If you keep up a conversation as you're loading them down like your own personal pack mule, it helps distract them from what you're doing.    On many trips, my sister wouldn't realize she was holding all my stuff until it came time to put it all in the car.    She got wise, eventually, and started noticing when people hand her things to carry."

I've seen more than one group of guys sheepishly carrying out their alcohol from the Groom's room after she was done with them.

We'd still get a couple of parties each year that would try it anyway.   Always busted by the church lady and sent packing.

pettyrevenge,3dvp6e,azimir,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"Yup. In any case, it's a different matter. One case of self-awareness and self-reflection is related to a direct aggression towards the OP. In the case you state, it's just indifference, which can't be that good, but it can't be that bad. I mean, it's not plain aggression. It's just indifference. In places I worked, I would rather have had indifference. And with certain people, I prefer indifference than having to engage in elevator-dialogue. What does it matter to that lad who is not my friend nor have anything in common with me, how was my weekend or what I did for fun? Nah, I leave that to my friends.  Edit: Word.

My team lead thinks he's a good leader because he tries to engage us on a personal level, he just doesn't realize that the only thing he talks about is stuff from his life.  Once he found out I shoot guns and have a modicum of knowledge about cars, that's all he talks about.  It would be one thing if it yielded a conversation, but he just talks AT me so I just placate him until he walks off.  He's not aggressive, just dumb and unfortunately sneaky.  The rumor mill here is off the charts busy so my buddy and I (we basically share the same position) just sit tight and keep out of things so none of the bullshit comes rolling back on us.  These two guys in particular legitimately make my day worse.  They were both off last week and my job was AWESOME."

Also those spots aren't even that great because when you leave there's always pedestrians walking behind your car, other cars backing out to leave (who sometimes just back out and don't even see that you're leaving too) as well as other cars driving behind you or sitting and waiting for you to leave."

Over 10 minutes after getting in my car (had eaten, was on a phone call at that point), someone pulled up and saw my lights on - not my backup lights, just my headlights that automatically turn on. They then proceeded to lay on the horn at me. Then stop and honk some more. And again. I thought someone trying to avoid a car accident in the parking lot before I realized they were honking at me, and I had no intention of leaving since we had another 3 hours left before the fundraiser was over.  What if I was waiting for someone inside the store? What if I was catering to a child? It just pissed me off at how inconsiderate people are."

After the morning class I would sit in my car and eat or browse reddit or whatever and every single day, this jackass would see me sitting in the car, without any lights on or anything indicating I was going to leave, and just sit there and honk his horn for a good ten minutes. Eventually I just took to pretending I couldn't even hear him honking and he would drive away but it always blew my mind. The parking lot was always half empty when this would happen but he just had to have a front space."
pettyrevenge,3dvp6e,theycallmegladdy,19,Mon Jul 20 03:45:24 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot of people expecting someone to be pulling out of a spot and they wait for them so that they can get the spot. I really don't know where this is happening. I've never seen anyone stop and wait for a spot to open up unless the person is already pulling out, reverse lights on. I don't get it. Are parking lots so big in other places that it's basically impossible to walk that far? It doesn't seem like that big of a deal to leave a person alone and find a spot elsewhere. I've never seen someone wait more than ten seconds for a spot. It's just easier to find another one. There's roughly 2 acres of parking spots there."

pettyrevenge,3dvp6e,wkrausmann,8,Mon Jul 20 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends on the amount of car spaces vs volume of shoppers at that particular store / shopping centre.  My local supermarket is next to a primary school so getting a park around drop off & pick up time is very difficult.  Many of the major shopping centres around here (Melbourne, Aust.) also completely suck for parking around holidays, Christmas etc. Following someone back to their car is actually the only way to find a space"

If they don't, I just move on. I can't imagine anyone getting upset over this, it's not like it hurts anyone. ""Oh noes, the pwessure, how do I handle it!?""  OTOH, I actually know people who feel that prime spaces are for people who are shopping or loading only, and that if someone needs to check their phone or fiddle with the radio, they should drive to the far end of the lot to do so.

I've seen it done somewhat often, and only because the car park is full and there are multiple people cruising round looking for a spot. If it looks like someone's going to go, it's perfectly acceptable to wait on them. So someone else doesn't take it."
pettyrevenge,3dvp6e,Joe_Vahkiin,3,Mon Jul 20 11:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying people never wait, but only if the person is already in reverse and pulling out of the spot. Any waiting before that is unnecessary and strange to me. What is the wait time of following someone from the door versus just finding a spot? It could take several minutes to load an entire cart of groceries into the car, and then people say they take their time to bring the cart back, so that's even longer. And besides wasting your own time for a spot, what if someone comes up behind you? Now you're wasting your own time waiting for the spot, making the person about to leave feel like they are holding someone up, AND holding up the person behind you. It just seems silly to me. It might be the small-ish city, but I've never seen a parking lot 100% full. Even holidays and whatnot."
pettyrevenge,3dvp6e,wemlin14,2,Mon Jul 20 11:30:35 2015 UTC,"I very frequently see a 100% full car park, it avoids a lot of frustration if you see someone about to leave and wait for them to go. The alternative is driving around over and over until someone else goes, in which case someone else will just take the spot.  As long as you're polite about it I don't see the problem. I often get asked if I'm about to go by drivers and I have no problem with it. Even if there's a chance driving round will be quicker, there's no guarantee whereas with this option you can comfortably just sit and wait. I'm not sure what gigantic carts take several minutes to unload."
pettyrevenge,3dvp6e,Joe_Vahkiin,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"If the lot is 100% full, maybe you can go elsewhere, park on the street a little further away, or come back later?

Literally have spent 15 minutes driving around not finding a spot anywhere, even on the complete opposite side of the mall from where I wanted to be. In those circumstances, it can make sense.  If the lot isn't incredibly close to or completely full, though, it is ridiculous to follow someone to their car and wait for them."
pettyrevenge,3dvp6e,Species7,-5,Mon Jul 20 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"I think it would be good if a short honk to let the original spot owner knows someone is waiting and if they are not leaving, wave the hand  so the waiting car can go and look for other spot"

pettyrevenge,3dtpc9,itsableeder,4,Sun Jul 19 23:33:26 2015 UTC,The European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires’ Disease recommend that hot water should be stored at 60 °C (140 °F) and distributed such that a temperature of at least 50 °C (122 °F) and preferably 55 °C (131 °F) is achieved within one minute at points of use.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_heating#Bacterial_contamination
pettyrevenge,3dtpc9,HittingSmoke,0,Mon Jul 20 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"They're European guidelines, not UK laws. Plenty of premises here use electric immersion heaters which are switched on when hot water is needed. I don't know exactly how much heat they retain, but mine only gets switched on maybe twice a week. I can't imagine that it's staying above 60°C for that amount of time, yet there is no law that requires me to make sure the water stays above that temperature and no safeguards in place to make sure the temperature doesn't drop. We also have electric kettles in nearly every house; everybody knows that you should empty the water between uses, but nobody does, and I've never heard of anybody becoming ill from reusing the water in a kettle.  Just to clarify, I'm not refuting any claims that it's potentially harmful to deal with hot water in this way. I'm refuting this comment;   Turning the water heater down below 120 is likely illegal   And the ensuing downvotes to /u/FievelGrowsUp, who says quite rightly that that specific statement is likely incorrect, given that OP clearly isn't in the USA."
pettyrevenge,3dtpc9,itsableeder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:06 2015 UTC,"Saying something is likely illegal != saying something is definitely illegal.

And if for some reason I don't have a bowl, I only have the shower trickling enough that I can rinse my razor with it. And yea, I did this when my parents were paying all the bills too. Also, if you're showering regularly, it doesn't take at all long to get clean."
pettyrevenge,3dtpc9,Compiche,5,Sun Jul 19 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"I can get completely clean in 10 minutes, maybe five more if I need to shave my legs. (Admittedly, I do not need to comb through my hair when I condition it, that might take awhile if your hair is long or thick, mine is medium length and dabbing the conditioner in, rubbing it down to the end and rinsing leaves it nearly tangle free.)  That said, when I take a 40 minute shower, it's not to jack off, it's because I have back issues and the hot water spray feels amazing on the soreness. I support long ass showers, but I take mine when I know my housemate won't need hot water for awhile. Even if you WERE jacking off though, why is it her business?

Source: Frequently go to outdoor festivals hosted by the same crew. The guy who provides showers for everyone working is an Army drill instructor and treats us like recruits when we take showers.

A bath is a heap of energy down the drain too, though. If we assume a flow rate from the shower head of 2 gallons/min, that's 80 gallons of usage to a bath's ~60.

pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,soingee,89,Sat Jul 18 16:51:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like your last paragraph is a little wrong. It's completely wrong for Walter to be weird and creepy like that. But as a server and server trainer at a restaurant just like this one, that's what the last day is. You stand and observe your trainee but they do everything. They take the order, they punch it into the computer, they get drinks and run the food.   The only reason the trainer is still there and not taking other tables is to answer any questions the trainee doesn't know yet.  Edit: also trainees don't get tips because they are making whatever minimum wage is in that area, where as the trainer is making the 2.13 an hour or whatever the living wage in that area is."
pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,mommy2libras,105,Sat Jul 18 13:10:35 2015 UTC,"We checked with the manager when we asked him to change it, she was a trainee ... last week.

pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,Barteringram,22,Sat Jul 18 15:28:31 2015 UTC,No servers share a two top unless they're training.
pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,not_drunk_on_love,58,Sat Jul 18 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"Chilis does. They moved to ""shared sections"" a few years ago. Which means there are like 4-5 tables that the waiters split tips. The manager probably paired the two of them together because she was his trainee."
pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,Macdirmot,9,Sat Jul 18 16:05:33 2015 UTC,So what's the point of trying to take over a table if you split it all in the end anyway?
pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,mimid316,27,Sat Jul 18 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"So you can say you visited it.  The point of sharing sections is so that (theoretically) customers always have a server available. If you're running food or taking an order at one table, your section buddy can refill drinks or greet people or whatever and you do the same for them. All tables belong to the both of you. And people get protective of their money. So some might say ""yeah but I did everything for those tables myself so I'm not splitting"" . This way the other person can say, ""no, didn't you see me over there with them?"" and also have witnesses that they did.  Waiting tables can be like high school, depending on who you work with and what management lets go on."

pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,Ringbearer31,11,Sat Jul 18 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that this is within a pay period, not per day. If training only lasts one week out of a two week pay period, it's assumed that the server will make enough during the second week to compensate for being tipped at all the first week. Servers often make way less than minimum wage on a per day basis, but they always come out ahead on average, and that's what the government cares about."

pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,Ringbearer31,8,Sat Jul 18 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"Most of us who have worked as servers can tell you if you are the one to go to the feds about not getting the minimum, you will find yourself getting minimum hours as payback.  A lot of illegal shit goes on in restaurants.  A law is only as good as the enforcement of said law, and since a lot of states have 'at will' employment you can be fired for anything, or nothing at all."
pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,magus424,2,Sat Jul 18 20:21:48 2015 UTC,To me this is one of these treble damages sort of situations. First you would get triple what they owed you. Then if they made any material changes to your working conditions its triple damages time again.  There should also be no limit going back. Thus some screwed employee with 8 years of good records would be able to basically retire.

pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,DothanSchmothan,4,Sat Jul 18 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right about employers having to make sure that if tips don't cover minimum wage, the employer makes up the difference. Not all establishments take it as seriously as you do though. I once worked as a hostess at a well known Aussie themed steakhouse for a few months in college. I made $2.13/hr plus tipshare and if the tipshare didn't bring that $2.13 up to minimum wage the company was supposed to supplement the rest. Right around the time I quit a busboy had come in one day all upset about his paychecks being ""short"", so I decided to go back through and check mine before I got my final paycheck, just in case (all of which I had luckily kept).  Well waddayaknow, 7 of my 10 paychecks I had been paid below minimum wage. 70% isn't an accident. It's purposefully, systematically, shorting your employees. I calculated what they owed me and went in on my last day and showed them my meticulous calculations. I told them they could pay me the $70+ they owed me with my last paycheck that was still coming, or I could report them.   I got that extra money. And I made sure to tell every single busboy and hostess I saw on my way out to check their paychecks and make sure we weren't all being screwed over en masse. I've had a bad taste in my mouth for the place ever since. They knew what they were doing. They just kept doing it because they hadn't been called out on it yet."

Fun fact: it's illegal to make the tip credit wages if you're not making enough tips to bring you over minimum wage, so it shouldn't really matter who gets the tips."
pettyrevenge,3dq1fi,DorkJedi,10,Sat Jul 18 18:57:18 2015 UTC,The trainee is not making a server's min wage if they are not making tips. They are making the min wage for the state they are in. Once you receive tips you drop back down to server rate.

I believe in your case you were completely in the right. Trainees do not get tips, its a judgement to see if they can do the job, if they do sometimes the trainer will slide the trainee part of the bank. But typically trainees will get free meals the first week, and they get to learn a lot about how to treat guests.   I just want to point out some things you may not be aware of:   Typically trainees are forced upon seasoned servers(they need to make money too)  Sometimes a seasoned server will have to train repeatedly for shifts( meaning that if you give some of your money to a trainee everyday for a week, you're not paying rent this month). Training is f-ing hard! You talk your entire shift, imparting your well earned knowledge.  Every single table minus a FEW will leave extra for a ""good trainee""    You are completely in the right, the waiter should have acknowledged both of you, introduced himself with the trainee, instead of behind her back (that's just stupid), and if she was already taking orders not asked if you ""needed anything else"". However if she didn't asked, its the trainers responsibility to ask.   Source: 10 years being a waitress at dive bars to the ritziest of places, and begrudgingly always F-ING training"

I've worked at some where you're not allowed to get tips because you're being paid an actual wage instead of 2.13 or whatever it is, some where you split with your trainee and some where you actually have your own tables and are just kind of shadowed by your trainer and get to keep your tips.  I also hate when the person training you assumes you're an idiot and doesn't come out and say it but implies it to the customers. ""Oh, she's new, just a trainee"". Bitch please.

I drive old cars. In our area most people have money and drive BMWs and other such luxury cars that are usually no more than a few years old. So her rates are great for those types of cars. At first she had trouble quoting me at all because whatever insurance company she goes through isnt interested in low cost plans/coverage. When she did run the quote through it came back a lot higher (like close to double) what Im already paying.   I am not the norm however so it is understandable.

They told me that was the best deal they could do and they couldn't lower it so I said ok and hung up  and immediately called the second company. who gave me a quote of $90 a month. So I called back the other insurance company informed them I would be cancelling it and when they asked me why I told them another company offered me $90 a month to which they replied oh well we can give you 85 I told them to shove it and that they lied to me once why would I go with a liar company.

pettyrevenge,3d96oi,WhatDidYouSayToMe,14,Tue Jul 14 21:46:26 2015 UTC,"Can you get a tuner on your car? I have a ""Whisper Mode"" tune on my truck that drops the idle and makes it relatively quiet. It smells worse, but works great while talking to the people at the microphone and window."
pettyrevenge,3d96oi,Deathwagon,12,Tue Jul 14 22:27:19 2015 UTC,Wow I actually have never heard of that. It sounds like a cool idea and I'm gonna look into it though. Thanks!
pettyrevenge,3d96oi,WhatDidYouSayToMe,3,Tue Jul 14 18:25:56 2015 UTC,"No problem. They're quite common on trucks, but you may be able to find one for your merc."
pettyrevenge,3d96oi,Deathwagon,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:53 2015 UTC,I have a diesel with a 4 inch straight pipe from the turbo back.  I have to turn it off between talking and moving so I can hear.  I usually turn it off after almost every time I move so I don't disrupt everyone trying to order.  Actually recently I've just been getting out and going inside because it's such a pain in the ass.
pettyrevenge,3d96oi,WhatDidYouSayToMe,2,Tue Jul 14 23:35:20 2015 UTC,"Dude, get a tuner with whisper mode; your motor will thank you. Not sure how loud your truck actually is, but I know it can't be good for it to turn it off and on again that frequently.  My friend shuts his 7.3 off, but I avoid it whenever possible. I've actually idled the truck overnight so I had AC when I slept and it seemed happier than turning it off."
pettyrevenge,3d96oi,Ihavenootheroptions,2,Wed Jul 15 03:01:03 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, it's in the near future but financially doesn't make sense right now.  (I just bought a new injection pump last week for it... Ouch!)  I really don't go through drive thrus more than once a month, and recently haven't at all.    Not sure which tuners come with a whisper mode for the 5.9 cummins though.  Most of the ones i've looked at don't mention it as an option.  I really like my buddies DP Tuner for his 7.3, but they don't make anything for the Cummins.  It seems most guys get the edge comps or smarty's  It sounds really good, but is incredibly loud from outside.  It's much louder than most trucks I've heard before."

If I'm not being paid for my time, I'm not spending that time doing what my employer wants me to do, simply put.  When I worked retail, at one job, we were required to do a complete drawer count before ringing up our first customer. I had no problem with that until the boss started expecting us to show up fifteen minutes early so that we could just ""count it with the person you're relieving"". That, in and of itself, wasn't a problem, but if I start at 2, and now you want me here at 145, you need to plan on paying me for that time.  Eventually I told him I could either get paid an extra fifteen minutes, or show up on time and count my till after 2...but he had to pick one.  He threatened to fire me, I mentioned that HR would probably love to hear about a supervisor making threats to employees, and he shut up about it. With me.  The first time I worked a morning and my fill in showed up fifteen early, I said nothing to him, but shot an email to HR.  He wasn't fired, but a few weeks later he was transferred."

It's common practice where I work to show up 10 minutes before your shift. I started clocking in 10 minutes early everyday and my supervisor got mad because I was collecting over time. I told him I could get paid for the 10 minutes or I could come directly on time take your pick. So now I'm getting paid an extra 10 min a day. It's almost required to come in early for debriefing before your shift.

I work up until the overnight shift comes in. Our store is desperate for overnight workers, hell last year management was upset that one of the overnight girls left to go to rehab. We have one good overnight girl who will typically arrive right on the button or a couple of minutes late, we like her because she tries. The only times she's been late is when she had car troubles and asked the other person working for a ride.  The one who left for rehab had a history of giving away free groceries and selling meth. We don't always strike gold with overnights, but as I said: management is desperate.  I have stayed 40 minutes after I was supposed to be done, and another supervisor stayed for 2 hours (in this case both overnights did not show or pick up their phones, and the other ones didn't want to come in) until calling the owners son and requesting that he come to the store to help him close it down because he he was exhausted. 15-20 minutes is more typical, but I extended it because there are times where one is a no-call no-show or hours late.  Management isn't the greatest as its a family business and they'll throw the younger employees under the bus if it'll make customers happy. But for the older women they'll just sweep it to the side and not care, which is bullshit.  Edit: We've reported this multiple times and have written the overnight workers up.

Starting with the chapter on health & safety usually has a LOT of rules: two person rule when one is on a ladder (the other holds the base), full personal protective gear required when cleaning up anything that might be vaguely toxic, required posting of MSDS sheets for everything, wet floor procedures (one person guards the spot so customers don't fall, another walks carefully to get the wet floor sign, another goes to get a mop and bucket), deli slicer rules, etc.  You can probably waste 1/2 a shift doing everything policy requires. And you have the manual to back you up.   This works best if everybody (or at least a majority) of people on a shift do it. If you're going to do this alone, do it incrementally over time."

It's fine, understandable; none of us are getting paid so we should respect each other's time and not make people wait on us.  But the group leader for my night started slowly inching the time we needed to be there earlier and earlier. It started with, ""be there at 6:29 or you're counted as late!"" But then slowly she'd begin making comments like, ""oh, soandso isn't here yet - they're late!"" when it was only 6:27-28. At one point one girl walked up with a cup of water at 6:22 and the leader said, ""You can't have food or drinks in the conference room [checking watch] so you only have three minutes to finish that."" Like...no.  We are all volunteers and I swear the people in charge demand of us like we're getting paid. Plus they act like so much of what we do is SUCH a privilege.

But honestly, if a human just went around ripping your shit to shreds, you would probably do something about the human too.

Of course, my room mates cat is pretty determined, even after my roomie got his front paws declawed, bastard just switched to his back paws. We gave up lol."

pettyrevenge,3d5hdy,mittensquish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:48:15 2015 UTC,"They did. We still have several around too. The cat only likes to scratch things that humans want it not to scratch / seem to have an attachment to.  ie. if someone is protective of something, 99% chance the cat will try to destroy it, even with only his back claws. Luckily he usually can't get the leverage to do much damage with the back ones."
pettyrevenge,3d5hdy,Qaeta,2,Tue Jul 14 15:53:26 2015 UTC,we use a cardboard scratching post for my cat. because after she takes a shit she likes to run as fast as she possibly can up the stairs and viciously scratch up the carpet at the top of the stairs. we tried a carpet type scratching post but she would scratch around it but she LOVES the card board kind. like this. https://planetpowers.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/scratch.jpg

I managed to lose my ID that had my new married name on it. I did have an old ID that had my maiden name so I just took that one. I get to a bar and they are eyeballing the ID ( I look really young for my age). They start by asking what my address is, I get it wrong since I have moved half a dozen times in the last 2 years. The best part was the bouncer tried to give me a break and asked my name.... I gave him the wrong name... Since I was married and had changed my name I didn't even think about the fact it had my maiden name on it. So yeah the bouncer just laughed at me and sent me away.

My younger uncle had been bragging about how awesome his new fake ID is.

My uncles show up to this bar and my younger uncle instantly gets his new (expensive) fake ID confiscated by the door guy.  He had only had it about 24 hours total.  The really funny part is they were in a college town that was a lot more lenient than today, so you only had to be 19 to get in and drink at this bar.

Maybe there's some stupid law that says he can't sell it to you until 9 a.m. ATF doesn't care for a bar, but they do for liquor stores. Or maybe your California Lisette was fishy to him. ATF will use out of state fakes so every bartender, server and bouncer is warned to look at out of state lisette's extra careful. Of course in central florida 60% of people are out of states because of the theme parks so we have to extra check them all. Out of state, tonight is your birthday, he probably just refused in case you were ATF. Or he was an idiot. Not making excuses, just offering a reason why he turned you down."

To make sure that the people that work there are actually looking at licenses and not just asking for it, glancing, and flipping it back to them and saying ""cool"".  It's not a sting, it's a... an all encompassing test. They're not targeting one liquor store, they're doing this at all liquor stores (and bars) during the weekend (it usually goes for a whole weekend). It's not uncommon for bartenders to get an ATF text and yell to all other bartenders in the establishment ""ATF IS OUT"". Then for the rest of the weekend any bar you go into, they'll be griping about how ATF is out and they have to check everyone and grumble grumble grumble.   They're not going to have kids with legit lisences go in. They'll have shitty fakes or fakes from other states sometimes, to make sure that we're up on spotting fakes (most hospitality industry jobs around here have a class you take twice a year that teaches you alcohol safety and how to spot fakes and hammers in what happens to them and you if you're caught by ATF serving underage kids). My friend got caught two years ago. They got past the bouncer, so she thought they were cool. They were not. She was arrested, HUGE fine. Bar got an equally huge fine. She was fired, and because everyone talks about it, she couldn't get another job serving for a bit. It was a fucked up time.  Sorry for the wall of text. I'm rambling."

One of the things these cops do from time to time is they'll send underage kids into stores to buy alcohol/cigarettes to see if the store actually cards them. If they don't, the employee gets charged with contributing, and the store can receive anything from a hefty fine up to losing their license to sell alcohol. The one store I worked at for a short period of time told us that if the customer looked under the age of 44 to card them. Smfh."

So even though you were of age in the first situation, even the slightest chance of the idea of selling booze to someone on their 21st birthday lets the guy rather say no to the sale than take the risk of being penalized.  Is it possible that this wasn't at all personal but just a error in caution?"

Sitting next to my brother was a stack of about 7 coasters, and he thought it would be funny to throw them at me frisbee style. After telling him to stop multiple times, I became increasingly irritated with the harmless attacks. Once he had thrown all the coasters with a satisfactory 'what are you going to do about it' look, I sat in defeat thinking about how I might top his annoyance. I picked only one of the coasters(to limit his supply) and chucked it straight at him like a ninja star. I had underestimated my strength and accuracy, and it hit him straight down the middle of his nose. He went down in pain. I had only wanted to annoy him, but my luck was greater than that.   For the next week or two there was a vertical, bright red cut straight down the bridge of his nose. Whenever we made eye contact, I simply took my hand and motioned the coaster coming into contact with his nose as a 'remember what happened when you messed with me' message."

A roommate of mine, at 18 years of age, didnt flush nine out of ten times he'd taken a shit. Shared bathroom, so of course I get somewhat disturbed when I'm greeted by a big pile of shit everytime I enter the bathroom. So I talk to him, come on man you gotta flush, this is nasty. We share the bathroom so come on, have a little courtesy for me aswell. Yea I'll try to remember it he says. I sigh and go back to my room. Later that evening I go to the bathroom to get ready for bed and I am once again greeted by a big pile of his awful diet stinking shit. I've talked to the guy so many times now and I just got so fed up with it.   So I took his toothbrush, and just sort of pushed the head on his pile of shit hard enough to move it but not so it visibly stains the brush top. The next morning I wake up to the sound of a running shower, and I just lay there and wait. Then I hear it, the sink is running, and then the brushing sound. And I smile. Oh how I smiled there in my bed. Everytime, and this was a daily occurence, he didnt flush I simply used his toothbrush to push around a bit then put it back and flush. I stopped asking him to flush and had the best mornings of my life with pure joy everytime I heard the brushing sound for about eight months. Let that be a lesson to you non flushers out there, you never know where your shit might end up if you dont take care of it."

pettyrevenge,3cw5ki,Ambiwlans,7,Sun Jul 12 01:23:48 2015 UTC,"Putting a bike  anywhere but the front is definitely more of a hassle but if you're able bodied it's a minor inconvenience at worst. Removing zip ties and holding up the bus, not so minor.   There's no rule that says first off gets first spot. Where I live the drivers actually recommend the first person to load their bike to put it in the front so that the depth of the rack is visible to others."
pettyrevenge,3cw5ki,Xaxxon,4,Sat Jul 11 13:57:08 2015 UTC,There's no rule that says first off gets first spot   Another very valid point. There is absolutely no reason those spots shouldn't be first come first serve.

Understandably, servers try to give away their sections to get out of it. This is okay, provided they have manager approval (things like hours, server skill, when there next shift is all come into play in that decision).  One idiot server decided to have someone else greet her sections, and THEN try to tell me she got no tables in a sold out movie.  She thought I would let it go because the damage was already done. Nope. I transfered her all the tables and let the other server (the one she'd  tried to screw over) leave. She stayed until 2:30am, whereas if she had just followed procedure she would've gotten cut at like 11:30pm. She learned not to lie to me."

I'm 6'5"", 250 so I'm usually the winner in those situations if I'm exiting (I stand, wait, shrug and then walk through them if they don't move)... but one time at Queensboro Plaza during rush hour, I was in a very full train just off the side of the door, squeezing as much as I could toward the seat bars. When the doors opened, some little douche attempted to get on before anyone got off (About 30 people were exiting my door alone). Of course he had nowhere to go, so his recourse was to try and push through my arm as I shouted at him twice, ""People are getting off. People are getting off!""  Since he didn't listen, I took the elbow that was already at his chest and whipped it backward. If there hadn't been people behind him on the platform, he would have laid out. It worked, though, everyone had the chance to get off. When he finally got on, he started to give me shit when another rider got in his face and started shouting at him about the rules of the subway, and next time he'd better get his ass out of the way when people are exiting the train. I never even had to respond to the douche. It was glorious."
pettyrevenge,3cshnc,cttime,16,Fri Jul 10 20:46:05 2015 UTC,I love when the people on the outside rush to be an inch in front of the center of the door. Meanwhile I'm standing an inch from the center of the door on the inside and walk straight into them when it opens.

When the elevator opens and 3 people try to get on before I get off, it sends me into a fury. If I can get away with it, I'll make myself as wide as possible, making sure to bar anyone's entrance, and get off as slowly as possible. If I time it right, I can block people from entering the elevator as I exit, and as soon as I step out, the doors close behind me. For those that were inconvenienced, they usually only need to walk over and push the button again and the same elevator will open up because it hasn't gone anywhere yet, but it's quite satisfying to inconvenience them, if even only for a few seconds."

One time, the train was packed, standing room only, not even breathing room, just standing. Woman with shopping bag standing in the doorway, I brushed against her bag getting on and apologized. Next stop, I get out, brushing against her bag, to let others deboard, and I apologized. I get back on brushing against her and her bag, apologize. Next stop same thing.  About the same numbers are getting on as are getting off so the train is still packed. Two more stops, I have no choice but to brush against her or her bag or both as I move out of the way to let others through. I finally stopped apologizing and she quipped that it was rude to brush someone to the side just so you can get on the train.  I asked her if it was also rude to stand in an open door when people are trying to get in and out.  She didn't say a word and finally got out at our fifth stop together."

Every dog I've ever lived with (they were my parent's dogs mind you) ate poop. Their own poop, other dog's poop, geese poop. They like the scent of poop enough to even roll about in it. We're talking I've had 8 different breeds including a mutt and one of those designer corgi/dalmatian mix dogs all of them ate poop. So those dogs literally will not care.  Alternatively if OP catches the dogs alone he/she could rub the poop all over the dogs especially on the feet/bellies. The dogs will actually enjoy it. Once done the dogs will happily prance into the house sit on and rub against EVERYTHING if there as spoiled as OP says and the owners will have to wash the poop of them and everything they touch. This requires becoming friends with the dogs though so they don't snap at you when you do that."

pettyrevenge,3clcg9,lewarcher,12,Thu Jul 9 07:51:08 2015 UTC,"Good luck. Keep on her in person for the rent on a daily basis, and follow up with email, recapping your conversations. In the end, if she still doesn't pay, threaten her with small claims court, and use your email chain as evidence.  Ensure you have tallied her rent and explained it to her clearly in emails as well. Stop using texts, and be more formal with her until this is resolved.  Basically, it's your money, and she is preventing you from accessing it. PM me if you need any help with wording, etc. I've been fortunate to eliminate people like her from my life, and I wish you didn't have to deal with her. But you have to."
pettyrevenge,3clcg9,XarabidopsisX,5,Thu Jul 9 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"This is the best advice. Especially if she is on the lease, you can prove that she owes a share of rent. Check your records for when she moved in. If you have it in writing how much she agreed to pay each month, you can use that against her. If she ever actually paid anything, you can use that against her too, to show she was aware and in agreement with the arrangement."

Before anybody asks, this was in the early 90's, before email was a thing.     So anyway, I'm on my route, heading to one of the offices.  There was a long hallway that was all windows on one side.  My friend who was the night operator, Edith, called a Code Rainbow.  Just as I hear her do that, I look out one of the windows and see this dude, buck ass naked, running balls to the wall and hell bent for leather away from the hospital.     It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where our special snowflake had went.     So I call Edith and tell her where I saw him at and how he was ""dressed"".  She laughed and said she'd let security know.  About 30 seconds later, security went zooming past, on the move after our boy.  I heard a day later they had gotten him and brought him home."

pettyrevenge,3cex1u,initialZEN,3,Thu Jul 9 04:42:03 2015 UTC,It's definitely something that is taught. I first ran into it at basement parties in college where it's sort of the weird animal behavior of the group. Girls go out and dance in groups and the bros come up behind them and pull them off.

Before glycol units there were units called temprites, but they use a lot of refrigerant to charge up and if they get a leak it can be expensive.

Our bedroom is on the front facing wall, so I guessed someone had puked on our doorstep again. I quickly realised I could actually hear the sound of something wet and splattery.  Realising someone was probably throwing up on our door, I ran upstairs to confront the individual. I opened the door, and saw the guy 2 yards in front of me puking all over my front step. He was surrounded by three of his mates who were looking after him.  I asked one of his mates to move him along, at which point the guy started heaving again. His mate said ""That's it Dave, get it all out.""  I asked him to turn around and get it all out on the road behind him, to which his mate said, ""Don't worry mate, I'll clean it up... I'll clean it up."" I pointed out that he wouldn't clean it up, and asked him to just turn his mate around to face the road instead of puking on my house.  His mates finally obliged and pointed Mr Pukey into the road - all of them giving me dirty looks, like I was being so unsympathetic to this obviously very ill individual.  Camden Town can be a testing place to live."

Tourists come in the day for Camden Market and leave much less of a footprint than the pukers. Camden Town early on Sunday morning is eerily similar to the beginning of 28 Days Later; rubbish everywhere and too many biohazards to count.

Except that he was an infant and a few of the clothes had stains on them that I couldn't get out.

Which means several kids have worn these clothes, shat in these clothes, dirtied up these clothes and despite what these tv commercials with fuzzy bears and happy soccer moms want to tell you, not all those stains come out. So now you've got a heap of stained, faded, worn out clothing that you think of as a gold mine and I can bet that new mom is just going to throw most out.

Who cares if it's only worn around the house, but since clean, unstained onesies are so cheap in consignment, why would you waste drawer space on lots of old and stained onesies?"

Second hand baby clothes are utterly fantastic, and if you care that they're maybe a little faded because they're on their 5th baby, you're worrying about stupid shit.

Sure, you can see that they aren't brand new, and you can see that they're from the 80ies (which only makes them cooler!), but the babies don't care. All in all, the individual pieces have probably been worn for a year or two tops, so they're still in pretty good shape. To my sister and me, these hand-me-downs are priceless.

Nope, just starving. My mom had a lot of good qualities... cooking and understanding that allergies don't always mean immediate death weren't two of them.)

It gets kinda tricky, because their mother has them on a restrictive diet (because she's on it to lose weight, they have to be, apparently), and his father and I try to make up for it by letting them have things they normally don't get, like pasta or chips. But treats and snacks are privileges, and they still have to eat what was made for them first, you know? What they're willing to eat changes day to day--they're kids, they're going to push boundaries.

pettyrevenge,3c82o8,iibnf,-4,Mon Jul 6 08:27:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, that's not cool. They shouldn't have to go on a diet because there mother is. They are GROWING. They don't need less variety. That's just unfair to them.  Edit here: didn't understand this part, my bad.  Also, in their future, don't force food on them but instead let them know it's the right thing to try it and encourage them to try it. If they don't like it, that's cool, just figure out something which can replace the nutrient that food was giving them. And when they're old enough to cook, which may very well be now, have them help you cook! So that if they do want something else later on in life, they can make a dinner together or whatnot. Basically, give them the choice, but a multiple choice kind of way. Being an absolute authoritarian isn't always the best way to go when it comes to food or anything else anyhow. Coming from a divorced family, it definitely doesn't help to be dictatorial. Let them make choices and if it's the wrong choice calmly, I repeat, calmly, teach them why it was wrong and what to do later. Give them opportunities to learn and have fun with you.   And if you want them to do something, do not EVER say that they have to because you said so. That's the most bullshit reason a parent can come up. It leaves no room for discussion and is ignorant. Give them a reason anytime they ask why,  it gives them an idea of why something should be done. And later, when you ask them to do something, they may or may not ask why, but they know that you have a legitimate reason behind what you're asking and will know it's not just busy work or what have you.  In essence, be a dependable person to these children. If you make a promise. Keep it. Shouldn't be making promises you can't keep anyways. Be a teacher, but a teacher which shows love for their children always. I repeat though DO NOT be an authoritarian. That is just plainly wrongful."

Golly, they sure do love those frozen burritos, ask for them all the time. And strawberry popsicles! And chips, and macaroons, and dark chocolate. One kid just gorges on fruit all day if we don't monitor how much he's taking out of the refrigerator. But an entire Albertson's fruit bowl in one half-hour sitting is surely not that bad, amiright?  I should just let them have everything they want and not expect them to eat the food I cook. I should ignore their dad telling me not to let them walk all over me, and aside from medical and major decisions, to treat them as if they were my own. In fact, I should talk to their dad again, and let him know that me providing anything other than ""THIS IS THE FUN HOUSE AND ONLY YOUR DAD MAKES THE RULES"" is going to damage then irreparably. I should not set the precedent now, so their new half-brother I birthed (I'm a step-mom, by the way :D) is on equal footing when it comes to the rules of the house. In fact, we should just do away with the lesson of ""rules of the house you're visiting,"" because fuck, it would traumatize them to do otherwise! They're just so delicate and precious! They must have leeway to do whatever they want, like call Aunt Molly ""lazy"" for not changing a video for them because she's nursing their cousin. Yup, just can't dissent at all, I'm merely the stepmother who gets up to feed them, entertain them, include them in family activities, and provide some semblance of structure that doesn't involve the ass-beating their stepdad gives when they don't listen. Or maybe I should just wind up  my beating hand? Please, tell me.  Oh, I suppose I should also not have smacked one in the mouth after he bit me during a tantrum. I mean, he doesn't bite anymore, but that clearly traumatized him for life. It's a wonder they still say ""I love you redpandabear"" or ask for hugs and kisses at night. Just truly astounding!  TL;DR: In absolute seriousness, all four parents, bio and step, are in agreement that stepparents are to be listened to. Their mother has scolded them for not listening to me before. Even though she and I don't get along, we've both expressed appreciation for putting the kids first and working well enough together that going to either Mom or Dad's during trade-offs hasn't been the meltdown it used to be before either stepparent was in the picture. If and when the therapist the one is about to see says we're doing it wrong, I may be inclined to listen. As it is, this is the mutual agreement amongst all adults involved.  TL;DR of TL;DR: I am not their friend, I am their stepmother, and I work within the boundaries set by both parents.  P.S. They're freaking Otter Pops, dude. Nothing even remotely nutritious about them, and nothing they ever used to have stocked in the house. Treats are a privilege, not a tool to coax them out of meltdowns."

Oh, and it's between $12 and $20 around here depending where  you go and whether you paid for 3D or IMAX, and if you're a family of four, well, with popcorn and drinks you're looking at over $120. More if you had to pay for transportation or parking.   So, for a small family without a big income, going out to a movie is a BIG TREAT that they spent a lot of money on, and they do not need some drama queen deciding to throw a tantrum and ruin their night out because he felt like bothering everyone else with his revenge against someone who said something mildly rude."

I am too stupid to figure out how much things cost, and my statement of $10 clearly shows I don't intend to ruin an expensive 3D movie for anyone.

When I was a teenager we had gone to see one of the Harry Potter films and it was so packed my friends didn't get to sit together. I sat with one friend next to this older woman and during the trailers, we get really excited about this movie we had seen (mostly the two of us agreeing to go see it) and the lady beside me hushes us. We quiet down and the movie starts.   Early in to the film said old lady reaches for her large coke she's put in the cup holder on our shared arm rest and she knocks the whole thing on my light denim jeans, ice and all. This is mid movie and I'm sitting there cold and gross but I refuse to miss the movie. However, during quiet moments I'd occasionally find an ice cube on my lap and flick it off of me, reminding her every few minutes about what she had done. The clatter of ice had her stiffen up each time and it was so satisfying.  In retrospect what I did was probably disruptive to other people, but I was cold and wet and mad and a teenager."

The US is the largest military power in the world and from what I read on reddit seems to have an over-active police force. Taking these factors into consideration there seems to be something wrong for citizens still to live in such fear, particularly if it is because the crime and threat rate is higher.

Of course, there is also the fact that we humans are pretty poor at accurately judging risk (even when we are certain that we are good at doing so).

If you're texting at a red light and someone gives you a courtesy beep, that would make you the asshole.  Obviously I'm talking in hypotheticals here. I can understand an impatient driver, but there are ways of going about hurrying through traffic that don't inconvenience others. Yeah, get in front of slow people, but only when you have room to do so. Speed all you want, but do it when you're in front of traffic, not behind it.  I was a really slow driver for years, because before I even got my learner's, by dad pressured me into driving when I wasn't comfortable and I ended up hitting a parked car (narrow street with two-way street parking - oncoming car made me panic and sideswipe a minivan... keep in mind I was doing this in an old jeep grand wagoneer, not a nice narrow corolla or something). As a result I would always go like 5 under, or maybe match the speed limit out of fear. Now I like to go as fast as the road allows, but I totally understand why other people might not want to."

pettyrevenge,3c642d,Jupichan,-15,Mon Jul 6 06:47:20 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you were driving too slow because of your inexperience driving, and then decided that someone wanting to go the speed limit was a dick so you went slower.  I'm sure you aren't going to get ripped out of your car and stomped at any point, so keep it up.  Everyone loves a dick who thinks they are in the right.  As a friendly reminder, although I don't know where you live, the laws regarding driving are there to create a safe and harmonious time on the road.  If you are driving slower than the speed limit and someone is encroaching on your space, pull over and let them pass, or enjoy the headlights in your rear view.  You are entirely at fault and a bad driver to boot.  If you can't drive the speed limit at night than don't drive at night.  There are a lot of people willing to run you off the road for that behavior, so you are taking your chances."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,13,Sun Jul 5 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"If someone is driving below the speed limit on a perfectly bright, calm, sunny day, I get annoyed. If it's night time and raining its perfectly within reason to drive below the speed limit."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,sosthaboss,25,Sun Jul 5 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"It's a speed limit. Meaning your maximum allowed speed, not a speed minimum. If your mad at someone driving a little under the speed limit in unsafe conditions, then you are the asshole in the wrong."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,Ihavenootheroptions,-1,Sun Jul 5 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry but you're wrong.   Those caught driving below the speed limit can be charged with a moving violation for blocking or impeding traffic. In New York state, for example, a first-time fine for driving too slowly is $195 — more than some speeding tickets."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,NeedHelpWithExcel,4,Tue Jul 7 18:13:28 2015 UTC,What does that have to do with anything? No one is talking about the minimum limit.

pettyrevenge,3c642d,Bakkie,-12,Sun Jul 5 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"Night time is not a valid reason to drive slowly, that is inexperience.  OP's inexperience led to him thinking someone else was the asshole instead of him.  You are going down that same path.  OP is a poor driver and wants it to be someone else's fault."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,10,Sun Jul 5 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"""...and to make sure I didn't lose control in the rain,...""  Night time alone is not a reason, but night time and rain? That is an excellent reason to be extra careful.  It is a matter of balance.  If you are on a 30 mph street and slow to 20 mph for a curve, that's good. If you are driving 20mph on the straightaway, that's not good.  BUT, the kid/OP needed to get home and avoiding an accident trumps not being an asshole.  Lots and lots of traffic tickets are written as driving too fast for conditions."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,Bakkie,-11,Sun Jul 5 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"OK, then again the easiest solution was to let the other driver pass by pulling to the side.  OP created this situation by actively keeping someone moving at a pace slower than the speed limit, and then he whined about the situation he created and made worse.  OP is the cause of this problem and likely a lot of his own problems with the attitude he displays.  A separate thought would be that tickets are also written for obstructing traffic."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,8,Sun Jul 5 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"OP created this situation by actively keeping someone moving at a pace slower than the speed limit   No, dickhead driver created the situation by tailgating someone with their brights on in poor road conditions.  Which bit of ""the speed limit is a Limit, not a minimum"" is beyond your comprehension?"
pettyrevenge,3c642d,TheDocJ,15,Mon Jul 6 09:47:05 2015 UTC,"So you would rather OP drive fast, and crash and get injured? He's inexperienced, sure, but you can't say ""get off the road,"" because the only way to gain experience is by driving. He's under no obligation to pull over and let the other driver pass. It's a no pass zone. That means no passing."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,sosthaboss,-8,Sun Jul 5 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"You're right, but i think the tailgater gets a little slack, because driving in the rain at night is safe at and above the speed limit. The reason OP was going slow is a lack of confidence. OPs driving was bad, but understandable and not unsafe. Yeah the guy was a dick about it, but getting stuck behind someone going under the speed limit is very frustrating."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,Krono5_8666V8,3,Sun Jul 5 17:02:26 2015 UTC,"The only slack tailgater should get is on the rope before the drop. /s  Driving at the limit in the rain at night might or might not be safe (relatively speaking, anyway), depending on all sorts of factors, neither you nor I were there to be able to judge that. Tailgating is never safe, in any situation, doing so in the rain doubly dangerous, and at night while dazzling the driver in front compounds it further.  And the fact that some will Still attempt to defend the tailgater and blame the cautious driver goes some way to explaining why there are so many people killed and seriously injured in road accidents every day."

pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,5,Sun Jul 5 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I think u/sosthaboss and OP both said it was a no pass zone."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,SQUID_KILLER,-13,Sun Jul 5 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"No passing doesn't necessarily mean OP couldn't have pulled over to let a car pass, it meant that there were solid double yellow lines or a narrow section of road.  Regardless of the justifications, OP didn't like the fact that someone  was behind him while he was going admittedly slow, and then decided to slow down further.  Those are the facts, and that is brilliant reasoning on the part of OP, he didn't like someone close behind so slow down and allow them to get legally closer (following distance is related to speed) and then keep him there.  OP created his own problem and then complained about it and you are rationalizing it for him.  Also u/sosthaboss isn't OP."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,5,Sun Jul 5 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't realise I needed to state that the OP also mentioned the same thing since it was directly implied, but I've amended it just for you"
pettyrevenge,3c642d,SQUID_KILLER,-10,Sun Jul 5 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"Again, just because it was a no passing zone does not mean that OP couldn't have pulled over.  How are you missing that?  OP caused his problem.  I have to assume you and the other 3 defenders are also poor drivers and defending his behavior to vindicate yourselves.  I don't honestly care enough to continue this.  OP can keep it up and he will be responsible for what happens when someone decides they want to be a bigger asshole, he admitted he isn't a good driver and so how will he respond when someone decides they've had enough of him trying to fuck with them and decide to do the same to him i.e. forcing him off the road?"
pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,3,Sun Jul 5 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"No passing doesn't mean op couldn't have pulled over.

pettyrevenge,3c642d,SQUID_KILLER,2,Sun Jul 5 21:19:05 2015 UTC,No in that instance (just like this one) it would be the fault of the other person.

pettyrevenge,3c642d,TheDocJ,6,Mon Jul 6 09:50:34 2015 UTC,"Rain + night is an excuse.  Many states have a clause worded similarly too ""reasonable and prudent under the circumstances, conditions and actual and potential hazards then existing.""  Rain and dark is a perfectly legal excuse.  This is going under the assumption s/he was driving a reasonable speed for the rain and night:  rain+night=5 below might be fine.  Heavy (i.e. pooling on the road) + night = even slower is ok.  Misting rain + night = unsafe to drive too slow.  I have definitely heard of people who have been ticketed for driving even below the speed limit in snow storms but still too fast to be considered safe."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,broken_ankles,-12,Sun Jul 5 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"I missed the rain part in my first pass, but the problem remains the same.  OP trying to force others to go at a speed he felt OK with.  The appropriate solution would have been to pull over and let the other driver pass, OP refused and then made the situation worse.  OP is fully in the wrong and you are reinforcing that poor behavior by defending it.  He should have pulled over, didn't, and then whined about potentially causing a road-rage situation.  This is OP's fault, period."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,3,Sun Jul 5 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"OP trying to force others to go at a speed he felt OK with.   Unlike Mr Tailgater who is just out for a pleasant drive in the rain, I suppose?"
pettyrevenge,3c642d,TheDocJ,-2,Mon Jul 6 10:01:51 2015 UTC,"Or trying to encourage an admittedly slow driver to pull over to let him pass.  In America in order to encourage someone to speed up or pull over you flash your high beams at them, it is in the drivers handbook, meaning it is the law here.  Dude didn't like the brights, he should have pulled over.  Obstruction of traffic is a crime.  OP was doing just that.  So to sum it up, no, you are incorrect."
pettyrevenge,3c642d,PM_PICS_OF_ME_NAKED,7,Mon Jul 6 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"Or trying to encourage an admittedly slow driver   So, having missed the part about the rain, did you also miss the part about speeding up to the speed limit and still being tailgated?  It is a while since I have driven in the US, but flashing main beams does not appear to have anything like the official meaning you claim, expect possibly in California:  Flash Flash  and is clearly straightforewardly illegal in some states. But that is a moot point anyway since OP did not talk about flashing main beams, but about driving with them on (or did you miss That bit as well - hope you pay more attention when you are driving!)  I am also pretty sure that driving more slowly that some impatient areshole would like is not, of itself, obstruction of traffic, and therefore not a crime.  Tell me, no matter how badly someone else may or may not be driving, how does tailgating them ever improve the situation?  Edit: Added ""and still being tailgated"""
pettyrevenge,3c642d,TheDocJ,-4,Mon Jul 6 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"You are making assumptions about the speed OP was going at.  Do you get tailgated while travelling at an appropriate speed?  It is difficult to make out what you are trying to say in your second to last paragraph, so it's difficult to rebut it.  I'm going to assume you meant to say that traveling below the speed limit with vehicles behind you is not impeding their progress at the posted speed, after all that's what obstruction of traffic is in the most basic sense.  I have to disagree on that point, after all that's why there's a posted speed limit.  I believe your biggest problem with my post, I'm sure you'll have something to say about this, is that you believed I meant that OP would be legally responsible, and he would be for that turning junk, I've seen tickets issued for exactly that, but I meant that he would have caused the situation he was in by not letting the other driver by.  He wouldn't be legally responsible for much, but that wouldn't stop somebody from running him off the road.  They would be legally at fault for running him off the road, but they probably wouldn't wait to see if OP was OK or for the cops to arrive.  Being within his legal rights won't prevent someone from potentially killing him.  My basic point, which you and others are dancing around, is that OP tried to make someone angrier and would have had to deal with the repercussions of his behavior without the aid of the police if the other driver had chosen to be as much of an ass as OP was."

pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Understated_Crazy,384,Fri Jul 3 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"This is the only type of situation i would let my dog off his leash.  We've had jack russells thinking they could just torment my puppy and get away with it since he's on a leash, but the second i take my dog off his leash it's apparently me who can't control her dog.   For reference - my puppy is a one year old Akita who wouldn't even hurt a fly and would probably lick you to death given the chance."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Pinklady4128,181,Fri Jul 3 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is that mindset among owners of small dogs that all their aggressive anti-social behavior is ""cute"". My own experience is that larger dogs tend to be better behaved because they have to be, but it only takes a couple seconds, a bite to the collar, and a quick shake to turn your little precious into a former pet and that is, frankly, something you should take into account when you let your small dog off its leash."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,johnnyslick,92,Fri Jul 3 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"Fuck yes! I have two dogs, one is 5lb, one is 11lb.  They both have excellent recall, any aggressive behavior off leash gets them snatched up and taken to their crate or back to the car. I know my pups are small and easily hurt, I work just as hard with their manners as I do with my stepmom's Rottweiler mix. (Actually, I work harder with my dogs. Because if they get torn up, my money goes to patching them up.) Plus, I would really hate for a big dog owner to have to live with ""My dog killed her dog"" when their dog was just protecting itself.   I hate seeing antisocial, nasty small dogs. It creates this expectation that all small dogs are nasty and makes my two pups look bad by association. We don't go to dog parks very often because I have seen too many bigger dogs who don't have any manners at all. (And for each badly behaved big dog, probably two little ones, to be entirely fair.)"
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,UndeadKitten,48,Fri Jul 3 23:39:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen that mindset about small dogs amongst large dog owners. I had a pug who was terrible around other dogs. On the rare occasions that we would take him to the park he was always leashed, and there were even acouple times we left early because he could not stop trying to get at other (larger) dogs.  Some people just don't understand that animals have personalities, and that some animals are just dicks.  I had this conversation once:  Rando Dog Owner: ""Oh, let him meet my dog!""  Me: ""No thanks, he's really bad about other dogs""  RDO: ""It'll be okay, he's so small!""  Me (as I am holding him in my arms while he SHRIEKS with rage at being held back): ""No, he doesn't want to play with your dog, he wants to fight""  RDO: ""My dog really wants to meet him!""  Me: Walks away, carrying a still shrieking and barking pug.   We would occasionally take him to the off-leash park, but he just spent all his time there chasing other dogs, trying to t-bone them."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,PollyNo9,37,Sat Jul 4 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"I've had almost exactly the same conversation! My dog's a golden retriever and just looks like a big teddy bear, but a small dog attacked him when he was a puppy and he's had this horrible bully temperament towards smaller dogs ever since. I'm honestly not standing here with my hand round his snout for my own welfare. It's because if I let go he will bite your dog. Now call him back before I bite you."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Petrollika,11,Sat Jul 4 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yes! My boyfriend and I have a pitbull who was the runt of his litter and has been attacked on multiple occasions by other dogs (a pair of German Shepherds from down the street that got loose from their yard twice before the owner installed a fence, and bf's parents' dog who ours used to be able to play with.)   He now has an aggressive/assertive reaction to most other dogs because he feels threatened, no matter what size they are. I have to be careful where and when I walk him because seeing dogs in their yards or passing too many other people walking their dogs will really upset him.   We were recently walking on a trail by the river and encountered two off leash chihuahuas that came tearing around a bend, barking aggressively and nipping at my dog's heels. Needless to say he freaked out, as I screamed at the owner (a good twenty yards away and not doing anything to help) that he needed to keep his dogs on a leash. When he finally got them under control, all he said was ""Oh they're harmless, this one just has a big mouth.""  I had to stop to calm my dog down and let the guy get a good ways ahead of us before we could keep walking. And once he was up ahead far enough, he let his dogs off the fucking leash again, all the way back to the parking lot. My poor dog was traumatized for the rest of the walk, pulling and frothing against his gentle leader. I know from experience too that if the chihuahuas had been leashed and we'd been able to just walk past them it wouldn't have been an issue. People need to be aware that small dogs can attack and be just as aggressive and distressing as larger ones."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,suzysparrow,6,Sat Jul 4 12:46:31 2015 UTC,"I don't have a dog but I had a pair of chihuahuas come up to me aggressively. I told the owner that the next time, if those dogs do actually bite me, I will kick the absolute shit out of them and make sure they're dead. That made the owner put the leash back on really quickly.  Another time, my Dad was walking their old dog when the dog across the street came out of nowhere and had him by the neck. Luckily Dad was able to kick it off hard enough to make it retreat. Whenever someone walks our Dog now, they carry a bat. If that dog comes back for round 2, it's dead.  I love animals, but I love my animals the most. I'm 6' 220lbs so if yours comes at me or mine and actually gets a bite in, you better be ready for a badly injured or dead dog. I won't stop until it runs away or is immobilized."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,RBD22,6,Sat Jul 4 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's crazy. I'd do the same thing as you and your dad.   Yeah, every time I walk with my dog down on that trail now I fantasize about running into that guy again and asking him how he'd feel if my dog was the one off leash, approaching his dogs the same way they did mine.   Or, if I wasn't afraid I'd get my dog put down because of it, I'd actually let him off his leash and let him rip those little rats to bits. Okay, I wouldn't because that's terrible, but I was seriously considering it at the time.   It sucks having to feel afraid because so many dog owners don't know how to properly train or control their pets :("
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,suzysparrow,7,Sat Jul 4 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"Just because he's ""as sweet as can be"" to you and your kids doesn't mean that he is automatically perfectly social off a leash. Besides, you can never be sure how another dog will react to your dog's approach. Better to be safe than sorry.   I would hate to have to resort to violence to control a situation, but as I said before, if I have to choose between myself/my dog or someone else's dog, I will choose mine every single time."

pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,johnnyslick,12,Sat Jul 4 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"Friends of mine have a couple of greyhounds, which it turns out are much bigger than most people seem to think.  They're both rescues, the first was 3 or so when they got her, but the second was less than a year and still pretty small.  The first took a while to be ok with attention/socialisation after 3 years in the racing industry, but the second was your average puppy attitude. So any time I'd visit I'd make sure to sit down and give her lots of cuddles while she'd lay in my lap, all the while going with ""who's a good lapdog? yes you are"" while looking right at my friends.   She's pretty big now, and still an adorable lapdog."

Although my cousin isn't exactly the law abiding citizen, he got his vet to write out a paper saying the dog was euthanized, then sent the paper to the court and the dog to my mom.

pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,UndeadKitten,43,Fri Jul 3 23:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, shit like the court ordering a dog to be put down when it is obviously not that dog's fault is fucking stupid. It pisses me off just reading it. I bet they wouldn't feel the same about their own dog..."

(a LOT of stitches, thankfully her parents were awesome and didn't sue or keep us apart, but my parents did pay the insurance co-pays for her treatment.) We still don't know why, but Mom paid extra to have its brain examined and no sign of rabies.  It was awful, but we had to do it. But the bloodhound was a good boy, he stayed with us for four years or so then passed in his sleep.  Come to think of it, the cousin that owned him first was a weird one when it came to dogs. He in addition to faking the dog's death also stole at least three dogs out of neglectful owners' backyards and once about killed himself (and got pneumonia) wading out into a cold ass river to grab a puppy someone dropped off a bridge.

However, his cute physical appearance is nothing compared to the hellish nightmare and unending hunger that boils beneath the surface. Our neighbors had gotten a very small breed of dog for their children, and it was often loose through the neighborhood. The dog, young but fully grown, had a near death experience on account of our own dog.  One day, it was doing its usual routine; playing on our front lawn and enjoying a barking contest with our two dogs through the window. My dad had just parked in the driveway and was heading up the steps, ignoring the neighbors dog just as the neighbors were doing. However, this was not the little devil's day. As my father opened the screen door, a blur the same pitch black as Satan's heart rushed past his legs and tackled the closing door like a raging bull. Foaming with anger, and snarling in barely contained rage, the overweight dachshund had thrown himself past my father and through the doorway. Hell had opened it's gaping maw like a hungry crocodile, and loosed it's most vicious demon. The Eternal Anger. The Undying Black Flame. He Who Has Claimed One Thousand Souls. Oliver, the elderly dachshund, was free.   In seconds, he had propelled his fat body to near light speed and caught the smaller dog between his jaws. Death was certain, and my dachshund was reveling in the fresh soul that was about to be devoured. His fur bristled like the wolves of old, and the few teeth that remained in his ancient jaws glistened with saliva and ichor. Oliver was about to consume the soul of this youthful dog, to extend his unnaturally long life. God wept in the heavens above, and the flames of Hell burned brightly, awaiting the expected soul.  Oliver closed his jaws with lightning speed... but only succeeded in catching fur and air. The smaller dog, having just seen it's short life flash before it's eyes, scampered away at top speed. Oliver gave chase, but without the momentum behind him, was too slow to catch his prey. The smaller dog was not seen on our front lawn again."

She treated him like a child who could do no wrong, and he's been a bit of a pain ever since.   Oliver's nails are usually very short due to his excessive digging. My theory is that he's trying to dig his way back to hell, but he might just be doing it for fun."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Princess_Fancypants,5,Sun Jul 5 05:09:52 2015 UTC,"Not really. Certain breeds were breed for certain reasons, and purebreds are absolutely bred for temperament. Daschunds were bred for hunting badgers and therefore had 'gameness' bred into them. Which means they are quick to temper and eager to go after targets. Upbringing can only change so much of what was already hardwired in. For example that digging behavior you are talking about. That's not digging to hell, that's digging for a badger burrow. You didn't teach him that, but someone else in the past sure did and made certain they bred that behavior into subsequent generations.  Edit: sorry feels don't make reals 😊"
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,altreality239,2,Sun Jul 5 06:32:47 2015 UTC,Disagree.  Parents have five dachschunds who I see about two weeks a year so Im not used to their behavior.  Very sweet and loving dogs.  Only bark until you ask them to stop.  Aggressive behavior is rare.  1 of the 5 will dig in the yard but ya know... shes a dog.
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Princess_Fancypants,3,Sun Jul 5 07:44:15 2015 UTC,"Anecdotal evidence is the worst kind of evidence   From the wiki: ""Dachshunds are playful, but as hunting dogs can be quite stubborn,[18] and are known for their propensity for chasing small animals, birds, and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity.[19][20][21] Many dachshunds are stubborn, making them a challenge to train.[   Dachshunds are statistically more aggressive to both strangers and other dogs.[28] Despite this, they are rated in the intelligence of dogs as an average working dog with a persistent ability to follow trained commands 50% of the time or more.[29] They rank 49th in Stanley Coren's Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working and obedience intelligence. They can have a loud bark. Some bark quite a lot and may need training to stop, while others will not bark much at all.[20][21] Dachshunds are known for their devotion and loyalty to their owners,[21][30] though they can be standoffish towards strangers.[19] ""  So while I'm glad you have Daschunds that don't conform to breed standard, you have just that. That behavior is not typical nor standard for the breed.  Edit: you also say aggression is rare, not absent, which doesn't disagree with me at all. Plenty of breed of dogs have been bred to exhibit no aggression whatsoever. You also probably don't know the extent of training your parents did in order to get to that point"

Aside from that kind of thing, I once was at a yard sale and someone came up with their dog. The elderly woman who was having the sale backed into her garage and asked the owner to leave and come back without their dog. After they left, the lady explained to us that she was in WWII Poland, and when she would get out of school, sometimes soldiers would be there waiting with dogs. They would let the dogs off-leash and they would chase the children down the road. I always think of that now every time I see an off-leash dog. It just upsets me more."

pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Petrollika,10,Sat Jul 4 08:40:45 2015 UTC,My big ass GSD always gets humped by the little dogs haha. He's also defensive only when on his lead or restrained in any way (if I grab his harness) so chances are I'll actually let him off when another dog comes over. Normally they realise he's a lot bigger than they initially thought
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,joe-clark,14,Fri Jul 3 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"I hate off-leashers, simply because even if the dog is ""friendly"" it can lead to a dangerous situation for the dog or other people if the dog is untrained and sometimes even if the dog is trained. People like them helped in giving me a phobia of dogs until I was in 4th grade."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Petrollika,9,Fri Jul 3 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly! You dont know what the dog is gonna do, the best case scenario is to just walk away."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Maltoron,15,Fri Jul 3 23:08:14 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about unleashed dogs. Especially when their dog is not trained well enough to stay away from my dog. My family got a rescue purebred golden retriever, my mom wanted a golden because our last dog who was not a rescue was the sweetest most loving dog. This dog was about 5 when we got him now he's almost 7. He's perfectly fine with people but he has some issues here and there. He has what seems to be a complete inability to socialize with other dogs. For some reason he is a total asshole to any dog for no apparent reason. He doesn't seem like he wants to hurt them until he gets close. If I hold him back from other dogs he just wines and wags his tail and looks like he wants to play, which is especially bad because this usually makes other owners think he is very friendly also usually Golden's are very nice. Anyways if he gets close enough he goes full attack mode teeth showing, growling, barking. Onetime I was walking him and this little shit of a dog that couldn't have weighed more than ten pounds comes running over to him barking and growling, the owner nowhere to be seen. My dog just kind of standing not seeming to care, luckily I knew better than to trust that. When this dog got within about two feet of him he fucking lunges at this dog with this mouth open and I jerked back hard on his leash. He didn't get the little dog but he almost did and thankfully the little dog ran to its owner who was yelling for the dog saying ""don't do that you'll get eaten!"". I'm glad that little dog ran away, not sure what my dog would have done exactly but he weighs 75 pounds so I imagine it could have gotten ugly really quick."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,joe-clark,6,Sat Jul 4 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, are you me?! We got our golden when he was around 4 or 5, he's 10 now. He does exactly the same thing, wants to be friends until the dog approaches, then goes for them. He was attacked by a small dog when he was a puppy, and he's hated dogs smaller than him ever since. We can't even leash him until the dog's out of sight then let him go again, because he turns back and pursues them."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Maltoron,3,Sat Jul 4 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"I can't even let him off the leash. And he can be so nervous we can't use the invisible fence we had used with our previous dog. Also people who live nearby that recognise us and the dog think he is our old dog sometimes which has resulted in some problems. Also he hates cars, or at least he hates when somebody he knows is in a car that is also moving. I'm in college now and when I visit my family I drive. When I get in my car to leave he's fine up until the point where the car starts moving, though he has been known to loose his shit if I get in and start the engine if the door is already closed. Another weird thing he does is whenever anybody leaves the house and doesn't take him he marches around with his leash in protest."
pettyrevenge,3c0t3x,Natty_Ice,3,Sat Jul 4 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"I'm lucky to live in an area with lots of quiet places to take him. If there's even a chance of another dog around though, it's a completely on-lead walk. He had the car phobia too! He's ok now, but it took 2 months of having both doors open, me at one side waving treats and my mum at the other making sure he didn't just run right around. We also made sure that every car journey was to an exciting place. That seemed to stop him freaking out when other people left too, weirdly. He used to be scared of men, but thankfully that seems to be well in the past. He's scared of cats; bottles; crisp packets; vehicles about the size of a bus; things that make a noise but don't have mouths (e.g. phones, TVs); rodents... there's more, but it's a thankfully dwindling list. What kind of build is your retriever? The ones that are more tall and slender seem to be more predisposed to being completely neurotic."

The plus side to having that is a) it's safe to use in the car in case I have an accident while she's in the car, and b) if she needs to be picked up/ pulled out of the way I can yank of pretty much any part of the harness and can lift her up with ease. I used to walk her with it because she was bad at pulling and was slightly too stupid to realise that she was choking herself. It also came in handy when a big aggressive dog started chasing her, I just picked her up out of the way. Now she can walk with a collar, and we moved so I only use the harness for the car. But I liked the multi-functionality of a car harness. Just thought I'd share my two cents if you're thinking about harnesses."

pettyrevenge,3bz7ae,EHP42,9,Sat Jul 4 07:29:11 2015 UTC,"So a fasting Muslim should not be allowed in school, because he's practicing his religion? All the school did was set aside a room so that a portion of their students would have a place to pray, probably because if they didn't, they'd be praying in the hallways, which would be more disruptive. They didn't force anyone to pray."
pettyrevenge,3bz7ae,lostandfoundat40,-4,Sat Jul 4 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, way to take it too far. I did not say that a religious person should not be allowed in school because they practice their religion. I do believe however that No Religion, no matter what the religion should be practiced in a public school. Public schools are not the place for such things. We send our kids there to learn reading, math, social skills, etc.  They can learn religious studies as an elective in collage or university. Religion should be practiced in the home or in a mosque, church, temple, what have you.  Schools should not redesign or decorate their spaces because what is there might offend one religion."
pettyrevenge,3bz7ae,EHP42,5,Sun Jul 5 01:43:55 2015 UTC,"To many, religion is as much a part of daily life as brushing teeth, or wearing clothes. Categorically saying that no religion should even be practiced in a school of as good as saying you don't think certain religions should go to school. What's the harm in letting a Muslim pray in a vacant room, or letting a Christian say grace or wear a cross, or letting a Jew wear a yarmulke? Those are all people practicing their religion, but you think none of that should be allowed for some reason.  I'd rather my kids be exposed to other religions in school because in real life, they will run into those religions. As you stated, learning social skills is a part of public school, and as part of that I'd say seeing and dealing with people different than you is important too."
pettyrevenge,3bz7ae,lostandfoundat40,-4,Sun Jul 5 01:55:56 2015 UTC,"You really want me top be the bad person here don't you? I never said that people should not be allowed to wear religious items, or say grace or pray, I said that schools should not decorate or change things to cater to one religions sense of whats right and wrong. Art work should not be removed from walls because the subject matter might offend one religion.    I'd rather my kids be exposed to other religions in school because in real life, they will run into those religions.   seeing and dealing with people different than you is important too.   I am not in anyway saying that kids of different religions should not go to school together. Just that religion should not be practiced in school. That is a key difference.

pettyrevenge,3bud9x,UndeadKitten,16,Thu Jul 2 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"god, I hate being honked at, as a bike rider or a pedestrian. I have a strong startle and anxiety, so it leaves me shaky for anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours.  My grandmother (who is a monster, this isn't the sweet loving granny type) once made me veer down a ditch side by beeping at me unexpectedly from behind when I didn't recognize her car and was riding down a dirt road. She laid on the horn and I startled, thankfully down the ditch not into the fucking road. (I know, cyclists should have better control, but I was 17 and that road was almost always either empty, or had farm trucks and semis, both of which never beeped their horns at me, although the farm trucks would yell my name and wave.)  So I just got a sprained shoulder and a destroyed bike, not run over by the semi that was to my other side. (The semi driver actually pulled over and ran back to where I was to see if I was okay. Thank god for my helmet, it got a huge dent from a brick in the dirt.)  I walked my bike back home (a few miles) limping and Bitch was already at my house laughing with my mom and aunt about giving me a ""little surprise"". My mom's laugh stopped really quick.  She wasn't sorry even after I was in a sling for several weeks. (My mom and aunt were sorry they'd laughed though. Especially since they had to make room in the household budget for my ER bill, my arm was bent weird and we weren't sure if it was broken or not. It wasn't it was just sprained bad and hurt to bend normally) My aunt still thinks I over reacted, which I probably did but who the fuck thinks its funny to lay on a horn at a biker?  Keep being unrepentant, I'm too shy to flip anyone off but I swear someday I'm gonna have a damn heart attack."

(my grandmother)  My aunt I think did exactly as you said, found it embarrassing that she had laughed at me before she found out how bad a fall I took and then wanted to brush it off as me not being careful enough so she didn't have the shame of having laughed at her injured niece. I wish she would let it go actually, she still gets red faced and uncomfortable if someone brings it up (I have continuing issues with the shoulder I fell on, so it comes up during family talks) and she didn't DO anything. She laughed about me falling yeah, but that was before and probably she thought it was a little slip not a tumble down a ditch wall.  It killed any desire I had for a bike as my form of transport though. I live in NC now and its a beautiful state. Perfect for biking and biking would probably be great for my health, but I keep thinking what if I startle and go down the side of a mountain road."

It was the kind of afternoon where things felt a bit off.  There was more traffic than usual and what traffic there was seemed to be in quite the rush.  We could also hear yelling of some sort which wasn't really all that unheard near a college campus but still off putting to an extent.  Next thing we know we both hear the sound of a vehicle's motor running a little higher than it should on a residential street.  We turn around just in time to see an SUV full of college girls pummeling us with water balloons.  Partially miffed and mostly curious, we gravitate towards what seems to be the epicenter of the bullshit.    The closer we get to the house, the more we're ignored like a couple of birds casually flying through a war zone.  Trucks, suvs and bicycles are flailing about madly, all equipped with buckets and buckets of water baloons.  We very soon realize that the mayhem is emanating from a house which happens to be a fraternity's unofficial party house.  This fraternity also happens to be an exclusively black fraternity and my buddy and I are over 6 feet tall and covered in tattoos with menacing, mildly damp looks on our faces.  A quick glance at each other confirms that we both had the same thought.  The tall, metaled out, pierced, angrily clammy white kids wander in the front door where there are no less than 25 black folks relaxing and/or filling water balloons in the kitchen.  Scorsese couldn't have written a better choreographed scene.  The music almost immediately came to a halt and anyone who wasn't already in the sizable living room peeked in, having sensed the pending conflict.  After what seemed to me to be a sufficient number of awkward seconds I said ""We got hit by some of your girls...""  I let the words sink in for just another second or two.   ""I think revenge is in order""  And the crowd goes fucking nuts.  The next hour or so was spent gallivanting about the neighborhood armed with super soakers and bandoleers of water balloons.  They were also only two blocks from our rental at the time which lent itself to a pretty damn good year overall."

Most American cars go with superchargers over turbochargers so that's why I'm guessing the above manufacturers. I'm hoping it's a Subaru because that's what I drive. lol.

The 2009 was a 5-speed and the transmission was having issues at only 81,039 miles (my last reading before trading it in). The 2015 is a 6-speed and shifts much smoother.   The clutch on my 2009, was extremely stiff, like a cold knife cutting through ice cold butter, I had to really force the pedal down. On the 2015 it's like a hot knife running through warm butter.   Power boost is extremely minimal (3HP lol) but the 2.0 liter engine on the 2015 gives me better gas mileage while still getting good power. Handling is still great, if not better than the 2009.   I've only had it for about 2 weeks, but I love it, way way more than my 2009. My 2009 will hold a place in my heart as my 1st Subaru but the 2015 is much better in almost every single aspect. Plus, I got a premium, so now I have a moonroof! lol.   TL;DR I like it a lot and it's much better than my 2009 was."

My favorite story:  I was in the front of a line of cars stopped at a light. It was two lanes but the right lane was a right turn only, as there was only one lane across the intersection. This douchey hick in a lifted pickup truck, of which I can only assume is compensation for his small small penis, decided he wanted to go straight but not wait in line like everyone else. Light turns green and I hit the gas hard, because like a smart person I knew he was trying to cut me off. He floors it but to his dismay I am in the lane preventing his fuckery. The road starts to narrow into my one lane. Right as his tires slip off the road I look over and give him the smuggest middle finger. I ran him off the road so well he didn't get back on until the light turned red again and all the traffic had passed."

There is an area near us with a short, high traffic, double lane, on-ramp onto a major interstate, however the right lane merges in just before joining the highway (I've been nearly run off by assholes while driving normally, its not a nice place).   He was in the left lane turning on normally, and some guy tried to floor it and beat him to the merger like a total asshole. My brother didn't let that happen and beat him to the highway.  The guy was pissed and tried to race him on the highway. My brother, being an idiot, indulged him for a moment and then backed off with the guy going at least 20 over.   After slowing down to the speed limit and rounding the next bend, guess who he saw pulled over."

You're obviously some right wing feminist, calling men ""it"" in all your posts makes you sound fucking crazy as well as petty. Before you say that men call women dehumanizing things or whatever excuse you have in your head, yes, they do. They're also petty childish, and disrespectful. Crawl out of your feminist hole and grow the fuck up. Try active communication rather than passive aggressiveness, maybe you'll learn what a healthy relationship is."

Not wanting to miss my chance, I stood there and waited for 10 minutes ready to pounce the minute that washer freed up.  Just as the washer is about to finish, two girls walk in with their hampers, one empty and one full. As one girl began transferring her wet clothes to her hamper, I smiled to the girl with the full hamper and made some comment about how it sucked one of the washers wasn't working and moved to get my clothes.  By now the other girl had quickly removed her wet clothes and, as they both ignored me, took the other hamper from her friend and began to load what was apparently more of her clothes. I tried to reason with her that I had been waiting and it wasn't fair for her to do two loads of laundry during peak hours with limited washers available. She pretty much ignored me and said how she'd been waiting too.  I wish I could've had some nice revenge like you :("

They had it blocked off right before an exit ramp. I wasn't too far behind the blockade, so I could see that that's what it was. A blockade created by multiple police cars. Traffic was at a dead stop for an hour because the plane was late in landing.   People who were sitting in traffic further back decided to zip down the emergency lane in an attempt to get to that exit, and because of the way the lanes curved the police blockade was hidden until you were right on top of it. Which is what happened. They found themselves at a dead stop, in front of the cops, with no way of merging back into traffic because everyone was in park.

There was one time half a decade ago, while driving back from Toronto, that I was going about 40 km/h over the limit (about 25 mph) on the highway, at around 1-2 am. While slowly passing an 18-wheeler (he had to be going at least 30 km/h over himself), I saw the front lights of some guy sticking to my ass through my mirror. So I accelerated a bit more to pass the truck, and merged in the right lane as soon as I got in front of him, slowing down slightly while doing so. Then, the guy that was previously driving way too close to me started passing me, and as he did so I looked to see what kind of car it was, now that I wasn't completely blinded by his lights. That's when I realized that he was a cop, and I may or may not have shouted ""HOLY FUCK!"", waking up both of my passengers.   Needless to say, I don't drive that fast anymore."

And having had a speed camera fine, I don't have a problem with that approach.  If you are the registered keeper, it is your responsibility who you let drive your vehicle - much the same that you can be in trouble for letting an uninsured or unlicensed driver use your vehicle. So if a kid gets stopped driving his parents car when he (or, occasionally, she) shouldn't be, they have the choice of saying that parent knew they had the vehicle, in which case parent is in trouble too, or else that parent Didn't know they had the vehicle, in which case driver gets done for twoccing too."

Her license didn't get suspended or taken away at some point? She can just keep doing it without paying more in insurance?   All of that tells me her story is bs. You can't just keep getting speeding ticket after speeding ticket without consequences outside of the ticket.

It's a special case here, because it happens on a three-lane (each way) highway with a shoulder that turns into a fourth lane at rush hour. For about four hours each weekday you can legally drive on the ""shoulder"" but the rest of the time it's not a travel lane. Most people obey, but an amazingly large minority of people use it whenever traffic is a little slow. I don't know if they're completely clueless as to what the big red lighted X signs and above the lane mean, or if they just don't care, but when I hit heavy traffic on that road it's not common for me to get passed on the shoulder by literally dozens of cars over a few miles. I don't know why the police aren't more aggressive about stopping them. Ought to be an easy source of revenue."

In Hamlet, Shakespeare has Hamlet say    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer  Hoist with his own petar'   meaning that the letters that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are carrying will lead to their deaths, not his own. So what, you say? Here's what: ""petard"" comes from the Middle French péter ""to fart,"" from the sound of the explosion. So when you used the Shakespeare reference, you were, apparently unknowingly (which to my mind makes it all the cooler), making a multilayered pun on explosive farting, which fits this story perfectly. 😁"

pettyrevenge,3bq2w6,KCchemist,2,Wed Jul 1 18:03:51 2015 UTC,In places where hurricanes or other natural disasters are common it's not a bad idea to have a basic landline. I live in Florida and had one so I could call my parents even if there was a blackout lasting more then a week. I could charge my cellphone in my car but if I wasn't going out much I would rather reserve the battery as much as possible.   TL/DR I paid for the landline to make my parents feel better.

I refused to do things that would involve scamming our patients and committing insurance fraud so they claimed I was ""disrespectful and insubordinate"" and let me go.

I came in the next day and the CEO with HR VP in tow told me they knew about the offer and were letting me go.  They didn't want a transition of my contracts, files or updates on my teams. I didn't offer and apparently they didn't know where I kept all my operational files since they deleted my sharepoint partition when I left (found out from former co-worker).

Since I left they've gone through 5 people in my old spot in less than two years. I don't have much faith in the company making it through the year.  A big problem was the way I was let go. Not only did they not get a good transition they rubbed alot of people the wrong way. Apparently it got pretty dark after I left. All my Program Managers left almost right away, my top developers were gone within 6 months. I heard the CFO made it a point in her resignation and a lot more people ended up leaving in the first year. Quite a few are working with me again or one of our vendors over here though so it worked out for us.  At one point they tried to claim I was laid off for performance reasons, but HR had already provided me with a statement indicating that I was not let off for performance reasons but due to company downsizing (always get things in writing). That left a bit of egg on their face when I told my coworkers ""oh, you must have misunderstood check out this email with attached document""  Honestly it worked out for the best and drove home a key point ""Take care of your people and they will take care of you.

pettyrevenge,3bjoiu,DoddzyBaby,14,Tue Jun 30 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at it.  The United States needs a standing military as a deterrent to force. Any relatively large and populated country does.  People volunteering to serve in the military prevents people from having to be conscripted into the military to keep numbers up.  So fighting isn't exactly the right word there, yeah, but at the very least the fact that people volunteer to join our military keeps U.S. citizens free from mandatory military service, which definitely wouldn't come with all of the same freedoms a civilian has.  That and if, in the unlike event of a mainland invasion of the United States they would be the folks out there trying to keep that shit from making it to everyone's house."

Some say our military budget is so large because all the other countries just depend mostly on us to defend them. If you want to find answers (because I'm not nearly enough knowledgable about foreign affairs) try finding someone that doesn't assert opinions and just presents unbiased facts. Or get both biases (it'd be better to get moderate views from each side so you're not just comparing two ridiculous views and somehow trying to make sense of them) and compare the two. I wouldn't trust most of Reddit to get your information though. It has a very obvious bias.

Talk with a lawyer if you have any legal concerns and to know for sure what you can and cannot do."
pettyrevenge,3bk8cl,2OQuestions,3,Tue Jun 30 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"We've talked with the landlord a few times, and because of the rules of our lease, we had to amend anyone who was living there for more than 30 days. So we amended her in, and according to the contract, she as the same rights when it comes to us living there. The landlord was really sympathetic about it, because she knew the whole situation, but she still said that there isn't much she can do on her end. I had asked her that since she can't evict the roommate, if we could do it with a notarized letter from the city. She had said no, because we hadn't had roommate sign a roommate agreement. I'm not really sure if what she told us was factual, but she had been a landlord for several properties so I trusted her information. Roommate and I have been working on finding her a place, as I told her I'd like her out by the end of July (this was on good terms, unlike our other arguments about her leaving,) and she agreed. If she isn't out by then, than I'll probably take up your advice"
pettyrevenge,3bk8cl,twenty8twelve,2,Tue Jun 30 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"Is the roommate agreement a requirement within your municipality, or something the landlord does for her own reasons? If it's not a town/ city requirement, it shouldn't matter that she hasn't signed it.  You know your situation best. But I think it might be best to talk to the lawyer sooner rather than later, or if you don't want to talk to a lawyer yet, make a written, signed agreement (by you, her, and your spouse) that she will move out by 31st July 2015 (or whatever date you pick, as long as it's specified) preferably with at least one neutral witness when it's being signed (and dated). You don't need a lawyer or fancy legal document to do this as long as the meaning is plain and easy to understand. I only suggest this because if it came to going to court to get her to leave, a written and signed document is irrefutable evidence of the agreement, and having at least one witness will prove you did not force her to sign it. Oral agreements are too easy to lie about (not to say that I think you're lying) and would just waste time and money in court. That's my advice if you think you'll have any issues trying to get her to leave. I wish you the best!"

They had a rule that if a customer asked for more cheese you couldn't do it without charging them. In fact, if you were in the process of adding it and you hadn't even put in the standard amount yet, you were supposed to stop at exactly where you were in the cheese addition.  Customer once asked my friend if that was all the cheese he got, and my friend said, ""actually it looks like I did short you a little."" That earned him a written warning.  Of course, this franchise owner or manager--whatever--also ended up dumping a bucket of moldy shredded cheese every week because it didn't get used fast enough."

After OP figures out which claim it is and cuts a check to mail to the firm for payment, he/she throws away that little slip of paper with their file number on it - the one that says ""please return this page with payment,"" so that the law firm has to waste their time trying to figure out what invoice the check applies to.

pettyrevenge,3bf4gw,Mixcoatll,18,Sun Jun 28 19:02:11 2015 UTC,On some thermostats if you hold the fan button and the Up or down (depends) temp. button at the same time (you can look up the brand of the thermostat online for the user manual) there is an option about 65% of the time where you can set a code so no one can access it unless the input the code you set. (usually a 4-digit number.)
pettyrevenge,3bf4gw,Gengar11,6,Mon Jun 29 07:55:17 2015 UTC,Whenever I had roommates I always lived in an apt with an older style thermostat. The kind where you just slide a tab to the desired degrees; no buttons or electronic display. Now that I live with my gf I've just made her get used to it being slightly warmer instead of paying a ludicrous electric bill.
pettyrevenge,3bf4gw,Mixcoatll,37,Mon Jun 29 14:28:23 2015 UTC,"""passive"" and ""passive aggressive"" are incredibly different things. Indirectly dealing with an issue without facing it head on is passive aggressive. So, if they're both retooling the thermostat behind each other's backs, I'd call it passive aggressive. Regular aggressive would be saying ""yo quit fuckin with the thermostat because it upsets me"""

There's no reason the cashier couldn't have done that, especially since OP said it hadn't been a problem before.

If she needs to go anywhere but class, you're gonna need that extra $10 to make it $20 for the week, since the 10 only covers class rides.

pettyrevenge,3bbymf,TheDocJ,-60,Tue Jul 7 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"Actually electrohypersensitivity is a real phenomena. Sufferers experience symptoms hypothesized to be related to oxidative stress and range in severity from tinnitis, headache, and sleep problems to congestive heart failure and debilitating fatigue not to mention painful ""internal pressure"" related to proximity to the EMF (electromagnetic field). There is an ongoing study at UCSD looking at biomarkers of genetic predisposition. For more information you can email the study coordinators at: emfstudy@ucsd.edu . Lastly I'd like to point out: we have never had such prolonged, high levels of EMR in evolutionary history. We are now seeing negative effects that have ousted an entire portion of people in developed countries to the boondocks as ""EMF Refugees"". Imagine something that you are allergic to, like a rash from poison ivy but he just gets headaches. Not fun.   Tldr: sorry but adverse reactions to emf are real! Totally inconvenient for the both of you, but at least he is there short term. Move your router if you can :)  Edit: I am currently conducting the research study at UCSD"
pettyrevenge,3bbymf,Infuser,46,Sat Jun 27 23:37:46 2015 UTC,"That's just what the conspiracy websites say.  Here's how you can tell they're full of shit...  EVERY device that uses electricity emits an EM field.  And most of them are orders of magnitude more powerful than a wifi router, like your breaker box, the motor in your refrigerator, the transformers in your florescent lights, your television, your HVAC system.  But they're not complaining about that.  They're not even complaining about the other devices in the 2.4 Ghz band, like microwave ovens, bluetooth, or cordless phones.  No, no... all of those devices are fine.  It's specifically the 802.11 protocol that they're ""allergic"" to.  It's total bullshit.  They're just hypochondriacs."
pettyrevenge,3bbymf,ezinma,-41,Sun Jun 28 00:56:34 2015 UTC,Maybe i wasn't clear enough for you. The medical research study at UCSD that we are currently in process with is only one of many studies that are being conducted and have been already to better understand people's apparent electrohypersensitivity.   My information comes from my research. We hope to help those who are effected by EMF so that their condition is not just dismissed.   FYI different subjects have shown to be effected by a range of frequencies. Not every body has the same triggers.
pettyrevenge,3bbymf,sheps,47,Sun Jun 28 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"Bullshit.  There have been numerous studies done on people who claimed to have electromagnetic sensitivity.  Like this study, showing that ""EM sensitive"" patients were unable to determine whether or not an EM-emitting device was active.  Instead, they found that the severity of their symptoms correlated PERFECTLY to being TOLD that the devices were active.  In other words, it's psychosomatic."

Couple that with your claims of what the UCSD research shows despite the fact that that research is apparently ongoing, and you remind me of teh UK politicians whose name escapes me who stated, a few years ago that ""We know that this is the case, and we are now commissioning the research to prove it"" OWTTE.  Of course, the believers always claim to be motivated by a desire to help the sufferers - all very noble.

But these devices are all the same frequency: 2.4GHz. And shouldn't the amplitude (in a huge range of frequencies and types of radiation and EMF) of something like an exceptional sun spot or solar flare with the power to knock out a power grid be enough to incapacitate someone if they are that susceptible enough to get a headache from a router? If you are doing research in this area, the acute effects (if any) from sun spots would be interesting to analyze since there is no prompting of being near anything (quite the opposite if the power goes out)."

The manufacturer probably gave them an extra couple years on the warranty as long as they make sure people use the proper cleaner.  Some soaps and solutions can be hard on rubber hoses, gaskets, and plastic parts.  So to prevent wear and tear the manufacturer's make them sell the proper cleaning solution with the rental.  That being said I'm sure their are some home made formula's that are just as good and won't damage the machine in any way.  It's just like the olive garden thing.  They stopped salting the pasta water to get better warranties on their pots.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnAR8Vs0I&feature=player_detailpage#t=64"

First off, I don't believe for one second that the lack of normal stock was'nt a convenient excuse to enforce the rental/purchase policy of the larger jugs.   I totally get the warranty thing. I'm a Tech myself so I know about harsh chemicals and what they can do to hoses and gaskets. I had no problem using a smaller bottle offered by the store. The problem is, they had none. The shelf had a layer of dust that clearly had been there for months and even the extra large Jugs of carpet cleaner had dust as well. Not to mention a slight sun bleaching effect on the side that faced the door.  They wanted to move the larger product that wasn't selling. The Manager's reaction to the return and his original unwillingness to compromise reinforces this theory about it being a scam. Albeit a small and petty one."
pettyrevenge,3b8nso,WolfDemon,27,Fri Jun 26 22:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, if there is dust on those shelves, you can guarantee they just wanted the higher profits from the larger product and most people would likely pay it.  Be sure to leave them a nice Yelp review pointing out all the details."
