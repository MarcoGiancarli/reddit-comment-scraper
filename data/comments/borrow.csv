Not only that, but /u/QCPat has been extremely understanding and kind and helped me out through a super difficult transitional period when I had no money and didn't know when I was going to be getting any. I paid him back the second I could, but I'm super appreciative of that and for all the help he's given me.

That being said, those places were the first I went to. I found a few items but only managed one pair of slacks which is what I needed most.   I ended up going to Forever 21 in the mall here and was able to supplement a lot from their selection. Overall I got several pairs of pants and several tops. Enough to be able to make it look like I own more than one pair of pants now.   I'll be doing more shopping once my pay starts coming in and I'm able to pay back the loan.

It is awesome that people lend to others they don't know but there is no philanthropy involved...  EDIT: Just to clarify; I'm not a troll. I'm subbed to /r/borrow in the off chance that I might need some money or if I have money one day and decide to help out. When that day comes, you can bet your ass I won't charge a single penny in interest. I was just a bit riled up when I came across this post where the lender has loaned out like 12k in the last month or two. Ever since I saw that my perception of this sub changed just a bit.   I've never trolled in my life and I never say shit just to piss people off, it's just that if someone thinks this is a sub like /r/assistance then they're dead wrong."

People have a need, I fill it. If they had friends or family in their life able to help them out they likely would get a zero interest loan, but for whatever reason that's not the direction they took. There's likely a big mix of reasons people are lenders here and it's probably some ratio of philanthropy/money making. I spend time here, my time is worth something, therefore I would like to think I could get compensated a little for that plus sticking my neck out to help someone. I spend time at work and get paid for that too.  To answer your titular question;  Similarities: help people with financial troubles, gather information to contact borrower in the event they are late or delinquent, earn interest on the loan, take a chance that the borrower will not pay me back  Dissimilarities: I probably wouldn't ever seek legal recourse for an unpaid loan besides filing a PayPal dispute, I don't HOPE people default so I can earn more from their bad situation, I really want them to pay me back and I care about their story and why they need the money, it gives me great satisfaction to be thanked verbally for giving someone assistance  EDIT: I see you are a moderator for a few homelessness subs.

Some people just need extra spending money, some people just need better budgeting, some people have high paying jobs and just had an event which drained their savings...the reasons are wide and varied. To make the assumption that only people on minimum wage are here making loan requests is just downright ignorant 6 As to how this is different from ""Payday Loans"", there are quite a few differences.    it's person-to-person and the borrower usually says how much they want to pay back. ""interest"" doesn't accrue. If you miss your payment, guess what? You don't owe any more than you said you'd pay back.  There is no legal recourse. You decide to take off with the money, well tough luck lender. Sure you can file a paypal dispute, but that's not guaranteed. Try doing that with a payday loan and see if they don't ruin your life   No one here is under the illusion that they're not making money. And some people do it exclusively just to make money.

I can't speak for everyone but I am not low income (my lenders can attest to that) but we have hit a snag in the road because of an insurance reimbursement issue related to my son's autism.    We prefer not to accumulate debt and have a small credit card balance that is reserved for emergencies.  When I looked into getting more credit versus borrowing from here - I thought our situation would be very temporary so I didn't pursue more credit cards.  Even when we realized that our situation is more mid term than short term, we decided to stay here. This is time bound and keeps us honest.    Being a mod of a sub related to homelessness I would think you would be a bit slower to pigeon hole people.  You should know that people can get in over there head very easy. My husband and I sat down and realized that this method was best for us now.  In retrospect that was the right decision because given how long our insurance issue has gone on, I would probably be paying just as much in interest and I have to imagine that a quick ramp up on credit cards to the tune of $4k wouldn't look good to someone assessing our credit score.   This was the right thing for us, right now.  My lenders have worked with me and helped me immensely.  Yes -- it is a business arrangement at the core. One that both parties go into with eyes wide open which is more than I can say for some of those payday loans places.

Meaning yearly interest could be close to 300%.   Though I too have neither borrowed nor given a loan here so far.

Also, I just started at Walmart.  I have had one check so far.  I could show you my schedule?  Also, my next check is going to be just over $300.  I'd like to have a LITTLE room in my next check for gas and various and sundry.  Is there a way I can pay it back $200 a month for 3 months?  I don't know how this all works really so that may be asking a lot.  Thanks for reading!"

I can definitely prove that if requested.  The boyfriend came over one day and got drunk throughout it. I don't know why the time says what it does. I'm positive it was around night and not noon. I've noticed other odd discrepencies as well. There is a comment or two on my account that is utter gibberish in the actual post when searched. There are comments perfectly fine through search which don't exist in my profile. The bulk of comments are gibberish, but certain ones like elaborateexplanation linked aren't. I don't understand why any of this is. Even odder is that previous subs I've posted in have sent me automod messages telling me things like 'be careful to not get scammed.' Usually they do this, but only after you MAKE the post. Not after subsequent edits/deletions. At least in my experience. I don't know how a deleter software could screw up the server time (unless it logs in in a different place?) but that's the only possible way I can think of.  I stand to gain nothing from deleting my history. All the credibility I had on borrow, giftcardexchange, and any other site is erased save for the bots which save transactions/trades. And I would never enter my credentials into a third-party software, so I know it wasn't by me. And to delete each 1 by 1 is nigh impossible in the window of time he had (5 minutes absolute maximum).  And now more than ever I actually wanted to have that history (starting a small business in Baltimore). The credit could have only helped w/ Redditors."

There are a lot of third party apps that will ""log in using reddit"" and if you're already logged into your reddit account, it wouldn't ask for a password. Have you checked your browser history?  I noticed on the link that /u/GreyWalker posted that if you click the ""7 comments"" link and view the whole post, it says ""edited 4 days ago"" despite being 3 months old and the message body has been replaced by gibberish. I used Google to find more of your past posts, and they are the same... ""Edited 4 days ago"" and the body replaced by gibberish before being deleted.  This is consistent with how Red Wipe operates.    If you haven't changed your password, do so now and make it strong. Anyone paying attention knows you're a well known lender here, which means you receive a lot of personal info from users. While unlikely, this could target you for hacking.   You should also contact admins ASAP. They will be able to look at logs and get you more information, such as IP addresses. I don't know if they can restore old posts, but it's worth asking."

Paypal is very buyer-friendly (lenders = buyers in this case) and it's stupid easy to open and win a dispute as a buyer. Which is why I'd never use paypal if I was trying to sell something ;)"

borrow,3bmwrr,Letsaskyou,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:43:49 2015 UTC,Yes exactly. I'd prefer to send it as a service no address required(so I can't use the dispute process) with extra money to cover the fees so I can still get the cash back and 6 months to pay BUT if the lender is uncomfortable with that idea I will send it as gift and deal with the interest on paypals end.  I figured this is more likely to get me a willing lender than asking someone to wait until the 3rd for me to pay them from my paycheck.

borrow,3b9ara,black_shaka,3,Sat Jun 27 05:07:24 2015 UTC,The reimbursements have already been approved but now they go through some insane internal loop de loop process with the insurance company before it gets to the check writing phase.  I have received reimbursement for month #1 and waiting on month 2 and 3 (already approved) to trickle in.   That is why the number is high but realistically I can pay back what I owe with one paycheck and still have money to spare.  These loans are giving me some breathing room while I have been out the $6k that the insurance company owes me.  Hope that helps. I would certainly share the exact numbers on my paycheck privately. Thanks!

I'd like to reassure everyone that I have worked with mamadex26 on multiple occasions and have had nothing but pleasant dealings with them. I completely understand that the frequency of requests and current total can be viewed as a major concern, but that's life, sometimes things don't always pan out the way you'd like - I am very satisfied that they will be able to repay the their outstanding balances by the due dates.  Whilst respecting their privacy, a little info on Mamadex26, they are employed by a large multinational tech company at a senior level. mamadex has held numerous positions over the last 15 or so years within their relevant field (easily obtained from linkedIn), I have more than enough information which I am comfortable with; including FSA information, most recent  paystubs (3 in total - April, May, June), IDs and 2 selfies holding their ID.   I'm not sure what other lender are charging as interest, but to date, on average our completed loans have been about 13.5%, and I have offered mamadex a flat rate of 10% in the past, which they have never taken up. I really do hope things turn around for mamadex, but I am assured they can pay back the loan with ease. If not, I will be requesting some loans in the near future.....joking!   Again thanks for the vigilance, I really do appreciate it!"

I know that the lenders in the sub are still working on finding the right balance that assures them that someone is a reputable borrower. I know that some of my posts caused concerns or red flags.  All completely understandable.    I am completely transparent with my lenders about my current situation.  I make more than enough per year to cover all my usual expenses and still do all the fun usual stuff with my family.  This change in insurance reimbursement threw me for a gigantic loop and quickly drained every penny of my savings/emergency savings.    I don't want to get on a soapbox but anyone that has dealt with autism and insurance will know that it is woefully underfunded and far too easy for insurance companies to try and filter out with some creative coding.  I have fought hard for the 80% reimbursement and if the insurance company thought a little process snafu would deter me, they were wrong. I turned into their worst nightmare as a customer.   But I digress.  This sub and lenders like /u/black_shaka and others have literally saved me. Someday I would love to be a lender on here!   So again thank you to the mods and to the lenders.

I ask because GI Bill is dispersed in how many months of benefits you've used (regardless of whether it was partial, half, or full), and not based on units itself.  This allows you to use receive ""more benefit.""   what happens when I don't pay a credit card for two or three months in a row?   At least pay the minimum payment. If you don't you'll default and it goes to collections. I don't know the specific amount of time this process takes. Same goes with the phone company. You'll be sent to collections, and you will spend endless amount of years trying to fix your credit. Not to mention, you might not be able to secure a loan (for school, a house, car, even credit cards) without an insanely high amount of APR.  Yes, your credit card company WILL work with you. You need to call and talk to them though."
borrow,3b0m7p,mmmmaaarrk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"um, no the GI is prorated if a student is not attending full time - if you for example take one 3 credit hour undergraduate 8 or 9 week class - your rate of pursuit/training is 1/2 so for that 8 or 9 week period you would only use one month and maybe a couple of days.  If a student takes one 3 credit hour undergraduate 16 to 19 week class - that is 1/4 rate of pursuit/training so would use approx. one month and a few days.  The monthly payment charts for all GI Bill/VA Education programs are set up with columns for full time, 3/4 time, 1/2 time which determines both the student's monthly payments and how much of the 36 months of entitlement are used during that time period which the VA actually computes by day not month.  Also if a student enrolls in full time load for a semester and the classes don't start until the 15th of that month, only two weeks (1/2 of one month) of entitlement is charged against the 36 month total."
borrow,3b0m7p,SCOveterandretired,0,Fri Jun 26 10:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think I know what you're getting at with the first part, and I'm taking enough credits for this to equate exactly to one semesters worth of credits and span just shy of a full semesters worth of months and weeks. I'm getting full benefits and not wasting any of my GI Bill which is exactly what mattered to me (I have exactly enough left to finish my degree.)  I can't pay the minimum payment, that's basically my point. To pay the minimum payment on all of my cards costs me between $400 and $500 per month and I have $600 that is supposed to last me until I receive student loans. The $600 needs to pay for food, dog food, cat food, cat litter, and other incidentals. It's not nearly enough."

He's curbed his peeing on things and now I'm just watching him even more like a hawk.  It wasn't a bill I had already, it was a request in hopes of getting him fixed.  So I've just been working on new products (blog posts and roundups anyone? lol) to save to have him fixed next month.   .....and if anyone is curious how I got into this hole....lol....I had been working full time for a client for 3 years. One evening I was contacted by his business partner & long time girlfriend to tell me that he (my client) took his own life.  All of the business went to her, but she couldn't afford to pay me full time. So immediately I lost $1500 a month....and this happened right after I spent every penny I had to move.  so.....I'm crawling out of the hole from that sad experience. I still work for the woman, but she hasn't increased how much I can work ( still sitting at part time). So I've been taking on other bloggers and getting involved in other types of writing gigs to climb out of my financial issue.  It was all really sudden and all happened at once.   So yeah....lol I've been having to budget very tightly to make sure everything gets paid and whatnot.  With the new work I'm taking on, it's bringing in more money, which is awesome......but the laptop is dying....and that brings me to here.  And I don't want that to sound like I can't pay or anything.....I can definitely show Chase Quickpay payments and Paypal payments I have received from clients to show that I do actually have an income. lol  I'm just not in a position to pay out a large lump sum at 1 time at the moment.  EDIT -  I started thinking about it and I wanted to add on, that I didn't mean this to be an 'oh woe is me' sob story kinda thing. I meant it as....here's my situation, life through me a curve and I'm working to improve and get back to normal."
