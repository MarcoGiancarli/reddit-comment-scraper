factorio,3e2yna,TehLaziness,10,Tue Jul 21 15:40:04 2015 UTC,Throughput will be hurt quite a bit as you can't have trains travel simultaneously in opposite directions. An East to West train will reserve the same set of blocks as a West to East train. This can be solved by adding space between parallel tracks.

factorio,3e2yna,roy777,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"If you use normal signals a train could enter the loop and stop partway through, leading to possible deadlocks. With chain signals, if the exit it wants is unavailable, it will wait before entering the loop until the blocking traffic has cleared the path."
factorio,3e2yna,istasber,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:54:43 2015 UTC,I've never made adjacent train tracks that had no space between them. If they show as a single block shouldn't that be reported as a bug?
factorio,3e2yna,roy777,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:35 2015 UTC,"It's not that they show as the same block because they are close together, it's just that there are fewer places to put extra chain signals in order to split the blocks up more.  If you had a single space between the tracks, you could break the crossing in the center from one block into something like 9 or 16 blocks by adding signals, so that east-bound and west-bound (or north-bound and south-bound) trains can travel past each other at the same time."
factorio,3e2yna,istasber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh great point, thanks!"
factorio,3e2yna,yeganer,6,Tue Jul 21 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like all of the intermediate signals should be chain signals to prevent deadlocks, depending on the length of the train. It'd be better to stop before entering the intersection than in the middle of it somewhere, and risk blocking trains trying to exit.  edit: I suppose it doesn't make a difference, thinking about it more. If the exit is blocked, your train system is backed up somewhere else, and so it probably doesn't matter what you do here."
factorio,3e2yna,istasber,5,Tue Jul 21 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"i noticed some missing chain signals, too  not all signals need to be chain signals, but some definitely need it. general rule of thum is, if it's crossing something put a chain signal in front.  for best results, dont use signals right at the exit but place the signals at least one train length away from the crossing"
factorio,3e2yna,roy777,3,Tue Jul 21 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"I gave it some further thought, and I a more general rule of thumb using chain signals in a compact interchange like this is to not really think about using them to make the fastest possible interchange, but instead, to limit how long trains wait to enter the intersection (over the same design that only has signals on the entrances/exits).  If you make all of the internal signals chain signals, trains should only ever stop before entering the intersection, and there should never be any deadlocks, just as though you only had signals on the exits/enterances. The main benefit with chain signals before and after each intersecting track is that trains wouldn't have to wait until the other train had completely exited the interchange before heading through."

factorio,3e2yna,Senacharim,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"Chain signals were added in 0.12. They are only green when the signal into the next block on the trains path is green.  They are used to keep trains from entering intersections until the way out is clear, helping to prevent deadlocks."
factorio,3e2yna,DeamonEngineer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"Ah. Thank you, I haven't got the update yet.   Normally, I just use fewer signals with better placement."
factorio,3e2yna,roy777,3,Wed Jul 22 02:35:57 2015 UTC,no pre signal needed on the entrance of the 4 way a standard signal will product the same effect other than that looks good.  personaly i dont like the 0 spacing track in my opinion it limits what you can do with trains
factorio,3e2yna,istasber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a normal signal mean a train might move partially into the intersection and then stop at the first chain signal it meets if there is no further path, thus blocking the intersection while it waits?"
factorio,3e2yna,Tallinu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:07 2015 UTC,"You are right.  With less compact designs, like the one /u/repkap11 posted, you can get away with a regular signal at the entrance without risking any blockages."
factorio,3e2yna,roy777,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:19 2015 UTC,"You definitely want everything except the four exits to be chain signals here to avoid all situations in which a train could enter the junction without actually being able to exit. Other than that, people have already pointed out that N/S or E/W traffic can't pass simultaneously even though they wouldn't collide due to the center being all one block. Just separating the parallel tracks by one rail tile would allow the insertion of signals breaking that into four blocks which would be sufficient to allow trains to pass each other. You'll probably need to do something to segregate the forking / merging points along those tracks, because the overlapping curved rails make those into single blocks as well. The narrowest I've been able to manage is two rail-tile separation between tracks, and even then it required odd positioning of the crossing turns, and often shifting the non-crossing turns back several tiles to make room for other signals... Here's one of the more interesting results, although it could be made a bit more compact I think: http://imgur.com/a/CxXxd#erVkYJN The goal with that one was maximum traffic flow in a reasonable space rather than minimal size."

factorio,3e2yna,Tallinu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't the ""inner"" signals also be pre signals?"
factorio,3e2yna,EurypteriD192,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see why. The pre-signal only should be used to prevent trains from getting into a track that has no definitive exit for them. If they're already in the loop, it's been decided that there's an exit. The inner signals are only there to stop a train on the ring from smacking into one that's currently entering the ring."

factorio,3e4rv9,billwoo,3,Tue Jul 21 23:16:58 2015 UTC,"If you mean smart inserters, you should be able to do it the same way. There's a slight change when placing wire, though - if you have more wire, it continues trying to place wire from the last point you clicked on. And if you click things in the old sequence - power pole, inserter, power pole, chest, for example - you end up performing the sequence which removes the wire connection between the inserter and power pole. Putting the wire away with Q will cancel making further connections though. So you either have to start by clicking the inserter, then the pole, then the chest (then pressing Q if you have more wire), or you do pole, inserter, Q, pull wire out again, pole, chest (Q). You can also connect a single wire directly between the inserter and the chest if they're close enough together."

factorio,3e4rv9,TheSoCalled,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:17:09 2015 UTC,Mine looks like that if I try to connect to a pole that's too far away - could you try putting the pole closer and seeing it that helps?
