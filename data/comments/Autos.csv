The GT3 RS is an FIA GT3 class car and they never ran at LeMans.  LeMans is governed by the ACO and they have a whole different set of rules and the GT3 RSR is the car that ran there and in the ALMS and WEC and other ACO endurance championships.  In both cases I'm talking 997 since the car you posted is an FIA 997 GT3 RS.  In either case they certainly made much more than 4 of them since many teams around the world have raced them over the years (both FIA and ACO series.)  I have personally touched more than 4 of them (I work in pro endurance racing.)  The GT3 RS and the RSR look very similar but if you look closely you can spot some of the differences.  The aero packages are different, most notably the vents on the front fenders on the FIA cars aren't allowed on the LeMans cars.  There are many more differences as well, such as ABS is allowed in GT3 but not GTLM (the ACO class.)  (Edited due to brain fart.  I just crossed out the error so subsequent posts would make sense.)"
