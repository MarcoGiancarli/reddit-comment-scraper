Or a state of the art Main Battle tank.  The industrial depth one needs for that is rediculously deep.  Hell, most nations on earth can't even afford to MAINTAIN a carrier group, let alone design and build one.  There are many reasons they aren't ubiquitous, and those reasons are being ignored right and left.    Tech wank.  So much tech wank.  I have spoken in IRC before about Railguns, and there is a LARGE number of people here, mostly from season one, who seem to think they are an unstoppable killing weapon.  They aren't.  I already have a design to counter them, and I'll be building it as soon as I have the tech for it.  But see, that last bit was the catch...  I have to develop the tech for it.  So do you.  You don't go from being an unstable war torn shitpile of a country to making MBT's and advanced composite body armor in the 15 years we have been in charge, in game.  That's insanely unrealistic.  Especially since most who have done this sort of thing haven't posted one thing about building and funding research labs, or industrial development, or anything else.  Just ""Gib guns, plox!"".  And yes, global politics.  You know who should have come to Pakistans aid, diplomatically, to try to resolve this crisis?  Whichever one of the US nations that most resembles the former USA.  You know what country, which split apart for valid reasons that are not going to be changed because of a single political party, would NOT be striving to reunite seperate pieces with their own cultures and relgions?

The moment the gas hits the soldiers lungs, the night sky begins to light up with gunfire. An evacuation of the nearby city is completed very quickly, with very few civilians being affected by the gas. The battle ends forty two minutes and seventeen seconds after it began when a strong breeze rushes through the military camp, sweeping away the gas.

If the Carolinas wanted out of the Confederacy that had nothing to do with the Eastern States' involvement, but was a result of the Confederates' greed over the region. And such a statement accusing the Eastern American government of murder and bribes is horrendously belligerent to any politicians in the Union of New York and North Jersey. It is true that some politicians gave money to a political action committee, however this was not the Eastern States government acting but rather a result of individual freedom that the American government provides.

Everybody's playing Marysueistan.  It's one of the reasons I mourn the decline of the deliberate bad guys in this game. They tended to understand they weren't going to win everything and that other countries would hate their country. A lot of players seem to take both of those things very personally."

worldpowers,3dzjps,Joshmofo1,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:50 2015 UTC,My favorite part of the thread in question is where people try to convince Dioteren to meta game to help Pakistan by using meta arguments and complains to try and shift his IC actions. Was beautiful.   The fact of the matter is that good players will realize that helping India while perhaps morally wrong helps place your nation in a position of power and influence rather than helping a losing Pakistan.
worldpowers,3dzjps,Alexander___Hamilton,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"It's true. Because when players are allowed to abuse RNG and then nothing is done by mods, it created an air of unprofessionalism and makes players hostile because there are players being punished for abusing the system, and then other players not (see the first three posts linked), people get pretty fucking angry. And then when you modmail the mods about it and they still fail to do anything about it, it pisses people off.

Just because it spent most of it's time as a top secret does not mean that's how long it takes to develop.
worldpowers,3e1bmb,Dragon029,2,Tue Jul 21 12:45:15 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the real life F-22, it took way longer than that - the proposal occurred in 1986, it took 4 years to bring together a tech demo (incapable of any form of combat), another 6 years to turn that tech demo into the production aircraft, with the F-22 firing it's first missile in 2000. From the USAF identifying that it wanted a new fighter to having the F-22 enter service took 24 years."

Your both incorrect but it's not worth arguing because some mod who thinks they are an expert isn't going to change anything because that'd be admitting they were wrong, and that never happens."

We are Angola, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Dahomey, Dongo, Ghana, The Ivory Coast, Niger, the United Equatorial Republic, and Zambia.  I think saying we're all pointed at one international goal is giving us too much credit. We each have our own agenda and about the only thing we completely agree on is that we want shared security and shared economic growth. We're still eight players playing separate countries."

worldpowers,3dwyff,BSGIII,9,Mon Jul 20 05:40:19 2015 UTC,"Look I know and I understand most of your concerns, but I want to try and draw another angle on this issue.   Josh has been telegraphing everything in game big time. Everything. India invaded Bangladesh, once half of Pakistan. Pakistan should have taken advantage of the situation, should have pressed for Bangladeshi independence and international pressure.   It didn't.   India became a Fascist dictatorship in a coup and stated a nationalistic goal of reunification. Pakistan made a speech on the matter, but failed to take further action.   If there is any country in the world which should have been preparing itself for an invasion, it was Pakistan. If there was any country in the world that should have been fortifying the border, expanding the military, and seeking to reaffirm alliances with it's neighbours.   Besides from a submarine purchase and extremely limited fighter procurement, you did little.   And now you are paying the price for it. Because the main reason why nothing is being done to help you is not that no one feels sympathetic, but because your military position is untenable. To most, the defeat of Pakistan is now just a formality, and one that will occur before the year is out. If that were different, if people felt that their own invovlement could sway the tide, then they would be more willing to act.   In the Indonesian situation, I knew the risks. I knew full well the world would stand against me, and I accounted for it. While some betrayals caught me flat footed (like Trojan Horse, which was admitted to be more about breaking up the Triple Pact and preventing an unbalancing power bloc in game then what would have been best for the Caliexican government), and even with most of the world turning against it, the DFE remained untenable to invade.   You can come back. But it willl require a more applied and pragmatic strategy then you have at the moment."
worldpowers,3dwyff,Forrestal,5,Mon Jul 20 07:10:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I had plans for doing most of these things, I'm just didn't quite have  adequate time, taking into account IRL concerns. In reality, 'Hindustan United' has only been predominate for a matter of two weeks or so now, and I have had quite the busy work schedule. Also, I think I might have made a post supporting the restoration of the Bangladeshi monarch some time ago, although I could be wrong (I might have ultimately forgot to post it).  You make a valid point, and I'm not acting as though I had absolutely no time whatsoever, but IIRC, in the IRC josh stated he was going to be busy this upcoming week, so I wasn't too worried about pushing out preparation posts too quickly. But obviously, it didn't go down like that. But you're right, better safe than sorry."
worldpowers,3dwyff,ishaan_singh,6,Mon Jul 20 07:27:57 2015 UTC,"I feel for you. You built a country and now someone gets to take away that very country you've spent hundreds of hours building. But, powerful countries have invaded smaller countries and had their ways with them.  Pakistan is to be taken seriously IRL, no similar compulsion exists in-game however. You don't have your biggest deterrents, nukes. Pakistan has powerful Arab friends only because Pakistan is the only Islamic country with nukes. But, in-game you have had nothing for Arabs or any other Muslim country to care for you. You have one of the biggest Muslim population, true, but so does India. And, India is in-game is vastly more powerful and diplomatic than Pakistan. India would also be largest consumer of energy in world. China is rekt, USA is divided, by far India would be gobbling up world's energy supplies. This is something not be taken lightly.  I do accept what's happening is 'laughably unrealistic', but that precedes the point. The point I am trying to make is, in the universe that may be worldpowers, you weren't prepared enough for aggression. Even though it was obvious where it was heading, no preparations were made.  As for the help you've been receiving, while you may feel thankful, that help itself does nothing to actually help you. A quick look at your wiki tells me Pakistan has had no experience with fifth generation fighters, how in the world your pilots would be able to fly the fighters gifted to you is best left to imagination. Not to mention, how would ever UK or others accomplish flying in so much equipment in such short duration."

worldpowers,3dwyff,aer-o,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"First off i'm sorry that you feel this way. But let me give you my side  I look out for my country first and foremost. Everything else comes second. My look on this war is that Pakistan is in a position where relations where not upheld. Pakistan lacks allies that will fight. Because of this Pakistan was obviously in the losing position even if I had entered the fray it was still the losing position. So the obvious choice to stay neutral at the beginning was made. When I requested entrance into Trident I realized that since you wouldn't be around to ally with I would need ""new friends"" Trident was the obvious choice. We share similar economic stability for the most part and we all have important ports and items for trade. Originally I never wanted those subs in my waters to begin with. But I agreed since you said IRL Saudi would do it. So the plan was simple. I open my waters to medical ships and such to provide you cover into the water. The Navy's of India would not dare hunt in my waters with Medical ships in the area. But as trollme decided he gave you a roll which revealed to the navy which direction the subs had headed. So the only option now to get out of any possible hot water and avoid conflict with the medical ships in the area was to buy it off of you. Which I promised to sell back to you for less then what I bought it. And yes I traded with India. Why? Because Pakistan is at or is about to hit the point of no return in this war. And when that happens I would have lost what you called my butt buddy. So I needed weapons (Gideon Swords) that would be able to defend me. I again am sorry but I have to protect my country, my people, and my economy before I intervene in a war where hope is slim to known.   I did what I thought was best for my country. I am sorry that you are upset about that but at the time you where not the winning side."

worldpowers,3dwyff,aer-o,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:24:14 2015 UTC,If India attacked Saudi Arabia it could also potentially turn the tables as much of the Muslim world could rally round Saudi Arabia as a cause for action against India.

Heck India might have to make repetitions or potentially lose perhaps Bangladesh. I could imagine what an uproar it'd be.

worldpowers,3dwyff,aer-o,2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:09 2015 UTC,"There would definitely be riots, especially if Iran was supporting the Indians. It would be an uproar in Iranian society. Terrorists could also potentially form, calling for the liberation of the oppressed Muslims controlled by India."
worldpowers,3dwyff,Diotoiren,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yup! There's already a fair amount of ethnic tension which can break out into momentary localized vigilante wars in both nations, however it'd be a hell storm for Iran. It'd be like the Israel of the East in many respects geopolitically and religiously.  Honestly the British in my opinion screwed India over by breakin it up into two and eventually becomin three different states.

To say that we are going to lose this war justifies new relations is borderline metagaming. While yes, I'm sure Saudi IG would have some idea that Pakistan's chances were slim, that wouldn't stop them, I'm pretty sure most of this notion that I'm going to lose stems from META.   Now, I understand the need for allies and all, but don't you think you could've, at the very, very least, held off until I lost the war, it kinda circles back to metagaming. And also, not to mention, there are other nations to ally with, although this isn't really a concern for me.   I just wished you would've stayed neutral until the end, and then pursued relations, what harm is there in that, and it makes for a totally believable scenario, as opposed to the complete 180 pulled by the Saudi government.   However, despite all this, I do appreciate you taking this lightly. I admit I was probably a little harsh, and I apologize. I think you're overall a good player."
worldpowers,3dwyff,Joshmofo1,-3,Mon Jul 20 06:11:23 2015 UTC,There is a different leader in Saudi literally the older king is practically dead leaving daughter and husband as the new. If you had wanted me to stay neutral until the end of the war then we wouldn't have tried to sneak subs into my water.   I do hope you stick around to maybe rebuild Pakistan though.
worldpowers,3dwyff,BroseppeVerdi,2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:24 2015 UTC,"Bro…first I'd just say take a step back, a breather. It's difficult when your stuck in the position Pakistan (IG) is stuck in both strategically and militarily. I really can't speak for anyone else, but I completely get what your sayin. The shear amount of outnumbered/outclassed forces being attacked on all fronts almost guarantees a victory of some sort to the attacker. The battle mechanic is rather messy when it comes to certain situations (such as this war). Honestly man, It's a bit strange sometimes. I've sent troops abroad to help fight in limited roles in African wars but it continuously got invalidated. I'm not sure why the same hadn't happened here. Also the fact that tens of thousands (and potentially hundreds of thousands more) Indochinese will eventually die as most countries tend to fight as hard as they can during their last stands rather than simply roll over should spur massive anti war protests. Like you said in Crimea, and the Ukrainian Civil War, simply a few hundred Russian troops returned home in body bags and that spurred decent sized protests in some cities throughout Russia.  The whole WP in real life balance/situation is somethin I completely get. I went through (albeit not exactly) but similar phase as to what your probably goin through with the Panama crisis. Its the feelin that you can't really do anythin because the enemy forces are to strong and to advanced for you, or that none of your strategic allies will help. Also many allies would likely retract their support from India as they are on the offensive, and you should get aid immediately as your on the defensive, however this ain't the case no more for (whatever reason?). Especially in the realm of religious conflict, I doubt even if we tried very hard to get rid of it, it'll still be round in much of the world, and still relatively strong in the whole Indian-Pakistani situation. You really did nothin to provoke the attack either. Guatemala is effectively a country no one has ever heard of before with a tiny economy, I would contribute much more if I could, but I simply lack to assets or resources to replace them if I sent more stuff…(I could supply you with a crap ton of A-37's if you want though xD :P) and I'll cover the bill (lots of profit at the London Arms Expo en such) anyways that ain't relevant right now. We're talkin bout you and WP as a whole. Personally I've had a major issue with this as well, the Arab World should've rallied at least to some extent behind you, provided at least military-aid, if not actual assets (whether it be Air/Land/Sea), as it'd be an encroachment onto Muslim lands etc etc. Instead you have to have secretly have planes sent to you by nations (literally) half a world away.  Anyways at this point I don't want to make it to long that you'll fall asleep readin this xD but if you ever need help with military strategy or acquisition just message me. I can usually provide a solution to most problems both practical and logistical. I'll see what other assets I can free up to send to you. IG Guatemala's current government's big thing has been 'standin up for the lil guy'. Heck at the rate things are goin it'd be fully justified if I sent my military to help assist you all because we have say 1 tariff agreement. Anyways, if you need a break take one, I'm sure we can 'pause' the offensives en stuff for a while, and if not I suppose someone else can temporarily be a 2IC for you or somethin. Don't let WP get to you, its quite different than irl and the shadowboxin & open war that happens irl, or in WP are rather different respectively. Take care man, if you do choose to leave WP at least become a 2IC for someone or heck come visit Central America nothin that bad really happens round here :)! But really, your doin just fine and its the other players that have made this rather unreal. :(   Edit: Since Latin America has historically been the place where politically exiled leaders go, and the sort I'd like your government and military stay in Guatemala…as thats what we do, desecrate service to all of those political types :)"

Something people in this game need to be reminded of constantly, it would seem, is that what people say is often deliberately not what they mean. /u/BSGIII, when I made this post the other day, it was pure and unadulterated bullshit demagoguery. It was a politician lying to his people because he knew they'd buy it. It was pathos trumping logos. It was Colin Powell standing in front of the UN going ""BUT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THO"". That post, and posts like it made in the buildup of this war, represent something that happens quite often in global politics: Bullshit pretense.  With regards to how this storyline is going down: India has no intention of relinquishing Pakistan. India sees no distinction between ""Indian"" and ""Pakistani"", and views the Partition of 1947 as a grave mistake that needs to be rectified. It's not a matter of ""Pakistan is a bunch of savages living under Sharia law, they need India to come and clean up"" (on a side note: In the post above, I meant to refer to your leadership as ""savages"", not your entire people), it's ""India is sorry it treated it's Muslim population so bad.

India is definitely on the Russian end of the spectrum here.

worldpowers,3dwjav,Delta_Sigma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:20:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Right now they're gettin sandwiched between the Iranians and the Indians. I'd say if they're best bet at this point is to play the Indians and Iranians off against each other and endure the other to attack each other while regrouping their forces and rebuilding in what short while they have. They should also begin to think long term insurgency style resistance. If they won't be able to win against the vastly superior Indian military and (for some reason Indochina, HK, and Sri Lanka joined the fray), then they got to go Vietcong on them. Honestly somethin like this wouldn't really happen in real life because once again the international community would get behind Pakistan for the most part and the Indians would get shreked. Only a two countries (Guatemala and I believe Pennsylvania) are sanctioning India. It'd be much different in real life. Well…thats somewhat arguable but there'd be a lot more open support for Pakistan."

The purges failed. The Wassoulou Federation is democratic only at a Federation level. We do not and can not dictate the form of government inside of signatory states.   That being said, the people of Angola & Protectorates are deeply concerned about the state of affairs inside of Ghana and the purges.

We can assure you that, once we get to forming a UCC, Angola will definitely advocate that murder be a Federation crime, addressable by Federation police.  Angola does not object to Rozwi military build-up. Even while we find it concerning, we recognize both the Rozwi Republic and Ghana's right to self-defense. We objected specifically to tanks as a weapon of invasion, not defense and in Rozwi's particular geographic position.

So the government proposes a new idea of placing the cross of Kongo between the flag of Equatorial Guinea and Western Congo on the normal flag.

worldpowers,3dt6zc,BSGIII,3,Sun Jul 19 05:33:09 2015 UTC,It's okay Pakistan. You have the support of the People's Republic of Yunnan.
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,2,Sun Jul 19 05:55:35 2015 UTC,This support is appreciated. We are forever grateful.
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:06:49 2015 UTC,"We are dissapointed in Yunnan, to say the least; we had helped to secure your indepedence from China, pledged to protect your nation whilst you were defenseless, were responsible for your entry into ASEAN, and had provided your nation with free weaponry when it was announced that Yunnan would be forming an armed force."
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:38:56 2015 UTC,"We are also disappointing in Indochina for supporting India's warmongering in the region for practically no reason whatsoever. India has murdered over 100,000 innocent people and many more soldiers of Pakistan simply because they want to. Why would you ever support a nation who does that? It makes no sense."
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:56:21 2015 UTC,[M] ASEAN was done under the previous claimant; it's an economic economic cooperation treaty. There have been no meetings.
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"[M] Okay. But still, why in gods name would you support India?"
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Brubndubn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"[M] My closest ally; I had one of two feasible options. First, do nothing and take flak from both sides (India for not supporting them, everybody else for not demanding India to stop). Second, support them, and not take flak from India, but still take flak from others. The second is preferred."
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:04:22 2015 UTC,[M] It's better to do nothing than support them militarily.
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:56 2015 UTC,"[M] Like I said, it was either flak from one side, or flak from both. I'd honestly prefer flak from only one, particularly since the other is my biggest trading partner."
worldpowers,3dt6zc,Minihawking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:08:57 2015 UTC,[M] People won't give you flak for staying neutral in a war.
