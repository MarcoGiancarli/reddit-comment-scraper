Nixon and his staff were only meeting with representatives of the South Vietnamese government. Even though he was doing so with the intent to keep the war going, he was actually doing nothing illegal. There's no law that says you can't meet with an ambassador of an allied country and convince him to urge his government to keep fighting a war.   Where this would really play out is in the 1968 election. It was already a tight race so this would have swung the election hard in favor of Humphrey.

As far as I can tell, the US and UK just wanted all the fascists and communists to kill each other off.   Here's my take on what might happen had the Normandy landings never taken place. I'll also assume that the Pacific War doesn't change much except at the very end. Note that when I say ""Allies,"" I mean the US, UK and Free French and not Russia. The Anglo-American alliance has worked their way up through Italy as they did in the OTL. The difference is that they have even larger numbers of both men and equipment that would otherwise have been in southern England waiting to go into France. I'd put the date at January, 1944 rather than June. From here, they roll up into Northern Italy and drive towards Marseille. A smaller invasion forces sets out from the UK to liberate Norway and takes Oslo by the end of 1944.   By mid-1945, the Allies have captured Marseille and the Red Army is closing in on Berlin. The Germans recall nearly all of their forces to defend the Fatherland. The Allies send a small army to take Greece while de Gaulle and the Free French Army, as well as other armies in exile, make an unopposed landing at Calais and march on Paris then take the Low Countries without much resistance. With France secured, the Allies take Yugoslavia. In early 1946, the Russians take Berlin and begin rooting out the last pockets of resistance while German deserters and intellectuals flee to Allied lines.   Here's where the Pacific War diverges. With Russia tied up longer in Europe, they don't invade Manchuria. The atomic bombs are dropped and Japan surrenders. The US is then able to occupy the entire Korean Peninsula. In China, the civil war resumes and ends in a communist victory but lasts longer because they receive no help from Russia.   So, our new Cold War map now has Germany entirely communist. Korea is also undivided under a pro-US government. Yugoslavia is also pro-Western and becomes the site of multiple insurgencies, government crackdowns and civil wars."

Without him, those favoring strong centralization lose to the federalists. Gran Colombia has no powerful national government, but this also means its constituent states have less cause to secede.  Lacking a strongman president, Gran Colombia looks to Spain like a good target for reconquering. Spain loses this war, but not before enhancing the national identity of the young nation, which called up soldiers from all its states to protect itself.  Aside from national defense, the national government has little major responsibilities. It's most significant power is in facilitating commerce; the roads it builds through the 1830s do much to endear it to the regular people. It's also popular with big business.  In 1842, Colombia and the USA agree to construct a great canal to connect the Pacific and Caribbean across the Isthmus of Panama. In exchange for financing the USA obtains the right to use the Panama Canal free for 100 years after its completion. Empowering Gran Colombia fits the Monroe Doctrine nicely, and GC is happy for the financial aid. Work proceeds with primitive steam shovels and a massive labor force of poor workers.  The project becomes a series of delays and disasters. Thousands of workers die every year in its construction to accidents and disease. For the USA, the experiment must continue. It has become a rare point of agreement for the North and the South, as Northern manufacturers and Southern plantation owners believe the Canal will open Asian markets to American goods in a huge way. Not to mention the Northern equipment manufacturers, who happily collect government checks and look the other way when it comes to the thousands of ""contract laborers"" who are taken from Caribbean nations to provide cheap labor on the project.   In Gran Colombia, the project is a point of national pride that also happens to line the pockets of most politicians with American dollars. Colombians tend to get better jobs than the Caribbean blacks, so the Canal becomes a way to enter the growing middle class.  The Panama Canal is finally completed in 1863. Against the arguments of many, it has been completed as a sea-level canal, obviating the need for locks. It is tremendous demand immediately, and wealth flows to Gran Colombia."

Remember that the French were very concerned with slave revolts, such as the revolt in Haiti, and had been training towards shutting down those rebellions, not fighting a war. On the flip side, Southerners were afraid that the French would try and free their slaves, and so would be very supportive of military action against France in North America. The Federalists also would have supported an alliance with Great Britain, though I can't speculate on whether that would work just 20 years after the American Revolution.

Where is your point of departure?  Does Japan still get to invade China and Korea and do it's ethnic cleansing?  Or does Japan just muddle through the 1930's and eventually recover, sometime in the '50s or '60s?  What about Germany?  Does it remain permanently economically depressed, with a mostly-disfunctional republic government, but no National Socialist Party to unite the country and focus the economy?  Does the Soviet Union still struggle under 5-year plans that fail to actually create the workers paradise?  Or does Stalin, with no external enemy to fight, do a Chaiman Mao and institute policies that cause millions of Russian peasants to starve to death?  Or does he just kill them for being disloyal?  For that matter, will the United States muddle through with no economic focus, and eventually become some kind of world economic player, but not nearly as powerful as it did?  I imagine Great Britain will have plenty more resources to focus on keeping the Raj in India, so independence never happens.  But the British will be fighting a decades-long civil unrest in India.  Will the British turn to policies of deliberate starvation to make the Indian population less unruly?  So, after WW2 several technologies and people came together to cause the Green Revolution.  A huge manufacturing and chemical industry had arisen, partly due to the war demand of WW2, that produced great tractors and fertilizers and pesticides.  Adding petroleum, in the form of applied fertilizers has a huge increase in the amount of calories per acre you can obtain.  That is why a fully industrialized (hybrid seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, mechanical planters, harvesters, etc) farmer in Iowa can produce 3742 kilograms of corn per acre per year.  That yields about 1,360,000 food calories.  Now, most of that corn goes to feed chicken, pigs and cattle, so the human-intake calories is much less, but if it were all converted into corn muffins and corn syrup it could provide enough calories to power about 350 active men.  (This is horribly bad nutritional math, because you can't just survive on corn meal alone, you need better nutrition, but this is a thumbnail illustration.)  So, with lots of petroleum and mechanical and biotech inputs, one acre of (well watered) land can feed 350 people per year.  In the 1930's this number was much lower.  Agriculture was much less efficient - the yearly output of one acre of land could feed about 20 people per year.  So the Green Revolution allowed about an 13-fold increase in the (theoretical) amount of people that could be supported.  Now this is again, Bad Math.  Because not all farmland is equal, and not all crops respond to petroleum-based inputs the same way, and so on.  So, going into more Bad Math, if the world population in 1930 was about 2 billion, and we wave a magic wand, and there are no more mass-killing type things (like wars or genocides) for the rest of the 20th century, and we can magically do the green revolution 13-fold increase in productivity to all farmland everywhere, then we get ...  26 billion people.  Well, that's utter rubbish for an answer.  Told you it was Bad Math."

Who is to say that slave labor, once less men in the fields were needed, wouldn't simply be shifted to other areas, such as working in factories?  Many factory owners in the North were always trying to find how to spend the least amount of money on their workers while manufacturing as much as possible.  People in the North knew that if they didn't work, there was always somebody waiting to take their place, and that allowed for factory owners to mistreat them.  Imagine if instead of the potential replacement being a poor immigrant who would work for less, if instead it was someone who would be bought by the owner and would work for literally nothing, and they couldn't do anything about it?  People would work for even less then.  Unless the federal government came in and stopped the practice of slavery, it most likely wouldn't have phased out easily or very well.

Ignoring that Europe really didn't have the need, interest, or resources to colonize across the atlantic a century before Columbus it can be safely assumed that plague events would retard any exploration unless people thought there was a cure across the sea.   The 14th century Plague outbreak is credited with a high of 60% of Europe's population dead whereas Smallpox is sometimes credited with wiping out 90% of central and south americans.   It's possible that without another century of growth the population of the americas is smaller and therefore less susceptible to plagues.

While that was the most notorious epidemic, there were major bubonic plague epidemics for hundreds of years after first contact with the New World, and the plague played a significant role in devastating native populations for centuries in the Americas in real history.  So you're probably talking about European colonization of the Americas starting around 1350. Plague aside, this is very problematic due to all the major players involved being at very different points in their history.   Spain and Portugal, for example, were a collection of smaller kingdoms fighting among each other, in addition to fighting Islamic powers on the Iberian peninsula. At this point, they have only recently begun exploring/colonizing island chains off the African coast, like the Canary Islands. The African coast beyond Morocco was unknown. The best-case scenario would be a random ship miraculously surviving being blown off course across the Atlantic and the crew then promptly dying or killed upon reaching the New World, before ever having any hope of returning to Europe.  TLDR: Intentional European exploration to the Americas, especially state sanctioned voyages, would be pretty inconceivable in 1350. It would be very roughly like the U.S. space program deciding in 1969 to send astronauts to Pluto instead of the Moon first. The most basic historical, political, and technological contexts aren't in place for such a thing to happen.  So no, colonization would have been ineffective."

Maybe they are test subjects like guinea pigs or lab rats and not sentient sapient life forms?   UFO encounters and close encounters skyrocket. Originally keeping files on this stuff for paranoid Cold War reasons, World governments begin to seriously examine the possibility that citizens of Earth are routinely being visited and examined by extraterrestrial visitors.   Soviets express total incredulity/claim to have their own spaceship. It would take a while to realize the technology is indecipherable so until then it would be the hottest thing on the planet for scientists and governments. Eventually the scraps would become collectors items for insanely rich people and museums. Perhaps mimicking moon rocks as gifts for foreign diplomacy.  The biggest question would be where they came from. Probes to nearby planets become greater priorities of space exploration. I assume we don't find them on the dark side of the moon or one of the moons of Jupiter or orbiting Venus or whatever so programs like SETI get much more funding, which isn't saying a lot but nevertheless. It might be doubly discouraging though, to get no response when the evidence that you should or could is staring you in the face.   Religion is tricky but even the Vatican has come to admit that extraterrestrials don't directly contradict scripture. Many, well, some Native American belief-systems have adopted fringe culture mysticism like crystal energy, cryptozoology, alternative medicine, and ufology/space aliens as part of their culture. Hindu religion has properly sci-fi'd itself in the modern age with ancient flying machines and multiple births and deaths of billion year old universes. I am not confident on my understanding of the relationship between practitioners of Islam and Extraterrestrials. In the junk science world Islam is pretty infamous for a perceived downward slide into pseudoscience usually highlighted by texts suggesting Djinn should be captured and harvested as sources of holy alternative energy.   Unless their biology is also indecipherable it would be invaluable for our understanding of everything organic. After all, as Carl Sagan once said : ""...our biologists are profoundly limited. They study only a single kind of biology..."" It could blow the doors off modern medicine. Still, in the 1950s the technology we take for granted today is in its early years or still mostly theoretical. Samples might degrade by the time we could study them to today's standards. Still, those folks got it done back them so I don't doubt there would be huge advances in science and technology just from trying to study the remains of the creatures and of the ship.  Knowing that they exist would resolve a lot of questions but it still wouldn't solve many of the paradoxes surrounding the question of extraterrestrial life, mainly: ""why wont they talk to us?"""

His successor (we'll go ahead and call him Abu Bakr) takes on the huge task of fighting the Romans. The first target is Mesopotamia. Abu Bakr conquers the southern part of the region which is not under Rome's control. Eventually, war with Rome comes either through Abu Bakr's doing or a Roman preemptive strike. The Empire is too well organized, too well equipped and too well trained and they've got more than enough in numbers to match the Muslims.

This could possibly see the Allies threaten Hitler into backing off or even go to war, confident that having a way around the Siegfried Line would help avoid the French fear of a manpower draining trench war. Tensions between Mussolini and Hitler would already be high as a socialist Italy could end up sending substantial aid to Republican Spain and give them equipment that was very much current and capable by inter-war standards. (I don't know enough about the civil war to weigh up how much of a difference it would make, but they would enjoy some great biplanes and would enjoy more frequent deliveries than the Soviets provided.)    In the case of war, Germany would not last long, they hadn't made any claims on Czechoslovakia at this stage so they lacked access to their high quality armaments industry that provided them with the reliable LT-38 (Panzer 38t) whilst the rest of their own Panzers were very early types that would be in big trouble against French armour.   Support for the Nazi party crashes as the Allies make inroads into the Ruhr whilst the Italian mountain troops creep into Austria. The Heer would soon remove Hitler in a coup so they can negotiate whilst Germany is intact to try and avoid another Treaty of Versailles and block any socialists or communists from gathering strength for their own revolution. Peace terms are not as harsh this time around since it has been a short war though the Allies maintain a long-term military presence to ensure the German army is scaled back and that the Nazi leadership is arrested and brought to justice.   With Nazi Germany dismantled and restored back into the Weimar Republic, a major war is a lot more likely to be against the Soviet Union over its ambitions in Europe or eventually Japan if America still embargoes them in response to their continuing war with China."

The extent of their territory is the modern states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo, and Campeche.   In the 1830s they fall into a small simmering guerrilla civil war over the conflict between the Christians and Traditionalist religion. By the 1840s they legalize both and an eclectic faith emerges. Their location in the world gives their ports some value and they charge basing fees to the French, British, and the Americans and that is their primary source of income.   in the 1880s and 1890s they develop minor industry based around local resources and in the 1950s develop a tourist industry. They side with the West in the Cold War and several anti communist operations were waged from their territory.   Their system of government has always been a nepotistic oligarchy, however it was never so corrupt as to be inefficient. A series of good leaders and a lack of a string of bad leaders allowed for slow and steady infrastructure development and a few kickbacks to British industrialists allowed a rail road to be constructed in the 1880s.   They have token elections but it is understood that the voters (male elites until the 1890s when it became males in general and the 1920s for all adults) were voting for the best among the oligarchy elites for the various posts.   The land owners, large and small, held their power through network ties and the local industrialists had to engage in the same behavior. By the 1930s a corporatist political structure emerged where interest groups were just amalgamated into the oligarchy structure. There were few strikes because the industrial executives, government officials, and union bosses would hash out details in the social clubs.    Early on there were many scandals about how european some of the elites where, but by the 1860s those genealogies had been rewritten that everyone was Mayan. The local Mayan language became standard with many Spanish loan words.   They used the Pound as their currency unit as the Spanish dolor was way too Spanish for them and adopted Metric to get rid of Spanish units, however, they gave the units Mayan names.   Proximity to several spanish speaking countries caused spanish langauge and latin american culture to seep in by osmosis over the decades, and by the 1890s the anti spanish move was long dead and Spanish language began to re-emerge."

I don't think they would have been able to do it otherwise, with what was going on in Europe and America at the time.   Korea becomes a massive operation for the British and allows them to flex their strength more effectively in Asia, from Korea they can lever power against the Chinese mainland nations (or be pushed out completely, but I'm more inclined to believe an Anglo-Korean alliance would fare pretty well against the Chinese) forcing one-sided trade deals upon them and making an absolute killing in exotic trade.  Why stop there though? Britain claims more territory along the Chinese coast, select ports that may prove beneficial and maybe even get a grasp on Indo-China if things turn out right.   In regards to Japan, this would greatly affect their foreign policy. The British may try to subjugate them once their foothold in Korea has been solidified. More likely though, they would try to open them up to trade much earlier than the Americans did and would not feed them militarily as they did in real life. The Russo-Japanese war, for example, wouldn't happen as the U.K would keep Japanese expansionist aims under check.  WW1 rolls around. Depending on the state of Japan, Korean troops:   a) play a similar roll to that of ANZAC forces and help fight on the Middle Eastern Front, after taking any German colonies that may have sprung up in the East.    b) Become Britain's first line of defence, and ward, against an opportunistic fledgling Japanese Empire.

HistoryWhatIf,3dkk8u,goblingoodies,8,Fri Jul 17 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"There's an idea that Neanderthal populations might have inspired accounts of mythological creatures like trolls. After all, imagine sharing the landscape with not-quite-people for thousands of years as they disappear. If Neanderthals lived in small family groups and were reasonably shy when would humans be totally satisfied that the weird ugly people who live in caves were truly all gone? But that's too speculative even for this reddit.  I'm not sure how history would play out differently. ""Recorded History"" starts about 5,000 years ago with Mesopotamian scripts so we're talking a minimum of 35,000 years or so tacked on to Neanderthal survival.   More time means more remains, which would definitely add to our knowledge of these close relatives. That might affect history in interesting ways. Certainly a written record left by not-people would be fascinating. Maybe in this world the uniqueness and superiority of humans would seem ridiculous in the light of this Neanderthal culture. Then again, maybe those ideas arise well before archaeology unearths and deciphers the Neanderthal script. Still, it would be quite a blow to the establishment, particularly if they invent writing before humans do. They do have a few 100,000 years head start.  I'd be really interested to see how their anatomy changes over time.  There are lots of differences between modern humans and neanderthals like the occipital bun, pronounced brow ridges, reduced chin, sockier limbs, barrel chests, broader hips, and big noses which humans lack. But back then the early european humans we used to call Cro-Magnons are a lot rougher and tougher looking anatomically than modern humans. They too possess more pronounced brows, and are generally taller than their agrarian descendants. Many of them also had occipital buns! Maybe some of these traits can be attributed to the interbreeding we know occurred 60,000 years ago between humans and neanderthals but I'm inclined to accept that lots of these traits are basal to humans and neanderthals. What would more modern Neanderthals look like? Would they display ""classic"" Neanderthal good looks? Would their features soften and ""humanize""? Or would they become even more pronounced over time? It's hard to predict without knowing all the selective pressures. Maybe Neanderthals found brow ridges sexy.   Since we know next to nothing about Neanderthal culture (although to be really fair it's not like the information available on prehistoric human culture is that much greater) the culture would be the most fascinating aspect. Anything about social structure (is it hierarchical?) or ritual (do they have religion?) would be invaluable to science.   What we do know is Neanderthals lived in groups, used their teeth to hold things a lot, hunted big game and gathered, traveled long distances or traded to find the right stones for their tools, probably maybe wore make-up and jewelry, probably maybe buried their dead, probably maybe sorta had music. They had fire, spears, cutting tools, scraping tools, and wore clothes though whether they make leather or could sew is up in the air, though they did dry meat. Also, they maybe sorta probably had speech.   If a group of them survived long enough to properly interact with modern humans maybe they are like small children to us, or maybe they are so different from us that we have trouble understanding each other. Otherwise, if they are just like us, like people, then since they can interbreed with us I don't see why history should play out significantly differently. They would be just another tribal population for the empires to deal with. It's not like people haven't found each other funny-looking, funny-sounding, and funny-smelling forever, Neanderthals aren't so different physically that it'd be bizarre, especially not in the context of the odd things people came up with like goblins, giants, trolls, elves, gnomes, centaurs, satyrs, cyclopes, fairies, demons, angels, oni, mermaids, and whatever the Krampus is supposed to be.

By 2000 the party has a sizeable representation in the Senate and House, and have had sizeable Presidential support. In the 2004 election the first New Communist Party President is elected and America enters the Communist era.  In Europe things are somewhat easier. Socialist Parties pop up and gain traction, supported by the Warsaw pact. A couple coups here and there and most of Europe is under the control of the Warsaw pact, with more Socialist governments in Africa. China becomes a proxy of the USSR. Mao is killed in the civil war, China gains more power and slowly becomes it's own cooperative faction with the Koreas and Southeast Asia. the world is pretty peaceful and human rights and HDI around the Communist/Socialist world are high. Science is in a computer renaissance."

HistoryWhatIf,3di098,Maqre,8,Fri Jul 17 03:23:04 2015 UTC,"I'll start with the late Brezhnev Era as our main point of divergence for this timeline.  1979: After the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza of Iran and the installation of a new theocratic oligarchy under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Soviet Government begins to worry about Khomeini's ideology gaining traction in Afghanistan and spreading into the constituent republics in Central Asia. Similarly, the Chinese Government begins to have worries about the ideology reaching the Uighurs in Xinjiang and causing widespread dissent against the government. During the UN General Assembly that year, Secretary General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev, Chinese President Deng Xiaoping, and US President Jimmy Carter meet in New York to develop a response to the Iranian crisis, with special focus on containing Khomeini's ideology and rescuing the American hostages. Yuri Andropov, head of the KGB, begins working with his American counterpart, CIA Director Stansfield M. Turner, to devise a plan to rescue the hostages from Tehran.   1980: After nearly a year in captivity, the hostages in Tehran are freed thanks to a daring rescue operation conducted by the KGB and CIA. The news that the KGB assisted in the operation gives Carter a boost in the polls due to optimism about the improving relations with the USSR and the release of the hostages. In Moscow, Carter and Brezhnev both appear together at the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics and later meet at the Kremlin with other members of the P5 to discuss the state of affairs in Central Asia. As the pro-Soviet government falters in its fight against Islamic fundamentalists, Brezhnev informs his counterparts that he is under pressure from other members of the Central Committee to intervene in the country as he did previously in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Brezhnev additionally offers Carter assistance in removing the Ayatollah from power in order to have the Shah return once more, albeit as a constitutional monarch with a role like that of Queen Elizabeth II. Carter defeats his opponent, Ronald Reagan, by a sound majority in November of that year.  1981: Massive protests unfold in the streets of Tehran as people speak out against the increasing restrictions on personal freedoms put in place by the Ayatollahs. An ailing Shah Mohammed Reza returns with his family to Tehran and are met with cheers and celebration. Members of the military sympathetic to the shah unite to oust the Ayatollahs from power. The Shah announces a return to peace and stability for the country. Three weeks after returning to the country, the Shah passes away and is secceeded by his twenty-one-year-old son, Shah Reza II. Shah Reza II announces a constitutional referendum which will deliver greater parliamentary democracy, a limited political role for the Monarchy, and a specific ban against parties which seek to undermine or destroy democratic and secular institutions. The new Constitution is adopted as Iran returns to being a peaceful and stable country.  1981: The Soviets begin their intervention in Afghanistan to help the country eliminate the Islamist threat. The PRC joins the Soviets in a cooperative effort to contain Islamic fundamentalism. With the eradication of the Afghan government's opponents, the USSR and PRC begin to have closer relations, with the PRC joining COMECON in 1982.  1982: President Carter passes what he calls a Second Great Society as he announces plans to provide every citizen with comprehensive social welfare programmes from the cradle to the grave with the intention of reducing poverty. In Moscow, the deceased Leonid Brezhnev is succeeded by the former Head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov as head of the Communist Party. Support for socialism increases in America as the two superpowers plan a joint-lunar mission.  1983: Friendship 1 lands on the surface of the moon as Soviet and American cosmonauts walk on the lunar surface together. The mission is hailed as an important hallmark of improving relations between East and West. In the same year, COMECON's influence grows internationally as Yugoslavia, Finland, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Laos, and Kampuchea all become full members. The EEC faces competition for economic supremacy in Europe.  1984: Secretary General Andropov attends the Opening Ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles with his counterpart, the soon-to-be-replaced President Carter. In Western Europe, support for left-wing parties increases, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal all electing socialist governments that year. In the UK, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faces strong leadership challenges in spite of the sucessful mission to retain British control over the Falkland Islands.   1985: President Carter leaves office as Walter Mondale is inaugurated. Mondale's inauguration is hailed as the first truly international inauguration as delegates from around the world, representing both socialist and non-socialist governments, attend the ceremony. Mondale further makes waves by declaring in his inaugural address his fundamental support for the principles of socialism as a system which can strengthen democratic institutions. Republicans foam at the mouth against him and pledge to make him a one-term president. In the UK, Thatcher loses a General Election as Labour come into power and announce a reversal of her policies as well as a plan for reunification with Ireland and the federalisation of the UK.  1986: Mondale's newly renamed Socialist People's Party gains an absolute majority in Congress. The majority of Mondale's opposition comes from the southern states, where many governors and other state officials make serious demands for succession.  1987: Mondale is narrowly re-elected to the presidency after an election which his opponents called ""rigged"". In the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, the people vote in favour of the reunification and federalisation plan.  1988: Mondale begins his second term marred by violence and instability. In the south, riots break out between workers in support of the Party and republicans against Mondale. Additionally, race riots break out once more in several southern cities. The President declares a State of Emergency and orders the National Guard to restore stability to the region. In the UK, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II attends a national celebration of unity as the UK officially becomes a federalised entity consisting of England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands. While the UK grows more united, the US grows more divided.  1989: The government of the FRG announce plans to unify with the GDR to form the United Republic of Germany. The URG, which comes into existence at midnight on 1 January 1990 will be the only country to be a member of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact as well as both COMECON and the EEC. World leaders hail the URG as a shining example of the growing detente throughout the world. In the USA, Mondale is able to defeat the growing nationalist sentiment in the south as many of his opponents go to prison or are assassinated.  1990: The URG comes into existence as people around the world celebrate the advent of what will be a decade of peace and reconciliation. In that same year, North Yemen and South Yemen begin reunification talks, as do North and South Korea. In Moscow, delegates from the Arab League States, Israel, the P5, the PLA, and the URG convene for Peace Talks concerning the Palestinian conflict. The Moscow Accords adopted that year result in the creation of a fully contiguous Palestine existing as a sovereign entity alongside a fully contiguous Israel. Jerusalem is divided between the two, with Palestine claiming East Jerusalem as its capital and Israel claiming the Western half of the city as its capital.   1992: In what becomes known around the world as the year of unity, The Korean peninsula comes under the banner of the United Democratic Republic of Korea (UDRK). The UDRK exists as a single-party state under the authority of the Korean People's Party and an ecomic boom takes place on the peninsula. North Yemen ceases to exist and is absorbed by South Yemen. The ROC dissolves and Taiwan reunifies once more with Mainland China. Mondale leaves office in January as his successor and former Vice President, Ted Kennedy is inaugurated in Washington. That year, NATO and the Warsaw Pact both vote to dissolve themselves as the P5 begin nuclear disarmament.  1993: South Africa, after years of existing as a pariah state splits between the various ethnic groups. The White South Africans carve out their own state made up of territory from South-West Africa, Cape Province, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State in order to create the new Republic of Boereland. The Zulu, Xhosa, and other ethnic groups form their own nation states in the rest of the country. The International Community welcomes the development as Apartheid ends relatively peacefully and socialism spreads in Africa.   1995: The EEC and COMECON merge as COMECON becomes the official economic organ of the UN as socialism becomes the dominant force of the world. Scientific developmens flourish due to the advents of computers and the planned Lunar Colony which becomes operational in 2000. Carter and Brezhnev are remembered as heroes for helping the world achieve peace and prosperity through socialism as people find themselves in a post-scarcity era of equally distributed resources."

Your timeline generally sounds too much like make-believe as well, Carter suddenly starting full-on socialist programmes which somehow get passed through both houses in the early 80s? Then a socialist president a few years later? Where did the popular support and the financial backing come from in the US of the 1980s? Common. The UK suddenly ""growing more united"" as a ""federalized entity"" soon after a devastating financial crisis which was still ongoing during your point of divergence and is likely to remain going during the 1980s without the necessary structural changes? Ireland, of all nations, deciding to rejoin the United Kingdom 40 years after fighting for independence and rejecting being a mere subject of the crown, while the IRA campaigns in Northern Ireland reach their infamous peak? Wuut?  Afterwards it becomes really weird, as the entire world apaprently suddenly decides to turn socialist. Especially the Korea part was funny, I hope that the ""Korean People's Party"" isn't supposed to be a ""united"" version of the Korean Worker's Party.

Or is there some covert social engineering going on in the background too?"
HistoryWhatIf,3di098,kfdirector,2,Thu Jul 16 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"1968: Suspected CIA agents detonate a suitcase bomb at a pro-North Vietnam demonstration in Stockholm, killing the Prime Minister and the North Vietnamese ambassador and leveling two blocks of Stockholm's historic core. The assassination is roundly condemned throughout the free democracies in Europe. Sweden appoints a hard-left PM who vows to seek Soviet protection in exchange for internal non-intervention (i.e. Finlandization). New Zealand and Australia both break off the alliance to support South Vietnam. The resulting scandal weakens both Johnson (who is personally implicated in the attack) and Nixon (who is viewed as untrustworthy as the Vietnam War is now unwinnable). George Wallace, who was segregationist but also who pledged to end the war in 90 days, wins enough electoral votes to throw the race to Congress. The resulting deadlock yields a Wallace-Humphrey grand coalition that representatives agree is a caretaker but that is intended to end the war (Wallace) while not backsliding into Jim Crow (Humphrey). The result is seen as profoundly undemocratic and riots erupt in the US, with calls for a new election to be held in light of the ""Stockholm incident"" and widespread disenchantment with the Washington establishment.  1969: The new caretaker government is inaugurated, with both Wallace and Humphrey signing binding pledges not to do anything ""too crazy."" Meanwhile, a tide of anti-Americanism in Europe continues as the newly emboldened Prime Minister of Italy releases a dossier on clandestine American activities in Italy and Western Europe. Like dominoes, most of the Continent Finlandizes, with even Great Britain becoming non-aligned. Mistakenly believing the segregationist Wallace to be the cause of the US' decline, two US Army generals have him shot and critically wounded. As he is paralyzed from the neck down, he resigns and leaves the presidency to Humphrey, who already is extremely unpopular and tarnished by his involvement in the (now ended) Vietnam War.  1970, round 1: Hubert Humphrey is impeached for his involvement in the Stockholm incident in spite of his nominating a pacifist Vice President. The UN Security Council votes 14-1 to establish an International Criminal Tribunal for Stockholm; gasps can be heard, including from the US' closest allies, when the US ambassador to the UN vetoes the bill. In an even more shocking move, said ambassador arrives at the Canadian embassy 10 hours later, saying that he faced death threats from the President and the head of the CIA if he did not veto the plan. At the same time, the USSR begins liberalizing not because of US pressure but because of mass migration into capitalist Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and West Germany, which are all Warsaw Pact members. In a closed-door Politburo meeting, USSR officials present a schedule of defections that shows that almost 60% of Soviet citizens deployed to Warsaw Pact Northern Europe attempt to leave, as do about 40% of those deployed to Warsaw Pact Greece and Cyprus.  1970, round 2: After a six-month delay, Humphrey's impeachment trial begins led by Republicans and segregationists. Humphrey's vice president, an antiwar Catholic priest named Philip Berrigan who was chosen in a vain attempt to allow Humphrey to remain in power, testifies against him using documents that he ""spirited away"" from the White House. The House is astonished that the Vice President committed burglary while in office and impeaches him as well. As the Senate has never tried a simultaneous impeachment of the President and Vice President, and knowing that Berrigan would be able to appoint anyone he wished if he became president because he was facing impeachment anyways, his impeachment moves to the front of the line. Humphrey however resigns...and Berrigan still ends up as president with a signed contract to re-appoint Humphrey as VP. The chaos in Washington begins spreading to the broader economy as must-pass bills get tied up in the political sideshow, resulting in a string of accidental government shutdowns.  1971: Berrigan is removed for burglary, with Humphrey returning to the presidency while still facing impeachment charges. In a desperate attempt to stop the trial, Humphrey appoints Elijah Muhammad of the Nation of Islam as his VP, knowing that Muhammad will never be confirmed by Congress and attempting to set up a Supreme Court showdown as both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency will be vacant. The bid fails, and President Pro Tempore Allen Ellender, a dovish conservative, becomes President.  1972: President Allen Ellender dies. Realizing the dangers of holding up matters further, he had appointed Spiro Agnew (Nixon's running mate) as his own VP. After several more caretakers, the US staggers to a new presidential election. A term that was supposed to be served by one president has been filled by six: Wallace, Humphrey, Berrigan, Humphrey again, Ellender, and Agnew. The resulting instability leads to the US being called ""Argentina North"", with capital flowing to Western Europe and the liberalizing USSR.  1974: Although Congress deliberately delays impeaching President Agnew over his looming criminal charges in a bid to boost stability, an economic downturn as well as outrage that a criminal defendant is occupying the White House results in a ""change"" election that sees a record % of Representatives and senators ousted. As Congress reluctantly begins yet another impeachment trial, it learns -- too late -- that it is no longer the world's #1 power and no longer is even the #1 capitalist power, as gradual Soviet-European integration has resulted in a bloc of mixed economies stretching from Lisbon to Chukotka."

Popular music would mourn - a group with tremendous crowd-drawing and chart-topping potential like the Beatles wiped out in what was essentially only the first chapter of their saga. However, not knowing the full extent of their would-be musical influence would lessen the blow overtime, and slowly the Beatles would fade as a ""potential legend before its time.""  The Rolling Stones would take up the mantle of leaders of the British Invasion, competing intensely with other British exports such as the Animals and the Who. The Stones would also lead the popular-psychadelic revolution in 1966, becoming the main influence in popular rock music in that age and others forward.  The introduction of Creedence Clearwater Revival to American charts in 1968 begins a deviation in popular interest from British export rock to home-grown, grassroots protest music. Especially so with the Vietnam draft, the Stones decide not to interfere in public opinion and refrain from any partisan songwriting in the period. Country Joe & the Fish and CCR are amongst the chart-toppers in the late 60s before falling like dominoes to the visceral export Led Zeppelin, topping charts (but receiving tons of critic hate) with their second album, Led Zeppelin II. The Rolling Stones jump back in the fray with a slew of progressive-inspired rock as well, beginning a studio/experimental arms race for the charts.  Spiritual music on the level of George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord"" or his earlier raja-rock fails to break into the mainstream.   70s rock is changed without Paul McCartney's guidance as lead songwriter of the day with Wings and his own solo projects. There's much less formula in popular 70s rock - think less ""Hotel California"", and more Led Zeppelin-inspired epochal rock operas.  McCartney was an excellent songwriter, but was known for having a very rigid, almost formulaic approach to songwriting. Compared to his songwriting partner John Lennon, McCartney was classically musically trained and had a more school-book approach to music theory, whereas the self-taught John Lennon was more free-form, emotional and raw.  With the guidance of the innovative Stones, Led Zeppelin and a quickly-transforming Eric Burdon & the Animals, 70s rock becomes an era of strange, mysterious rock experimentation rather than the packaged amplified-acoustic 3-chord singer-songwriter hits we associate the 70s with today. There's much more R&B, psychadelia and traditional heavy metal influence in rock as a result.  John Lennon's face doesn't end up printed en masse on $15 t-shirts. He's remembered more fondly in his native England as a poor soldier's boy who broke out of his neighborhood through hard work and raw ambition, only to be lost just before the limelight."

The loss of so many pilots and aircraft might have been felt sooner in the war, since the Japanese would have run out of trained pilots a lot sooner without the forces from Pearl Harbor, but they would have fought on regardless.

Prior to the launch of warplanes from Japanese warplanes from their aircraft carriers, they had several units doing recon in the area.  They had a sea plane, an a submarine in the area.  Had the US forces been alerted to a massive convoy of Japanese carriers bearing down on Pearl Harbor, the US Navy would have sortied all their warships out of Pearl Harbor, the US Army and Army Air Corps forces would have been on full alert and combat air patrols would have put to the skies.  All this activity would have been certainly noticed by the Japanese recon of the area.  If you read Gordon Prange's At Dawn We Slept, there were contingency plans built in to the Japanese Navy's Pearl Harbor attack in the event that the attack were no longer a surprise.  Nagumo, the commander of the battle fleet charged with the Pearl Harbor attack would have turned his forces around and not attacked.  That was the order per the op plans - that if full surprise could not be achieved, the attack would not be launched.  So in the case, the US is alerted, Japan sees the overwhelming US activity signaling that surprise cannot be achieved and Nagumo turns his carrier battle group around and sails back to Japan.  Then Japan works towards a diplomatic solution to smooth things over with the US saying that the battle group was simply a naval exercise in international waters."

For one thing, the timing of when Turkey joins the axis is imperative. If Turkey openly joins the Axis (say 1937) then you risk the British and French in the Middle East turning their eye onto Turkey. Now what I most likely imagine would happen in this situation is that Turkey covertly receives help from Germany, they have a large military but are way behind Britain and France in terms of capability. A few years of German training and arming (1935-1941) turns Turkey from a non-factor to a contender in the region. Now here is the predicament for Germany, despite population transfers after WWI. There are still a lot of Turks in the former Rumelia region which is not split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Macedonia. Germany is aligned with Bulgaria and Italy. What I think happens in this case is Germany realizes the allies with more potential are Turkey and Italy, the can easily bully Bulgaria into agreeing to whatever terms they set. After the invasion of the Balkans, I think Turkey gets parts of Northern Greece and into Albania and Italy takes the southern part as well as Croatia and Slovenia. Bosnia and Serbia become autonomous regions until something more concrete can be settled after the war. Turkey is satisfied regaining some of its Muslim lands in Europe, Italy controls the Adriatic and Athens.   In the east, I think Turkey does 3 things. First they sweep up the Black Sea coast and capture the port of Batumi. With the German invasion of Russia, the only other ports of Odessa and Sevastopol are now obsolete and the Russians lose the Black Sea. Then the Turks sweep across the Caucus Mountains with little Russian resistance and take over Armenia (lots of resistance) and Azerbaijan (little to no resistance). Azerbaijan is key to the German war effort because it has large and relatively developed oil reserves, with Russian forces being limited due to the German invasion the oil fields should relatively easy to take. Another thing is that Azeris see Turks as their kin, it would not be difficult at all for Turkey to rile support for their effort. From Azerbaijan, the Turks can begin moving into Muslim regions of Russia and working to close off the Russian oil supply as well as inciting Azeris in Iran (a lot of Azeris live in Iran). Inciting unrest in Iran will slow down the power of the Allied lend-lease that was flowing through Iran and cutting the Russian oil supply effectively leaves them dead in the water. Last thing they do is the engage the Allies in Syria/Iraq. Its unlikely the Turks would incite any local support but if they can reach the Suez they effectively seal off the Mediterranean. I don't think it would be wise for Turkey to move against the British and French but if there is an opportunity to take the Suez then it should be done.   Results: Assuming everything goes to plan and the Turks are able to help in Europe and sweep across the Caucuses the Germans gain a lot. If oil from Azerbaijan can be transported to Batumi then it can be shipped to Romania where it can be directly supplied to the Germans, which is a HUGE advantage compared to the OTL. Another thing is the Russian oil supply is cut significantly and lend-lease is hurt if Azeris in Iran become restless. The biggest motive for recruiting Turkey in my opinion is to weaken Russia into submission quickly so that troops can be moved back west to defend against a possible invasion. Turkey plays a strategic role because they can effectively cut the Russians off at the knees and let the Germans finish them off quickly. The Turks regain strength in their military as well as returned influence and presence in the Balkans. They also gain access to a developed port in Batumi and the Middle East oil which can be used to power an industrial revolution in Turkey."

If Turkey joined the WW2, I think they would expand through east without even having to fight anyone, until they come across to Japs and give soviets very hard time.

My guess (and it's no more than that) is that Japan would continue with the invasion of SE Asia as in our timeline. India pushing for independence would hinder the British war effort (and more than any benefit from transferring troops from Europe would counteract), India would be more threatened by the Japanese than in our timeline, and probably you'd get a pull-back on calls for independence until the war was won. Overall not much change, but probably the British might pull out a little faster, and relationships between all sides involved would be a bit worse, so Partition (and subsequent India/Pakistan relations) would be in turn worse than in OTL."

Japan allies with Germany and Italy in the Axis Pact and Britain stays out of the war in 1941 when Barbarossa happens.  Japan then doesn't have as much resource crunch because Britain and Europe aren't roped into the US embargo and has less motivation to attack in 1942.

We still have almost six hundred years of history before the eventual collapse of the Western empire in 476 A.D. I mean the historic implications of no Roman empire are so massive and purely speculative because they shaped so much of western history.   their would be no evolution of romance languages romanisation would not occur greco-roman culture might not be seen as important, nor would they be so closely fused. the Byzantine empire does not exist (that's a fairly obvious one) Roman style city planning is confined to the Italian Peninsula Warfare between the Romans and the Gauls would be common as the Gauls would still continue to migrate - whether a smaller republic would be capable of dealing with this threat in the long term is interesting. Carthage is never destroyed - Punic culture is better understood in the modern world, they are considered the preeminent Mediterranean power of Antiquity.  Parthia could come to dominate the Hellenized kingdoms of the east, thus potentially retarding Christianity (or stopping it all together). This has it's own profound influence over western Europe which is worthy of it's own speculative piece of alternate history.  Paganism would exist in Western Europe longer the Roman Republic might not collapse like its imperial counterpart but it is impossible if and when it would. The Republic certainly had internal strife that was never addressed adequately and it's fair to say that this weakness could lead to the downfall of the republic."

The post-Alexandrian middle east would dominate the world, expanding into Europe, but a definite border would emerge between the civilized world (Rome, Egypt, Greece etc) and the uncivilized world (barbarians), although Carthage would probably conquer Iberia and expand into Europe, coming into conflict with the Greek world for European dominance"
HistoryWhatIf,3dgbs1,grapp,14,Thu Jul 16 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"(I'll interpret this to refer to peoples born south of the Sahara.)  I think the House of Solomon in the Ethiopian Empire takes the lead. It was a new dynasty and quite ambitious. They're perfectly situated to explore what's left of the world and they have the knowledge to do so effectively.  With the fall of Rome and Jerusalem, the Ethiopian Church makes it its mission to preserve holy artifacts, writings, and sites. Its priests and monks travel throughout Holy Land and to Rome to preserve relics of the faith. The preservation effort is such a massive task that permanent missions are established to watch over the most important sites, and these become future centers of new settlements.  There is an initial wave of ""accidental"" colonization. It happens when entrepeneurs decide to raid the necropolises of the rest of the world. But demand for looted goods in Africa swiftly subsides, leading small bands of scavengers and merchants flung about Eurasia.  Islam initially has surviving regions in Africa, but this plague predates most of the sub-Saharan conversions. The devastation of the religion's heart in Arabia weakens the faith everywhere. The Warsangali Sultunate, barely founded at the time of the plague, topples after several years.  By 1400, the Ethiopian Church has dozens of large missions across Europe and hundreds of small ones across Eurasia. The missions are the hearts of rapidly enlarging towns, which have grown to supply priests with food and clothing.  In Africa, the Empire has taken to crusades to exterminate Islam, and it's succeeding. There are pockets of survivors but the House of Solomon is eliminating them.  By 1500 the Empire has eliminated most traces of Islam and has turned to establishing hegemony over all of Africa. It is involved in major wars with Kongo and the Mali Empire.   The Church is flourishing elsewhere. While the heart of the Empire is secular and military in practice, the Church is faithful and intellectual. The mission culture is dynamic and continually evolving; it's just too easy to pick and restart a ruined farm somewhere a few miles away whenever the authorities get too controlling. As a result, the mission world is largely governed by consensus communities. Priests are respected informal leaders who advise their towns.  The Church and Empire are increasingly different in character but still on excellent terms; the people don't think of themselves as distinct, especially as they regularly cross-pollinate. Intellectuals and spiritually-minded people leave the Empire to join or found missions, while secular, adventurous types often the Mission towns to join the armies.  By 1600, the Empire has conquered all of Africa - or at least can claim the perimeter. It is now focused on the complex task of ""civilizing"" the deep interior.  And now, in a remote mission of the Church, in far off and inhospitable Iceland, a young priest discovers ancient documents referring to ""Alfheim"", some remote land to the far west across the sea."

When Germany eventually goes to war with the Soviet Union, a Sino-Japanese coalition attacks Siberia to reclaim land taken by Russia. Should the British and French still go to war with Germany, the Sino-Japanese alliance takes this opportunity to take Indochina, Burma, and eventually India with the stated reason being to end colonialism.

For now I'll go with the OTL on this one.   In this timeline, the Allies are still victorious but the war is much longer in the Pacific (meaning more nuclear weapons). Japanese technology and industry combined with Chinese raw materials and manpower would be a formidable foe.

Up in Berlin, last week, a couple of guys on both sides actually got killed.  So much for 'solidarity with the masses', huh?

It's 1913 all over again for them! Pathetic...           That Hister guy got locked away for a couple of years; that's when he wrote that book: ""My Struggle"", I've read it.

Put people back to work building weapons, not consumer goods. Great way to get re-invaded, if you ask me: those guys won't stand idly by and let these ""Nazis"" -- that's what they call themselves -- build up another war machine.  At least Germany doesn't have a Kaiser anymore: now it's a modern state with a reasonable democratic government.          And even if they did win -- they'd have to govern. These guys couldn't govern their way out of a paper bag.  You know, ten years ago, they tried to take over the government with some kind of insurrection -- a putsch, I think they called it.  #FAIL.  About the only way they could govern is to clamp down, and establish some sort of centralized authority, like the Supreme Soviet is doing under Stalin -- that's not working out too well for them.

Maybe if they got rid of that Hilter guy, and his racist ideas, put that old war hero Goering in charge of the party, and figure out a sane economic policy, they might have a chance in '36.          Oh, and while they're at it, they should dump their name: it's unwieldy, and kind of puzzling.  Why not go back with the old ""German Worker's Party"" name that they had just after the war: it's short, sweet and to the point.

HistoryWhatIf,3d9tqq,dudewiththebling,7,Tue Jul 14 16:55:34 2015 UTC,"Now, it is the question of why Israel is never created.  The very idea of the Jewish state exists since the Romans disbanded their client state of Judea and integrated the region directly, but it was really getting started by three things:  1) The writings of Theodor Herzl (""Der Judenstaat"")  2) The persecution of Jews in tsarist Russia before WW1  3) The Holocaust    Now, the rules of HWI would of course allow me to make one of those things disappear, but let's focus on the formation of Israel itself, which came about by  A) Mass emigration of Jews to Palestine because of the reasons 2 and 3 stated above  B) British (double crossing) promises to Palestinian Muslims and to Jews that they would gain their own independent states after the Ottoman collapse after WW1.  C) Pro-Jewish sentiment after WW2, with the Holocaust and all.    Now, both reasons A and C are pretty much human nature. If someone tries to horribly murder you, leaving the country sounds like a good idea. And if you just saved someones life from horribly being murdered, helping them is natural. But the reason B could serve as our point of divergence.  Now, let's assume the Brits only promise Palestine to the Muslims.   Shortly after WW1, the area of Palestine (also including today's Jordan) was put under British mandate status, which the British liked, as they had also promised the area TO THEMSELVES in former negotiations with the French over the destiny of the Ottoman belongings in the middle east.  Let's assume this went down differently. Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait still went to Britain; Lebanon and Syria still went to France; but Palestine (including today's Israel, Gaza Strip and West Bank) comes under the control of a British puppet state, much like the later Iraqi, Yemeni and Omani governments in our timeline.  Palestine, originally promised to Muslim leaders as a part of a unified Sunni Arabic state (in order to have them rebel against the Ottomans), stays independent because of the rise of the Saudis and their willingness to follow British guidance in regards to how the region should be run; in exchange for trade routes and support for their government. Britain is in favor of direct British control over the Ottoman middle East and also in favor of keeping a close grip on Palestine.  Palestine fights for the allies in World War 2, especially in North Africa.  Shortly after WW2, the mass exodus of Jews from Europe and the world really sets in. But, as statistics show, they still did not make a majority, but maybe a third of the country's population. I would imagine that the natural tensions between muslims and jews, both feeling in their rightful holy land, would lead to an apartheid-like system, with jews being treated as second-class citizens. Jews are denied the right to serve in the army or police force and may not bear arms, therefore being inherently inferior to the muslims who have all these freedoms.    Palestine becomes fully independent in the wave of independence sweeping the world in the late 50s and early 60s. The world soon looks down upon their discrimination like they did with South Africa OTL. Unlike SA, which had only a few friends, Palestine still has allies in the autocratic regimes and dictatorships of Muslim states nearby, like Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Palestine would be a part of the Arab League and therefore anti-Iran. In the cold war side of things, I would imagine the autocrats of the Middle East would still, like in OTL, feel inclined to join the Soviet side even without the US backing Israel; as the Soviets are understandably less interested in puny democracy.  (By the way: That would mean that the US would be a natural ally of Iran. Yes, think about that. Anyway, moving on.)  Around the time the Soviet bloc falls, along with the apartheid system in South Africa, the apartheid in Palestine would also fall. Jews would be admitted into politics (if Palestine were a democracy, which I did not cover), the armed forces and generally into society, but there would still be a notable split in society, for example in average wage and distribution among suburbs (look at the USA with the black-white split as an example). Tensions in the region remain high, but with no one arming them like in OTL, the jews are constrained to maybe a few insurgent groups instead of - you know, being at war with their neighbours all the time.    And there you have it. Israel is never created."

HistoryWhatIf,3dapor,anarchokawaii,2,Tue Jul 14 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"China did have a great age of exploration. Then the emperor was done with that and it stopped.   So, spittballing here with no information about Chinese politics or government of the era so this is a wild-ass-guess (grain of salt is here for you to take) the Emperor says to ditch the ship and other kingdoms or private traders buy them up because they were good ships. The Arabs and Indian port cities have a strong lock on trade on the west, and I think the Japanese were doing ok in the north east, so they go REALLY far north.   They follow the east coast up and around, following the Inuit peoples and trading along the coast of Siberia and Alaska. (I have no idea who these traders are, or which cultures they come from since my knowledge of east asia in this time is superficial and infected by playing Europa Universalis 4 a whole lot so take some more salt). They start trading with peoples up around British Columbia and find the furs, obsidian, and what not, and these Indians really like the metal work and pottery and spices, so a minor trade network builds up.  The metal work and pottery and contact with buddhism, islam, taoism, shintoism, and hindusim in the Pacific North West as well as Indian folk religions going east cause some cultural shifts.   A few buddhist and muslim missionaries land and start working with various pacific north west tribes (again, not a clue who lived there and how they existed, more salt) and along with them several plagues.   The plagues, trade, and religions cause paradigm shifts and we see some more complex social structures rising. We also see Islamic and Buddhist native Americans but the travel distance causes local flavors to become more pronounced and even filter back to asia.   All of this really happens in the 1300s and 1400s. The plagues spread through the whole continent by the mid 1400s and recovery is beginning. The native Americans develop immunity just by surviving. The trade in metal and pottery and the introduction of different crops, through trade, create several powerful trade cities along the west coast along natural harbors, such as Vancouver, San Diego, San Francisco, etc. They take on local cultural features along with cultural mixing.    Of course, this has little impact on Europe since news that travels gets distorted and these trade cities are assumed by many Europeans to be on islands, islands Columbus expects to find and convinces the King of Portugal to fund him. He goes west in the 1480s or so and finds the other side of these ""islands"" with people that look like they should.   America doesn't get it's name, Amerigo Vespuci does stuff, but different stuff, so the land mass gets a new name.  Portual claims some land on the islands and the Eastern Coast, but some of them are Islamic! This is not good.   Spain, or what would become Spain, is fighting Granada, but news of Muslims in the west causes an Islamic resurgence and a bunch of Muslim kings send forces to help Granada survive and even expand a bit, by 1500 they have signed an uneasy peace and Granada is an Islamic port going west.   Now we have a Christian/Muslim land scramble going west and the African Muslim kingdom of Mali secures coastal lands and their conquest of what would become Brazil is quite rapid.   While the Aztec, Maya, and Inca never convert, and are quite hostile to Muslims and Buddhists for their ways, other political units do rise up among the Native Americans and ally themselves with old world Islamic powers. by the 1500s the first Native American Haji are recognized, however, a few had actually made the journey in the 1400s but no one recognized them for what they were.  The Christian powers are set back by the Reformation but by the late 1500s northern Europeans are starting to claim posts in the Caribbean Islands and North Eastern North America where Islam and Buddhism were only thinly spread, their main points of power were West Coast port cities.   The Metal work trade networks, however, did supply east coast native Americans with swords, metal pots and utensils, and metal farm tools and their population was rapidly expanding in the wake of the disease and they were growing from horticulture level farming to heavy agriculture.  Their societies were also growing more complex in response to larger populations.   Contact with various Christian factions and European cultures came off much more equitably and the lack of plague die-off dramatically reduced European smugness since there were far fewer signs of God's favor and the Indians seemed much less savage since they were farming and using metal, backwards, but not savage.   European colonies that survived did so by being fair to the Indians, or armed camps. These would have dramatic impacts on the nature of European Colonization, that is to say, to limit it strictly.   Having more sources of trade goods, and their own home brewed things to trade back, Trade Empires thrived while colonies of farmers and religious outsiders struggled.   Cultures that were far more open to intermarriage created the norm while more xenophobic colonists were squeezed out. The Native American population was too large, their political units were too organized, and too well armed.   A number of European enclaves did survive, especially around what would be Quebec and New England and created unique European-American cultures, but far more Dutch and French than English. The English colonies all failed except around Virginia where tobacco did take off, but the Indians quickly grew it themselves. They also took to Cotton and were quite willing for low yields from hand seeding cotton until they developed their own cotton gin in the mid 1700s.   The economic impacts on south east asia made them stronger and so the French were unable to take them over, the dutch were able to weasel their way into part of Indonesia, but were thrown out in the 1790s.    the UK industrialized in the 1750s because they had steam engines and coal, but with far fewer resources to call upon. Because of that, the concepts spread far more widely through trade networks and the early 1800s Industrialization was far more dispersed around the world with centers rising up in San Francisco (what ever the name might be), Cairo, Hamburg, and Timbuktu where the trade networks brought in great amounts of raw materials.   The Atlantic Slave Trade never kicked off. The Muslim sugar growers knew how to be productive without slave labor and with out that general idea, the expansion of slavery was kept limited. Many African slaves did cross the sea, along with others, but race slavery never developed.   However, the New World was much more culturally diverse than it became in our time. This prevented large nations from forming and through the 18th and 19th centuries colonial independence movements  spread and by the 21st century there were dozens of countries many between the size of Texas and Panama."

This is a major thing to know about how Europeans of different kinds dealt with the Native Americans.   The English wanted land for farms, they had excess population to do things with. The Spanish couldn't get enough people to go, the French didn't allow many people to go, and the Dutch didn't really have the surplus population to go.   My scenario had south east asian groups trading with the Indians and religiously converting them. Not displacing them. You will get some Vietnamese guys moving into the Tacoma area and mixing with the locals, but they will be merchants or missionaries mostly.   After a while maybe farmers would move there, but most won't. Farmers are very conservative and farming in Vietnam is very different than in the Pacific North West. They might be involved in teaching the locals farming in support of growing merchant towns.  Those merchant towns will also be mostly native american with only a thin asian elite, think like European domination of India.

Maybe 100,000, not 3 million.  There was not a food base large enough to support 3 million people on those islands.  Also, while the Taino people were eventually wiped out, as a people, that was a result not of Genocide, but of conversion, intermixing, and being worked to death.   Many native american cultures were wiped out, adjusted, or mixed in with Spanish or other cultures. This is radically different than what the English did.    In fact they reduced the population from 11M to about 3M by the time smallpox got a foothold in the Antilles   You are claiming they killed 8 million people before the mid 1500s. They didn't have the man power or the time to physically kill that many people. 90% of the Indians that died did so because of disease.   Cortes returned to Tenochtitlan and found it devastated after the Aztecs kicked the crap out of him. The massive death of the Indians was caused by germs.    The Spanish abused the arawak and Carib and Taino because they wore gold and still had stone age weaponry. Men were put to the mines and women and children were killed. Saying that the Spanish did not commit genocide is as ignorant as saying ""getting them to work""   The Spanish used the indians for labor, as you pointed out. My argument was that the English ERADICATED THEM for the purposes of eradication, to clear the land for their own use. This is radically different from the Spanish who accidentally eradicated them by using them up as forced labor.   The Spanish weren't going around wiping out the Indians, they went there to exploit them as laborers and convert them to the faith. This is heavily contrasted with the English who did not care to convert them and just wanted their land, so they just went to war and killed off the Indians every chance they could."

However, with the South as an ally to the British, the British might help prop up the new country even farther to ensure the Americans aren't a threat to their cotton trade.   Slavery ends in 1833, around the same time as Britain as they inform the (lets call them) Confederacy that if they don't abolish the practice, they will sever ties with their ally. The CSA reluctantly agrees, but deals with the British as to send all the Slaves to the West African coast as the CS fears a slave revolt. In exchange for using their ships to send the slaves to Africa, the British get tons of Cotton and Tobacco from the CS.   Back to 1812, the British use their their new ally and their remaining possessions in Canada to take the Louisiana territory from the French. The Americans also are interested in Westward expansion and take some of the Northern Louisiana territory.  To make up for the slave labor being gone. Britain deals with the CS to send them prisoners in exchange for lower cotton rates. These indentured Servants make their way to the south to work on plantations. Australia is still founded. The British instead divert the Irish to Australia instead of letting them go to the US. Australia is more of a new Eire than a prison colony of the empire.

The first problem that would need to be fixed would be the economy. After the first economic crisis post world war one and then the stock market crash of 1929.   Perhaps we could get a political candidate pushing economic reform after 1929 similar to roosevelt's new deal. The economy slowly recovers in the 1930s. Germans become much more optimistic with unemployment going below 5% by 1935.  With a surviving weimar republic you see the new expansionist power in europe will be the soviet union. I believe most of europe and the league of nations would team up against communism and the soviets.  Most of the treaty of Versailles is slowly removed and fades away. Germany is able to re-occupy the Rhineland,regain the Saar and unify with Austria. Czechoslovakia guarantees rights of Germans inside the county.  The Soviets in the late 1930s and early 1940s annex the Baltic states and prepare for another war with Poland and Finland. This time the USSR is much stronger when it invades Finland and Poland. Germany,France and Great Britain declare war on the Soviet Union.   After a somewhat successful invasion of Poland and a bitter guerrilla campaign in Finland, the forces of Europe turn the tide of the war against the soviets. The combined might of most Europe fight off the Soviets. Eventually the USSR surrenders. The USSR is dismantled. As a reward Germany receives the corridor and Dazing.

It may not have been as prestigious as the old Carthaginian city but it was still fairly vital for West-East trade within the empire and transporting the much needed grain supplies to Italy. Likewise, razing the capital would most likely displace former Roman citizens and result in a feeling of resentment at the arriving Roman forces. Keep in mind, the Vandals were very much alien to the people of North Africa. Really all the Romans needed to do was prosecute war against the Vandals and their 'moorish' allies.

First, Bush would not have bailed on Somalia after the ""Black Hawk Down"" situation. Instead of pulling out, he would have been sending tanks and humvees down the streets of mogadishu in an attempt to assert UN (realistically US) authority.   Osama Bin Laden believed that the Somalia campaign indicated that the U.S. did not have the stomach to fight a prolonged war anymore. This strongly influenced his tactics and strategy, and might have had far-reaching implications for the war on terror.  Next up, Bush would have exercised military force in Rwanda to stop the genocide there. A battalion of well-supplied U.S. soldiers, with the requisite support, would have crushed both the Hutu and Tutsi militias, and the Hutu radio station that was used to broadcast orders to the Hutu militias (usually where to go and who to kill when you got there) would have been scrambled by the CIA.  The August, 1998 bombings in Tazmania and Kenya would probably still occur, and Bush would have ordered the same retaliatory airstrikes that Clinton did, so no change there.  However, there are severe implications for domestic issues, particularly gay rights. Clinton passed DOMA and Dont Ask Don't Tell, but Bush would have been much more conservative, in an attempt to stay popular among his religious base. That might mean no gays in the military, period. It might even result in Bush campaigning for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as one man and one woman. If Newt Gringrich's tenure as Speaker of the House overlapped with Bush's presidency, he might have even got it.   So some good changes and some bad changes, depending on how you look at it.   John Kerry might have made a run at the presidency in 1996 or 2000. Hillary would probably still be beaten by Obama assuming Dubya still becomes president in 2000 or 2004.

We'd probably see the Nazis loot and pillage the rest of Europe to feed Germany, leading to more fighting, civilian casualties, and eventually more starving elsewhere on the continent. Germany would probably under complete military control and under martial law at this point, conscription would probably be extended to support their control/exploitation of the rest of Europe, and eventually the combined manpower of the USSR and industrial power of the United States would overcome the Nazi war machine, but only after tens of millions more dead.   And that's just assuming a limited usage of chemical weapons. If Hitler decides to go all out and use all of Germany's stockpiles during the Battle of Moscow to get a much needed edge, we could see the Soviet Union potentially being damaged enough to allow for some sort of treaty to prevent further carnage, or at least crippled enough to make Operation Barbarossa worthwhile.

It would have definitely had an effect towards the secret programs of their respective militaries and intelligence organizations. The most notable change in history would be in the Vietnam War. With the United States more reluctant on using chemical and biological weapons, then they would have had less of an incentive towards using these weapons in Vietnam - leading to less people being effected by deadly chemical and biological weapons like Agent Orange.

Italian equipment was far superior, but the troop morale was not so great as payment was relatively low and many soldiers didnt see the need for the war in Ethiopia. Keep in mind, regular Italian footmen were no blackshirts or SS men, so they were not really indoctrined with the strive for racial supremacy.  Italian prestige in the world is shattered. They lost to Ethiopia - again! Their former allies from WW1, whose relations to Italy were only really disturbed by the invasion of Ethiopia in the first place, now do not consider picking up the military alliance again; while the OTL allies in Germany and Japan are reminded to go a different path than allying Italy.  1938  The Anschluss happens. Italy feels as threatened by the removal of the Austrian buffer state than it was OTL, but in this timeline, Hitler doesn't give a shit. He has decided to focus more on the Balkan alliance.   He prefers Yugoslavia over Italy, as the two nations' conflicting territorial claims were what kept the Yugoslavs out of the axis and, next to a regime change, ultimately pushed them into the hands of the allies (and axis occupation) OTL.  The Pact of Steel is never signed. Italy stays out of the Anti-Comintern Pact, which would at its largest scale consist of Germany, Japan, the Japanese puppets, the German puppets, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and (instead of Croatia) the afromentioned Yugoslavia.  In general though, the fascists still stay relatively close to each other. Franco still wins the Spanish Civil War because both Italy and Germany supported him. The State of Spain becomes an ally of Italy, and they form their own pact, let's call it the Southern Axis, as they both view mutual defence superior to the expansion of the ""Northern Axis"".  The events of Czechoslovakia go down as in OTL, Italy however is not present at the signing of the Munich treaty.  1939  War in Europe! Germany and shortly after the USSR (Molotov-Ribbentrop is still signed) invade Poland.    And there you have it. The most extreme case as in what could have happened with Italy should they not conquer Ethiopia.  Italian Fascism would collapse shortly after Soviet victory of the nazis.

More resources are poured into the intelligence services of Germany, and they are forced into becoming a much more efficient and loyal servant of the Third Reich.   With the emphasis on ""removing"" intellectual and wealthy Jewish People I think we'd see an increase in assassination attempts in foreign countries by the Nazi Party. Nations that were viewed by Hitler as being ""controlled by Jews"" would face the brunt of these attacks (think the USSR). The Jews working in the financials and political fields would live in fear of never waking up every time they went to sleep. All those physicists who fled Germany for places that won't prosecute their religion? They aren't safe anymore.

Israel may no longer be formed, possibly leading to less violence in the area (not that I'd put much faith in that) and anti-semitism may have been more commonplace than it is today as well.   I personally can't think of any Jewish People of massive, history changing importance that would have assassinated through this method other than the ones involved with the Manhattan Project (I don't think this would have halted the project, maybe delayed it a little).

It's possible some Americans see Nazism in a more favorable light after criminals eliminated, especially considering the lack of disdain for antisemitism before the holocaust was revealed).

In response to the revolt the liberal President gave in to some of the conservative's demands and, after dissolving and reforming the Congress, resigned his office. Zuloaga was proclaimed President by his conservatives, however, according to the Mexican Constitution, the President of the Supreme Court was supposed to become President until new elections could be held when a President  resigned. Liberals supported  the President of the Supreme Court, Benito Juarez, as the real Mexican President. The Reform War of 1857–1861 started and eventually, after a lot of early defeats, the liberals were victorious. The war was costly and destroyed most of the Mexican Infrastructure, also conservative guerrilla's would be a thorn in the governments side for years to come.   After the war Juarez was elected President and took over a country devastated by war, the economic system was so crippled that Juarez was forced to tell foreign powers that Mexico owed money to that they would have to stop paying the interest on their loans for a few years. This angered France, Britain and, Spain who sent forces to capture Veracruz, Mexico's most valuable port. Though Spain and Britain soon pulled out, the French Emperor Napolean III decided that this was a perfect time to establish a French puppet state. A younger brother of the Emperor of Austria, was proclaimed Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico on April 20th 1864, and the liberal government under Juarez was forced to leave Mexico city and set up a government in exile in Chihuahua. The United States, embroiled in The Civil War, offered their sympathy to Juarez and sent a strongly worded letter to France but were unable to help. War raged throughout Mexico as the liberal government in exile fought against Maximilian and his conservative allies, remember those conservative guerrillas?  When the American Civil War finally wrapped up, Maximilian was still in power in Mexico City and the liberals were using supplies that the American army ""lost"" over their border. Maximilian and the liberals would fight on 2 years after the American civil war ended.   So, TLDR: Mexico had its own issues to deal with during the American Civil war, they were dealing with their own invading force and weren't in a position to invade anyone else."

It should also be noted that Mexico had abolished slavery in the early 1800's, with it first being declared in 1810, formally abolished in 1820, and included in the 1824 constitution. The order to abolish slavery in Mexican Texas in 1830 is seen as one (of the many) causes of the Texas revolution. Based on this, they might be more willing to side with the Union (depending on when the joined the war), with the condition that they get at least part of Texas and maybe the Arizona Territory in exchange (although the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 would probably muddy that issue)."

In 1863, they launch a surprise invasion of California and try to negotiate an alliance with the Confederacy. The catch is that the CSA must cede nearly all of Texas to Mexico and relinquish any claim to the Arizona and New Mexico Territories. After loosing at Gettysburg and Vicksburg the CSA reluctantly agrees. The French want to stay neutral in the war but provide Mexico with a strong fleet to be crewed by Mexican sailors. It's not enough to destroy the Union blockade in the Atlantic but does challenge its control of the Gulf. The Mexicans also acquire arms from Europe and sell them the to the Confederacy. This is the full extent of military cooperation though. The Mexicans only interest is to keep the Americans fighting each other for as long as possible to end their advantage in sheer manpower.  By 1864, the Mexican flag is flying over San Francisco. Lincoln and the Republicans are staring down defeat in the coming election. Some in the federal government believe the US has to decide weather it wants the South or the West.  The Democrats end up winning in a landslide. The Union first offers a truce with the South which includes a repeal of the Emancipation Proclamation and a constitutional amendment declaring that slavery will remain legal for the next fifty years. President Davis presents the terms to the Confederate Congress and urges its acceptance. It's rejected as the idea of independence has become too strong. A few more months of fighting go by and the Union is nowhere near any kind of victory. Now it tries with Mexico and cedes all former Mexican territory in exchange for it ending all support to the South.  Even without Mexican support, the South holds on for a couple of years. By 1866, the Union has reestablished the blockade and taken control of the Mississippi. In 1867, a peace treaty is reached in which the south rejoins the Union, amnesty and full voting rights will be granted to all former confederates, and slavery with gradually end by 1880.  After the war is over, the US and Mexico enter into a cold war. Each sides tries to goad native tribes into attacking the other. The US secretly sends aid to republican and secessionist revolutionaries. Eventually, the two countries will go back to fighting again early in the 20th century."

France establishes the Empire of Mexico and appoint Maximilian as Emperor, though Max won't be in Mexico until 1864. France transfers the French units into the imperial guard. They announce that it's out of Mexico.   The U.S. says this is a falsehood and attacks French troops in Southern California. France declares war in August of '62.

England and France are too tied up fighting each other. Portugal is making too much money from its trade routes around the Cape of Good Hope to bother with sending explorers west.  Lucrative trade with the Portuguese lead Chinese merchants to believe they can cut out the middleman and trade directly with Europe for higher profits. An expedition follows the Kuroshio Current and sails into Puget Sound. After encountering the Salish, the Portuguese guides they brought with them realize they are not in Europe. Still, the Chinese traders try to make the best of the situation and trade their goods for various pelts and maybe some turquoise that got brought up the trade routes from further south. Back in China, the furs become a hit with the Imperial Court and sets off a fashion trend which drives merchants to set up permanent trading posts around Puget Sound, the Columbia River, and San Francisco Bay. These trade posts become quite large but their population is transient and few women reside there. Over time, a permanent population begins to appear but by this time the indigenous tribes have recovered, somewhat, from with shock of Eurasian diseases. The communities become enclaves within the framework of the various tribes that have grown rich off trading between the Chinese and the inland tribes. Their new found wealth causes them to have increased labor specializations which in turn causes the creation of something that we might call nation-states (though not in the European sense). The Chinese enclaves would also start to see themselves as autonomous from China and become city-states unto themselves and only paying lip service to the Emperor."

HistoryWhatIf,3cq5uh,Mahler5,5,Thu Jul 9 21:54:08 2015 UTC,"In this timeline let's assume that the idea of a common Italian cultural identity and society emerges during the Renaissance, even if regional identities remain stronger. This prompts Venice and Genoa to use their vast wealth to begin conquering NE and NW Italy respectively. Florence, not wanting to be left behind, begins doing the same in Tuscany. The Papacy is also strongly in favor of this idea because it will cut the HRE out of Italy entirely, and threatens excommunication on any ruler who intervenes in the peninsula. This, combined with generous gifts from the merchant republics to HRE, allows the three factions to form a de facto alliance against France which effectively blocks them from expanding their influence westward.  By around the mid 1500s Venice and Genoa realize that their merchant power is becoming eclipsed by the Atlantic trade and set aside their old rivalry to form the Confederazione delle Repubbliche whose territory looks like this. Internally they continue to function as two separate states other than the abolition of trade protections and unification of foreign policy. With their economy and market access now effectively doubled their is a small economic boom period that helps reduce suspicions amongst the population. In order to consolidate their hold on Italy (at this time southern Italy is still not included in the term) the new confederation uses the funds from this boom to attack Florence with the goal of reestablishing a republic and adding Tuscany as a third republic in the confederation. At this point Florence has abandoned republicanism and established an alliance with France, so to ensure non-interference Savoy, Aosta, and Corsica are given to the French. Florence falls and a new Tuscan republic is formed with the Confederation's territory now looking like this.  In the early 1600s the Confederation, inspired by the likes of Marco Polo and Matteo Ricci, starts sending trade ships to China but these ventures are a failure because of Chinese insistence on receiving bullion and the lack of easy access to the Atlantic. Not wanting to be shut out of Asian trade the Confederation decides to force the Ottoman Empire out of Egypt so that a Red Sea port can be secured. The Pope is brought into the fold by the promise of a free city of Alexandria jointly ruled between the Confederation and Papacy (which wishes to reform the Patriarchy under Catholic rule). With the aid of Papal diplomacy a coalition is formed with Austria and Spain where the former will gain port cities along the North African coast in modern-day Algeria and the latter land in the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire is already in a period of stagnation with weak rulers allowing the powerful coalition to achieve a smashing victory at sea and enough success on land that the initial war goals are fulfilled, albeit Austria feels shortchanged because they don't have much success in their campaign and so receive less.  This sparks a rivalry with Austria that forces the Confederation to devote significant resources on the continent to maintain security against them and a still unfriendly France. Because of this the Confederacy's colonization of the Indian ocean looks very similar to the old Venetian model (and OTL Portugal) with a focus on taking fortified coastal cities that facilitate trade and resupply ships but influence never extends inland. Despite this the geographic range is large with cities ranging down the East African coast and as far east as the Philippines. The only area that sees extensive settler colonization is New Zealand (called Nuova Liguria) after having been first discovered and claimed by a genovese explorer. Egypt also sees a good deal of immigration but Italians never come close to a majority, and to appease the populace forced conversions to Catholicism are quickly abandoned.  The Enlightenment doesn't have as radical an effect on the Confederation as on other countries because it is already made up of republics, and the only major change is increased enfranchisement and protections against an oligarchism. Nuova Liguria is added as an equal republic under the confederation and remains so because it is already allowed control over its domestic affairs. Into the modern age the Confederation falls behind northern European powers due to a lack resources (i.e. coal) and the inherently less centralized state making industrialization slower, but it remains a great power. Into the 21st century the republics have a similar standard of living as modern day Northern Italy."

At the POD (early-mid 1300s) the idea of 'Italy' only encompassed the areas north of Rome so the Confederation would see no reason to conquer it. They would be even less inclined after the conquest of Egypt because the Nile basin could then provide all the extra grain (and eventually cotton) that would be needed.   Culturally the two regions would also diverge even more than in OTL. A 'standard' Italian would develop in the Confederation much quicker than OTL because of the increased trade and combined military/supra-national government. This would mean that by the modern age the idea of a united peninsular Italy would be no more relevant than the idea of a united Iberia in OTL.

Let's see.  Probably fewer weather variations.  Possibly no tropical storms at all, since it takes the long summer days to power them.  OTOH, if there are hurricanes, then they'd be year-round events, rather than seasonal.  Without those variations, plants can adapt supremely to their particular day/night rhythm, temperature, and rainfall patterns, rather than having to survive under a broad range of conditions.  Perversely, this makes it much harder for them to spread.  Jack of all trades, master of none, that kind of thing.  So human agriculture would involve trying to introduce more diversity (so we can grow the same crops in different areas) into our domesticated crops, instead of IRL which tended more towards specializing them to the farming calendar.  I suppose there would still be long-term cycles, ice ages and the like, but I don't know enough about them to say how they would be affected.  Without seasons, no seasonal migrations of animals.  Herds and flocks would still move en masse, but only to find new feeding grounds.  I predict larger animals populations overall, but as a result they are perpetually at risk from overgrazing.  Likewise no seasonal breeding cycles.  Social animals might collectively pick a time, but it would be totally detached from anything else.  For humans, the development of agriculture (though as I said, spreading it across latitudes and climates gets trickier) becomes much easier, since you can grow the same stuff year-round without having to switch by season or stockpile outside the growing season.  So farmings-based civilization grows to higher levels much faster, but the higher populations are at greater risk of the usual Malthusian catastrophes until food transport can sustain any shortfalls."
HistoryWhatIf,3cl86p,Obermarschall,11,Wed Jul 8 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"Its relationship with other ideologies of its day were complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported private property rights and the profit motive of capitalism, but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by consolidating power with the state; they shared many goals with and often allied with the conservatives of their day, and often recruited from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more modern ideology, with less focus on things like traditional religion. Fascism opposed the egalitarian and international character of mainstream socialism, but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative ""national"" socialism; it strongly opposed liberalism, Communism, and democratic socialism, but shared with Bolshevism a common contempt for liberal democracy, individualism, and parliamentarism, sometimes allying itself with it as a result.   Fascism is complex as an ideology.

Sure, current nations won't call themselves Fascist.  But, that's not to say that the ideas of fascism, scaled down and applied selectively, aren't impractical.  Sorry, that's a digression from my main point.  I think my point was that Communism as practiced and Fascism as practiced seemed to have a lot in common.

Some details on who got the main chunk of profits, or if profits exist, but to the average worker it turned out the same: you were mining ore, smelting ingots, and hammering out 10,000 tanks because the Ruling Elite wanted tanks.  And if you needed more iron ingots for tank-building, then you got them, because it was necessary.  You didn't have to compete at market prices for iron ingots against people making frying pans and tractors.  So to me, this seems like the kind of government that an culture would create, that most recently had strong monarchy as their government plan.  Well, guess what, both Germany and Russia were ruled by (metaphorical) Roman Emperors.  Kaiser and Tzar both are the local translation of ""Ceasar"".  So in Communism we just have a Rule by the Proletariat window dressing on the new empire; and in Fascism we have an Aryan Master Race window dressing on the new empire.  Both systems are Empirical, they've just replaced the one guy at the top, with a council of ruling elites.  So to me it isn't much different what system either Germany or Russia pick.  Even if they both pick Fascism or Communism, they will still eventually fight each other.  Like nearby sports teams, you hate the rival."

I could actually see them spreading the communist ideology successfully because they had all the prerequisite s for a successful communism(very industrialised/rich in industry).

Communism is generally more focused on the proletariat, the workers, industry, and on technology while Fascism in generally more focused on Militarism and Nationalism. The Fascist groups in early 20th century Russia were too weak and not unified  or centralized. The Fascists would have fought with the Whites who were not centralized and very unorganized.

It's easier to unite a Fascist system if everyone shares a nationality whereas Communism is based on the idea of state-controlled economic homogeny. Soviet translates literally to 'council' because of the councils of workers that formed during the early 1910s. Germany was and still is homogenous and could more easily foster either Communism of Fascism. A Fascist would aim to create a homogenous Russia united as ethnic Russians solely while Communists (while still being nationalistic, less so than Fascists) aimed to unite everyone as workers or proletarians. Pan-Germanism is easy to foster in a place where almost 95% of people consider themselves German. Pan-Russianism is difficult to foster in a country where maybe 66% consider themselves 'Slavs"". There are dozens of different types of slavs - Polish, Czech, Slovak, Slovene, Croatian, Serbian, Bosno-Herzgovin, Montenegrin, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Ukranian, Belarusian, Russian and so on.

The only reason they stayed united was based on a proletarian dictatorship. The Soviets came to power by prolonged war and economic reforms. Germany was able to do it with nationalism. The Soviets tried to form an ethnic union but the differences between all the ethnicities in Russia would have made it difficult to form a unified Fascist movement. Look at it this way, if you said ""let's form a government based mainly on nationalism (Fascism)"", there would be tons of opposition by people in the Russian Empire/USSR that did feel like they belonged with a Russian nationalist movement but if you said ""let's form a government under an economy that gives back to all its people equally"", that would make much more sense for all the people of different ethnicities."

Even Apaches have been reportedly shot down by small arms fire, and the Mogadishu militia were shooting RPGs. I don't think Apaches would have stood up to the fire much better than the Black Hawks, but even that is somewhat beside the point.  I think part of the reason that the Black Hawks were getting hit in the first place is that they were orbiting around the battle area, following each other around in circles. Their movements were somewhat predictable, in other words. Unless that plan was changed, they would still be vulnerable regardless of whether they were escorted by Apaches or MH-6 Little Birds. I don't recall why the Black Hawks were kept on station like that, since the plan was to exfiltrate by ground convoy.  Once everything had gone to pot, the Apache could have provided extra firepower to keep the Somalis at bay, which would have been useful during the night when the Rangers had hunkered down to wait for evacuation. As it happened though, the MH-6s proved adequate and the Rangers were not overrun.   I don't see what the Apaches could have done above and beyond what the Little Birds did. The Apache could carry more of the same kind of rockets (Hydra 70s), and had a 30mm cannon instead of the MH-6's 7.62mm minigun pods (I think that was their loadout anyway, could be wrong). The 30mm is kind of huge, designed for killing armored vehicles; it might be a bit dangerous to use in very close support of troops on the ground, and judging by gun camera footage I've seen, it's not super precise. The Apache may have had more advanced sensors; I know they've got a thermal camera, whereas I think the MH-6 crew was limited to what their own night vision goggles could see. Even so, in a cluttered urban environment, those sensors might not have been of much use.

Looking at the situation in western europe from a few sources I understand the argument.   the Eastern empire had far more cities where trade and manufacture was going on. Western empire had a few cities, like in Italy that were trade and manufacture centers, but the bulk of their cities were administration centers where bishops and generals and governors worked. The economy of the west was mostly farms and farms don't generate a huge amount of wealth, especially since the eastern empire had Egypt which was just a bonanza of food production.   The western empire was a money sink. money would flow into it, rather than out of it. Conquering it would go against the reasons for conquest of the era which was plunder. The Romans never conquered Germany since there wasn't much to plunder, certainly not enough plunder to bother with fighting Germans for it.   Soldiers need pay, they don't like it when they don't get paid and they have weapons and know how to fight. Smart leaders don't piss off their military if they can help it.   So, there are two ways I can think of to make this reconquest happen in the face of this economic quagmire the west was.   First, pseudo- feudalism. I have read that it was quite common to pay soldiers with large land grants in the conquered areas. So Justinian could have paid off his soldiers in lands, and since they were not that great, he would sweeten the deal with political authority. The lands would be roman empire lands, under the Emperor, but a General would be granted a province  and his best men would be granted large precincts within them based on merit.   They would be required to defend it out of their own resources with aid from the Emperor and be required to govern it (cheaper than paying a governor), within the context of Roman and Christian law.   The second option is Justinian builds cities. he does what Peter the Great did in russia and just draft people to move to these places with an Alexander the Great style city building campaign. Craftsmen and social elites would be enticed/ordered/sentenced to go live in London, Paris, Marseilles, where ever and build economic power there. Instead of these cities and regions costing money they would, hopefully, generate money.   This would have the added benefit of re-romanizing provinces that had become germano-latin in culture. It would also put the eastern christianity in supremacy across europe"

And also how to invent new technology to try and solve problems created by new technology.  Machine guns made cavalry obsolete.  But that didn't stop generals early on from trying to use men mounted on horses to try and charge the enemy.  The  result was a permanent drop in the horse population.  (In the 1920's the Jeep would be developed as a replacement for the horse, but that's a different story)  Groups of soldiers charging forward to try and take an enemy position also was tried and failed.    Fortifications, the reason why Germany had to go through Belgium in the first place, were not up to the new artillery pieces.   Huge guns were developed in the naval arms race with Britain, but the same huge guns were able to be broken down and transported and re-assembled and could reduce the effectiveness of a fortification.  Machine guns and artillery gave just too darn much power to the defense.  Also the Germans plan was for a quick war with France and then wheel around and fight Russia.  Well, the German forces got bogged down in Belgium and later France, and they stayed there for four years.  If you could somehow give the Germans (future) historical information about how the war turned out, and details of the mistakes and innovations made by both the Entente and Central Powers, then yeah, Germany could have come up with a completely different plan and done things differently from the start.   Don't let get Britain involved.  Or give them an excuse.  The British Naval blockade really took a toll on Germany.   Stay out of Belgium.  It's muddy and it will make the British angry. Start your invasion of France head on, but use infiltration tactics instead of mass attacks first off.  Position heavy artillery to take out the French fortresses and then use light infantry to move in quickly and capture/neutralize the forts. Use chemical weapons first and heavily before your opponent figures out counter-measures. Use airplanes as spotters early. Quickly develop air-combat technologies and tactics.  Use them against enemy spotters. Food.  My god Germany you need way more food than you think.  The fact that you thought it would be a short war and turned out to be a multi-year siege made everyone starve.  And that got them paranoid about food, and a generation later some clever guy exploited the idea of food insecurity to get you to try and conquer more territory for farming.   Submarines.  Damn, Germany, you think of some clever stuff.  Submarines can take out battleships. If the British do decide to engage with their navy, use submarine warfare against them mercilessly.

HistoryWhatIf,3cf3kg,Citrus_Fish,5,Wed Jul 8 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"Good question.  During WW1, Lenin was an unemployed dude living over a sausage shop in Switzerland.    WW1 had been going badly for some time.  It was supposed to be a nine-month affair and done. Yet it turned into a huge slug-fest between the nations of Europe.  Entire nation states mobilized their economies to feed their war machine.  In order to defeat a country's army, you had to defeat the country itself.  Russia was using the ""throw soldiers at the enemy"" tactics and doing a good job of it.  Soldiers were dying very efficiently in WW1 on all sides, and Russia was doing it's fair share of sending young men to the slaughterhouse.  This, as you might imagine, wasn't particularly popular.  Russia was previously organized as a monarchy, with Tzar Nicolas as the supreme commander of the country and army.  He was already ousted by February 1917.  But the provisional government, who was receiving international aid from the other Entente countries kept Russia in the war.    Because the provisional government felt obliged to stay in the war, there was still plenty of economic privation, and dead young men going on in Russia.  Still not popular.  So the German government helped Lenin get to the Russian capital in St. Petersburg.  So Germany hoped to send this revolutionary, charismatic, clever man to Russia to help destroy the country, and get Russia out of the war.  It worked.  But, Lenin's rhetoric made its way through the population quickly and had permeated the army well before the October revolution.  Communism's message that the wealthy elites exploited the poor, working class, and soldiers to do their bidding resonated well with soldiers in exactly that position.    What's more is that the Russian-German conflict zone was very different from the trench warfare that characterized the Western Front.  By 1917, German and Russian soldiers had plenty of contact with each other, and the ideas of Communism had spread to the low-ranks of German soldiers as well.  So Germany plants the meme Communism in Russia, in the hopes of bringing down that country.  And it works.  It also gets that meme spread back to itself.    Communism and particularly anti-Communist feelings were one of the causes of the rise of the National Socialist party in the late 1920's and early  1930's.  And Communism, as spread to Asia, helped kill ~55 million people due to Mao's policies.  So yeah, if Germany could just leave Lenin the heck alone, it might help things, at least in my opinion."

First I think that the Germans commuting to the schlieffen plan and invading through Belgium was a smart move.  Yes you brought Britain into the war but you would crush Belgium quick and the BEF would suffer defeats until the Marne.  Britian is not a problem if they can't fight in France.  I agree that using chemical warfare more often and sooner would better.  However, chemical warfare would be most effective the first few times so using it more would dampen its effect.  The first use of gas at the second battle if Ypre was devastating and if that effect happened sometime when there was more momentum behind the German army.    I think that submarines should have been used to target merchant ships heading to Britain and France.  If you target battleships two things will happen.  First you will accelerate the chance of convoys appearing which stop submarines from being as effective by providing more defence.  Second the British navy cracked German codes and knew if there would be a major naval attack (like Jutland).  There is very little chance that the German navy could compete with the royal navy.   I agree completely that the imcopatance if the Austrians had a major role in their lose.  Hotzendorf should never have had the position he had.

I think in this alternate time line it would be much easier to get the French to agree simply because they lost two major wars in the last 60 years.   But then again, losing two major wars in a row might also take the fight out of France. Also if WW1 ends in 1915 the Tsar might hold onto power in Russia, he might be forced to empower a Duma and be unable to revoke it's power making Imperial Russia a constitutional monarchy in the 1930s. No red scare which was one of the major issues causing fascism to rise.   A much shorter war would probably really nerf the economic problems of 1920 and 1930 preventing a massive depression which was another issue causing the rise of fascism (at least in Germany)   A short ww1 would also not dull the fangs of war so in the 1920s and 1930s we very well might have a series of short wars. A Polish revolution, for instance, where Constitutional Russia is forced to give Poland Independence in 1919.   The Austrian Empire might break down into Civil War and sides will be drawn in the Ottoman Empire's collapse as the Turks get overwhelmed by non Turks that they have been oppressing."
HistoryWhatIf,3cf3kg,ByzantineBomb,8,Tue Jul 7 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Have Italy side with the Central Powers. This opens a second front in France, drawing French to the south.   This also allows Austro-Hungarian troops that would have been used against Italy to be used against Russia and Serbia.   Also, the Austro-Hungarian and Italian Fleets would be able to engage the French and British fleets in the Mediterranean. I'm not talking about engaging in decisive naval action, but the Italians may attempt a rapid, amphibious invasion of Malta at the most. Otherwise, those fleets will just harass Entente shipping and likely deter any major amphibious assaults against Central Power territory.   Italians participation in the war on the Central Powers' side may alone not cause them to win but certainly would change the course of the war and post war geopolitics."
HistoryWhatIf,3cf3kg,Lonesome_Dreamer,3,Tue Jul 7 21:25:54 2015 UTC,"This was my thought as well. If the Italians had been persuaded to join the Central Powers (likely by Germany strong-arming Austria-Hungary into ceding ethnically Italian land in the Adriatic) then the Mediterranean would have become a heavily contested theatre. The Italians had desired Tunisia since the Scramble for Africa and likely would have made a serious effort to take it, and a combined Italo-Ottoman attack on Egypt would have been a headache for the British. If the Central Powers successfully took control of the Eastern Mediterranean it may have allowed the Ottomans to be more useful against the Russians and hastened their defeat (possibly with Italian aid) and allowed the Germans to pull their armies westward earlier.   Even if the Italians took no decisive action I think the swing in manpower you mention may have been enough to give the Germans an edge. Another factor is the food production of Southern Italy could have been modernized with German help which may have helped somewhat mitigate the effects of the blockade.  I also wonder what effect a Central Powers Italy may have had on US opinion of the war. The Germans were already a massive immigrant population and adding the Italians to that would have made for an interesting domestic situation."
HistoryWhatIf,3cf3kg,ByzantineBomb,3,Tue Jul 7 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"Italy was part of the Triple Alliance, the precursor to the Central Powers but did not join their cause because it saw the Triple Alliance was a defensive alliance, but Germany and Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive at the beginning of the war. Strong arming Austria-Hungary might not be necessary to get Italy to join the war, a simple reinterpretation of the Triple Alliance could have gotten Italy into the Central Powers.  An attack on Tunis is definitely possible, perhaps after Malta, as it could be used as a stepping soon for an invasion.   If the Central Powers were able to wrest control over the Eastern Mediterranean, this could mean German forces in East Africa could actually receive resupply and reinforcement, if only briefly. Those forces fought magnificently in OTL and with more support, could tie down and inflict more casualties on British forces.   I could see the Italians allying with Ethiopia and conducting a joint invasion of Dijibouti and British Somalia. A successful invasion of Somalia would mean the British would loose uncontested control of the Bab-el-Mandeb. And if the Turks managed to push to the Suez, British grasp on India would start to loosen and troops and supplies coming to and from the subcontinent would be forced to go around Africa instead."

There was a serious lack of communication between the two armies that were the spearhead of the German offensive and the British rather stumbled in between them and not only stopped the advance within miles of Paris but also sent the Germans retreating. Right before this battle Von Moltke the younger would transfer divisions off his spearhead and send them to the east to fight Russia. Also, it would have strengthened the central powers if Italy would have joined.  They did not do very well fighting with the entant but I believe that much like the Austrians and the Turks German support could lead to at least a stable front that France would have the deal with. Also, I believe that if the Germans had fully committed to unrestricted submarine warfare they may have done more damage to the British."

If Germany had been more cautious about the application of the unrestricted warfare, I think it would have made a difference.  For example, it was widely known that the unrestricted submarine warfare was putting a significant strain on the UK's ability to get food and supplies to it people.  Couple that with the fact that on the Western front, a stalemate of sorts had developed with the huge armies of the Germans and the French/British stalled out with neither army gaining any significant ground.  At that point, I believe that the sides would have come together to sue for peace, with Germany gaining territory in France and coming out the winner.  But what happened was that Germany was careless at times with their unrestricted submarine warfare and sunk ships with American citizens and assets on board.  America could not ignore these affronts to their sovereignty and got involved in the war."

So If I recall correctly, they had a range of about 100 meters of accuracy (smooth bore muzzle loaders). They were equally drilled. The armor wouldn't be of use against the guns meaning the Napoleonic troops were more maneuverable but when in melee combat they would be at a disadvantage.   I will assume that these Phalanx hopelites are familiar with firearms so the explosions don't cause them to run for the hills.   If we have 1000 of each type of soldiers, using their standard tactics (which is where I start getting really fuzzy since I don't know the formations of napoelonic era soldiers...) I would imagine the front of the napoleonic guys would be wider than the phalanx which was 8X8 or 16X16 depending on whose you used.   The Phalanx would be smaller targets but taking fire from a distance. They would march into the napoleonic line and with longer range spears compared to the bayonet of the musket.   The question becomes how many hopelites fall and how solid their formations can remain.

Japanese expansionism against China eventually prompted FDR to enact an oil embargo that caused Japan to attack Pearl Harbour and strike out at British and Dutch holdings to seize the resources they needed to continue their war in China.   The lack of conflict in China would mean no Xi'an incident in 1936 to force Chiang Kai-Shek to form a shaky alliance with the Communists and instead continue to whittle them down or ultimately break them in 1937 or '38 as German trained divisions are completed and tested in battle.    With no war in China, Germany is more inclined to continue aiding them in exchange for more tungsten and antimony until 1939 when the outbreak of war renders it almost impossible to complete these transactions. Though the KMT now have a solid forty divisions of reliable troops that can easily outperform warlord troops and enjoy the support of a little more modernized industry. These new divisions are also a credible threat to Japanese forces, though they are a light on artillery with very few aircraft and tanks.   The fact that the KMT are becoming this strong might see Japan aiding other warlord states as they did in reality to upset the balance of power in China or agitate an incident to invade Manchuria but face the possibility of things spiralling into full scale war against a much more confident and able Chinese army. But this could be ended with an uneasy ceasefire brokered by Germany or the USA to protect their own interests in the region as the strength of the improved Chinese forces would give them a stronger hand at the negotiating table.    American involvement in WWII is still possible as there was an undeclared conflict with German U-Boats to help materiel aid reach the UK but it would ultimately delay full on war until enough US naval losses see public opinion swing in favour of war. The late entry to the war in Europe would see the Soviets controlling more of Europe if they receive Lend Lease in time as D-Day would be a riskier and later undertaking with less experienced American forces. But of course, this hinges on FDR still being able to nudge America onto a less neutral footing, otherwise, the Soviets will be in for a much longer struggle without Lend Lease and the UK unable to do little but eventually secure North Africa and continue night time strategic bombing in support of the Soviets.

HistoryWhatIf,3cdy6v,SurviAvi,2,Tue Jul 7 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"At the time of the Black Death, Europe was in the Hundred Years Wars, which reduced France to the condition of some modern African civil war, just without the blood diamonds. Roaming bands of unemployed mercenaries during the truces kept life hell. Few women weren't raped in their life. Then came the Black Death, killing one-tenth the population in the north, more like one-quarter in the south.  Now, before we consider the effects, we must note that Black Death was a recurring pestilence through the rest of the Middle Ages, thru the entire Renaissance, and was part of the Early Modern period. The Great Plague of London was 1665, the last European outbreak was 1720. Constantinople had outbreaks a late as 1800, & Bagdhad once lost two-thirds of its population. "" The Third plague pandemic (1855–1859) started in China in the middle of the 19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone. ...Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia in 1900–25 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney.""  So the Black Death is not this time-limited singular event.  My guess at results is that we may have a Two Hundred Years War, spreading farther across the continent. Nation states will be slower to grow, feudalism will survive longer, and secular humanism will not be kicked off by the loss of faith in a traditional Catholic faith that could never explain why God visited these waves of death on the populace. Also, general and medical science may suffer without the scramble for treatments leading to everyone trying to find how to deal with the situation.  Leprosy will remain common in Europe. The Hansen's disease sufferers, already ill, were quickly killed off by plague. Plague after plague, those without genetic resistance to leprosy went, until the Europeans left are very resistant to it.  There will be fewer Jews and later Rom massacred, accused of poisoning wells and otherwise causing plague.  I see greater stagnation in a more crowded and violent Old World. Life actually becomes cheap: peasants are a dime a dozen. I see Europeans less adventurous. By 1500, death was so common and unexpected that you might as well take chances, with the chance for fame and fortune, before the inevitable and possibly sudden end. There will be fewer explorers and fewer colonists for a long time, until the colonies seem safe. They will invent bicycle helmets much earlier, possibly for horsemen.  They will contact the New World at a later time, perhaps when more politically stable and not having a plague of its own.  China may not be so isolationist with plague trauma. They might cautiously extend across the north, even setting up fur trade with the natives of the farther coast (people forget that the Chinese loved good furs). Asian coastal powers may war in the Pacific Northwest over trading rights."

In a treaty that was made at Canandaigua, New York, 10 years later, the Iroquois and the United States each pledged not to disturb the other in lands that had been relinquished or reserved. Of the Six Nations, the Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora remained in New York, eventually settling on reservations; the Mohawk and Cayuga withdrew to Canada; and, a generation later, a large group of the Oneida departed for Wisconsin.""         But I'll give you a shot anyway.          After the War of 1812, the Congress of the United States realized that it might be prudent to establish a Native American 'buffer state' between the United States and Canada to forestall any future attempts from the British to ""sweep down"" from Canada.  Although a treaty had been drawn up almost twenty years before, drawing the lines ""for all time"" between the burgeoning American republic and the defeated Native Americans, the Mohawk, in particular, were quick to take advantage of this unexpected opening. Negotiations were opened between among the three  sides, and, by late 1815, an area extending north of the historic border of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire to the St. Lawrence Seaway (Canadian land) and extending that border east to the Atlantic Ocean (the wild north-lands of Maine -- American land) is established in perpetuity as the 'Eastern Homeland of the Native Americans'.        This amiable resolution to a thorny historical problem -- the invasion of the North American landmass by Europeans, and the subsequent displacement of millions of Native Americans -- pleases everyone, and subsequently leads to the establishment of the four other Homelands: 'Northern Homeland' (north of the state we now know as Dakota, and bordering Alberta), the 'Southwestern Homeland' (that area east of Arizona and west of Texas, that borders Mexico), 'Southeastern Homeland' (that area south of Carolina and north of Florida), and the 'Western Homeland' (the area north of Oregon, and south of British Columbia). Despite their geographic separation, the Five Homelands are, nevertheless, recognized by the United Nations as the 'Native American Homelands' and are administrated as a single sovereign entity.           Although these Homelands have endured controversy from time to time, (providing shelter for escaped slaves, for example), they are now seen as a shining example of the principle of self-representation and self-government."

HistoryWhatIf,3cdamu,IwillMasticateYou,19,Tue Jul 7 00:43:34 2015 UTC,"If the CSA gets their win-condition of evicting federal officers and maintaining their slavery-protecting government, they probably due so through a series of bad luck and mistakes on the part of the USA. It's enough to cost Lincoln re-election on 1864, except that with the loss of the South, he's a damn lock even so.  The Republicans likely take the opportunity to reshape the USA to match their purposes, pushing multiple amendments to reform the USA's government to have a more unitary character in the federal government. The South doesn't need to amend anything: Since the CSA is founded on state secession from the federal government, it's clear any state can do so. The USA's highest government becomes supreme while the CSA's is hollow.  For a generation at least things are tense with the CSA, not the least due to the extremely irregular border the two countries share. By 1880 they probably have to have agreements (the USA still refuses to recognize the CSA as an independent nation) to alter the old state borders so that the demarcation between the two countries follows a smoother course.  The USA rapidly expands west into the old Mexican territories, While Texas marks the limit of the CSA's ability to grow.  The CSA is economically stagnant. Slavery continues to impoverish the majority of whites and blacks in the South, especially as Europeans continue raising tariffs on slave-produced goods. Whites without slaves, particularly skilled workers, leave to join the USA, creating significant brain drain away from Southern businesses and universities. Confederate politicians recognize the problem, but their national government is too weak to do anything about it. The slave-owning class scapegoats with continuous allegations of Northerners and blacks sabotaging the Southern economy.   Enslaved blacks continually escape despite very harsh responses. They flee into the American West and into Mexico. This creates an international expat group that hates the home regime, like OTL Cubans who founded Castro-hating groups in Florida.   By 1900 the USA's economy has multiplied several times while the CSA has held steady or even shrank - real wages have fallen. The USA's railroads run from sea to shining sea, while the CSA is stuck trading with the few powers left to buy their cotton in Europe.   The CSA, riddled with the view that foreign meddlers are keeping it down, gets itself into a disastrous war with the Spanish Empire over Cuba. The Spanish-Confederate War lasts from 1900 to 1903 and ends with a bloody Spanish Victory (assisted in large part by American material support and unofficial volunteers). Spain seizes nearly all of Florida and effectively destroys New Orleans. Confederate aggression also marks the end of all Southern cotton sales in Europe.  Some Southerners, angry at the CSA and their own states for their stupid war with Spain, begin a ""city secession"" movement: Towns and cities begin seceding from both their states and the CSA. So-called Sovereign Cities refuse to pay state or confederate taxes and evict such officials. This triggers a decade of intermittent civil war in the CSA.  At the outbreak of a very different World War One, the CSA is a shadow of itself. It is only a collection of various plantation-owners who come together in their ""Congress"" in what is effectively a bitter social club. Most large cities have become Sovereign Cities, and many of those have independently abolished slavery."

HistoryWhatIf,3cdamu,UnsealedSpiral,6,Tue Jul 7 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"I think you were looking good until the Spanish-Confederate War.  I think the US would insist on pushing the Monroe Doctrine even after the secession of the CS, and that means that Spain wouldn't be allowed to actually acquire territory in the Western Hemisphere without risking war with the US.  More likely, in my opinion, is a massive extraction of tribute from the CS in precious metals, weaponry, and machine tools (most of it woefully obsolete by European standards, but Spain could really use anything it can get, at least to sell off for profit to other powers).  By the time Spain's through with them, the CS will have nothing left but cotton...  Which brings us to the imminent failure of the cotton economy due to the Boll Weevil, after which your post-war CSA would disintegrate totally by 1920 and either get overthrown by newly unemployed slaves or petition the US for re-annexation.  Those ""Sovereign Cities"" might, in part, join the US, or, depending on how northern culture develops (Prohibition?) become Las Vegas- or Amsterdam-like Free Cities where wealthy Americans go to indulge in forbidden pleasures."
HistoryWhatIf,3cdamu,LIPCSB__,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:37:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Monroe Doctrine would figure into this scenario since Cuba and PR were already pre-established Spanish colonies which had practiced slavery until about the late 1870s. The CSA would have attempted to prop up their position by expanding their ""Empire of Slavery"" into the Caribbean and then Central America. Cuban rebels had been fighting the Spanish for independence since 68, but they were anti-slavery - so little chance the CSA would back them up. CSA might make an attempt to buy Cuba but the Spanish would reject. I only see this happening if the CSA intervenes in the struggle between the Spanish & Cubans under the pretext of protecting CSA interests on the island, disingenuously side with the Cubans, fight a much harder war against a stronger Spain than the US did in 98, and then sideline the Cubans in the end and establish a CSA pro-slavery territory than becomes a springboard to PR and DR. This has to happen between 68-78 to work.  On a side note, if the CSA supports the French in Mexico, they might keep France as a trade partner, and they get a buffer state that would let them launch filibuster adventures into Central America with the aim of adding for territory and all the wealth than may come from bananas, coffee, and sugar."

HistoryWhatIf,3cdamu,SpeciousArguments,5,Tue Jul 7 07:28:10 2015 UTC,"The economic power of the North could not be matched. The only thing that threatened victory was the political will in the North to fight, as well as Lincoln's personal vision of a united country. The war had plenty of dissenters in the North from beginning to end who would have rather seen the South go free than try to fight them over it. The Election of 1864 was not a free ride for Lincoln by any means. The Civil War for Americans was much like WW1 for European -- everyone enjoyed the spectacle, gallantry, and glory of it all, but they were also naive about the horrors of war as brought about by inventions like photography (scenes of death and carnage reproducible and shared with all, not just the eyewitnesses), and the Gatling gun (which engendered early trench warfare as a fundamental shift away from more traditional rank and file battle lines, etc).  Thus, every battle was not just important militarily or economically, in terms of depletion of manpower or denial of land access or resources; there was a significant political and morale component as well.  If the South had been able to extract a few more key victories, especially in the middle of the game, the North's public opinion could have turned irretrievably against the war and Lincoln by proxy. There might not have been an Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln would have lost reelection to an antiwar candidate, and a negotiated armistice with the South would have been pursued by the North with an interest toward ending a war that, to save face, would be spoken of as a conflict that very few in the North ""actually"" really wanted and which should've never been fought. There would be disillusionment and hostility to government like America's Vietnam Conflict except a hundred years in advance."

I don't agree   Now we're going to say that Lee's 1st invasion was successful, destroying or scattering the federals. And capturing DC. Before DC fell, Lincoln orders the army of Tennessee and other smaller forces out west to send veteran units. Cutting western armies to the bone. The CS counter attack in the western theater and push back the much weakened Union.   The rebuilt army of Potomac is forced to attack DC. They fail. Huge public outcry. A general armistice is called, Lincoln loses in '64, war over.   Now that hostilities are over, Britain and France recognize the south and work out trade deals, even completing the secret warship contracts they had going. The CSS Stonewall is delivered in early '65.   In the North, animosity is short lived, as the black question is now no longer in their hands, and the federal government now is more cohesive without southern trouble makers. The north continues to move west.  The same is in the south and trade begins to pick up. Veteran-adventurers begin to organize themselves into clubs. Plantation owners need new lands to expand into. The owners, politicians and veterans all come to the same conclusion; expansion will make me rich.  Turning to the example of the patron saint of Filibusterers, William Walker, Veterans, armed by the government and paid by the owners, settle in numerous areas; Haiti, Cuba etc. usually settling in and around the capital and major port. Either becoming the slight majority or powerful minority.   Pick a fight with the local government, claim corruption and take over. Generally the Filibusterers become very wealthy, by seizing preestablished plantations.   By the 1880's world opinion has turned completely away from slave goods, Brazil freed its slaves, making the CS the last major power practicing.   Trade drops off, Congress is in hot debate over the issue of slavery. Some states are threatening secession. President Longstreet won't have that. Longstreet comes to the joint session bearing the Swords of General Lee and Washington. The men considered to be the Father and Grandfather of the Confederacy. He speaks of the bloodshed to free themselves of foreign rulers and that the Confederacy has two choices, close itself off from the world and whither on the vine or emancipate the slaves and honor the fallen.   A constitutional convention is called, riots break out but the militia puts order back. Blacks are made residents of the respective states and hold only basic rights.   President Longstreet's vp wins the election. President Andersen is the Owner of the Tredegar ironworks, the largest ironworks in the country.   The world is becoming industrial, and the president and his advisers know that the confederacy cannot even protect Caribbean states. The CS constitution prohibits federal construction of economic infrastructure, but it allows military infrastructure.   The federal government begins to build arsenals and ironworks and railway expansions, then lease some of those resources to private companies.   Now some senators claim that this is federal abuse but they shush up when the states with these programs begin to do very well.   In 1914, the world goes to war but both the South and North want nothing to do with it.   They openly trade with both sides. The CS navy escorts grain ships through the blockade into Germany.  In 1923, with the example of the newly formed USSR, black communists rise up. The black population was in some places greater than the white population.   It's a blood bath and both sides are brutal. By 1930 the war ends, the White government wins. The black population is decimated.   The ""nigger removal"" act is passed and the remaining population is shipped to the port cities. The CS navy and marines seize Liberia, the former U.S. Protectorate that was supposed to house returned slaves.   The blacks are shipped much in the same way they arrived in the first place.   The removal opened a lot of formerly occupied land for resettlement, the congress passes the homestead act where any man can claim up to 640 acres as long as he occupies it for 5 years and improves it. This resettlement helps homeless families.   The south rebuilds"

HistoryWhatIf,3ce4vt,radiodialdeath,2,Tue Jul 7 05:10:39 2015 UTC,"Just some thoughts from a history major that has taken a single Canadian History course.   What situation happened to allow them to keep it?   Well, let's assume that somehow, Thomas Pelham-Holles, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and William Pitt, a prominent member of Parliament at the time and who held several high-ranking positions, don't end up forming a coalition government and Thomas becomes the Prime Minister again. This leads to a focus on keeping the war in Europe, and Britain ignores France's colonies.   The war goes much better for Prussia, but Great Britain does not gain the massive colonial empire that it would have gotten. Instead, they get a large cash settlement that will offset most of the war-time costs. France's loss at home will send ripples across Europe, and the French Revolution will happen, potentially a few years sooner. From here on out, things get complicated.   What happens afterward? Does it remain in French control to modern day? Does it become independent at some point?   Well, immediately, the American Revolution either does not happen or it happens much later, if at all. The Proclamation of 1763 and the Quebec Act of 1764 aren't needed in order to pacify the Native Americans that sided with the French or to pacify the French-Canadians. The various tax acts aren't needed, so there is next to no discontent among the American colonists. They also have the entire western frontier open to them, so settlement pushed west by 1800 and ends at the Louisana River. This settlement push is partly an answer to the French Revolution. The question of slavery is raised, but the eventual Slavery Abolition Act 1833 puts that to rest. The American colonies stay a part of the British Empire until its collapse post-World War II, and they join the Commonwealth.  Yes, that's the alternate US, but they and Canada are intertwined after this war.  Anyways, to Quebec.  Quebec remains a part of France, and they take part in the French Revolution. At this point, they can either break free and be their own country, or continue on as a part of France. If they stay, then there is a possibility that the Napoleonic Wars also play out like Seven Years War, with England and France fighting each other across the globe. Again, this is another point that could end with Quebec being on its own or being with France. Let's assume that they stay.   Moving from here, the colony is maintained and French history goes on in a similar fashion as in our timeline. One big note of difference is that Napoleon III focuses his interventions in the New World in order to maintain his profitable colonies in the Caribbean. France once again gets their asses kicked in the Franco-Prussian War, and hostilities in Europe rise.   There is one major difference that has happened here that I must bring up: Prussia (now Germany) and England are even closer due to the support in the Seven Years War and the Anglo-Prussian Alliance never breaking down. They maintain their ties and the naval arms race that happened in our timeline leading up to World War I never happens in this time line.  Now, World War I.  England never forms the Triple Entente, and instead join with Germany, who is still allied with Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans. This leads to a much different WWI. Germany doesn't invade France through Belgium, and the Anglo-German forces force France into a two-front war. On the other side, Russia ends up fighting the Ottomans and Austria-Hungary alone, and then the Commies eventually take over much faster. In North America, there are battle lines across the border just like in Europe, and it is bloody. Here is another point that Quebec could leave, but again, let's say that Russia/France lose and there is a Treaty of Versailles, but this one screws over France. They could lose Quebec here, but instead they will lose their more profitable colonies and give Louisiana over to England, allowing them to push farther west. This push west didn't really need for a sort of Quebec Act since it was sparsely populated (except with farmers).  After this, France lingers on. They could try to sell Quebec to help pay for reparations, but it is in all honesty a really shitty colony (profit-wise), so no one buys it. France lingers on, and there is relative peace in Europe and the world. The fall of the colonial empires begin slightly earlier, but these colonies either stop being colones (and join their owner nation as an equal part) or they join something like the Commonwealth.  Jumping to modern day, France is in a pretty poor place. They were able to form a Commonwealth-like structure as their colonial empire fell apart, but other than that they are in a pretty poor place. Quebec remains a part of France."

There may be much more protests and revolts, and the Middle East might become as unstable as it is today - but during the Cold War. If all the Middle Eastern states can make it through, secularization could be a little bit faster, seeing that friendliness towards minorities can bridge sectarian gaps. To Israel, this may give them incentives to respond back to Arab kindness by being somewhat a little more friendly to their Palestinian counterparts. They get protests from the more zealous civilians who believe that the Arab's kindness is a sham, and that all non-Jews should be kicked out of the Jewish state. If Israel can pass through that, there could either be somewhat of a friendly rivalry between Israel and the Arab States (especially Palestine) - like how the UK and France, or Denmark/Finland and Sweden are today; or there could even be a chance for secularization to overcome the floodgates, and there could be a very sliver of a chance (although as likely as Canada and the US having another war against each other IRL) of both Israel and Palestine declaring a union - as there is no point to keep the Holy Land separated if all three religions can co-exist peacefully.

In either case, I don't think he'd have a much of a chance at the 1988 nomination because once a candidate gets the nomination and looses, they rarely get a second shot.    For the Democratic Party, it would do a lot to motivate their base and woo African American voters who were slowly moving to the right in the 90's. Clinton's share of the Black vote was about 82% in 92 (11% for Bush and 7% for Perot) and 84% in 96 (12% for Dole and 4% for Perot). By comparison, Mondale got about 89% and Dukakis got 88%. There was also a lot of apathy with the 96 election drawing in less than half of eligible voters for the first time since the number has been tracked (as far as I know). Jackson getting the nomination would show African Americans  and other minorities that the party elites were not taking their support for granted and bump up the percentage of the Black vote to be consistently above 90% and keep voter turnout high."

An end to the hostilities here would mean the Americans would be involved solely in the Pacific and possibly Lend Lease to the Soviets.   Germany would still have a tall order defeating the Soviets as Stalin may well have been less oblivious to invasion warnings now that the Axis had no secondary fronts to deal with.

Americans get the technology first and begin to apply it to their systems and with the Chinese not far behind, the second Cold war ends almost immediately, and now the world is left to deal with the surplus corn left behind.

Americans travel to join the fight, and within 2 years of fighting the Texan army reaches Santa Fe and Monterrey, effectively annexing any land North of the Rio Grande and as far west as the Navajo Territory.  Following the victory, the New Texan government invites veterans of the war to settle fertile land for farming and ranching. The Agrarians society develops around slaves but keeps close ties with Mexico and America. During the Mexican American war, Texas allies with America and receives Arizona as a prize. Treaties later declare the border of Texas-US at the 37th Paralell, from Missouri to California. During the civil war Texas remains neutral but several thousand Texans fight on both sides of the conflict.  When oil is discovered in the late 1870s, a boom occurs. The population triples in some cities and European migration skyrockets. Texan culture starts to become the dominating cultural sect. With this new money, the government invest in factories and a colony on the coast of Africa, around the Gold Coast the size of Switzerland.  After the boom, the Texas economy stabilizes and the military expands slightly. During independence wars in places like Puerto Rico and Cuba, Texas intervenes with the US and receives Puerto Rico as a spoil of war. Spanish culture is nearly wiped out on the island after so many years of war.  By the time the great war roles around, Texas is a booming economy on par with Germany and America for steel production, buying ore and selling it at a profit.

HistoryWhatIf,3ca55h,radiodialdeath,3,Wed Jul 8 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"July, 1839. Newly elected President of the Republic of Texas Mirabeau Lamar gets really sick of former President Sam Houston's ""meddling"", as he called it, in affairs of state and sends him to Europe with James Hamilton in order to aid James Pinckney Henderson's work in obtaining the diplomatic recognition all Texians wanted. At the very least, Lamar observed, it will make it easier to get the charter to move the capital to Waterloo without the current capital’s namesake constantly voicing his objections. The only problem there was what new name to give it that did not invoke Napoleon's defeat?  Houston's natural charisma and oratory skills make the team successful and gets the young, cash-strapped Republic back on its feet. How could King Louis-Philippe say “non” to the quick-witted and amiable charmer whose tales of life with the Cherokee were serialized in Le National and became coffee house talk across the rest of Europe? The five million francs into the Texian coffers was exactly what was needed to relieve the nascent nation of its crushing debt.   Even the British, though they were wary of negative influences on their American and Mexican relations, facilitated trade from the Republic at favourable duties and gave approval to an embassy in 1844. Diplomatic recognition, however, was was to wait until   Also necessary, many historians now say, were Houston’s newspaper royalties from those serializations, for he came to love French brandies almost as much as the French loved his stories. The incidents were mercifully kept hush-hush by the papers, for none wanted to be embargoed from the immensely popular stories. Who knows what damage would have been done to Texian negotiations had those stories came to public attention.  Alphonse Dubois de Saligny, the French chargé d'affaires whom Houston had sweet-talked into a favourable report when they met in New York City, returns in 1840 and sets up consuls in Austin, the new capital, and Galveston where the French loan madepossible the building of new port facilities. French trade starts preferentially flowing through Texas instead of the USA because of lower duties, as well as from French citizens in Mexico moving to Texas as a result of their long standing dispute for damages owed them since the so-called Pastry War.  Many French businessmen settled in Galveston to take advantage of the advantageous terms Houston, Henderson and Hamilton had conceded and today the French Quarter of Galveston rivals New Orleans as a tourist destination for those wishing to experience Old World charm in the New World.  Belgium and the Netherlands follow the French with recognition, trade and consuls and a Dutch loan. The Hanseatic cities in northern Germany, not to be out-done by the Dutch, also jump at a treaty with Texas as an entry to North American trade. Texian indigo-dyed cotton was to become a status symbol for the middle class and petty nobility all around the Baltic Sea.  Sam Houston’s triumphant return to Texas resulted in a landslide victory over David Burnet for a second term as president of the Republic. With the economy on the road to a sound financial footing and able to pay back the loans because of all the trade revenue and a booming economy, Sam Houston rebuffs renegade American President John Tyler's offer to reopen talks for Texian annexation. James Polk became the dark horse candidate for the Democratic nomination because of Martin van Buren’s anti-slavery stance and picked up support because of his support of Secretary of State Abel Upshur’s theory that Britain was pressing the Texians for emancipation. This, however, was not enough and though Polk won the nomination he lost the election to Henry Clay by a slim margin on the economic question. The idea of steady jobs even during recessions thanks to government public works projects to build roads, bridges, canals and railroads was ultimately more attractive to the American electorate than continued expansion. This was the death knell for the Jacksonian ideal of expansion and a twenty year domination of the Presidency by the Whigs until Abraham Lincoln’s win as the first president from the anti-slavery Republican Party in 1864. Lincoln however described himself as ""an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay"" and vowed extend the penetration of the American System into the Old South in order to speed the death of slavery. Kentucky and Missouri, and Delaware, where slaves were few and anti-slavery support was high, had already passed laws making slavery illegal shortly after Jon C. Frémont’s almost successful second run at the presidency in 1860, but in the remain of the South Lincoln was demonized by all but a minority.  Texian independence and success was to have profound consequences in the former Viceroyalty of New Spain.  Numerous other Mexican states revolted in 1835 against Santa Anna's Siete Leyes though only the Texians were successful that time.  On January 17, 1840 a meeting was held at the Oreveña Ranch near Laredo, Tamaulipas. A group of notables from the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas advocated a rebellion seeking secession from Mexico and formation of their own federal republic with Laredo as the capital. Pointing to the success of the Texians they are able to convince the state governments to sign on to the cause of independance. The new nation is called the Republic of the Río Grande. The state governments go along with it and appoint Antonio Canales, leader of teh notables, as their general over the states' militias. This allows Canales (plus a little Texian combat experience as leavening) to defeat Mexican generals Mariano Arista and Rafael Vasquez and their armies which are composed of, in typical Santa Anna fashion, convicts and forced draftees with a penchant for running away.  The Yucatán, which also had a fractious relationship with the central government, declares independence for a final time in 1846, ironically due to a post-Santa Anna government rejecting the 1843 agreement on Yucatecan autonomy. Texas, going to the main chance, is able to use it’s established relations in Europe to successfully advocate varyings levels of trade and diplomatic recognition for the Republic of the Río Grande and Republic of Yucatán, primarily convincing the European nations that the volume difficulties plaguing the port of Galveston can be overcome by expansion to Río Grandean and Yucatecan ports of Corpus Christi and Campeche.  The California Gold Rush starts, but after almost 15 years of increasing autonomy and home rule, the attempts to impose greater central control on Alta California to drain taxation- and economic-related monies from the gold rush back to the central government prompt Alta California to declare independence. Attempts are made to bring it to heel but are just as toothless and unsuccessful as all the bluster against Texas, Rio Grande and Yucatan was. Some adventurous Americans, but not many thanks to a solid Whig economy back home, join in with Europeans escaping the Revolutions of 1848 as well as Chileans, Mexicans and Chinese. Most Americans moving west prefer to settle in places like Portland and those that chose to emigrate mostly head north to the Columbia and Caledonia colonies of Britain. Still, the 150,000 new residents changes Alta California dramatically and set it off on the road to being the successful multicultural nation that today is often referred to as ""The Argentina of the North"".  Mexico refuses to recognize the four breakaways as anything other than rebellious provinces though internal conflicts make them unable to do much more than talk. Santa Anna remains in exile for almost a decade, returns in 1853 when the Conservative factionalistas invite him back and his autocratic style and its aftermath eventually throw the country into civil unrest and rebellion that erupts into actual civil war in 1858. The four Republics unofficially help the losers in the Mexican War of Reform and Leonardo Marquez's guerrilla operations after 1861. In order to stop Marquez and gain some solidity of control, President Benito Juarez agrees to a recognition of the four Republics in early 1862 as a concession to the British, French and Spanish fleets that had arrived off the coast of Veracruz after he suspended payment on debts from the civil war. Juarez is able to consolidate power by a combination of increased autonomy for the state legislatures to quell further conservative opposition, tariff policies favourable to the threatening nations in return for debt reduction and allowing investment from the breakaway Republics to kickstart the country's industry and agriculture decimated after five years of civil war. He continued his liberal reforms of Mexico until his death in office in 1872, by which time he had managed to almost completely turn things around. With urban Mexicans debating national identity, the rejection of indigenous cultures, a new passion for French culture, and the challenge of creating a modern nation by means of industrialization and scientific modernization was under way. Following Juarez's death, his successor's terms in office were only notable for the 1876 failed attempt at rebellion by a general-turned-minor-politician from Veracruz named Porfírio Díaz who had mistaken the bemoaning over changes in traditional ways as a lack of confidence in the continuation of the economic reforms of the so-called ""Juarezato"" faction of liberals.  Even though violent civilian confrontations and dictators are a thing of the past, Mexico remains plagued to this day with civil and economic unrest and corruption linked to continued infighting between the historical conservative and liberal factions. Its more industrialized and successful offspring maintain alternately cool and warm relations with Mexico dependent on negative sentiment over what the public calls ""Mexican paternalism"" and a desire to prop up Mexican stability for their own interests."

So the most likely scenario to make this work: In the year 1840, Mirabeau Lamar denounces his title as President and becomes a military dictator, incensing the Texas political elite. Other Texas elites (Sam Houston, Anson Jones, etc.) are told to get in line, leave, or hang. Texas secures a full military alliance with Great Britain, still the #1 enemy of the USA (something Lamar wanted during OT). This puts the USA and Texas at serious odds at each other.  Texas declares war on Mexico, seeking the lands of modern day New Mexico through California, securing land along the pacific coast. USA declares war on Texas, and Great Britain declares war on the USA in retaliation.  Texas in OT saw a lot of German immigration during this time. Lamar makes an offer to all Germans many can't refuse: Serve in the Texas military, and be given large tracts of land, a large salary, and pension. This sees a huge influx of German-speaking citizens, and German-speaking military regiments are formed.  Early successes by US forces capturing the port of Houston, and encircling Galveston (which was a huge profit center for Texas in the 19th century), and causing a naval blockade across the Gulf Coat make this seem incredibly one sided. However, the British navy breaks the blockade and lifts the siege against Galveston and Houston.  Once Texas immediate safety is secured, the British capture New Orleans. Canadians assault Detroit and upper New York.  In the Mexican theater, Texan forces march and torch the city of Monterrey. They slowly march towards Mexico City and take the city.   Texas/UK win the war. Texas wins modern day California, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona. The UK gains the Oregon Territory, as well as Utah and Nevada."

The middle class was nearly non existent compared to other European nations and the treatment of serfs was brutal. If you were Jewish pogroms were frequent and bloody. Some of that was starting to change - but only very slowly. And the change was often badly managed or actively crippled by the nobility to make life even worse sometimes.   To an 1860 serf the Russia of 1960 would have looked pretty darn good: enough food, much of it pretty decent. Good housing, education and healthcare provided by the state all orders of magnitude better than he ever had. Probably more freedom than he had too: at least he could apply to work or live somewhere else - the answer might be 'no' but it's better than a serf would get.   Sure, freedom of expression might be minimal - but pre soviet Russia wasn't exactly known for it - and the secret police brutal - but so was the Tsar's Okhrana.

Assuming an Umayyad victory, their next likely goal would have been Orléans, Versailles, Paris. Key cities all the way up to the Strait.  At this point an Anglo-Saxon England, and culturally related Gaelic nations would most likely have entered a union to prevent further northern expansion. Along with a strong Nordic and Germanic self-determination movement the Umayyad would have then faced a war on two fronts. Viking and English raiders would set the Gaullic coasts ablaze. It would become an existential fight for the northern nations.  This would be severally handicapping toward the Umayyad who would face the nations which 600 years prior had impeded Roman expansion north. I do not think the Umayyad would have been able to continue a successful campaign after Tours and after the Franks.

Once they eventually do get into Iberia, they could either push the Iberians back into Christianity and heavily influence them, or there would be a massive mix of Anglo-Saxons, Gaelic, Nordic, and Germanic groups co-existing with the now-native mix of Arabs and Andalusians who have converted to Christianity. Although, even if the Arabs and the Andalusians in Iberia were made Christian and had Islam practically become a minority religion, there would definitely be a little bit more Islamic influences on how the Arab-Andalusian cultures practice Christianity.  TL;DR - Gaul would be much more influenced by the Germanic, Norse, and Gaelic cultures; while Iberia would be (theoretically) split between a mixture of the Germanic, Norse, Gaelic, and native cultures, with their Christian practices being heavily influenced by their old pagan traditions and rituals up in the north; and a distinct Arab-Andalusian culture, with their Christian practices being heavily influenced by their old Muslim traditions and practices in the south.

He was too cautious at launching a full frontal attack.   The Frankish infantry was deadly. They were veterans under Charles command. The militia acted as fodder mostly, harassing the Muslims.  Al Râhman wanted to sack Tours and knew he would have to go through the Frankish line, so he charged up the hill, neglecting what would have been a decisive cavalry charge. As he got through the trees he was met with veteran infantry which decimated the Umayyad lines.

If you want Islamic Europe, try a POD where the Umayyads take Constantinople, either in 678 or 718. It's hard with the humongous walls that the Romans had, but I think with a Bulgar-Arab alliance and Muslims having the Greek Fire, and maybe with subterfuge on the part of the Caliphate, it's doable. But then that might lead to an early schism between the eastern, Persian part of the Caliphate and the western, more Roman part of the Caliphate, which leads to more butterflies.

HistoryWhatIf,3c802e,ForgingIron,3,Sun Jul 5 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"The North Atlantic Current now flows directly to the mouth of the Baltic. Scandinavia and the east baltic region are warmer and each climate zone is pushed up several hundred miles. The steppes of the Ukraine extend farther to the north, wrapping over the Carpathian's and extending north in a broad grassland west through to Normandy. There is significantly less forest land in the north of Germany.  When the Roman Empire begins pushing north of the Alps, it is able to push farther north before encountering more-difficult-to-colonize forest land. In the process of pushing north, substantial numbers of already-settled Celtic people are displaced or assimilated, and the character of Roman settlements in Gallia tends to be less Latin and more Celtic. Rome experiences the same internal difficulties, civil wars and the like, but a form of feudalism emerges in the colonized north of plantations, often with indentured workers of a separate more-Celtic identity. This lends a degree of stability for longer as rebellious nobles can be paid off with grants of land. Additionally, the costs of pacifying the British Isles is not present, and Roman finances are in greater order.  Several centuries later than OTL, the Roman Empire is instead primarily concerned with conquering eastward. However, the conquests of Persia and Ethiopia IITL are similarly difficult to the northern expedition OTL and similarly result in the same degree of imperial overextension. The greater resources and dominance over the Middle East means that Rome never has to co-opt Bedouin tribes as foederati and the conditions that allow the emergence of Islam, at the schism of two empires, do not exist in Arabia. Christianity emerges in the Levant apiece, but when it is adopted by the elite at the imperial level, it remains the faith of the elite in Gallia, rather than being used as a tool of co-optation, as with the Germanic tribes in OTL. While the colonial cities and landed nobles adopt Christianity as a means to participate in Roman politics, the Celtic laborers retain a great degree of folk religion.  When the major uprisings do come, as a result of worsening conditions on the fringes of the empire, they come instead from the southeastern fringe, rather than the northwest. Organized Persian, Nubian, and Ethiopian revolts spread across the Levant, perhaps somewhat informed by the memory of independence. Egypt, Arabia, the Levant, as well as the homelands of the recently conquered peoples fall in a matter of months, and as Roman authorities scramble to reinforce garrisons, and reconquer thoroughly Roman lands like Antioch, a conscription of Celtic laborers occurs. In the months it takes Rome to cobble together its rag tag army of conscripts, the eastern rebels entrench their positions, and what's more, establish themselves to a far greater degree than the Roman authorities had been able. While the restrictions of binding a large and diverse empire had left a disconnect between those in power and the locals of the east, the new conquerors were able to pacify and co-opt disenfranchised community leaders, particularly non-Latin and non-Christians, by offering greater autonomy and a greater share of power.   When Roman forces do land on the Egyptian and Levantine coasts, they are welcomed by the port cities which served as gateways to western markets. However, resistance is fierce pushing inland and cities like Tyre and Alexandria which had warmly anticipated the return of Pax Romana quickly lose patience with the drain on resources and lack of progress by the poorly trained, poorly equipped, and poorly led conscripts. The Roman military structures utterly fails to organize the indentured workers, who suffer from a great deal of language and cultural barriers to communications. Roman authorities are unable to reconquer any large swaths and are forced to sign treaties with the newly established kingdoms, winning only the return of several large port cities. The conscripts are shipped back to Gallia and expected to return to peaceful servitude of Roman agriculture, but they have now seen how weak Rome is and how across the empire, the body politic is chafing under the weight of Roman aristocracy."

Al-Andalus survives if they destroy the Visigoth kingdom of Asturias, they don't invade Gaul, and they give the Berbers equal rights and shares of the conquest.  After the fall of the Umayyad, a regional warlord would have most likely united the provinces into a single state. This state would have been a patron to the arts and science which could have rivaled Rome. They could have funded expeditions westward far earlier than 1500 and possibly become a major player in the geopolitics of west Europe. It would become a sanctuary for Jews and Muslims who wished to escape repression in north Europe. Muslim Iberia would be a super power until the English and French decided it was time to put down this rival.  As for the Caliphate of Córdoba, it would not end up as good. Even if Castile and Aragon did not declare war and left it be, they would face severe sanctions from their Christian neighbors. It would most likely end up as a third world nation or break up further into nothing but city states.  If it did not, then it would have a similar ending to Scotland. Unable to fund its own explorations in 1500, the Cordobans may decide to make a deal with the Spanish to get a cut of the action in the new world.

Never before had the empire been so weak but had never been so blessed by such a glorious succession of rulers.  When Michael VIII came to power *he was of deteriorating health and named is gregarious and able son Isaac as heir and Co Emperor. While His father went to restoring the capital from decades of abuse at the hands of filthy latins he sought to mend the broken realm. He managed to broker alliances and marriages with the Doukas and Kommineni families that brought Epirus and Trebizond back into the Empire by 1268. Between 1269 and 1278 when his father died he had dedicated tireless effort to reforming and training the army as best he could with its' limited resources. As Emperor he reigned for 40 years until his death at the age of 62 in 1308, and during that reign he reversed centuries of decline. He was fortuitous in that his rule shortly followed the breaking of Rum's power by invading Mongols. He pressed this advantage to stunning effect, managing to reconquer Asia Minor in 4 campaigns over the course of his reign. His gains in Europe were limited to the Greek Islands in the Aegean, Crete, and Cyprus as he played one European power against the others. By the end of his reign the Empire's borders were close to what they were in the 10th century, the military has established a top standard for the next several centuries, and the realm's finances were burgeoning.  Isaac's successors inherited much of his charm and cunning, and thus the next three centuries of Palaiologi rule saw constant territorial gains for the Empire.  1300s- Reconquest of the rest of the Crusader states in the area, repulse of the Timurids, and on and off wars with Mamaluk Egypt.  1400s- Ascendancy in the east, Full conquest of the Balkans and the breaking of Mamaluk power. Late century sees the break up of the Mamluk Empire and the Romans recapturing Bosnia and Croatia from Hungary.  1500s- the Caucasus region is Liberated from Islamic rule after the Qara Qoyunlu Sultanate is broken. Syria, the Holy Land, and Egypt are retaken. After these campaigns the Emperor Constantine the XIV holds the first triumphs in centuries.  In Europe, a final breaking of Hungarian power sees Roman cement influence over the ROmanian states and the absorption of Hungary by the growing power of Austria.   1600s- The empire reaches its' max territorial extent for the time period after campaigns against the Barbary coast pirates at the behest of Spanish Allies. Gains include the African Coast as far west as Algeria as well as the port of Tangiers. For their Help the Romans purchase colonial rights to La Florida, the Mosquito Coast, and Guadaloupe.   In the 1700s, Rome sees repeated conflicts with Austria over territory disputes as well as disputes with Safavid Persia that see small tracts of land change hands intermittently.   Meanwhile the Romans had their own scientific and cultural renaissance, both influenced by and influencing the Italian renaissance at the same time. The early period of the Palaiologoi dynasty saw great building projects that more or less rebuilt Constantinople as well as numerous other cities. The period also saw what many today claim to be genocide as the Romans sought to re-hellenize Asia Minor. Through Rome, the printing press and later ideas of enlightenment penetrated deeper into the middle east.   The late period of Imperial rule during the last quarter of the 1700s and the first of the 1800s saw a great deal of resentment brewing against autocracy. Increased literacy and education as well as a growing middle class of artisans and Bureaucrats caused many to idealize the old Republic. This was fueled by successful Revolutions in Great Britain's colonies as well as neighboring France and brought to a head after the Spice war with Persia and Great Britain that left the Empire nearly bankrupt and humiliated.  Then in 1812, the Roman people rose in revolt. While the revolution saw territorial loss as Colonials in the New world broke free, as did ROmanian Puppet states, Algeria, and Tunis. The majority of the Empire held together as the people of Rhomania took back their government.  It lasted for two years as a bloody conflict between Imperials and Republicans raged through the Balkans and Anatolia.

Without his death, his vastly unpopular ""Latin"" wife, Maria of Antioch, cannot come to power.  But unlike his predecessors, Manuel was a pro-western Emperor - his wife was from the west, he hosted western-style events such as jousting, and he allied himself with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Crusader States in the area, bringing them into the Byzantine sphere of influence.  His final years are spent fostering good relations with the Latin states, along with rebuilding the treasury that he has depleted with his many years of campaigning.  When he finally dies in 1190, he leaves behind a wealthy empire that has benefited greatly from the Komnenian restoration to his heir, Alexios II Komnenos.  Alexios II is betrothed to a French princess, securing Byzantium an alliance with France and ensuring further aid from the Latin forces in the area.   Soon after the ascension of Alexios II Komnenos in 1190 (Alexios is 21 years old when he is finally crowned Emperor), Isaac Komnenos, the aging brother to Manuel, stages a revolt on Cyprus and seizes the island from Imperial hands and proclaims himself Emperor and Alexios to be a pretender.  The response is swift - aided by Genoese and Venetian financial contributions, who do not trust Isaac for fear that he will raid their merchant ships, Alexios orders a large fleet of 100 Imperial warships to take back the island.  Although a sudden storm halts the landing progress at first, seven months into Isaac's rule, about 15,000 Imperial troops are on the island.  Isaac is swiftly arrested, blinded, and shipped off to Constantinople for execution on charges of treason.  Thus having faced his first enemy, Alexios II turns his attention towards the Anatolian borders, eager to finish the reconquest of the Roman heartland.  After the Roman defeat at Manzikret, Anatolia had not been regained.  However, in 1190, with the steady and strong hand of the Komnenian Emperors, Asia Minor had been regained piece by piece, with the only setback being suffered at the Battle of Myriokephalon.  Even so, the Imperial army had remained intact and with the command of Alexio's father, Manuel I, most of the units involved in the battle were at full strength and back in action on the frontier a year later.  However, Kiliji Arsan II, the Seljuk Sultan, also was back in action, and by 1191, most of the eastern frontier of the Empire was aflame.  Wasting no time to get afoot, Alexios dispatched the Megas Domestikos Theodore Laskaris into Anatolia at the head of an army with 60,000 soldiers, supplemented by a contingent of a further 10,000 provided by the Crusader states.  Arsan responds quickly, sending small bands to harass the advancing army and quickly raising a force of 55,000.  But there is one problem - Arsan is old and sickly, and he dies while en route to encounter the advancing Imperial force.  Having failed to clearly designate a successor, his sons squabble over command of the army until Kaykhusraw I takes charge.  But his brothers detest him, and leave the force in secret, lowering the size of the force to a mere 40,000.  The two armies meet near the city of Iconium on October 18th, 1192.  Kaykhusraw I opens up the battle by spreading his forces out and sending his calvary to attack the Imperial troops - Laskaris counters this by splitting his army into three, two on each flank of Kaykhusraw's force and one in front, and orders the Imperial troops to advance slowly.  Kaykhusraw replies by wheeling around the reserves on his left flank and having them attack directly into the Roman force, hoping to break the line between the left and center contingents.  Although the Turks are successful at first, a charge led by Prince Raymond of Tripoli quickly plugs up the hole and brings the Frankish knights into the fray.  Another charge by the Impeiral cataphracts smashes hard into the Turkish center, although the attack by the left wing is stalled.  During the fighting, Kaykhusraw is killed by a crossbow bolt, and his troops retreat back to Erzurum.  Having lost their only probable heir, the Seljuk Sultanate plunges into chaos and falls apart as each of Arslans sons begin to squabble over the remaining territory.  Investing Iconium, Laskaris retakes the city after a short siege and sends word to Alexios, before quickly destroying a nearby Turkish raiding force and returning to the capital with his force.    In Constantinople, Alexios is faced with a different problem - the Third Crusade is advancing, led by the formidable Richard the Lionheart, the French King Philip II, and Frederick Barbarossa.  Although he wishes to speedily get the Crusaders through his territory, he is presented with another threat - having neutralized the nascent Kingdom of Jerusalem to the south, Saladin hungrily eyes the Roman frontier and offers an alliance to the Romans.  The offer is rejected, and in late 1192, the Eastern Roman Empire takes the side of the Crusaders, and sends ambassadors to Barbarossa and Richard, promising them transportation and supplies if they promise a payment of 200,000 hyperpyra each, to enter into a military alliance, and promise to defend the Roman borders if they can.  Alexios is no fool - he knows that they will most probably break the second vow, but the treasury is still in a bad state after the campaigning of his father and he needs money to raise another army to counter Saladin.  Barbarossa and the Lionheart grudgingly accept - they see no other way to reach the Holy Land with their armies other than a Roman alliance, but the reaction of Philip is much more friendlier and open.  Philip is Alexio's brother-in-law, and with familial blood between them, he offers Alexios 5,000 Frankish soldiers to further supplement his army.  Alexios accepts the deal, garrisoning the troops in newly captured Iconium and dispatching Theodoro to Nikomedia with a force of 15,000 Imperial soldiers to supervise the crossing of the Crusader forces.  Although small skirmishes occasionally erupt between the Latins and the Romans, most of the crossing is done without incident, and the three large armies shadowed by a Roman force march into Seljuk territory.  wip"

If I assume rightly, there would have been very little chance of success.    The only chance would lie in secrecy, using merchant ships to transport the troops over.  Ireland or Scotland would be the best places to land because it would have been easier to find help from people also opposed to the crown, and supplies and more troops would be needed to take on Britain.  If they could garner enough support there, they might be able to then start conquering land in the traditional British territory starting from Scotland.    The biggest problem with the thought of the states invading Britain at that point in time is that the states were still very disorganized.  During the revolutionary war supplies were in constant demand by the troops because no one state wanted to foot the bill.  The articles of confederation helped some, but a strong federal government would be needed in order to take on a major world power in its own territory.  Remember that the states had trouble feeding and paying their troops in their own land, let alone a country across an ocean"

HistoryWhatIf,3bwwxq,Leecannon_,14,Thu Jul 2 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Lincoln didn't have a written plan for reconstruction but we can gather some good old fashioned assumptions through some statements he made in his presidency's later years.  “I want every man to have the chance — and I believe a black man is entitled to it ‑‑ in which he can better his condition,” Lincoln said in 1860 and in Lincoln’s world, economic opportunity was tied to the ownership of land, and the newly freed slaves owned none. Therefore, Lincoln likely would've followed through with the ""40 acres and a mule"" system.  A second Freedmen's Bureau Bill was debated by Congress in December 1865 but could not override Andrew Johnson's veto successfully until 1866, which Lincoln surely wouldn't have challenged in the first place. Lincoln wanted a ""War Democrat"" (pro-Union Dem) for his reelection to acquire more votes from moderates and Dems. The Party elected Andrew Johnson as his running mate for his reelection and had Lincoln have known of his imminent assassination, he would've stuck with his first term VP Hannibal Hamlin.  On the day of his assassination, Lincoln promised Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax that he planned to point Union veterans “to the gold and silver that waits for them in the West.” Turning the freedmen’s gaze westward would accomplish the same goal as the Freedmen’s Bureau. So if Lincoln wasn't assassinated, a greater effort for endeavors such as the Transcontinental Railroad would've been seen by Washington D.C..  Andrew Johnson had issued an amnesty proclamation to ordinary Southern citizens who swore loyalty oaths, promising not only political immunity but also return of confiscated property. (Johnson's proclamation excluded Confederate politicians, military officers, and landowners with property worth more than $20,000). Lincoln had no wish to hunt down the Confederacy’s leaders after the war ended, but he also had no wish to stop them leaving. “Frighten them out of the country,” he said, “open the gates, let down the bars … scare them off.” This would clear the way for a new leadership in the South, a leadership of Unionist white Americans and their natural allies, the freed slaves, which in turn would establish a “practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation.”  Johnson also tried to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1865, which would've failed if it wasn't for a chancy two-thirds majority override by Congress in 1866 (making it the CRA of 1866). Even though this bill was passed in real time, a living Lincoln not only would've been a lot more compromising with Congress but more ideologically in par with Congress. Lincoln proved time and time again an ability to work with the Radical Republicans (a caucus within the Republican Party), while Johnson was not.  Most importantly, I think if Lincoln lived the South would not have been able to substitute Jim Crow for slavery and Linconln would still have had to bulldoze his plans through the South but ultimately reconstruction would go a lot smoother."

Furthermore, even if the Bolshevik Revolution was successful, without WW2 (or at the very least without the WW2 of our timeline) I see no real way for the Soviet Union (or Russia in general) to gain control over much of Eastern Europe. Therefore I don't think there would be a Cold War at all.  Additionally, though I agree that the British Empire would remain intact well into the 21st Century, there would still likely be growing calls for their colonies to gain independence.

Perhaps World War I doesn't descend into trench warfare to the point it does OTL.  The other major issue is that, the reason England got involved in World War I was the treaty that was signed between Belgium and England that stated English protection of Belgian sovereignty.

Unlike England/Spain/Portugal/Netherlands/France they did not have direct access to the Atlantic. As for China I dont know enough about their situation at the time to comment.   Conquering territories as large as that is not possible without the population being decimated by germs.   Well see India and how that was colonised.   Well, correct me if I’m wrong (and I could easily be) but I should think that the Europeans success in colonizing most of Africa would offers a convenient example as to how better technology does win the day, despite greater numbers of defenders.   Not really a good example (as I said India would have been better). Africa still only has a population of 1.1 billion for the whole continent. It has a very low population density. It was easier to take over because large parts were unpopulated, or so thinly populated that Europeans could just take their land. And also some parts of Africa were never colonised by Europeans.  To never be colonised the Americas would need to have a large population and be technologically equal to (such as China) or slightly advanced (similar to Japan in the 1600's). But in the long run the Americas would be colonised but would be like Asian and African colonies of the great powers. It adopts some of the culture of their occupiers but never losses its non-whit majority. If the ethnic population of the Americas had not been wiped out with disease it would have been much harder to wipe them out by other means."

It would be a different and more complex process and involve making allies of some to fight others, but it could be done.   Even without the massive die-off caused by disease, the Americas populations was still just a fraction of Europe's. And of course, they don't have to take over all of the continent all at once in this scenario any more than they did on OTL - grab a small area, pacify it, expand, repeat. That's how all the older empires formed, so there's no reason it wouldn't work just as well here.  But it would be an Americas where a larger (much, much larger, in most areas) percentage of the ""European"" population would actually have native ancestors - think modern Mexico but with an even smaller European genetic contribution than on OTL.   It would probably also be an Americas where importing African slaves never happen, since the locals had the ""decency"" not to die off when being enslaved themselves."

Beyond that, I believe nations such as the Iroquois and Cherokee would quickly adapt and advance themselves, similar to how Japan modernized in the late 19th century, culminating with a series of wars that would be comparable to the Sino-Japanese War in the OTL.  After this, I believe rather than setting sail for Europe, the most modernized nations would turn against any neighbors lagging behind, and ultimately other nations of equal strength."
HistoryWhatIf,3bwr1s,Budelius,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"Well without the diseases to cause the eastern tribes to die, there would be a very large native population to meet the Europeans. Then depending on how the European settlers handled their interactions with the native groups near their settlements it could end up with a prosperous alliance, the destruction of the settlement, and/or alliances formed with the smaller tribes to get rid of a mutual enemy. Plus traveling between Europe and the America's at the time would take a couple of months depending on how the weather treated you too, so a lot could change in that time frame.  Now a reason for Europeans settling in further west when they came to N. America was due to the diseases wiping out the groups that lived there, and causing a misconception among the settlers that the natives didn't need this land, because they weren't using it.  I also have a difficult time seeing Native Americans using the land to advance their technology, because in my personal experiences (I am Navajo) from what I've heard from family is that we only take from the land what we need i.e. food, lumber, water, and medicine. Now I don't know what the viewpoint is from other tribes when it comes to using resources, but I believe that it's pretty similar among some if not most."

Some of the hire ups might  get spirited away to China (not officially though) and urge their troops to fight to the last man hoping that public opinion in South Korea and the US turns against the war. Assuming 9/11 goes as it did in the OTL, there are suspicions that the DPRK and Al-Qaeda are linked which the US doesn't specifically deny (""We haven't found a link...YET!""). This draws even more support for the war but the US does divert a significant number of troops to Afghanistan leaving the the war a mostly Korean affair. Pyongyang eventually falls along with the rest of the country. Upon victory, the Seoul government states its intentions to unify the peninsula under a democratic government. As post-war reconstruction begin, communist partisan attacks become a frequent problem especially with the surviving DPRK leaders urging them on from their secure location.

I don't think any country in the region would be willing to gamble away their sovereignty including states north Korea has an alliance with so it's not likely they will be receiving any kind of foreign aid militarily or commercially.  But than again there are resources in the region highly sought after from Chinese and other governments that all have intrests in capitalizing on the control of that country so as far resistance goes and accurately predicting the war it's self are hard to predict. On their own Nato forces could probably take most in not all of the country in a matter of a few months and that includes the logistical aspect of deployments and redistribution of military equipment and man power. It is unlikely that China will step in militarily the way they did in the first Korean War but if they did I'm not sure a war like that could be won. An attack like what you're talking about would never be carried out unless said general had guaranteed backing from a third party after the initial attack happened. It has a big potential to have the same out come accept this time north Korea's neighbor has the highest production rate and biggest economy in the world and not to mention a population almost a quarter of the world's population.

Because of the lack of free labor (slaves) that the South was now facing, the agricultural economy was failing.

And it would go from there.  Expanded opportunities for women also mean increased competition for men, who in response step up their game.

Absolute pacifism, vegetarianism, the rejection of marriage, and the belief that the physical world was evil were all part of their beliefs.   Catharism has been seen as giving women the greatest opportunities for independent action since women were found as being believers as well as Perfecti, who were able to administer the sacrament of the consolamentum. The Cathars believed that one would be repeatedly reincarnated until one commits to the self-denial of the material world, which meant that a man could be reincarnated as a woman and vice versa, thereby rendering gender completely meaningless. The spirit was of utmost importance to the Cathars and was described as being immaterial and sexless. Because of this belief, the Cathars saw women equally capable of being spiritual leaders, which undermined the very concept of gender held by the Catholic Church and did not go unnoticed   Can someone use the Albigensan Crusade as the branching point?  Either the Cathars win (unlikely), or the crusade never happens?  Perhaps after the murder of Pierre de Castelnau, the Pope threatens a crusade and Raymond of Toulouse negotiates reconciliation between the Cathar bishops and the Catholic Church, allowing them to retain some of their less heretical beliefs while still submitting to the church hierarchy.  Female priests in the year 1200, even if they were only accepted at first in southern France, would make a huge difference down the line."

NYC goes deep into red, cuts back many services, and ends up mired in decades of court battles with laid-off employees, unions, pension funds, etc. The ripples of unemployment spread through the State of New York, leading to a tremendous burden on the existing state social safety net. In the city, many schools close, buses start running late, etc.  NYC gets a (fair) reputation as an increasingly shitty place to live. Business don't want to operate their - no one wants to move to NYC if they can't find a good school for their kids!   Ford loses in 1976 for lots of reasons, still to Carter.  The city's deterioration takes years.   The 1977 blackout smashes the city hard. Instead of three days, it lasts in many areas for 2 weeks because of depleted city services and extensive rioting. Power disruptions also cause people to die from heat stroke, deprived of air conditioning. The Blackout becomes a blackmark against Carter, whose decision to send in federal troops to restore order was delayed by his dithering and was largely ineffective.   This begins the so-called ""Escape from New York""; through the late 1970s and continuing through all the 1980s, rich and middle class people flee the city. This creates a major brain and capital drain, plunging NYC into further economic ruin.  Many of these wealthy players resettle in other big cities, but plenty scatter across America's medium-sized cities. Other states and cities court big banks and investment groups with special tax breaks. Salt Lake City, Seattle, Madison, Las Vegas, Charleston, and others all become hubs of a new and diffuse financial sector.   The need for swift communication for these firms stimulates deeper private sector demand in telecom, leading to a robust public internet by the late 1980s rather than the mid-90s.   By the 1990s, NYC is much like modern OTL Detroit - a dying city. Many still live there, but the city's best days are behind it. The DOW and NASDAQ are long gone to other cities.

Nintendo never rises to power. Arcade machines remain as a nice little extra for bars and hamburger joints to go next to the pinball tables and basketball hoops. Atari stays well within their comfort zone, continuing to produce mostly arcade games, and not really innovating all that much with their tech. Competitors come and go, but they mostly just try to ape on Atari's game, and nobody Atari's as good as Atari. Developers who want to do more find themselves going to the PC, and as a result, their audience is significantly limited. PC is not widely adopted as a gaming platform due to the technology hurdle required to play, and the sometimes shoddy quality of the independently developed games for it. Beyond this, I can't confidently say. Maybe someone scraps together all the tech the Atari 12800 can muster and makes a simple, story based game. Maybe it's a big hit and this ushers in the ""modern"" age of gaming about 5 years late. Maybe it's a flop, and it cements the gaming console's status as a thing to play simple arcade distractions on, leaving gaming as a niche hobby in the same category as Airsoft or tabletop war-gaming.

Technologically, the incremental releases of the 8 bit NES and Master System, 16 bit Super Nintendo, TurboGrafx 16, and Genesis proceeding to later consoles wouldn't have been far more different as every single one of those manufacturers depended on outside suppliers for their CPUs and other components.    So there's a slightly different mish-mash of guts, and in the late 1980s and 1990s there's a different company's logo on the box then what happened OTL, but really, what's made in this scenario isn't that different from what happened.     The biggest difference is that consoles are mostly sold by American companies, and most of the games are American.  Instead of Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, it's Atari, Sony, and Microsoft--Atari only for its long term hegemony, altho I struggle to think of what would keep Atari alive after sooo many mis-steps (rushing games, the disaster that was the 5200, poor developer relations).   Maybe a management shakeup and investment from some mysterious company.  Nintendo has a console, but they're a niche player in America.  If Sega and NEC show up in the mid 1980s, they still crash and burn because of their own missteps by the mid-late 1990s--the NEC's crummy successor to the TurboGrafx, Sega's abject stupidity of the 32X and Saturn competing with themselves debacle.  Vectrex is dead by the fourth generation of 16 bit consoles as their vector systems and cost just are irrelevant by then.  Fairchild and Magnavox die off as their consoles just weren't that good.  Emerson releases their Arcadia, but nobody buys it and they too die.  The Bally Astrocade does not see a successor as its programming difficulties sour developers.    Intelevision and ColecoVision soldier on as two key players.  Eventually, Mattel and Coleco see their other core business, analog toys, struggling as the late 1990s carry on (we see a lot of weirdness like Nintendo's ROB show up by those companies, but nobody buys that stuff).  As Sony joins the market, Mattel and Coleco  join forces to focus on video games and release a new combined console, better compete with Sony, and split off their toy business.  Ultimately, it takes the Microsoft brand name when that company decides to enter the market in 2000ish.     So basically, if the videogame crash didn't happen, not much would be different.  There'd still be 3 consoles because that's what the market can support, and it's only 3 because Sony and Microsoft can throw their weight around."

This also ignores the fact that battles are not won sheerly on manpower, but on firepower and not a diffuse average, but on applied firepower used tactically at the strategic times.  That is something the Soviet's only accomplished toward the end of the war and well after the allies succeeded in drawing off Germany's resources toward other fronts, where they could depend both on numeric superiority and diverted german firepower.  The USSR's field armies were on the verge of defeat at Kursk, but Hitler refused his Generals calls to send reserves because of the Allied landings in Italy (occurring before D-Day).  Allied air raids might well balance serve to balance things out somewhat, but I'm not sure how much.

Later operation Bagration saw Germans completely outplayed on every level(which was admitted by several German generals themselves) and inflicted monstrous casualties.

Model (in the North) was moving South and Manstein (in the South) was moving North.  The Soviets directed most of their attention toward the North-sector, which meant that Model was the main one engaged, and  Zhukov aimed to seize Orel, which would leave Model cut off.  Manstein was not surprisingly making much better headway into the South than Model was headed North, the Soviet reserves in the South were too far back to be able to intervene effectively, and he managed to smash the Soviet defenses.  ""One of the elegant things about the pincer envelopment the Germans favored was that if one jaw succeeded, it would divert pressure from the other.""    So as the Soviets moved on Orel, they only became increasingly vulnerable to a sweep from the South, headed by Manstein, who had better forces, than the ones the Soviets committed the bulk of their forces against and ended up struggling against.  It was at this point that Hitler informed Manstein that the Allies had landed in Sicily and it was necessary for new armies in Italy and that they would need to come from the Eastern Front.... meaning that Operation Citadel had to be halted.  Manstein objected saying that the battle was at its culmination and that to break off now would be ""tantamount to throwing a victory away"".

Stalin forced engagements and attacks that the Soviet union was unable to sustain long term, including times where defense was the obvious strategic decision, as attacks would play to the German army's strength, rather than weakness.  The Germans where not some unbeatable force, but the Red Army suffered from a lack of usable doctrine, inexperienced commanders, and false reporting - given that Stalin had a tendency to shoot the messenger-, and lack of flexibility.

The goal of Soviets in Kursk was to wear down German armor through defensive attrition, which they succeeded in doing in both north and south. By the time Manstein's forces were threatening to achieve their objective, it was a shadow of what it was at the start, and would not be able to defend its gains against any determined counterattack.  Model's force had failed primarily because it was funneled by the terrain north of Kursk into a limited front, allowing Soviets to offer maximum resistance.  It is a verifiable fact that the massive soviet reserves were poised to respond to the situation south at moment's notice - famous battle of Prokhorovka occurred exactly because Soviet reserve 5th Guards Tank Army had resolved to attack.  And even though the counterattack did not achieve its tactical aims (destruction of German forces), it was a strategic success as it prevented Germans form securing any further objectives, and stopped the impetus of their attack.    I don't have much romantic feelings left towards German encirclements in Russia. From the memoirs of German generals it seems clear that while the pockets they created looked much more impressive on the maps, rather than in reality - huge distances and limited forces could not create solid blocking force to prevent breakouts. Often Soviets merely go to ground, let the Panzers pass, and then attacking their supply train, and HQ. Guderian and others often had close brushes with death in the East on the territories that supposed to be secure. And thus, the battered forces in Kursk would be hard pressed to create a solid defensive line.  Manpower of SU was certainly beginning to be a concern for them, but I see no evidence that situation was extremely serious.  Evidence of manpower sufficiency were the effectiveness of the Soviet operations after Kursk, Bagration in particular, which was a spectacular success.  Were the Soviet numbers inflated? Of course! It did not matter, the important point is that Soviets had strong reserves, Germans were largely throwing their last formations. All the criticism of the Soviet command you list was applicable till about 42, in some cases, 43. By the end of the year, however Red Army was a veteran, well oiled machine. Likely the most powerful army in the world. Again, success of Bagration is the best evidence for this.   As far as Manstein goes, I cannot claim to know his motivations, but I suspect his reluctance to cancel the Kursk offensive was due to the fact that he knew that it was the last opportunity to bring war in the East to any sort of acceptable conclusion. It was do or die."
HistoryWhatIf,3bluy8,ImaginaryStar,0,Mon Jul 6 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"Germans did not complete the encirclement because Blitzkrieg was never meant to work against the greatest series of fortifications in the world. Many German generals, such as Guderian, so called ""Father of Blitzkrieg"" argued against feasibility of the operation.   No argument regarding the uniqueness of Kursk from previous battles on the front.  The Russian salient was large and obvious.  Both sides knew what the other intended, and furthermore, due to geography juncture points of the salient were short.  No element of surprise could be achieved by the attackers.  Because there wasn't room for maneuver the only way success could be achieved would be for a powerful opening hit that destroys the enemy's defenses.  Both sides knew this and prepared for it.  Stalin ordered a defense in depth and Hitler built up firepower to achieve the initial smashes he needed.   By that point Russians grasped the German doctrine well enough.    Knowing something and being able to counter it are separate though.   The goal of Soviets in Kursk was to wear down German armor through defensive attrition, which they succeeded in doing in both north and south.    They did not.  Stalin and Zhukov guessing that the main offensive was going to be from the North, positioned most of the mobile reserves to strike there.  This was not the case and most heavy concentration of firepower was in the South with Manstein.  Despite this though Model was able to smash through an average of 15 kilometers in, ""deep enough to have ruptured the Soviet defenses"".  Official Soviet records gives the casualties of 177,547 and German records of their own losses puts their own number at 49,822.  A 3:1 loss ratio while defending a defense in depth is abysmal.  While the official record has Model stopping his attack as being a result of determined Soviet resistance, Model stopped because he had already penetrated the main defensive positions and would need to prepare for the next move, as well as the realization that the farther he moved forward at this point the more he risked a counter attack.  This follow up second surge was scheduled for July 12th.  But Zuchov moved on Orel first hoping to cut him off (because he had not been beaten off at all and was in position).  Model reacted by disengaging from the offensive to cover his flanks.  ""Based on his earlier campaigns against the Red Army, he apparently intended to beat off Kutuzov and then resume Citadel.""  ""He had good reason to assume that he could do this, because the main blow had already fallen on the southern hinge, where von Manstein had all the German super-units and the bulk of the heavy armor.""  ""Moreover, the Soviet reserves in the south were too far back to be able to intervene effectively.  By the time they were able to mount a counterattack, von Manstein had already smasshed through the Soviet defensive positions and was on the verge of breaking into the open.""  By July 11th, Zhuchov had committed most of his forces in an attempt to overpower Model and was unable to prevent Manstein from coming up from the Southern side of the salient, cutting off both the defenders in the salient and most of his armor.  As I quoted previously, ""One of the elegant things about the pincer envelopment the Germans favored was that if one jaw succeeded, it would divert pressure from the other.""  As the Soviets moved toward Orel they only became more vulnerable to Manstein.   By the time Manstein's forces were threatening to achieve their objective, it was a shadow of what it was at the start, and would not be able to defend its gains against any determined counterattack.    ""Although in most accounts of the fighting the  Germans are seen as too weakened, too exhausted, for this maneuver to be a possibility, the combat records of the key units involved do not support this claim.""  As late as July 17th the Germans had 107 tanks in action and where repairing others.  Furthermore some of the German's best armor, the Tigers, where still in action, which had more than proven their worth by annihilating all the armor the Soviets had tried to throw at them.  ""The evidence suggests that von Manstein's appreciation of the situation was correct. The heavy armored units were still intact, and they had shredded the Soviet tank force.  The Soviets subsequently admitted the loss of 4,253 tanks, 4,821 artillery pieces, and 1,563 aircraft during Kursk, the worst losses since the start of the war for any one operation.""  ""It is often said that journalist write the first draft of history.  Stalin went that aphorism one better: he was not only the chief actor, but he wrote the script.  Kursk may well be the first battle in history where one side declared itself the winner from the start of the engagement.""  ""Although for decades all analyses of the battle were based on the assumption that the German armor was fatally crippled, given the German records. and even the official Soviet figures, it is more probable that it was the other way around.  Curiously enough, despite the usual claims, the disposition of forces revealed by the map in the Soviet official history suggests that von Manstein's armored columns had nothing much standing between them and Vorenezh; Khrushchev, generally the most realistic of the senior Soviet leaders, was convinced that was the case.""  It is at this point that Hitler summoned Manstein back and stripped him of the resources necessary to finish off the Soviet armies that where out of position and pinned against Model, as he wanted to move resources down to prepare any Allied attacks on Italy or the Balkans.  This was achieved by not inviting Model to the conference and having Manstein argue solo against Hitler and Von Kluge who was distant from the scene, albeit still in charge, to not break off the attack.  Kluge then ordered Model to stop attacking (because he was not beaten).   I don't have much romantic feelings left towards German encirclements in Russia. From the memoirs of German generals it seems clear that while the pockets they created looked much more impressive on the maps, rather than in reality - huge distances and limited forces could not create solid blocking force to prevent breakouts.   Russia itself is vast, which meant that both sides had issues with a continuous front and their where plenty of opportunities on both sides to exploit gaps.  However you may feel about the German's ability to lock down an area, these exact offensives where what the German army used to inflict the astronomical casualties they accomplished on the Eastern front.  And had they continued here, there is no reason to think they would have done the same here.   Evidence of manpower sufficiency were the effectiveness of the Soviet operations after Kursk, Bagration in particular, which was a spectacular success.   These Soviet successes where only achieved after the Eastern front had been stripped, both of some of their best units (highest concentration of firepower, not all units were equal) and of the critical Luftwaffe support.  ""The army high command's concept of strategic defensive in the east, its ability to deliver what von Manstein had termed 'backhand strokes,' depended heavily on being able to move these core units to threatened sectors.  So when Hitler begin stripping them away, he not only ended any chance for offensive operations, he crippled the arm'y defensive capabilities as well. Without the powerful armored units, army group commanders lacked the mobile armored reserves that could snuff out Soviet units that broke through.""  Due to this the Germany army was forced to adapt the strategy of exchanging land for Soviet casualties.  ""The army was definitely sustaining losses, but the average monthly losses in 1943 were lower than in the first months of the war, and hardly different from the averages for the previous year.  The Wehrmacht had yet to see its annual death toll in the east exceed half a million, while on the Soviet side the number of soldiers killed in action in 1943 was higher than in 1942"".   Manpower of SU was certainly beginning to be a concern for them, but I see no evidence that situation was extremely serious. Evidence of manpower sufficiency were the effectiveness of the Soviet operations after Kursk, Bagration in particular, which was a spectacular success. Were the Soviet numbers inflated? Of course! It did not matter, the important point is that Soviets had strong reserves, Germans were largely throwing their last formations.   The Soviets couldn't afford to continue exchanging casualties higher than 2:1 which was the Soviet to German population ratio (obviously they did that at an even worse ratio, but the point is that was unsustainable, particularly in light of the millions they had already lost); however they continued to do so with continuous attacks that never managed to bring the manpower and the tanks needed to smash the German armies.  The Red Army was forming female units as early as December 1942 and not in auxiliary roles.  As time passed they were forced to add old men, teenagers, and men who in all other cases and militaries would have been judged unfit.  (edited a word)"

""up until the end of the war, Soviet tanks and infantry were so poorly coordinated, their operations so rarely synchronized, that their advances were nothing more than a series of lurches with noticeable pauses.  The erratic nature of their offensives thus allowed for further German retreats.  Consequently, German personal losses began to decline from their July 1943 high: December losses were only a little over 30,000 (dead), and had stabilized.  Although the Germans were steadily losing territory, they were hardly being routed.""   By the end of the year, however Red Army was a veteran, well oiled machine.   I don't doubt that had circumstances gone differently in the pre-war; most of the experienced military commanders siding with the whites and being executed (or having the chance to join forces with each other, which likely would have stopped the communists and would be a huge win for Russia), less communist suspicion of a professional  military, lack of purges, and the ability to speak freely to Stalin, things would not have gone nearly so well for the Germans.  But the fact is that the Soviet forces were entirely dependent on the Fronts that the Allies opened in order to start making meaningful gains.    Had things gone different prewar I don't thing the Germans would have gotten anywhere near where they did, but even at the end of the war the Russians had not overcome the deficiencies that the regime imposed on the Soviet people and ability of the Army."

North Africa may still go to the Allies but Europe is in Axis hands. The UK would most likely sue for peace and the Axis could then send most of their troops to the East front.   All in all, expect either an Axis victory or a stalemate, but the latter would still leave the Axis at an advantage."

It also tells me that of the first 1,450,000, about 812,000 were American and about 640,000 were British and Canadian. This is in contrast to the German forces of only about 380,000, to start.  If the Germans were unconcerned about America getting involved, they'd likely have had more of their troops in the east and fewer in Normandy. And with no American support, the Allies would probably have been more choosy about where to commit their troops (North Africa, Sicily, etc.) I think they could have made a go of it. They may have waited longer, until the Eastern Front was getting more desperate for the Germans, and more troops were pulled that way. While I agree that the liberation of France would have been slower, I think the Allies could have successfully opened up a second front in Europe, especially after learning what they did at Dieppe."

HistoryWhatIf,3bm6lj,PlatFleece,9,Tue Jun 30 10:01:58 2015 UTC,"For this to happen it seems like you would need to remove the will to colonize from Europe. People did not colonize the Americas just for fun, they had very strong reasons pushing them to leave Europe. Some simply sought more income through trade or plunder, others were fleeing religious persecution, and some just wanted land to live on. If we generalize a bit and say these are the primary reasons, you might could create a Europe where nobody wants to leave bad enough they actually do it.   One of the first driving forces for exploration was to seek out new trade routes to the East. Europeans wanted to cut out the middlemen on the Silk Road by traveling West around the globe directly to China and India. This is what drove Columbus, for example. So how do you stop Columbus? Simply having him die, or his fleet return home missing Hispaniola won't end the search for a Western passage, others would follow. You have to remove the need to seek the passage. This means Europeans need to dominate the Silk Road somehow. Perhaps the Black Death has ravaged longer and more deadly in the Middle East, greatly weakening the kingdoms there, allowing European merchants to exert more influence, in particular the Portuguese over the Ottomans. Perhaps the Crusades were far more successful as well and Crusader states and other small kingdoms dot the Middle East, further helping European trade. But this doesn't solve the problem of the long sea route, so someone needs to rebuild the Suez Canal early. The canal is literally just a big ditch, there is no reason they couldn't build it. The Pharaohs built one. Such a huge reduction in travel time would make any ideas of a Western Passage seem absurd.  What about religious persecution? Well these people only really thought of traveling to the new world after it had been discovered. They were unlikely to go seeking out new lands themselves. I think if nobody goes seeking out new profits and discovers the Americas by accident they probably stay at home and cope. Many would move into the new Crusader Kingdoms to repopulate the area with Christians.  The last group is most problematic, those seeking adventure and land. Europe was crowded for the time. Farming methods only allowed so much food to be grown. So you have to reduce the number of people in Europe drastically to make seeking new lands less desirable. I'd either submit that the Plague returned in Europe again, and more virulently, or perhaps it was so devastating to the Mid East that Europeans move en masse to the new Crusader states to settle. Perhaps the religiously persecuted move there as well. The continued Crusading would take care of the adventurous, and the open fertile lands would solve those seeking farms.  So how does Europe change to stop the age of Exploration? The Black Death returns to the Middle East with renewed vigor and devastates the population there, killing almost half the population by 1350. Europe, for unknown reasons, is spared from as much destruction. This pressure results in continued Crusading through the early 1360's, and most of the Holy Land, Egypt, and parts of modern Iraq in the hands of European vassal states. One state, in former Egypt, now controlled by Portugal, rebuilds the Suez Canal. It is finished in the 1450s. The Christian states in the Middle East, along with the control of the Suez destroys any ideas of a Western Passage. People were aware of the size of the globe, and it wouldn't make sense to go the long way anymore. The religiously persecuted and landless flock to the holy lands of the bible for settlement, displacing many of the local populace. Islam takes a pretty serious blow, but lives on in Iran and India.   But what about the New World? Well, eventually Somebody would figure out it was there. Some time in the 1600s or maybe even earlier someone would, at worst, land there on accident. People were probably fishing off the coast of Newfoundland for centuries and didn't realize it was anything other than just more islands near Greenland. So we cannot have the New World untouched forever, but you can make it last longer. At best you could hope the Europeans didn't really care about it at the time, but people will figure out that it is a vast untapped resource and they are going to want a piece of it. By the early 1700s North America is being colonized in some fashion. There is no reason to assume that Native American people would be any more ""advanced,"" technologically speaking, than they were upon discover in our time line.   The Native American people would probably fare far worse against the European colonizers than they did in OTL due to the even larger gap in material capabilities. The diseases would cause just as much destruction as they did before, but this time the advancing European powers would have more accurate and faster firing weapons and be able to travel from Europe and back far quicker with more people and supplies. If they are lucky they may adopt a more French style of colonization and view the Native American people as casual allies and trading partners, but not aggressively colonize. It is hard to speculate on the cultural outlook of a civilization that has veered hundreds of years off the OTL."
HistoryWhatIf,3bm6lj,nilhaus,3,Tue Jun 30 13:07:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. The fact that you probably need two plagues to stop Europe from coming to the Americas speaks a lot about how aggressively they wanted to colonize.  Do you think by the time the Europeans colonize the Americas that we'd have quite a different spread of the countries today (Canada, USA, Mexico) in the ATL modern world? If the same conflicts happen with more advanced weapons it could lead to a radically different outcome in the wars that shaped the territories there."
HistoryWhatIf,3bm6lj,nilhaus,2,Tue Jun 30 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"I think the New World colonies would be vastly different. Any European power would be able to get to the New World pretty reliably, not just those on the West coast. Most likely there would be more nations that bear little resemblance to their modern equivalents. These nations would be growing under a far more sophisticated centralized industrializing mother-nation.   Other interesting changes I thought about.    African slavery stays small and localized. There is little need for African slaves in the Middle East, India, or China. Those places are already full of workers. By the time Europeans begin colonizing the New World in the 1700s they would probably find the idea of chattel slavery to be too distasteful, assuming their morals evolve roughly as they did OTL. The British had been moving to end slavery in the late 1700s and did so in 1833. Perhaps indentured servitude survives longer than it did in OTL, but changes to economic systems mean it won't last forever.  India and China are in closer contact with Europeans much faster. China, which in OTL slowly dropped behind in military affairs by the late 1700s and never fortified its Eastern coast probably keeps par with Western ships and cannons, and strengthens its seaboard. China is likely to remain a strong nation assuming it does not come to open war with Europe. Even then I'd put my money on China pre 1700. A China-Russian border conflict would be a huge win for the Chinese. If it manages to strengthen itself and industrialize China would dominate the world economy by 1900. If they turn expansionist like Japan you could easily see all of Asia and the Pacific under the thumb of China. If China was fast enough they could claim some of the American West coast or Alaska. I don't know enough about pre-Modern India to really speculate, but they are going to be the target of every European nation from the 1500s onwards. Expansion, exploitation, warfare like in OTL but for longer and more intensely."

Maybe some Iberian trade posts to buy gold and silver and cocaine and furs from the Andeans and Mesoamericans and Eastern Americans. There's still be diseases among those groups, but likely not on the scale as IRL, but as native civilization advanced due to European technology the inner parts of the New World would meet smallpox and such.

This plague was virulent enough to make the Black Plague seem like a head cold. So if there was a delay in colonization, it would've allowed the locals to rebuild their numbers (or they wouldn't have caught it in the first place!) and be a much greater force to be reckoned with."

HistoryWhatIf,3bkftv,TreeDiagram,6,Tue Jun 30 03:29:03 2015 UTC,"Well Genoa actually wouldn't have kept Corsica most likely. In the years leading up to the sale of the claim to Corsica, there were a series of rebellions on the island in the interest of establishing a separate political entity. Genoa was heavily weakened from its war and subsequent succession by Austria a decade earlier, and when the Corsican rebellion began in the mid 1750s, it was unable to retain its control. Corsica would have probably remained a separate entity throughout France's military aggression during the late 1700s, since France mostly had its eyes on the land west of the Rhine and what is modern day northern Italy. I'm not really sure what Napoleon would have done in independent Corsica, since a lot of his military training and education was due to French ownership of Corsica. As outlined in my other post though, there would be a lack of much political foundation laid by Napoleonic France, France would have had a much different ending to the revolution, France's expansion during the late 1700s and early 1800s would not have been as drastic; Notably though, the sale of the French land claim in North America was done under Napoleonic rule in the interest of funding the wars in Europe, which might not have happened since a lot of the fervor in the populace for the Napoleonic wars was due to Napoleon's earlier victories predating his seizing the throne.  EDIT: I should also add that Corsica would have probably stayed independent until World War 2, where Italian expansion would have encompassed the island, as it did in current history. As to if Italy would have been forced to relinquish its land claims to the island after the war, I'm not sure."

The first matter is dating it. Radiometric dating would have been a brand new science, a discovery like this suggesting an 80 million year old tree was used to make a tool would call the whole practice of radiometric dating into question. It would be called a hoax, the artifacts might linger in museum drawers for years before anyone takes it seriously. The obvious question would be who built it and barring the discovery of fossilized skeletal remains that question would be impossible to answer. IF they weren't humans then a lot of assumptions about humans would be called into question, specifically the ideas of what made humans unique in the animal kingdom that were popular at the time. Anthropologists might look more kindly at our close cousins now that humans are at least the second civilization to have evolved on this planet. The discovery would also do some damage to evolutionary thought as it might be misconstrued as more evidence that evolution has a goal towards increased complexity, intelligence, and civilization. There are lizardmen illuminati conspiracy theories already based on zero evidence, with this cretaceous civilization out there the hollow-earth lizardmen UFO people might have something to stand on, or maybe the existence of concrete evidence of something would prevent all those 1950's spook stories from cropping up anyway."
HistoryWhatIf,3bk59a,Marcopolo325,10,Mon Jun 29 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"For one Napoleon would not have come to power as he did. Corsican by birth, his ability to rise quickly through the French military was in part due to his father's political connections in Corsica predating his birth, which extended into French Corsica. Although France had military ambitions at the time, the extent to which it was in history was largely due to the fervor and momentum drummed up by Napoleon's victories while an officer in the French army. Victories in modern day northern Italy increased support of the war, which increased morale and support of abroad Napoleon as a military leader, rinse, repeat. The outcome of the French Revolution would also have been considerably different, since the end of the reign of The Directory and the beginning of Napoleonic Dictatorship was due to the coup of 18 Brumaire, led by Napoleon and establishing him as first consul, which effectively ended the revolution.  For what would have happened with Spain, while Spain did have military ambitions at the time as well, it was obsolete in both leadership (parentage rather than merit based), and armament as well. Pre-Napoleonic France was a close ally with Spain, particularly against Britain, but this didn't continue into Napoleon ruled France, who betrayed the Spaniards after the invasion of Portugal. This wouldn't have occurred if it wasn't for Napoleon, since France sans Napoleon at the time would still be in the workings of the revolution, and had too little structure to orchestrate such a war.   I would probably think that under Spanish rule, Napoleon would have had similar ambitions, but without the unrest of the Revolution would not have been as realized, and probably have ended up as a military officer in wars against Portugal and Britain. France would have probably have been ironing out the revolution for years after, and eventually established a republic. A lot of French political structure would also be lacking, since much of the foundation after the revolution was formed by Napoleon or under Napoleonic rule.   tl;dr: France loses a great commander, French Revolution continues and many more people die. Spain gains a great military commander and Corsica, but probably wouldn't start a conquest of Europe due to a lack of good leadership and modern armament."
HistoryWhatIf,3bhdox,Solar_Pons,17,Mon Jun 29 06:05:55 2015 UTC,"Without Bismarck, German Unification never happens. Austria continues to dominate the german Bund, a loose confederation of german states.  Prussia never really develops colonial ambitions, leading to a much more cordial relationship with GB. GB and Prussia are both opposed to France.  Really it is much easier to say what wouldn't happen as a result of Bismarcks death then what wouldn't.  But we have a situation with France on one side and GB and Prussia on the other. To protect itself, France finds an unlikely Ally in Austria. Hostilities rise and inevitably lead to War sooner or later anytime between 1860 and 1880.  It isn't quite a World War: Russia sees no reason to participate, and most of Asia stays out as well.  While GB ties down France in the Colonies, Prussia leaves only a small defensive force in the West, and crushes Austria in a few months thanks to superior tactics and weaponry. Then Prussia turns around and takes Paris.  In Versailles, Wilhelm's advisors impress upon him the possibility of crowning himself Kaiser. But he does not. Instead the peace treaty is something like this:  France gives some Colonies to GB and Elsass-Lorraine to Prussia. Austria cedes Bohemia to Prussia.  Napoleon III is ousted in favour of a democratic government. Europe enjoys a short ammount of peace.  But when Wilhelm II (whose father had reigned for only a few months) takes power, things change. He is dissatisfied about the way his grandfather handled the peace and wished for Colonies for his Empire. He starts to build a fleet and claim colonies.  The British let him. Afterall the Prussians are trusted allies, and France, even after its previous humiliation is still the most feared power on the continent. And without France, there is much more space in Afrika and Asia anyway. Although the British insist that Prussia's fleet may never exceed half of the British in tonnage.  The French are looking to reclaim what they have lost, and make alliances with not only Austria, but also Russia. When sometime around 1900-1920 Wilhelm demands Schleswig-Holstein from the Danish, France guarantees them.  As a Result, Prussia mobilises. Within a week, Europe is embroiled in War. Prussia takes out Denmark quickly, but French Troops are already in Straßburg, and the Russian Bear is in the process of awakening as well, and in the south, Austria is about to march into Bohemia.  Prussia wastes no time and decides to crush France first. With the Help of GB, they manage to push the French back, but they cannot take Paris.  While the West develops into a trench-warfare stalemate, Russia advances on Königsberg. Prussian Forces are spread precariously thin, but manage to exploit a gap between two Russian Armies. They temporarily halt the advance, but fail to destroy one of them. Eventually, Russia takes Königsberg.  Meanwhile in the south, GB manages to bring Italy into the fight with promises of territory in southern Tyrol. The Austrians have to turn around and face the new threat, though they do take Bohemia.  Both Prussia and Austria demand the Bund members to join on their sides, but most stay neutral. Only Saxony joins Austria, and Hamburg Prussia. The others stay neutral.  With the west Front a stalemate, Prussia sends Troops East and manages to stableize the Front along the Oder River.  The situation is stable, but desperate for Prussia. Meanwhile in the Atlantic, the greatest Sea Battles in World History are happening between France and the Brito-Prussian Alliance (which I'll call the Allies from now on). The Prussians and British win decisively and Embargo France (whose coalition I will call the Entante from now on), also easily taking their remaining Colonies.  The British launch a diversionary attack on Sibiria, but the Russians simply retreat.  In the first new Spring of the War, the Entante launch a concerted attack on Prussia on both fronts. The Prussians have no reserves and fall back. The Entante suffer heavy losses though, and are unable to pursue far due to supply problems.  The Allied in the meantime have no grand plan to win the war, but are simply holding on for dear life, waiting for the blockades to take effect.  The American President suggests a peace treaty, but both sides decline. The Allies knowing that time is working in their favour and the Entante hoping the can march on Berlin and then force the British to a peace of their choosing.  The Summer goes by with more fruitless and disastrous offensives. Depening on exact dates and butterfly effects, tanks may be making their debut. Aircraft are almost ceirtainly in the skies overhead.  It's late now, so I will continue this tomorrow."
HistoryWhatIf,3bhdox,Prince_of_Savoy,2,Mon Jun 29 15:16:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for a fascinating response!  I was inspired by reading Kissinger's book Diplomacy, which makes Bismarck look on the one hand like a brilliant diplomatist and on the other the man who put Germany on the road to World Wars (and arguably putting Russia into the hands of Communists)  EDIT  My only other thought is that the Balkans, even w/o Bismarck, would still be smarting for their own rights, possibly undermining Austria's ability to aid France to a significant degree.  Russia, IIRC, is a big fan of using the ""infringed rights of Russian nationalists/Orthodox Christians"" in order to wedge itself into Eastern European power struggles.    My only real caveat with your theories is that GB repeatedly--in the French Revolution, in the early days of Napoleon, etc.--has avoided at great cost getting involved in continental wars, so even if they were allied to Prussia I can't imagine they would partake in an attack on France, especially in lieu of the entente which had begun under the auspices of Napoleon III.  I can't help wonder if GB wouldn't simply try to maintain a balance of power between France, Prussia, Russia, and Austria, throwing its weight against whichever side was behaving badly (particularly if Palmerston or Disraeli was in charge).  Then there's the economic factor--Germany was an industrial powerhouse, and I expect that the individual states--Prussia, Hesse, etc.--would have been just as economically driven, particularly in areas where GB lagged somewhat, such as chemicals, chemical engineering, and pharmaceuticals. (Aspirin is, after all, a German brand).  Would GB have seen those states as trading partners or industrial rivals?  For that matter, I wonder how other German states would view a Prussia which was essentially climbing over them to reach the rest of Europe--especially when England had such close dynastic ties to Hanover, while Russia was linked to Hesse.  Austria might have tried and allied herself with fellow Catholic German states--Bavaria and Wurttemberg, both which had strong inherited rulers--or even granted Italian independence in return for some sort of non-aggression pact (since Austria kept a thumb on northern Italy)...it's even possible that the threat of outside forces may have temporarily united the disparate nationalities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  At any rate, Italy would doubtless have united, but remain a military nonentity.  As to their colonial ambitions, I cannot say, as aside from their Abyssinean adventure in the 20th century  I know very little about their extra-European foreign policy.    Of course I started the scenario late in the 19th century, but without a unifying Bismarck it would be interesting to know how the revolutions of 1848 might have turned out, particularly in Prussia, although Czar Nicholas I would likely have smashed any real game changes in Prussia or Austria.  Austria particularly might have benefitted from Prince Metternich, who, though nowhere near as effective as he'd been at the Congress of Vienna, was still dangerous to ignore, especially without a Bismarck around.    I also wonder about the role of Socialism and growing political parties in German states, particularly Prussia.  The Socialist party in Germany in the late 19th century was growing in force.  This was the case in France as well, but Germany was far more bimodal than France--ie, there was less of a moderate middle, excepting Bismarck himself, who was a sort of  Richard Nixon in terms of domestic policy--right-wing, but pragmatic.  While the extreme-right wing Junkers were campaigning against Socialists,  Bismarck resolved the issue by adopting into his own administration numerous appeasing bones for Socialists to gnaw on, essentially leaving them to dissolve into a fringe.  In this reality, however, they maintain their visibility, and may thus make other movements, like anarchism and communism, less prominent.  At any rate,   In Russia I can't imagine much would have changed, aside from a more virulent Austrian repulsion of Russian interests in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.  In fact, Russia might have been seen, in the wake of the Crimean War and its attempts to remove GB from India, as a sort of European boogyman.  I'll assume Alexander II died from a terrorist bomb as before, and that his stupid, reactionary bull of a son, Alexander III, came again to power, thus leaving Russia in the hands of Nicholas II in the first parts of the 20th century.  But without the effects of WWI, it's very hard to say how the Russian government would have developed.  Possibly there would have been gradual move towards some sort of representative government, so long as no one moved too fast, but Russia being Russia, I wouldn't expect a lack of revolution to turn it into paradise.  Russia has never managed to stay democratic for very long, but if change occurred slowly enough, perhaps it could come to a sort of rough imitation that would give way to authenticity.    In terms of how all this might affect America...I can't help but think it would have lead to a radically different presidential lineup--namely, the return of Theodore Roosevelt.  Woodrow Wilson's 1916 election was largely won for his policy of avoiding war in Europe--Americans didn't want to take a risk on Charles Evans Hughes, the Republican candidate.  Roosevelt campaigned for Hughes, but to no effect, and Roosevelt himself was shattered shortly thereafter by the death of his son in WWI.  I think the alternative Roosevelt might have seen in Wilson easy prey, (a snooty academic who never fought in war!)  and, making up with the Republicans he broke from in the 1912 election, may well have made a triumphant return to power, having realized in his years out of office just what he'd been missing.  He would have certainly meddled in European politics, inevitably favoring England, and could well have been a proponent for a League of Nations prototype.    Without Germany, GB might have developed even closer ties to the Middle East, although some sort of colonial division-of-power treaty might have resulted, with spheres of influence accorded to the major European nations, including the Netherlands and Belgium.  I'm unsure as to what might change in the Far East, with Japan having defeated Russia in 1903 and becoming an industrial power in its own right."
HistoryWhatIf,3bhdox,Prince_of_Savoy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:01:34 2015 UTC,"All very good points.   About GB being opposed to intervention in Europe, you may be right. But on the other hand, in my opinion the more important factor in British foreign policy is balance of power on the continent. With France being viewed as the most powerful country and the primary rival in terms of colonies, GB is eager to prevent them form winning a major war on the continent."
HistoryWhatIf,3bhdox,Prince_of_Savoy,2,Tue Jun 30 12:59:13 2015 UTC,"continued.  In France, protests erupt at the seemingly fruitless waste of life of the previous few months. The nationalistic government that started the War is replaced (with some Allied help) with a leftist government willing to negotiate.  A seperate peace is arranged, based on the status quo. France looses no territory, but has to ratify the Annexation of Schleswig-Holstein.  The rest of the Entante keeps fighting. They still considerably outnumber the Allies. The Allies mount a counteroffensive with the goal of taking back eastern Prussia, but fail under heavy losses.  In a desperate attempt to gather Menpower, Wilhelm proclaims himself german Emperor, and orders all Germans to fight for him. A few northern states and individuals do. Austria denounces the move, declares it illegal and likewise orders any German to come to their Aid. With significant financial incentives, Bavaria joins the Entante camp.   The first Christmas in the Trenches brings attempts of fraternisation between the two parties, particularly the germans. The Christmas truce last for months in some places, as the officers have massive problems getting the soldiers to shoot each other again, particularly the germans. Increasingly, both the soldiers and the civilians feel that Germans should not kill Germans.  The next year remains a stalemate with disastrous losses on both sides. But while Austria and Russia can replace the men, Prussia cannot, even with British help. It has to increasingly fill the holes in its lines with worse and worse men. The draft age is soon lowered to 16. Then 15. Then 14. Wilhelm tries to negotiate a peace, but without informing Britain. They in turn feel betrayed, even if nothing comes of it.  The year after that, the Prussian line finally breaks after a concerted effort of Austria and Russia. Russians enter Berlin, but the Prussians resist firmly, while the Kaiser flees to Straßburg.  The British see the War lost, and have little qualm in asking for a peace treaty. The Entante agree. Britain looses no territory either.  As soon as the news reaches Berlin, it is clear the War is lost. The troops stop fighting and surrender en masse.  Wilhelm is powerless to do anything and surrenders.  The peace treaty that is negotiated in Vienna is this:  Wilhelm renounces his claims on the Imperial Crown of Germany and the royal Crown of Prussia. He is from now on merely the Duke of Brandenburg.  Eastern Prussia and Silesia is ceded to Russia, Bohemia back to Austria.  Westphalen is released as an independant nation under a Duke (who happens to be a Habsburg). Elsass-Lothringen is pronounced an independant republic.  Italy cedes some Terretories in the North to Austria and pays reprerations, but remains one unified country.  Several smaller Prussian Terretories are released either as free cities, or principalities.  The Great War is over. It has been disastrous, but not as much as WWI in OTL. It has lasted for 3 instead of 4 years, and it involved fewer beligerents.  What comes next? The spanish flue for sure, but beyond that who knows?  On the one hand we have a France that missed out on its share of the spoils because of leftist interference. The nationalists begin talking about their Army being stabed in the back on the brink of victory.  Germany remains a hodgepoge of smaller states, dominated by Austria. But how much longer will the German people accept this?   At this stage the butterfly effect takes over to make it utterly unpredictable. Does a ""French Hitler"" rise to demand back the Elsass, and if yes how will Austria react? Do Communists take over in Russia despite the succesful War? Do the people of Europe clamer for democracy after the monarchies have won?"
HistoryWhatIf,3bhdox,dr__professional,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:48:20 2015 UTC,"What a wonderful read this was!  My only qualm is whether or not the USA would have gotten involved, especially if Prussia was allied to GB--you could probably have worked up quite a bit of sympathy along those lines, what with the USA's large number of German immigrants and America's natural affinity with Britain.    Then again, perhaps America would have expanded its sphere of influence in the Far East while Europe was otherwise engaged.  But if TR was president, I have a hard time imagining he would be able to resist leaping into battle under some pretext or another.  ""America is the bully nephew of old Europe,"" he might say, ""and America does not shy from a fight when it means helping its family of nations.""    There was a saying in the late 20th century that ""only Nixon could go to China.""  The idea being that it was both a great irony and somehow appropriate that a man who built his political career on opposing Communism (and accusing his opponents of being ""soft on the Reds"") wound up making friends with the most populous Communist country on Earth, using a chill in Sino-Russian relations to leave Russia relatively weak by bringing China out of its years of isolation.    In much the same way, might Theodore Roosevelt--the man ""who at every wedding wished to be the bride, and at every funeral wished to be the corpse"" have gone to post-war Europe offering mediation and wind up founding a prototype of the League of Nations/United Nations?  Certainly TR would not have bothered unless he was convinced such a league would yield actual power, and would have relished good natured battles with men like David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau (assuming they are in charge in this reality)--men who had a hard time respecting the idealistic Wilson--possibly fostering American engagement, through its newfound Asian influences if nowhere else, and avoiding the isolationism propounded by politicians and celebrities such as Charles Lindbergh, which in our reality forced FDR into political contortions in order to aid Churchill's England against Hitler.     I agree the butterfly effect becomes stronger and stronger the farther we go--much to my disappointment.  If you believe that certain men dominate their eras--no matter how history flows--then men like Hitler, Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt would show up anyway, albeit in different forms.  I myself tend to give a bit more weight to the condition of the world, which, in this reality, may have been a much less dire place in the 1920's, 30's, and 40's than the one we know.    Without the collapse of the Hapsburg, Romanov, or Hohenzollern dynasties, the era of -isms (fascism, communism, etc.) might have been constrained by the forces of tradition one finds in monarchies.  Without an existing Communist nation, with the money and resources to stimulate Communists in other countries, who can say what would replace the Spanish Civil War?  Would China be the first country to become Communist, rather than Russia?    Without the postwar economic boom, would there have been a depression as horrific as the one experienced in the 1930's?  Certainly militaristic industrialization of the United States may not have occurred as rapidly without the impetus of WWI.  And atomic energy would almost certainly have been an entirely European creation, unless Russia or Austria or France force German scientists to flee even without the existence of Nazis.    It's also possible England would have failed to adopt the sorts of socialist programs it did--at least for the time being.  The British aristocracy was decimated by WWI--an entire generation educated from birth to enter parliament and take the reins of power was mowed down in trench warfare--accelerating a century's worth of natural drift towards the political forces of the middle class and House of Commons.  Here the aristocracy would be largely intact, and unburdened by the taxes raised to pay for WWI, taxes which made large inheritances and land ownership prime sources of government funds.  Instead, an intact aristocracy in England--and Europe in general--may have led to a much more Edwardian (as in Edward VII, 1901-1910) atmosphere, perhaps resembling that which followed the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 (indeed, perhaps TR would have inaugurated a second Congress of Vienna!). Instead of giving way to the Jazz Age in England and America, the Lost Generation in Paris and Weimar decadence in Germany, there may have been a more evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, shift in cultural tastes. Perhaps Vienna's cultural dynamism from the 1890's would resurface, making it ""the"" destination for this reality's Hemingways and Fitzgeralds and Gertrude Steins, as, with the grace one finds in a victorious nation, ethnic minorities are accorded the status of provincial governments with representatives in Vienna, leading to a high degree of cultural intermingling.  On the other hand, this victory might ignite the idea of Austria as the dominant cultural, military, and political force of the German-speaking world, if not of Europe as a whole...although economically this would hardly be feasible.  Perhaps it would even entertain a sort of pre-Raphaelite vogue that made medievalism so popular in Victorian England...but who knows?    Existing militaries, rather than giving way to the ideology of Peace in Our Time,  might have been applied towards maintaining colonies--especially the Middle Eastern oil producers in England's case--and an intact Russia, perhaps realizing its industrial capacity was far inferior to the rest of Europe, might have borrowed from its German properties the technology to compete with England in India and Arabia. Would Indian independence forces have flirted with Russia as a bargaining chip to obtain their freedom from English rule? Photographs of Gandhi with Czar Nicholas II? Or perhaps they would have become a commonwealth, a la Canada and Australia, as colonial rule shifted from mining material goods to mining the minds of a hundred million people, each given aptitude testing (multiple choice tests having been widely introduced in the 1910's) and possible free education, in return for a few years spent engineering the next British battlecruiser or French tank.  Perhaps Russian Princes would speak Hindustani, and the House of Lords begrudgingly welcome the first Viscount of Mumbai....  But who knows for sure?"

If the british reinforcements take longer getting to Quatre Bras so Ney can  push through, if the Prussians are caught retreating, if Grouchy can catch up to them earlier, if the Prussians take longer to recover, if Napoleon recalls Grouchy instead of sending him on a goosechase to Wavre, if Napoleon takes seriously the news that the Prussians are on their way, if it doesn't rain before the battle, if the French display more synergy during the battle between infanty, artillery, and cavalry, and lots of other details during the battle had swung the other way Napoleon would have had a decisive victory that day.   The Austrians had something like 60-80,000 men around Alsace on the French border and had some run-ins with French forces notably the battle of Souffel one of the last battles of the Napoleonic Wars, which was a French victory after Waterloo. The Russians had more like 200,000 troops. Napoleon is outnumbered, but everyone is pretty devastated from years of fighting. Experienced troops are in short supply. New equipment and proper horses are scarce as well. Lots of veteran British troops are tangled up fighting Americans. The Austrians have just been fighting in Italy as well. If Napoleon smashed the Brits/Dutch/Prussians at Waterloo and fights a defensive war, he can probably negotiate a peace, which seems to be his intention from the get go of the hundred days anyway. The thing is, that would involve him convincing the great powers to leave him and France alone which certainly seems like something they'd be unwilling to do. Assuming Napoleon still dies a few years later there would probably be another push to restore the Bourbons by the other great powers. Napoleon is pretty quick with reforms though so there's no telling what French society and law would have turned into by then, maybe rendering a restoration moot."

HistoryWhatIf,3bf0no,Leecannon_,3,Sun Jun 28 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"This is freaking awesome!  I've read this completely. Firstly, I loved the naming of the ""Executive Protection Battalion, EPB"". The creativity and awesomeness of that name brought me to read further.  A pacifist presidential general McClellan?! Yes!:D  While I initially considered the Eaton administration to be a decade at least early for progressive politics, I think it's logical on the account that he's governing a south-excluded separate United States in which progressive and liberal policies would prosper. So I concede to this part of the parallel universe. Are African-Americans emancipated in the North in this scenario? If not, a president openly supporting suffrage for women would be political suicide. Emancipation must come before women's suffrage, 19th century feminists and suffrage-advocates knew this. But don't despair! I loved that Susan B. Anthony was tapped to a cabinet position and I thought the North amplifying its application of federalism through the national school system establishment was a very creative logical consequence of a divided America (versus the Confederate states which would've cried for state self-determination and repudiated a national education system if they were still in the union). I appreciated that idea, quite impressive. :)  A Secretary of State turned President never hosting a foreign dignitary? Must've really hated his job as a Sec of State haha  Loved President Selden's story! Instead of getting a patent for an automobile in real history, he emerges a progressive president. This guy is successful no matter what history came his way! I did like his liberal initiatives. An assassinated president is a loved president, in any history. Good job having a progressive president being one from New York, it's the state that produced Theodore Roosevelt and FDR in real time - both progressives.  But there's a small error I recommend fixing. Definitely keep President Selden raising minimum wage, but do keep in mind that what cost $5 in 1900 would cost around $140.05 in 2015. This is all due to inflation. If you were thinking of a minimum wage of $5 in modern terms, that would be around twenty cents in 1900. :)  I appreciated that the president was kidnapped before assassinated. Very original. It's hard coming up with head of state assassinations in alternate history, believe me. Kudos once again.  Great Gatsby goes into gangs - love it. It's brilliant to take a real book and in your alternate history, twisting it to reflect the alternate culture. I sincerely liked this idea.  ""Roaring Thirties"" - heck yeahhhhh!!  President Ernest Hemmingway O.O  I loved the idea of an ""Epic Depression"". Cool renaming. But there's no possible way unemployment could reach 91%. A free market's natural demands of food, utilities, shelter, and basic needs means there will be jobs to acquire these resources and needs. Even given overpopulation (which means demands for basic needs would rise further), the unemployment rate couldn't go higher than 50%. The Great Depression's unemployment rate peaked around 25%, which is still staggering. I'd strongly considering changing the Epic Depression's peak unemployment rate :)  Fascist Sweden is a swede idea. I like the pretext of a couple dragging the US into war on Sweden. If this means Confederate troops fighting along side of American troops, I assume the consequence would be like the French and British fighting alongside like they did in the Crimean War or the Americans and British in the World Wars, in which two former enemies evolve into a special relationship.  You express an impressive amount of creativity and understanding of actual history to make this alternate version.

HistoryWhatIf,3bf0no,Leecannon_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:27:05 2015 UTC,Thoughts on the others?
HistoryWhatIf,3bf0no,Leecannon_,2,Mon Jun 29 00:28:45 2015 UTC,"Sure:)  I don't think Ronald Reagan makes sense as a vice president. He was an actor-turned Governor, a lot of the attention he received in politics was due to how well known he was by the American population. Reagan was a tactical politician who wouldn't take second place, after he lost the Republican nomination for President in 1976 to incumbent Gerald Ford, he spent the next 4 years preparing for a run in 1980.   A presidential nominee for president wouldn't tap an actor as their running mate. People voted for Reagan because he had charisma, they supported their policies, and he was already-well known by the American voter. But if Reagan is a VP and not presidential candidate, (1) his charisma is redundant as he's not going to be the man in charge (2) he's not setting the policies as VP, the prime candidate is (3) VP doesn't have to be well-known or well-liked, people aren't really voting for him. Presidential candidates choose running mates that supplement their perceived weak spots. Obama chose Biden due to his experience, Kennedy chose LBJ for his popularity among Southern Democrats. I have nothing against President Reagan but everything against Vice President Reagan.  I loved the idea of Spiro Agnew being president. He's like Nixon's brother whose not as well at covering up his tracks. However, a President can't ""ban"" a Slav corporation or any other company for that matter. He could, however, ask (or force) Congress to pass a tariff act that applies tariffs onto specific countries (these being Slavic ones of this scenario) that makes these companies' efforts to market in North America unprofitable.  ""a communist radical named Dan Aykroyd"" I love this  ""Orson Scott Card"" be careful with too many allegorical names, you can always create new names!:) There are websites to generate new names  I live in Seattle and I found the Broad St. Massacre to be very entertaining, I could visualize the area in mind reading that.  I like how you had Spielberg as a Vice President just before Lieberman becomes a President. A member of the Jewish faith reaching the VP office allows more comfort room for a Jewish individual acquiring the offices of POTUS. However, if there was no Holocaust, Jewish people are significantly more likely to continue to suffer from persecution on an international level including both sides of the US, thereby making a Jewish politician even in a liberal-half of America less likely.  I love that there's a Female Rights Act of 1990 :) May I suggest this is actually in the form of an Amendment? Like the narrowly failed Equal Rights Amendment that was almost passed in real time USA?  ""a hate-pastor named George Clooney shot at the president's car with a pistol."" This should be a movie pitch to Hollywood. I keep visualizing ""The American"" when I read this line haha.  ""Lieberman changed the abortion law to where a social worker must approve the abortion."" That's an interestingly unique law, keep it in there, but the Supreme Court would surely overturn such a legislation - HOWEVER, the whole dispute on abortion rights in your alternate history can be extremely different (up to you on how) considering that Lincoln was assassinated in 1863 meaning the 14th and 15th Amendments were never passed (or so I assume). These two amendments paved the way for the Due Process Clause, without which a previous conservative president (and more importantly a conservative congress) could've actually outlawed abortion nationwide. That topic could provide some serious word candy.  I noticed Tom Hanks' presidency was three terms due to no 22nd Amendment following FDR in real time history. It's smart that you realized you could do this, another kudos good sir.  With a heavily Christian and Conservative administration under Hanks, an effort to reunite the Confederate States and the Union could be at least attempted. Even if your story says they tried and failed, it still makes it worth the read:)  I really enjoyed Hillary Clinton's alternate backstory. May I recommend for each president you make a section of backstory and a section for tenure?  Your story is splendid and goes deeper than just the surface. Keep adding more!:D"

HistoryWhatIf,3bf0no,Leecannon_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"Our relationship was reunited. Following the World Wars, the United States and United Kingdom have held the closest international relationship since Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling. The US and UK shared nuclear intelligence during WWII, participated in multitudes of joint-operations and wars, and exchanges military and foreign intelligence information on a daily basis. Read this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship , it's highly important when understanding modern geopolitics.  And there's plenty of reasons for the Confederates to reunite with the Union - as well as plenty of reasons not to.  The Confederates and Unions may want to remove tariffs so southern textiles and northern factories can operate business at lower costs - establish free trade at the very least. If the two nations have closed borders, the Great Lakes states would be dreaming of national assimilation so their steamships could cruise out of the Ohio River and Northern Mississippi and into the Gulf of Mexico so they can quit the Erie Canal's cost, traffic, and annoyance. The South was long in need of northern banks, especially in the the reconstruction period of 1865-1877, up until the 1970s when North Carolinan banks were tired of asking New Yorkers for capital whenever they needed money then set up their own banking center in Charlotte, NC through many legal loopholes. (Why do you think so many banks are headquartered in Charlotte? Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc)  It's debatable whether slavery could've existed in the South up to the modern era. The French and British abolished slavery decades before the Americans and I can't see the Confederates being respected on the international stage for long if they incorporate slavery, ESPECIALLY if a United Nations-like international organization is formed. The original League of Nations excluded the USSR because they were Communist, I'm sure any modern Western country would be excluded if they remained a slave-holding state, if not sanctioned for it.   And if slavery is abolished in the CSA, the large African-Americans would incline the South to a more left-wing ideology if not rioting for civil rights and assimilation with the north.  During the US Civil War, the South was blockaded by the North and hence the British Empire (in strong need of cotton imports) set up its own cotton farms in Egypt and India. While its inevitable in any timeline for India and China to cultivate cotton and compete against the American South in this field of market, the Confederacy would need merchants for its exporting of cotton to which the North had plenty. The South needs an industrial base, to which it's not capable alone without the mineral resources. Sure West Virginia has coal, but remember that in real history West Virginia ceded the CSA and joined America, it's not addressed in your timeline but even given a Southern victory in the Civil War (which, if the South won it wouldn't be a Civil War but in fact the Confederate Revolution) the West Virginians and their anti-slavery, anti-war support would referendum into the Union.  In your scenario, missiles are placed in Mexico that threaten both the Confederacy and the Union. Nothing brings two former-enemies closer than a new enemy - just like France and UK against the Russians in the Crimean War, or the Capitalists and Communists against the Fascists in WWII, or so on.  There's lots of reasons for the Confederates and Union to reunite, free trade at the very least. But strong reasons and obstacles do still exist against reuniting. Every political solution has implications, which is what makes alternate history so much fun in my opinion :)"
HistoryWhatIf,3bf0no,MrInexorable,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"One, the realationship you describe between UK and U.S. is what I had in mind. Jefferson Davis invests lots of money to jolt the south, in a positive reconstruction.  I have no intintions for slavery to continue. Northern and western states(Kentucky, Sierra(Cali, San Fran and south), Missouri, Mongollon(Northern Arizona and New Mexico)) is where most of the abolitionists reside. The south does form an alliance with Britain, but pressure from Europe and the Fringe states ends slavery in the early 1900's. I couldn't see it lasting longer. Also (most) of West Virginia remains part of the CSA as part of the peace deal. I sent you one about the state of Marshall read that. I didn't send you everything, and I don't have everything written down. I'm also debating on weither blacks get the vote in 2003, or sooner.

I was simply sharing constructive criticism and elaborating on the UK-US relationship. I really like the idea of a UK-CSA relationship, both countries resented the United States during the latter half of the 19th century and the UK's considerable industrial and commercial base would work perfectly with the CSA's agrarian society. This would also likely ignite a second war between the CSA-UK and the United States or at least escalate tensions (which would prevent both populations wanting to reunite), because the Union would be at a larger disadvantage having the UK's superior navy to rival the Union's. Heck, British intervention into the Civil War might even provide the reason why the CSA won.  This whole timeline could be the result of Charles Francis Adams, Sr, who was Lincoln's foreign minister to Britain, who in real history is largely credited (to a degree) with keeping the British neutral during the American Civil War. In your alternate history, maybe Hannibal Hamlin appoints a replacement for Adams which paths the way for the UK intervening in the US Civil War on the CSA's side, making it the Confederate Revolution.

But on a serious note, Thailand modernizing would suffer more problematic obstacles due to its environment. Extracting ore in a Japanese forest is a lot easier than cutting down a jungle only then to discover where resources can be located. While both countries historically have negligible mineral resources,  this scenario of modernizing Thailand would mean the Thai must acquire Iron ore, coke, copper, bauxite and most importantly coal (eventually oil as well) elsewhere, meaning Thailand would emerge into an imperialistic empire just like that of fascist Japan.  When Japan modernized in the late 19th century, it wasn't just through economics and culture but also its political philosophy evolved like that of the imperialistic Europeans.

HistoryWhatIf,3bfbbj,spotapp,5,Sun Jun 28 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"Depends. The significance of the battle mostly came from destroying the majority of the Japanese carrier fleet. Physically occupying Midway would be a blow to the air force, since they'd have one fewer base, but the exact losses the US and Japanese fleets take change the tactical situation in the Pacific significantly.   Even in the worst case scenario, the Japanese already lost the Battle of the Coral Sea, and are starting to stretch their ground forces thinly. Assuming Roosevelt sticks to the Europe-first strategy, Midway will be just one more island for the marines to take. Remember that the Doolittle raid, the first U.S. bombing of Tokyo, was launched from aircraft carriers, not a land base, and by the time the Atomic bombs were ready to deploy, the U.S. also had the B-52 Superfortress (actually it was the B-29), capable of long range bombardment. So unless the Japanese are able to totally wipe out the American aircraft carrier fleet (it would have to be almost a complete reversal of OTL), the war will still progress much the same way."

They would be able to launch bombing raids of Hawaii and put the US on the defensive for longer in the Pacific. I doubt an invasion of Hawaii would meet with much success. They'd be slowly crawling from one island to another and fighting a well entrenched enemy. It took the Japanese over three months to take the Philippines and that was with the element of surprise. This would cause the US to switch from their ""Germany first"" strategy and focus most of their efforts on Japan. By the time the Japanese close in on Honolulu, the US would have built and outfitted a new fleet with transports full of troops ready to depart from California.   The end result would be the US sending the bulk of their forces to the Pacific rather than Europe. The British would eventually drive the Germans and Italians out of North Africa but there's no D-Day so the Russians would take Berlin by the end of 1946. The US retakes the the Philippines by 1943 and begins a strategy of encirclement to prevent any supplies from reaching Japan. This might mean an invasion of China is in order the the Americans would link up with Chang Kai-shek's army.

HistoryWhatIf,3bgtno,HaydenHank,7,Mon Jun 29 02:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well, in the War of 1812 the British were reluctant to deploy significant amounts of troops to North America due to Napoleon's continental blockade of the UK and the British's concern of an invasion. So already in real time history were the British withholding their full force onto the young American republic due to their conflict with Napoleon. The US made a couple of invasion attempts into Canada during the War of 1812 which obviously failed, but in an alternate history could've won.  The only difference in this WhatIf is that the US would be officially allied with Napoleon instead of simply fighting the mutual enemy Britain. Even if the US joined in earlier than 1812, the previous administration under Thomas Jefferson's solution to America's navy with such a small federal budget was funds for nothing more than a coastal defense comprised of gunboats concentrated for harbor and river defenses while Britain's naval dominance of the time was unquestionable.  I don't think there would be a difference."

They do fight any American troops actually on British soil and beef up the defenses of Canada but don't even initiate a blockade of the East Coast. They play the victim up well in the American press. Hayes resigns. Wheeler takes office for a few months and immediately starts negotiations.   The war greatly influences the 1880 election which was close anyway and tips it in favor of Hancock the Democrat who adds a stop the war plank to the platform. The two platforms were not much different so little else changes. Hancock wins a second term and dies in office in 1886 allowing English to be President. This means Cleveland does not get elected in 1884 his first term starts in 1888 and Harrison is never President. A Democratic streak of Presidents rivals the previous Republican one with Democrats being in office from 1880-1896.

Between 100,000 and 300,000 people came out to prevent the Fascist's march, and many of them occupied the buildings along the march path, giving them high ground from which to pelt the march. The anti-Fascists had no problem attacking and holding policemen prisoner, I don't see why they would treat the Fascists any different. I doubt anyone would be killed on purpose, so Mosley would probably be roughed up but alive.   From a political standpoint it would have been suicide. The Fascist party was already rapidly losing support from the press and upper classes due to earlier violent incidents. This would be the final nail in the coffin for Mosley and his men.   A full scale battle would have probably seen them imprisoned and given hard labor sentences for at least a year, and they would likely not be released until after the war. After the war Mosley is as unpopular as ever. The government still requires police authorization for future demonstrations after the battle, and bans uniforms for political organizations, both of which severely curtail Fascist party efforts along side growing resentment towards continental Fascists like Mussolini and Hitler."

I imagine seeing the spread of humanity go about the same. A major difference (assuming no butterfly effect) is that the Roman Empire has a much easier time holding on to at least parts of Britannia, leaving the peninsula far more Romanized. When Rome inevitable fades, the area of the Thames-Rhine river becomes a powerful area, due to the rich farmland, and being at a crossroads between germanic and Frankish tribes.   The areas downriver, underneath OTL England will also be fairly sheltered from regular Viking raids, as the Norsemen have to sail all the way around the British Peninsula or port across all the rivers to make it across, which would be extraordinarily difficult to do. As the lands grow stronger, they create a strong Kingdom centered around the joining of the Thames and Rhine,spreading from there to the coast and to the ends of the river, creating a strong trading empire, based on commerce and agriculture. If they can utilize the river and the Brittany-Cornish inlet with small shallow bottom boats, they could even spread their influence up the Seine and into Cornwall.   These would likely be a Germanic group, so, for them it might feel natural to continue north up the British Peninsula where there are other Germanic groups (much like OTL Anglo-Saxons). While Scotland may not be as easy nut to crack, direct and indirect control of England, the Southern and Mid- Doggerbank, much of the Low countries, and influence as far as out modern Paris will leave the Doggs in position to heavily influence the future of European civilization."

Once Prez, 9/11 happens as IOTL. McCain is able to form a more international coalition against the Taliban as he doesnt try to go around convincing people to side with America by quoting Revelations to the French President. Bc McCain is more concerned about Pakistani support of the Taliban instead of Saddam, attention is not diverted away from Afghanistan to Iraq, resulting in the capture or death of bin Laden in Tora Bora in late 2001, early 2002. Relations with Pakistan remain somewhat strained as McCain  was not overly concerned with US troops spilling over the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in pursuit of Taliban fighters. After the death/capture of bin Laden McCain puts far more emphasis on creating a strong Afghani central government allied to America, instead of trying to convince the various Afghani tribes about the magic of democracy. Large garrisons are left behind in Afghanistan to support this new central government and oppose the revival of the Taliban and the meddling of the Pakistani ISI.   Despite his wartime success, bc McCain uses the 2001 budget surplus and a combination of tax increases to pay for the war, instead of charging it to a credit card like Bush, his popularity domestically begins to plummet late in his first term.

Maybe the Reich aims for closer ties with the UK to have a potent ally against a Franco-Russian pact.  As for the July Crisis, this might not even happen in this timeline. Sarajevo happened more or less on Austria's home turf, I doubt the Germans would send a really important person that far from home into a already heated atmosphere of nationalism.  The real lynchpin the the Balkans would be Hungary in any way. Bordered by both Germany and Russia (assuming Galicia goes to Poland and thus Russia), it is large but devoid of large ressource deposits (really, really arable land, though). Over time it will be forces to align with one of it's big neighbours. As the by far largest state in Southeastern Europe, Hungary itself may then become active in the Balkans.

Ok, let's take Berlin as the flashpoint, in June 1948. The USSR closes the road and rail routes in to the enclave. The Berlin Airlift kicks off as OTL. As per OTL, there are narrow air corridors which must be used, and the boundaries are enforced by Russian fighter aircraft. A Dakota / DC-3 makes a navigation error - or perhaps it's the Russian radar operator. It's shot down. NATO does not exist at this stage (it dates from April 1949), but the Treaty of Brussels had been signed three months before, involving Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. OTL, this and the Berlin Blockade let to the European Defence Organisation in September 1948.  The USA went through a short period of isolationism immediately after WW II. This roughly corresponded with the period of the Morgenthau Plan, which was replaced by the more famous Marshall Plan in April 1948. My point is that the USA was not firmly committed to Europe, and also distrusted the far-left Labour government which had been installed in the UK. So let's suppose that the USA either did not abandon isolationism by June 1948, or was not sufficiently committed to Europe to react to the shooting down of the Dakota. This takes American nuclear weapons off the table, and at the time they had not been developed by Russian (1949), the UK (1952) or France (1960).   Britain on its own could possibly have run the air-lift with great difficulty, but not under Russian attack. The other countries of the EDO cannot contribute substantial military resources. The UK now has to consider whether to put in an armed escort for all transports (knowing that the escorts will not be adequate, and that this will exhaust the limited military resource); or to send in the transports unescorted; or to abandon the airlift. There is an interruption in the lift for a couple of hours while this is discussed and a protest is registered with the USSR. The Russians decide to take advantage of the indecision by closing the air corridors as they have the land routes.  I think this would cause the immediate cession of West Berlin by the UK, France and the USA."

The only viable target for the Americans would be Soviet military - but with a small number of atomic bombs, the impact would not be as massive as it would be later in the Cold war. And if we're talking about the early fifties, the Soviets have their own atomic weaponry.  Now, about the event that starts the war. There are a few hot spots where a conflict between the powers could lead to war: Berlin, Vienna and Trieste. With the latter, the war could start as early as 1945 and it might make things harder for everybody since the war in the Pacific was not yet over when Britain and Yugoslavia came in conflict over it. Another reason for war could be the conflict between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, with the Allies siding with the former.  I have to say that OP found the perfect period of the Cold war for an armed conflict between the blocks to be possible. Firstly, both sides were still only partially informed on the effects of nuclear weapons, so there is a much higher chance that they are actually used in war.

With what funds, I dunno.  Let's say Louis XIV took it on as a pet project and subsequent monarchs kept it up.  There's only so much coastal space there, so sheer population pressure starts pushing French colonists into nearby Spanish Florida and Texas.  Eventually they become French territories, let's say as treaty terms from the War of the Quadruple Alliance or some such, since they have by that point become that in all but name anyway.  So this Louisiana is all about the river.  The major investments paid off, and massive quantities of goods from the land flow downstream to port, thence to France, greatly enriching the mother country.  As a result, the Ancien regime has none of the money problems that eventually led to its downfall.  In particular is an early opening of the Great Plains as the bread basket of the French Empire.  Not sure how the Seven Years war would be altered.  The British still have an easier time getting men and supplies into the area, but French colonists and their native allies (do they still have them?) are simply too numerous to be steamrolled.  Let's say that it goes massively in their favor, and British colonies are restricted from any further western expansion, eventually falling into the French sphere of influence.  But that works both ways, because now the French colonists have all these liberty-minded statesmen to converse with.  However, perceptions of both colonies being treated by their home governments as nothing more than resource depots (and not major population and industrial centers that combined would make a respectable nation by European standards) contribute to increasingly acrimonious relationships.  Eventually things come to a head, and both sets of colonies jointly declare independence from their home nations and ally to defend the claim.  This works massively in their favor, since London and Paris absolutely refuse to coordinate with each other in the slightest, so the colonies are able to effectively double the force they bring to bear with each of them.  The French government, being more dependent on its colonies than the British, try to fight on a bit longer, but it's ultimately a lost cause and they too throw in the towel.  Cue massive economic hardships for them, culminating in a popular revolt.  Meanwhile, the American founding fathers and pères fondateurs, impressed at how well their alliance functioned, vote to weld the colonies together into a single state.  Much debate goes into its constitutional convention, but eventually a compromise is reached where the capital is placed in New Orleans in exchange for some legal matters the eastern states wanted.  Officially bilingual, with a population of nearly 10 million, stretching from the Caribbean to Hudson Bay.

Most of that debt came from fighting Mexico for independence.  Louisiana had a better economy than Texas and the larger established population with few Americans would not want annexation. That larger establish population also means that Americans would be more likely to assimilate as the result of marrying into local families.  The big question is how would Louisiana avoid being sold by Napoleon? He needed the money to finance his plans and the territory was not that rich that it could have bought its own freedom.  How do you manage that?

Barbarossa ends in a bitter peace with Germany occupying everything west of the Urals. Britain holds on desperately as the sole democratic state left in Europe with its sovereign future uncertain.  American domestic changes: Hardcore isolationism keeps the USA out of the war. No embargo against Japan. America's industry plods along, waves of refugees and immigrants escaping Europe find themselves deadlocked on Ellis island due to a new, more strict quota system in place. Long becomes the first Roman Catholic President, rather than JFK.  Long focuses on improving education, voting availability, social programs and infrastructure in the country. A proto-interstate system is built 20 years earlier than our time. Elections period is no longer the first Tuesday of November, but is now a 2-day, 2-night long period on Friday and Saturday.  The entrenched political elite in Washington are vocally upset at Long's populist policies and seek to remove him from the White House, but with voter numbers and political consciousness improving by the month, Long manages to maintain his grip on the executive office by sheer force of charisma and national backing.  International changes: Germany becomes a European continental hegemon. The Holocaust is intensified, with European Jews, Serbs and other targets virtually wiped out by the end of the 1940s. However, intense partisan activity in occupied Russia, Lithuania and Poland puts immense stress on the German war machine, which is suffering from overextension and economic malaise at home. With the total war economy still in high gear but no world war left to fight, Germany struggles to provide consumer goods or even basic necessities to their newly conquered population. At first bread lines form across the cities, then massive population exoduses intermingled with riots or outright rebellions begin to pepper the Third Reich. The death of Hitler in the early 1950s sends the Third Reich into further despair. With parts of the empire either falling out of Berlin's periphery or revolting altogether, the Soviet Union takes the opportunity to invade with a reinvigorated Red Army, backed by a salvaged industry in Siberia.

Napoleon chose not to march on Russia, instead being content with controlling large swathes of Western and Central Europe and gradually integrating them into the French fold. Napoleon's successors marry into the Swedish and Portuguese royal houses and establish a federalized empire that stretches from Portugal to Sweden, while also federalizing French colonies in the Caribbean and Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America into the Federation of France. With such a vast empire, it is likely (even in shrunken form) to dominate Europe and the Americas.   In 2015, the French Empire has turned into the European Confederation, which controls all of continental Western and Central Europe and is nominally francophone, although Spanish, Portuguese, German/Dutch, Italian, Polish, and Scandinavian (Napoleon's successors work to fuse closely related languages) are co-official.

It's understandable that a leader in his position would believe, especially in the 1800's, that the only path to peace is by conquering his enemies.   Still, you're right. Even though the nepotism is frowned upon today many of Napoleon's appointed regional rulers performed admirably and displayed remarkable affection for their new subjects.

After pressure being applied on by both the protesters and the Republic of China's allies, the President decided to allow more political freedoms, economic freedoms, and announced elections in the following years, in 1990. Thanks to the new policies, China experienced growth unseen even in the previous decades, and led to the very close elections in 1996 in which the Kuomintang won by a very faint majority against the Democratic Progressive Party, and therefore received more support with the hand over of Hong Kong and Macao back to the Republic of China.     Today, China is a free democracy, although it still has its fair share of problems. Tibetans and Uyghurs, although flourishing under the Republic, have their fair share of complaints, and their demands include more autonomy and even independence. It is the same in Inner Mongolia, except that there are calls for reunification with Mongolia proper. Besides that, China also experiences problems with corruption - especially in the richer cities like Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao. Despite these problems, life under the Republic of China is great, although diplomatic relations with its nearby neighbours have been strained at the very worse - although there is still heavy trading between them. Japanese, Koreans, Indians, Vietnamese, and others have their fair share of problems with China, but still trade with them regardless."

The range was much greater, but the weapons used were modern in most respects. In that one, Vulcans were used to suppress enemy radar - harder for a continental invasion as there would be many more  sites, but the reduced range would mean that it was easier to reach them.  In the Falklands air superiority was achieved, but not air supremacy. This might be realistic for Overlord. Although the Axis would have modern jets, there would still be a fuel limitation due to the blockade. Jets are less fussy on fuel than piston engines, so fuel could be derived from coal - nevertheless quantity would be a limitation. They would probably make more use of ground to air missiles in compensation, so Allied air crew would suffer heavy losses.  The actual invasion would have to be played out on the ground. There is no way to parachute in or transport by air such large numbers of troops. This means that devices like the Mulberry Harbours and PLUTO would still be used. There would be much greater use of air to ground weaponry. I assume that although modern weaponry is used, we are not talking about modern budgetary constraints, so the UK would field a large force of Harriers and Jaguars (retired from the current inventory, but more effective bulk mud-movers than the Typhoon and Tornado).  One class of weapon doesn't seem to get much attention these days - the conventional SRBM and IRBM and the conventionally armed cruise missile. Given that Germany would probably maintain air superiority further back from the front, these would probably be used to disrupt logistics, attacking the transport network and communications centres. I'd expect a preference for ballistic missiles despite their reduced accuracy - cruise missiles would be a bit too vulnerable to interception."

Even though this happens after the McCarthy era, the US would never tolerate a communist insurgency on its own soil. If the government finds out about the communists' links to Cuba, then I would expect a war between Cuba and the US to break out. The US was trying to build support for an invasion of Cuba for a while during this period, even going as far as to start false-flag operations (see Operation Northwoods).  The agreements made after the Cuban Missile Crisis pledging not to invade Cuba would probably be revoked since an invasion was not explicitly forbidden if Cuba committed a direct provocation, which is what the funding of communist insurgents in the US would likely fall under. If the Soviets decide to aid Cuba against the US, then this could easily turn into another proxy war like the Korean and Vietnam Wars.  I can't really say how this will affect public perception of the Vietnam War though. As far as I know, it wasn't really treated with negativity until the 70s."

In OTL there was a non-negligible level of antiwar and generally rebellious sentiment within the armed forces by the late 60s and early 70s. Sympathy for the ""enemy"" would have been much higher in this scenario, given stronger cultural and especially linguistic ties.  As for the US public, I doubt it would be monolithic. While mainstream anti-Communism would probably increase, a significant chunk of the Black and Latino populations would presumably identify with the Puerto Rican rebels, and by association with the Viet Cong.

I might be mixing the time of events up here but here's kinda how it went:  The mongols wanted Japan because mongol so they launched a huge fleet and hired a shitton of korean soldiers and siege experts, mongols had a very clever habit of using the skills of the people they conquered you see. So the japanese built palisades and fortifications along the coast where the mongols where heading so when they attacked they couldn't get past the beach. The mongols returned butthurt to their boats to regroup. While they were on the boats of the coast a typhoon rolled in and sunk the majority of the ships so the mongols hade to give up.   A few years later the mongols tried again and once again a typhoon sunk their ships. Then they gave up and Japan was never conquered by the mongols.   Now what a mongol rule of Japan might have meant is pure speculation but it is safe to say that the Sengoku period of constant warfare between all the different clans wouldn't play out, thus Japan wouldn't be united under Tokugawa who led a strong isolationist policy. With european powers having an easier time getting into Japan maybe they become colonized and Japan would today be a developing country.  Or they could industrialize earlier and their imperialist expansion (if it happens) is more accepted by western powers since they are one of the world powers and not something that needs to be ""dealt with"" in WW2 as one of the axis of evil. But I don't know enough about imperial Japan to speculate how that would play out.

You can not like it, you can argue about the perpetual state of the Union, but the specific act of succession itself is not treason. If it is then every independence movement on the earth is in trouble and we have a bunch of Scots that need trials. No they could not leave, but at the same time attempting to is something else not treason.  If the southern states had taken it the courts (taken what exactly?

The court would rule against them, they would not agree with that ruling and attempt to leave at a later date then a war would start.

HistoryWhatIf,3azgve,OtakuMecha,2,Thu Jun 25 01:41:46 2015 UTC,"firing on Ft Sumter might meet the definition of Treason   No it doesn't. S.C. announced succession December 20, 1860.  The first shots were fired on January 9, 1861. As far as S.C. was concerned it was firing on a hostile foreign power occupying its land. That's not treason. Even if you reject succession firing on the military in the fort was not an act to attempt to overthrow the government of the U.S. it was an act of rebellion which is a different crime.   The Southern States thru whatever mechanism that legally expresses the will of their Voting Citizens/People and Legislatures give notice of session to the President/ Congress   They did. Every state either had a constitutional convention or its legislature met and voted on succession. There were some issue in the border states but we can just ignore them for now.  As each of the Articles of Succession passed the southern states no longer recognize the Supreme Court as having jurisdiction over them so Lincoln's lawyers (in a very modern act not an 1860s one) can file and the Supreme Court an issue whatever injunctions they want. Courts don't actual have powers to enforce the law that is up to the executive branch. So we are right back at the war if the South refuses to follow the injunction.  Lets pretend the South wasn't filled with hothead secessionist hell bent on leaving a country they felt was out to destroy their livelihood (because thats what the end of slavery means, a massive taking of property and the destruction of the economic system and power of the people in charge ion the south). Instead pass requests to leave the Union citing specific grievances. The Supreme Courts knows that as soon as a democracy accepts its members leaving the democracy as a solution to conflicts the democracy crumbles. Every problem becomes a reason for the minority to leave. Democracy can only function when the minority accepts that the majority will protect its rights, and continue to participate in the democracy. The South no longer felt the North was going to protect its rights. The Court can either vote for the dissolution of the U.S. and I don't mean the South leaving but other regions in short order too, or they can vote for the perpetual Union.   Now why exactly do you believe the Southern States lose that argument before the Supreme Ct   The Supreme Court has one and only one member resign as a result of the Civil War. John Archibald Campbell from AL. We can take that to say which way the Justices, even the ones from border and southern states (GA, TN, MD) vote. Even Justice Wayne from GA stays with the Union during the war despite the fact his son took a position with the South. Except for Campbell the 7 remaining (one seat was vacant till 1862) Justices will vote for the Union.  A vote which most likely takes place after McLean dies Apr 4 1861, but he is going to be replaced by a northern Republican appointed by Lincoln anyway. The majority of the 8 are going to vote for the Union.  Worst case all 4 southern and border Justices vote for succession, 4 northern ones vote for union and everything is in limbo until Lincoln appoints another Northern Republican justice.  The South is not going to accept that verdict and things proceed as IRL except 6 months later.  The South was already aware of how the court leaned and how any vote would turn out. Why bother with the legal proceedings when you are already convinced they are stacked against you? And that was how the South felt."

However, the Spanish would be unable to take Gibraltar as is, so the Luftwaffe is likely called in to turn the rock in to rubble. The North African campaign turns out a lot differently as the air space over the Straight of Gibraltar becomes highly contested.  Turkey: Given the time that Turkey enters the war, it might be able to participate in the invasion of Greece from the east. Ending this invasion early would give Germany more time to fight against the Soviet Union in the spring. Also, Turkey would be able to free up some German divisions while extending the Soviet front line south. This could have a huge impact on the war.  Iraq and Iran: By turning these two countries belligerent, Lend Lease aid to the Soviets needs to find a new path to get to them, as the British and the Soviets would be unable to commit the required manpower to opening up Iran. This could cause the United States to use the North Pacific to send Lend Lease aid through Siberia, which would be much closer to the Japanese Home Islands. Japan might respond by invading the Soviet Union in late 1941 to close these resupply bases instead of bombing Pearl Harbor.

That's not to say they didn't have disease and plagues, syphilis has certainly been attributed to Native Americans and when it reached Europe it caused one hell of an epidemic. Still, you can't really compare the birthplace of humanity (Africa) to the virgin New World in terms of disease. In one place Humans have been living there for millions of years, in the other a few thousand. The only diseases New World Natives could have had are the ones they brought with them (and didn't kill all their hosts). Since large, cramped, poorly sanitized populations (preferably with plenty of opportunities for transfer between humans and animals such as open-air markets, farming and livestock, hunting) are what breed virulent diseases I would expect our mythical panamerican civilization to have cities analogous to European ones but they just don't have the time or the environment for nature to take advantage of them. Our explorers fresh off the boat are going to be dropping like flies from endemic Old World diseases like measles and tuberculosis. The best case scenario is the sailors make it back home alive but infected and a wave of plagues travels through the Americas until the population reaches a level that can no longer support such virulent strains and the diseases calm down and become endemic and the survivors miraculously manage to rebuild their civilization and acquire relative immunity in childhood and are less devastated during future cross-Atlantic contact."

Anyways, lets say the Inca/Aztec equivalents (I'll abbreviate them I/AE from here on out) land in Spain in AD 117 after creating a huge empire in Mesoamerica, stretching from Panama to the Southwest USA, with a pretty big interest in maritime technology. It would be tough to judge technology of this hypothetical Mesoamerican civilization without fleshing out a huge timeline, but with the horse equivalents in this timeline, maybe they are a little behind Rome as far as land combat goes, but a little ahead as far as naval combat.   I would say that they land, maybe fight the Romans a bit, but couldn't necessarily make any big gains other than MAYBE speed up the fall of Rome.   I think you can butterfly out Islam, and Christianity may or may not be picked up by a roman empire like Constantine.

Fairly sure most would agree that things like quipus were fairly sophisticated efficient and effective communication devices.   For wheels, I would argue that's a function of geography.

More often than not the ruler of a city-state was left in place to continue to govern as they did before with the except that they now had to pay tribute to the Mexica tlatoanime. If a city-state rebelled the Mexica sent troops to reconquer them. Repeat rebellions resulted in a replacement of the former ruler with someone the Mexica chose. Their territory was in a constant state of secured allies and disgruntled subjects. If enough people were disgruntled the Mexica would not have the resources to quell the unrest and would most likely lose power.  So you're correct that the Mexica may not have lasted for very long, but you're wrong about why that would be."

In any realistic scenario I think contact might be pushed back a few decades to 100 years at most, which does have some interesting implications.  Perhaps the Spanish wind up wasting a bunch of time and resources scouring Florida instead of focusing on Central America, the Aztecs and other Mesoamericans would likely have heard rumors or gathered significant intelligence about an alien people from the east and have been better prepared for later contact.  Or maybe Cortes' machiavellian charms fall on deaf ears with Aztec enemies and his party gets wiped out before ever meeting Moctezuma.  Possibly as a result the French greet the Aztec king first, how would that change the timeline?  In any case, it's hard to overestimate and avoid the impact of Old World diseases whenever it came. The Aztecs would have no defense to that, and it would have been a crippling blow to them."

Plus without the conflicts in South America and Europe sending so many immigrants to the West Indes the populations might have stayed smaller for longer allowing a different region of the globe to develop the infrastructure necessary for mechanization.   I'm tempted to say Indonesia or maybe Japan but I don't think industrialization is necessarily limited to archipelagos. Australia just wasn't settled early enough.  I guess if the Russians don't lose to the Scandinavians (in my timeline I assume they don't fight them at all) and instead put all their efforts into taking the Black Sea and push back the Ottomans then they could probably manage it with the resources and manpower they had.

As has been mentioned in some others comments, there's not much benefit in trench warfare. But what about in the air?  Again, it's doubtful that they would be much of a benefit. Why? The early aircraft of WWI had limited range. Therefore mission times must have been fairly short. Compare this with WWII where bombers and long range fighters were capable of missions lasting many hours.  In WWI, a strong cup of coffee (and the adrenaline of combat) would have been sufficient for plenty of alertness for the shorter missions they had back then.

Obviously both attempts failed, particularly the second attempt with the US threatening to intervene if the Soviets didn't pull out.  Hence the Soviet funding and support of the Tudeh party, a major catalyst in Iran up to 1953.  Most people today try to downplay the role of the Tudeh party and the Soviet involvement in Iran up to 1953 as a way to solely blame Iran's problems on just the CIA and MI6 and make it a pretty package to sell people, but it's much more complicated than that.  So then, what would have happened if the Soviets are allowed to occupy the whole country and install a puppet government?  Well likely the British (since the Abadan oil refinery was the biggest in the world and was under British control at the time), as well as the US (Truman did threaten to use force to kick the Soviets out of Northern Iran) would have gotten involved to push the Soviets back.    Due to various interests there would have likely been a war, covert or all out is unclear, between the two sides, since while Eastern Europe was more or less agreed by the Allies to remain under Soviet control Iran was not on the table."

Any permanent alliance with Poland would A) have been a betrayal of Hitler's promises to the German people and the party (living space in the east) and B) would have required at minimum the return of traditional German lands, especially west Prussia, which the Poles were totally unwilling to countenance.

It might have averted conflict temporarily but I think the south saw the writing on the wall. The country was moving away from slavery so it was now or never for them. Slavery only lasted as long as it did because of the careful balance of the number of slave and free states which meant the senate was disproportionately stacked in favor of the less populous south. With only free states coming into the union, ""slave power"" would slowly diminish.

Industrialists would rival planters for economic and social dominance which would create a niche for the industrial abolition movement. More southern industrialists would lead to more southern factory workers.   They would have a common enemy in slave labor meaning they would be much more open to Marxist ideas, adopting class consciousness to race consciousness.   this would lead to pushes to abolish slavery to protect the white man's jobs.   Slavery would slowly be abolished, state by state through the early 1910s and southern urbanization would lag behind northern urbanization by about two decades.   with this urbanization the south and north will share in the urban racial/ethnic strife.

They weren't anywhere close to the North yet, but they were growing at a faster actual rate. You'd think this reduction in the dominance of plantation agriculture would be a good thing, right? Sadly, no. Slavery went hand in hand with these new enterprises. 10,000 slaves were owned by Southern railroads in 1860. Thousands more worked in tobacco factories and textile mills, in hotels and train stations and restaurants, doing the low-skill labor that freedmen and poor whites would do after the war. Imagine that: an alternate future in which all the menial jobs - the janitors, the fry cooks, the prostitutes, the waiters, hotel porters, laborers, et al - are performed by enslaved people.  Slavery had gone beyond agriculture; had gone beyond economics, even. It had become part of the fabric of southern culture and society. To lose slavery was to lose the white dominance of society; and that meant the South was as good as lost, or so many leading Southerners thought. Think of the Civil War as an intervention on a heroin addict writ large; the South was forced to give up an institution that they showed literally no sign - none, there was virtually no domestic opposition to the institution in 1860 - of parting with."

Several states were on the fence about seceding from the Union prior to the Battle of Ft. Sumter. Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee had rejected offers from the Confederacy many times for a variety of reasons. The populations were fairly evenly split on the issue of slavery and they usually had economies that relied on the north. Without the Federal government raising troops to fight against states in rebellion,  then they might not have seceded at all.  The remaining states in the Confederacy will be unlikely to act aggressively. They have no reason to, the US Civil War is a defensive action. That said, the Union and the Confederacy are at loggerheads. Lincoln refuses to accept compensation for Federal forts in the so-called Confederacy, and Confederate troops will refuse to allow them to be supplied. If the first battle does not take place on South Carolina, it would have likely happened in Florida.   In either case, the remaining states secede at the thought of the Federal government sending the military to attack a state. The Civil War happens roughly the same, though perhaps the conflict is delayed a few days or weeks.   If the Federal government accepts the Confederacy's offers of compensation then they are basically validating the Confederacy's right to exist. European powers will quickly recognize it and the whole affair will be avoided. This is probably bad news for the Confederate states, as Egyptian cotton will still likely come about depressing prices of cotton in the 1870s or 1880s instead of the 1860s.

It more so comes down to that a lot of the border and late joining states in the Confederacy were split on the issue of slavery. The populations were not really for emancipation, but they did not support slavery enough to justify secession. Many of the states secession votes came down to the line, and that was with a lot of meddling and interference by pro-secessionists. The percieved federal attack on states pushed many people over the edge due to the issue of state sovereignty.   Northern Virginia (now West), parts of Tennessee, Arkansas, and so on, didn't really have slaves, and they didn't care enough about the issue of slavery to secede from the union based on that issue alone. I'm in Germany for a few weeks and don't have my copy with me to provide more details, but the book is definitely worth a read."

Yet any launches would could involve US/NATO launching retaliatory strikes against a seeming Soviet or Sino first strike. End result annihilation of life on earth.  However a localised theatre war presents problems for both forces. China has effectively unlimited manpower to conscript so in theory a Chinese army could simply overwhelm Soviet forces. The logistics to do so we're not something 1969 China could achieve. The Cultural Revolution was in full swing, and even if it weren't China's industrial and agricultural base would have been stretched to breaking point supporting this hypothetical massive army. Similarly campaigning in Siberia outside of the prime summer months would be dangerous to any force involved, not least one struggling with logistics. Finally China is resource poor compared to the USSR, so if the campaign is protracted the resource stockpiles may be depleted.  On the Soviet side, Siberia is not the centre of industry and population so there are logistics issues here too. The mechanized army that the Soviets would deploy would need vast amounts of food, oil, spares etc so it would be challenging to the Soviet industrial complex to provide.  Logistics aside, in terms of equipment the Soviets have the Chinese licked, and alot of the Chinese arms at this stage would be knockoff copies of older Soviet equipment. So here the Soviets have a qualitative advantage.  Historically the Soviets defeated the Japanese at Khalkin Gol and Nomohan (on mobile cannot check this spelling) in 1937/38, and later demolished the depleted Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria in 1945. Despite being against the Japanese, and not the PLA, the Soviet army has a good track record in conflicts in Manchuria, so extrapolating to the 1969 Border Conflict they have the advantage here too.  Finally, the USSR can call on the Warsaw Pact, freeing up troops deployed in Eastern Europe to combat the PRC. China is locally isolated. Here the Soviets have an edge.  So here goes....  Soviet and Chinese forces repeatedly clash in 1969. Attempts to deescalate the conflict fail, and in an  attempt to maintain control and divert the attentions of the people during the Cultural Revolution, the PLA moves forces to seize control of the wider areas beyond the Ussuri river in April 1969. The advance is initially successful, but when the Red Army redeploys elite units from the central European theater the tide turns. The PLA is pushed back to the border quickly, and the Soviet Air Force decimates the region. Fearing a full on Soviet invasion, the PRC begins negotiations."

Answer:  Never.     This is a reference to China's enormous population.  Presumably the birth rate in China is large enough to indefinitely supply soldiers for their army.  If the conflict broke out into all-out war, the Soviet Union might make some quick gains, but in the long run, I think that China would win.  The Chinese context is that they were already short-changed on territory by history - so this would be a good time to re-conquer some lands.  Domestically a war against an enemy also helps solidify political power, so the Chinese would likely end up taking huge swaths of land."

Early humans almost didn't make it if genetic studies are to be believed so in this alternate history I propose that pre-human hominids along the lines of the dead end Homo Erectus or preferably a stray Heidelbergensis population or one of those poorly understood middle-eastern species migrate all the way to Australia like humans eventually did (even Home Erectus seems to have made it all the way to Indonesia if Floresiensis is a descendant of Erectus) and then climate change wipes out African people like it almost did in OTL. Afterwards the hominids in Australia evolve more or less into anatomically and neurologically modern Homo Sapiens.   The interior of Australia is pretty foreboding so it's likely that Humans didn't stray too far from the coast or at least enough of them stayed around to spread back to New Guinea and Island hop their way to the Asian mainland.   Homo Erectus and other stragglers go extinct in China. Paleoanthropologists will argue back and forth whether or not Homo Sapiens were responsible for their extinction.   Meanwhile in Europe lack of competition with modern humans has permitted Neanderthal man to survive the last ice age. The Neanderthal population has been steadily increasing throughout Eurasia allowing the trade networks absent from OTL to foster a proper proto civilization.   In Australia humans have been spreading species introduced from southeast Asia. Most notably, guineafowl. I'm not sure how quick diprotodons and Thylacines breed but I can't think of a proper biological reason why marsupials can't be domesticated.   Neanderthals domesticate dogs. They look almost exactly like wolves. If anything selective breeding by Neanderthals has made them slightly larger.   Neanderthals and Sapiens interact in India for the first time. Africa is still devoid of humans. Humans have brought with them Chicken and Pigs, Neanderthals dogs and goats. As both are new to India the two species are able to interact peacefully. Fine gifts are exchanged such as Megalenia skins and Mammoth tusks.   Human sailors blown off course discover New Zealand and form isolated populations. Sheep are introduced to Australia. Kangaroo are bred in captivity.   Humans and Neanderthals working together domesticate horses and cattle.   The same sort of general rules for geographical domestication being species-specific apply to plants as well. I know I've unfairly accelerated a lot of timelines here and I don't really have an answer for that except that I'm playing off memory. Citrus from southwest Asia, grains from the near-east. I don't expect humans exploring too far North being primarily warm weather adapted and the inverse of course applies to Neanderthals. Eventually Africa is recolonized.im trying to think of a way to save Mesopotamia from desertification via irrigation but that might be too utopia. Eventually folks from New Zealand will make their way to the Pacific at large and will probably be the first to the Americas since my humans can't really tolerate colder weather.

There was a huge positive-feedback between brain complexity and biological success.  So you have to have a fairly social kind of animal.  Koalas as we know them today eat low-nutritional-value eucalyptus. Their diet does not give them much excess energy, and they can't be very active.

Southeast Asia and China probably fill the void. Less resistance to conversion to other religions if Hinduism weakens for any reason. Buddhism could easily become a majority religion, as could Christianity. Less religious pressure might allow the Majapahit empire to last longer and not necessarily collapse. The islands would still be likely to fall to foreign colonization; I don't think replacing the religion would be enough to prevent a large pan-Indonesian nationalist movement after a while.

GWB probably never becomes president, nor does neoconservativism become a dominant ideology.  My guess is that, like in most western countries, Christianity gets more and more marginalised in US politics, becoming an uninfluential fringe faction, like socialism. This is a huge blow to it's momentum, and we end up with a much more secular USA, with a much patchier bible belt. We don't have candidates like Santorum and Huckabee pulling the Republicans socially right.   Gay marriage and possibly decriminalisation of weed comes through a bit earlier.  The big question is the character of the two parties without the elephant of Christianity in the room. I'm not an American, or an expert on their political history, but I think that in the civil rights era the Dems weren't the party of progressive values that they are now. Maybe the republicans would have gone down a more libertarian route. Still pro-rich, but also pro-civil-liberties.

USA gets a new new deal in the 90s, including universal healthcare, maternity leave, and other such stuff comparable with European centrist states. States' rights diminish. Gun control advances. Meanwhile the right wing has a very active and principled opposition party culture, defining themselves in how they oppose Democrat executive and legislative action.  Economically, the USA is probably better off. Housing crisi SD might not have happened, as the financial sector wouldn't have been so deregulated.

HistoryWhatIf,3amxvq,TurboMadrass,3,Sun Jun 21 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"This was actually asked three months ago, here is my response at that time:   I wrote a fairly long alt history on this back on the old historicalwhatif sub that is ofcourse now lost. Here is a brief version of that:  If the Spartacist Uprising had been successful in convincing the Volksmarinedivision troops guarding Berlin to join them, then they most likely could have taken Berlin. With hundreds of thousands of armed supporters, control of the capital, and dozens of like minded revolts breaking out throughout the country, it is likely the Spartacists could have achieved control of Germany. It would have been a protracted Civil war though, lasting at least a couple of years.  However,by late 1920 Luxemburg is presiding over a Communist Germany being governed by a more Libertarian Communist/ Luxembergist form of revolutionary socialism (i.e. the KPD would be made up of soviets and worker's councils, it would not be crushing the authority of them).  With Europe in shambles, the Western powers like France and England are unwilling to try and stop the Spartacists from consolidating their power. Russia meanwhile is undergoing its civil war.  Initially the Bolsheviks and Spartacists are allied, but, as the bolsheviks increasingly suppress and wage war on other socialist groups, and as they try to reassert their control over eastern europe, the Spartacists begin to break with Moscow.  Eventually the Spartacists give Russia an ultimatum to withdraw from Poland and Ukraine or Germany would cease providing aid and support to the Bolsheviks. When Russia refuses the Germans begin sending aid to anti-bolshevik socialist elements, like Makhno in Ukraine. And, when the Kronstadt rebellion occurs, the Spartacists take the opportunity to support it -- sending their navy and an expeditionary force that comes into actual conflict with the Russian military.  With Germany aiding the non-bolshevik socialists, the Russian Civil War develops quite differently. After Kronstadt an armed coup by socialist, anarchist and dissenting bolsheviks topples Lenin's government. The new regime alligns itself with the Spartacists, and Germany officially enters the Polish War and the Russian Civil War on the side of the new Moscow government.  With Germany, Russia and all of Eastern Europe under the control of something along the lines Luxemburgism, a much different version of socialism because the norm (as opposed to the Leninism and Stalinism of OTL). With an allied bloc of nations in 1924 stretching from Germany to the Pacific ocean, this Revolutionary Democratic Socialist model influences revolutionaries in Asia, the rest of Europe and the new world.  The economic and technological power of this bloc and their willingness to aid social revolutionaries without dictating to them, causes the socialist movement to be less divisive and more potent than it was in OTL.  A fear of the growing power of the Communist movement causes more reactionary governments to rise up in France and England. America and Japan also ally with France and England, while Italy and the Balkans eventually fall to Comintern backed revolutions by 1930.  In 1936 England and France support a military takeover of Spain, leading to a Civil War between reactionary, republican and socialist forces. What at first seems to be a proxy war between the Capitalist and Socialist nations eventually leads to outright war. The final straw being when a violent repression of a socialist demonstration in Paris leads Germany and the rest of the Comintern to invade France.  WW2 thus plays out as America, England, France and Japan fighting against Germany, Russia, Italy, Eastern Europe and pro-socialist revolutionaries in China, Indochina and India."
HistoryWhatIf,3amxvq,hamjam5,2,Mon Jun 22 04:20:22 2015 UTC,"Very thorough response, bravo.  I am curious, but perhaps your /r/historicalwhatif post covers my question. In the OTL, foreign intervention had begun in Russia before the first world war had even concluded. The West would not tolerate a revolution in Russia, it is doubtful they would wait so long to respond with force against revolution in Germany. Especially with it being so much closer to the back yards of Great Britain and France.  I recognize that the prompt calls for successful Spartacists, but this line of thinking now has me fascinated with the notion of the first world war carrying on into the 1920's (in effect, anyhow. Treaty of Versailles notwithstanding) against successive European Marxist revolutions.   do we see an Orwellian ""we have always been at war with Eastasia"" effect as the geographical allies reshuffle? does France seize the opportunity to further twist the knife, and annex even more territory? who even wins such a war? Germany has disarmed by this point according to the treaty and Russian industry is a wreck, but the West is weary. how totalled is the global economy after such a long, protracted, decade-long World War? how long could such a war last? What are the political consequences? do we see some kind of freak-show like a kind of global fascism emerge as a third option after The Great Imperialist-Communist War [1914-1924] lays waste to the industrialized nations of earth?"
HistoryWhatIf,3amxvq,btw339,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:16:49 2015 UTC,"Great question.   While you are of course correct that there was Western/ Capitalist intervention in the Russian Civil War, the reason I don't think those powers would have interfered with the Germans is because the Russians were much worse off than the Germans after World War 1, and, even so, look at how ineffective the interference with the Russian Civil War was. Thus, interfering with the Germans would have meant a much larger operation than what was tried in Russia, and would have meant a restarting of the War -- and that is not something the west, especially France, was ready for. France already was having massive issues with armies mutinying, and they were close themselves to some sort of revolution. Restarting the war, but now having the ideological issues be at the heart of it, this would have probably led to France falling to socialist revolutionaries as well.   Overall I think Europe was just too spent to be willing to restart the war, and the U.S. was not in a state yet to do it alone. I think World War 1 is indeed allowed to end, the Socialists are allowed to take over Germany, Russia and Eastern Europe -- but that things are tense, and that the instability and revolutionary fervor of nations like Italy and Spain would have undoubatable led to this powder keg being ignited into a 2nd World War by the 30's (when the Spanish Civil War occurs) if not sooner in the late 20's (Due to Italian instability or due to civil war in Greece)."

A wonderful spectrum of Protestants that hate each other sometimes more than they hate Catholics.   Since the HRE would splinter into chaos if Clement sided with Henry, especially that sweet French alliance Clement was hoping for, it's hard to predict exactly the turn of events. Many Catholics in England would be rightfully outraged by their King's flaunting of Catholic law and of course some Protestants would be equally disgusted by further signs of the degeneracy of the Papacy. If Henry continues to marry Catholics though, instead of his switch to Protestants, and the succeeding monarchs of England are still Catholic there's a chance Henry's descendants could properly marry into the French or Spanish lines and repair alliances that way. Though that certainly seems like something that would retard British union (although it's not as if the English were ever Protestant enough for the Scottish Kirk).   As I was trying to say earlier, at some point there would be a popular movement towards Protestantism that the English Monarch would eventually have to answer for. The noblemen could rally to oust the Catholic royals or if there's a Catholic majority among the noblemen, well, the rich and powerful noblemen then harsh suppression against the Protestants. Obviously relatively peaceful coexistence would be the practice for quite a while until the population of Protestants and their relative success on the continent proves intolerable for the English Protestants living under the Catholic yoke who haven't emigrated.   Henry VIII's switch and Bloody Mary's reversal followed by Elizabeth I's unique middle-road approach to English Protestantism resulted in a unique religion which is Protestant in character but ceremonially Catholic. It's a compromise that managed to appease enough people to work. I assume a later populist Protestant uprising would result in a much less ""popish"" English church."

The sino-Soviet Split that Nixon used in OTL (and helped in facilitating that introduction of foreign investment) could be healed by a common rivalry with a western India. If that happened, and China used more soviet style systems, and bought heavy industry products from them rather than work on developing their own, as in OTL, then they would have a hard time catching up, as India does today. If, however, that stays split, then yes, I think it would be a close race between the two. Chinese industry would long term suffer though if India was the first into light manufacturing and the service sector (which would probably be its strong point, with the large population and relative common-ness of English), as that helped China get its boost, so it would have to wait for the established industries to find India too expensive for manufacturing/commercial work before moving to cheap Chinese labor"

You could have the GMD pull back from Northern China and establish a perimeter on the Yangtze River, essentially partitioning mainland China between North and South. This would also ensure that Mao is much more wary of intervening in the Korean War, which could even discourage Kim Il-Sung from starting the war in the first place. Since the Korean War in real life was a huge boon to the Japanese economy as many of the UN forces were supplied by Japanese industry, and hence the Korean War greatly aided Japan in recovering from World War Two. You could screw Japan's economy even harder by having Trinity fail, necessitating a US invasion of Japan.   Perhaps the US, burdened by the cost of having to launch an invasion of Japan is less able to provide aid to West Europe, resulting in a weaker or even non-existent Marshall Plan. This results in a slower recovery of all the Western European economies. For Germany, specifically, you could also have D-Day fail completely, thus allowing the Soviet Red Army to potentially seize all of Germany. IRL East Germany's industry was gutted by Soviet pillage, and if the Soviets were able to do so to all of Germany, the German recovery from the war would be greatly hindered. (Esp. if all of it was forced under communism).   You could essentially cripple the post-war economies of China, Japan, France, Germany, the UK and Italy with the above, all of which are above India in terms of Nominal GDP, which greatly helps India in getting that #2 spot."

At the time of the Battle of Midway, America was actually diverting most of it's war effort to the Atlantic Theater to aid the Allies. Losing at Midway may have refocused America's priorities toward a much stronger Pacific Theater appoarch. To answer your question: yes, I think if Nagumo had caught the American carriers off guard with a first strike; with his planes properly equiped to attack carriers, then the entire American fleet would have been at his mercy; and thus the Battle of Midway would have been a crushing defeat, but the Japanese never had a plan to conquer America, it was their hope to knock America off it's feet long enough for them to gain territory, and build up their defenses for what they were sure was going to be a very strong counter-attack.

It would be very nasty fighting with the use of flamethrowers, napalm, and other stuff. Japan would be so decimated after that I feel they would almost never recover. Also, remember that the US army was going to drop multiple nuclear bombs across the mainland before invading, which would cause immense causalities for the Japanese and a huge amount of long term problems for the US troops as radiation sickness and cancer would be a major problem.    Even if the allies were so decimated that they had to stop, the Japanese would still lose as the Soviets would just invade from the north and wipe out any meager resistance that is left. This is the main reason why they surrendered and isn't talked about too much in history class. It wasn't the nukes they were afraid of, it was fighting and losing all their people and then being taken over by fascisms greatest enemy, communism. If you think about it, why would the Japanese army care if they lost 50k, 80k, or 100k people? They had been losing thousands of people due to Allied bombings for years. It was more due to not Allied military power but fear of communist take over and elimination of their history and culture.  So no, there was little to no chance of the Japanese successfully defeating or causing the allies to fail in operation downfall. They just didn't have the power or supplies to stop such a massive amount of weapons, troops, and firepower. However, they would have definitely inflicted an insane amount of losses for the allies."

So Hitler hopes that he can swing a deal with the Western allies to re-arm the Germans and throw back the Soviets. The bad news for Hitler is a. the Western Allies have no interest in this deal, and b.the Germans didn't really stop the Western allies from marching on Berlin, the decision was made to let the Soviets soak up the casualties in Berlin, so the rest of the Allies waited at the river Elbe, which is just West of Berlin.   If the Soviets had been thrown out of Berlin by a conventional force,  then American, British, and French troops could have marched in from the West, facing many of the same obstacles as the Soviets but probably rolling over the city by Mid May.   So the outcome of the war wouldn't have changed, except the Western Allies would have had a little more bargaining power at the Potsdam conference, the people of post-war Berlin would have been better off with less Soviet raping and pillaging, and Stalin would have probably killed all the ranking officers involved in losing Berlin.

HistoryWhatIf,3ahu2y,KinshasaKongo,3,Sat Jun 20 08:55:10 2015 UTC,"A good question indeed. I wrote a response to a similar question a while back so here it is again. Let me know if there's any areas that you wish to expand on or clarify.   The Western Front  In this timeline, the French mobilize pre-emptively and decide to persist with their original plan for the Saar Offensive with a full forty division force with a great deal of armour and air support.  The Siegfried Line is reached swiftly due to token resistance but stops there temporarily as heavy guns are brought up to breach the defences and secure a breach through the line. They are surprised to find it was not as strong as initially thought and scatter the second rate divisions that are lacking tanks and air support.  The Germans react by recalling multiple divisions from Poland, at least more than the six they did in reality to counter the pressure of the serious offensive action, buying Poland a little more time but it will be impossible to save them before Warsaw falls due to the surprise Soviet invasion. Poland falls some weeks or even a month later than it did thanks to the French attack and many more Polish units retreat southwards to Romania so they can evacuate and continue the fight in France.  Buoyed by their initial success, the Allies continue to pour more divisions through the breached Siegfried Line and advance into the Ruhr to seize key German war industry. The RAF and French Airforce also invest the majority of their strength in this offensive and initially enjoy total superiority until the Luftwaffe pulls out of Poland, though it is low on bombs (50% of their pre-war stockpile was consumed already) and losing the industry needed to replenish itself, ground forces are equally hurting for equipment after the invasion of Poland.  By mid 1940, the German forces are struggling to muster the materiel they need to counter attack and are slowly being forced back. Support for the Nazi party begins to decrease rapidly whilst communists and democratic parties gain underground support.  Hitler refuses to sue for peace against the advice of his Generals, who react by forcibly removing him from power both to end the war while they can still negotiate and prevent any chance of a communist movement capitalizing on the unrest. The rest of the Nazi party leadership and Waffen-SS are arrested and imprisoned, some die in vain counter-coup attempts whilst others yield without a single shot.  Germany is immediately obliged to release its annexed territories, demilitarize the Rhineland and restore its part of Poland. War reparations are not as harsh due to the swift victory and relatively low loss of life for the Allies, who might need German resources to deal with the issue of Soviet occupied eastern Poland.  The Winter War and Eastern Poland  Confident he has a free hand after the lack of Allied response to the Soviet declaration of war on Poland in 1939 but cautious about their proactive nature on the Western Front, Stalin turns his hand to the invasion of Finland, considering it to be fair game.  The invasion flounders as it does in reality and the emboldened Allies plan an intervention to save Finland and contain Soviet expansionism. The Soviets decide to negotiate a settlement with the Finns and seize Karelia so they can fortify the inner Polish and the East Prussian borders as the Allies deploy to deter further Soviet incursions.  Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigns due to his ill health and Winston Churchill is selected to succeed him due to his previously unpopular strong stance against communism and Nazism. He is determined to find a way to free eastern Poland before it is made into a puppet state but no immediate action can be taken as the Allies build up in western Poland.  The three Baltic States become a flashpoint as they decide to resist in the hope of spurring an Allied intervention. At the East Prussian border, Lithuanian troops fleeing to the Allies attract a Soviet artillery barrage that strays into British positions. Mistaking it for a precursor to a Soviet invasion, they return fire and the situation spirals out of control as the RAF are called in to find and bomb the artillery positions.  Stalin is soon informed of the incident but is persuaded to calm it down as the rest of the Soviet forces are in no position to attack along the rest of the border, coupled with their miserable performance in Finland and the Purges. Churchill is also persuaded by the French not to escalate the attack as they too are not ready for a full scale war against the USSR.  Both sides continue to prepare for war, but it is not clear who will attack first. Though if the Allies succeed, they could push Stalin to yield Poland and possibly the Baltic States as he would not be dealing with extreme ideologies looking to outright conquer the USSR."

The league of Nations (similar to OTL) grants mandates to the French and the British. The French are given Syria and Lebanon, and Britain receives Mesopotamia and Palestine. However, in this timeline the League of Nations intercedes and suggest that Britain and France coordinate in fostering the generation of an Arabic federation to counter resurgent Turkish nationalism (OTL's Turkish War of Independence).  The plan is to unite the Arabic world under a federalized system of Arabic states. So the British and French compete with each other to establish a strong state by which the Arabic territories can galvanize an effective federation. The British decide to side with Abdul Aziz of the Sultanate of Nejd, and the French support the Kingdom of Hejaz, lead by Ali Bin Hussein. The French hope that his role as Sharif of Mecca will help draw more support from Muslim communities. However with British assistance, Abdul Aziz (Ibn Saud) of the House Saud is successful and becomes the Ruler of The Sultanate of Nejd and the Kingdom of Hejaz. Abdul Aziz (effectively ruler of Saudi Arabia) however supported by the British and supports the notion of a federation of Arabic nations.  He invites the other nations of the Arabian peninsula to join. The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, and the British protectorates of Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar join what is being called in the west the Arabic Federation. Ibn Saud is the nominal head of this federation and he successfully gathers the support of independent Arabic tribes within Arabia and places such as Jordan.   In 1938, petroleum is discovered in Saudi Arabia by American geologists. This massively improves the economy of the country which sells its oil rights to Britain (Ibn Saud honoring the support he received from the English) and the U.S.. Ibn Saud comes to dominate the federation and becomes involved in several localized wars for control - perhaps with succession in Yemen and Jordan. The Arabic federation grows to be one of the largest and most successfully organized bodies under Ibn Saud's leadership.  Anti-turkish sentiments are still strong in the Levant, and the issue becomes particularly heated over whether Turkey should have Mosul or not. The federation weighs in against Turkey and causes issues for the young republic as much as it can.   In World War II, the Arabian Federation does not intervene but favors the allies and continues to supply petroleum and other goods to their side.   Following this, the Federation becomes increasingly divided over sectarian issues. The foundation of the State of Israel, and a strong zionist movement push the Arabian Federation to the limits. Saudi Arabia had been the leader of the federation for many years but due to increased international pressure from the U.S. and Britain they cannot resolve to wage war on the fledgling state. The federation devolves into a league of nations type entity with each country putting their own interests first, and it becomes essentially a council by which the Arabic member-nations can insularly deal with disputes. Eventually breaking up during the middle-to-late Cold War period."

Russian traders continue to mingle with the Hawaiian natives and some natives even adopt the Russian alphabet and Orthodox Christian religion. As contact continues the British, and to an extent the Americans, see Russia as a threat. The Russians are forced to make a deal, either hand over Gavayi, Alyeska, or face war. The Russians decide that Gavayi is a better post and sell off Alyeska to the British and Americans for 35 million Rubles. Some Russian families stay but without suppport of the crown little supplies and new settlers reach the remote communities. The days of Alyeska are over.  Many of the citizens of Alyeska migrate to Gavayi and make a new settlement in modern day Pearl Harbor, Gonolulu. Gonolulu prospers, and natives join the Russians. By 1900, over 20% of all people in Gavayi identify as Russian. Many political prisoners are sent here to make sure they do not cause trouble on the mainland.  When World War I starts, the German Pacific fleet bombards and captures Gavayi for several months, forcing the people into a type of slavery. Small rebellions start as the smarter, stronger of the political prisoners flee into the dense jungle. The British and Australians arrive and clear the island after a few more months, and freedom fighters come out of hiding, only to be attacked by the Australians as a misunderstanding. Australians marines withdraw leaving the British, and many citizens after the occupation look for something new after Mother Russian abandoned them.  When the Russian civil war starts, Gavayi declares neutrality, and independence is considered. Though another war starts, as farmers and workers take over Gonolulu and declare a Soviet Republic. By 1925 a fleet is dispatched to meet with the leaders of Gavayi. Officially on May 25, 1926, Gavayi becomes the 9th SSR of the Soviet union. The natives become greatly oppressed and basically wiped out, except for a few villages on smaller outlying islands. A new immigration occurs as over 15,000 Russians are sent to Gavayi.

Independent of each other they would most likely be defeated and absorbed by the Seljuks, Ottomans, Mamluks etc. So let's say the states are founded in the same way, Baldwin of Boulogne founds the County of Edessa after his adoption by Thoros. His community is largely Armenian and Syriac orthodox christians. Around the same time (1099 I believe), Jerusalem is captured and Godfrey of Bouillon is named king. This leads to cooperation between the County of Edessa and the expanding Kingdom of Jerusalem. This is vital as the County of Edessa, unlike other Crusader States is land-locked and rather difficult to defend. The  Frankish lords of Edessa establish a great relationship with the native Armenian and Syriac people by inter-marrying with the local nobility. This becomes the policy of the Kingdom of Jerusalem as well.When Godfrey dies, and Baldwin is proclaimed king of the kingdom of jerusalem he becomes nominal ruler of both the County and the Kingdom. He merges the two administratively, but the territory is divided with the Principality of Antioch being in his way. in 1100, Bohemond is captured by the Danishmends and Tancred is named regent. Tancred the Norman, decides [point of divergence] to accept vassalage to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Jerusalem becomes the central power in what is a essentially a holy roman empire type confederacy. This is strengthened by the addition of the County of Tripoli, who again acquires vassalage from the Kingdom of Jerusalem. By 1101, the confederacy is in essence complete and now seeks to ratify through marriage alliances within the crusader states to bind it together into a cohesive feudal state under Baldwin I of Jerusalem. Baldwin's military capabilities lead to the expansion of the Kingdom itself, and the defense of the counties and principalities that operated under his suzerainty. He embarks on policies of immigration leading to numerous latin christians arriving in the holy lands which through his policy of inter-marriage with the local populace increases bonds of unity between the various social strata. Once the kingdom is secured, he begins a series of religious edicts that support christianization (tolerant to Orthodox communities) but do not imply persecution of other religious communities, nor are Muslims or Jewish people excluded from the operations of government. By Baldwin's death in 1117, the crusader states are now a organized entity with latin-native christian leadership. Baldwin of Bourcq becomes his successor and continues his policies. His greatest achievement is beginning the process by which the independent states go from vassals to part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Under the next series of kings, the independent crusader states eventually coalesce into a unified body whereby they are indistinguishable from one and another. From there the Kingdom becomes increasingly defensive successfully repelling Seljuq, Fatimid, Mamluk, Saracen. They become vassals of the Ilkhanate, rather than resist and when that collapses they reassert their independence. During 13-15th centuries we see the Crusader states completely unify and become a complex marriage of Latin and Orthodox christianity with a strong latin community. This is due in part to the successful policies of Baldwin, who has established collaboration between natives and immigrants to the degree where they have established a strong christian state.   Now from the 12th century onwards, it's just guess work - the frame work of unification would provide the states with the necessary ability to come to each others aid - meaning less easily conquered. religious tolerance would mean that neighboring muslim powers would not have to aggressively assert themselves in the Holy Land to protect muslim communities. That being said war is war, and aggressors will still attack.  The other important thing is the continuous immigration of latins and orthodox communities for the simple reason that this state will have to be militarily the strongest in the region (for a long time). It will also need near continuous support from the major medieval powers and a lot of financing, trade and logistical support.   The reformation might not have a great impact on the Crusader states who are too far away to offer any real assistance to the Catholic side. Numerous German, French and Dutch Catholics emigrate to the Crusader States in a sort of second wave, revitalizing the States and leading to a 'golden age' of tolerance.   The Crusader states survive through the age of discovery via their European alliances, and continue to grow as a curious mixture of Armenian/European/Syriac cultures.  World War 1 occurs and the Crusader states now vastly divergent from Europe, do not become involved in the war. The British never gain control over the Levant, but do have influence in the Middle-East and Egypt and have been rivals of the Crusader States since their arrival in the region.   Curiously, if WWII happens, where in the aftermath would the Jewish people settle. If the British cannot partition Palestine because of the Crusader state, perhaps, with collaboration between the States (presumably) Constitutional Monarchy and the British - allows jewish settlement.  Overall, the Holy land is more christianized than in OTL. The Crusader states are a stable non-theocratic power with strong ties to the Vatican. the issues in a modern geo-political context are changed dramatically to the point where it's pure speculation as to whether the States would become the object of Arabic nationalist aggression, or whether they would be accepted part of the Levant/Syrian landscape. It would be impressive for a community of essentially foreign christians to establish a hegemonic, then, collaborationist government that would last nearly a millennium without becoming embroiled in a conflict which would end it's sovereignty.   That's my attempt, I hope you like it."
HistoryWhatIf,3aawx0,HaydenHank,19,Thu Jun 18 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"For this to happen I imagine that Mussolini would have to deny himself the ambitions of an Italian empire in the Mediterranean. Mussolini was an incredible agitator in both North Africa and the Mediterranean. This would not place him at odds with France and Britain. Most likely, Italy would supply support to Franconists in Spain and have cordial relations with the Nazis because of ideological solidarity.  Neutrality would preserve Italy - Italy despite having 'great power' status was lagging behind the rest of Europe in the Industrial sector. Mussolini's advisors estimated that Italy would not be ready for a major military campaign until 1942, and this forces him to abandon his rhetoric of territorial successor to Rome. When war is declared (In the OTL - Mussolini hesitated to join the war - so this presents another point of divergence), Italy has no choice but to declare neutrality. It believes that modernization has to happen, and it must (like Spain) prepare for the worst. Similar to the OTL much of the 1939 budget (approx. 40%) goes to military expenditure. Italian industry flourishes, however, due to Mussolini's economic policies. The Fascist government makes alliances and supports fascists movements in Southern Europe. they also acquire vital trade agreements from other nations in Africa, the Levant and Turkey.   Italy's neutrality doesn't open up fighting in North Africa, allowing the allies to devote massive amounts of resources to the fight the Nazis on the 'western front'. In the later war timeline, it also doesn't open a third front for the Nazis to fight on in Collaborationist northern Italy. This benefits the Nazis slightly but does not mean that they can win the war.   The war drags on possibly a few more years with the Nazis avoiding being dragged in to support the weak Italian military (apparently all three services of the Italian military barely coordinated with one and other - so no surprises they didn't do so great in any theatre). It does however end with a total Nazi defeat possibly later but I just can't see the extra troops being able to stop the juggernaut of the Soviets, or Hitler's inevitably foolish declaration of war on the U.S.   Post-war - Italy remains a fascist power under the helm of Benito Mussolini. However some of the key tenements of Italian fascism were undermined by Mussolini's policies of neutrality. First, the nationalistic intention of spazio vitale (living space) and the restoration of Italian dominance of the Mediterranean don't happen - this means domestic support isn't as large for the Fascists in power. Secondly, Mussolini never - arguably - built a true Fascist state, his government essentially relied on the good will of the Italian Monarchy - King Victor Emmanuel III dismissing Mussolini leading to civil war between fascist collaborators and Italian liberal forces. SO perhaps, rather than aggressively espousing the restoration of an Italian empire, Mussolini, instead focuses on establishing a stable fascist state. He continuously builds a cult of personality which eventually culminates in the use of the Squadristi in a palace coup, thus achieving a 'better and more stable' fascist state. Mussolini's regime would instead focus on industrialization and communist suppression. Italy would emerge from the war relatively unscathed and would most likely become a haven for fugitive nazi elements. Mussolini, like Franco, would be the nation's leader throughout the cold war period until his death. The U.S., France and Britain would become interested in supporting Mussolini's anti-communist rhetoric and his influence over neighboring countries (Italy's military being the strongest in Southern Europe post-war).   Fascism fragments and collapses in the seventies, as the Fascist government becomes increasingly corrupt and undermined by communist and liberal movements. Eventually, the Fascist party's control over Italy is lost and it is broken down into smaller neo-fascist parties and right-wing ultra-conservative christian parties. Italy has a more lasting tradition of totalitarianism, and Mussolini is remembered as something of a benevolent dictator for avoiding bringing Italy into a devastating war. His country was highly industrialized under his regime. However, his use of force to suppress opposition earns him much disrepute especially in regards to his government's later collaboration with mainland Italian criminal groups - the Camorra and the 'Ndrangheta."

HistoryWhatIf,3aaf2t,Gonzno,13,Thu Jun 18 14:35:07 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at it. I'm gonna assume some things, and take actual history into account also. Still, this is made up, and meant only for entertainment.  The British aristocracy, for the most part, supported the South- they didn't like the republican example the North set- free elections, no nobles, etc. So, for the sake of this question, in the summer of 1862 they manage to force the issue and declare war. Remember, before the Battle of Antietam, the North couldn't claim the moral high ground and say they were freeing the slaves. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the South was doomed. But, England declares war before that, and France joins them. Both want cotton, England wants to show that nobility and aristocracy works, and France wants a New World empire to replace the Louisiana Purchase.  In actual history, Prussia curbstomped France in the Franco-Prussian War. Like, what Germany almost did in 1914 with the Schlieffen Plan, they actually managed to do. So, assuming that the Prussians can read the signs, they gear up when tensions run hot, and when France declares war on the US with Britain, the Prussians are ready.   France sees the divided US as a chance to restore French power in the New World- with the US unable to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, supplies, and most importantly, men, are sent to the civil war in Mexico and defeat the republican rebels. Their navy, along with that of the English, is initially wildly successful against the US Navy- the building program to make theirs the world's largest navy hadn't yet finished, nor the ironclads. But, they left themselves open.  Prussia, seeing France vulnerable, declares war and quickly moves in. With French troops busy in Mexico, English troops busy in Canada (more on them later), and both countries' navies busy, there isn't much to stop them. Paris is taken very quickly, just like in our timeline, and France is forced into a humiliating peace treaty. I'm going to assume late summer of 1863 this part finishes.   When England declares war, they initially are unready for it. Ships have to be transferred from various fleets around the world. India, China, South Africa, the Caribbean, home ports, etc. It takes time to do all this. Soldiers have to be mustered up, loaded up, and shipped over across the Atlantic. Lincoln and his cabinet and generals aren't idiots. They know what is coming.   At this point, it is no longer a semi-unpopular war to forcibly reunite the country. It is now a defense against hostile powers. Memories are still fresh of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Popular opinion swings rapidly, and men sign up by the thousand to join the military. While still green, the Army and Navy grow very quickly. Nor are there anti draft riots that plagued the Northern war effort. While the US Navy is initially fighting out of its weight, they have the advantage of home ports, higher morale, and a rapidly growing force, with more ships entering the struggle everyday.   Further in US favor, the armies of England and France are almost drained because of the Crimean War. There simply aren't a lot of soldiers right now. With the French putting their troops into Mexico, the British decide to put theirs in Canada and threaten  New England. I'm going to assume they are done with the build up by the spring thaw of 1863.   Lincoln needs a general who can lead the Army of New England- McClellan is still popular with the troops of the Army of the Potomac. Grant is fresh from a hard fought but costly victory at Shiloh. Lincoln, seeing an aggressive and competent general, promptly appoints him in charge, with orders to stay on the defensive. Fighting on four fronts- Virginia, New England, the Mississippi River, and the Atlantic is almost stretching US resources to the limit. New troops and ships are entering the fight daily, but they are still hard pressed.   The South is not sitting still in all of this. Because of English and French naval activity, they are able to trade cotton and other cash crops for guns, shoes, bullets, and other supplies. While still smaller in number compared to the North, they are better fed and equipped than in our timeline. Lee plans a spring campaign that, along with the British, will hopefully force the North to see the fight as hopeless and that it will cost way too many lives, too much time, and too much money to win.  As the campaign opens up, they initially make good progress. Lee's veterans, in high spirits, force the Army of the Potomac back from several key spots along the river they are named for. But, since they are fighting purely on the defense, each crossing is gained in blood. McClellan contests the crossings, and Lee's northward advance, but let's face it, Lee was a better general. He begins to advance north, and almost makes it to Gettysburg. Hopes are high of a linkup with English troops.  With the spring thaw, British troops march south. Along with Canadian soldiers eager to avenge the US invasions during the War of 1812, they begin their advance. Two armies are marching- a smaller one in Windsor, moving to take Detroit, and the other moving from Ottawa to move south down the coast and take Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. This will do two things- relieve pressure on the Royal Navy, which is hard pressed to hold down the ever growing power of the US Navy, and also to attempt to show the upstart Americans that they can't win this war and force their surrender before they get too powerful. Unfortunately, they didn't plan on stubborn US resistance.   In friendly territory, on short lines of supply, Grant's well supplied army is ready to face the English. With heavy defensive works rivaled only by those of Washington DC, Grant is ready. While the British attempt to force their way past these works, and meet little success, they are blind to the Appalachian Mountains. Just before they can claim success, they are undone. A large cavalry force under Sheridan's command force through a weak British screen and interrupt their supply lines. Seeing their opponents weak and demoralized, Grant's tired but elated troopers go on the offensive, and after some of the hardest fighting of the war, shatter the English soldiers. That defeat, combined with the threat of losing the naval conflict, forces them, in the face of a massive shift in popular opinion, to concede defeat to the US. There are simply too many wooden ships coming into play against them, and the new ironclads rushed into production mean they can't get too close to major cities either. They can't bring their own experimental ironclads over, either- towing them across the Atlantic just isn't possible.   With Lee defeated at Gettysburg, similar to our timeline, the British defeated north of Boston, and the French knocked out with the capture of Paris, the North is looking good right now. With these coups in hand, Lincoln is riding a massive surge in popularity. He issues the Emancipation Proclamation, both giving the North the moral high ground and forcing the governments of England and France to stop fighting or explain to their people they are supporting slavery.   Seeing that England and France are out of the picture, it is far easier for Northern advances to happen in 1864. With an even larger army and navy than in OTL, Vicksburg and the rest of the Mississippi River come under Union control. Atlanta falls shortly after, and in the east, Grant forces Lee back all the way to Richmond that much sooner. While there is still vicious fighting, and casualties are high, the South falls a few months before OTL.  Hope ya'll liked it. Please, give criticism as you think needed. Also, I did take some liberties with how things would happen, but not too much- I looked at what happened when Japan hit Pearl Harbor, and how fast opinion shifted from a very neutral stance to one of war."

So, figuring that England would put most of what is left of their army in Canada to invade the US, there wouldn't be many troops left to put into France- and don't forget, there was still quite a bit of mutual distrust between the two powers. They weren't quite friends yet.   So, when England learns that Prussia has invaded, there probably won't be much they can do. France is even weaker than in OTL, due to troops being sent to Mexico, they are themselves busy in the Northeast US, their navy is busy fighting the ironclads. What really can they do?   Once France falls, public opinion will almost force them to concede defeat. There is no way, with manpower shortages from both the Crimean War and the intervention in the US Civil War, that they can realistically do anything serious against Prussia. At best, they can do a meager blockade, but all that would do, I think, it start an arms race and unify the newly united Germans into creating a large enough navy to threaten the home islands.

Corruption, people gaming the system, the lawsuit culture, and an often ineffective bureaucracy will not be eliminated by switching to a system that strengthens the bureacracy, adds more incentive for people to live off the system, increased money flow through the hands of officials that could get 'lost', and more incentive for people to pursue lawsuits, since the 'government can always afford to pay out'.

During the 1980s the US and the USSR both rush to finish their Venus ships and in 1986 the USSR launches their ship, Rurik, three months later the USA launches the Columbus.   The USSR reaches orbit first but their lander breaks, the USA gets there and lands, only to find the USSR had landed, but was unable to report back, their radio broke.   the US now has to decide if they want to rescue the USSR and announce that the Soviets land first."
HistoryWhatIf,3a75gs,Historyguy81,12,Wed Jun 17 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"The US covers up the soviet victory. Either way, the USSR collapses in 1991. In the post-cold-war world the question of what to do about Venus is answered by a pro-west supranational initiative not unlike the UN (and possibly directly related to or drawn from it). Ostensibly, this International Venusian Initiative would aim to stall or block land claims or colonisation, hoping to preserve and study the Venusian biosphere. Miraculously, the international community manages this for a full decade. The 90s will be remembered as the last golden age.  It all falls apart with Putin's accession in 2000. He feels Russia isn't getting a fair say in the IVI, and he's probably right, seeing as it's at least half based on soviet blood, sweat, and tears. The 'strongman' of Russia puts a face and a rallying voice to widespread discontent with the idea of a US-led, western dominance of this tremendous new frontier. In 2002 the IVI offers modest concessions to Russia and the developing world, but Putin shocks everyone when he rejects the concessions as patently inadequate, and withdraws Russia from the IVI completely.  Together with India, Putin instates the Kosmicheskoye Agentstvo Solnechnaya (KAS), the Solar Space Agency. The competing Venusian research mission is shakily accepted by the international community in 2003, with some overlap in membership, even. The first scandal of the KAS comes when it is revealed that they had actively recruited from the least represented member nations of the IVI, offering them greater participation in KAS if they withdrew from IVI. This resulted in the withdrawal of any and all core western IVI nations from KAS. China is the only major nation in both organisations.  In 2004 several active KAS and IVI research stations are in orbit around Venus. Landing on the surface is strictly forbidden by a bilateral agreement to suspend such expeditions until joint operations can be negotiated. When an IVI station malfunctions, the IVI astronauts are forced to jettison the station and land on the surface of Venus for the first time in two years. USA makes allegations of KAS sabotage by way of a Chinese mediated joint maintenance plan. Russia rejects the allegations as absurd, stating that they'd already mobilised a search and rescue team to retrieve the astronauts. The USA orders the Russians to stand down, citing it as a violation of the no-land protocols, insisting that an IVI rescue squad will retrieve the astronauts instead. KAS goes ahead with the rescue operation nonetheless, citing safety above politics.  In a mad rush, KAS and IVI landing teams are mobilised, and not only converge on the stranded IVI astronauts, but also on the planned site of the 1986 USSR 'lost lander.' Neither KAS nor IVI are supposed to be there, and both factions accuse each other of using the stranded astronaut crisis to violate the no-land protocols. When the KAS land at the 1986 site, they claim to have discovered American IVI astronauts destroying evidence of a covered up successful soviet landing, and arrest the IVI astronauts. How they did so is a matter of fierce controversy and speculation - if their team was armed, they are in gross violation of international law.  KAS holds the IVI coverup team in detention for the entirety of 2005 as Earth is in crisis. the USA has accused Russia of multiple violations of international spacefaring protocols and international law, whilst Russia has accused USA of murdering soviet cosmonauts back in 1986 so as to claim propaganda victory for first manned Venusian landing. Russia goes public with physical evidence and testimonies from the captive IVI team. China withdraws from the IVI, and USA suffers tremendous loss of face.  In 2006, accusations are made that Sino-Russo-Indian scientists are developing colonisation craft (the 'Eurasian ark'). All three powers deny the allegations, citing international protocols prohibiting the deployment of such craft anyway. In 2007, spy plane photos are leaked of large scale unique spaceship manufacturing. The KAS dismisses allegations of ark-building again, explaining them as purely hypothetical research projects. Nevertheless the IVI begin research into their own arks (to KAS protests).   In 2008, the KAS sends a large lander back to the site of the 1986 soviet landing, to find the cosmonauts remains and build a memorial for them. This is against the no-land protocol, but they proceed nonetheless in the name of ""honour and decency"". By the years end, the large lander is still planetside, and IVI are making allegations of a permanent land base. KAS cite technical difficulties delaying a return to orbit.  In 2009, a full year after the KAS memorial mission is still planetside, IVI sends it's own semi-permanent landing crew planetside. KAS nations decry the move as a pointless violation of the no-land protocols, justifying their own as having a 'good reason' and as being unintentional. The language they use is deliberately ambiguous in it's implication that the no-land protocols are to be considered void.  The KAS reveals and launches their gargantuan colonisation fleet, including three arks, in 2010. The IVI decries the move over the now-all-but-defunct international protocols, but immediately reveals and launches their own colonisation fleet (albeit with just a single ark). The fleets land in 2011, and begin establishing permanent settlements. Meanwhile back on earth, ark construction is open and large scale.   By 2014, the KAS has sent 10 arks, and the IVI 8, each becoming their own city on Venus. In March, pro-Russia militants in Crimea separate themselves from Ukraine. As the incident unfolds, it becomes increasing clear as a Russian annexation. As the situation escalates, Ukraine is given emergency admission to NATO. War broke out in September.  That's the last we heard from earth: total radio silence since September 2014. Another ark was due to arrive three months ago; it never came. Most of the fleet was only built for the one-way trip, though we have dispatched a probe to earth to report back on the situation. We should hear about that in 2016. What happens next, here on Venus, is up to us."

We'll call it Ishtar.  It's discovered in prehistory, and even back then its bright blue-green hue makes it special to us. Ishtar plays a prominent place in myth as symbol of water and life.  In 1609, Galileo's telescope reveals more details. The planet's rotation becomes apparent: Humans can now directly observe the continental features and determine that Ishtar is a lot like Earth. They can also tell that Ishtar rotates to the west, not the east.   As astronomers study the planet, the implications for culture are big. In Europe, a debate begins about the nature of creation and the completeness of the Bible: Is Genesis wrong? Did it leave out the creation of Ishtar? Is Ishtar part of Earth? Is it part of Heaven? The obviousness of life on Ishtar makes it impossible to ignore the theological questions. The Catholic Church is shaken by these facts about Ishtar, as it burned Giordano Bruno at the stake just a few years earlier for suggesting other planets existed.   Early scientists break from the Church over Ishtar and the infallibility doctrine is fundamentally shaken. Other political crisis over the years may be the final straws, but it was the execution of Bruno that planted the seeds for the disintegration of the Catholic Church in this timeline. By 1800, the Church's authority will have become limited to a few scattered lingerers. The majority of Christian churches are state churches like the OTL Church of England or, more usually, local churches with ever-evolving doctrines.  Europe's intellectuals, who in OTL would have often joined the Church as priests, now join local libraries, universities, and governments, stimulating an acceleration in secularization.  As the Church gradually falls apart, this helps accelerate political breaks around the world. Spain's New World colonies revolt sooner - without the spiritual foundation of the Catholic Church creating more cultural unity, New Spain splits.   Mexico declares independence from Spain in the 1730s, well in advance of England's American colonies. Other Latin American colonies secede as well. They split not over ideology but rather to take power: The locals in charge decide they don't need to do everything Spain says and prefer to take the gold mined for themselves. The subsequent wars happen on and off for decades but Spain ultimately can't control anything beyond the Antilles.  The subsequent troubles in Latin America (particular even greater abuse of Natives and African slaves and lack of republican government) discourage revolution in the English Colonies. The UK argues against American independence, noting that secession from the crown has only hurt the people of New Spain. But at the same time, fear of eventual secession leads the UK to begin granting gradual representation to the American colonists."

The Iran-Iraq War started in September, 1980 and the two countries would put aside their differences to fight a common enemy. Fighting on two fronts with the Iraqis to the west and Americans to the south, the Iranian army falls back to Tehran for a long, drawn out siege. The Battle of Tehran lasts for nearly a year but the Iraqi-American forces prevail in the end. US forces occupy the cities but the countryside sees a lot of guerilla warfare (much like Iraq and Afghanistan during the US occupation in the OTL). Iraqi-US relations are at an all time high and oil and military tech flow between the two countries but a new problem emerges. The Soviets have invaded Afghanistan and a massive proxy war begins with the two superpowers sponsoring political groups and tribes in the area. Everyone is on edge with ground troops from the two nations within view of each other and locked and loaded for combat.

Secret shipments from Germany stopped as it collapsed and they had enough to survive the winter but not much longer. Being in Antarctica they can't even attempt to grow food outside 6 months out of the year because its just dark. Attempts during the light part of the year fail also because its too cold. Even with the best suspected technology they can't heat and light the hundreds of square miles required for the crops to sustain any sort of population even in underground caverns. So as soon as their stored up supplies run out they can eat each other then die or just surrender and get fed. A few hold outs tried the never surrender option but a coup replaced them before the announcement.   The U.S. and Russia race to be the rescuers as who ever gets there will get the German wonder weapons. Its a major undertaking however. Neither is prepared to send a large expedition to Antarctica to rescue a large group of people. It also has to be done before the onset of local winter which will make it impossible to get to them so hopefully the Nazis made the announcement at the start of local spring. Meanwhile the Nazis start to starve. The U.S. is going to be the first to arrive, it will drop food shipments to them flown out of New Zealand long before any one can physically get there.  Eventually rescuers arrive. The Nazis are taken away, along with as much technology as possible before winter starts.

Santa Anna broke his army into 4columns of about 700 men for two reasons; •a smaller army, like the texans, moves faster than a larger one. •the different columns could cover more ground, reducing the enemy's ability to maneuver.   The Texan army, moving faster was able to gain about two weeks, where the 900 men became trained.   The Mexican army finally caught up, expecting an attack, spent all night building a baggage breastworks. While at the same time received reinforcements.   The Texans burn the bridge, and attack the exhausted Mexican line and just ducking them up in 18 minutes.   So following your prompt; army doesn't split but catches up anyways at the same time.   Santa Anna drives his army of 2800 men at a monstrous pace. Catching up with the texicans San Jacinto. The texans made camp in a wooded area, separate from the Mexicans by a 500 yard field surrounded by a marsh and the woods.   The rangers report that the whole mex army was on the field, Houston orders the bridge burnt; Victory or Death.   Santa orders his exhausted and bloody footed soldiers the attack. The texans twin sisters blast for all their worth. The infantry poured fire into the line. The mex line broke up in the tree line. The Mexicans fall back to their camp.   They build a baggage breastworks. Expecting a counterattack in the morning.   None comes. The absolute exhausted troops force a rest.   In the hottest part of the day, the texans attack.

The texans would easily out run them. And because the army had stuck to the casino Royal. Houston would have all the room to maneuver around. He'd have the ability to hit the supply lines.   Remember that Houston was raised by the Indians and was an Indian fighter. He only committed to open battle when he had a solid advantage. The bigger fear would be if the Texas government sacked Houston because of how he fought.   Then you'd get your Santa victory. Santa would burn every settlement. The settlers would return to the U.S. The Rangers would keep fighting. It took the U.S. 9 years to get involved. The most they'd do it take refugees. No investment from Britain, France or Spain."

HistoryWhatIf,3a1w47,BizarroCullen,8,Tue Jun 16 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"Well the Allied powers certainly dramatically altered the political structure of Japan post-war. They democratized the nation, and were an occupying force until 1952 (so it's equally plausible that they could have gone the other way).  So let's just say that the Allies, do not bother trying to democratize Japan. Due to the events in the OTL that triggered what is known now as the 'Reverse Course' policy (escalating cold war, communist revolution in China and the Korean war just around the corner) where it appeared that Japan was ripe for communist growth.  Following the Tokyo trials, the Allies allow many members of the Imperial government that were acquitted and allowed them to re-enter politics. Emperor Hirohito remains a figure-head of the new political establishment headed by a prime-minister (perhaps Shigeru Yoshida or another right-wing politician), who would also act as head of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. The government's primary focus is the suppression of Communism by any means necessary.  The lack of democratization has two effects:  1) it means that the country is ruled by a one party system - who would much like in the OTL undermine ideological rights, public worker strikes and Zaibatsu-busting legislation. In fact, Zaibatsu related business grows under the one party rule. Likewise, the Yakuza grows under the protection of the puppet government. The Yakuza and Zaibatsu's ideologically oppose the spread of communism, and as other historical examples have shown collaboration between criminal elements and the government result in the violent suppression of opposition.   2) Communism becomes a bigger problem in Japan. I'm not suggesting that Communism would reach the point of revolution. In fact, I don't see the puppet regime failing at all. The initial problem were the effects of the post-war economy on Japan. Due to poverty and domestic inflation their was increased support for communism in Japan. General MacArthur knew this, and would be instrumental in establishing a puppet government in this timeline. Likewise, the complete lack of democratic reform would leave leftist parties without a legitimate avenue to power, and therefore would become subversive elements of society. If the US continued their policies they would have to economically invigorate japan (like the Marshall Plan for Europe). Indeed if the puppet regime uses a mixture of suppressing force coupled with economic stimulation eventually communism in Japan would not be seen as attractive.   Finally, the puppet government would see constant U.S. support throughout the Cold War period. Their would be numerous leftist and democratic parties that arise during this period. Japan slowly democratizes and after the leader (Yoshida) dies in approximately 1967. Democratization begins in earnest, eventually reforming the state to resemble the modern country it is now."

HistoryWhatIf,3a116i,TheWinterKing,7,Tue Jun 16 11:37:12 2015 UTC,"Wales is fairly simple, since for a long period it was not clearly distinguished from England - no capital, no separate legal system, and so on. Scotland is more difficult, and Ireland would be still more so if you had included it.  The most likely point of divergence would be the Commonwealth. During this period there was an attempt at a single government for the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland (Wales being effectively part of England). As I remember it, the constitution mandated a single head of government, the Lord Protector. There was a 21 person state council which shared executive power, and a unicameral parliament. Catholics were excluded.  There were several instabilities which led to the fall of the Commonwealth. Deal with them, and you probably answer your question.   Oliver Cromwell did not nominate a successor Lord Protector until apparently selecting his son at the last moment, and there was no defined way of selecting one. This could be resolved either by his planning ahead (as per Augustus) or by something more like a presidential election if there were a term limit rather than selection for life. The tension between Presbyterians and Independents was never resolved (or at least not until 1972). Cromwell was an Independent (Congregationalist) and opposed a state church. The Presbyterians insisted on a state church. In England the Presbyterians had favoured a reconciliation with the king, and so had lost power, but in Scotland they remained ascendant. Suppose that Cromwell had inclined to Presbyterianism - this would have reconciled the Scots, and reduced the  sectarian tension in England. It would also have further isolated the more radically left wing Independents such as the Levellers, and perhaps have forestalled the Putney Debates.  In time a Restoration might have been possible within the terms of the Commonwealth, rather than by eliminating it as happened OTL, giving rise to a constitutional monarchy more similar to that of 1688. Cromwell never managed to get a parliament together which actually worked well. This seems largely to be a matter of personalities and self-interest.   It is unlikely that any of this would help to bring in Ireland, which wasn't part of your requirement. I would see that as remaining essentially a possession."
HistoryWhatIf,3a116i,ctesibius,2,Tue Jun 16 13:16:37 2015 UTC,"In short the only possibly was is what we would today term genocide of the Welsh and Scottish people imposing England on both places so thoroughly and violently it would be studied by later people like Hitler as a model for assimilation of a conquered territory.  When Edward I finishes conquering Wales he takes a page from the Romans and doesn't just build castles all over it to control it but expels as many of the Welsh people as possible out of the area and into villages scattered across England. No more than 1-2 Welsh families per village. Then moves in English peasants to take over the abandoned land. This policy continues under his successors eliminating the Welsh as a distinct people.   The Scots are going to be harder to genocide away because of their numbers and size of the territory. The best solution here is going to be when James I inherits England. Instead of relocating to London he moves Parliament to Edinburgh. Forcing the English north into Scotland imprints their culture on the Scots by sheer weight of numbers. Making  Edinburgh the capitol (however bad a choice it might be otherwise) eliminates a major focal point of the Scots feeling separate. The kings have to impose the Anglican Church on Scotland whatever the cost (and it will be high) they can not be allowed to have a separate church. The need to enact the Dress Act earlier keep it in place longer and never cater to groups like the Highland Society of Edinburgh. The Highland Clearences need to be state policy not just events that happened. Give the highlanders a choice between being shipped to Australia or going to America freely. Forbid returns even for visits. Aggressively use Scottish units like the Black Watch, throw them into combat to die. When they retire give them land in southern England and forbid return to Scotland. Do the opposite with British soldiers who retire from the Army, give them land in Scotland (taken from the Highlanders). A lot of these are policies the Romans used to assimilate foreign countries, they worked but we consider them brutal and genocide."

HistoryWhatIf,39xyqo,btw339,17,Mon Jun 15 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"Greece becomes axis aligned, and/or Italy does not need Hitler's help to conquer Greece.  In the original timeline, the Greco-Italian War was the Italian fascist dictator Mussolini's 1940 attempt to conquer Greece to further his goal of recreating the glory of the Roman Empire. Due to many reasons, the Italian army was bogged down fighting the stubborn Greek defenders. In order to break the stalemate, Mussolini called upon his fascist German allies. With the German Wehrmacht's support, Greece is subdued by late April 1941.   However, this unexpected diversion of German strategic assets pushed back the time table for their invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, until late June 1941. Even though it was delayed, the Germans saw tremendous success due largely to Soviet lack of preparation. The Germans were on the verge of taking Moscow (the spires of the Kremlin could be spotted by German soldiers) by the time winter set in to halt Hitler's advance. The rest, as they say, is history.  This is where our 'What if?' comes in. With your fiction writing chops, I would suggest you cook up a reason for Greece being a non-issue (or at least a lesser issue) for Hitler. For example, fascist elements within Greece secure power and ally with Germany. With even an extra month or two of good campaigning time, the Soviets will be even less prepared for an invasion and the Nazis will have even more time to effect the decapitation of Soviet command, control, and transportation by 1942.   With this, Hitlers monstrous plans are put into effect. Russian, and Eastern European populations not exterminated of kept for slave labour are forced East beyond the Ural Mountains to live out pre-industrial exile in sort of an amplified Native American reservation analogue, and the depopulated region West of the Urals will be ripe as Lebensraum for Hitler's German colonist-farmers to feed a greater Germany.   More to the point of winning the wider war with the remaining Allied Powers. Hitler has essentially already done this. In the original timeline, Hitler had about three soldiers fighting Stalin for every one he had fighting ALL of the Western Allies. Suppose that one of those three is forced to remain in the occupied East to stamp out resistance and carry out Hitler's plans, that still permits a TRIPLING of force in the West, and in North Africa in order to keep the British (and all of her colonies&commonwealths), Free French and Polish, and American (eventually) forces out of His new Empire. A task that was a hard fought battle for the Allies to do BEFORE we tripled the strength of Fortress Europa. All because of tiny Greece...  Now, we STILL probably don't see Swastikas hoisted in the White House or Time Square. In fact, I doubt Hitler tries to go after London. That said, his war aims have been achieved. Germany has achieved supreme hegemony in Europe, vast farmland has been acquired in the Eastern Lebensraum in order to feed a greater German Reich. If all goes according to Hitler's plans, the conquered resources, food, and geographic size in these lands will permit his empire to grow in richness and population to rival the world powers like the (global) British Empire and the United States.

HistoryWhatIf,39xyqo,monswine,3,Tue Jun 16 07:58:33 2015 UTC,"I wrote an Alternate History short story once. It was done from the perspective of an SS officer working in Nazi America. To make it even better, I had this SS officer be Charlton Heston, who never, due to the changes in history, gets to become an actor (and thus famous), having been conscripted instead to serve as an SS officer under the Nazi puppet regime in America.  Though not included in my story, the background research I did (so I could imagine what this world would be like) took bits and pieces of other alternate history works, and here is what I came up with:  In the United States, Charles Lindbergh defeats FDR in 1940 and becomes president. Lindbergh campaigned on an anti-war platform, and this allows him to gain the presidency.  Facing a growing pro-Nazi movement (as a result of American Nazi activities), combined with his own views of white superiority, Lindbergh eventually welcomes Nazi agents into the United States in an effort to help root out Jews and other undesireables. Lindbergh, though not a Nazi himself, sees in Hitler someone who ""understands"" the  need to preserve racial blood and purity, so they end up becoming increasingly friendly until a Fascist coup, with Hitler's backing, takes place in America, deposing President Lindbergh and installing a much more agreeable American leader, to Hitler that is. In order to maintain order and the backlash against such a coup, German troops arrive in America and establish control and order.  In my short story, this is how the United States ""loses"" World War II.  Building upon the timetable I've suggested, the United States would have never been attacked by Japan because President Lindbergh would have ceased the oil embargo and any such actions that would threaten American Isolationism. Thus Japan would be able to expand against China and other European colonies with much greater ease.  Britain (and eventually the Soviet Union) would have never benefited from the ""Arsenal of Democracy."" Under a Lindbergh Administration, the Lend-Lease Act is never signed, and thus the British Isles, through U-Boat warfare, could be conceivably starved into submission or at least be militarily weakened as food and other much needed supplies are not there to feed the British and Free French troops that are waiting for a D-Day invasion.  You could also have, much earlier, Hitler never rescinding his directive to avoid bombing civilian targets and instead continuing to bomb RAF airfields, which would almost certainly guarantee a German victory in the Battle of Britain. With this done, Operation Sea Lion can occur, and the Nazis take over the British Isles.  On the Eastern Front, Britain having been defeated, the Nazis, in my opinion, are incredibly more capable of defeating the Soviets than people give them credit for. In real life, even though everyone likes to say Hitler was guaranteed to lose when he invaded the Soviet Union, one point still remains:  He came so close to pulling it off.  In your alternate history of World War II, Hitler would only need to abandon his ideological fixation on taking Stalingrad and sticking with the original plan that his commanders had created.  You might even, perhaps, have some sort of lend-lease agreement between Nazi Germany and the United States: in exchange for industrial support and military supplies, Hitler helps the US deal with its own ""Jewish Question.""  In my opinion as an amateur historian, a defeated Britain and an isolationist United States that [isn't supplying the Soviet Union] equals a complete victory over the Soviet Union. The Soviets nearly lost in real life, so losing the immense amount of US support, along with the Nazis fighting on one front, guarantees a Nazi victory.  I hope this helps in guiding you in the right direction. One of the things I was told helped make my short story really enjoyable was the lack of knowledge the reader had on to how the world came to be as it is, merely alluded to as if it were common knowledge.

HistoryWhatIf,39ynb2,gh333,8,Mon Jun 15 21:22:26 2015 UTC,"From the histories I have read while the romans were suspicious of Judaism, they tolerated and respected it. Gibbon suggested that the reason there wasn't widespread persecution of the Jewish people was because they were regarded as a nation, and not as a sect (which Christianity was). Indeed, the Roman empire was fairly tolerant of most religious practices as long as the conformed with the empire's parameters, an exception to this would be druidism in the celtic communities, which was considered fairly insidious and offered a counter to Imperial rule. The almost atheistic stance the Jewish people took on polytheism had them at odds with much of the rest of Mediterranean world. Despite this, the Romans for the most part tolerated them, they did not however tolerate rebellious attitudes in regards to taxation and attacks on Roman citizens. This and increasing religious tensions between Greek polytheism and Judaism were causing strife in the province.   That was one of the major events that led to the first Jewish revolt, now while we could take the view that perhaps if the Romans were more tolerant I don't think that would have prevented the first Jewish-Roman war. Perhaps, if the Romans had engaged in less aggressive taxation practices - the Jewish people might not have revolted in 66 CE but rather chafed under Roman rule till the 7th-8th century. They would also have to grant concessions between the two aggrieved parties principally greek and jewish religious leaders, to avoid the inevitable violent sectarian rioting.   If the first Jewish-Roman war did not happen the temple would not be plundered or destroyed. Titus would not have defeated the rebellion, reducing the prestige of the Flavian house. Another major event - would be there would not be a major Jewish Diaspora. Josephus estimates that somewhere near 1,100,000 people were dispersed from Judea by means such as slavery. Another event that would be prevented is the rise of the Rabbis. The destruction of the Second temple transferred the place of worship and meeting from the temple to the Synagogue, and from the traditional power structures into the hands of the Rabbis who would shape new Judaism.  Christianity would grow under the protection of Judaism in much the same way as OTL, but would be ostracized by the more traditional judaic religious/political structures. Christianity would still continue to blossom and would be subject to the occasional persecution by despotic rulers.   So the major differences is if the first Jewish-Roman war can be averted: 1) No Jewish diaspora - meaning a larger jewish community remaining in the Levant regions, and not spreading throughout Europe as rapidly.   2) The Second Temple isn't destroyed - Power remains in the hands of the temple and the various priestly orders. the Rabbinic period doesn't happen changing the way modern judaism is perceived.   3) Christianity would be most likely more persecuted in the Levant by the traditional jewish power structures but would still blossom throughout the Eastern portion of the empire. Eventually, reaching Rome. The Roman empire still probably becomes christian unless the lack of the Jewish war completely changes the Flavian house."
HistoryWhatIf,39ynb2,lbyrne91,2,Mon Jun 15 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"This was a super informative response. I think pointing out the effects of aggressive taxation was an especially good point.  Most of the things I have read about the time period have been in the context of studying the New Testament, and given how anti-Jewish and pro-Roman the New Testament tends to be, scholars tend to point out that in reality the Romans were quite brutal and the Jews were quite accommodating in many ways. But I think you're right to point out that the Romans didn't typically go around destroying cities if they didn't feel like it was necessary, and I obviously need to do more reading about this period to get a fuller picture.  Thanks!"
HistoryWhatIf,39ynb2,lbyrne91,2,Mon Jun 15 22:36:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely the New Testament can be treated as a fairly hostile source. Likewise, sources from the roman period can be generally thought of as hostile - Josephus was a Jewish defector to the Romans. We can also see historical examples of the treatment of Carthage where by ancient sources show villainy on their part, and virtue on the Roman side. Modern Scholars tend to be more accurate simply because we have the ability to easily detach and use retrospect to view the conflict. It certainly wasn't just a case of Jewish nationalist aggression against the yoke of the Romans, and it wasn't just a brutal reactionary response from a tyrannical power.  I think you posed a really good what if! Because it's not just a case of ""oh it couldn't happen."" It genuinely could have been avoided and the results would have been profound both religiously and historically."
HistoryWhatIf,39ynb2,crb11,2,Mon Jun 15 23:24:52 2015 UTC,"I think most of the rest of this is accurate (I'm not really an expert on the historical side) but the effect on Christianity is likely to be rather greater than you suggest. Firstly, the three Synoptic Gospels (Matt, Mark, Luke) were written clearly with the fall of the Temple in mind - Jesus prophesies its destruction, and some of the endtimes descriptions are likely to have drawn on what really happened during this war. So Christian end-times theology is going to be a bit different.  Secondly, and more substantially, the early Christian church saw disputes between Jewish and Gentile influences. Following the destruction of the Temple, the Jewish side melted away. Under this scenario we probably get a church which is split for longer (so may not spread as much), and with greater Jewish influence long-term. In addition, the Fall of the Temple would, I think, have fed into the anti-semitic narrative that has been part of Christianity at times (they killed Jesus, they lost the Temple), so the Christian world into modern times may well be a lot less anti-semitic than in our timeline."

Although they had the advantage of not sharing a border with any Central Powers nations, the infrastructure in Spain was poor compared to that of the Allied powers, and aside from warm bodies, Spain could contribute very little to the Allied war machine. In my view, Spain's addition would be similar to the addition of a nation like Greece to the Allied cause. World War I would not play out much differently, as Spain was not the military power it had been even 100 years before.   The effects after the war is where it would get interesting, however. Getting involved in the war might see Allied pressure on Spain to both commit troops and upgrade their infrastructure. In the interests of creating a more efficient war machine, nations like Britain, France and even the United States might be more prone to invest in Spain and modernize the country at a far faster pace than what was achieved in the OTL. The cost of Spanish involvement might also accelerate events like the end of the Monarchy, or the Spanish Civil War, in addition to economic stimulus. It also might lead the nation to a state of near-bankruptcy as the Spanish economy had been largely stagnant since the mid-1600's.

They already had a very close relationship with Mongolia (even propping up their government and killing dissenters) and had Soviet troops in Mongolia. I don't know how Mongolian history would have been very different as an official Soviet state. Without that buffer between the China and the Soviet Union things could have been more difficult when relations between the two communist powers began to sour.

The reason it didn't blow up in OTL is because many of the French higher-ups understood they needed to secure British alliance against the German Empire if Germany ever decided to invade France. Which it absolutely did 16 years later. If the two powers go to war over the crossmark in South Sudan on the eve of World War 1 things could spiral out of control.   The French seem to have been well aware they would lose outright to British naval superiority. A proper French victory would require forcing the British out of Egypt which doesn't seem reasonable. The British managed acquire everything they wanted without firing a shot in OTL and by the looks of it if they had they would have knocked the French right out of Sudan pretty quickly. Maybe the conflict could resolve itself there with a skirmish in an African village and the French being pushed back instead of what actually happened where the French backed down after both sides mobilized for war and both leaders of the expeditions were lauded as remarkably level-headed individuals.   Still, full colonial warfare is totally possible. France and Britain managed to stay neutral during the US Civil War but how are Russia, The Ottoman Empire, and Germany going to stand by while Britain and France literally go to war over Africa? Fashoda could be the spark that ignites a very different World War 1 than the one we're used to."
HistoryWhatIf,39ujvt,monswine,3,Mon Jun 15 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"If shots were exchanged then the French party would loose, badly. The British party was better armed and the French was hundreds of miles from their nearest supply port. The logistics mean that should any significant conflict arise around Fashoda then the British would probably win because they controlled the best supply route in the area (the Nile). That and the fact that it would give the British an excuse to seize full control of the Suez Canal, which the French government still owned shares in, would probably mean that the French would give way and a diplomatic solution would be found.   So there would probably not be a hot war in 1899, but there would be a lot of bad blood between the two great powers meaning that the Entente Cordial is now not going to happen. Without the Entente Kaiser Wilhelm is not going to be so provocative in trying to break it up, and might even try to get an alliance once he gave up on the naval race in 1906.   So, the Kaiser is a bit less of an arse during the Edwardian period, but other than that history carries on as normal. Assuming that WW1 kicks off as it did, this is when the major changes happen because Britain remains neutral. The French stop the Schleiffen Plan as they did in our time line and the western front bogs down into trench warfare, but the only British there will be salesmen trying to sell material to both sides.  By 1917 the armies of France and Russia were basically done, and their economies were at breaking point. Germany on the other hand still has some fight left in it, and more than it did in real life because it would be able to buy supplies from both Britain and the USA. The trade routes would have stayed open simply because neither side could risk antagonising these two powers as this could lead to them siding with the other one. That would tilt the scales decisively in favour of whomever they chose.  With things in France as bad, or possibly worse, than they were in real life there would be mutinies, as there were in real life, but this time they would have nobody to relieve the pressure. The Germans punch through the lines and get back into a war of movement, but since the French do not have any more reliable troops they are going to be forced to surrender."

The questions of simultaneity and clock coordination, etc., were being discussed in other arenas prior to Einstein, and well before something like GPS came about I suspect it would have been discovered independently. (Some of the basic equations of special relativity, like the Lorentz equation, were developed completely independent of Einstein. Einstein just provided a better explanation of them.)  As for photoelectric effect and the ""old"" quantum theory — it's hard to say. Planck obviously had worked on the quantum idea but wasn't probably going to head in that direction. But would others have looked into it, from different angles? Maybe. It's very hard to say about this sort of thing.  In general, historians of science don't really put too much stock in the absolute importance of individuals.

But now that not only the Soviet Union is not receiving lend lease but that their enemy(Germany) receives it, the Germans can also send more soldiers to the Eastern front thanks to the lack of any other front which can distract German and Italian forces.

HistoryWhatIf,39pq12,lbyrne91,2,Sat Jun 13 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"Difficult question with a lot of ripples and butterflies, so let's try to form an image of just the immediate aftermath.  First off, I doubt that this saves the Byzantine Empire. In our timeline, Manzikert was a catastrophe a long time in the making due to many decades (if not centuries) of systemic problems and disunity in the Byzantine government and military. Even if Romanus IV Diogenes was more formidable (than he already was) and was able to instil the unity required to win at Manzikert as you describe, then the Militarist vs. Bureaucrat factionalism and the Diogenes vs. Doukas dynastic rivalry (among others) probably still persist, with the former getting a significant advantage. I could go on, but suffice it to say that the underlying disunity in the Byzantine Empire would continue and result in a disaster further down the line. Maybe this sets the stage for long term reform, but we're already working with too many compounded maybes and suppositions.  To the Sultan then! Now, I doubt that his capture, death, or execution dissolves the Seljuks. In fact, in our timeline he would die only a year later in his attempt to subjugate the Christian Georgians. The Seljuks probably don't see the tremendous growth that sacking Asia Minor permitted them in our timeline, but they were already a force to be reckoned with and were the single largest force in the Islamic world. This defeat does weaken the Seljuks, which is important to my second major change.  I would suggest that the Fatimid Caliphate persists somewhat longer than they did in our timeline due to reduced pressure from the reduced Seljuk Sunni strength. Now (due to their own host of problems) this probably doesn't save the Fatimids either, but I would suggest that this improves the influence of Shia Islam into the future.   The most major result is to Western Europe. Without the Seljuk influx into Asia Minor, The Byzantines are not compelled to beg the Catholic West for military aid. Therefore, the Crusades do not happen. At least not when they did, or in the same manner that they did. I cannot overstate the implications of this, or the myriad alternative routes we could take from this point. What the hell does Pope Urban II do with all of his restless European Knights? Is Western European stability thereby reduced? Does the lack of an interface with the Islamic world retard the development of European sophistication? Is there a Crusade anyway? Who would be the target of that supposed Crusade? Are any of these questions on point, or are they missing more immediate concerns?  I honestly, can't answer any of those questions with any acceptable confidence. So if I may summarize my rambling pseudo-analysis, tl;dr, as they say these days:   Byzantine Empire is probably still eventually doomed but...    * The Diogenes Dynasty and the Militarist Faction see some pre-eminence in the late 11th and early 12th centuries    * Asia Minor (modern Turkey) doesn't suffer the full ethnic cleansing at Turkic hands and retains part of its Greek populations.  The Sunni-Shia struggle over the Fatimid Caliphate is more of a struggle, at least for a while. The Crusades don't happen, at least not at the same time and/or under the same circumstances as we know them. The implications are tremendous.    Hope this was helpful!  *edit: formatting"
HistoryWhatIf,39pq12,btw339,2,Tue Jun 16 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"excellent analysis!  I find that in my understanding of the greater ramifications of a victory at Manzikert is that Romanos Diogenes was not going to be an effective post-war leader. He was as you said a member of the military aristocracy, and represented the remilitarization of the thematic system. He also was embroiled before Manzikert with tensions between the Doukas family and the civil administration. If he won the battle, he would not necessarily face the disgrace of his defeat but rather his pro-military stance and the reforms that he would most likely seek to achieve would cause ample friction between himself, the bureaucracy and the provincial government. This friction would inevitably lead to an assassination attempt, or as in the OTL a palace coup most likely headed by the Doukas family. He might be successful in the TL but in my opinion his unpopular leadership would not preserve his rule. While his reforms were needed to help stop the terminal decline of the Byzantine military, it's reliance on foreign mercenaries and the decadence of the imperial edifice, they simply weren't popular."

HistoryWhatIf,39nwqt,ImaginativeAvian,3,Sat Jun 13 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I guess the most immediate consequence would be on relations with the Teutonic Order and the Ordenstat.  One of the principle reasons Jogaila chose Poland and Catholicism over Moscow and Orthodoxy was a belief that a conversion to the Orthodox Church and alliance with Moscow would do little to prevent Teutonic aggression.    Thus, an marriage and alliance to Moscow would open the door to Teutonic-Polish reproachement.  Meaning the battle of Grunwald would never be fought in 1410, the Order's decline postponed, and Samagotia, the disputed territoritory between Lithuania and the Order would likely remain in Teutonic possession for the time being.  It would also have immediate consequences on internal Lithuanian politics.  Remember, Lithuania was embroiled in civil war, with Jogaila's cousin Vytautas being the last in a series of challenges to his rule, and his principle rival to the title of Grand Duke.  By accepting the Polish alliance and marriage proposal Jogaila also accepted the throne of Poland.  A central feature of the peace between Jogaila and Vytautas was for Jogaila to recognize Vytautas as Grand Duke, while Vytautas recognized Jogaila as his overlord.  Thus, Jogaila's marriage to the daughter of the Prince of Moscow would have meant his continued presence in Vilnius, and likely the resumption of civil war.  Longer term consequences for Moscow's expansion I couldn't really begin to guess at."

It wouldn't end local insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the emergence of radical groups like ISIS down the road. Al Qaeda wasn't a highly centralized organization, precisely to avoid a situation where the capture or death of a single person could bring it down. The way the War on Terror was reported in the US might be different, and the manhunt for other leader wouldn't be as high-priority, but that's pretty minor."
HistoryWhatIf,39njuy,commanderspoonface,3,Sat Jun 13 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"ISIS in Iraq was originally the Al-Qaeda branch in Iraq. Without Osama then the organization would of collapsed into smaller groups without the same prestige and funding and operation capability. Also the Al-Qaeda group in general grew much bigger post 2001 than pre-2001. With Osama dead the organization is weakened and ISIS does not appear.  Also the 2004 election would be much closer since in the last weeks of the election, Osama released a tape to scare the americans into not voting for Bush. Many however speculate that he intended to have an opposite effect so that americans actually voted for Bush and the US got more entangled in the mid-east in a bush victory.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Osama_bin_Laden_video  Election becomes much much loser without that tape. If Bush wins. everything that happens still happens after. However theres a less chance of an invasion of Iraq since Bush can't use the terrorism angle to justify an invasion of Iraq if Osama is Killed. If Saddam survives then by 2011 we get a reverse situation where a Shia revolt is trying to kick out secular Sunni armed troops loyal to fellow Sunni Saddam. Even though the same situation is happening in syria in the reverse.   If Kerry wins then the US retreats out of Iraq. But he has little powers with a still republican controlled congress and his agenda other than Iraq which can be controlled by the White House. Never kicks off. By 2008 due to the financial crisis. Kerry becomes unpopular and a republican candidate in 2008 wins big by blaming kerry for not forseeing the crisis.  With a retreat in Iraq. The US avoids trillions that were spent on iraq. On the otherhand there would be a brutal civil war between the Sunni and the Shia."

And Pope What's-his-hat feared the massive amount of power and influence the Order had.   Ever heard of the Templar Empire? The Templars were far more than soldiers, in fact knights and men-at-arms were a small fraction of the Order. The rest were monks that tended the Orders massive amount of land and property. They tended farms, vineyards, they were blacksmiths and engineers, had a huge navy and most importantly, they were bankers. They controlled the money.   So I can see it following the example of the Teutonic Order (my favorite order) and destroy the middle man and take control of its territory."
HistoryWhatIf,39nglf,corruptrevolutionary,3,Sat Jun 13 05:31:16 2015 UTC,"Go on. What territory do you think they'd control? Areas in the Levant, Anatolia, the Balkans? A huge contiguous area in Europe, like the Teutonic knights? Various small Mediterranean islands, like the Knights of St. John?  How wealthy/successful do you think they'd be? How long do you think they'd last?  Until getting put down by Muslim states? Other Christian kingdoms? Christian kingdoms teaming up with Muslim states? Until the Ottomans take over?"
HistoryWhatIf,39nglf,Caiur,3,Sat Jun 13 06:55:06 2015 UTC,"So by the time we get to the Templar heresy, the holy land was already lost so Muslims wouldn't really be a part of the struggle.   ""King Philip had other reasons to mistrust the Templars, as the organization had declared its desire to form its own state, similar to how the Teutonic Knights had founded Prussia. The Templars' preferred location for this was in the Languedoc of southeastern France, but they had also made a plan for the island of Cyprus.""   So I'd imagine that southeastern France would become the core of the Templar State.   This would create France as the main enemy but unlike the Teutonic Order, they'd be fighting fellow Christians.   The Templars would remain in control of their other lands and property but wouldn't make any moves for complete self control. As kings wouldn't be comfortable and could ally against them.  Constant fighting would isolate all their territories, Grand Masters would be appointed for each one, splitting the order.   As time goes by, less and less troops and funds come from their outer lands to southern France, eventually the Templar state falls and is absorbed."

The Gestapo would arrest many, and a fair number would be assassinated.   However, let's say Stauffenberg immediately noticed the failure of the assassination attempt. He manages to escape the Wolf's Lair and makes it back to Berlin. Where he meets with other conspirators he tells them that the plot has failed. They decide that the coup cannot work, and immediately prepare to flee. Stauffenberg, Olbricht, and Haeften manage to flee to Switzerland. Where they are met with other members of the July plot.

In winter in Siberia?  Russia puts a token force out east that slows the Japanese advance. It doesn't have to stop Japan, just slow it down long enough for them to rip up the single set of tracks over the 5,000km from Vladivostok to Novosibirsk and the territory becomes absolutely useless and impassable. 5000km of impassable with the resources the Russians need to slow the advance getting easier to get to the front every day and the one the Japanese need getting harder and harder to get every day. The Japanese advance takes years for absolutely no return since the first civilization starts about Novosibirsk. Even if the Japanese stop well before Novosibirsk, say just a few hundred miles inland from Vladivostok they have gained nothing. The Pacific Coast is utterly useless to Russia's war effort against Germany.  Meanwhile the Chinese back door any Japanese advance in Siberia cutting its supply lines so the army withers. If the Japanese advance they spend a lot of oil in the process, using many gallons of fuel to deliver just 1 gallon to the slowly moving front. Its a massive drain of resources with no return.  By not attacking Pearl Harbor the Japanese also can't attack the American defend Philippines without bringing America into the war immediately. The Japanese have two choices; seize the Dutch, British and French territories and hope America doesn't declare war on them (which it absolutely will)  or watch their economy collapse from lack of resources because those countries are embargoing Japan, namely the oil it needs to drive its armies in China and across Russia. Obviously they won't choose to have their economy collapse. So instead the attack those other countries. America doesn't declare war immediately, it spends several months preparing and beefing up the defenses of the Philippines. The Philippines sits right along the major trade route from the resources Japan has just seized to the home islands. By giving the Americans time to prepare the Japanese ensure the Philippines won't be taken, or at least without another massive expenditure of resources they don't have, and that the Americans cut off those very resources Japan needs from the Philippines as long as they hold the islands. So Japan has made it harder for itself to supply its own war effort, added another front draining resources with no return, is still in a war with the Allies, and has left the American fleet intact to further interdict that trade that fleet is now alert to Japanese attacks so it can defend itself rather than waiting unaware in port. Japan loses its part of the war sooner with no impact on the European war.   IRL The Japanese didn't attack Pearl Harbor because of its strategic location or a hatred for America it did so to destroy the American fleet in a long term strategy to protect its economy. The Japanese had to take the Philippines to protect its trade, taking the Philippines brings America into war, bringing America into the war brings the American fleet into the war, better to destroy that fleet early when its unprepared then later when it is ready to fight. And maybe if the Japanese are lucky the blow will cause America to negotiate rather than fight.   Meanwhile in Russia the Germans are in Moscow. Moscow becomes this timelines Stalingrad. Every house is fought over, every room, every basement. All winter long. Stalin refuses to retreat or surrender. Hitler orders the same. A war of attrition starts in the streets of Moscow that can only favor the numbers of the Soviets. Outside of Moscow the Russians are building a massive force encircling the army in the city just like Stalingrad. It all plays out much the same, just in a different city. The Germans are at the end of their rope, they are far into Russia at the end of long supply lines, they are losing veteran troops to Russian numbers and those Russian numbers are climbing all the time.  Hitler's personal involvement doesn't allow his generals to pull back those troops and use them in the most effective manner. The Germans don't have high quality troops to hold the whole front those are needed for the offensives are tied up in city fighting because of Hitler. The Germans rely on Romanian and Italian troops to hold the front outside the city which is what the Russians target. Those troops are no better quality than the Russian ones, and much fewer in number. Eventually the Russians surround the city, the German army is cut off, Hitler refuses to let it break out, that would be retreat. An attempt is made to reconnect with them but fails. It eventually surrenders, Guderian goes to a POW camp in Siberia, most his men die in Moscow or on the way to the POW camp. The Russians slowly push the Germans back across the Eastern Front. Nothing is much different. Once the Russians are done with the Germans they turn millions of men on the Japanese, if they are still in the war and retake their Far Eastern territories."

I seriously doubt that even if the Germans would not surround the town but attack it directly, the Soviets would be able to put up the same level of resistance as in Stalingrad, especially without the fresh troops from the far East. Their army really was in tatters after the disastrous string of defeats during the summer. Plus the Germans would still be able to push South next spring, where Russian lines would be even more under equipped due to the meat grinder up north, which would probably enable Fall Blau to achieve all it's goals.

HistoryWhatIf,39kzy8,Pwnzerfaust,3,Fri Jun 12 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"The German advance into Russia was stalled by the first snows in October 1941. Guderian was already noting that his tanks were not being replaced and there were fuel shortages. Operation Typhoon traps 4 Soviet armies west of Moscow by taking Vyzama on Oct. 10. It takes 28 German divisions to reduce them but more importantly it takes time. The first snow fell on Oct 7, and as it melts and turns the land into mud. Movement is slowed until everything freezes. At the same time they reach the Mozhaisk line west of Moscow, Zhukov is placed in command of the defense of Moscow and Far East troops are already in motion to the West. Stalin is still in Moscow. Civilians are pressed into service building defenses and factories are converted to war production. Guderian (he is the focus of the OP so I'm going to ignore earlier closer advances and say they are repulsed by the Soviets), arrives in Tula at Oct 26. He has been slowed by bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges not Soviet defenses the Mozhaisk doesn't go that far south. IRL he failed to take Tula on the 29th, we will say he does. Tula is still 120 miles from Moscow.    By late October, the German forces were worn out, with only ⅓ of their motor vehicles still functioning, infantry divisions at ⅓ to ½ strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender to the idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.   Operations are halted from Oct 31-Nov 15 because of the mud. Stalin has a parade on Nov 7 and 100,000 Soviet troops reinforce Tula. The ground does not freeze until Nov 15. At that point the Germans press on. German forces get within 12 miles of Moscow to the north but again we are giving the capture to Guderian in the south.  German advances in the Tula area are 3.1–6.2 mi/day. There are no strong Russian defenses slowing him down, its the terrain, weather and his own logistics problems. At the best when Guderian starts again on Nov 18 its 19 days before he can reach Moscow at that rate. Rather than being held up by Russian forces he arrives at Moscow on Dec. 6. The temperature during the last week is -38F.    More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease had to be removed from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use. The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.   Guderian arrives in Moscow on Dec. 6th, rather than halting on the 5th as IRL but with a shattered army, understrength, freezing, out of gas, getting no replacements. The Red Army by contrast had accumulated a 58 division reserve by early December bringing 18 divisions  1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East.    There is no reason for the Russians to abandon Moscow at this point. The Germans are in no shape to push them out or away. The Russians will fight room to room. Doing so negates one of the German advantages, mobility. It also helps to negate another German advantage air support. The Luftwaffe was paralysed in the second half of December with temps as low as -44 F.  IRL the Russians pushed the Germans back 200 miles during this time, from 5 miles outside Moscow. Instead they will use the reserves to pour troops into Moscow and keep a single supply line open to those troops.   When the Japanese attack the Soviet Far East without warning on Dec. 7 1941 the Battle of Moscow is underway. Most of the Soviet Far East troops are already engaged against the Germans and the Soviets have little choice but to employ the time honored Russian strategy of give the enemy all the land he wants to hang himself on across Siberia. They put just enough troops in the way to give them time to destroy the infrastructure the Japanese might use.  If Guderian instead of entering Moscow tries to encircle and put it under siege, remember than Leningrad holds out for 900 days under a similar siege with a single supply line over Lake Lagoda. The German army is in no shape in Dec 1941 to make tremendous gains and seal Moscow off completely. That might happen in spring or Soviet counteroffensives might break what siege there is. Either way by Jan. both sides are exhausted and major movements wait for spring. Moscow or at least its outskirts remain a battle ground. The Russians likely still hold at least half of Moscow when spring comes and there is no reason to believe they will evacuate it or surrender it even if encircled. They didn't do so with Leningrad, they didn't do so with Stalingrad.  Spring offensives on both sides might change the situation dramatically.  But a major push by the Germans to completely cut off and reduce Moscow means they make no progress in the south. The Germans are already running out of oil. The Russians despite early failures are showing themselves to be determined not to surrender. Hitler's strategy relies on quick victorious wars, not wars of attrition. Any chance the Russians get to turn it into a long drawn out conflict favors them over the Germans and they will do so in the streets of Moscow."

From Wikipedia:   The Seljuqs were educated in the service of Muslim courts as slaves or mercenaries. The dynasty brought revival, energy, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians. According to the Seljuqs, they brought to the Muslims ""fighting spirit and fanatical aggression""  Once the Seljuks, led by Seljuk who converted to Islam, defeated the Ghaznavids in Persia they settled down and became persianized and set up the Seljuq Dynasty and Seljuk Empire which had extensive influence all around the Middle East:   Under Seljuks and the Ghaznavids the Islamic religious institutions became more organized and Sunni orthodoxy became more codified...  madrasas, formal Islamic schools that granted licensure to teach. First established under Seljuqs... The bureaucracies were staffed by graduates of the madrasas... a cultural blossom time in Western and Southern Asia. A shared culture spread from Mediterranean to the mouth of Ganges, despite political fragmentation and ethnic diversity.  I'm way out of my comfort zone here so this is just blatant wiki-skimming.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turko-Persian_tradition  The Seljuqs helped to shape the region politically, militarily, and culturally for all sorts of important things such as The Crusades and The Mongol Empire. Once their power waned (and some key figures died) rebellions and successions split the empire into several states but I assume they left the region more culturally and religiously uniform than when they arrived. I'm not sure how ""inevitable"" something like the Great Seljuk Empire was but I know too little about it to start ascribing too many things to it butterfly-effect style."

But lets assume that the USN is not up to scratch in 1903 and the Germans land their men. In 1903 the US Army was roughly 300,000 men. The Germans would have to catch the US off guard to accomplish anything of any use on the landing beaches.  Lets say that a fleet of 60 steam ships were able to sail across the English Channel and Atlantic Ocean without the US finding out. They would then land and take Boston and bombard NYC...then what? The US has just been invaded, they are not going to give in because teh enemy took Boston then blew up some building in NYC, the Army did that during the Draft Riots, it wont do much. That, also compounded with the fact the entire US Navy in the Atlantic and probably the Pacific will be coming for them to block off their sea support and supply lines. Those supply lines would have to cross the Atlantic Ocean and English Channel (3,000 mi+).  It would be idiotic to think the Kreigsmarine would be able to escort the entire East Coast and the Atlantic Ocean at the same time.   On the ground the situation is no better. The German Army, no matter how well trained, will be swamped with supply shortages maybe a month in, depending on how long they hold out. They also will be forced to expand out of the beachhead to secure more supplies and because they are at war! At the same time the US Army (in the midst of a series of reforms) would be kicking into high gear to stall the Germans while mobilization happens across the Nation.   On the home front resistance organization's will spring up. The US industry will begin to lurch into full swing, hitting that about the time they did in WW1. The Germans would not be able to take much out of Boston. Whoever is not killed in the fighting will be forced to surrender, at least 50k if even half surrender. At that time that is 1/5 of it. The US will then bring Germany to the table after the US Navy undergoes a massive building project.   TL;DR: If Germany will to land in Boston in 1903, it will be the death of the German Army."

Sure, the US had just came out of the Spanish American war, and were a bit stronger, the US army still wasn't capable of amassing their entire army on the eastern coast in time to stop a German invasion.  I'm sure you're counting all the reserve and National Guard units with the regular army. Plus, in 1903, the Springfield had just came out and very few would have been available to troops. The Norwegian Krag Jorgensen would have been the main battle rifle as it was against Spain. The US soldiers had quite a hard time with Spanish soldiers with mausers.   The Germans could also sway Mexico to join the war. This would really strain the US military at the time. Militias and Reserves would definitely be called up. Either way, the US would have about a week from the German embarkation to their landings to prepare a defense if the British notified them of the force. If they did mobilize and Mexico invades, it's going to put the standing US military at a bit of a strain."

HistoryWhatIf,39gfnb,RandomFlotsam,19,Thu Jun 11 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"Why would Japan attack Pearl Harbor in 1941?  The US and Germany and the Soviet Union were backing China up until 1941.    Germany had also an agreement to aid/support Japan against the Soviet Union since 1938.    The fact that everyone was allied/opposed to everyone else is an interesting bit of history that seems to get lost in the whole ""good guy, bad guy"" narrative that seems to be commonly purveyed.  Everyone was looking for resources and help, and war makes for strange bedfellows.    I think that if China could have provided raw materials in the quantity that Germany needed them, and if Germany could have helped China industrialize even faster than it did, then China might have been Germany's ally of choice against the Soviet Union.  Imagine a Chinese army, as organized as the Wehrmacht, fighting and resisting Japan.  Heck, if China weren't weak in the 1930's Japan never would have invaded them, and probably gone for other opportunities while trying to build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.  That might have meant war between Japan and the US earlier.  Likewise a strong China allied with Germany would have meant a two-front war on the Soviet Union's part.  That would have been a mess for them.  Fascism seems to me to fit in more with the historical China than communism does, as far as a economic/social order.  A fully industrialized and mobilized China in the 1930's and 1940's would have been terrifying.  I'd also imagine that Britain would have had to fight a land war from the India side of things.  That would also be a horrifying prospect for the British.  Congrats OP! you just took the Second World War and made it so much worse than it otherwise was!"
HistoryWhatIf,39gfnb,RandomFlotsam,4,Thu Jun 11 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"In fact, the more I think about it, the more a China-Germany alliance makes for interesting alliances on the other side of things.  Japan and the US would probably find themselves being allies.  Japan comes to the US in the early 1930's as their economy is tanking, and says something like:  Hey we've got this giant of a country next door to us, and they are building themselves a big army, lots of factories and all that.  You need a civilized ally on the other side of the Pacific.  We will forgive you for your arrogance with the whole Commodore Perry thing in the 1850's.  You gotta back us up against this huge nation!    And the US could see some utility in the arrangement as well.    Same thing for the British - the Japanese modeled their reformed society around the British - they even took driving on the left side of the road from the British because the British Empire was the strongest at the time.  Being a bit more pragmatic about things, and remembering that China was their traditional adversary, Japan might have realized the need for a great network of allies and could have successfully courted both Britain and the US.  That would make for a very different WW2.  I'd imagine that instead of going west against France, Germany would leave avenging WW1 for later, and get to taking out the Soviet Union right away.    Co-coordinating with China, a massive two-front blitzkrieg/閃電戰 operation against the Soviet Union.  Britain, France, Japan and the US would probably sit back and let them both take territory from the Soviets.    Now, if Germany and or China get greedy and don't stop and consolidate their new holdings and wait a generation, and instead turn and attack other neighbors, then WW2 becomes a much more terrible thing.  Two huge land powers in Asia, surrounded on all sides, but with plenty of resources and industrial might.  Sure they have to expend some resources against the Soviet guerrillas still fighting on, but systematic ethnic cleansing will eventually take care of any and all Russian resistance fighters.  In the Pacific, it's Japan and Britain (with the aid of US petroleum and lend/lease) against China; in Europe it's France (still a full country) and Britain (with US financing and lend/lease) against Germany.  (not sure what Italy does, haven't thought about it.)  It would be interesting, to see if the British and French generals could learn from the German tactics they saw being used against the Soviets a few years earlier.

Nazi Germany - having gotten all of eastern Europe and maybe even beyond, depending on their deal with China, under it's control could have defeated the wester allied forces much easier, maybe even conquering the British isles itself, making US support much harder.

With that caveat out there, here we go.   early 1919 the German Monarchy crumbles as the French and British gain a major break through and their armies break through into Germany for the first time in the war. A new military government manages to rally a last ditch defense which stops the advance and exhausts both sides. The French and British face major civil disruptions at home and an uneasy peace is reached.  In early 1920 a Status Quo peace is signed in Amsterdam, a neutral site. The Ottoman Empire crumbles as many ethnic groups grow tired of Turkish racial nationalism and the Brits are only all too eager to gain ports and alliances. They don't get to carve things up but they do get to fund their chosen associates.   The German Military government lasts only a few months before they decide to call for general elections, the massive protests against war time rationing and taxes might have encouraged them and the massive desertions due to lack of supplies sealed the deal.   The French economy is devastated and in the next election cycle they elect full blown Marxists to power.   England goes the other way, cutting back on European affairs and work on their expanding empire. Germany still has a fleet that can be a bother (no victory, so no sinking at Skapa Flow)  Russia becomes the Soviet Union, but the white army crumbles much faster without the outside support from everyone else. Lenin still has his stroke, Stalin still seizes power, and he does his 5 year plans and industrializes.   The USA, having stayed out, Elects James Cox seeing as how President Wilson did not create the League of Nations or give the Republicans something to nail him to the wall with during the War.   President Cox handles the 1920 post war recession reasonably well and is re-elected in 1924. He does what old time Democrats did, he lowered tariffs and worked more with progressive issues than Harding/Coolidge did. In 1928 Frank Lowden (republican) Beats Franklin Roosevelt for the office and has an uneventful two terms.   There is no great depression in the 1930s because of a number of issues. The treaty of Versailles in our time line, combined with other instigations encouraged American investors and bankers to loan Germany lots and lots of money, and this caused the US Federal Reserve to try and slow this, along with changes in farm prices due to mechanization, and tariff battles were the major causes of the Depression. But none of this happens.   Germany comes out of the war without huge costs, in fact, no one is heavily fined for the war, so investment into European reconstruction ends by 1924 and the Europeans are back on their feet again. In the late 1920s the French vote out most of the Marxists for other Socialists and the Germans are voting middle of the road for their guys.   Stalin is looking to get his land back, but no one wants war, so through the 1930s he ""annexes"" various places, only Finland and Poland are able to hold him off.   By the mid 1940s the European Colonial empires are having trouble since the colonials want to be left on their own. German Colonies go first, followed by French and Italian colonies. Great Britain lets India go in 1945 and the rest of Africa through the 1960s.   Japan and China fought a regional war in the 1930s which by the early 1940s caught the United States up in. The United States by 1944 had begun the process of invading Japan when Japan sued for peace and the US agreed. by 1947 Japan had agree to liberate Manchuria and Korea and acknowledge China's territorial integrity.  China fought a Civil War, but with the help of American forces the Nationalists survived. They went through a series of strongman presidents before a stable political system emerged in the 1970s."
HistoryWhatIf,39h945,BSebor,9,Thu Jun 11 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"Julian was actually a fairly shrewd governor. For instance, when he was placed in control of the western empire he not only was able to overcome great difficulties in order to be able to expel the barbaric invaders taking over the region, but he also reformed tax codes in such a way to simultaneously lighten the burden on most citizens of the empire, while at the same time increasing tax revenue.   So, his 5 years as Caesar showed he had the chops militarily, economically and politically to carve out a base of power and rule effectively despite difficult situations and animosity from both military and political power blocs.   If he would have been able to come back from Persia and be Augustus for four decades , I think he had the leadership ability to fulfill many of his ambitions. I believe he would have used his tax code reforms to create a devotion of himself amongst the common citizens, and would have made sure that the military was on his side. With those two factors acting as the basis of his power bloc, he could have moved on the more powerful Romans and the Christian church.   His religion reform policy was not one of persecution of Christians, but rather of not supporting the church and creating policies that de-incentivize being a christian. If those policies would have been allowed to grow for four decades, and, all the while, he would have been ably running the empire into a more cohesive and healthy entity, by the end of his reign I think he would have successfully reversed course on the rise of Christianity in Europe. Christianity would still exist, but to a much less degree -- with a similar presence as it has in areas like Egypt, Syria, etc.   All empires fall, and even a neo-pagan more philisophical Rome would be no exception -- but, much like the dynamic Roman emperors before Julian, who were able to breathe new life into an empire that seemed almost to be ready to dissolve causing it to last several extra generations, I think Julian's reforms and able leadership would have given the Empire another 100 - 200 years (I'm spit-balling here though of course). I believe he would have created a reformed tax code and a less drastic east-west divide, and those, by themselves, would have made the empire much healthier in the long run."

One of the things Julian did to weaken Christianity was to sow discord into Christian communities by recalling nonconformist  bishops who are theologically at odds with their diocese. This may result in more variety in Christianity, but it does not kill it. Paganism may remain popular amongst the aristocracy, but Julian's reforms of the religion fail to take root.   It's important to remember that nobody really liked Julian. Traditional pagans found his insistence on charity unusual and lacked the infrastructure to compete with Christianity on this level, while Christians were offended by Julian's attack on their religion. These are the reasons for his desaterous invasion of Mesopotamia.   The Roman Empire still falls."

The influx of wealth would have more than offset the cost of the invasion and spark a big (but relatively short-lived) economic boom in the Empire.   On the religious front, it's possible that the Empire would split as it did in the OTL except with a Christian east in Constantinople and and pagan west in Rome. If cooler heads prevail, there would be an agreement of religious tolerance, though proselytizing would likely be forbidden.   The Western Empire would fall eventually, maybe in the late 500's or early 600's. The tidal wave of German tribes were simply going to prevail over time. In the end, they would have imposed their own brand of Christianity in Western Europe. If a pagan kingdom does manage to survive in Iberia or North Africa, it would be swallowed up by the Moslem Conquests. Roman Paganism would live on as a minority religion in in the East which is more religiously tolerant in this timeline."

Instead of being pushed out by the reconquista, it goes the other way as Christianity is pushed back across the Pyrenees all the way into France. Spain never ""discovers"" the New World.  Muslim Moors colonize Central and South America instead.  Meanwhile, back in Europe, Constantinople has fallen to the Turks. The Ottomans push steadily westward until they reach Vienna and it falls too. Europe is caught in a pincer movement of Islam as it steadily encroaches northward up through France and along the Atlantic coast. It also comes in from the east through Austria and all the little divided German speaking states.  By the 1800's, the only remaining areas with a strong Christian presence are the British Isles and Scandinavia. The English managed to start a few small colonies in North America. But here too, things haven't gone as well. Moorish colonists from Central America, having a 200 year head start, have moved up through Mexico and established thriving colonies all over the Mississippi river basin in the American heartland. The English colonies on the Atlantic coast never have a chance against the expanding inland empire of the Moors.  In this timeline, the same natural wealth and geographic factors that made America  the world's richest and most powerful nation are now in the hands of the Empire of Moorland. Islam is far and away the dominant religion of North and South America as well as the Middle East and most of Europe. Orthodox Christianity still survives in the Russian Empire even after several attempts by Islamic Europe to bring the faith to the Russian infidels.   Science has advanced under Islam quite nicely. The Greek and Roman knowledge preserved by Islamic scholars has resulted in a 20th century level of technology by the early 1800's. WJI (word jihad one) is fought with primitive self propelled vehicles and early aircraft. After WJII, the first nuclear weapons are built.   In 1863, Europe and the Moorish Empire of North America demand that the rest of the world (Russians, Chinese and India) submit to Islam or face annihilation. When they refuse WJIII begins. By the 1880's, the world's population (which was just over one billion people) has fallen to less than 800 million. Most of the survivors in Russia, China and India have converted and the world is now over 95% Muslim."

The Reconquista doesn't happen and it's Muslim explorers who sail to the Americas and spread their religion.   More conquests/conversions in Africa wouldn't hurt. In addition to Mali, maybe Ethiopia ends up adopting Islam one way or another. Muslim traders and missionaries routinely round the Cape of Good Hope, spreading the faith as they go.   With no European imperialism, the Mugal Empire lasts much longer in India and Hinduism becomes a religious minority. They might have even conquered or converted Indo-China.

Another Irish rebellion might come up with French backing in the aftermath of the war, but, like the others, it would be crushed by the still-formidable British military.

As to reducing travel to the west coast because of a good economy, I highly doubt it. A lot of the reason for the many bank panics and recessions of the era was the lack of a central bank after Jackson vetoed the 2nd bank's charter. So unless your PoD is Jackson signs the charter, I really don't see how the economy does well nationwide. And even if I grant a miraculously booming economy, the era before the expiration of the bank's charter still saw people move west. The Midwest, but still west of the rest of the country. I have no reason to think that the temptation of gold in California, mixed with its amazing growing climate and extremely productive land would not be settled in droves even with a good economy."

I chose this because we know how increased government spending whether on infrastructure or war (which requires it's own infrastructure), as we saw in the turn-around of the Great Depression.  Roosevelt's New Deal wasn't terribly aggressive but it did get the economy back on track until 1937 when many economists feel the 1937 recession was caused by premature curtailing of government spending, but then preparations for WW2 started. I'm assuming that the Whig's American System was more aggressive than the New Deal, though not as much as gearing up to supply those arming for war, and thus is more than sufficient to handle at least everything until the Panic of 1857.  The Americans who went to the California Gold Rush were of three kinds: business people who went to start new business to service the growing California population. the down-and-outers with nothing to lose, and the fortune seekers. Everything I have read about the CGR is that the down-and-outers were the largest group, followed by the fortune seekers. In good economic times there will be, obviously, less down-and-outers. Of the fortune seekers, only the true risk takers will leave the safety of a strong economy, and the same thing can be said for business people.  Therefore, reduction in American migration to Alta California is not an unreasonable effect. Rather it becomes just a part of the international migration to the Pacific West Coast."

Many of whom would have been forced to move north for industrial jobs or out west for good growing lands and/or gold in California (which also has Nevada and Colorado's silver). All this despite the good overall economy, because the only way to increase profit for planters would have been to expand plantations or open new ones in Texas, which isn't unlikely, but since Texas' economy was unstable due to the inability to effectively back a currency and its tremendous debts, it's also a high risk investment.

Now certainly many would try to buy small plots of land in Texas, and a lucky few would be able to turn it into a successful large plantation, but the parts of Texas most amenable to cotton growing (by far the most profitable plantation crop of the time) are all in East Texas. And you need a lot of land to make cotton farming worth it, now Texas could enact a homesteading law that would give land to white Americans for cheap, but that would be short sighted since Texas was using its land wealth to back up its currency. If it privatises too much land, its currency becomes worthless. So the barrier for entry to the elite planter class just went up, not down upon crossing the Sabine. Doubtless, there will still be lot of plantations in Texas, just owned by absentee landlords from the US and managed by white Texans and/or southerners who moved to Texas. So yeah, lots of southern small folk would move to Texas, but it wouldn't turn out great for them, meaning that they either bust and move back to the US, continue westward, or remain poor Texans. But that's just East Texas where the climate is most like the rest of the South.  By the time you get to Central Texas and the hill country, cotton growing gives way to cattle ranching which can't really use slaves as moving cattle to market would provide opportunity for escape. Not to mention driving the cattle until Texas could build railroads would be unpopular because to get to Texas' one good port system at Houston/Galveston would have you trying to navigate between dozens of different plantations all of whom are trying to keep the cattle from marching through their plantations and destroying profits. Building rail would also be costly because it too would take up land useful for cotton growing and would be fought by the planter class, and until the railroads are built settling West Texas (OTL Panhandle and Big Bend) is a pipe dream, as it's too far from Houston or Austin for Texas to enforce its power there. (OTL the Buffalo Soldier is who won the Indian Wars in West Texas.) Hell, most of the counties in modern West Texas weren't created until after the Civil War, and this larger West Texas has half of New Mexico and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. And New Mexico is likely to revolt because they don't want to be part of Texas, let's not forget that Santa Fe is the oldest capital city in the USA and at the time was Spanish speaking and Catholic. So if Texas can incorporate or get rid of the native Americans -which will take decades-, then and only then would land beyond the Hill Country be ""safe"" for white settlement. Until that point, poor southerners are stuck with East and Central Texas, in one part getting a plantation will be phenomenally expensive due to the quality of the land, and in the other ranching is king and not only is slavery inefficient and risky, the amount of money it would take to buy adequate amounts of land and cattle as well as employ the people to drive the cattle to market would put it out of reach of most poor white southerners."

Syphilis has a relatively short latency stage and the symptoms were fairly consistent and yet it was still a significant problem in some parts of the world until people figured out antibiotics.      Also, while sharing needles was not an issue 200 years ago, I am certain that universal precautions to avoid body fluids was not something that many people were conscious of.

Medical science was in its infancy. It took doctors/scientists years to figure out what hiv/aids was in the 80s. Centuries ago they would have had little ability to do the same. I bet they would have thought that there were various different types of ailments and would have taken a long time to figure out it was caused by sex. Much like syphillis.  4.

And as others have pointed out, it's very unlikely that anyone would even make the connection between non-monogamous sex and the wide variety of symptoms showing up years afterwards.   Particularly since sex is only one transmission route.  No needles, but were they really careful about contact with other bodily fluids?  Once the barber/doctor gets infected, your town is pretty much hosed.  (I'm imagining Sweeney Todd carving his way through London with HIV-stained straight razors.

I think it's fair to presume that Finland would get the same treatment as the Baltic states. After the occupation of Finland, there would be armed insurgency many years after the conquest of Finland: after the Continuation War in our timeline, large number of weapons were cached for fear of Soviet occupation. They hid enough weapons for 35000 men to resist the occupation. Of course, the Soviets would brutally suppress it, as they did in Baltic States (1944-1953), East Germany (1953), Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968).  Otto Wille Kuusinen was the president of Terijoki government during Winter War and he was supposed to be the leader of Finland if Finland was conquered during Winter War. It's likely that Kuusinen would be the leader of Finnish SSR. All parties would be forbidden to operate, except the communist party (duh).  Expulsion of ~10 % Finnish people to Russia or other SSR republics would happen. They would be replaced by people from Baltic states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Sweden-Finns would probably by expelled or put to prison camps, and the official 2nd language status of Swedish would be replaced with Russian. Churches would be demolished or changed to movie theatres or similar.  Finland's borders would be different. Since it would be completely USSR controlled, there's no reason to not include Karelia - it will be under USSR influence no matter what. The new borders were drawn during Winter War, and the map was declassified recently: take a look. The border is drawn several hundred kilometers to the east, with the exception of the Karelian Isthmus, to secure Leningrad (St. Petersburg today).  Finland would be part of Warsaw pact and have a load of Soviet military bases facing Norway in north and Åland islands would be militarized, as they provide a naval base to control the Baltic sea. It is quite certain that Sweden would join NATO and it would have a strong desire to save Åland from occupation, since it is predominantly Swedish-speaking territory. They already had a crisis about it in 1920s, which League of Nations resolved for the benefit of Finland. Maybe Swedish would occupy it before the Soviets could?  However, annexing Finland would not stop USSR from collapsing, so in 1991 Finland would declare independence as a larger nation than today.

Still, the final piece before it turned into a fireball was 1000 kilos. It's not one of those heavy-iron killers but that's respectable. A piece they fished out of the bottom of the lake is reportedly half that mass and 5ft across. So assuming big rocks hitting icy lakes scales linearly.  But maybe that's unfair. The airblast has been reported as something like 500 kilotons of TNT in light, heat, and shockwave. The energy that would have been released in the explosion should be, at least partially, transferred to the impact. Not just the added mass. Still, probably a lot fewer people would have been admitted for cuts."

The United States has no interest in invading or occupying Pakistan, and never has had such an interest. It would not advance our interests in combating terrorism, and would likely increase our risk of terror attacks as the whole Islamic world (with some justification) turned against the U.S., and it would be enormously costly in terms of lives and money.  Pakistan is an ally of the U.S. in the war on terror; but like most things related to that area of the world, the situation is complex.  First, Afghan jihadis take refuge in Pakistan because the Afghan army can't just cross the border on a whim to pursue them, or bomb their hideouts, not because Pakistan welcomes them or supports them. The Pakistani/Afghan border is an enormous expanse of mountainous, mostly wilderness land to police as a border.  With all the U.S. money and technology spent on the problem, we can't effectively secure our own border with Mexico against people crossing illegally. (I am not taking a stance on illegal immigration to the U.S. one way or the other, just making note that securing a long rural border is very difficult even for a rich country like the United States.)  Second, the areas of Pakistan where the Afghan jihadis escape are a people ethnically, linguistically, and culturally very similar. Remember that the national borders in that part of the world were somewhat arbitrarily drawn by former colonial powers; they do not really mark a historic separation of peoples.  Finally, Pakistan itself has a complex history with Afghan jihadis. In the 1980's, during Soviet occupation, Pakistan's military intelligence agency, the ISI, was the conduit through which U.S. aid to the Afghan ""freedom fighters"" were funneled, so the ISI has a relationship with these groups, or at least their predecessors that goes back a long way. People have somewhat reasonably speculated that some factions in the Pakistani government and military avoid agitating the jihadis too much, with the hope they will confine their fight to the other side of the border in Afghanistan. That's not in any way proven, however, and even if it was, dropping bombs on any part of Pakistan wouldn't do anything but insure rage and hostility again the U.S.  Also to your point of the U.S. invading and occupying Pakistan -- look at how the U.S. occupation of Iraq turned out, and Pakistan is a far more populous and larger country than Iraq, with over 180 million people and 307,374 sq mi compared to Iraq's 36 million people and 169,234 sq mi -- twice the area, 5x the population. The Soviets couldn't even fully pacify Afghanistan, which is far less populous and smaller, despite having a very large and modern military and using quite brutal methods. ""Military quagmire"" wouldn't even begin to describe it - Vietnam and Iraq rolled together wouldn't even scratch the amount of violence and destruction that would result.  From a geopolitical strategy perspective, the Pakistani nuclear weapons program isn't designed to deter the United States; it exists to deter India, their arch-rival in the region with whom they have fought several wars in the last half-century. India also has tested nuclear devices. Pakistan doesn't really have a means of delivering a crippling nuclear strike on the United States (they don't have ICBM's or bombers that could get through).  TL;DR: 1. The U.S. is allied with Pakistan, not against. 2. Sealing a long border in a rugged mountainous wilderness area is really hard 3. Occupying Pakistan would be a massive, bloody and expensive mess ending in immense loss of life on both sides and ultimate failure, should we even want to do so. 4. If the U.S. decided for some improbable or insane reason they had to attack Pakistan, Pakistan's nukes wouldn't really deter them."

There will always be a sanctuary area. America might occupy that too and the sanctuary simply moves somewhere else. The situation with ISIS/ISIL/DAESH demonstrates this: fighters moved fluidly between Iraq and Syria - making bases wherever looked safest and attacking in whichever country there was an opportunity.   Advantage insurgents: they don't have to care about borders as much as governments do. If you start a war with Syria to go after them they will just move somewhere else.

They supported the Taliban from its begging in the '90s and to the present day. They did this to make Afghanistan an ally/puppet and to use the different groups operating in there as a training ground to use against India in Kashmir.   I believe that OBL was kept in his compound as the ISI (equivalent of Pakistani CIA) was going to his him as a bargaining chip at some point. He was out of contact with the rest of his organisation, and was little more then a figure head.  Nuclear weapons were not the only thing stopping the US from invading. First of all they did not really have the manpower to do so after the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Though it could be possible if they never invaded Iraq.  The large population was a factor. Iraq and Afghanistan have a combined population of 60 million, Pakistan has a population of 200 million. Trying to occupy a country with a population of almost two-thirds of the US would have been a much harder fight. Afghanistan would have seemed like a walk in the park by comparison.  Pakistan is in the unique position of being allies with both the US and China. If the US invaded they would be without any allies in the region, and China's influence would grow. It might even be likely that China begins to smuggling weapons into Pakistan.  The UK would not support this invasion. The UK gave quite a large part of its military for the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. However  the majority of the Muslim population has origins in Pakistan and Kashmir. The Labour governments (1997-2010) relied on votes from urban areas, most of which Muslim voters are. They would not risk their electron chances, and a potential violence within the UK.   In the long run there would only be less violence in the Middle East if the Iraq invasion does not go ahead. However Southern Asia would become much less stable."

The problem is the Saudis, they export their form of Islam to the rest of the extended middle east causing the population to become radicalized.   It would be almost impossible to occupy 200 million people with direct access to guns and high gun owning ratio. Afghanistan would likely be more stable when the terrorist wouldn't have a place to run to. Pakistan would stop sending terrorists to India for fear of retaliation. Extremist ideology would need to fought via closing down of madrassas. I don't think Pakistan is a direct threat to the middle east. They are a threat to India, Afghanistan and the West. Any action that stops the nuclear blackmail will likely lower their threat level."

In classical Rome, the legions were not only soldiers but also engineers and construction workers.   B should funnel as much cash as prudent into the army, then use those troops in repairing key infrastructure and put down possible up risings.  The alps are a natural barrier, to protect from further invasions, the mountain passes would be heavily fortified.   Constantinople would benefit from trade but also an ally in the west."
HistoryWhatIf,3970xi,corruptrevolutionary,3,Wed Jun 10 04:06:54 2015 UTC,"okay, I'm inclined to agree with you  549-550 Belisarius first act as Augustus is to provide lands in Northern Italy, Africa and Iberia to his successful veterans. This causes the veterans to eagerly support Belisarius and secures his northern border from invasion. He then disperses Narses' remaining mercenary contingents throughout the conquered lands, 1) to prevent mutiny and 2) to secure the alps and lands that are at the highest risk of foreign invasion.  Second, Belisarius secures the cooperation of the Senate via liberal distribution of land throughout Italia and North Africa. He charges them with preserving and restoring the infrastructure of Italia, as well as any municipal affairs that he requires assistance with. He sends a number of them to reorganise North Africa and preserve the rich agricultural lands needed to support Italia.   He lacks the tax resources to initiate a reform of the Latin legions. Seeking aid he requests that Justinian send Byzantine military advisors and a loan of sorts to kick start the recruitment. In the style of Marius, Belisarius seeks the aid of the landless plebeians/peasants. Who eagerly join the newly formed contigents. It is slow at first but following the gothic wars, economic necessity reinvigorates the Italians interest in warfare.   550-555 Belisarius' has slowly secured North Africa and italia. The Latin legions are as effective as their Byzantine counterparts and with a growing tax base in Italia and North Africa. Their number grows each year. The senate restoring itself has control of the government of Corsica and Sardinia, municipal affairs of Italy and the Grain supply of North Africa. The cooperation between the Senate and Belisarius has never been higher. The senate focuses public spending on infrastructure while Belisarius and his Byzantine exarchs focus on the military and religious building construction. Belisarius leads a short campaign in Iberia to preserve his holdings there. He expands to control all of the southeastern part of spain. By 555, Byzantine colonies have been established along the coast. This provides Belisarius with resources to fund Iberian legions with the capture of numerous silver mines. This wealth flows to Italia and further a field to Constantinople. Justinian benefits from the success of his colleague and is not overcome with the common feelings of resentment felt by colleagues.   559 -  Belisarius has now reestablished 'roman' control of the West. The Visigoths are cowed by their defeats in Iberia, the north of Italy is secure by fortification and the now reformed Latin legions. Justinian recalls his old general and colleague to lead a defense against the Bulgars led by Khan Zabergan. The khan is outnumbered and his army is decimated by a combined Italian-Byzantine force. While staying in Constantinople, Belisarius is accused of corruption by a former subordinate, his Judge Procopius cannot give a verdict of guilty and Belisarius never loses face in the court of Constantinople. Procopius is discredited and writes an even more venomous secret history.   559-565: The remainder of Belisarius' life is spent establishing himself as preeminent Augustus of the early medieval period. He has a cult of personality about him like the great generals of Antiquity. His reign is universally remembered as successful and numerous public works throughout Italia bear his name. He, however, despite seeking repentance for his deposition of Pope Silverius, never again gains the support of the Church of Rome. He however begins the process of appointing Byzantine patriarchs. In 564, names his successor as Tiberius - then commander of the Excubitors. This is approved by Justinian and both the Roman and Byzantine courts. Both Justinian and Belisarius die in 565. They are remembered as the restorers of the Roman world, and their administrations greatly enriched the Byzantine empire.  565 - onward: Eventually the western Augustus is absorbed and replaced by exarchs loyal to the emperor in Constantinople. The enlarged Byzantine empire has through Belisarius been reformed and provides them with massive self sustaining resources. The great Sassanian-Byzantine war is not nearly as devastating as Khosrau II cannot match the resources of the Byzantines. The rise of the caliphate is not as initially successful against a stronger, more unified state. It does however decline in the 9-10th century. The exarchates of Iberia, Italia and Africa are essentially autonomous empires who become increasingly hostile. Civil war and foreign aggression eventually undermine the Justinian-Belisarius empire much like the OTL but slower, and the Byzantines still preserve their eastern holdings and present a more even match for the increasing number of nomadic Turkic tribes."

The Spanish Crown is convinced to allow local leadership to do the bulk of the operations, so long as the silver pours in, who cares what they do over there, right?   Spanish Colonies develop local government councils but the Spanish Crown and Roman Church do step in and define the borders. Two Viceroyalities are established each one with an Arch Bishopric. One for North America, one for South America. Within these two Viceroyalites are about a dozen colonies each with it's local council of elites including land owners, merchants, and bishops. Each Viceroyality has an appointed Viceroy but the real power is in the Assembly where each colony sends a delegation of elites to represent the interests of each colony.   These two political units, grow through the early 1700s. South America fills out the land and creates a mutual boundary with Brazil and North America butts into Russian, British, and French colonial empires.   Now, Back to the 1600s. The Virginia Colony is crumbling, King James makes it a Crown Colony and disbands the assembly allowing only crown appointees to run the Colony. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Colonies are likewise dominated by the Crown, however up there local elites do manage local affairs and there is constant friction with the Crown Authorities.   Over the next century through expansion and conquest the now British Colonies stretch from Georgia in the South through Nova Scotia in the North. All are heavily dominated by the Crown and the Crown agents.   The French and Indian War (Seven Years War) erupts and The French are removed from North America. The British Empire controls everything east of the Mississippi.   Taxation goes up to fund the post war debt. The British colonists don't actually bitch, but the Mexican Colonists erupt in anger. Spain lost the war, and Mexican forces actually did a great deal of the fighting. Spain gave up a chunk of North American viceroyality (Florida) and now they demand more money out of their North American colonists. well, esto es no bueno!   in the 1760s fighting Erupts and spreads through many North American colonies, the Viceroyality is split between the Colonies around Mexico city, which face the most taxation, and the Colonies in the Isamus which are not taxed so heavily.   by the 1780 Spain gives up and the North American Viceroyality is free, A new country named Mexico, after the largest of the Colonies emerges while several other countries in Central America break away to do their own thing, not wanting to be part of Mexican affairs.   This new Mexican Federation takes much of the old Viceroyality system and put it fully under local rule.   The new country grows and flourishes, importing British ideas on industrialization and uses its abundant natural resources to become really wealthy.  The South American viceroaylity begins to rebel once they too face the boot of taxation.  By the 1790s, with the Mexican example just across the Mississippi, British Colonies begin to agitate for more Independence, after a series of massacres a thirty year guerrilla war ensues and by the 1820s the British, Exhausted pull out and focus on other issues. Other than a few sugar islands, the UK is out of North America.  The British colonies begin infighting. Each of the 20 different ex colonial nations fight over unorganized territory west of the Appalachians, water rights, borders, and trade policy. It isn't until the 1860s that New England emerges as a unified and stable region, extending from New York City up to Montreal. Eventually Virginia secures power on the Southern chunk of the colonies and New England, Virginia, and Quebec (which takes Montreal and points north) divide the former British colonial north america between themselves.   All three nations continually deal with corruption, military dictatorships, and just poor management.   The Mexican Federation came into several periods of good fortune when Gold was discovered in the 1850s in California, Silver in Nevada in the 1870s and Oil in Texas in the 1890s. In fact Mexico has been blessed with abundant mineral wealth, not to mention abundant farm land, timber resources, and good harbors.   (after this I start to get a little silly)  By the early 1900s they were the world leader in motion picture production helping to make Spanish the world's dominant language.   Mexican supply ships turned the tide in World War One and allowed the Central Powers to negotiate an amicable peace in 1917 and supplies the White Army during the Russian Civil War.   It was Mexican President Bustamonte who Negotiated the ""Lasting Peace"" between Virginia and New England in 1921 which ended the last war in North America.   In 1958 launching from Veracruze the first manned mission to the Moon began.   in 1979 Mexican University built the first Fusion reactor and by 1999 half the world's power needs were being met by clean energy."

With control of Indochina, Vietnams production and man power is significantly increased.

Then contact is made with Spanish, English, Dutch, and French, and the Algonquin ind Iroquois peoples are brought into trade networks, iron knives, pots, pans, for hides.  But those guns, this iron, is very different from what Iroquois know how to make. A few visionary leaders decide that they must control the knowledge of iron.   They raid a European trading post allied with the Algonquin and by luck find a few men who know how to smelt iron. Through Stockholm syndrome and giving of wives, these men are adopted into Iroquois culture and teach them of iron working. with in a few years the Iroquois have chain mail shirts and good iron axes and arrow tips.   The European ""Converts"" also teach them a thing or two about drilled combat, which the Iroquois adapt to their world.    A series of raids against Algonquin settlements and their European trading partners manages to net a gunsmith's apprentice who was sent out here because he was in major debt. He more willingly joins the Iroquois, after all wives are better than prisons.   The Iroquois start making basic 16th century firearms and powder, but they actually like making mines more than guns.   The Europeans not only bring metallurgy and gun-work to the Iroquois but also farm animals. the a few cattle, hogs, and chickens captured were kept for breeding and by the 1560s the Iroquois have a substantial herd.   During this time they continue to absorb a large number of Algonquin peoples who see the strength of the Iroquois as better than the wrath of the Europeans who have suffered humiliating defeats. by the 1570s the Iroquois federation is growing rapidly and manage to prevent European trade post establishment which discourages colonization of the North Eastern region of the continent.   Iron tools allow more abundant cultivation methods and populations explode with the food surpluses. The Villages have grown into small cities and the stratification of Iroquois society is expanding with artisans, farmers, warriors, and shamen all becoming more specialized.   in the 1600s the English begin to settle around Jamestown, and Massachusetts and the local indians seek to have alliances with the English against the Iroquois. After a few years of contact, however, the Powhatan and others instead turn to the Iroquois for protection against the English and in a series of bloody wars the English are pushed off of North America by the 1660s. During these wars there is no Tobacco boom, and the English give up on colonization for a while.   The English aren't all wiped out, many women are captured and traded off as wives. Some men who were fast thinkers and not too terribly devout also found survival in submission.   These women, almost all puritan, slowly begin influencing their various Indian husbands in Calvinist doctrine and attempt to convert them to monotheism, it almost never takes, but the doctrine predestination becomes rather popular, afterall, what better way to explain the victory over these white guys from across the ocean and to take their wives?   The doctrine becomes popular enough that it encourages some spreading across the land from about Virginia up to about the St Lawrence river. through the 1600s small urban centers begin to spread with artisan iron production, more europeanized farming methods, and a shamanistic religion adopting some aspects of Calvinism.   Escaped slaves from Spanish holdings in Florida also begin to join into this new expanded federation bringing in more western production skills plus a mix of Spanish, mesoamerican, and west African cultural motifs. The increase in European production knowledge includes things like ship building.   A war with Spain erupts and the Iroquois are tested against a first rate army. Because the war is fought far away from either country's heartland it is mostly skirmishes with only a few daring raids. Eventually the Spanish, unwilling to negotiate, just quit and fort up around Florida. The Iroquois learn many lessons on how europeans fight and how they think. They also begin to pick up the concept of race.  in the late 1600s a number of Iroquois trade cities have popped up along the coast and European merchants call there. The Iroquois are tied into the European trade system and trade the resources they have, like lumber, and gold from the Carolinas, for European goods.  Through the early 1700s the Iroquois artisans work to catch up and in some places exceed their European counterparts, including in gunwork. The trade back and forth actually helps to undermine European cultures in Europe as Iroquois and other native preachers will visit Europe during trade missions and speak of their religions to people who are not quite happy with how the various churches are working out. Europeans, of-course, hear all these ideas in the context of Christianity, but they begin to adopt ideas that originated in North america.   These help to fuel a growing series of upheavals in Europe in the mid 1700s as population pressures and aristocratic wars are exhausting the resources of Europe.   Already the Turks have pushed through Austria and with Western Europe in flames, stability doesn't look good.   by the late 1700s the tribes bordering the Iroquois in the Mississippi river system and in what is now the South have adopted a great deal of the Iroquois artisan urban system and are competing with the Iroquois across north America.   Because of this Competition, a group in what is now Texas sends missionaries into Spanish Mexico to rally the Mestizos to their side. A long and bloody war erupts in Spanish Mexico between the Mestizos and the Creoles. the Mestizos are supplied and openly supported by the country in what is now Texas and with the Spanish struggling to maintain in Europe they can't support their Vice Royality.   With a growing amount of pure Indian and mestizo Mexicans rallied to the side of this Texas country a ten year long war between them and Iroquois erupts which ends with a truce and a division of spheres.   This war was the first ""modern"" war for the Indians and forced a development of new weapons and tactics. It also involved naval ships and the Iroquois navy came out much stronger. Which allowed them to regain their honor by launching an Invasion of France.   The french, not happy with Spain, decided to aid the Mestizos and Texas in their war over Mexico. This aid continued into the Iroquois war so the Iroquois decided to give them a trouncing.   While being little more than raids along coastal inlets, this was really enough to destabilize France and full on civil war erupted.   The English and Spanish took advantage of the confusion and began seizing parts of France that they had long claimed, such as Anjou, Normandy, etc.   The Iroquois came back with great wealth, pride, and ambition. They invaded Ireland (not part of England anymore, they broke away in the 1600s) and actually managed to Occupy it. during the early 1800s a major conflict between the Occupation and the Irish resulted in great slaughter but eventually the Irish relented and submitted. they were allowed to keep their way of life, but had to pay taxes.   The country that is what is now texas (Sorry for not naming it) decided to pick off Spanish Island colonies and then get in on the slave trade, actually taking over a good bit of Coastal Western Africa. They managed to start a slave uprising in Brazil by not being very good at the Slave Trade and the white people of Brazil didn't last too long.   By the mid 1800s many native Americans had adopted Iroquois style urban artisan culture and everywhere, except for California, there are growing sings of urbanization. California is still too far cut off and only coastal trade reaches there.   Facing invasion from three sides (Turks, Indians, and Russians) some Pope manages to call together a crusade and rallies enough people to him that he begins systematically reunifying the old Roman Empire and Germany, over four popes, between 1830 and 1875 All of Western Europe, except England, is united under this strange Vatican Roman Empire and invasions are launched of North Africa, pushing the Muslims back, and a liberation of Eastern Europe is launched in 1890 which fails miserably. This reunification breaks apart and local governments are restored.   The short lived unity does result in an alliance against outside forces, an alliance that the English join. through the early 1900s a series of wars against the Turks does manage to liberate Egypt and Greece. Several invasions of Ireland never amount to much, the Irish seem to like the Iroquois better than the English.   Through the mid 1900s Europe and the Middle east finally stablize, while north America sees a half dozen, semi peaceful nation states. The strongest of which is the Iroquois."

HistoryWhatIf,3934bg,Historyguy81,6,Tue Jun 9 11:41:05 2015 UTC,"By first contact the Iroquois need a lot more land (All of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and a good chunk of Pennsylvania) and population. They also need to advance with a writing system and more military focus, maybe something like Alexander's 15 ft spears. As they conquer the nearby territories, assimilation shouldn't be a problem.  By the time first contact arrives, there will be many deaths and many hardships. Crops would fail, kings would die, but life would continue with the large population that the Iroquois had pre-contact. With new animals and foods, the Iroquois could bounce back within a generation or two. The Kings and tribal elders would need to adopt European technology, mainly military. Quarries, mines, and logging camps would be created, and the Iroquois would look like a 1200s era Europe.  And of course, Christianity would have had to be adopted, just to avoid the chance of a crusade. Whether the people liked it or not, but it would likely be a Polish style approach to religion, where no one really cares except for the extremists. The Iroquois might adopt a European language as well.  In the need for allies in the new world, many European nations would be kind to the sole native power, and if they were smart, it'd be a pretty neutral state with a powerful army to defend the country. If and when war breaks out, the Iroquois can easily deploy south, north, and west.   Years pass by, the Iroquois continue to survive and prosper after the plagues of first contact, by the Industrial revolution, the Confederacy slowly advances. After massive industrialization and power growth, some call for the colonization of Africa to protect the natives, and in modern day Liberia, the Iroquois establish a small colony with many freedoms. They also start to colonize barren islands like Saint Helena and Ile Bourbon.  Later on, the Iroquois start to appeal to many oppressed minorities, from other natives to Europeans. A new technological revolution starts in the Iroquois lands and they lead the industrial and technological sectors today, with a strong population and a multicultural state."
HistoryWhatIf,3934bg,Austinpike446,2,Tue Jun 9 01:11:54 2015 UTC,"Since Austinpike446 and Historyguy81 did pre-contact jumping off points, I'll do a post-contact one. In this timeline, the Iroquois win decisively in the Beaver Wars and become the dominant power in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Valley. The French are forced to go through them for the fur trade giving them better access to firearms. As England and France go at each other in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Iroquois remain neutral and have a more quid pro quo relationship with the two. This means that the French are not driven out of Quebec for the time being. They also are able to effectively deal with English squatters coming over the Appalachians.  With the ""French threat"" still in North America, the colonists are less inclined to break from England's military protection (though some calls for independence still do exist). Instead, they call for war with the Iroquois to open up more land for settlement. During the War of Austrian Succession, a force of British regulars, colonial militia and a few of their native allies march through Iroquois territory to attack Quebec. The Iroquois surround the smaller army and kill or capture the entire force. Alarm spreads throughout the British Colonies and another, larger force is sent with the Iroquois being the target rather than the French. A Franco-Iroquois alliance is struck and the invasion is soundly defeated. To capitalize on their victory, the Iroquois go on the offensive and invade New England, quickly overrunning it before the colonists can recuperate from their losses.  After the war, the Iroquois are awarded control of all territory north of the Chesapeake Bay. The British Colonials are ordered to either join the Confederation or leaves. Most leave for Virginia and the Carolinas. This reduces the number of slaves in British North America as some of the immigrants provide a cheap source of labor as indentured servants and those well enough off stake out small farms in the Piedmont reducing the significance of the plantation system. The British remnant still in New England enter into a mutually beneficial relationship with the rest of the Confederation, establishing themselves as the new merchant class. The Iroquois get into directly trading with Europe and eventually construct their own Trans-Atlantic merchant fleet based in Boston Harbor. A “Pax-Iroquoisia” in the north-western part of the continent lasts into the 19th Century with smaller tribes being absorbed into the confederacy.  The colonies south of the Chesapeake begin to push west to the Mississippi River after a bloody war with the Cherokee and Creek. By the early 1800’s, most of what becomes Alabama and Mississippi becomes Anglicized. Tensions begin to arise between the plantation owners on the coast and the Mississippi River and the small farm holders from New England in the inland areas. The Cherokee adopt many reforms based on the Iroquois and try to build up their nation in the land between the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and the Appalachian Mountains. Unfortunately, they’re caught between a rock and a hard place as the Iroquois try to press them to join the Confederacy and the British colonists want to take over their territory.  West of the Mississippi, the Pawnee have begun a confederation of the Great Plains tribes. The Iroquois new found wealth attracts raiding parties that strike accosts the Mississippi with lightning speed do to the Pawnees' excellent horsemanship. The Iroquois respond by setting a series of small forts along the river with regular patrols. Thus begins the building of a professional army.  By about the 1840s, war will break out over the Cherokee Nation. The most likely situation is the Cherokee give in to being absorbed by the Iroquois. The British colonials (now either independent or with a large degree of autonomy) take this as a threat as it puts the Iroquois within striking distance of their heartland. The war is long, messy, and bloody but the victor will control the fate of eastern North America. Assuming an Iroquois victory means absorbing all territory down to the Tennessee River and possibly down to the Gulf of Mexico.  The rest of the 19th Century will see a great shift in Iroquois society. The decentralized nature of Iroquoian cities meant that industrialization would create many small factories linked by rivers rather than centralized industrial centers. In terms of religion, Christianity, as practiced by the remaining English colonists, and Iroquoian Longhouse Religion would eventually become indistinguishable as they both had many similarities and would likely adopt one another's practices over time. The Confederacy would also become a refuge of escaped slave fleeing from the British colonies (until slavery is outlawed). The French colonies in Quebec would also be annexed at some point, further increasing the ethnic and cultural melting pot the Confederacy had become."
HistoryWhatIf,393lgo,selfhatingyank,9,Tue Jun 9 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"In the OTL Odoacer is credited with ending the western Roman empire. Had he not sent the purple vestments to Constantinople, technically the western empire would not end - at least not while Odoacer remained alive.  Now Odoacer adopts the purple and because of his military support he is able to pacify the Roman institutions who can't believe a barbarian dares to claim the purple. He immediately has a stranglehold over Italy and like in the OTL continues to administrate as a ""king"" so to speak. emperor Zeno doesn't support Odoacer's claim to the purple, and instead supports Julian Nepos - who like the OTL is still assassinated. Zeno, however, can now neither support nor refute Odoacer's claim. With two of his foederati commanders in open rebellion, and his own regime unstable Zeno simply cannot risk conflict with Odoacer.  Eventually the rebellion amongst the foederati ends with Theodoric the Amal killing his sometimes rival, sometimes ally, Theodoric Strabo. This presents a perfect opportunity for Zeno who charges the goth, to reclaim Italy from the Imperial pretender, Odoacer.   Theodoric invades Italy and much like the OTL proves more than capable for Odoacer's mercenary herulian, scirian and rugian troops. However, Odoacer who has been proven a savvy, almost Machiavellian leader manages to seduce Theodoric to his side. He promises the Gothic commander: joint rule of Italy and the title of Augustus. Theodoric is placated with the offer, and accepts with the provision that his Gothic soldiers can settle in Italy. Odoacer without his best Herulian soldiers accepts.   The two ""emperors"" share power briefly but true to his nature, Theodoric strikes and kills Odoacer as he did in the OTL. He utters his last words of ""where is god"" and Theodoric is the sole emperor of Italy. He however drops the useless title, seeing it as the downfall of Odoacer and he declares himself the first king of Italy, and sends the vestments of office to Zeno. Thus resolving their feud, and establishing Zeno and Constantinople as masters of the Roman empire albeit only in name as Theodoric rules without any effective interference from the East.  So in short, Odoacer accepts the vestments of office as part of his coup but this causes his downfall to occur slightly earlier and he is remembered in history as the last unofficial emperor."

The rot at the centre was problematic and difficult for modern historians to discern what really led to the Roman Empire in the West's downfall - certainly an uncooperative army helps a state collapse.  That being said, historians like Peter Heather and Adrian Goldsworthy refute barbarisation of the military as a theory explaining the decline of the Roman Empire and the myth that the Romans were any less effective at fighting in this period."

I think Rome would have ended up relying on mercenaries much more (sort of like Carthage did), and also would have turned to non-Roman auxiliaries becoming the heart of the army much sooner than in OTL.   The Republic would have still ended -- maybe lasting a little bit longer (since there would not have been a bunch of powerful individuals with their own armies, as in OTL post Marian reforms), but the agent of its destruction would have probably instead been a non-roman general of the auxiliary and mercenary army gaining so much power that they use it to attack and conquer the Roman State -- which is what happened to end the western Roman empire in OTL."

HistoryWhatIf,392b05,hamjam5,2,Mon Jun 8 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"If Rome was relying on Mercenaries and Auxiliaries, with very little Roman soldiers at all, that means that proconsular and provincial armies would have consisted of Auxiliaries and mercenaries paid by the Roman state, not Romans who were expecting their commander to get them land at the end of their service. While there were still some commanders who would have been able to instill loyalty in such a force (the way Hannibal was able to with a force of a similar constitution), it would not have been as structurally certain to occur as it was in OTL. The forces, for the most part, since they were going to be paid by the Roman state and not their Commander, would have had less devotion to their commander. Indeed, with so many auxiliaries, commanders of the same nationality as the auxiliaries would have often been the actual military commanders (as occurred in OTL in the late Roman Empire era) .  All that said, Caesar was the kind of leader who would have made sure he, and not the auxiliaries, commanded the troops, and he would have been able to make them loyal to him, and not the Roman state.   I am honestly not sure if we get to Caesar though. I think that, during the Marian and Sulla wars, instead of Sertorius gaining power in Iberia, that would have been an actual Iberian Auxiliary commander doing so. And Pompey, instead of leading a Roman Army devoted to him, would have been leading an Auxilary and Mercenary army, with Auxilary sub-commanders -- all of questionable loyalty.   I think during this crisis (also the time of the Spartacus Revolt, and I believe an attack by Mithradates) that barbarian generals take control of the Roman armies in Iberia and Gaul, and declare their independence from Rome. The Sullan armies that have taken Rome from Marius's faction consist of men and commanders of questionable loyalty, and they are unable to defeat the secession movements in Iberia and Gaul. They may even revolt from the Roman generals that oversee them and march on Rome.   With this level of turmoil, Mithridates is able to take control of Asia Minor and Greece. Sulla ends up offering enough concessions to the Italian allies to get them not to revolt as well, but it is all he can do to fight off former Roman barbarian auxiliary legions invading Italy and to end the Spartacus revolt.  The result is a somewhat Romanized Gaul and Iberia being ruled using many of the Roman political structures, by Gauls and Iberians who formerly served in the Roman legions. Iberia also invades and takes control of North Africa (which Sertorius attempted and failed to do in our timeline). Italy ends up embracing the very reforms Sulla had fought against -- but, with Mithridates taking over the east, Rome now only controls the Italian peninsula."

A different set of reforms (for example, something akin to the early regimental system as instituted in the UK) would have some interesting effects on Roman society. For example, if the soldiers weren't so dependent on the popularity and political acumen of their generals to be rewarded for their service, the Civil Wars might have gone completely differently (although these were also probably inevitable). This kind of Army would have required a proper military bureaucracy, which in turn might have led to the professionalization of tax collection, etc. Presuming all these posts didn't end up in the hands of slaves and freedmen, a proper bourgeoisie with serious political aspirations and enough influence to push through popular reforms in governance might have emerged, eventually leading to a truly representative organ within the Empire instead of (or alongside) the quasi-oligarchy of the Senate.

With the loss of so many men and vast quantities of war materials, England is even more vulnerable than they were OTL. With such a coup in hand, Hitler and Goering batter the RAF into submission with the airfield bombing runs.   While the surface fleet of the Kriegsmarine is almost completely destroyed protecting the invasion fleet from the Royal Navy, the Wehrmacht gets ashore. Fierce fighting ensues in the south of England, but with so few troops and so few weapons, they cannot stop the landings, nor contain them. The only hope is to use the remnants of the Royal Navy to interdict the supply convoys, which works to an extent. What is left of the RN is sunk by marauding U-boats and naval bombers patrolling the English Channel. Even so, enough supplies are airlifted over to keep the Wehrmacht fighting.  With the fall of London, the game is over. While the British Army will fight on in the countryside and hole up in Ireland and Scotland, the British Isles will fall completely by May 1941. What is left of the British military will regroup in Canada, getting ready for the next blow or to await the entry of America into the war.   Without any source of supplies, the British army in the desert falls. The Italians go on to secure all of North Africa, and, seeing the English are weak, the Middle East erupts with pro-German partisans. With a source of oil secured, and the southern flank now secured, Hitler looks to the East.   Barbarossa proceeds as normal, but without distractions in Greece, Yugoslavia, Crete, and the North African desert, not to mention the Luftwaffe not having to fight off the RAF, goes much smoother. While still not able to capture Moscow, due to the heavy rains, poor roads, and fanatical desperation the Soviets show (remember, they are own there own at this point), the Germans are able to hold their ground much better.   With the arrival of clearer weather and firmer ground, Moscow falls in the summer of 1942. While Stalin had prepared for this, and evacuated as much of the Soviet leadership and factories as he could, it is still a solid blow. His leadership is called into question, especially after the subsequent loss of Leningrad to combined German and Finnish forces. When the next German campaign begins to conquer all before it in the Caucasus, Stalin sues for peace.   While I don't know enough to accurately determine where the boundaries are, or what exactly the terms would be, I can assume that they are heavily in the Germans favor. I am going to assume vast quantities of raw materials, such as oil, coal, metal ores, and the like are part of the deal.  Fall of 1942. Hitler has most of Europe under his thumb at this point. Sure, there are partisan movements and resistance bands to deal with. Yes, a lot of manpower is needed to garrison the conquered territories. But, Russia is knocked out of the war, and England is on her knees. He has joined Japan in declaring war on the US, but doesn't really see them as a threat. Where will they invade? The U-boats own the eastern Atlantic, and behind that shield, the Kriegsmarine is rebuilding and preparing for an invasion of the northeastern seaboard. A large fleet of battleships, carriers, and their escorts are building at naval yards, both in Germany itself and in captured ports from the French and English. While these preparations won't be complete until 1945, the Wehrmacht can use that time to train and equip its battle hardened troopers with a new generation of tanks and equipment- such as the Panther tank, the STG44 assault rifle, and jet planes.   While all this has been going on, the US has been busy. Realizing that with England out of the war, America is in a clear and present danger. Roosevelt manages to convince Congress to vastly increase the military budgets. While there is still a serious public opinion against getting involved in the war, the fall of England convinces many that something will need to be done. With the fall of Moscow looking imminent, the military budgets are raised yet again, and war production begins in earnest. At this point, it is only a matter of time before the US will declare war.   With the US gearing up for war, the Navy is placed on high alert. While the Pacific fleet still takes a heavy blow on December 7 1941, it is not nearly as bad as OTL, as they were on high alert. While most have heavy damage, only a few are sunk, and the Japanese carrier force takes a heavy blow as many of the pilots are shot down.   Summer 1944. The middle Atlantic is a battleground. German U-boat and surface ships duke it out against what is left of the Royal Navy and the US Navy. Losses are roughly equal. While the Germans can concentrate on only one ocean, they are not as skilled nor as technologically advanced as the Allies, though that gap is narrowing quickly. Newer ships are entering the fray every week for the Kriegsmarine, while the US has to begin pulling ships from the Pacific to hold them off. The battle is at a tipping point. It is only a matter of time until one side begins to claim an edge.  Spring, 1945. With the construction of a large surface navy, the Germans begin to push. Using Greenland and Iceland as bases, they begin to probe ever closer to New England and eastern Canada. While the war in Asia has been going well for America, the ever-increasing pressure from Germany has been slowing them down. More and more often, naval and air units are being transferred to fight in the Atlantic. Nevertheless, Japan is forced back to the home islands by early summer, and the Pacific fleet receives orders to contain them and prepare for an invasion.  Spring, 1946. Naval combat has been going back and forth for years, neither side gaining an advantage. More and more units of the US Navy have been transferred over, but can only manage to maintain the struggle. However, with the detonation of the atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in late 1945, the US Navy can now fully commit to fighting in the Atlantic. But before this can happen, the Germans embark on a daring plan.   With trained special forces, they plan to sabotage the Panama Canal. While losses are heavy, the canal is rendered inoperable for six months. This forces the US Navy to go the long way around, by way of Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America.   Emboldened by this victory, the Germans launch an amphibious invasion of Canada. While the logistics are rough, the front line troops are kept supplied well enough to being capturing ports. Enough supplies have been stockpiled in Greenland and Iceland to keep the armies moving. While fighting heroically, the British and Canadians simply do not have the manpower to hold back the Wehrmacht for long. Before much time passes, resistance crumbles and the Germans begin to hold territory very close to the US.  While the US Army is large and well equipped, they do have some serious flaws. Years of combat experience in the jungles and islands of the Pacific are not going to help much in a stand up fight against the Wehrmacht juggernaut. Combined arms operations, which the Germans are masters at, is something understood only in theory. Even though they are well equipped and almost fully mechanized, the US armored divisions are still using M4A3E2/E8 Shermans, and only now beginning to equip with the Pershing. Even so, how to use them effectively isn't fully understood. Also, most of the troops are green- there wasn't any fighting over in Europe for them to gain combat experience in. With the German blitzkrieg raging through the Northeast, the difficult terrain slows them down more than the brave US resistance.   Growing desperate, the Americans realize they only have one hope. It is only a matter of time before the Germans break out. While the fighting is heavy, they are simply outgunned and out maneuvered. The only hope is to use a nuclear bomb and scare the Germans into a cease fire. With the fall of Boston a week before, they have their place to destroy. An all out effort by the Ninth Air Force gains the upper hand over the skies of Boston, but won't be able to hold it for long.   A B-29 carrying the third atomic bomb to be dropped in anger leaves the runway on July 17, 1946. The mission was a success. While many pilots and planes were lost, and most of the city destroyed in the process, it was judged worth it. Realizing that the Americans must have more of these bombs, and having seen their willingness to use them, a truce is called, and an eventual treaty between the two is signed. America remains dominant over the Western Hemisphere. Germany gains control of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.   Where to go from here? America will probably fund partisan movements in conquered Europe, the Middle East, and what is left of Russia. It won't be easy though. As to what happens next, I can't really say.  Anyway, didn't plan on that much text. But, realistically, there wasn't much hope for Germany to really win. This is something that I believe is reasonable, assuming a mild dose of Hitler having hindsight. Please, give criticism as you think needed."

Oh, they're great against merchant ships; fully armed naval vessels...not so much (that's why the ""Happy Time"" ended, after all). In fact, given there's no longer an England to ship to under your scenario, uboats are pretty much a useless vessel at this point in the war, so really, Germany's navy is even smaller.  And as for ""relatively easy"", an amphibious invasion is never ""relatively easy"" even if you don't have a navy and airforce four or five times your size bombing the hell out of it even before you land.

And it still took the Allies almost one year to push the Germans back after D-Day and Operation Bagration. You fail to realize that it took the Soviets roughly a year to go from Belarus to Berlin while fighting the Germans with a 3 to 1 favor.

HistoryWhatIf,38z71p,maxman98,3,Mon Jun 8 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"Those are two different things. Successfully invade Canada sure that is possible. Hold it and win the war isn't.  The U.S. seizes and occupies the major Canadian cities located along its border. The British are busy with Napoleon fail to send adequate reinforcements after the initial successful American invasion. The Americans close they St. Lawrence River to British traffic. Isolated British forces still control the Vancouver area and various forts in what are now the prairie provinces because they are just to far away to bother with. Newfoundland remains in British hands, the U.S. does not have the navy to attempt and invasion. In the Maritime provinces there is a major battle on the border between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in the area around Ft. Cumberland and Lawrence on the Isthmus of Chignecto sometime in 1813. We will even give it to the Americans because of failure on the British part to reinforce the area adequately.    Taking Halifax is a major coup for the Americans, but most its defenses are seaward facing so again we will let the Americans have the best luck possible and take it. There is no way the Americans can stop the British from reinforcing Halifax be sea so its going to be into 1814 before it falls after a lengthy siege. Halifax falls in spring 1814 just as Napoleon abdicates. The British now turn their attention to lost Canada.  Negotiations to end the war will not start in Aug 1814 as in IRL.   Newfoundland and the more remote areas along the Hudson Bay are reinforced with troops from Europe. A spring 1815 campaign is planned by the British but called off because of Napoleon's 100 days. Meanwhile even with the 100 days the British fleet is no longer tied down embargoing France and runs rampant along the American coast. The tiny American fleet (numbering the the dozens, and the largest ships frigates of 40 some guns) has no chance against the hundreds of ships of the British fleet including dozens of ships of the line with 70+ guns.  Minor British landings occur along the U.S. seaboard some successful some not, but they stretch the U.S. army thin defending the coast and Canada.  The British burn Washington, the battles of Ft. Mchenry and those outside Washington and Baltimore happen as IRL.  Immediately after Waterloo the full might of the British Army consisting of hundreds of thousands of veteran troops load directly from the ports in continental Europe and ship to America,  not just the handful that came IRL. With the seizure of Canada the senior experienced generals (Wellington) who did not want to participate IRL have no problem leading that army. The largest amphibious invasion the world has seen to date retakes Halifax in late summer 1815. The British take and hold New Orleans, the Georgia coast at St. Mary's, Pensacola, Fl (technically Spanish but the British take it as a base to move on Mobile), and burn other cities on the mid Atlantic since the Americans have a limited army and its tied up occupying and defending Canada.   The British might lose a few battles after this but they dominate the ocean. They can land with impunity anywhere they want. The American mobile army runs itself to death trying to come to grips with the British landings. The major British force outnumbers the more static American army in Canada by several times. It waits until spring 1816 before marching out of Halifax and then retakes Canada, as well as parts of Maine as quickly as they can march to those places. As the Americans start to lose ground, have no trade left and see their coastal cities burned (Charleston, Savannah, Washington, Norfolk, Portsmouth etc) they start negotiations. New York and Boston are spared destruction because of the harbor defenses in place just make the not worth the effort.  The British demand their Native American puppet state in the midwest as well as the return of Canada and trade rights on the Mississippi. There is no way the British are backing down, the British public is upset about continuing war and taxes but the Americans took British territory, its about saving face now and putting an upstart country in its place.  The British get most their demands when the war is officially over in 1817. The native buffer state puts a massive damper on U.S. westward expansion in the north. That state is supported by the British and the U.S. fights at least one more war with it in the next few decades. Eventually that state collapses and the U.S. gets the territory but its white settlement is pushed back by 40 years. The states eventually created from the area are dominated by Native Americans. Without the influx of free states in the midwest the southern states retain a lot more power in Congress. There is no tit for tat entrance of free states and slave states leading up to the 1860s. Most growth of the U.S. occurs in the south. The U.S. remains a slave holding country as long as Brazil in the 1880s. There is no U.S. Civil War. The U.S. does not become an industrial nation as quickly. It also loses out on the Pacific Northwest, that area remains with Canada and the British. Without the Pacific northwest there is no incentive to purchase Alaska, it too ends up as part of Canada. The U.S. fights and wins the Mexican American war. It wants the territory badly.   The U.S. still comes into conflict with Spain, its an easy target and the desire for Cuba is even stronger than IRL. The U.S. takes and retains Cuba. It becomes a hotbed of rebellion for the next 50 years until the U.S. finally lets it go. The U.S. however does not take the Philippines and other Pacific islands from Spain. It lacks the industrial capacity for a two ocean navy at the time and by the time its primary Atlantic fleet sails around the world to Manila the war is over.  During WWI the U.S. is not as great a supplier of arms, it lacks the industrial capacity of the midwest that is 40 years behind.  It does eventually join the war, but its participation looks more like that of Brazil's, minor and of little note. Without the U.S. defended Philippines blocking their trade routes the Japanese have much less incentive to drag the U.S. into a war. Instead of attacking Pearl Harbor they concentrate on Singapore, Hong Kong and the Dutch East Indies. Eventually the U.S. does enter the war in Europe on the side of the Allies but its reduced industrial capacity makes the war a longer affair. The Russians bear the brunt of this, millions more die, and they retain all of Germany after the war not just the East. The allies eventually turn on Japan. Its a long hard war. The Soviets are required and a amphibious invasion of Japan goes down in history as the greatest atrocities ever seen. Millions of Japanese die, not just from combat but famine and starvation as well as the allied troops. Japan is partitioned. Rather than 2 superpowers after the war there is the Soviet Union and a collection of more equal western allies who form the U.N. The Soviets see little reason to participate. WWIII between the west and the Soviets starts with a Soviet invasion of Western Europe in support of Communist revolutionaries in France. Nuclear weapons are exchanged but not in the numbers the super powers would have had. Western Europe is devastated as the allies use them to destroy Soviet armies, western cities are destroyed in retaliation."

Option 1: The emperor doesn't fail, he simply remains as a silent figurehead in the case that someone usurps power. This is how it was through most of Japanese medieval history with the shogun system and so on, up until the Meiji Restoration, where others restored the Meiji emperor to a position of political power.  Option 2: The monarch doesn't concern himself with popular support. Even the prime minister wouldn't kill himself over simply losing an election.

I see no reason why Akihito does not ascend to the throne, at least officially.  Unofficially, Hirohito was not in full control of the country during the war years, and it's unlikely that his adolescent son exercises any more authority than his father did.    What this does to Japanese politics is another matter, and it's possible the new emperor becomes a mouthpiece of one faction or another.  Which faction that is would be anyone's guess.  In the third option, I do not see Akihito becoming emperor, given that postwar Japan needed a leader, and an adolescent boy is not likely to be that individual.  The Allies allowed Japan to retain a monarchy, but there was already a reigning emperor of sufficient age and experience in 1945.  If there were not one, my hunch is that the Japanese monarchy goes the way of the Ottoman Empire or Iran's in the 20th century.  Japan becomes a republic rather than a constitutional monarchy.

There is literally no way this would work. But lets say he doesn't hate communists.  Germany, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania, Italy, Bulgaria and Japan become know as the Axis powers in early 1940. Germany and the Soviet Union have already fought, not together, but near each other on the same side in Poland. So suddenly Hitler has 20 million more men at his disposal. By spring of 1940 Soviet troops are being shuttled across Poland and Germany to the French border. So instead of 3 million invading soldiers, now 5 million cross the border. France falls in a little less than a month. The Axis forces come on so fast there is no time for the Dunkirk evacuation. The BEF surrenders and France is quickly taken up. As there is now so much man power that a complete conquest of France can be achieved Vichy France does not exist.  Fall 1941. Stalin and Hitler meet together for the first time to discuss strategy. The Luftwaffe, flying German AND Soviet planes, are reducing London to a crater with the added man and production power. Hitler and Stalin agree to a plan involving a misdirection to mask the invasion of England. The Red Army, under the commnd of Stalin himself, marches over 1,000,000 men into the Balkans with the plan to kick the British out of Greece and then reverse and move down into the Middle East to capture Egypt and the Suez Canal. For the past 6 months, 10,000,000 Axis troops have moved into France as well and are sitting on the coast at Normandy. Russian tanks have been rolling off the line faster than could be imagined and German arms and munitions are filling up the stockpiles faster than they can be made. Russian oil is powering the tanks. Imprisoned Jews are doing the work. The Axis powers look unstoppable. Stalin attacks the Balkans and crushes the British in Greece easily and begin, slowly, the march down into Egypt. As the British quickly rush whatever reinforcements they feel they can to Egypt to help Montgomery hold the Suez, the Kreigsmarine has target practice with the transport vessels. As soon as Stalin first battles with Montgomery's army in Africa, Operation Sealion begins. 10 million Axis soldiers pour across the English Channel into Britain. Dover is quickly taken and London soon follows. England holds out for a month. The remnants of the English army hole up in Scotland and wait until they everntually surrender. Stalin eventually crushes Montgomery and takes the Suez canal as well as all of North Africa. Meanwhile, Japan is cobbling up English colonial holdings very quickly. Stocked with Russian oil, Japan has no need to attack Pearl Harbor when the USA cuts off their oil supplies. Japan takes all of China as well as the rest of south east Asia. Stalin's army in North Africa and Japan's army converge on India from both sides. The Indian resistance is fierce and requires reinforcements from both sides to be broken. Eventually though India falls and nearly all of the England's Dominion lays in the hands of Axis. Japanese and German forces take what remains of Africa. Australia and New Zealand also falls quickly to Soviet and Japanese forces.  Early 1943. To this point the United States has stayed out of the war. But as German, Japanese, and Soviet forces take South Africa, it is obvious that North America becomes the next logical target. Because the USA had no need to do intense research into an atomic bomb they are still years away from developing that weapon. The USA did build up their Navy to protect shipping convoys across the Atlantic but no the US has no trading partners across the Atlantic. Roosevelt declares war on Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union in early 1943. Then its Sietzkreig version 2. Soviet and Japanese forces build up in Japan. German, Soviet, and Italian forces build up in England. The USA feverishly shifts the war machine into high gear. Warships are being pumped out as fast as possible. Submarines, tanks, munitions, arms, aircraft, uniforms, etc. The draft is on and the United States army swells to 10,000,000 standing with several millions in reserve. Canada also raises its army to a little under a million. Nearly all of the Pacific and Atlantic coastlines are bristling with defenses by mid-1943. It has become obvious to Hitler and Stalin that their chance to make an easy breakthrough of the United States had passed but with the mass of man power that was possessed they decided to make a go of it anyways.  Mid-1944. Invasion force A leaves from England, France, and Germany first on June 6, 1944 (ironic eh?) and begin the journey to the North American coast. Invasion force B leaves South Africa on June 8, 1944. Invasion force C leaves the Japanese home islands on June 10, 1944. The build up of American naval forces is countered by the Kreigsmarine, which inherited the Royal Navy on the surrender of England. The naval battle preceeds the actual invasion force and the Axis navies blast a path straight to their objectives. Group A, mostly German, converted French and English, Italian, and triparte-pact troops, blasts its way into Southern Canada and the North United States starting on July 4, 1944. Boston falls to the Axis by early August. Group B is molested less by the US Navy and lands in Panama on July 10, 1944. They must overcome fierce resistance though and the first invasion attempt falters. The Soviet and Japanese troops eventually break the defenses and capture the Panama canal, which is mostly blown apart, and begin their steamrolling of the weak Mexican resistance. The rest of South America, save Brazil, surrenders to the Axis forces. Stalin personally accepts the surrenders in Bogota in fall 1944. Group C lands in San Francisco after many near misses with the US Navy in the Pacific. The Soviet and Japanese soldiers quickly take the beaches and San Francisco, LA, Vancouver, and Las Vegas fall in short order.  Fall 1944. The Axis advance continues in earnest. Group A, being the largest, splits into 2 invasion parties. Group A-1 moves inland and north towards Montreal and Toronto. Both Montreal and Toronto are fiercely defended but the Canadians just don't have the man power to hold them. The rest of the group sweeps down the north east, shrugging off the massive amount of casualties because they just have so many soldiers to replace them with. The USA gets desperate when German artillery shells start falling on Washington DC. An untested version of the atomic bomb falls on Boston to attempt to destroy the German bastion there but the bomb, being hastily engineered, fails to explode. But German engineers are able to use the design of the unexploded bomb to hammer out a version of their own. The first test of the German atomic bomb occurs in Siberia in late 1944. The test is successful and by early 1945, with Group A in Washington DC, Group B up through Texas and Louisiana and in Atlanta, and Group C in and around Denver, the first Axis atomic bomb falls on Chicago. With the massive success of the bomb in destroying the will of the defenders atomic bombs rain down on Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Calgary, Montgomery, St. Louis, and Topeka.  Mid-1945. The German invasion groups meet in the remains of Chicago in June 1945 about a year after they left their respective starting points. The United States unconditionally surrenders to the Axis Powers in July 1945. Canada had already surrendered in January of 1945 after the fall of Calgary. The only country left standing is Brazil and a small invasion force quickly eliminates them too. Now the Soviet Union, Japan, and Germany as well as the other smaller states of the Axis powers own the entire planet.  Early 1946. Stalin, Hitler, Yamamoto (now leader of Japan), and Mussolini meet in Washington DC to discuss how to run their new territory. The world is partitioned into 4 sections. Germany and Japan split the United States right down the center with the Germans occupying the east and the Japanese with the west. German also occupies all of western Europe from Germany to England. The Soviet Union occupies all of south Asia and eastern Europe. Japan occupies all of South East Asia and Australia as well as New Zealand and South America. Italy occupies all of Africa.

HistoryWhatIf,38x6ky,Jomanji,6,Sun Jun 7 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"Robert Moses was behind a lot of road infrastructure, and was only able to build it by leveraging Triboro Bridge toll money and federal dollars. So a lot of road infrastructure does not get built, and what does get built probably isn't linked to highway networks very well. Most likely the only fully-fledged highways in the five boroughs would skirt the waterfronts of the outer boroughs, and there are no highways in Manhattan. This saves a lot of neighborhoods. He also influenced a lot of plans in other American towns, so they also have reduced highway construction.  What highways do get built are not designed on purpose to prevent mass transportation. Highways like the Van Wyck would probably be developed more similarly to those in Chicago, with median-running rapid transit right of ways. (In OTL, municipal leaders lobbied for median rapid transit in the LIE and the Van Wyck, so that Eastern Queens and JFK Airport could get rapid transit links, but Moses would have none of it.) And because of the reduced amount of highway links into and out of the city, the New York metropolitan area does not become as sprawly as it is today; the suburbs north and east of the city are both smaller and more compact. Likewise, transit is given more of a share of the available money and the subway system does not experience its deterioration in the '70s (or at least the deterioration is slower.)  He was also a parks commissioner and in charge of public housing at various points in his public career. Not as many neighborhoods get destroyed for public housing developments, but there are also not as many parks. What parks do exist are more easily accessible for people of color, as he was criticized by some for not building parks facilities accessible to those in minority neighborhoods. The Giants and Dodgers most likely do not leave the city, and the disaster that is the 1964 World's Fair never happens."
HistoryWhatIf,38x6ky,bobtehpanda,2,Sun Jun 7 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"The impact Robert Moses had on New York's infrastructural, economic, and social development is incalculable, and so I really doubt that any post on here could really grasp the full implications of his absence.  While it might be easy to map the other paths the state and region may have taken to tackle issues that Moses approached in his uniquely bombastic and grand style in OTL, it would be much more difficult to imagine how communities developed that might not have been split by expressways, or how communities on Long Island might have developed without easy access to Manhattan via expressways, or if the large estates of the barons remained undivided by these roads.  Also, this is all without taking into account the impact Moses had on American municipal and state government institutional design.  Moses's ability to consolidate power for himself and those he could use to further his visions changed American governmental institutional design and was an important part of the decline of old-money control of American public projects.  So with all of that in mind, I can suggest a number of scenarios that might have been had Moses never risen to his positions of power, particularly surrounding infrastructure projects that I know more about.  First, The Upper West Side is a neighborhood that would have had a tremendously different course had Moses never been there to push his pet project, Riverside Park.  Without the park, the UWS would never have maintained its high property values (even during NYC's roughest years the UWS was relatively stable in price), and it would have been subject to the harshness of NYC's dirty years.  It probably would be as expensive and elite neighborhood today, but one with a far grittier atmosphere.  If Moses had not been there to stymie subway growth, the system likely would have been larger, with service along Second Avenue, protection for some of the elevated trains in the outer boroughs, and a more robust commuter system with more capacity into New Jersey, Rockland, and Westchester Counties.  The LIRR would have remained the fundamental link between NYC and communities on the Island as well, and the junction towns along these railroads might have preserved more of their urban-ness in the absence of highways that bypassed them.  The differences that the Bronx might have felt are not so clear to me because I know less about the communities cut apart by the cross bronx.  If someone wants to give their opinion, by al means."

Based on a very limited reading of medieval English history the Angles and Saxons imported a great deal of the foundation of modern western culture into Britain including political traditions and organization, legal systems, customs, and the like.   If the Celts prevent or evict the Germanic invasions then this change also impacts Germany of the time which can have radical impacts on mainland Europe.

If there was in fact a British warlord who could unite the disparate kingdoms of southern Britain enough to halt the Saxon advance, it could stand to reason this same person with enough power and influence might be able to reverse it.

Only wood, agriculture and fishing. Plus, it was directly administered from Peru and when that was taken, the island was alone and the soldiers deserted when the Chilean army came, since they were tired of being miserable.  The main reason Chile was founded, it was because Pedro de Valdivia wanted to reach the Straight of Magellean, but southern Chile is a large archipielago of mountains, like the Alaskan panhandle. Chiloé was larger, flatter, slightly warmer and more fertile than the land to the south. If Spain really wants to hold on to it, the Chilean army would basically have to miss every shot and the Spanish garrison would have to be supplied directly from Spain, which is a huge distance, and most likely being intercepted by the US, who wouldn't like Spain meddling in it.  Assuming they manage to get supplies and not being in shitty conditions. Spain would have tried to claim the area around the Straight of Magellean, which would most likely piss off the US, since Chile has a claim with Chiloé and to the south, plus they would have to sail through hostile places in order to get to California, which should be booming.

HistoryWhatIf,38tkqa,HaydenHank,4,Sat Jun 6 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"This actually was very close to happening, you would not even need that radical of a departure point from OTL.   In September of 1914, right before Villa and Zapata broke with Carranza and Obregon, Villa had an opportunity to have Obregon shot. He decided not to do so.   Soon after, Villa and Zapata broke with Carranza and Obregon. Villa's army had been quite successful up to that point, but, they could not defeat Obregon, who was trained using modern military tactics. Indeed, Villa did a better job fighting the U.S. excursion into Northern Mexico then he did fighting Obregon (and his army was in a much better state prior to fighting Obregon).   Obregon thus broke Villa's military hegemony over Northern Mexico, and this in turn left Zapata's Liberation Army of the South permanently isolated from the overall civil war, allowing it to be liquidated when it was convenient.   However, if Villa assassinated Obregon, Carranza did not have another tactician of his caliber, and Villa's tactics, which had been successful thus far, most likely allow him to keep control of the north. And, if he was not in a desperate situation following losses to Obregon (as he was in OTL) he would not have invaded the U.S., forcing them to get involved as they did.   I think eventually he would have worked out his differences with his Conventionist ally Zapata, and supplied him the support Zapata requested, thus allowing the Army in the North and the Army in the South to retake Mexico City and exert military hegemony over Mexico.   Now, Zapata, Villa and their supporters are not Marxist Communists, they are much more in line with the Mexican Anarchist Magonista ideology. Thus, their government would have been much more decentralized and ant-authoritarian than what we saw under the Bolsheviks.  I think they end up creating a very socialistic democratic constitution based on federalism with strong local autonomy (Zapata would have demanded this), and a fairly skeletal central government.   They certainly would have started giving land to the poor in a mass scale, and perhaps even giving factories to worker councils (a promise which would have helped siphon off some of the anarcho-syndicalist support that Obregon helped Carranza secure in OTL).   The question though is U.S. involvement.   In OTL, the U.S. actually supported Villa until he invaded the U.S. in 1915. If he would not have been desperate enough to do this, I don't think the U.S. would have invaded Mexico just to stop Villa from gaining power. But, the U.S. did invade Mexico when the property of U.S. corporation were threatened during the Mexican Revolution -- so, if the new Villa and Zapata supported government tried to nationalize or threaten U.S. concerns, the U.S. would have intervened.   Personally, I don't think Villa (a ruthless pragmatist if there ever was one) would allow this to happen. But, let's say he did. Or, more likely, let's say he doesn't (or can't) stop the more ardent Mexican revolutionaries, flush on the success of a revolution rife with socialistic rhetoric, who decide to take over the land and holding of U.S. firms.   The U.S. by this time would have been involved in World War 1. Judging on how bad their excursions into Mexico to capture Villa in 1915 in OTL went (clue -- they never caught Villa), and now imagining them fighting a more unified Mexico with a Villista army more supplied and manned, I am not sure how well the U.S. invasion would go. I am thinking a Vietnam level of quagmire. Plus, how would the fairly radicalized socialist workers movement react in the U.S. to their government invading a democratic government to snuff out a socialist revolution? Remember, this was the height of the radical socialist workers movement in the U.S.   I think the amount of agitation on the homefront (caused by seeing socialist revolutions topple Russia and now Mexico), along with the bad PR of invading a democratic nation while talking about fighting a world war in the name of democracy, plus the loss of life and treasure such an invasion into a revolutionary fervent Mexico  -- all this would have caused the U.S. to either not start the invasion, or to pull out once they saw it would not be an old fashioned cake-a-walk-a.    Now, I also think having a non-Marxist socialist Mexico would be a huge game changer for world history. Some possibilities:   1) Dan Carlin points this out in his episode ""Radical Thoughts"", but, there is a theory (that I also subscribe to) that, the Bolsheviks coming to power in Russia actually hurt the international socialist movement, because it created a view that theirs was the only way to do socialist revolution, and it caused all the different varieties of socialist revolution to be marginalized and weakened in favor of Marxist-Leninism -- and this is something the Bolsheviks actively and financially supported occurring as well.  So, if Mexico exists as a counterbalance to the Bolshevik idea of socialist revolution, it would give more credence and support to those supporting non-Bolshevik style authoritarian socialism.   2) Perhaps, with the support of Mexico, the Spanish Anarchists are actually successful. One of the largest issues they had was that they did not have enough weapons to fight with, and were thus forced to compromise with the Marxist controlled Republican government, just in order to have the supplies needed to fight. If they were able to get armaments from Mexico, they would not have had to compromise with the Marxists or the Republican government, and would have been able to operate from a much stronger and independent position.   3) The Labor movement in America would have been affected to some degree. Even in OTL we saw many IWW and radical workers move to Mexico during the revolution. I think you would have seen much more of this in the alternate timeline. The radical ideas would have spread to many of the Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans in the South West, and, over the decades, into American culture in general. I think you would also see a more socialistic civil rights movement than in OTL. By the time of the tumult of the 60's and 70's, the anti-war and socialist student groups, civil rights and black power empowerment groups,  coupled with a little more leftist work force, and much more leftist hispanic population, could pose a real threat to American stability. Imagine things like the Kent state reaction, or the reaction to MLK being assassinated -- but now imagine those reactions as performed by a much more politically radicalized population. You may have seen the fall of the government, like what happened in France in 68 -- or perhaps something even worse.   4) Latin America. Latin America, spurred in part by U.S. destructive imperialist policies,  was (and is) already a hot bed for socialist and radical political ideologies. With Mexico going red, and then being able to provide physical assistance, as well as an example, the socialist movement in Latin America would have been much larger.    Yeah, this is definitely one of my time machine moments -- Damn it Villa, just shoot Obregon. It is the only way to prevent a world where the Sentinels round us all up into death camps."

Ever since the Stuarts gained the throne of England the British Isles was already under the reign of one person. It is very sensible for that person to try to unite the Kingdoms for efficiency in ruling. This is the reason why he styled himself as King of Great Britain and Ireland despite the fact there was no Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by that time.

England had started to reform its navy from the time of Henry VII, and further under Mary, so the foundation for the British Empire was set some 50-150 years before the union. Just before the Union of Crowns, Elizabeth signed the charter for the East India Company, and colonial efforts in North America started a decade or so beforehand in the 1580s. So it was prior to the union we truly saw the birth of the British Empire. Looking at it this way, England's power may have grown to a similar level of Britain's regardless of the union. But there are many other things to consider.  The 'Auld Allienace' between France and Scotland could have continued far into the future. There is potential for Scotland to interfere in future conflicts between England and France. The Seven Years War played an important role in increasing British control over North America, with about half of French territory being ceded to Britain. If Scotland can somehow prevent this, then it's very possible that we have an independent Quebec nowadays and maybe even no Canada at all.  Scotland may have supported Napoleon, but I question whether they could have prevented Trafalgar, so a French invasion of England is still unlikely.  Also to consider that if James I was not named Elizabeth's successor, and she had named no other successor, then England would have been thrown into a succession crisis. Could there have been a civil war? If so, at this point it's too hard to determine what would become of England in the future. But England overcame civil war in the future anyway, if that's any indicator that the empire would have survived through that."

During Blucher's naptime, his chief of staff von Gneisenau picked the campaign winning retreat route: Wavre.  This allowed the Prussians a shorter route to Waterloo than Grouchy's French corps.    Napoleon's plan for the campaign was brilliant, if perhaps reckless according to some, and his army was incredibly dangerous.  Really it was just that they were so outnumbered, situations like Grouchy getting beat on the hop by the Prussians couldn't be allowed if they were to succeed.

It's not that he's pre-Hitler or anything like that, or even the grudges over lands taken and given away. Napoleon in power, even the limited powers he gave himself by 1815, threatens the very existence of the royal houses of Europe. Which is why Prussia, Austria, Russia, Spain, the HRE, and England worked so dang hard to restore the Bourbons.   To answer your question as a proper What If, then Waterloo needs to be as decisive as Ligny should have been (Napoleon by rights should have been able to smash the Prussians to bits that day but alas...) and bring an end to that coalition. The British are pretty busy fighting the Americans at this point too so it would be a while enough until they could get right proper reinforcements. If Napoleon can win over the francophone Belgians he might just have a chance (and a pretty great buffer until the Germans industrialize in the following century) which was his plan to begin with. Once he has French borders secured he probably wouldn't pursue annexing more of that juicy French-German territory. If he does that maybe just maybe he gets left alone. When he dies, assuming he still dies in 1821 from some gastric cancer or other then once he dies there would be strong efforts by the Monarchies of Europe to push for a reinstatement of the French royal line and sweep the Napoleon business under the rug and then it's really up to the French how they swing.

Ungava would likely get to become a province. There were also plans for Montreal to secede as well incase of a successful referendum. They would also likely become its own province. In addition, thousands of companies would of moved across the river to Ontario. Thousands had already moved in the days prior and thousands would move after a successful Pro-Independence vote. This would destroy Quebec's economy. More so because among those companies that moved the election was the Bank of Quebec. All military bases would be striped of anything of value and likely destroyed. Federal services and federal civil servants would be pulled form the province. Without Ungava, there is no Hydro-Quebec. To quote Partition: The Price of Quebec’s Independence by Lionel Albert and William Shaw: ""The resulting independent Quebec republic would contain somewhat less than one-quarter of the province’s total landmass, have a population of around 2.9 million, and would be about 97% French-speaking. The parts remaining in Canada would contain over three million residents, of whom about two-thirds would be French-speaking.""  To summaries my points (continuing the quote):   . The northern two-thirds of the province would be retained by Canada following independence, on the basis that the territory had been assigned (not ceded) to the Province of Quebec in two steps, in 1898 and 1912  . All Quebec territory south of the St. Lawrence River would also be retained by Canada, on the basis of the 18th-century claim of the then-colonies of New York and Massachusetts to these lands, which had been abandoned by the British Crown only after Quebec had been captured by Britain in 1759  . The Pontiac region of west Quebec, the lower north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the western part of the island of Montreal would remain in Canada on the basis that local populations are predominantly non-Francophone, and presumably therefore would be Canadian rather than Québécois in their loyalties  What is left is very little. It has little industrialization and is mostly agrican. It will be economically dominated by the US and Canada.

You seemed pretty comfy quoting from Wikipedia so I'll include some of the rebuttals from further down the page that aren't totally specious (because honestly, most of this nonsense has gaping holes and awkward implications by its very nature)    Partition is based on the undemocratic assumption that Quebec is not divisible as long as it is voting ""No"" to secession, but that it is divisible as soon as it votes ""Yes."" ""The partitionists argue that 'No' voters should have more rights than 'Yes' voters. In 1980 and again in 1995, sovereigntist voters accepted with good grace the majority decision. According to the partitionists, some 'No' voters could ignore democracy, refuse the verdict and change the rules of the game. This would be an intolerable injustice…. [Do] you think that the towns or the regions that voted 'Yes' in 1980 and in 1995 also have the right to break themselves away from Canada? Surely not.""   Partition is illegal due to municipalities being entities created by the Quebec National Assembly and therefore, the municipalities cannot hold referendum on separations, because they don't have any constitutional powers. The fact that municipalities don't have constitutional powers is recognised by the constitution act  Partition is an impractical solution, or is being proposed insincerely even by its advocates. being primarily an argument designed to encourage Quebecers to vote against separation in any future referendum on separation. Trudeau's 1980 observation that if Canada is divisible, Quebec is also divisible, was made on the eve of a referendum in which he was attempting to encourage voters to cast their ballots against secession. The first book on the subject, and the one which gave its name to the movement, was 1980's Partition, the Price of Quebec's Independence, by Lionel Albert and William Shaw. The title of this book makes clear its intention to use the threat of territorial losses to dissuade Quebecers from voting in favour of secession."

The same way there were Canadian MPs wanting to invade Quebec if it seceded, there would have been Quebec politicians that would talk about an invasion of Montreal. The question is simply who would have prevailed in the new Quebec parliament.  Basically, if Canada imposes harsh terms, even though they are legal, then the peaceful secession of Quebec can become violent, very fast.  Personally, I would think that Canada would try to sell Ungava to Quebec for an amount that (at least outwardly) would seem fair. There might be unrest in Montreal until it's given a semi-autonomous status by the Quebec government."

HistoryWhatIf,38rs4x,FPSlover1,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Considering the fact that there are less than 50,000 people living in Ungava, it very well could have happened. This is especially true if people were afraid of a civil war.   I think that the problem is that you aren't looking at what the people in power would get out of the different deals. The two groups with the most power would be the Canadian and Quebec governments. Montreal would not be united in this matter and the Montreal government would probably remain neutral.  So, Quebec would want to secure a future for the new country. They would need access to the Ungava riding's resources to do so. If they don't they have no future (as you discussed). The same is true for Montreal's financial resources. It would be very easy to spin a refusal of Canada to negotiate in good faith over Ungava (if that's even needed) as an act of aggression against Quebec.  Canada would want to preserve unity. They would most likely fight the referendum results in court and internationally. However, the last thing they'd want is a civil war. That would mean troops, people dying and others becoming angry at the government. It would make it impossible for Quebec to rejoin and might even boost independentist movements in the other provinces. So, the choice is negotiating (at the expense of 50,000 people and resources that have much less value to Canada at the time) or prepare for violence in some form.   For Montreal, Canada would obviously support a secessionist movement within the city politically. Quebec needs the city's population and financial center. To keep that, they need to keep the people happy which means that they might make huge concessions to the city, turning it into something that resembles a city-state. At this point, you would have a Montreal city-state with great ties with both Quebec and Canada. Montrealers would probably enjoy lower taxes as well as no FTA and free passage to both Canada and Quebec. They would most likely be using a canadian dollar and be able to have both Quebec and Canadian passports. At this point, why would you secede from Quebec and join Canada? What would you gain?  Now, all this is within 10 years of independance. What happens afterwards could be different."

HistoryWhatIf,38qtq1,lbyrne91,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:39:42 2015 UTC,"I will have a go:  the Caliph Umar sends out emissaries to all Jewish communities within the caliphate and outside with an invitation to settle in the Holy Land. The conditions of this are that they aid the Caliphate in its war against the Byzantine empire. The offer is accepted by many Jewish communities who begin migrating to Jerusalem and the surrounding environs. The first communities to arrive form a council and begin ratifying a treaty with the Caliph and his advisers on the boundaries of this new nation-state. Communities in Europe begin hearing word of this offer and begin their mass-migration to the Levant. Of course, the Byzantines hear this as well and edicts are declared authorising the persecution of Jewish communities and people remaining within the imperial boundaries. (im not sure if this is after Yarmouk, but if it is - the Byzantines cannot militarily prosecute this fledgling state) The Byzantines go further to block the Bosphorus to any European Jews, who now travel to North Africa via the sea, and through Egypt (recently fallen to the Caliphate). This process is slow, and the nation of Israel slowly takes shape. Jewish people occupy the cities of Phoenecia and around the Levant. It is around this time that Caliphate begins arming and training the Jewish army. This army proceeds with Arabic assistance to invade Anatolia, raiding and occupying everything south of the Taurus mountains. The Byzantines organise a force of levies and extensively recruits European mercenaries promising an easy victory. The Byzantines fight the relatively new Israelite army and defeats it, pushing them out of southern Anatolia and restricting them to the principle cities of the Levant.  This forms the boundaries between a lasting Jewish state, the Byzantines and the Caliphate. However, the policies of Umar do not last. The Caliphate becomes increasingly hostile to an upstart Jewish state that has become increasingly zealous of preserving its freedom. The caliphate wishing to maintain suzerainty over the cities and dominion over the kingdom they created decide that a war to punish the Jewish people is necessary. The war is a lengthy siege-by-siege process, the Jewish army fights well but is simply outnumbered and with the still small Jewish nation they cannot rapidly train new forces. Finally, Jerusalem is threatened and they sue for peace - an offer refused by the Arabs. The Jews look north to the Byzantines for aid but find them hostile. The Jews offer to submit to the Byzantines, allow them access to Jerusalem and offer the cities that they still control in Syria and Phoenecia. The Byzantines accept and capture parts of Syria and the Levant but are defeated before they can come to the aid of the Jewish capital.  The Arabs execute the council leaders responsible and place a puppet king in control of the weakened Jewish state. Which is bound by treaty to not resume arms, and is reduced in size and stature. They establish garrisons and begin trying to undo the work of Umar. However, it is too late and the Jewish population is to large to adequately redress the works of Umar. He is remembered as a kind but incredibly flawed Caliph.  The result is a small, quasi independent kingdom which exists until the crusades steamroll through. The Jewish population is larger and despite persecution from the Byzantines and the Caliphate continues to grow. The Jewish people still have a sense of nationalistic pride, and this leads to a restoration of a stable Jewish state in the long term, when the Caliphate weakens and splinters. The Byzantines see a restoration of Roman Syria - at least for a short while. It also gives them time to reform their military and taxation systems to preserve a more stable army (less reliant on foreign mercenaries). The Caliphate does not invade Anatolia as effectively as in the OTL, the defeat of the Jewish/Arab army weakens their desire for expansion into these lands. This could effect the arrival of the Turks, who facing a strong Byzantine state might be pushed into Arabic lands. Overall, the Jewish state while initially transient and defeated will remain a constant (in one form or the other) due to the massive population increases of the ""great Jewish migrations""  Hope that's okay."

I'm not sure how that could happen, but let's see about results.  If the United States develops a nuclear bomb in 1935, it is going to need a way to deliver it; at the time it has no bombers up to the task - the B-17 hadn't even had its first flight yet, and in OTL it was never considered in any nuclear capacity.  Given the appeal of using a super-bomb to keep America's enemies at bay, a large build-up the armed forces generally may get diverted into bombs and aircraft capable of delivering those bombs; its an open question whether the Navy gets a piece of that pie (aircraft carriers big enough to launch bombers big enough to deliver a nuclear bomb?  It's a tall order in the '30s, but if the Navy can't sell Congress on this, and they don't have the prestige of WWII under their belts, they might seriously decline in importance as a branch) or if some kind of rocket force gets going (if you don't already have a big long-range strategic bomber fleet, ballistic missiles might look like a more appealing thing to invent first).  The US might tilt more isolationist as a result, relying on a nuclear arsenal in favor of conventional force.  Eventually, ballistic missiles and bombers will be long-range enough that America doesn't need island bases in the Pacific Ocean - but I see no way short of magic that technology gets there between 1935 and 1942.  America is still going to want to have its bases for power projection, which means it'll have interests in the region, which means it'll still come to quarrel with Japan over Japanese expansion and imperialism.  Under this set of facts, though, the Japanese will pretty much have to knuckle under or bet the farm on an initial knockout blow, even more so than in OTL - any failure to completely thwart America's nuclear strike force in the Pacific would invite annihilation.  Maybe the Japanese would recognize this and buy time to build their own nukes with various concessions.  Maybe Japan would be roughly as flattened in late '42 as in OTL '45, just more radioactively.  If Stalin sets off an A-Bomb in August '39, and Hitler doesn't have one, Hitler is going to have to seriously re-evaluate his strategy.  His most ""in-character"" move is probably to tell his scientists to catch-up, and then proceed with his plans and hope to have his own nuclear arsenal before mid-1941 or so, when the Soviet Union would probably be ready to invade him / he would be ready to invade them.  His most rational move is to postpone and/or cancel the invasion of Poland and plead to the Western Allies for a defensive bloc against the Soviet Union.  Frankly, the Allies' most rational move is probably to accept!  That would result in something like the formation of NATO, except that some of its participants would be Fascists and Nazis...which, in Cold War terms, isn't necessarily a huge change - the most important part of being on the Western side of the Cold War was being anti-Communist, not being democratic.  The lack of any Western acknowledgment of the Holocaust (assuming it even happened to the same degree as in OTL) might mean no state of Israel, which means one less flashpoint in the Middle East, and the United States having less bad blood with certain Muslim nations."

One reason the US starts working on the bomb is to beat Hitler to the bomb and it took seven years of government shoveling cash on them in a no questions asked emergency project.   To have it done in the 1930s would mean that opposing Hitler isn't a goal here.   What we could do is have some kind of technological revolution in the 1890s that changes the course of technology thereafter. Let us say that in the 1890s some inventor comes up with the transistor and instead of the electronics that followed using vacuum tubes they used transistors. This would radically reduce the size, power requirements, and cost of electronics in the first decade of the 1900s allowing for much more rapid development of things. Electric calculators and type writers come out in this decade and in the 1910s (pushed by world war one) we get electronic computers.  The 1910s also see very cheap radio sets and push forward television by 30 years. In fact in the 1920s tv is out and about instead of radio. This will have radical social impacts with the Scopes Trial being on TV. It will have economic impacts that might change the course of the depression or prevent it outright which prevents Hitler from rising as he did.   During the 1910s we have people like Albert Einstein doing their math on early computers which helps make things go much faster. Nuclear science is advanced 50 years over where it would be with the exponential impacts of computers and even an early internet in the 1930s as computers are connected over phone lines.   With 1970s level computers being open to them in the 1920s people seriously begin doing work on nuclear fission and fusion and fission seems more reasonable at the time, so it gets more development.   Scientists demonstrate in papers in the late 1920s that they can get a fission chain reaction to start, but not enough for a power plant, or a bomb. Russian scientists working in the USSR are also working along this path under Stalin (assuming he still seizes power and not Trotsky).   Lets just say that there is a depression but it plays out somewhat differently and Germany actually falls on the side of soviet style communists so we have a west-east break down in Europe in the late 1930s.   The US demonstration in July 16, 1935 is being replayed across Eastern European television sets. eastern Europe is being pestered into the orbit of the USSR and Peoples Republic of Germany while Western Europe is looking to keep Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania out of this red menace sphere.

The Soviets call the American bluff and detonate a nuke in Eastern France where many of the French Soldiers were massing.   The US Fires on Moscow and Leningrad, it has built nine bombs here. President Whoever asks congress to declare war on USSR and Germany and the US joins in.   Germany and the USSR fall by the Fall of 1944 but not before the USSR managed to nuke Washington, New York, and San Francisco.   The post war reparations are horrendous as Americans have blood-lust. The post war trials are unforgiving and the USSR is broken up into over 30 small republics.   Technological development in the 1950s and 1960s on radiation clean up, environmentalism (the movement explodes in the late 1940s thanks to TV footage of burned ecosystems and humans, cancer ridden children and mutated babies) helps the USA and former USSR slowly clean up their former cities. By the 1980s the USA has almost fully de-irradiated their cities while Moscow and Leningrad remain monuments of vengeance.   Eastern France is also cleaned up."
HistoryWhatIf,38pq0u,Historyguy81,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:30:41 2015 UTC,"Leo Slizard conceives the idea of the nuclear chain reaction ten years earlier, around 1924. To fit the timeline, let's assume that the majority of nuclear scientific advancements are accelerated accordingly, each happening about a decade earlier. Germany starts off with a massive boon, due to the majority of the Jewish scientists who helped establish the Tube Alloy and Manhattan Projects having no incentive to leave the nation. America and Germany are the only nations with any actual progress in the enrichment of uranium-235. Progress is slow, however, due to little threat from the Soviets (and also no war to end). Eventually, Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP rise to power in 1933, prompting the majority of the Jewish scientists to flee to America and Britain. The German program is significantly slowed, while America receives a huge boost. More and more resources are allocated to the American project to develop a ""weapon to end wars"". Eventually, the Trinity test is conducted as a success in 1935 under the utmost secrecy. However, the USSR's Enormoz spy operation smuggles plans for plutonium-implosion bombs to Russia, which greatly accelerates their nuclear program. They test a bomb, also in total silence, in 1939, several days before war is declared in Germany.   However, Hitler retained an interest in nuclear weapons due to greater scientific realization in their destructive capabilities, and did not halt their development early on. The first publicly-known nuclear detonation is over Lwow, Poland, on September 20th, 1939. Not only does it serve as a testament to the might of the German war machine, it also acts as a warning to the Soviet Union. Smaller nuclear weapons are also used by Germany in France and the low countries to great success; the Weygand and Maginot lines collapse in mid-May, with the surrender of France happening by June 5th. Most of the BEF is annihilated at Dunkirk, as the majority of them are incapacitated by radiation sickness. However, the German army is also facing widespread radiation-borne issues in front line troops, most of whom captured the bombed areas on the same day. The Battle of Britain is short, with a nuclear bomb being dropped on London breaking British morale and the signing of an armistice with the German government (on less-than-favorable terms).  At this point, Hitler makes the mother of all tactical blunders and decides to invade Russia. The Luftwaffe nukes Leningrad and Minsk, but Hitler is shocked when the Soviets detonate a nuclear device in Konigsberg. The Nazi nuclear stock is mostly depleted at this point, while the Soviets use short-range nuclear artillery (like the US's Davy Crockett bombs) against Nazi ground attacks. The blitzkrieg never makes it past Belarus and central Ukraine before depleted morale leads to a complete collapse in organization by the end of 1941. The Red Army pushes through Central Poland in a bid to turn Berlin into glass.  Meanwhile, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, leading to the US retaliating, well... forcefully. The Doolittle Raid carries a nuclear payload, which is dropped on Tokyo on April 18th, 1942. Among the casualties are Emperor Hirohito and Crown Prince Akihito themselves. Japanese morale is shattered, with several members of the remaining Japanese high command committing seppuku rather than surrender. A seven-year-old Masahito is crowned Emperor, and an interim government signs the treaty for surrender on May 1st, 1942. Meanwhile, the German government surrenders after Hitler commits suicide in the wake of a nuclear shelling on August 3rd, 1942. The entirety of Berlin lies under the control of the East German puppet State, which now also includes the valuable Kiel canal. America's hegemony on the world is a bit weaker, Russia's iron grip over Eastern Europe is a bit tighter, and the Cold War is a whole lot hotter."

Assuming that Hitler still rises to power (Lenin and Trotsky might support German Communists better which could prevent Hitler's rise) World War 2 could world out very differently for the USSR.  If the Industrialization is more even in the 1920s then by the time war maybe coming there could be a whole different load-out for the Soviet war industry.   Lenin or his Heir in the 1940s might not have the guts to grind Soviet soldiers into thick red paste to stop the Nazis. On the other hand, a more charismatic leader wouldn't have wiped out Soviet officers and the Nazis could have been smacked in early 1940 rather than 1943.   In fact without Stalin in power, the post war period wouldn't have been filled with Soviet betrayal and there may not have been a Cold War at all.

Tecumseh manages to return in time for the Battle, and defeats William Henry Harrison's fighters, killing Harrison.   1812   James Madison claims the conquest of Canada will only be a matter of marching, and invades. However, under the leadership of Sir Isaac Brock and Tecumseh, The British and their Native allies defeat the American invaders at every turn with the Battle of the Thames resulting in the complete annihilation of the American invasion from the East. British invasions in 1814 at the end of the Peninsular Campaign and the Napoleonic wars in Europe targeting the Michigan Territory and Ohio in the west, and Vermont and Maine in the East. Despite an American victory in the Battle of Lake Erie, Tecumseh's forces raid the south shores and force the American army to abandon their bases on the shores, marooning the Lake fleet without supplies. Washington and Balitmore are attacked as in OTL, and further successful British naval landings in Charleston and New Orleans by 1815 result in a total American capitulation.   When peace comes in 1816, British North America cuts off access to the Great Lakes for the Americans, sees the establishment of Tecumseh's tribal Confederacy as a British Puppet in Michigan and parts of Ohio and future Wisconsin, denying the Western Lakes to American encroachment. The St. Clair River defines the Western boundary of British North America and Tecumseh's Confederacy as in OTL. America is also deprived of Maine, which joins the future Atlantic provinces alongside most of Northern Vermont and New Hampshire. Most dreadful of all losses, The Louisiana Purchase, is recognized as an illegal transaction, as Spain was the true owner, Napoleon had no right to sell it to the Americans. Louisiana is returned to Spain on this basis, in exchange for a large sum of cash.   With the rebellions going on across Spanish America, Spain is unable to really put much effort in holding anything beyond New Orleans, which itself has started to identify as an American stronghold despite its loss to Britain. After a rebellion there, and in St. Louis, the Louisiana territory is essentially American in all but name. Similar to OTL Texas.  In 1819, with the Spanish doing poorly, and America somewhat recovered, America declares war on Spain and helps to cut off Spanish royalist supplies to the New World. American campaigns are aimed at taking Cuba and Puerto Rico, as well as securing the Mississippi river at St. Louis and New Orleans. These campaigns are successful, and by 1820, Spain has ceded Louisiana and Puerto Rico back to America. However, A combined British/Native force has rolled into Iowa and Illinois, and has seized those territories for British North America and Native population. This results in the dominance of the Southern Slave economy thanks to Senate votes. Agriculturalism is a strong force in the United States.   ...More later."

New York divides into Long Island and Albany, Missouri admitted as a free state, Cuba, Louisiana, Arkansas, Admitted as slave states. Despite division of New York, slave states outnumber Free states. 1830: Britain officially outlaws slavery and slave trade, putting pressure on increasingly southern-dominated United States. Increasing pressure within the United States comes as fights for more territory for Free States come up empty while Slave States dominate the Senate. 1836: Texians revolt with America declaring war on Mexico. Texians win Battle of Alamo to seal the victory with American cavalry help. Texas joins as Slave state. 1838: Tecumseh dies, his heirs start civil war, Confederacy collapses. America and Britain back different candidates. With power vaccuum, Britain moves into Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. America moves into southern Indiana. 1840: Native Confederacy proxy war flares into conflict between Britain and America. In a war lasting three years, both of Tecumseh's heirs were killed, and the territory of the Great Lakes was annexed outright by Britain, as the allied state. America made moderate gains in Indiana and the west, but campaigns into Canada were fiercely resisted for two years. Stalemate; British strategic victory. 1849: Inspired by nationalist revolutions in Europe and their own competence in self-defense during the 3rd American war, Canada becomes independent as the Dominion of Canada. The provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Michigan, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Maine and New Hampshire joined. Within the next six years, Oregon, Cascadia, British Columbia, Manitoba, Illinois, Red River, Prince Edward Island all joined as provinces with the promise that they would be connected via railroad. All other British North American territories fell under Canadian jurisdiction immediately. 1857: Indian Mutiny against British in India. Northern states call for strike. South narrowly defeats motion in Senate. Harper's Ferry in 1859 spurs abolitionists to action. 1860: Tensions come to a head. Jefferson Davis is elected President of the United States, causing the Northern States to rebel and become the Confederacy of Free States. After a quick attack by the CFS under General Sherman, the United States forces under Generals Lee and McClellan win at Antietam and push their way into Pennsylvannia by 1862. Washington is abandoned by the Confederate garrison, and the Confederate war capital is established at Philadelphia. Thanks to the industrialism in the North, and Britain's supplying of the north over the border, the Free States win at Gettysburg and re-establish the Mason-Dixon line as a boundary. Despite losing Delaware and West Virgina, the Confederacy of Free States becomes independent of the United States, frequently to be referred to as the Slave States by 1864.   ....More tomorrow."

I think that it would take a lot more time than I have to do it. What I really enjoy about /r/historywhatif is that it gives me an opportunity to exercise my brain while I work on other projects that involve creating histories. This is more for fun then anything. I appreciate the offer of help though.  Here's the rest, at least as I see it going.   1861: French adventurism in Mexico begins as in OTL, with Napoleon III attempting to establish Maximilian of Habsburg as his puppet Emperor of Mexico. This war does a great deal to drain Mexican strength. Despite Maximillian's victory, a major guerrilla conflict begins in the countryside, that the French are ill-prepared to defeat. 1865: The Confederacy of Free States and Canada under the long-serving Louis-Joseph Papineau establish reciprocity agreements in the face of a coming economic downturn caused by the split from the United States. President Davis denounces what he views to be British intervention in American affairs. The first peacetime election in the Confederacy of Free States sees Abraham Lincoln of Pennsylvania rise to power. Successfully galvanizing the Confederacy in the face of Union raids across the Mason-Dixon, Lincoln drew the Confederacy closer to Britain. 1867: After an election, Canada elects John A. MacDonald to the Prime Ministership, leading the Conservative Party on a platform of finally completing the Trans-Canada railroad. The railroad runs from Gaspe, south along the St. Lawrence, across the Detroit River and south of Lake Michigan through Lakota treaty territory. John A. MacDoanld's party also guarantees a 2nd route going north of Lake Huron through the wilderness. After a time with the capital established at Bytown, the capital of the Canadian Dominion is officially moved further south-west to the quickly growing city of Chatham, deep in English territory on the advice of Queen Victoria. This ignorance of Quebecois opinion is spurred by the far heavier English-speaking majority of the settlers, who are largely concentrated around the Great Lakes. The Frontier city of Chatham quickly grew into a worthy capital, economic heartland and railroad hub between Detroit on Lake St. Clair, Toronto on Lake Ontario, Sarnia on Lake Huron and with the trade routes across Lake Erie near the Rondeau Bay naval and shipping center.  1870: Gold discovered in the Mexican territory of California. Settlers come from all over North America and Europe, but they are predominantly English speakers. Fearing a similar rebellion to that of the Texians in the 1830's, Mexico tries to ban their entry, but is unsuccessful, as though Maximilliano remains in power, his support from the French has largely dried up after Napoleon's fall at the hands of Bismarck's Prussia. 1876: The Southern line of the Canadian Pacific Railroad company is completed at a ceremony in the Province of Cascadia. This connects the western network running from Vancouver in the North to Portland in the South with the Eastern networks. This greatly speeds cross-country travel, and settlers begin to fill the native-held lands of northern Mississippi basin. Tensions begin to rise between the remnants of Tecumseh's Confederacy and the Dominion of Canada. The northern line of the CPR has reached as far as Thunder Bay on Lake Superior, but has yet to connect Manitoba and Red River to the rest of Canada. 1878: Oil is discovered in large amounts in California, which further pushes tensions between Mexico and the English-speaking states in North America. In a rare alliance, the United States of America (despite its own Texian oil wealth) and the Dominion of Canada (with the consent of the British Parliament) declare war on Mexico. The Royal Canadian Navy is officially formed (from the disparate volunteer services like the Pacific Flotilla, Atlantic Flotilla and the Great Lakes Flotilla. Old British sailing ships are commissioned as its main force. Though outclassed by Mexican naval vessels, the Canadians were successful in aiding the invasion of northern California through Oregon. In the Battle of San Francisco Bay, Canadian vessels laid down a withering crossfire on Mexican ships trying to exit the bay and destroyed much of the Mexican Pacific fleet. With that defeat, California, which relied on shipping for supply, was mostly cut off from Mexico and lost to Canada. American forces were less than successful, however as the bulk of the Mexican Army was able to fortify the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers. An American invasion of the Yucatan, and an occupation of Veracruz, were much more successful. However, the war caused the collapse Maximilliano's regime at the hands of Republican rebels. By 1880, the Second Mexican Republic is established, and peace is achieved. Alta California and Nevada are ceded in their entirety to the Dominion of Canada and Britain, while Colorado, and while the Americans manage to hold their positions in the Yucatan and take Colorado and Arizona for their own, their border on the Rio Grande does not budge, much to the chagrin of the Slave States.   1881: The United States (Slave States) annexes the Central American Republic, and admits Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua to the Union as states. Plans to build a canal through Lake Nicaragua to become the ""Suez Canal of the West."" In response, Britain purchases Panama City from Colombia in 1883, and assigns the territory to the Dominion of Canada. Rival canals begin construction. 1885: North-West Rebellion begins. A Native coalition attempts to declare independence under the auspices of a renewed Native Confederacy. Tribes like the Lakota, Cherokee, Shawnee and the Comanche all rebel against the Dominion government. With the northern rail line almost completed, the Dominion army is able to respond swiftly and crush the rebellions, despite their being spread across the North-West territories, Manitoba, Red River, Minnesota and the newly created Dakota, Alberta and Montana provinces. By 1887, the last of the Native rebels are hunted down and killed by Dominion troops. Other natives escape, to take up residence in the American Indian territory of Oklahoma. 1894: With the growth of Dominion military power, and its burgeoning population, Canada attempts to repatriate their constitution and become an independent state. With Statute of Edinburgh in 1896, The Dominion of Canada becomes independent in terms of legislative power. The Dominion of Australia, which to this time has seen an increased immigration from OTL as well, also repatriates their constitution by 1899.  1900: A Referendum for the Confederacy of Free States to join the Dominion of Canada is sees 60% vote Yes, especially in the face of Union expansion. With that, the northern Confederate States cease to exist, and join the Dominion of Canada as provinces.  1902: With the Nicaragua Canal 95% completed, a slave revolt begins, which forces the United States Marine Corps to put down the revolt in a bloody conflict. When news of this slave massacre reaches mainland America, a general slave rebellion based on the tenets of Communism begins, with black Americans (predominantly field hands) taking up arms against their masters. Large cities like Atlanta, New Orleans, Memphis, Havana and Richmond are all set alight by revolting slaves. By 1905, the revolt is put down, but the black population, representing a significant minority of the American population, is given concessions, resulting in the official end of slavery for the next generation of blacks. However, the distraction of the slave revolt saw Canada complete the Panama canal finished in 1903. Though British owned, the tolls for using the Panama canal proved a significant boon to the Canadian economy. Other British Atlantic territories were soon joined to Canada including Newfoundland, Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas and even Bermuda was added to the Dominion of Canada. However, the Nicaragua canal is eventually completed, the Panama Canal proves to be easier to navigate, and more successful. 1907: First heavier-than-air-flight achieved by the Silver Dart in Nova Scotia. Aeroplanes are immediately explored for aerial reconnaissance capabilities by the British, Canadian and American militaries, with other European nations soon following suit.  1914: The Great War breaks out in Europe with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist. Canada declares war on Germany and Austria-Hungary one week after Great Britain. The Canadian Expeditionary Force crosses the Channel. Over 3 million Canadians would eventually cross the channel (out of a population of 110 million) and join the fight against the Germans. But, in 1915, The United States would join Germany in declaring war on Canada. Trench warfare in Maryland, Arizona, Indiana and southern Illinois would prove a distraction for the Allied war effort. However, by April 1917, another Communist slave rebellion would begin behind American lines, which severely hampered American efforts and forced their surrender in November 1917. Germany would surrender in July, 1918 with a Canadian troop surge doing a great deal to bolster Allied efforts in Europe.   ...I was hoping that I could finish more, but this will have to be enough for today. Canada is almost a superpower, but there's still some further work to be done."
HistoryWhatIf,38nraj,RandomFlotsam,8,Sun Jun 7 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"War of 1812 goes down and the Federalists at the Hartford Convention manage to take New England out of the Union. The US and UK sign a white peace in 1814 and battle of New Orleans in 1815, not too much is different, but for the rest of the 1810s there is tension along the border of this new country.   Without New England involvement in the Politics of the US, the Republican Party in this period stays much more Jeffersonian than Whiggish meaning single party rule continues.   Jackson wins in 1824 since Adams is politicking up in The New England Federation and Henry Clay has lost a great deal of his ideological support. Clay becomes part of the Republican loyal opposition without enough support to start his own party.  Jackson destroys the bank in the 1820s rather than the 1830s and the economic crash of 1837 happens instead in 1826 but by 1828 it has subsided enough that he easily wins re-election.   The New England Federation is industrializing rapidly using Federalist/Whig economic practices while the United States is more or less agrarian except in New York and Philadelphia which is more merchant with dusting of Industry. New York and Philadelphia help transport southern cotton to the New English textile mills and everyone is happy.  Without the pestering of New England moralists, the Compromise of 1820 doesn't need to happen and Slavery is generally opened to all territories. The Negro Exclusion acts in the old North West Territories (places from modern day Ohio through Wisconsin) are in place but are slowly over turned.   Slave holding becomes an accepted norm by enough people in the USA that the antebellum pro and anti slavery debate doesn't happen nearly as divisively.   New England is legally and constitutionally anti slavery how ever, they don't mind all the cotton grown by American slaves. New England ties closer and closer with the newly confederating Canada. forming a pact of friendship and trade.   However, the old north west and the middle states, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Illinois, are caught between two competing culture sets. New English/Canadian merchant industrialism or Dixie planter economics.   Their tradition of small family farms which is influenced by New English memories of many of their original families and a steady influx of New English immigrants looking to have a chance at a farm of their own is causing cultural tensions.  New English immigrants are also moving into Canada because they also have wide open lands. But because Canada is already slavery free there are far fewer tensions.   In the 1830s American colonists in Texas, heavily supported by president Polk (1836-1844) throw off the rule of Santa Anna and with American support claim the full extent of their ideal Texas. Santa Anna gets enough support to fight the Americans and loses horribly.   the US now controls land out through the Pacific Coast (actually taking Baja and the northern bits of Sonora and Chihuahua)   This expansion worries the UK and the New English and the conflict over Oregon heats up. Many Americans eager for the 54'40 boundary of Oregon actually go to war, after all they just whipped Mexico.   the Oregon War of 1841-43 is an unmitigated disaster for the US.   They are forced to cede California back to Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Western Montana become part of the Dominion of British Columbia, and the old North West secede from the Union and join New England, who was allied with the British and are in effect a Dominion in all but name.   Mexico goes through several civil wars and the Californios of California break away again taking what would now be California, Baja California, Nevada, and parts of Arizona into their new Hispanic republic. The Gold Rush provides a demographic problem for them but they use violence to maintain cultural dominance and when the gold rush slows down in the early 1850s the population is still 75% native american and 12% Hispanic Californios.   British Columbia is Confederated into Canada in the 1870s about the time that the Russians try to sell Alaska and the UK buys it up to help their Russian friends.  Canada is industrializing in a race with New England but just has access to more resources than New England does.   Canadians call New England their little buddy while the Americans are struggling in the late 19th century with increasing slave revolts and a brain drain as non land holding whites just move to New England, Mexico, or Canada.   in the early 20th century the government of the USA falls when a coordinated series of Slave Revolts, funded by Anti Slavery moralists out of New England, Canada, and the UK manage to sneak in repeating rifles and canned food and an army of escaped slaves, maroon colonies, and outside mercenaries and advisers help General  Martin Daniels of the Free Negro Army lay siege to the White House and execute President Franklin.   With the President dead and the congress on the run the Free Negro Army attempts to put up a new Government but General Daniels doesn't have the ability to work as an administrator and his short lived Junta collapses as he is unable to secure national control.   Many sections of the country also under black rule refuse to acknowledge him and many sections are able to stay out from under black domination. What follows is twenty years of the most brutal genocidal infighting the world had ever seen.   Gangs of people would kill anyone of the opposite skin color. People fled from this mess into the near by countries and the infrastructure was devastated.   This was overshadowed by the break out of ""The Great War"" in 1912  and the UK, Canada, and New England allied with Germany and Italy fought a three year long war against France, Austria, and Russia which ended in a negotiated peace. France would relinquish claims to the aslace-Loraine for all time and Italy would regain Italian lands in Nice. Russia and Austria would liberate the Balkans puppet states, the Ukraine, the Baltic States and Poland into German ""protection"".  France fell to a communist coup in 1916 and several communist attempts around the world also rose up. Most notably with in the American Breakaway republic of Georgia.   During the troubles in America several ""break away"" republics emerged Including Dakota which was dominated by Black-Indians mixed race plains Indians and African slaves, Georgia which includes most of the old south, and Texas.   The Free Communal Republic of Georgia implemented Marxist Communism in 1917 and formed a public alliance with France.   While much of the rest of the world was recovering from The Great War, France and Georgia saw a competing paths for Communism. In France there was a great deal of fighting and purging of resistance, their colonial empire was aflame as Algeria and Vietnam resisted communist policies.   Georgia, on the other hand, being used to plantation economics took to communism very quickly. each plantation was made common and common industrial development happened.   by the mid 1920s France had fallen to yet another civil war and a Monarchy emerged, but Georgia was now the strongest and richest of all the old USA republics and was forming an Hegemony over what was left of the old USA putting it at odds with the Alliance of Canada and New England who were staunchly in favor of old style Market Capitalism.   The Second Great War started when Georgia launched an invasion of California to regain the ""Historic Holdings"" of the US. New England and Canada jumped to the defense of California and a huge battle front from Philadelphia to San Francisco emerged.   For seven years a slow back and forth war raged across North America with Europe taking sides along Ideological boundaries as a proxy war.   Eventually the Canadian, New England alliance got to Atlanta and forced a surrender and in 1943 the Georgia Hegemony was broken up.   Canada is the dominant power in North America and outside the Russian Republic and Republican China, the most powerful in the world."

You list nationalism - but probably economic control of agricultural lands, the petroleum (want decreased competition for West Texas crude) and other mineral resources in the lands of California (plenty of copper and gold in those lands) is a great secondary(primary) reason to go to war.  The question I might have would be: how is the rest of the world's economy doing post Great War?  Were there un-payable reparations in play?  The scenario you spin makes it seem that there's probably a better overall economic situation in post WWI world, because somehow Britain and Germany were allies in the thing.  I'd imagine that the European conflict would have been over quickly, relative to OTL, instead of the meat-grinder affair that the Western Front turned into.   And, without that horrible stalemate as a historical reference, a war of conquest might still be viewed, mid-20th century as still a legitimate political option.  So yeah, no reason for Georgia not to invade a neighbor for fun and profit."

The scenario you spin makes it seem that there's probably a better overall economic situation in post WWI world, because somehow Britain and Germany were allies in the thing.   The reason the UK and Germany were allies was based on the UK and France being much more antagonistic in this Time Line because of colonial competition across the world. Germany was ethnically and religiously more aligned with the UK and the racial politics of the 19th century would play into a Germanic Protestant union vs the ""vile"" ""papist"" Celts of France.   Italy escapes this because of reasons that don't make logical sense in racial politics but their position in the Mediterranean as a counter point to France.    I'd imagine that the European conflict would have been over quickly, relative to OTL, instead of the meat-grinder affair that the Western Front turned into.   Because France is facing a two front war, the war is much more mobile, mobile military tactics are quickly deployed rather than trench warfare. Things we would call tanks evolved out of armored cars which were developed actually in the conflicts across the USA as hit and run guerrilla fighting with machine guns were the standard tactics.   Millions did die as chemical weapons were more commonly used, again thanks to the bloodbath going on in the USA, but the war turned out to be a whole lot more ""heroic"" than world war one in our time line did. People who died often died in heroic deeds rather than in a shit filled tench.  The romance of war was tarnished, not evaporated.    So yeah, no reason for Georgia not to invade a neighbor for fun and profit.   Georgia, while being run mostly by dark skinned people of ""pure negro blood"" whatever that means to the communist-nationalists of the era really want to reunite the USA because the ""the black man built this"" and they blame ""the white man"" for it breaking apart, and who is whiter than Canadians?   They joke that there are more Canadians than are reported because they blend into the snow.   So Georgia forms it's hegemony over Texas, and the Ohio territories and fights a stalemate war with the Dakota region and invades California which is basically the Danzig analogy for our time line.   They don't actually need the resources, they have a racial nationalism to achieve. Their resources are already pretty well secured with trade with Latin america."

He implements his NEP which uses Marxism to justify creating ""fully developed capitalism"" in Russia before true Marxism can take over. Russia/USSR embarks on a very strange state driven pseudocapitlism which creates rapid industrialization across the 1920s developing fast enough that it can actually help prop up post war Germany and help them stabilize their economy.   1930, June: the Great Depression kicks off with a series of global tariffs designed to stabilize the economy after the wall-street shenanigans.   The USSR's proclaimed ""Communism"" is really working great. for the first time in their history they are exploiting their natural resources and producing industrial and consumer goods and actually edging toward what many believe is what Marx envisioned.   Trotsky is running things now and he has cross continental railroads, investor-commune owned industries (each employee is a shareholder and appoints their own executives in a collective style corporation) and the standard of living is rising while in Western Europe and North America it is crumbling due to the depression.   FDR is elected in 1932 by a land slide but his cabinet and advisers are much more communist and he implemented a great deal more collectivization which is met with far less resistance since it clearly is working in the USSR.   1920s-1930s Germany: the USSR has a great deal more resources to fund the German communist party. Adolf Hitler dies in a shoot out and many of his Nazi party associates are run down or out of Germany. Communists by 1933 have a majority of the German Reichstag seats and being implementing ""Soviet Style"" communism (which in this universe means psudeocapitislism collectivization)  There is no major arms development in Germany, no jingoism, no nationalism. World wide we see a general spread of Communist ideas out of the USSR or home grown as we have in the USA.  In the 1930s in the USA the American Communists are inspired by Lenin and Trotsky but not actually following their lead, they are more traditional Marxists backed by the IWW and other Marxist thinkers who escaped Europe.   FDR nationalizes the banks, rail roads, radio stations, creates a national medical system, a national work board ""to put america back to work"", and creates a whole collection of government operated industries. Henry Ford loses a court battle with the feds and Ford Motor Company becomes US Motors.   FDR is voted out of office in 1940 without the threat of world war 2 looming. By this time the Republicans really cannot oppose these government changes and the party is much more of a Teddy Roosevelt Republican rather than a Coolidge or Goldwater party anyways.   Over the next 50 years the Dems and Republicans just try to outspend each other and fight on how to run the collective factories or farms.   While in the USSR the ""owner operated"" communes which had been operating effectively morph into what we know as Corporations right now. By the 1990s the USSR and the Arabian Federation are the two richest countries on earth with very high per capita earnings. Meanwhile the president of the USA, some guy named Nader, keeps threatening to nuke Mexico unless they start selling the USA oil again."

The potato blight hit all over Europe, meaning smaller yields of potatoes. This increased the price of those that were produced. Any potatoes that would be produced (from you different strains) would be going for export. The farmers that could not produce anything would still starve. During the famine oats, wheat beef and pork were still exported. If the blight hit Ireland in any form some people would end up starving.  If there was no blight at all Ireland would still have problems. It had a very high birth rate, a high unemployment rate and most farmers did not own the land they worked. Land owners were usually English or Scottish and never in the country, Irish and English managers charged tennet farmers large amounts to work the land and the system was going to hit a rough patch further down the line. Even if there was no famine there would certainly be a few lesser famines in later years.  The lack of a famine would have had a huge impact on the UK. For a start the famine was used to help scrap the corn laws. These laws were set up to limit the amount of grain imported from Europe to Britain, this kept prices artificially high (good for the landed gentry). The famine showed that if the cost of staple food was to high, starvation would follow. The scrapping of the laws allowed cheaper grain, which led to cheaper bread, which led to lower factory wages, which led to industrial expansion. Another affect would be the emigration of Irish to England and Scotland. Though the mass emigration to America is more famous, more Irish moved to the industrial cities of England and to a lesser degree Scotland. This helped Britain become the industrial powerhouse it was in the late 19th century.   Long term I dont know how it would play out for Ireland. It would have a large population, tied to the land, with many of the population unemployed. I dont see industry growing there as it did in mainland Britain (no middle class and everyone but the poor is making to much from agriculture). I dont see home rule moving forward either."

The government has a pretty huge advantage given that they control an experienced army and most of the members of the party have experience fighting revolutions. However, this is prior to China's economy really taking off, so the government will be constrained by the extra costs that come from fighting a war.   The rebels will need some outside help, fortunately President George H.W. Bush, hoping to distinguish himself from Ronald Reagan, provides that aid. Somewhere between airlifting weapons to Israel and supplying the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, supplying the pro-democracy Chinese rebels evens the military playing field.   Eventually, feeling that both international pressure and the rebel forces are boxing him in, Deng Xiapeng agrees to transition power to a democratic government, on the condition that he and his advisers are pardoned.   As a result of the war, China is far weaker, but will eventually rebound. President Bush is even more committed to operation Desert Storm now, but will probably still lose to Clinton for the same reasons in OTL.

The political structure was the British Empire - a dominion was a country such as Canada which had a very high level of self-determination within the Empire. While the UK got very short of foreign exchange, it did not go bankrupt.  If there had been more money available, the biggest change would have been that the UK would not have surrendered the veto on the US use of the atomic bomb in exchange for a loan [Richard Rhodes, History of the Atomic Bomb]. This could possibly have stopped the Cold War escalating at the strategic level as much as it did - however this might lead to an increase in the number of proxy conflicts, particularly in Africa, between the UK and the USSR, with minimal involvement of the USA. This might well lead to an alliance with France for the purposes of defending African colonies. The conflicts would not necessarily be popular revolutions - the Malayan Emergency and the Mau Mau Uprising are examples of a minority political group trying to seize power by force.  India would have progressed to greater autonomy, but would probably have been partitioned into several smaller units, rather than India and Pakistan. It is unlikely that a single country could have worked because of the religious divide, and it would be wise to avoid the current problem of two large and antagonistic states. The smaller countries might have progressed to dominion status eventually, but at different rates.  The likely outcomes are a somewhat reduced role for NATO (because the Cold War doesn't go quite as far, and the UK and France concentrate their interest outside the NATO area); a larger conventional army for the UK at the expense of the Royal Navy, and perhaps no Polaris; increased air transport capacity to ferry the army to operating bases through Africa which would normally be lightly manned; and probably an eventual resolution along French lines - i.e. a common currency area in Africa, and a set of UK-aligned states which are largely self-governing, but with UK military support when needed."

Should the USSR considered Israeli use of nukes grounds for a dessant (air- and sea-bourne landing), as some argue that even conventional escalation might have precipitated, I think that the American response would have hinged on American casualties or damage to American interests in Israel.    If the Soviet response would have been nuclear, there would have been no doubt that the US would have felt the need to assert a level of deterrence in response to a Soviet expression of aggression by nuclear means.

And what also of the US response to Israel going nuclear?  Or possibly even France and Britain?  Israel could definitely survive initially, but I see the potential for mass international intervention, potentially through the UN.    Who would be leading this intervention though?  I don't think you could have seen US, USSR cooperation at this point in the Cold War.  And this was around the US's low point in power during the Cold War at the end of Vietnam, so I seriously doubt there would be any Truman-esque resolution railroading going on.  And of course, the Soviets had very limited support on the UN security council.    That could lead to major gridlock in the UN, whichever side championed international intervention.  Considering things again, I'm probably bringing up a somewhat unreasonable scenario, because the use of nukes would probably discourage any intervention other than air (which was far more limited in capabilities than in the nineties ala Bosnia) or nuclear intervention, with the latter quite possibly escalating to MAD, which no would want.  The possibilities from this what if seem absolutely fascinating (possibly even a POD for a real Cold War WWIII), but I'm honestly not sure how things would have played out after an Israeli nuclear strike, other than that they would undoubtedly be dramatic."

Speaking of the moon, we probably wouldn't have made it there in the 60's, and we might not have made it until decades later because there was no competition with the Soviets.   Without nukes, North Korea would be a far lesser threat (assuming no unification after the Korean war) and Iran would not be a matter of international concern. U.S. allies would be effectively immune from attack, since any attack on NATO or Israel would carry the threat of nuclear retaliation.   Anti-American sentiment would, however, skyrocket outside the United States. Terrorism would have become a national security concern way earlier than the 1990's, and the U.S. would definitely have passed an even more restrictive PATRIOT Act or equivalent in the interest of national security.

This probably means no space program and a much slower development of computers (as the Minuteman missiles and the Apollo program drove miniaturization).

Probably they would be less costly in the long run to develop, produce and maintain.  Nuclear weapons were seen by the US as the counter balance to the Soviet advantage in troops and tanks.  The US knew that it could never possibly field a conventional army to protect Europe from a Soviet invasion, should they decide to launch one.  The Soviets saw the US's nukes as a terror-weapon, one that they had no defense against, should those crazy Americans decide that they need to expand their Manifest Destiny all over Mother Russia.  So of course, the Soviets would have to come up with something to counter US nukes.  I'd expect that the Soviets would work to make some really clever delivery systems for aerosolized liquids.  That's how you deliver most chemical and biological agents.  I'd also expect that they'd make great advances in the study of meteorology and climate, because once you deploy your cloud of chemical nastiness, you are at the mercy of the prevailing winds.  You want to maximize exposure for the enemy, and minimize the chance that your forces will be exposed.  So we could have the Soviets starting their space program even sooner than OTL, so that they could have and retain an edge in weather forecasting.

Maybe a Protestant Kingdom of Northumbria could be established, but it'd be a long shot. Eventually, a ""Peace of Westphalia""-like treaty is signed."

With the English crown in dispute between York and Lancaster, a clement to the French throne would probably enter the mix.   But wouldn't the War of the Roses have been averted by victory over France? I mean the 100 years being over and the cost to the nobility would be removed and Henry VI might not have had weak rule with a French queen at his side.   The strong ties between the French clergy and the Papacy would almost guarantee Henry VIII gets his divorce (assuming he needs one).

Cannae showed that no matter how badly defeated Rome was in the field, the only way to win was a siege of the city. The biggest reason why Hannibal didn't defeat Rome was because he didn't have enough supplies to sustain a siege on the city, and this was while Carthage had allies in Southern Italy and had allies like Macedon shipping in men and supplies. As time goes on Carthage's potential allies are just going to dwindle as Rome conquers them until it's 1 on 1 and I don't think Carthage could win that fight."
HistoryWhatIf,38ddmk,SirN4n0,2,Wed Jun 3 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree with your point. The comparison of the two empire's military structures would indicate that the Romans would always have an advantage at least in it's ability to sustain itself from consistent defeats. The citizen soldier is more likely to continue hostilities over the foreign mercenary.   In this timeline, without hostilities arising from the Mamertines, the inevitability of conflict is lessened. There is nothing stopping the Carthaginians and Romans from establishing honourable trade and cooperative treaties. During the Mercenary war, Rome acted with great honour in refusing to assist the rebels or the rebellious cities of Utica, and the Sardinian territories (until the very end and then it occupied Sardinia). So for the sake of argument the first Punic War doesnt happen - the major implications of this  the aggressive hannibalic war or second punic war is unlikely to happen. Carthage never loses Sicily, Corsica or Sardinia - the last being a dishonourable seizure on the Romans part.  There is no mercenary war and Carthaginian hegemonic power continues to grow in Africa and on the trade nodes of its empire. So my theory is that if the first war is avoided all together by the Fabii policy of non-aggression, Rome and Carthage could exist at least for a time as trade partners as the two super powers of the Western Mediterranean."

It is curious to know how their empire would develop if they didn't immediately come into conflict with Carthage. I mean Richard Miles said in his documentary, Carthage: the Roman Holocaust, that Carthage provided Rome with the blueprint for her imperial designs (Romans also learnt to be an inclusive rather than hegemonic power). If the punic wars don't happen immediately, perhaps, the Romans would not be as initially successful in absorbing the various cultures you described.   Again, as you said, war was (despite historians hating the term) inevitable because they were natural competitors in the western Mediterranean. The Romans were incredibly adaptive people so it's natural that they would eventually surpass Carthage, absorbing useful ideas, designs and inventions. Literally giving them the edge, and as was clearly shown by the first two punic wars, militarily superior to their punic counterparts."

HistoryWhatIf,38bgk4,Rabada,5,Wed Jun 3 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"I'll try and make two separate cases, one for each character in power.  Let's start with Himmler: the perception of him that I have is him being a madman just like Hitler, only more prone to plotting. For this reason I don't think the war would have changed much, since he would try to control the entire army, without having much knowledge about it nor having at all a contact with reality, just like Hitler did. Furthermore, shortly after Hitler's death, he would start a purge amongst every high official or politician he disliked, with the excuse of finding out the ones who organized the coup. This would probably lead to an even faster german defeat. Just as in real life, he would try to plot for a dignified end of the war, without any success.  I think the situation would change if Rommel came to power, somehow avoiding all the influences from the likes of Goebbels, Himmler, etc. Of course he need the July plot to succeed and definitely the two persons above either arrested or killed.  I see Rommel as less, or not at all, influenced and convinced by the party propaganda and ideas. Therefore I think he would pursue what was, probably, the objective of the whole plot, an immediate surrender, at any condition.   Meanwhile the war against Japan keeps raging, with the SSSR that decides not to try and invade from Siberia, preferring to consolidate their presence in Eastern Europe, in order to have guaranteed in the peace treaty a large amount of territory.  German soil is still pretty much unoccupied by the allies at this time, so it's likely that the peace term won't impose a territorial division like in OTL: Germany has to do a complete demilitarization and pay massive war reparations; as of territories, the only thing that changes from OTL is that a free Poland survives and is also handed all of its northern coast (Prussia).  The cold war still happens and Germany is the key battleground for the two sides: each one's goal is to have a government loyal to his side. Free Poland is immediately influenced by the SSSR. NATO amasses a huge quantity of soldiers at the borders with Germany and the soviets do the same thing (using Poland); the Maginot line becomes an important asset for the Nato and it's constantly improved and modernized.  Germany doesn't flip to the Warsaw pact, largely because the NATO influence is too big plus the SSSR is not able to offer them a better alternative of the Marshall Plan. A key turning point in the cold war will be when, after establishing a german pro-NATO government, the NATO will start to locate military bases on german soil, despite a previous agreement between the two sides that forbid anyone to station there any kind of military force.  This violation will bring the world on the brink of a nuclear war, but ultimately the Soviets, estimating the gap in military technology too high, prefer not to generate a global conflict, but rather keep trying to install a pro-communist government in Germany, even trying to provoke a revolution.  In the end the Soviet Union comes to an end similar to OTL."

Stauffenberg also trusted him.  It was only him who didn't see anything political about himself. But as Juenger said they needed a naive man to make it have even a slight chance to work. Because the people in powers, Nazi and Allied knew too well about their own kind. They would've known how to deal with a true politician.

EDIT: He had been contacted by plotters and would likely have willingly joined the new Germany, but still was not involved in the actual assassination attempt in any way and none of the leaders of the plot wanted him in charge of the whole thing, they just thought it would've been nice to have an active field marshal on their side.

Misch  Juenger's quote is from his Strahlungen, which is repeated by Mitcham here. source  Recently declassified tapes show that General Eberbach was overheard by British spies saying (before the  assassination happened.) that Rommel wanted to have Hitler assassinated  ; full doc with multiple historians' opinions. One of the plotters, Gisevius, who apparently didn't like Rommel at all (he didn't sound like he wanted to join the pro Rommel campaign admittedly was widespread at the time, when Germany sorely needed a Hero, a Father Figure), confirmed that he knew about the assassination plan and ""proposed to us to have Hitler assassinated, and then, if possible, Goering and Himmler as well""Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 12.  As for being inexperienced, yes, but humanity have jumped to the inexperienced in their own moment of madness since forever. Maybe Rommel was not great at party building (so was General De Gaulle who I remember uttered to one of his close associates that ""Stop bother me with your party!"") and the traditional ""essence"" of ""politics"" namely dirty scheming. However he always did a very good job of dragging public opinion and affection (including that of the enemies' leaders and soldiers) towards him, and that was something very valuable when the Resistance needed a respected public face and Hitler was still very popular with the German people. He was naive and mad/quixotic, that's right, but being naive and mad meant being unpredictable. Hitler and Goebbels allowed him to rise to that level of popularity at the first place because they thought he wouldn't cause any harm to them later and that they could control him forever. The Allied leaders wouldn't trust someone who looked like a seasoned politician.  Certainly such men sound unacceptable to us who are living in peace time. Different times need different breeds of heroes, and different breeds of heroes have different downsides.

The military governor of France and also one of the plotters, General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel was heard cried out Rommel's name repeatedly in delirium after a failed suicide  Tague. This led to the Gestapo and Hitler thinking that he had to have quite a role in this whole business, and then they discovered other details.  Also even in 1943, apparently Hans von Luck (it was in his memoirs called Panzer Commander, too bad I cannot find an internet version) arranged a secret meeting between Guderian and Rommel, who both didn't like the situation Germany had led itself to at all. Unfortunately von Luck couldn't hear what they actually talked about.  The commanders in the West including the SS ones supported him anyway Bennett  Apparently this Dietrich-Rommel conversation in which Dietrich said he would obey only Rommel was from Rommel's aide Lang Brighton  Wiki says the following about Bittrich:   According to German historian Heinz Höhne, Bittrich vowed to support a plot against the Nazi regime on 15 July 1944 when he met Erwin Rommel and promised that he and his troops were at Rommel's disposal if the Field Marshal so requested, but like many he warned that Hitler had to be removed from power first."

The July Plot's objective was killing Himmler and Goebbels as well. Had only Himmler survived there would have been civil war. But the thing was that the plotters counted on the naive assumption that they could make a separate peace with the West and then fought Russia together. But it's known the Allied would have accepted nothing but unconditional surrender and the division of Germany had been decided already. There were plans to demolish Germany as a country as well (but then later the Cold War dynamics changed everything and it was clear that an unstable zone in the middle of Europe would benefit nobody). So even if they could have somehow kept the army and people in a coherent, unified state, it would have been hard to deal with the Allied Nations. And thanks to Goebbels' propaganda many in Germany were still under the impression that the war could be won. It was complicated and really hard to guess..  After the last days: Himmler would've get trialed and executed. For Rommel becoming Chancellor that could only have happened had he fallen into a deep coma after being struck by the Allied air attack and Hitler judged him to be harmless enough to keep alive. And then suddenly he waked up  after the war had ended. Then considering his personality, he would've refused to have anything to do with politics. But maybe they could've somehow persuaded him though. And the West would've liked him since: 1.He was enormously popular with the German people and the West's soldiers  - that prestige they also needed since they wanted the Germans and their own people to keep calm and have belief in ""The Good German"" myth for the benefit of all. 2.He was quite pro-West in attitude. As for Stalin, maybe he would've supported too because Rommel would've looked terribly naive and manipulatable, moreso than say Adenauer. Why do you think Hitler and Goebbels judged it was safe to allow him to become a propaganda hero who was popular as Hitler in the first place?  Had he been Chancellor, well, at least I'm sure he would've given a fight over East Germany. And I'm also pretty sure that his style would've proved quite authoritarian. He had a bunch of energy, hated lazy people (whether military or civil) and was very individualistic. He was no sly politician but he usually dragged people kicking and screaming with him quite well while keeping the warm side for normal people, barefooted soldiers and foreign people.

According to the testimony of his companions, the Prophet was accosted and even assaulted multiple times by the Disbelievers before they attempted to capture and defeat him at Badr.  Without the faith of the Greatest or the leadership of the Prophet to unify them, the Arab tribes of the Peninsula remain as they were throughout the rest of history - listless, semi-nomadic, squabbling over pastoral lands. (The Muslims call this the Age of Ignorance for good reason.)  The Arabian Peninsula goes on to develop a large number of sultanates and emirates differing from patrilineal heritage and religion. Some are Christian, some Jewish, even fewer are Zoroastrians - most of them will claim the henotheistic and patriarchal pre-Islamic folk religion of the Quiraishi. Mecca will remain a major pilgrimage site for these pagans.  How does this impact the West?  In our timeline, innumerable amounts of priceless manuscripts and works from Ancient Greece, Rome and Mesopotamia were translated into Arabic, copied and diffused amongst the numerous caliphates in the Muslim world. This essentially ensured that algebra, advanced mathematics, philosophy, medicine, astronomy and other scientific advancements would survive, since they were being spread to the opposite ends of the Mediterranean.  In this differing timeline, most of these priceless works are gone forever. Without records of the ancient world to inspire.and rejuvenate learning in the west, the Renaissance does not happen. Advanced achitecture, art, applied mathematics, democracy and every other major development made since the 15th century is aborted.  Without the rise of the Ummah, the Byzantines and Persians will squabble and fight intense wars and stalemates for centuries. The Arab tribes are used as proxies, agents and mercenaries for their constant wars. Egypt remains Coptic in both religion and culture.  The influx of the Seljuk Turks in the 10th century will sweep through the weakened Persians and penetrate deep into Asia Minor, crippling the Byzantines. The Seljuks will court both Zoroastrian and Christian missionaries, much like the Mongols did.  Iberia would most likely be host to a number of Visigothic and Basque tribes and warlord states/petty kingdoms. Charlemagne would work on bending the Iberian tribes to kneel in the 8th and 9th centuries. The Battle of Tours does not happen. With no mortal enemy to fight, Christianity grows complacent and squabbles heavily on the inside. Clergy and kings fight to impress their own thoughts and ideals on the faith. Instead of one large schism between east and west, one would see a number of sects differing from realm to realm. They would disagree on matters such as poverty vs. opulence, iconography vs. iconoclasm, the divine nature of Christ, clergical inheritance of estates, tithing, etc.  The world as we know it is changed in a profoundly negative way."

It's hard to tell, really, what would have happened, but the unifying factor and desire of ""one true church"" isn't to be dismissed so easily, IMO. Perhaps, if the other patriacat aren't so weakened by the muslim conquest, the bishop of rome will simply get a position of ""first among its peers"" and things will not go until the schism.

Without the British occupying them, it is possible that the two will join voluntarily to secure trade. If the UK invades and manages to hold the Northeast and New York, its possible that the US would of broken up into several countries. However them holding those areas is unlikely.

Many mammal species were wiped out, fish species too, and reptiles, plants, and single celled life also took hits to their diversity.  The problem is that when dinosaurs were discovered they were identified as ""Something else"" and not as the ancestors of birds. So naturally, as ""Something else"" not being here now, we assume they died out, as a flock of birds flew over head.

A military government made up of Prussian officers would probably seek armistice with the western allies in return for dismantling the SS and the freedom to continue fighting against the Soviets.  Whether or not this is granted is another matter.  If the SS replicates the night of the long knives in 1944-45 by decapitating the army, then expect Himmler or Heydrich to expand brutality at home with the bitter and violent end of a 2 front war already inevitable.  If a civilian option emerges in the wake, the Western allies would be considerably more amenable to surrender with conditions than with army officers or the SS.    I don't see any of these options boding well for Germany in the postwar world, but any of them in 1944 that would be able to make peace would spare Germany the Soviet gang rapes and reprisal killings seen in their 1945 occupation."

THe first thing to consider is what the mongol invasions did. They conquered a huge expanse of the world, the largest of all time. This means that they created a single entity under which people traded. In other words, they created trade routes from east to west. These eastern good were almost entirely the whole reason for western colonization and exploration atleast initially. The other part of the world the mongols changed forever is persia, prior to the mongols Persia was one of the richest areas in the world with a huge population, grand cities, rich and vibrant culture. This was all destroyed by the mongols. And the last area that was changed forever was the people of the Kievan Rus. Before the mongols, they had a huge empire, a large army, and were rich with trade and actually fairly numerous in number. The reason i dont add China is because the Mandate of Heaven basically made the mongols the new rulers that the chinese had to accept and their history didnt change too much.  I believe the biggest change would be the kievan Rus. With a strong Orthodox ally to the North, Byzantium might not fall... And without connected trade routes the black death could just be a chinese only disease. Sparing the world, but keeping europe in the cult of poverty for much longer.

The Ottomans could also use this as a base of operations against the Portuguese. They fought several wars against the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean, the horn of Africa, and even in what is now Indonesia. An island in North or South America could be used to harass Portuguese shipping and raid their colonies.  However in the long run they will not be able to hold onto any colony. They have no access to the Atlantic, and so it would make it a long voyage to resupply, which in a time of war could be costly. It would be very easy to form a blockade at the entrance to the med.

HistoryWhatIf,382zfl,ForgingIron,12,Mon Jun 1 14:06:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, lets look at the facts:   -Czechoslovakia was given the Moldauhafen (Czech Vltavský přístav) in the Hamburg Harbor at the end of the Elbe as its entrance to the sea that it could reach via boat from Prague after World War 1. The rent was settled in 1919, but the harbour given to Czechoslovakia in 1929 for 99 years (it will be transferred back to Germany by the end of 2028).  That effectively means that Czechoslovakia would be able to sustain overseas trade and colonial exchanges with its colony of Togo (lets call it that, not good at thinking of Czech names) all by itself from 1929 onwards. Until then, it would have to pay Germany or its respective occupation forces for harboring rights, as Czechoslovakia is after all a landlocked country.  -Czechoslovakia had 13.6 million inhabitants in 1921. Let's assume this number is correct and let's ignore minor changes up and down. 3.1 million of these were Sudeten Germans and would be lost in late 1938 to Hitler Germany.  -Togo had, according to German colonial officers, around a million inhabitants in 1912. Now this is a bit of a far stretch over the Great War and all, but let's also assume this number is correct.  -This would mean that 13 million motherlanders would stand to 1 million colonials. That is a very good ratio and would definitely imply that the Czechoslovak government would be able to sustain the colony with tax money and colonial officers.  -Now, the colony of Togo was worthless. From an economic standpoint, it was never worth it for the powerful naval and industrial power of Germany, hardly was for Britain, and hardly would have been for Czechoslovakia.  Conclusion:  This brings us to the turning point of Czechoslovakia, involving a dude named Adolf Hitler - you might have heard of him. Togo would not be annexed into Germany, but occupied by neighboring Britain and France. And from there on, the history of Togo, which would most likely not be transferred back to the Czechoslovak SSR (cause communism and imperialism arent exactly friends), will pretty much be like OTL."

The Numidians would still pose a threat to the Carthaginians in North Africa but without having to pay any war tribute to the Romans, the Carthaginians would easily push them far enough inland to ensure that they would not be a problem. I imagine Hannibal, or his descendants, would attempt to conquer southern Gaul to connect their Iberian and Italian possessions by land. I'm imagining this land grab (if successful) would lead to future conflict with the Gaulish tribesmen. From here, Carthage continues expanding into Gaul with relative ease, outwitting the Gauls, who abide by a warrior code of honor, with deception tactics.   History as we know it would be completely rewritten for Western civilization. Latin would not be the base language for many Western European languages, Carthage would probably continue conquering and in the future become an empire on the scale of the then-future now-past Roman Empire. The base language that would evolve into contemporary Spanish, French, and Italian would be the Carthage dialect of Phoenician / Punic and the Latin alphabet (which anyway took inspiration from Phoenician, or at least indirectly through the Greeks who did) would be lost to history.

I'm going to assume that the rise of Rome in the Mediterranean happens the same as our timeline and the Romans find Celtic civilisations in the Doggerland area. In order to colonise this large and prosperous area the Romans set up a regional capital along one of the rivers in Doggerland and start sending over much more settlers than they did in our timeline. Overtime this city prospers and becomes held at the same level as Rome and Constantinople, possibly even serving as the capital of the empire at one point. When the empire is divided it is cut into the Western Roman Empire (mostly Doggerland), the Central Roman Empire (The Western Roman Empire in our timeline without Northern France) and the Eastern Roman Empire (the same as the one in our timeline). The Western Roman Empire survives the various threats that approach it but with many of it's regional cities and provinces becoming large and powerful it begins to fracture creating something similar to the Holy Roman Empire by the early Middle Ages.

The hardest part of the partition is making it last. I think Greece could have held Smyrna and Thrace (with Constantinople as a free independent city) if they focused on fortifying the area and creating some sort of anti-Turkish alliance with the other nations in the Balkans and Caucasus. By WW2 things are going to start to get messy.  By this time Armenia is probably no longer independent and split between the Soviets and Turks. Turkey itself is probably going to be bursting with nationalist revanchist sentiment and I don't think that Britain would be able to offer them enough concession to stay neutral, which gives way to the idea of Turkey joining the Axis. This would give Hitler the extra base of operations he'd need for Barbarossa as well as jeopardize British operations in the Middle East.

Couple that with the Mandate for Palestine, and you can see that the formation of a Jewish state in that particular location was pretty likely.  Did the Holocaust improve public feeling towards the idea of a Jewish state where those most harmed by the Nazi atrocities could (theoretically, at least) live in peace and safety? Almost certainly. Would there have been a push to found a similar state in the same place even without it? I would argue yes; there just would have been a larger Jewish population in Europe as well."
HistoryWhatIf,37xjyv,EstherHarshom,1 point,Sun May 31 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the funny thing about this thread...the ""Holocaust"" (aka Holohoax) never happened. I'm going to tell you all how this is possible:  “To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.” ~Voltaire  Why is it that we allow the filming of tales of hearsay and publish fictional novels , knowing full well that if one were to do some very simple research would clearly see that the National Socialist Third Reich was nothing like what has been force-fed down your throat in grade school. In-fact, when one sees this blatantly obvious lie that is the Holocaust, one finds it absolutely absurd to consider that we as a Nation haven’t learned the truth yet.  To the few people among mankind who value truth and responsibility, WAKE UP! For the past seventy years the entire world has been brainwashed by the Bolshevik and Zionist World Order to believe this lie; their agenda, to secure their illegally seized throne of power by completely securing the Jewish Race, culture and identity from being destroyed. This includes the truth behind Adolf Hitler and His Struggle (solving the Jewish Problem and ensuring humanity's last chance for true freedom comes to fruition)!  The Holocaust and the countless lies it has created must, and will be, exposed as nothing more than Jewish propaganda! The Six Million number was a complete fabrication; if one looks at The World Almanac for 1940, evidence shows the world’s Jewish population at 15,319,359. In 1949, the number of Jews in the world rises to 15,713,638. Notice there was no decrease, revealing a lack of an alleged “gassed Six Million Jews”?   In Auschwitz alone, it was cited by a Soviet document of May 6, 1945, and officially acknowledged by the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, that four million people had been systematically murdered by the hands of National Socialism. In 1989, a revise to this number had been made, making the current number of dead at Auschwitz around one and a half million (A STAGGERING 2.5 MILLION DROP IN THE SIX MILLION NUMBER), yet today it is still argued that Six Million Jews still perished in this alleged Holocaust. Furthermore, there was no single document or orally transferred order authorized by the Third Reich, nor Adolf Hitler himself, calling for the Final Solution of the Jewish Question with the usage of gas chambers. In-fact, many documents can be found showing that there was a massive epidemic of Typhus and Typhoid over all of Europe in the later months of the Second World War. Remember those piles of emaciated bodies? The piles of hair, glasses, shoes and clothing? It was known in the United States and the Third Reich that the treatment for such diseases called for very stringent procedures to ensure complete sterilization, mainly the fumigation of clothing and other articles possibly hosting lice. The shaving of hair was also another precaution taken, which included in Auschwitz a shower, in designated rooms known as delousing rooms (propagandized as “gas chambers”). Zyklon-B was a common pesticide used at the time for these purposes, it also contains the poisonous gas hydrogen cyanide.  To this very day, one can see the dark and clearly evident Prussian Blue stains made by usage of hydrogen cyanide bleeding through the brick walls and remain visible both inside and outside of these buildings. Archival footage openly shows, that there is absolutely no sign of such chemical to be found within the “gas chambers” inside the Auschwitz concentration camp. In-actuality, the Auschwitz museum staff admitted on tape that the holes in the roofs in this building are reconstructions, built by the Soviets after the war. These holes are made crudely; hardly up-to-par with the modern and sophisticated engineering skills that Germany is renowned for. The ruins of the “gas chambers” inside Birkenau also reveal no stains of hydrogen cyanide, and the holes visible are clearly seen to have been made with the same rough designing. Do you remember the many other rumors regarding tattooed human skin, lampshades made from human skin, shrunken heads and bars of soap made from Jewish Fat? These are also pure lies, and have been officially admitted by the Allies themselves to be as such. Yet, even today, there are those who still insist seeing Jewish prisoners having their skin ripped off before their very eyes.  To support this evidence I have provided, a scientist by the name of Fred Leuchter Jr., an expert in the area of execution with gas chamber facilities, was ordered by a Canadian court in the late 80s to go to the Auschwitz camp in Poland, to do the first on-sight forensic research in the history of the Holocaust myth. His results, enforced by scientific logical fact, showed that it is an absolute absurdity to even consider the possibility, that those facilities could have been used for the purposes of executing civilians on a mass-made, top-secret scale (these buildings were mostly made from brick-and-mortar, open glass windows, brittle glass light bulbs, flimsy wooden doors with locks on the inside). One might add this: had the Germans not all gassed themselves to death, they would have certainly blown themselves to bits from the heat of a light bulb, or the smallest spark from the crematorium fires (which was yards away from the “gas chamber”).  These facts have been long suppressed from the world for many decades, until quite recently (in the mid-late 80s). For those curious enough, I would invite you to read Dr. Nicolas Kollerstrom’s new book, Breaking the Spell: The Holocaust Myth and Reality (2014).  Some of you will call me anti-Semitic, a racist/neo-Nazi, and an even smaller few will have the utter gall to say I’m an advocate for violence. The fact of the matter is you are all wrong. Answer this question for me: Since when should the research of historical events be considered a federal offence? In most of Europe, merely questioning the “official” Holocaust story (that is, in a civilized manner, NOT one of violence) gets you a prison sentence.  George Washington said: “Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light.” Ladies and Gentlemen, let the words from our Founding Father speak as evidence for the start of a New Dawn for the United States of America, and one day, the rest of the world. The Truth Fears No Investigation!"

Churchill, who became prime minister the same day the German offensive started, would have been responsible for Gallipoli AND Dunkirk. After defeating France a few weeks later, the Wehrmacht appears to be invincible and a new British Government has no choice but to ask for peace negotiations.   In the unlikely event that the UK continues to fight, it suffers from a shortage of troops.   Anyway, the Germans will most likely commit even more than the OTL 3 million troops to Operation Barbarossa or they manage to liberate Egypt and the Near East.

In particular, the British might focus on naval and air power since few avenues of land attack were available.  Perhaps North Africa is approached differently, and fought defensively with an eye toward containment of Italy rather than a real offensive test of arms for British infantry and armor in the desert.  In other words, the British keep the Italians from invading Egypt, but go no further.  This might mean no famed Afrika Korps, and Rommel gains his reputation in Russia or not at all.  Alternatively, assuming Japan attacks Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941 as historically, North Africa might be fought in earnest through 1942-43, with Germany not intervening until Vichy and Italian Africa is pacified and Italy herself is threatened.  This might make the Italian campaign a tougher nut to crack given that Germany had spent their time and resources in Russia rather than propping up the Italians on another continent.  The way I figure it, Italy still falls, but with significantly more troops and materiel than historically at Axis disposal, it's a hard slog lasting well into 1945, and only really disrupted by eventual Allied success in France.  This is due to the defensible nature of the Italian hills and mountains as well as the home field advantage afforded to Italian troops and their German allies.  Germany still loses, but totals of British dead are higher than historically.  Probably something similar for US, ANZAC, Canadian, British Indian, and Brazilian as well, given the length and difficulty of their time in Italy."

Making it to the beach and enveloping the British are two different things though. To do that they needed to move on the British in force.   The trailing units were running out of fuel and munitions and strung out over hundreds of miles of roads. The Germans could have made the beach but they were not able to force a decisive engagement and apply overwhelming force once they got there. German doctrine in WW2 was very clear on these regards, they did not attack piecemeal.   If you go back and check your sources you will find that there just weren't enough Germans within 10 miles of the beach to defeat the large amount of still armed British waiting there to be evacuated. The Germans did the right thing by ordering a pause and regrouping.

Kleist's Panzers were no longer supported by infantry and had taken 50% losses, a staggering amount. The area around Dunkirk did not lend itself to tank warfare and going in without the cover of infantry and artillery would have been suicidal. The forward German commanders wanted to run for the beach just to say they wore the first German units to the sea, but it was actually Kleist, von Runstedt's top armor commander who requested a short pause to regroup and reconnect with supporting infantry units.   Organized British units that still had mortars and machine guns would have been quite effective against what von Runstedt had available to him when the pause order was given. Remember, these weren't the Panzer IV's and Tigers the Germans fielded later in the war, they were much smaller, lighter tanks. Without support and with large British units all around them they were in a pretty tenuous position.   People love to armchair general this one and what-if all sorts of possibilities that might have occurred by ordering Panzer divisions in to smash the British on the beach but these were divisions in name only. They were exhausted, running out of supplies, badly beat up, deep in enemy territory with no cover on their flanks--and the British and French were starting to at least attempt to organize counterattacks, there had been a failed but fairly large scale one the night before."

On May 24, Guderian was 30 miles closer to Dunkirk than the bulk of the BEF and no significant combat forces were in Guderian's way. Any ad hoc opposition that Britain would try to erect were no more likely to engage the Panzers than the garrisons at Boulogne and Calais. The BEF was already heavily engaged and did not have the training, doctrine, nor command necessary for such a heavily improvised operation."
HistoryWhatIf,37ua2o,backgrinder,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"Your idea presents 2 paradoxes. First off, Guderian can't be 30 miles closer to Dunkirk than the nearest large British formation because that formation was in Calais which is almost exactly 30 miles from Dunkirk along the coast road. So he is closer than other British units, but not closer than the nearest British fighting formation. The unit (or units) included anti-tank batteries armor and infantry just landed in France.   The second paradox is this: If Guderian attacks Dunkirk, who takes on his original job, which was attacking those same British units in Calais, which he did irl on May 24? There was no one else available, which means Guderian in launching himself at Dunkirk instead of Calais leaves the back door open for those British units to run up the coast road and relieve Dunkirk, hooking up with other allied units falling back to Dunkirk in the process.  You say those British units would be unlikely to engage the Germans but they did fight them at Calais and held them off for 3 days in spite of being in a hopeless situation and under very heavy air attack.   You really think they would have sat on their hats and refused to fight at Dunkirk instead if left to their own devices? Or that high British Commanders would not have ordered them to move to protect Dunkirk if they were sitting there 30 miles from the battle with a regiment of tanks and an anti tank artillery battery?   All sending Guderian to Dunkirk accomplishes is having him fight the same British troops he fought in Calais anyways, but this time on the defensive in a place where they can be rapidly reinforced by other units moving into Dunkirk over the next 2-3 days and in a position where they are fighting for a chance to return home instead of go into a German POW camp.   I don't see how the German  position at Dunkirk is improved by failing to consolidate their own forces on the one hand and by failing to seal off British armor and antitank weapons that were 30 miles from Dunkirk and pulling them into that part of the fight on the other.   Having Guderian cut off the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment in Calais and giving Kleist time to regroup and get support from trailing infantry heavy units still seems the most logical choice of those available to German commanders imo. Remember, just winning a footrace to Dunkirk does the Germans no good. They were trying to envelop all the allied forces, and that means they needed to be able to account for all of those forces (even the British in Calais and French in Lille) and attack them in force."

The Reformation means that Europe was disunited with its own squabbles (more than usual) so it's not certain that, after the fall of Vienna, even Catholics could have concentrated to hold back further Ottoman conquest.  In a sense, Catholics (the Hapsburgs in Austria/Spain) would have to divide their focus between the Ottomans in the East and the emerging Protestants in the north.    If the Ottomans focus on Europe (instead of other parts of their empire), they take modern Austria, Czechoslovakia, southern Germany (Bavaria), eastern Germany/Silesia.  If the Spanish/French/English don't unite against the Ottomans but instead keep fighting amongst themselves, then the Ottomans could swallow all of German-speaking Europe."

My thinking is that the various intelligence services in NATO would quickly work to destabilize the new French government before it could do too much damage through a combination of smear campaigns and covertly arming/training counter-revolutionaries within France.

I think it would be important here to identify some changes that would allow this coup to succeed. In 1933 FDR was at the height of his pre-war popularity.   Butler would need to be able to gain control of enough support from a very limited supply to overthrow not only FDRs supporters, but the supporters of the system in general.   In order to do this we have to maybe have Hoover go even deeper into government directed recovery, higher taxes, higher regulations, meaning that Hoover pisses off enough people with failure that when FDR wins there is already a cadre and core of anti-presidential forces.   When FDR breaks his promises to reverse course on Hoovers plans and instead enacts the New Deal which doubles down on Hoover's mistakes this group would be organized enough to seize various locations of federal power in DC, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston, San Fran, Hawaii, Manila, and Houston.   Then we get our own military dictatorship who is fascist, and white, and buddies up with Hitler, plays on America's racism and starts doing evil things to people of darker skin tones, and the combination of the USA and Nazi Germany has the technology, man power, and resources to conquer the world.   However the conquest is hard to maintain simply because lots of people really don't want to live under dictators, and even though unspeakable genocide is going on, these regimes are doing much of their terror internally putting down a civil war and they crumble.   Historians will claim that world war 2 ended in the 1960s with the final collapse of the Fascist Regime in the US when forces of various resistance bands laid siege to the capitol and white house and the leader was arrested, executed, and tried."

South Vietnam was already leaps and bounds ahead economically of the North. There are anecdotal reports of NVA regulars being astonished at the sight of refrigerators when entering houses in Saigon. There was an emerging manufacturing industry with foreign investment, and the service industries, which largely depended on a large foreign presence, thanks to the Americans, could have transitioned under the right economic advisors.

For one thing, you're better off in the southern hemisphere than the northern one for a couple of reasons. One, as far as I know, all of the cold war nuclear powers were (and still are) north of the equator... there's a very low probability of any southern hemisphere countries getting nuked.  Second, most winds/air currents move in an East/West direction. I believe that there would be far less fallout/radiation in the southern hemisphere. A lot of dust would make it into the oceans and currents would eventually distribute it around the globe. But this would take a few years and some of the isotopes with shorter half-lives would have burned out.   The third reason in favor of the southern hemisphere is climate. If predictions are accurate and an all out nuclear exchange results in a nuclear winter... you want to be somewhere warm. Southern hemisphere wins again since the overall climate is warmer there.   One last factor in favor of the southern hemisphere is infrastructure. I'm thinking about electronics and communications in particular. Much, if not most, electronics will be wiped out in the northern hemisphere due to the EMP effects of multiple nuclear blasts distributed across broad geographic areas. Don't expect a lot of TV, radio, computers, power transmission or even the internet to survive in the northern hemisphere. The military will be better off due to their having EMP hardened equipment.  In the southern hemisphere, computers, TV, radio, power stations etc. will have a much better chance of not being affected by EMP.   Considering all these factors, I would pick South Africa. Why? For all the reasons previously mentioned plus one other factor.   Independence. All those years of apartheid sanctions led the South Africans to develop a very self-sufficient economy. Energy, medical supplies, food and all kinds of manufactured products... you name it, the South Africans can do it on their own."

All the bombs dropped on all the cities during World War II amounted to some 2 million tons of TNT — two megatons. Coventry, Rotterdam, Dresden and Tokyo — all the death that rained from the skies between 1939 and 1945 — a hundred thousand blockbusters, two megatons. Today, two megatons is the equivalent of a single thermonuclear bomb — one bomb with the destructive force of the second world war. But there are tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The missile and bomber forces in the Soviet Union and United States have warheads aimed at over 15,000 designated targets. No place on the planet is safe.  The energy contained in these weapons — genies of death, patiently awaiting the rubbing of the lamps — totals far more than 10,000 megatons; but, with the destruction concentrated efficiently, not over six years but over a few hours. A blockbuster for every family on the planet; a World War II every second for the length of a lazy afternoon. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed 70,000 people. In a full nuclear exchange, in the paroxysm of global death, the equivalent of a million Hiroshimas would be dropped all over the world. And, in such an exchange not everyone would be killed by the blast and the fire storm and the immediate radiation. There would be other agonies. The loss of loved ones; the legions of the burned and blinded and mutilated; disease; plague; long-lived radiation poisoning the soil and the water; the threat of stillbirths and malformed children; and, the hopeless sense of a civilization destroyed for nothing. The knowledge that we could have prevented it and did nothing.''   Carl Sagan"

According to armscontrol.org (link below) Russia and USA each have a little under 1600 strategic nukes, plus a whole bunch of warheads awaiting deactivation. The nuclear minors (China France Britain Pakistan India and very probably Israel, although they like to play coy) have about 1200 between them.

The upshot is that you could probably kill most of that 48%, dropping multiple warheads on large cities, but after that you run into diminishing returns really fast. Using a nuke each on some 300 guy villages in the ass end of nowhere isn't going to add much to the kill count before you run out of bombs.

He probably would have taken all of western Europe, maybe Arabia (at lest the coastal parts), and perhaps tried India again, but with better planning.   During that time he likely would have continued his Alexandria building (imagine Alexandrias were Florence, Milan, Paris, Toledo, Medina, and Marrakesh are today), and he would have worked to spread Greek language and culture across his empire. In the last five years he would have worked to see his son Alexander gain the tutelage in Greek and Persian culture and he would have worked on binding the elites of all his conquered people together into a huge Hellenistic civilization with roads, common governance and the like. He would have basically brought together all the civilized people west of India and east of the Atlantic at this time.   Now, if his son has the same Charisma as the father, this empire endures. If Alexander created a system of government rather than just his power of person, then the empire endures.   If Alexander fails to impart his heirs with the proper charisma or create a system of government that is larger than the emperor then after his death the empire breaks up.  However, an expanded Hellenistic world radically changes things. It prevents the Roman empire because Rome becomes so Hellenized as to end up really different. The inclusion of Arab merchants into the Hellenistic world gives them access to the Sahara about 900 years before our time and they can take their camels and link the gold mines of West Africa with the Indo-European civilizations which develops the West African kingdoms much sooner and expands globalization. This would be done not with islamic missionaries, but with Hellenistic cultural motifs.   Europe and European developments are far more Hellenistic.  This makes me wonder about the rise of Christianity and it's connection to the decline of the Roman empires in the 4th century. If Europe is run by several competing Hellenistic political units then Christianity, assuming it starts at all, doesn't really become a universal system. Much of Christianity is derived from roman government systems, without those systems Christianity stays a much smaller mystery cult rather than a cultural power house.   With the Arab cultures hellenized I wonder about Islam being any different.   It is possible that the God of Abraham would have spawned only a few dozen cults and be part of the great AfroEurasian Pantheon rather than be the dominant deity."

At the time of his death (which was rather suspect but not unheard of in antiquity) there was already growing tension between his veterans and himself, Alexander styled himself more along the lines of a Persian Shahanshah than a Macedonian king. His ostracisation of his traditional support base would mean that he would have to dedicate at least some time securing the support of the many nations that he had conquered. While it can be said that Alexander's Hellenic empire was an attempt at unifying the east and the West, we cannot know how the people of bactria, transoxiana, media and Mesopotamia would respond to a foreign rule (without a loyal macedonian/quasi native army to support it). Yes, Alexander did focus on civic building,  on marriage alliances with the native populace and securing ties with the nobles of the region by not restricting their involvement in the politics of empire. The establishment of Macedonian hegemony, however, would force Alexander to become inwardly focused to establish lasting peace, to do this he would still require substantial forces to garrison the provinces to maintain loyalty and to assume that Persian and Macedonian Satraps won't rebel when he leaves Babylon. It would also require lasting change at a ideological level to accept cooperation between conqueror and conquered (observe the Roman methods of conquest, while conquest might be swift the process of romanisation was slow). Alexander would have to devote substantial time cultivating his ideology of panhellenism to indoctrinate a vast body of peoples that the empire he established was mutually beneficial (even this assumption implies that he could do this in such a way as to ensure stability following his death). Also keep in mind the sheer size of the land he had under his control at this point, it would be difficult for any ruler no matter how capable to keep an empire of this size running smoothly. If he continued conquering, perhaps the power struggles of the diadochi would begin in his lifetime."

HistoryWhatIf,37i9j7,PowerOfGamers01,38,Wed May 27 20:54:09 2015 UTC,"Vice President George Bush is sworn in as the 41st President of the United States. He selects Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to be the new VP and retains most of Reagan's cabinet, though he eventually replaces Alexander Haig with Henry Kissinger for Secretary of State.  Bush's domestic policy is similar to Reagan's in OTL, but more moderate. He still cuts taxes and regulations, but not to the extent that Reagan did - remember that during the 1980 GOP primaries Bush criticized Reagan's supply-side views as ""voodoo economics."" Instead he adheres to monetarism, which leads to him cutting spending alongside taxes. The economy still recovers from the early '80s recession, albeit a bit more slowly. Domestic oil production is expanded. Defense spending increases, but not as much as OTL, and there is no Strategic Defense Initiative. The combination of less radical tax cuts and a smaller military buildup means the U.S. government doesn't run up huge deficits like in OTL.  Bush is less welcoming of the Religious Right, which prevents them from becoming such a huge influence on the Republican Party. Overall the GOP will follow a more reasonable, less reactionary form of conservatism.  Foreign policy is less confrontational and more pragmatic. Some things remain the same: the invasion of Grenada still occurs, and the U.S. still supports the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. But Bush is a foreign policy realist, which leads to him being more diplomatic when dealing with the Soviet Union. With a more reasonable person in the White House, the Soviet Politburo brings Gorbachev to power in 1984 (a year earlier than OTL) after Andropov's death.  Bush is elected to a second term in 1984 on the strength of the recovering economy and the military success in Grenada. It's not a blowout like Reagan's reelection in OTL, but he still wins by a comfortable margin against Democrat Gary Hart.  Bush's second term is largely dominated by foreign policy. He and Gorbachev hold a summit meeting in 1985, which leads to earlier INF and START treaties in 1986 and 1988, greatly reducing Cold War tensions.  The 1988 presidential election is won by VP Bob Dole, who narrowly defeats Ted Kennedy. Dole's presidency sees the end of the Cold War from 1989-1992 as Communism falls in the Eastern Bloc and Germany is reunited. The Soviet Union survives, however; butterflies prevent the August 1991 coup from occurring. This allows Gorbachev's New Union Treaty to be implemented, transforming the USSR into a less centralized, more democratic federation.  The Gulf War occurs largely as it did in OTL, boosting Dole's popularity. However, the early 1990s recession still occurs as well. In 1992 Dole loses reelection to Democrat Mario Cuomo.  The Cuomo presidency scores several accomplishments, such as universal healthcare (basically Obamacare), an alternate NAFTA with added labor and environmental protections, the vetoing of DOMA, a successful intervention in the Yugoslav wars, and the toppling of Saddam Hussein by a CIA-backed coup. Of course, a Republican-controlled Congress from 1995 onward prevents some of his more liberal ideas from becoming reality.  The 2000 presidential election is won by Colin Powell against Al Gore, Cuomo's VP. Powell thus becomes the first African-American President of the United States. He leads the nation during 9/11 and presides over a more successful war in Afghanistan, one in which Osama bin Laden is killed in December 2001 during the Battle of Tora Bora. Overall Powell's presidency is generally successful as he pursues moderate policies in domestic and foreign affairs. Powell also becomes the first president to break the ""Curse of Tippecanoe"" when he narrowly avoids an assassination attempt by white supremacists in 2002.  The late 2000s recession still occurs, but is less severe because more financial regulations remain in place due to Bush, Cuomo, and Powell not cutting as much as in OTL. The 2008 presidential election is won by Bill Clinton, who defeats Republican George W. Bush (Powell's VP).  Clinton presides over a more successful economic recovery than OTL and a more stable global stage. He wins reelection in 2012 against Mitt Romney. However he must deal with a rising China and a resurgent Soviet Union (now led by Vladimir Putin).  The current frontrunners for the 2016 presidential election are Vice President Barack Obama for the Democrats and former Utah Governor Jon Hunstsman for the Republicans.  George Bush goes down in history as a generally good president, one who deescalated the Cold War and presided over an economic recovery after the stagflation of the 1970s.  Ronald Reagan goes down in history as a forgettable footnote. He receives the same fate as William Henry Harrison and James Garfield, the other U.S. presidents who died just months after taking office.  There are also conspiracy theories claiming that Bush had Reagan assassinated so he could become President."

HistoryWhatIf,37i9j7,moammargaret,10,Thu May 28 04:06:52 2015 UTC,"I figured the Democratic Party wouldn't swing to the right like they did in our world due to the lack of a Reagan presidency, as well as the narrower presidential elections in '84 and '88. That would make them more receptive to an old-school liberal like Cuomo. In addition Cuomo had a clean personal record, whereas Hart and Kennedy (the nominees in '84 and '88 in this timeline) were sunk by scandals. I doubt the Dems would nominate someone like Clinton in '92.  Cuomo was apprehensive about running for president in our world and likely was in this alternate world, too. His family, friends, and/or party leaders could have talked him into it, though.  As for Dole, while he presided over a successful Gulf War and didn't make a ""Read my lips"" statement, his overall popularity was less than Bush's in OTL since he didn't have Reagan's coattails to ride on. After all, he only narrowly defeated Ted Kennedy in the election. Thus he was considered a bit more beatable in '92, especially once the recession took effect.  Bill Clinton lost the Democratic nomination in 1992 to Cuomo. He remained the governor of Arkansas until 1995 (term limits prevented him from running again). In '96 he ran for an open Senate seat and was elected. He was then reelected in 2002, before running for President in 2008 after sitting out the previous two elections. His past scandals were brought up, though they were somewhat countered by Dubya's own record. Obama sat out '08 because there was no Iraq War and President Powell was generally likable."

Some other scandals could have emerged during Clinton's Senate career in this timeline, or he could have cleaned up his act. By the time he runs for president in 2008, the scandals that sunk him in '92 are either ancient history or cancelled out by his GOP opponent George W.

He signed tax cuts in August 13, 1981.  Many speculated that the assassination attempt was what allowed Reagan to get taxcuts passed through a democrat controlled congress since it caused his popularity to jump which made democrats who lived in Congressional districts that split ticket for Reagan in the Presidential and for a democrat congressmen, to become scared and supported reagan's tax cuts fearing that go against a popular reagan would make them not be re-elected.  HW Bush was not a fan of reagan's economic policies so its likely that he would of reigned on agreeing to the tax cuts. Even with an post-assassination popularity bump(The same that LBJ had after JFK was assassinated).  But back to the point. Still even without the tax cuts the economy would of recovered slower by 1984, enough for HW bush to be re-elected. but with HW bush having a very very diminished victory compared to the 49 state landside that Reagan got in that year."

Fascism never lasts, and normally gives way to multiparty capitalist democracy (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Chile).   All in all, we'd probably end up with a pretty similar world, main differences being:   German and Japanese would be more widespread, as languages.

I think that someone would have messed with it, internally or externally, probably resulting in a dictatorial puppet state. Lets go with Trotskyist communist regime. About that... Stalin performed the purges to eliminate Trotsky and his supporters, many of which happened to have been in the military. Lets assume Stalin's fears were reasonable (I think they were)- no purge means Trotsky takes power. This means a USSR which doesn't believe in socialism in one country, but instead is fundamentally invested in propagating global revolution. I'm not sure it's reasonable to have France and the UK too accepting of the soviets. Their very existence is a reversal of the established order upon which they are based. France in particular was worried enough about the socialist contingent therein. The main obstruction to US getting involved in WWII sooner was that the public was against it, and so was congress. Japan only attacked America after years of being baited to do so by severe US sanctions, and juicy placements of fleets in the pacific. How about FDR outright stages a false flag attack on the US? This also has the added benefit of reduced losses as were suffered at Pearl Harbour? I think a version of WWII where the soviets get too much momentum in Europe would end up continuing (as Winston Churchill wanted), with the allies simply turning against the soviets. Providing the US still develops nukes, then WWII ends with a soviet surrender after losing a few cities to nuclear strikes. Following that, Europe is liberated, and communism worldwide is stamped out (for now). No cold war."

It's hard to think that much changes in the french revolution without him. Lafayette is important in the beginning of the french revolution and in trying to keep the constitution of 1791, but the revolution leaves him behind pretty quickly. Frankly almost any noble of rank could have done most of what he did and someone would have written something similar to the Rights of Man and of the Citizen without him.  His contributions were many and very important but he himself isn't that important.(weird I know) His writings as well as his contribution to the society of 1791 are not something that should be minimized, but he leaves the stage shortly after 1791 and the revolution runs right by he and the other nobles that hadn't emigrated away from France yet.

Long-distance railroads dominated North America because they provided an alternative to shipping all the way around South Africa, no such barrier existed North-South in Africa. In addition, colonies had economies based around trade with Europe itself and a far smaller amount of trade with each other or, in other words, it was more practical to built short railroads from an interior province to a port on the coast than to cross vast distances by rail. Africa was also a relative backwater, railroads already existed and they did little to industrialize the continent, there's little reason to suspect a Cape to Cairo railroad would change that. It'd likely be confined to hauling small amounts of agricultural products and some mail between countries.  The  telegraph line would have been a nice bonus, but again, how much did the colonies really communicate with each other vs with Britain itself.

HistoryWhatIf,37c1yb,monswine,2,Wed May 27 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"These questions are always crazy. Here we go.  Billions of years ago life evolves. Simple chains of molecules capable of reproducing themselves flourish as they are surrounded by their own building blocks which they break apart and reform in order to reproduce. As complexity increases and resources become scarce specialization creates diversity. Many molecules band together in simple symbiotic mutualistic colonies. Eventually simple proto-cells form (the environment within the colony is of a different composition than the exterior). Some single-celled organisms are mobile, others are stationary. Resources become more scarce and competition breeds further specialization. Cells have formed symbiotic colonies of specialized cells, mimicing the previous innovation that gave rise to single-celled organisms. Multicellular life evolves. Single-celled organisms that use solar power to produce enough energy to grow and reproduce have evolved. They produce a dangerous toxic chemical substance as a result of this reaction which they dump into the oceans: oxygen. Because oxygen has a high affinity it is destructive to most complex organic molecules but some other single-celled organisms have harnessed it to help them digest other organisms. Life that is not oxygen-tolerant goes extinct. Multicellular colonies have incorporated oxygen producing and oxygen processing organisms as new potent energy sources. Multicellular life branches off into plants and animals. Plants affix them to shallow rock and root themselves in shallow sand or float near the surface. Animals essentially do the same, though some are mobile and able to move under their own power in search of plants and, more importantly, other animals. Molluscs, Arthropods, and Vertebrates evolve. Simple vertebrates look more like worms than fish. Backbones are essentially slightly reinforced nerves but will eventually grow into an internal cartilagenous and skeletal infrastructure for the attachment of muscles. Arthropods have a wildly varying number of exoskeletal sections and limbs. Their compound eyes, large size, and powerful muscles and armor give them dominance over this era. Molluscs protect their soft bodies by producing calcium carbonate shells but are more mobile than their echinoderm and cnidarian ancestors.  Vertebrates develop armor, molluscs develop internal, rather than external, mantles. Without recourse to crawling out of the water, arthropod evolution has diversified but changed little, their powerful grasping limbs still give them an advantage over soft-bodied squid and slug like creatures and slow-moving armored fish.   That's more or less the first 4 billion years on our planet. Plants will retreat into shallower waters with more access to sunlight. If they can grow high enough and draw carbon dioxide from the air directly and absorb sunglight above the surface then maybe we see weird forests. If natural underwater bays still exist (but with those extra feet of water that keep it from being land above the surface then just maybe we see detritus and roots creating environments for nurseries but robbing the water of its oxygen content (lack of cellulose digesting microorganisms). At the same time the water is relatively clear of silt since rivers can't carry clay and dust into the bays.   Fish never evolve tolerance to fresh water, which means plenty of fish never re-evolve tolerance to salt water. Since this is a pretty significant step in the evolution of marine life we would never see many organisms that benefitted from this including actinopterygii (the dominant group of fish) or they would be very different. A world with sturgeon, salmon, lamprey and eels, etc.   We might see some arthropods crawling the stalks of plants to escape predators, mate, lay eggs. Perhaps in such an environments gliding and flying insects could evolve. Something like giant mayflies where the organisms spends most of its life as a carnivorous sea-scorpion like nymph then attaches itself to a stalk, pupates, and lives for a few days as a flying adult in a frenzy of mating and egg-laying. There might be some very interesting species that become capable of travelling incredible distances from forest to forest as adult fliers. Sadly, this might be a world without beetles.   Assuming oxygen breathing fish still evolve in these oxygen-deprive niche environments, and that muscular limbs are still effective in pushing aside debris and maybe even pushing nostrils above the surface in those very shallow spots then nature might still produce something similiar to early amphibian like fish and maybe even permanently aquatic salamander like amphibians. I don't know if there's food for them outside the water though. There are no beetle larvae in the ground for them to root out and evolve dought-resistant eggs and skin chasing so the end of the line for vertebrates seems to be amphibians as opposed to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Unless there's an environment rich in food sources and shelter above the water's edge for them to colonize in the name of backbones.   I can imagine something akin to flying fish evolving as light weight and speed become increasingly important to fish species. I doubt we'd see anything like the flish of The Future is Wild by c. 2015. Still, the air is begging to be colonized by something other than concentrated populations of seasonal flying ''insects''. gas-filled lighter-than-air organisms seem the best choice but things with gas bags like Portuguese man-o-war would dessicate in the air unless it were incredibly moist. I guess the planet might be warm enough that if they stayed near the surface they could float in the air and dip tentacles into the water to collect food looking like weird gestalt zeppelins.   Plants would still need to rely on water to reproduce so we wouldn't see wind or animal based ways of mixing gametes like pollen. Which makes flowers really unlikely. But innovations in seed structure like aerodynamic or floating models might proliferate.   in OTL pelagic areas are very much empty, devoid of anythng but microscopic life for meters and meters, whereas land is almost always filled with plants and animals. I don't know, if it's one of the primary landscapes available, if open ocean would be any less deserted. I doubt it.   Eventually coral atolls and cays would form, unles corals or something like them never evolves. We'd see some land formations. They'd probably never reach more than a few feet above sea-level. But they'd be there. Once they form, you'll have wonderful tidal landscapes for all sorts of diverse organisms to flourish. It would be interesting to see, the only solid ground would be created entirely by life. Since in OTL these places are ravaged by hurricanes but are still incredibly biodiverse I doubt life in this ATL would be discouraged even by their inevitable massive tropical storms. If seawater freezes in the north or south that's another environments outside of water for life to exist, albeit temporarily. As the continents shift (but never quite break the surface) some formerly tropical coral cays will be pushed north or south and become subtropical. This would provide another new environment for life even if the coral itself would be long dead.   As for mass extinctions, the planet would sometimes get to hot (siberian flats, methane eruptions of the Permian) or too cold. And it would still be hit by asteroids and comets. The extinctions before life on land would still occur including the great oxygen die-off. But the mass extinctions, perhaps due to our woefully incomplete fossil record, never seems to strike the oceans as hard as it does the land.   Now we get to civilization. What sort of kooky, if any, species has learned to modify its environment to suit its needs and passes on such knowledge to its offspring through learning? I have no idea. Certainly some cephalopods are surprisingly intelligent. They have large brains. It's largely due to their big eyes and multiple tentacles as well as the complex ability to change their skin color and texture. Still, many species also exhibit complex intra-species communication using all these tools. Cephalopods certainly seem to be the prime candidate for the birth of a sapient species. I don't know what could bring it about. Most cephalopods are solitary and based on primates and cetaceans living on your own isn't the best path to big brains. Cephalopods lay eggs but what hatches is microscopic and drifts along the ocean currents. Mammals and birds, the OTL most intelligent creatures all take incredible care of their offspring so that they can be taught things, or at the very least the young can learn by observation. Some species of Octopus go for long periods without hunting in order to protect their broods and funnel them with oxygen-rich water until they hatch, usually giving their lives in this way, but they can't teach them anything. Based on the paltry example we do have of intelligence evolving there would have to be a species of highly social, k-selection cephalopod which just seems to go against the grain of cephalopod evolution and I dont know what stressors could turn it around. Still, I've read stories where flippin' Opabinia evolves into an intelligent race of spacefaring aliens so who the heck knows. Maybe r-selection and high intelligence aren't mutually exclusive."
HistoryWhatIf,37c1yb,monswine,1 point,Thu May 28 12:04:18 2015 UTC,"TL;DNR The world is basically the same, most complex organisms high up the food chain are bilaterally symmetrical because that proved to be successful long before life invaded land. The atmosphere and ocean is still filled with oxygen because that too arose before life discovered land. Plants will eventually grow stalks above water in order to absorb unfiltered sunlight and arthropods will follow them. No life will evolve permanently unattached to the Ocean. Civilization may not occur even with cephalopods and shallow water acanthostega types might be the end of the line for tetrapods unless they find a way to compete with fish and can invade the open ocean. Anything that evolved as a result of interacting with fresh water or land could not have. Dry land might still pop up thanks to coral reefs but would probably only be shelter to various species of shellfish."

By making blacks ""sub-human"" it drove a permanent social wedge between poor whites and blacks.  So yeah, the culture clash is severe, as you said.  But also understand that when you overturn that moral applecart that allows slavery in the first place, poor whites will also fight to keep their ""status"" such as it is, above the slaves that they see brutalized and subjugated.  The whole social structure is so complicated and messed up that there exist numerous PhD-level volumes of the stuff.  And as I believe and I hope that most other people in this sub believe crap that happens in the past has a definite effect on the present; we cannot divorce the legacy of slavery in the United States from our current thinking on matters of race, class, and economic opportunity.  Now, that's a bit more social grandstanding and preaching than should probably be in this discussion. Sorry for the digression.    So, I'll close with the fact that some kind of reckoning between the extremely different social and economic structures of the North and the South was inevitable.  Perhaps not armed conflict, but something would have happened eventually."

Perhaps not armed conflict, but something would have happened eventually.   One of the ways this reckoning could happen without full war is that the other Southern States see how spanked South Carolina got in the 1830s and takes a serious look some economic changes. They open up more to Industrialization and trade rather than just being planter economies.   They start urbanizing and mechanizing their plantations (as far as pre 1870s farm mechanization can really go) which starts to reduce the need for slave labor. While Plantations will still be slave labor intensive, the growing urban centers of power will be much less slave reliant. In fact slaves will be persona non grata in factories as the OTL tredegar iron works strike shows (a strike over the importation of slave factory workers). Slaves in an urban setting would be stevedores and house servants and cart drivers. Factory labor would be reserved for low class whites.   This would create a class of southern merchant elites who would compete with the planter elites for power in the coming generation. Dixie and Yankee cultures would not be so alien as they were by 1860. Also by bringing more mechanization into daily lives of those Planters, and bringing plantation life closer to the urban mechanics we may have developments in plantation mechanization such as early mechanical cotton picking rigs  which could reduce the need for slaves in mass numbers.  Unfortunately this doesn't help black people too much since this would only add voices to the call to send black people either back to africa (a place most had never seen) or to central america.   It could replace the Civil War with a second trail of tears as millions of blacks are deported between 1850 and 1900.   That would be very sad..."

Estimates for causalities range as far as from 500,000 to over 2 million for the allied forces. I have read estimates of as high as 5-10 million dead Japanese, all of whom would throw themselves fanatically at the allies. It would make  previous Banzai charges seem like walks in the park compared to what the Japanese were willing to do to defend the home islands. As for the Cold War, Japan would be occupied for many more years for reconstruction. It would still be an ally, but it is possible that the Russians take all of Korea from the Japanese while the allies are distracted and maybe invade the home islands.

Japan was starved of resources and starving in the literal sense, and those estimates were by Allied forces who had to justify the use of horrific WMDs on population centers. Much of that stuff about the average Japanese being fanatics also stems from Allied propaganda - you can't fanatically defend when such basic things as the food ration aren't being given to you and healthcare is severely lacking. You can see how ineffective this so-called radicalization was by looking at how little lasting effect it had - the Occupation was remarkably peaceful and you'd think a population as brainwashed as they supposedly were into thinking death was glorious and Japan could never surrender would fight back a bit more than they did.   The Japanese were suing for peace even before the bombs - just with terms instead of unconditionally (chiefly, they wanted to keep the Emperor and parts of the Empire). But either way, after the fall of the Tojo Government they knew their time was up, and they'd have likely surrendered within months anyway. There was no way that without their colonial possessions they'd have been able to continue fighting for longer than a few months anyway, and the Allies really needed to do no more than keep Japan under siege to force a surrender."

With no nuclear deterrent, WWII might just continue, against the USSR (both sides were keen enough). Alternately, WWIII with the USSR would probably start soon after WWII. Lets assume the latter.  Consider the Korean War, Stalin made damn sure that whilst providing military aid to the north, there was no direct combat between Soviet and American forces. Why? Well because it was the cold war, and he didn't want it to turn into WWIII and go nuclear. Without nuking Japan, USSR wouldn't have seen the horror of the nuke firsthand, and wouldn't have accelerated their own nuclear research project, meaning they wouldn't have gotten their own nuke as early as 1949.   The Korean War still happens in 1950, but the USSR still hasn't developed their own nukes. They're aware the US has a terrible and powerful secret weapon, and have some idea of how powerful it is based on leaked intel of American tests, and are aware the Americans have built up a stockpile of these big bombs, but are unsure how many (301). They don't have a real idea of the devastation they bring, though.   Stalin gets cavalier, and throws his full might behind the DPRK, fighting the UN forces protecting the south directly, pushing them back with ease. The situation between East and West Germany gets tenser as forces mass up on the border. The UN demands Stalin stand down, Stalin refuses.  America nukes Pyongyang, immediately triggering a Soviet counter-attack in western Europe long before the devastation can be assessed. Tanks stream into central Europe as the Soviet war machine overpowers the NATO forces protecting it.  The leaders of the west have a crisis meeting - Pyongyang was supposed to discourage the Russians, but their victories in Central Europe have only spurred them on. The votes are cast, and the verdict is clear: America is to launch a nuclear bombing campaign that eliminates the central logistical column driving the invasion of Europe. Berlin, Warsaw, and Moscow all suffer simultaneous nuclear strikes.   The UN demands the immediate and unconditional surrender of the USSR, but they receive no reply. Many of the USSR higher-ups, died in the bombing of Moscow, or soon after (falsely thinking themselves safe in regular conventional bomb shelters). Stalin did not die in the attacks, but was exposed to lethal amounts of radioactive fallout. As he watches his comrades perish to radiation poisoning, surveys the ruins of Moscow, and realises his inevitable death he issues a statewide broadcast calling for every last man woman and child to fight the capitalists down to the last man, woman, and child. Shortly after sending the command for unrelenting total war through to the military, he takes his life.  The initial strike on Berlin, Warsaw, and Moscow did take the wind out of the Soviet advance, but it took the futher bombing of Tirana and Sofia to secure capitulation from the Warsaw Pact states, and the additional bombing of Kiev and Stalingrad before the remnant USSR command officially capitulated. In total eight cities underwent nuclear bombardment.   Hostilities were far from over, however. For the next two decades, occupying NATO forces were entangled in a vicious guerilla war in Eastern Europe with communist terrorists that enjoyed the sympathy of the local populations. As the full horror of nuclear holocaust reached global awareness, mass protests spread across the west until at long last the UN passed a resolution banning nuclear weapons altogether. Popular opinion has it that many nations keep them in secret nevertheless.   Even after the occupation of Eastern Europe ceased, coalitions of western forces frequently return there to meddle in the affairs of the fractured former USSR. Warlords, 'friendly dictators', and anarchy reigns. Critics claim that the west deliberately perpetuates conflict in the region to further their own geopolitical and economic interests.   After the Times Square terror attacks of 1973, Nixon declares a war against socialism, demanding that nations worldwide are either with him, or against him. Though framed as targeting only radical leftists, all manner of left sympathisers and activists are persecuted. Civil liberties are torn to shreds in the hunt for reds under beds, and any critics are tarred and feathered as 'pink'. A coalition of the willing is formed later that year to eradicate radical leftism from South America, where hazy links to the Times Square bombing were traced. A series of drawn out and bloody regime changes occurs over the course of the next decade, leaving South America in ruins, and the west deeply divided and in debt.   Ignoring international sanctions prohibiting a military, Japan re-militarises and mobilises against China. Without the will or funds to oppose them, the USA instead affirms the Japanese aggression as part of the war of socialism (a song the Japanese themselves sing). The Japanese defeat China after 4 years of fighting, and their peacekeepers spread out across asia to 'help' asian nations combat socialist insurgencies. By the end of the 80s, most of south-east Asia is firmly under Japanese control, or Japanese controlled client states."

It would have been the first war in which the United States and the Soviets actively used atomic weapons not only as threats, but as weapons on the battlefield. The Soviets, recouping from WWII and with minimum ability to reach the continental US with them, would have US atomic weapons dropping on their doorstep. However, the US and allied forces would have limited numbers, as you mentioned, and no ""home court advantage"" (faced attrition), and so they would have had to be extremely tactful in their strategy to shield their limited numbers in the Korean peninsula and lower China - against Soviet atom weapons and the millions on millions of conscripts who would be pushed against them."
HistoryWhatIf,3784fe,Dr_Insomnia,7,Mon May 25 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with you, I'd like to play something out   I think Truman would have to be crazy to use atom bombs. This basically says to the soviets we will use them, they aren't just for MAD. I can see this escalating to a conflict in Europe where Russia had huge amounts of armaments and men as well as the support of most of Eastern Europe. The USSR was actually liked in the east at the time as they had got rid of the nazis. Also some UN forces were in Korea so Europe would have even less men defending it, just encouraging a Russian attack. Might be full scale or might just be to take a certain target like Berlin.    By 1950, the Soviets were far behind the Americans in terms of atomic capabilities. Their first air-to-ground test did not even occur until late-1951. Had the US decided to use atomic weapons, a Soviet atomic counterattack would had to been delivered by ground, or hastily produced for ATG.   MacArthur had planned to use 30-50 to create a radioactive belt to prevent invasions from the north and intimidate the USSR. How easily then, would the western powers declare that a land invasion of Western-controlled Europe would result in Atomic retaliation in Eastern States? In particular, these weapons were not capable of the massive destruction we would see years later with multiple warheads.    I'm pretty sure the rest of the world would become more pro soviet even if the USA just dropped a few bombs on china, never mind their entire invasion force. Europe would probably still drift to the USA out of fear, but I think there would still be protests. It's not just about military power, people didn't want another long war so soon.    With the granting of huge tracks of Europe to the USSR after WWII, and the increasing fear of communist invasion, the politics aligned. It might not have been particularly popular, but US and most Europeans at the time were still accustom to war shortages and casualties. It would be suitable, the war-industry complex could plead, to let the soviets have the war torn lands of Eastern Europe in e change for the massive and much undeveloped continent of China, right underneath the Soviet state - which to the east in particular was an area with little Russian population to begin with, who still maintained their own cultures and customs separate from the Communists.   It would not be clean and would bear a heavy toll, but the United States would be able to divide or assimilate the Chinese state and isolate the Russians to their stretch of Europe and a small portion of the Middle East. With the world in awe that the US had such great technological and military power, the doors would be open (even if by force), for the US and her allies to further colonize and open industry in the yet to be developed reaches of Africa and South America, to capture the riches and oils of the Middle East - and to prevent such a long ""cold war"", albeit open a different path to that competition."
HistoryWhatIf,3784fe,Dr_Insomnia,3,Mon May 25 22:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, and again I agree - but for the sake of asking 'what if';   since the US was very secretive of it's programs (for good measure), and had the ability to control what the press said both on the battlefield, through connections and lobbying, and even accusations of treason - perhaps then, they shielded most of the destruction away from the people in the US. Not many US soldiers had seen the initial casualties and subsequent victims of the two Japanese cities - and there was actually select populations of soldiers, airmen and civilian towns that were either knowingly (or in the majority, unknowingly) exposed to atomic testing in the US Southwest. They would see that the US is using it's new technology to accomplish what took 4 years in Europe and the Pacific. The war drums of what little the press was allowed to say could beat, and bear in mind it would be very racist and all based on speculation.   Alas, we would still lose hundreds of thousands, and Stalin, furious at the US, would disregard millions more of his men as he launched another scorched earth campaign towards the heart of war-torn Europe, using thousands upon millions of WWII of refugees as collateral damage. Soviet production would assume war time status as the world's now-most powerful tanks rolled out daily, and German and Italian POWS liquidated or banded into hasty penal units and sent against their own people. Floods of refugees would begin pouring into the west, reducing what little infrastructure and food already existed there, and bogging down avenues of approach - which the soviets would have no problem 'removing' on their way to the English channel and the north sea. Soviet submarines would mobilize against sea-trade, severally reducing the US ability to evacuate and to resupply.  The strain put on the US economy through overproduction, through allocations of food and material, would completely bring the economy back to 1938/40 levels - the golden age of the 50s that we are familiar with today - would not happen or would be delayed by 10+ years and thus push back or eliminate the 'baby boom'. The prominence of 'negro platoons' would increase, which would fuel domestic civil rights uprisings and train tens of thousands of black men and women in the art of combat - giving a rising star of the Nation of Islam, later known as Malcolm X, the army he needed for dire and possibly violent acts of unrest as the long US-Chinese-Soviet war dragged on into the late-50's. The computers that had come out of WWII would be further refined, but seen as instruments of War - and so civilian development of them would be limited and expensive, possibly reducing or severely delaying the ""computer revolution"" we are familiar with.   Needless to say, by the early 1960's, there would not be a hippy movement like we know, computers would be used almost extensively by the military, a bloody civil rights movement would be underway, the economy would be struggling, the press would have heavy censorship, use of atomic weapons in war would be normal, the baby boomers would be near-nonexistant, the fear of Chinese or Soviet agents would be greater than McCarthy could of dreamed of, and Europe would be completely and utterly destroyed - leaving the US with only it's exploits spread thin in Asia, Africa and S America - while the soviets geared up for the next atomic war on their terms.

Figures like Cortes and Pizarro were incredibly lucky; they showed up when the empires they sought to control were caught in unimaginable political crises that had been caused by the plagues. Imperial opponents allied with them only because they saw the central state was weak. In almost all cases, being able to divide and conquer depended on the pre-existing depopulation from disease - it wasn't just the Spanish who did this. The English were able to seize the Eastern Seaboard the same way; after the plagues, Native nations were substantially weaker, and the English could play tribes off of each other.  Without the plagues, the Europeans were almost at a total disadvantage. They had a minimum 3000 mile supply line. They had no command of the local language or cultures. They knew nothing of the terrain. They didn't even have a historical model for conquering in this fashion.   Guns and horses are nice, but they would not have allowed the subjugation of the Americans on their own. Arrows had a superior rate of fire and could punch through armor, and the speed and mobility of a horse doesn't much matter as much when you don't know where you're going and you're outnumbered scores or more to one, to say nothing of the difficulty of simply getting horses across the Atlantic in good enough condition to be ready for a massive intercontinental war.  Without the diseases doing so much damage, Europe is stuck trading with the Americans.

For example, because regime change in Germany was a central Allied war goal, negotiations seemed impossible.  However , the central obstacle to regime change in Germany was, in fact, US insistence on a policy of unconditional surrender.  Admiral Canaris, head of German military intelligence, made a number of overtures in 1943, including secret meetings in Istanbul, Gibraltar, and Paris, in which he promised to depose Hitler, if Germany could be promised an equitable peace.    At the same time, Petain and the Vichy French continued to approach the Allies for negotiations, overtures which De Gaulle continually sabotaged, in order to consolidate his own future as the sole leader of post-war France.    On the military side:  During this time combined bomber offensive, particularly the daytime raids of the US 8th airforce, we're suffering heavy losses, and had failed to halt the increase in German industrial output.  It wasn't until early 1944 that the Luftwaffe lost superiority over Germany, and the bombing campaign began to cause a decline in military production.  At the Casablanca conference in January of 1943, it was decided to postpone any invasion of France, (much to Soviet frustration), in favour of a lower risk, British advocated Mediterranean strategy.  So, while the German military position was certainly untenable in the long term, by the early summer of 1943, the end of the war was by no means in sight.  Indeed, German defensive successes during the Tunisia campaign only heightened US-UK apprehension of a direct invasion of the continent.  It is only after the failure of Citadel and the end of German operational capacity in the East, the US-UK invade mainland Italy, and it's only after Operation Bagration, and the destruction of Army Group Centre, the go-ahead for Overlord is given.  Finally, what is the strategic advantage to the US-UK to insist on the unconditional surrender of Germany?  Rather, than a formidable German proxy to halt Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe, the result of Franco-British-American occupation is to force the commitment of significant military resources for a period of more than 40 years as a check to potential Soviet aggression.  Thus, it seems that insistence on unconditional surrender buys the British and Americans a worse strategic outcome at the price of 2 more years of war, billions of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of casualties."

The Allies agreed to a negotiated settlement, regime change, etc. The German leadership then turned around and told the Germans that they had really been beaten and should try again. If the Allies had let the Germans get off with another Versailles, they probably would have just launched WW3 20 years later."

Indeed, just 3 years after the end of the war the US-UK reversed policy, deciding against the deindustrialization of Germany or a harsh peace, and instead pursuing a policy of economic and political recovery and reintegration through the end of economic sanctions and provision of Marshall plan aide."
HistoryWhatIf,376xzh,HaydenHank,4,Mon May 25 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"This is no speculation at all and in fact, the question had been put to the Western Allies: As early as 1943, the resistance within the Wehrmacht[1], through e.g. the British contacts of resistance member Wilhelm Canaris, tried to explore terms of peace if the resistance got rid of Hitler[2]. Churchill's reply, transmitted to Canaris, was simple: ""Unconditional surrender"". Likewise, Helmuth James Graf von Moltke tried to contact the British and get assistance for the German resistance, only to be rebuffed in the same fashion. Moltke also contacted Roosevelt through the OSS, reporting on the extend and plans of the German resistance. The result was the same as with the British: ""Unconditional surrender"". There were several more such attempts until July 1944, when the German resistance was crushed.  ""Unconditional Surrender"" as an unquestionable doctrine had actually been established by Roosevelt at the Conference of Casablanca in January 1943. For the German resistance, this doctrine was the most important obstacle in their recruitment efforts: They understood very well that it would mean the destruction of their country, even more loss of territory and people than after Versailles as well as the displacement and death of millions of their countrypeople. As long as it remained the Allies' demand, German soldiers would fight to the end under whichever leadership; however if the Allies signalled they were ready to retract it in the event of a successful coup, a considerable number of German commanders - even within the Waffen-SS[3] - would have joined the resistance, negotiated for peace and the war - at least in the west - would have been over.  The Normandy invasion, Huertgen Forest, the Battle of the Bulge: These might not be remebered by Americans as the bloodsehd they were, the term ""Iron Curtain"" might not have any meaning to Europeans, had the Allies not thus isolated the German resistance.  So why didn't the Allies cooperate with the resistance and indeed later even derided the attempt against Hitler's life of July 20th 1944? There are speculations which I find rather preposterous about Roosevelt's health, undue Soviet influence etc. Others take into account the fact that Roosevelt had been an original Wilson man, supporting Wilson's attempt at writing his name into the history books by creating the League of Nations. In the end, we will probably never know, only that thousands kept on being sent into the maw of the European war.

This is very difficult because ecology and geography are major drivers of history. I will take a quasi-mulligan and say that ecology will change in so far as that southern ecology will mirror northern ecology.   That being said there will be many more southern hemisphere civilizations than in OTL because there will be places for them to bunker down and grow food surpluses.   The increase in ancient civilizations will mean a world wide trade network rather than just a northern hemisphere trade network. I also am literal when I say world wide because the increased land distance between  nordoeurope and sudeurope will encourage sea voyages, along with the proximity of north Thailand and south Thailand will create some very rich island city states.   The American civilizations will not have an Inca type, but a double amount of Mayan types.   This means the age of exploration that Europe endured/enjoyed in the 15th and 16th centuries and that China had in the 13th century would have actually happened in the BCE epoch. The interconectivity of these civilizations will spread plagues much more rapidly but also spread food stuffs. The Potato and Tomato will reach the ""old world"" very early on and Wheat and live stock will reach the ""new world"" very early on.   This will stimulate a very early naval technology boom and have radical impacts on religion spread, empire growth, barbarian migration.   Example, let's say that Rome has contact with the Mayans and the Mayans think the Romans have a nifty idea in creating German buffer tribes through tribute. Imagine the Mayans creating buffer tribes in northern Mexico.   Well, this had a major impact on German culture in OTL, imagine the Fall of some Mayan empire involving invasion by proto lakota. And on the issue of the Proto Lakota, since there is trans-atlantic trade 2000 years before OTL the horse can get to North America (and north america del sol) and the plains indians can get a start up way before they did in OTL.   Suffice to say there wouldn't be any Americans, nor would the region be named ""The Americas"". It would have Latin, Greek, Chinese, and Mayan names.   The fact that the point of divergence is so far back in history, maybe even in pre-history, that the amount of changes are unfathomable."
HistoryWhatIf,377tx2,Historyguy81,4,Mon May 25 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"Humans evolve in central Africa, right along the West African Sea (where the Equator lies). They then spread. Humans enter the Americas from both points, and through the coin flips of history, crops get domesticated in the Northern Fertile Crescent first. This small difference doesn't much matter, because the Indians Oceans (West and East) close of a wonderfully habitable climate for early civilizations to colonize. The Cradle of Civilization is tremendously dense and technology spreads faster.   In the Americas, the narrowing paths of migration from both ends lead to cultural bottlenecks that make idea transmission more difficult. North and South America end up with unrelated cultures, which generally lag behind the Old World.   Speaking of, Old World scholars are starting to notice the perfect symmetry of the continents. This triggers an age of exploration rife with philosophical, political, and religious zeal. Priests see it as a sign from the gods in the divinity of duality, while kings and merchants are quick to understand that natural resources like gold, if found in one hemisphere, are sure to be found in the other.  Thus begins the Gemini Age. Dozens of religions and state philosophies arise that feature a kind of classical Manifest Destiny. E.G., the priest-kings of a Southern city-state call for war on their Northern Counter Parts, who happen to have significant but untapped silver deposits, justifying aggression by identifying them as doppelgangers.   Leaders also sponsor explorations east and west with iron age technology, since any valuable find will be reproduced in the opposite hemisphere. Even more interesting to Old World philosophers is the notion that the world is also doubled in an East-West fashion just as it was doubled to the North and South. Gemini philosophers generally presume the world to be laid out in an orderly fashion, and so they direct exploration of the world in a pattern-seeking manner.  The Indians Oceans become the center of these Gemini cultures and their philosophical warfare, and radiating from out of the packed chaos of those civilizations are the so-called Outlands - Europe, Central Asia, and West Africa. Travel to the western Outlands by sea is impossible, overland is costly, and exploring only reveals the ever-colder wastes of Russia, so these regions remain legendary to the Gemini cultures.   The Outlanders aren't familiar with dualism nor do they have much use for it, being so remote, so they adopt Gemini technology without taking the culture. They're jealous of Gemini wealth, and so continually look for ways to circumvent the land barriers to trade. They attempt building Suez Canals, capturing the Bosporus and Strait of Gibraltar, and building vast Asian roads, but these efforts are frequently met with failure. Only after two centuries of effort does one pay off - the Southern Suez canal opens, leading to immense wealth for the South Mediterranean trade empire of Crete once it connects with the Gemini.  Traders in the East Indian Ocean, jealous of the new opportunities had by the West, begin to wonder whether the apparent pattern of islands going East goes so far that it wraps to West Africa. Such a route would be immeasurably profitable, they think.   This thinking leads first to the capture of the Straits of Malacca, the only ways sail east out of the Indian Ocean. Explorers push east further and further, discovering many small islands and their mirrors with ships that put OTL iron age vessels to shame. After decades, they discover Hawaii, and from there, finally make contact with the Americas."

Madagascar is about 450 km from the mainland, and has been settled since BC and an active part of Indian Ocean trade for most of the time since then.  All that said, it is going to be a very long time before there are half-decent maps of the entire planet.

HistoryWhatIf,3750yg,joelwilliamson,3,Mon May 25 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"Heavier gravity means a heavier craft.   Say you have a boat that (on earth) weighs 1 ton. On jupiter's gravity (and by that i mean it's current gas giant gravity - as a rocky body it would be worse) it would weigh 2.34 tons. Since boats float due to displacement, the boat would sit much lower in the water and might even sink. Also the higher weight would put more pressure onto the hull, and might cause issues dealing with turbulence. Without incredibly strong materials, a ship might just shatter when hit by a hard wave.   This may not be a big deal if you already knew how to build boats (you'd just design for it), but if you know nothing of boats, it might prevent you from ever really designing large boats. They might consider the largest feasible boat (until their version of the 1800's and iron clads) as something like the size of a trimerime.   Higher air density may or may not offset the lesser lift generated due to greater craft weight, but it would cause higher drag and friction, and greater wear on engines. Interesting trivia: modern fighter jets have different top speeds at different altitudes due to this very fact.   A much higher atmospheric pressure would cause many other problems - probably easiest to assume earth standard atmospheric pressure and just fudge the altitude until it matches. But doing that makes flight harder (everything would be 2.5 times as heavy, after all).   edit to add: probably ""survivable"" if you arrived there, but i don't know that it'd ever develop human-level complex life on it's own"

HistoryWhatIf,3750yg,dethb0y,4,Mon May 25 00:24:43 2015 UTC,"Let's for the moment say that boats float by displacing their weight (which is related to their mass, but takes gravity into account) in water. It is  technically correct to say this, though if you use weight in the equations it makes more work for yourself later when you perform the calculations. The end result is the same. If gravity increases the weight of the boat would increase.  However, wouldn't the same also be true for the water? It stands to reason that the boat would displace the same amount of water there as it would here on Earth. This is one of those physics problems where gravity washes out of the equations and is irrelevant. if you remove gravity from the equation The only thing that matters is the mass of the two objects (the boat and the water) The water would also still have the same density under the higher gravity as it does not appreciably compress, so it also stands to reason that the boat would also still behave similarly in the water on that planet as it does on Earth. Sails might be more efficient however as the air around the boat would have a higher density... Have to think about that one. There should also be more aerodynamic drag because of the higher density of the atmosphere. Oh! The speed of sound would also be different so a sonic boom would occur at different speeds! Though, that wouldn't normally apply to boats anyways; I doubt that you could reach the sound barrier in one. This is fun to think about!"

It would be more reasonable to have this planet have thousands of normal continents, then maybe some travel can happen. (Who would be capable of walking/sailing/flying across an expanse that's dozens of Earth diameters long?)  Many civilizations will grow completely untouched from one another, in this world, even Europe, the small and crowded continent would be so massive, that you would be hardpressed to know even your closest neighbor.  Wars for land may be unheard of, everyone is too far away, and there's land to burn, even when assuming most is useless desert.  I would bet even if some of the civilizations achieved our current tech level, they will not have a world map, nor knowledge of all the other human civilizations.

All that mass in a lump the size of Jupiter wouldn't form a planet, it would form a star (albeit probably a rather dark and desultory star). Even if it didn't, the 11 Gs surface gravity wouldn't be amenable to anything like Earth life.  Once you've handwaved physics, though, things can get interesting.  Climate would be weird. The distance from the California coast to the mountains is ~200km. On Jupitearth it would be ~2000km. South Dakota would be over 10,000km from the nearest coast, nearly a quarter of Earth's circumference. Would there be a rain shadow for the mountains to cast, or would the air have given up all of it's available moisture before even reaching the mountains? Without mountains to act as rain-catches, how prevalent would rivers, streams, and lakes be? What would the mountains look like without water driven erosion to shape them? It seems like for Earth-like conditions to persist, the land would need to be broken up into much smaller chunks relative to planet size to maintain roughly Earth-like continental proportions. That's to say nothing of the seas, which would be much more vast and potentially much deeper. Such oceans might birth waves that could drown whole continents as if they were tiny atols in the Indian ocean.  Space would be much, much more difficult, though this ventures dangerously close to paying attention to physics again, which would bite us in the ass. For Earth, a stable orbit is impossible below 160km altitude, or ~6500km from the center of the planet. For Jupitearth, the same altitude equates to ~64,000km, nearly twice the altitude required for geocentric orbits on Earth. Not to mention the fact that if you miscalculate your reentry your capsule could wind up 400,000km away rather than 40,000. With such a massive obstacle in the way, it would be a wonder if the Jupiterrans ever got into space, so no Moon missions, no satellites, no easy global mapping or telecommunications, no GPS.  You could handwave all that too of course, but in that case you just get ""Earth x 10"", and I'm not sure how interesting that would be. With the same challenges in transportation and communication, nation states still wind up being roughly the same size so you just get more of them. The same challenges mean that nations farther away have less interaction than on Earth, meaning trade and politics with them are less significant."
HistoryWhatIf,3750yg,Sarlax,12,Fri Jun 19 23:58:02 2015 UTC,"The surface area of such a modified Earth is about 122 times greater, and linear distances are about 11 times greater. The latter number is the most important. If this enlargement occurred shortly after our species appeared (roughly 200,000 years ago), we'd probably be stuck on Eurasia and Africa.  Reaching other continents would be practically impossible. Some exceptional neolithic voyages occurred in OTL, particularly from Asia to Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar, but this was done with canoes and island-hopping, often on islands that have been submerged since the last ice age. If we multiplied such distances by 11, we'd probably have never spread out into the Pacific. Likewise, although North America was once connected to Asia with a land/ice bridge, the inhospitable climate would probably be insurmountable to primitive people over distances of ~1000 miles. So no humans in the New World.  The origins of civilization will be different. I'm supposing it happens much earlier. With 122 times the surface area, Earth provides many more opportunities for humans to domesticate crops and animals. Instead of wheat getting domesticated around 9,000 B.C., it might happen around 100,000 B.C. Same with various animals.  Civilization spreads across the Old World, but the distances involved are so vast that the cultures evolve in their own directions so completely that they forget about each other's very existence. Languages and religion mutate to the point of appearing entirely unrelated.  Building big empires is harder because the distances make administration almost impossible beyond a certain point, and the spread between natural borders makes defense difficult. Instead of a place like Ancient Egypt being able to administer a relatively compact state, the would-be pharaohs are instead surrounded by endless opponents to their rule. Civilization continues in all directions, millions of city-states surrounded by nothing by their own kind.  Even after the spread of civilization across the Old World, I don't think humans would ever discover the New World except by accident.

The large populations will make for large economies of scale in the industrial age and more rapid technical advance.  Even with the same surface gravity (if this world has some kind of fluffy center only as dense as Saturn somehow) getting into orbit will be harder because the longer circumference of the orbit. If the days are the same length though the centripetal force will make the world more oblate with less felt gravity at the equator. But even though this world has a larger radius than the altitude of geosynchronous orbit it should not be more than 3% reduction in felt gravity as the inverse square law means Earths gravity is usually about 36 times weaker at that altitude.  The greater distances between the equator and the poles means the equator will be hotter and the poles will be colder.

Their equipment was in many ways superior (particularly in tanks, the Germans were using the Czech Skoda LT35 tanks to invade Poland at the time, while the French had the better armed Somua S35).  However, the French thinking in leadership was quite outdated, and the French manpower pool was comparatively low.  A decisive push in 1939 probably could have broken through on the German border, but this would mean that the Maginot line would have to be abandoned, and many German divisions would probably be ordered to abandon Poland as soon as their objectives were reached in order to stop the French.  Beyond this, the British were not geared up for land warfare in 1939, and arguably neither were the French.  As such, the French advance would likely be slow and methodical, looking like something from 1918 rather than 1939.  It's unlikely the over-cautious French would capture any major objectives.  German tactics were unquestionably better at the time, and levels of preparation were higher, even if the troop strength in the west was comparatively low.  Additionally, Germany would have the advantage of fighting on friendly ground.  My overall thought is that this would quickly turn into a protracted defensive campaign for France, with their army falling back to the Maginot line as soon as the Germans fresh from Poland arrive.  British troops might trickle in slowly, but not enough to make a difference.  No blitzkrieg, and possibly no Dutch invasion, but Germany eventually wins by going through either Belgium or Switzerland around the French static defenses.  The Germans do spill more of their own blood in this scenario, but Paris still falls in early 1940 and France collapses all the same.  The Royal Navy on high alert would probably mean no invasion of Norway, but Denmark is probably occupied anyway.  The Dutch are probably cowed into helping Germany if not actually invaded directly.  If the Swiss are occupied, it will necessarily be mild, though with a considerable number of military aged men serving in German colors sooner or later.  All of these things have consequences for the eventual invasion of Russia, but the manpower drain of a protracted French campaign hurts Germany the most."
HistoryWhatIf,376rgu,southernbeaumont,3,Mon May 25 12:19:32 2015 UTC,Why do you think the French would concentrate on the Maginot Line? They didn't even do that in reality; they knew a German thrust would likely come through Belgium and that's what every single war plan planned for.
HistoryWhatIf,376rgu,elos_,1 point,Mon May 25 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"It's relatively simple, if the French are going to make a determined attack on Germany, it's going to be at a thinly defended spot on the border rather than through Belgium.  When Germany pushes back, the French are going to defend the most defensible spot, which is the Maginot line.  From here, the Germans can either batter their heads against the Maginot line or attack through Belgium or Switzerland.  The French would have to thin the Maginot line anyway to counter this, but I don't believe the French leadership would be inclined to give up on their static defenses quickly.  Quicker in this timeline than historical 1940, but I can't see this campaign being a quick one of maneuver given that the Germans would not have the advantage of surprise due to having an enemy that had already tried and failed to attack them first."
HistoryWhatIf,376rgu,southernbeaumont,1 point,Mon May 25 18:07:22 2015 UTC,But your premise that they would not want to abandon the line is already a false one. The entire purpose of the line is so that a very small reserve force could hold it so the main force could fight elsewhere. Why would they suddenly be hopelessly attached to it?
HistoryWhatIf,376rgu,elos_,2,Mon May 25 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"I can't see the Germans undertaking an invasion of Switzerland, the only thing worse than attacking a fortified position is one situated in a mountainous region. The Swiss would be able to hold out long enough for French Alpine troops to assist, followed by regular troops to help man the fortifications. German Panzers would also be bottlenecked and unable to fight a war of manoeuvre and would be susceptible to Swiss anti tank weaponry as their 20mm anti-tank rifles were potent enough to defeat all early Panzer types.   An early 1940 defeat for France would be a serious stretch as 1939/40 featured a very cold winter that would bog down the German advance long enough for the French and British to better prepare their positions to blunt a spring offensive, especially if the Germans are halted in Belgium should they decide to attack through there in 1939."
HistoryWhatIf,376rgu,Tammo-Korsai,1 point,Mon May 25 22:53:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that a Swiss attack is unlikely, though from a terrain standpoint, the western corridor into France is not nearly as difficult as the rest of the country.  It also lacks the difficult river crossings that come with invading Belgium.  The mountains are another matter, best discussed elsewhere, but the Swiss corridor option was dismissed in the Schlieffen plan as well as by the Nazi leadership."

The thing was the French were weary of attacking fortified positions after learning from WWI. How effective the Siegfried Line would have been under an all out attack its hard to say.
HistoryWhatIf,376rgu,Von_Baron,3,Mon May 25 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"In this timeline, the French mobilize pre-emptively and decide to persist with their original plan for the Saar Offensive with a full forty division force with a great deal of armour and air support.   The Western Front  The Siegfried Line is reached swiftly due to token resistance but stops there temporarily as heavy guns are brought up to breach the defences and secure a breach through the line. They are surprised to find it was not as strong as initially thought and scatter the second rate divisions that are lacking tanks and air support.   The Germans react by recalling multiple divisions from Poland, at least more than the six they did in reality to counter the pressure of the serious offensive action, buying Poland a little more time but it will be impossible to save them before Warsaw falls due to the surprise Soviet invasion. Poland falls some weeks or even a month later than it did thanks to the French attack and many more Polish units retreat southwards to Romania so they can evacuate and continue the fight in France.   Buoyed by their initial success, the Allies continue to pour more divisions through the breached Siegfried Line and advance into the Ruhr to seize key German war industry. The RAF and French Airforce also invest the majority of their strength in this offensive and initially enjoy total superiority until the Luftwaffe pulls out of Poland, though it is low on bombs (50% of their pre-war stockpile was consumed already) and losing the industry needed to replenish itself, ground forces are equally hurting for equipment after the invasion of Poland.   By mid 1940, the German forces are struggling to muster the materiel they need to counter attack and are slowly being forced back. Support for the Nazi party begins to decrease rapidly whilst communists and democratic parties gain underground support.    Hitler refuses to sue for peace against the advice of his Generals, who react by forcibly removing him from power both to end the war while they can still negotiate and prevent any chance of a communist movement capitalizing on the unrest. The rest of the Nazi party leadership and Waffen-SS are arrested and imprisoned, some die in vain counter-coup attempts whilst others yield without a single shot.   Germany is immediately obliged to release its annexed territories, demilitarize the Rhineland and restore its part of Poland. War reparations are not as harsh due to the swift victory and relatively low loss of life for the Allies, who might need German resources to deal with the issue of Soviet occupied eastern Poland.   The Winter War and Eastern Poland  Confident he has a free hand after the lack of Allied response to the Soviet declaration of war on Poland in 1939 but cautious about their proactive nature on the Western Front, Stalin turns his hand to the invasion of Finland, considering it to be fair game.   The invasion flounders as it does in reality and the emboldened Allies plan an intervention to save Finland and contain Soviet expansionism. The Soviets decide to negotiate a settlement with the Finns and seize Karelia so they can fortify the inner Polish and the East Prussian borders as the Allies deploy to deter further Soviet incursions.   Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigns due to his ill health and Winston Churchill is selected to succeed him due to his previously unpopular strong stance against communism and Nazism. He is determined to find a way to free eastern Poland before it is made into a puppet state but no immediate action can be taken as the Allies build up in western Poland.   The three Baltic States become a flashpoint as they decide to resist in the hope of spurring an Allied intervention. At the East Prussian border, Lithuanian troops fleeing to the Allies attract a Soviet artillery barrage that strays into British positions. Mistaking it for a precursor to a Soviet invasion, they return fire and the situation spirals out of control as the RAF are called in to find and bomb the artillery positions.   Stalin is soon informed of the incident but is persuaded to calm it down as the rest of the Soviet forces are in no position to attack along the rest of the border, coupled with their miserable performance in Finland and the Purges. Churchill is also persuaded by the French not to escalate the attack as they too are not ready for a full scale war against the USSR.  Both sides continue to prepare for war, but it is not clear who will attack first. Though if the Allies succeed, they could push Stalin to yield Poland and possibly the Baltic States as he would not be dealing with extreme ideologies looking to outright conquer the USSR."

HistoryWhatIf,3769a2,Ronit_Hazarika,2,Mon May 25 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"Okay so Hannibal returns to North Africa. Rather than playing to Scipio's tactics he displays the usual brilliance of the Italian campaign, albeit he augments his strategy to reflect his inferiority in cavalry numbers. Using tactics similiar to Seleucus he uses his elephants to effectively neutralise the cavalry advantage that Scipio had. Eventually the Roman forces are routed in a devastating battle.   Hannibal returns with the several thousand Roman captives including Scipio to the city of Carthage. Celebrating a triumphant victory over the Romans and dispelling his fear of Hanno the great and Carthaginian anti-war faction. This leads to the pro-war party to reemerge as the dominant force in Carthaginian politics. Carthage and Rome are thoroughly exhausted by years of war. With the loss of Spain and parts of North Africa, the Carthaginians are not eager to press for war. The Romans much as in the OTL continue to espouse their policy of never surrendering to foreign enemies. The Carthaginians pro war and anti war parties agree on an armistice with Rome, and this causes a delay of hostilities.   Hannibal takes this time to train the army of African levies and his core of veterans. Rome rejects the armistice following Hannibal's increased aggression in North Africa, the capture of punic cities and the restoration of the kingdom of the Massaesylians (revenge for the betrayal of Masinissa). However, the major economic ramifications of continuing the war are harsh meaning neither power can field an army that it would like. The Carthaginians prepare for an invasion of North Africa again, this time with a united front presented by Hannibal and Hasdrubal Gisco.   The Romans send more legions to complete the conquest of North Africa (depopulating the Spainish garrisons) but Hannibal's lightning campaign against Masinissa has removed a powerful ally from the Roman invasion force. The battle does not end well for the Romans, who are fighting a now experienced and enlarged army. They are crushed by brilliant tactics against a reinvigorated Carthage.  The Romans withdraw from Spain, sending troops to southern Italy and Sicily to prepare for an invasion by Hannibal. By this point Rome is suffering greatly from depopulation and economically ravaged by war, likewise Carthage: suffers similiar symptoms with the additional losses of prestige. Hannibal advocates a quelling or conquest of North Africa, and favors a peace treaty with Rome. Even suspending usual procedures and having pro war speakers removed from the senate.  Hanno the Great is chosen as the envoy and the peace negotiations end with a more favourable than OTL peace treaty with the Romans demanding 10,000 talents but unlike OTL they cannot support their claim for control of Spain and restrict Carthage with demobilisation as they have lost Massinissa in North Africa and had withdrawn their forces to Italy effectively ending both Carthaginian control and Roman Control of Spain.  The aftermath of the second punic war means that Roman influence in North Africa is reduced - in fact it doesn't occur unless a third punic war occurs. Racial and political animosity with the Carthaginians and the conquered Punic cities of North Africa mean that war will definitely flare up again. The Scipiones never become a hallowed name of roman heroism and are never exposed to political character assassination. The next generation of Romans grow to hate Carthage, and listens to the survivors of the ""hannibalic"" war. The war causes a Significant change in the ideological make up of the Romans, who rather than experience total victory feel the consequences of pyrrhic victory, and the uncertainty of another power of equal or greater resolve. This leads to a more defensive ideology and focus on security. The Romans fear the uncertainty of their northern border and lead wars of conquest against their Gallic neighbours. Likewise, war against a resurgent Macedon is likely forcing the Romans to think of their eastern front. The Romans for a time become inwardly focused on defense and on the increasing internal problems of the Republic. This means the Romans are reluctant to Initiate hostilities unlike the prelude of the third punic war.  Carthage grows in prosperity as the major trading hub of the Western Mediterranean. Hannibal does not immediately enter private life, nor does he face the consequences of his political rhetoric. He remains a fiercesome general and conquers much of North Africa, Mauretania and the other Punic cities forming a new powerful Carthaginian state, but not as prosperous as it had been at the height of its power. His final conquests are in southern and eastern Iberia reestablishing a Carthaginian enclave on the peninsula. This reconquest would only fan the flames of hostility between the two great Mediterranean powers.   The end result is a more stable duopoly of Carthage and Rome which exist together for a time before ideological, economic and racial tensions cause a third war. Which much like the second punic war would be devastating and could see either power emerge as the dominant force of the Mediterranean."
HistoryWhatIf,3769a2,lbyrne91,0,Thu May 28 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"The Romans were not losing the Second Punic War. Full stop.   But I don't want to just shut your question down. So let's say it's a total rout, and Scipio Africanus dies in battle.   The Scipiones never obtain their incredible prominence at Rome.  A couple generations down the road, our Scipio Aemilianus either doesn't get adopted by a Cornelius Scipio or, if he does, doesn't have the prestige he did in OTL. He does not receive the commands he once did, and so he doesn't get deployed out. Carthage still gets wrecked in the Third Punic War without him (it just takes a little longer).   However, let's say whoever snatches up Scipio's commands doesn't particularly like Jugurtha, or, more likely, never runs into him. With no one to put Jugurtha in line for the throne, the Jugurthine War never happens. As a result, (this is a stretch, but I'm trying to make things happen differently), Marius never rises to particular prominence. The Republic totters along, with no dictatorship of Sulla to hasten its demise.   Eventually, however, the same structural problems are going to doom the Republic. And when they do, it's not particularly likely to be Julius Caesar and his (adopted) descendants who end up on top. No Octavian probably means no orderly transition into the Principate.   Rome never reaches the peak it had in OTL. Or maybe it ends up better organized. The ripples are really hard to predict this far out, making any statements about what's different is essentially just make believe by this point."

Guns shifted the military component away from specially trained warriors to easily trained mass conscripts.   Imagine how long it takes to be good at using a sword. Several years of devotion to the techniques of the sword.   How long does it take to be good at using a gun, several months of bitching and moaning about how bootcamp sucks.   How does a King pay his army of nobility? He divvies up the land he conquered and gives it out to the nobility as feifdoms.   How does a King pay his army of drafted peasants? If they survive toss them some silver. If they die, toss their widows less silver.   So, when a King's army was mostly made up of his vassals who spent most of their time learning how to use swords, those vassals had power.   When the King's army switched to peasants who spent most of their time doing peasant things, like farming, and later trade, crafts, etc, then they gained the power.   in the 1640s in England and the 1790s in France the Peasants decided they didn't need the king anymore.   Now, these are both really condensed versions of the time line, but I hope it helps clear up, a little, the connection.   Edit: more connections.  As the kings began to ask for money instead of service for taxes, the lords have to turn to peasant merchants to gain the money to pay taxes. When taxation was in service, the Lords had more power because they had the land, when that switches to money, peasants can get rich by trade or production, instead of farming.   Because kings wanted money for peasant armies they created the demand for peasant labor which made more peasants wealthy which helped push the demand for peasant representation in the parliaments which expanded into democracy."

It's not so much that guns allowed for democracy as it is that guns decreased the importance of the nobility in a feudal culture. Gunpowder did not, so far as I am aware, greatly alter the culture of the Muslim Near East, for example, which was generally less feudal and more imperial in nature.  The revolution in military affairs throughout the Renaissance was caused less by gunpowder technology and more by the increase in discipline in the standing armies and the greater wealth caused by trade which allowed the creation of larger standing armies in the first place. True mass conscription didn't take place until the Napoleonic era, long after the introduction of firearms and the bayonet as the standard battlefield weapon.

It was still heavily committed to the Napoleonic war. It could not afford to loose any more ships or men  to North America.

They might impose punitive dues which could have bankrupted the nation and caused a split between the Federalists and Republicans and within the Republicans between the War Hawks and the non war faction.   If the UK imposed sanctions, different states would be hurt differently. southern cotton and tobacco states would probably be getting some benefit by having a constant market in the UK, but the mercantile states and industrial states would be heavily impacted by the costs.   It might not be pretty.   It all depends on how the Americans lost. If it was an outright loss, then the UK could dictate terms, if it was a negotiated loss then they would have to haggle and the US had home-field advantage."

In the peace negotiations their initial demands were to create a Native American buffer state to the south of the Great Lakes. The Americans proposed that Canada would be annexed to the US. Both demands of course were unreasonable considering the indecisiveness of the war so both sides agreed to status quo ante bellum.  The whole war was logistically very difficult for the British and they didn't have enough incentive to allocate more resources to the American theatre.

The US tried initially to claim they weren't supplying weapons to the rebels (they used third parties to get them into the country, and they were Soviet/Chinese weapons). Pakistan and China never had to cover their tracks. The only difference would have been the introduction of the stinger missile (before the Mujahideen had only had Soviet SA-7's and British Blowpipe's which were in effective at hitting fixed wing aircraft). Now some claim they Stinger one the rebels the war, but most historians claim that though it did make air attacks on the Mujahideen more costly it didn't stop them. The Mujahideen changed tactics and increased numbers is generally thought of what changed the tide. The Stinger was only sold from 1986-1988 in Afghanistan.   However no US involvement in the Soviet-Afghan would have made the difference for their own invasion.

The numbers  of confirmed kills supplied by the Mujahideen do not seem to match up to official numbers of downed aircraft. As can be seen here the Soviets had heavy losses before the introduction of the stinger. The rebels had quite a large amount of anti-aircraft guns. And the aircraft were operating in hot and high conditions that they were not designed to operate in. The Soviets didn't really think the Stingers made that much difference.

If so, then human populations remain overall tiny and concentrated in a few very productive river basins and coastal areas--places like Japan, the Pacific Northwest, and others where you can maintain a stratified culture on seafood and game.  Monumental works of architecture are difficult--you need a lot of labor for that.  Stone tools are the rule--I'd really be shocked if metalworking becomes common, as the specialized labor needed to mine and smelt ores might be too much for such societies to take.  In the Americas, native copper was worked around the Great Lakes, but not copper ore.    If not, then the cradle of civilization will probably be Eastern Europe (home of the horsemen) and Anatolia (home of cow herders).

Basically there's only so much you can gain by putting man-hours into hunting and gathering. The yield to effort ratio plateaus pretty quickly. Which is why hunter-gatheres tend to have much more leisure time than farmers (assuming human cooking capabilities and not hours and hours of chewing and digesting like non-human primates). The yield of agriculture however, is pretty much dependent on how many man hours you can throw at it. Which is what encourages having many children to work the farm with you. Luckily having lots of kids in quick succession is something humans are surprisingly good at.   Hunting and gathering emphasizes a high degree of knowledge about surrounding ecology: migration patterns, animal and plant food sources, life cycles. To the point that attempting to seize a neighbouring territory would be useless without detailed understanding. Agriculture requires good knowledge on weather patterns and seasonal changes and emphasizes large tracts of arable land (as long as you have a sufficient population to work it)  the population of a hunter-gatherer society can never really ''explode'' like a people who discover agriculture but it should grow steadily and allow plenty of modern conventions like stone masonry, metalworking, and such.   Civilization is a little tricky. Once you've gotten enough people that specialization is possible (not everyone is focused on collecting and processing food) then it's literally only a matter of time. Trade networks are the next step and that should easily be handled by demand for materials like ore unless, somehow, every ''territorry' contains precisely what every group needs in abundance.    In the story a portal is created between our world (well, circa 2002) and a parallel universe where humans went extinct and the only people are sapient neanderthals. Their technology differs from ours for a lot of reasons (lack of fossil fuel burning technology due to the smell) but the fact that they still hunt and gather to collect food means they don't care for milk or bread and their population only numbers in the tens of millions. In one of the books there is a discussion between the neanderthal main character, a native american anthropolgist, and a canadian geologist? dicuss the relative virtues of hunter-gatherers vs pastoralists."

After all, Ireland and Scotland were not considered important enough to spill Roman blood in capturing or holding either.  Assuming the place were cleaned out, it probably would be re-inhabited, but by other Britons rather than Italian or Greek refugees and criminals.  When the financial and strategic situation of the western empire forced the Romans to pull back and defend Italy, I don't think Manx would warrant much special consideration given its general remoteness and smallish size.  So, assuming it was cleared out by Rome and reoccupied by other Britons, I suspect the new people of Manx would live a similar lifestyle to historically (as a function of geography), but with a different language and set of traditions (by virtue of being a different set of people)."
HistoryWhatIf,36vym4,fakeuserisreal,25,Fri May 22 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"Instead of being driven to extinction in the third century B.C., some enterprising merchant in the Mediterranean successfully transplants live plants to the soil on the north shores, allowing cultivation. Silphium survives and continues to be in high demand and generally available only to wealthier people.  Under Augustus, silphium is planted throughout Sicily along with its grains, planning to turn it into a major cash crop for the Empire. This dramatically drives down the price of the plant, causing its use to spread rapidly through the lower classes as it enters a wide variety of beverages and foods.   As an abortifacient it is unmatched. Simple teas taken by sexually active women prevent pregnancy (as far as they know; it may be causing early term miscarriages, but as they occur before quickening, the people of the Roman Empire are none the wiser). With a substantial reduction in the incidence of unplanned pregnancy, the status of women in the Empire begins to shift.  The change is slow and subtle, but women begin to have improved civic rights. Not bearing children, it becomes easier for them to take on responsibilities in place of men, and after a few prominent cases in which noble women who would have been pregnant otherwise are able to fill the shoes of their husbands, a trend of granting greater powers begins. Women come to be allowed to hold political offices and vote. This growing power is shepherded through the Vestal Virgins, which takes on an increasingly important political role.  Christianity never takes off; Jesus is either never born because of silphium, or the empowerment of women in the empire makes it harder for Judaic messiah cults to spread so easily.  At the same time, the delay of childbirth produces a gradual decrease in the Roman citizen population. It's not catastrophic by any means, but it does result in a demand for more males. It's especially noticeable in the military, where there are significantly fewer males coming from the upper ranks.   Inevitably, the need for officers is filled from the ranks of the auxiliaries, the non-citizen military forces of the Roman Empire. The OTL auxilia were already more than half of the Roman military, and in this ATL their ranks are larger and they achieve greater status. This results in the Empire's Roman-centric approach evolving to grant greater status to provincials.  By 300 AD, the Roman Empire is substantially different. The Vestal College, all female, is effectively the legislative body for domestic matters in Rome and the Vestalis Maxima is as powerful as the pope would be in OTL Europe. Women and men have identical political rights; only the military continues to (mostly) exclude females.   The Roman concept of citizenship also changes, with auxilaries finding easier paths to imperial citizenship. High ranking officers are entering the Senate and acquiring estates in Italy. Rights extend more broadly to provincial subjects, male and female.  Roman nationalism is a strong force; the broadening of civic power has instilled greater loyalty to the state among men and women, Roman and provincial alike. The Empire is going strong in 500 AD and controls most of Europe."
HistoryWhatIf,36vym4,Sarlax,21,Fri May 22 17:34:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that the status of women in Roman society would be significantly changed if they had less children. Many emperors and senators had no children with their wives and they still didn't advance in society.  Moreover an effective contraceptive would be massively destructive to a pre-industrial society, or to be more exact to one without vaccines and modern health care. Take for example the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. His wife bore him thirteen children and only five of them survived to adulthood with the future emperor Commodus being the eleventh child and only son. Now consider that the imperial family had the best resources and you can imagine how many children died in slave or plebeian families. Given the sheer death rate of children it was never really possible for most families to plan how many children they'll have.  Patricians usually had too few children because they wanted to have only one or two and they weren't terribly concerned with the children being biological, which led to the widespread practice of adoption (because those who had too many couldn't afford the patrician lifestyle for all their children, so they had them adopted into other families with no children).  On the other hand a farmer's family would not only aim to have as many children as possible to help with the farm work, they'd also want to have as many as possible to ensure at least some survived, because they didn't have anyone to adopt children from and presumably most didn't want to if they could have their own.  Because of this I find it very questionable that the state would support a contraceptive. Limiting population growth wasn't a thing in the Roman Empire and small families were a luxury for the wealthy. Slaves, farmers and common citizens had to breed as much as possible to ensure a steady supply of labor and manpower for the army.  I'd say that if the plant became widespread it'd probably be banned by the Romans and their religion might shift to enforce stricter moral rulers regarding sanctity of marriage and a requirement to have many children. They'd also increase the frequency of their already frequent campaigns of conquest in order to replenish slave populations and they'd have to allow more immigrants into the empire leading once again to the scenario which happened during the late empire when the empire became too bloated to survive without a nation forming process (like the one in China) and therefore it fell apart."

If children die frequently at any point before they reach a reproductive age then family planning become unfeasible. Because if you plan to have two children and have only two, there are no guarantees you will in the end have two children to take care of you when you grow old.  This also relates to a further issue regarding children in the ancient world, and that is that children were the ones who were supposed to take care of their parents when they grew old. If you didn't have any then there was no one to take care of you once you became old. There wasn't a system in place like today which gave tax money from other people's children to those who didn't have their own. (Which TBH is something that should have stayed unchanged. If someone chooses not to have children that's their choice, but I shouldn't pay taxes to support welfare programs to take care of them when they're old and useless.)"

According to famous statistics half of Roman kids never make it past 10 (this probably isn't helped by the fact that Romans regularly rounded tombstones to the nearest V). Childbirth is also one of the leading causes of death for women prior to germ theory and proper medical care. Surely if you can limit the number of unwanted births you don't really decrease a woman's reproductive potential because every accidental pregnancy is a huge health risk to parent and child.   I just don't quite agree with the scenario where a couple has a few children, and some of them die; therefore everything falls apart. I mean we're talking about Roman citizens, not Kings of England. Unless being able to selectively abort or prevent pregnancies by drinking tea causes massive depopulation I don't perceive the issue because overpopulation is just as dangerous. The Empire gets overrun anyway."
HistoryWhatIf,36vym4,monswine,3,Sun May 24 11:53:29 2015 UTC,"The Roman government spent a lot of money on doles for political reasons, and only within the city of Rome. The bread and games political strategy proved very efficient in maintaining public peace and support for the government, however it also led to riots in case of delays of the dole or poor harvests in Tunisia and Egypt.   Surely if you can limit the number of unwanted births you don't really decrease a woman's reproductive potential because every accidental pregnancy is a huge health risk to parent and child.   It is a risk, but since the only available strategy at the time was to have as many children as possible in hope that a few would survive then simply by reducing the number of childbirths you reduce the number of children who survive.  Because consider the time required for a woman to give birth to thirteen children as in the case I referenced. If she starts out at 16 or 18 then she can do it by 29-31. If she postpones the first pregnancy to 25 (which is still early compared to modern day) then she'd be done by 38. And even today pregnancies past 32 (or 35) are considered risky. A Roman woman bearing a 12th child at 37 would have little chance of survival compared even to the standards at the time. It's simply a matter of biology. Childbirth is very demanding and younger women are more likely to survive it and give birth to healthy children, which is imperative if she needs to have many children. Consider how in most societies up till very recently (non-noble) women were expected to be married before they turned 20 and considered spinsters after that. That was a product of people knowing that after that age she is no longer likely to produce enough children for there to be any survivors.   where a couple has a few children, and some of them die; therefore everything falls apart.   It's not about some of them dying, it's about up to as much as 300 out of every 1000 babies dying. Compare that to our modern standard of only 20 (5 or less for western Europe, Canada and Australia) out of a 1000 babies dying. And even today you need 2,1 children to reach reproductive age simply to maintain the population. This means that in roman times a woman would have to have at least 4 children on average to ensure that enough survive to maintain the population level with modern death rates. Obviously, since the death rate was much higher back then due to war, disease, slavery, etc. then she'd have to have more children, and we arrive to the numbers of 8-12 children women historically bore in that time period.  Which returns us to the issue of the sheer time necessary to give birth to so many children and why delaying pregnancies would be undesirable demographically.  Furthermore having children later decreases population growth on its own even if the same number of births is maintained simply because the cycle is longer. A woman who has two children at thirty will have four grandchildren at sixty, while a woman who has two children at twenty will have eight grandchildren at sixty. If we were talking about four children then the difference would be 16 to 64 children which is a difference of half a roman century division of children and very noticeable.   Unless being able to selectively abort or prevent pregnancies by drinking tea causes massive depopulation   See above why it would.   I don't perceive the issue because overpopulation is just as dangerous   The entire Roman was between 50 and 70 million people which is less than the modern day population of Italy alone, and this population was spread over a region which is home to close to a billion people today. Rome was never in danger of overpopulation and in fact had the exact opposite problem due to disease, war and barbarian raids. This led to them granting barbarian tribes land within the empire and subsequently to the destabilization and fall of the empire."

And I accept the statistics that a lot of people suddenly not having children (like war, famine, plague, or someone dumping birth control into the well) would have statistically exponential effects on population as you move forward through time. I mean those hypothetical descendants really pile up.   I disagree that it would be as devastating to Roman civilization as you've outlined but I guess I'm seeing it more as a tool for giving women a little more agency, especially mistresses and prostitutes, as opposed to something for wives, which would literally defeat the entire purpose of Roman marriage: producing legitimate children."

The ""problem"" with contraception is that it usually encourages women to marry later and have less children (perhaps understandably because I'm given to understand that giving birth is awfully painful). And once you have a perfect contraceptive there's little reason not to use it. Wives might even use it without their husbands knowledge to avoid having to give birth for the Xth time.

Overpopulation being considered one of the primary ''necessities'' that is the mother of invention after hunger and shelter.   There are a lot of Roman staples that went extinct which is what makes it so difficult (along with the total lack of ingredient measures) to reconstruct Roman cuisine. Any way there's only a snippet from Pliny that suggests Silphium contained a significant amount of estrogen and Romans are just as likely to have resorted to any number of remedies and ointments and curses and totems for the prevention or abortion of pregancies. Still, it's as good a candidate as any for plausible ancient birth control.   If women can have a say, a say unbeknownst to their male partners on the number of children they bear the effect on society is enormous. Since it's a lot more attractive than tying linens or goat and sheep organs around a phallus it would find immediate use (assuming it becomes cheap and readily available and of proven unparalleled efficacy) among prostitutes and misstresses. The sudden decrease in the number of bastards (and sudden upswing in infections) would have untold consequences on the history of Europe.   Still, we're descended from pastoralists so there are bound to be plenty of contemporary religious prosriptions against it anyway. If it does result in some sort of freer less sexually strict society in the long-term (like St. Augustine doesn't write his Confessions the same way or doesn't exist, or Christianity doesn't become dominant or whatever) then the world might be pretty different after the fall of Rome. It's hard to imagine the city-states after the fall of the Empire successfully cultivating it. I doubt it would really survive the Muslim conquests if it's as temperamental as historians suggest. If it does, though, there would probably be a stabilizing effect involving the spread of venereal diseases and libertine tendencies. Especially the epidemics like when syphilis reached Europe in the 15th century."

There would still have been the occasional lynching, but much of the southern jim crow laws would still come into effect, but be a bit more mild and would have eroded about two generations sooner. In fact, world war 1 would probably be a much bigger civil rights turning point than it had been without this vengeance factor.   Black men in uniform would have earned much more respect in this hypothetical time line because without the revenge factor more whites would start to think ""wow, i guess black people might not be so inferior afterall""  By the time of world war 2 (which may not actually be inevitable in this time line because without the death of Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson may not actually be in office and a US president could be in office that would radically change the outcome of world war 1. Nothing says the US would always fight on the side of France and the UK either!) race relations may have come to a 1990s era equivalent.   that's just race relations. Industrially Lincoln was something of a socialist and he may have pushed for some early workers' rights programs that could have shifted the whole nature of the US Union and Labor movement radically altering our economic path.

Because of the Khan of Khan's death the armies that were marching west turn back east to find out who the successor is going to be.  The Russian states that existed are never put under heavy eastern influence and so are only viewed as strange by the rest of Europe because of their odd form of Christianity and not for the dramatic cultural differences that eventually took hold (such as Eastern clothing styles). Feudalism never really develops either.  For the remainder of the Medieval Era, the Russian states remain relatively the same but as the Age of Exploration begins, a new ideology begins to take hold. As Western nations expand overseas, there are those in Russian states that wish to expand east to the Ural Mountains and south into Central Asia. There are others calling for a single, united Russian state. It doesn't take long for these two ideologies to become interwoven and soon some of the Russian states begin to adopt this.  By the 16th century all of the Russian states have conquered one another until there are only two left, the Principality of Novgorod in the north and the Principality of Kiev in the south. After a massive war, the largest in Russian history up until that point, Kiev defeats Novgorod and the Grand Prince of Kiev declares himself the Kaizar of Rus.  The Kaizars did not have absolute power like the Tsars in our timeline but that doesn't mean they were in any way pushovers. Throughout the 1600s and 1700s they would expand east all of the way to the Ural Mountains, which would permanently mark the eastern border of their country. Their southern border would move back and forth often, fighting over the Caucuses with the Turks and Central Asia with the Persians. While Rus is viewed as a great power, it can never achieve superpower status.  Rus's very different position in Europe drastically changes the politics of the region. Austria doesn't fear their eastern facing neighbor nearly as much and is too busy focusing on France to bother with making Rus turn west. With only France and the Ottoman Empire to fear, Austria maintains a strong hold on the Holy Roman Empire and no competing power ever rises within it (no Prussia). The Holy Roman Empire eventually either is destroyed and Austria comes to dominate the other German states or the Holy Roman Empire is united into a single state other Austria, either one has the same result with Austria uniting Germany in the early 1800s.  Poland only ever rises to prominence over the Baltics but maintains that power and influence, due to not being divided up between Austria, Prussia, and Russia.  Britain still mostly ignores European politics in favor of expanding overseas and France remains the strongest mainland power until Austria unites Germany. France also has a close alliance with Rus, just like it did with Russia historically.  How the rest of the 1800s and 1900s play out is very hard to speculate. Rus would likely become democratic without too much difficulty. Perhaps the French Revolution still happens and, if it does, Rus would support it about as much as the US did in our timeline (as in right up until around the Reign of Terror started).  A massive war between Austrian Germany and France is basically inevitable, with Rus certainly joining France's side. Britain may or may not join Austrian Germany, if they don't then its an easy Franco-Rus victory but if they do then its really up in the air.  The Soviet Union and the Cold War certainly would not have happened, so I wonder how the modern world would've turned out overall.  Additional points:   Siberia would be a mix of a bunch of tiny nation states and tribes, living in too harsh of conditions for anybody to really consider imposing their will on them. These end up becoming some of the poorest nations of the modern world. The US never gets Alaska, with it falling into British and then Canadian hands without Russia to oppose them there."

HistoryWhatIf,36s94m,Klaw117,-1,Fri May 22 10:31:51 2015 UTC,"Some people attribute Russia's tendency for authoritarianism to be a result of the need for stronger leaders after the conflicts among squabbling princes left the Kievan Rus' vulnerable to the Mongols. If the Mongols had been fended off though, then Russia might be more tolerant of less powerful leaders. This could lead to reformist leaders like Alexander II actually being able to get his reforms through and possibly a fairer democratic system in the contemporary era. If the Bolsheviks still managed to take power in this timeline, Khrushchev might have been able to hold on to power longer because iirc, he was forced out after he was seen as weak in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  However, it's also entirely possible that Russia wouldn't exist as it does today. Today, power is mostly centralized in the federal government, and some have argued that this practice stems from the annexations of the Grand Duchy of Moscow during the medieval era. Before the Tsardom of Russia was established, there were multiple East Slavic states like the Novgorod Republic and the Grand Duchy of Tver, both of which were conquered by Muscovy. The Kievan Rus' was even more decentralized though since it was made up of several principalities. Had the Kievan Rus' survived, it might have taken longer for a centralized East Slavic state to develop. However, the individual states might have been more liberal without the centralization of power by the Golden Horde and Muscovy later on."

The most likely scenario is that she's sent off to a country like the UK for schooling or for her own protection.  Historically, I doubt much would be different. If she were sent off overseas at the Russian people were aware of this, knowing that a Romanov princess was alive would likely improve the morale of some of the tsarists fighting in the Russian Civil War, but it's hard to imagine this being enough to seriously sway the outcome of the civil war.  Beyond that, she'd be just another exiled royal. Under Stalin, she would likely be declared dead in a mass propaganda campaign, in order to demoralize any remaining tsarists. Killing her would cause tension with the constitutional monarchies in Europe, so he couldn't just have her assassinated like he had Trotsky. Decades later, Khruschev would reveal that she was still alive, to the shock of the Russian people, as a part of de-Stalinization.

Because America doesn't have nukes, there's no missiles based in Turkey for the Soviet Union to be pissy about, which means Khrushchev doesn't play tit for tat by staging missiles in Cuba.  As to the scale of the Russian inventory, I'd say it wouldn't be huge - Stalin never showed much interest in developing it once Russia had the bomb. It was apparently enough for him to have nukes. In OTL, Russia didn't begin scaling up nuclear weapons production significantly until long after Stalin died, and without things like SAC being able to strike anywhere in the world with nukes inside 12 hours or the Cuban Missile Crisis, perhaps the Politburo doesn't see the need to go larger than a modest arsenal that allows for Russia to threaten nuclear weapons use without being too threatening."

Wells published The World Set Free, predicting nuclear weapons and (possibly) inspiring Leo Szilard, in 1914).  So... we'll assume that the scientists at the Manhattan Project incorrectly measured the cross-section of carbon, and decided to use heavy water as a moderator instead (the Germans made that mistake, which led to the Allies efforts to disrupt heavy water production at the Vemork Dam in Norway.  This will slow research, since heavy water was expensive and difficult to manufacture, but it likely won't stop it.  The bomb won't be completed by the end of the war-- they barely managed to produce the first three by the time the war ended, and all three were used-- which means that the Soviets probably wouldn't make the big push towards research that they did after seeing what happened to Japan in our timeline.  In this scenario, the United States will begin building and testing weapons as fast as is possible.  The USSR had nuclear weapons ~4 years after the bombing of Japan; NATO will have them in a similar timeframe (nuclear weapons, at least crude ones, are dead easy to construct.  I could make one in two days in my basement, with parts from a hardware store.  The time-consuming and difficult part is refining the uranium or plutonium).  The Cold War plays out similarly to how it did in our timeline, just delayed by fifteen years (and I'm assuming we didn't get into a giant war with the USSR in the meantime).    As for your second hypothetical, where the public finds out about the bomb and there's an outcry: no paper or radio station would have broadcast news about that, because it was wartime and it would have been treason.  And the public wouldn't have complained much, because any weapon to shorten the war would have been met with great enthusiasm.  The chance of the weapons igniting the atmosphere was the result of Edward Teller overestimating the chances of a fusion reaction.  The likelihood of that happening was calculated to be almost zero well before the bombs were ever constructed (why build something that will kill both you and everyone else?)."

The only hope for a Guerre Froide is that the USSR has no long-range missile capabilities thus allowing NATO countries time to develop counter-weapons in relative safety or that despite nuclear superiority the NATO powers are still able to place USSR facilities (including Moscow) under significant risk thus allowing for retaliation significant enough to disencourage nuclear attacks."

Local supporters of bin Laden are both angry and demoralized over the loss of a popular figurehead, even if the Taliban is still in power.  Worldwide support for the mission, even among nations not part of the coalition is greater.   It's conceivable that back-channel negotiations with Arab powers may prevent the invasion of Iraq in 2003 with bin Laden out of the picture.  It's worth remembering that Libya renounced terrorism after 9/11 in OTL and wanted no part of bin Laden's organization in their country.  Likewise, Saddam Hussein would have likely accepted a back-channel deal to mind his own business and allow inspectors to look for the nonexistent WMDs to avoid invasion.  Afghanistan is still occupied, but it's less likely that Iran or Pakistan are involved in the conflict, given that bin Laden is dead and Saddam still presents a counterweight to Iran.  The 'flypaper' theory may still prove true, however.  Arab foreigners seeking to prove their worth for Islam may still arrive in great numbers to trouble the coalition occupiers, and meet predictable ends for the most part.

So, switching out the party who says ""industrialize"" for the party that says ""develop interventionist foreign policy"" might not have has that much of an effect, when in fact BOTH were a priority for the USSR at that time."

These protests lead to clashes with the police, and Jamal al-Hajji calling for the people of Libya to follow the examples set in Egypt and Tunisia (OTL's ""Arab Spring"").   Muammar Gaddafi warns protesters that they will be held accountable for any disturbance in Libya. The protests intensify with the arrest of several political activists. As the protesters seize parts of the country, the use of force is authorized by Gaddafi. Gaddafi's mental state is questionable he blames Al Qaeda and hallucinogens for the crisis.   The conflict escalates in much the same way. However, the stockpile of nuclear weapons prevents direct foreign intervention. Rather NATO begins supplying weapons, food and medical supplies to the rebels. The civil war continues, but is essentially a more brutal conflict. The U.N. places increasing sanctions on Libya. The death toll is more dramatic than in the OTL.  Muammar Gaddafi continues to hold power in Tripoli with pro-Gaddafi supporters The civil war has gone on longer (possibly till 2012-13) without the assistance of NATO air-strikes. However, Gaddafi cannot stop the inevitable. He threatens tactical nuclear strikes on Benghazi and other rebel strongholds but these become empty threats with the U.S. threatening to fire on Tripoli in retaliation. The war drags on to a siege of Tripoli, as rebel forces consolidate control over much of the country. Gaddafi's mental health deteriorating by the day, it becomes increasingly more likely that he will use nuclear weapons to wipe out his political enemies - He believes that he is martyr and in much the same way as the film Downfall portrayed Hitler, Muammar has become increasingly deluded and despondent of the war. Saif Al-Islam stages a coup against his father to prevent nuclear warfare on Libyan soil - Muammar flees Tripoli with an increasingly small loyalist force. Saif uses the nuclear weapon's disarmament and surrender as bargaining chips to secure his family and several other pro-Gaddafi loyalists from certain execution. NATO consents to the agreement and Saif Al-Islam is escorted to Saudi Arabia. Muammar is eventually captured and killed by rebels near the border of Libya (similar to the OTL).   Without the threat of nuclear weapons, NATO begins air strikes on pro-gaddafi strongholds that remained in the country. The NTC capture several abandoned missile silos and hands them over to NATO.  Political instability continues in Libya as in the OTL, but with a heightened NATO presence as they continue to search for Gaddafi's stockpile of weapons."

Would the development of fire and movement tactics, tank warfare, mixed unit combat, the creeping barrage, air to ground attack operations, advanced logistics/supply, and all the rest of the necessary innovations of WWI still have occurred? You could imagine that the German defense in depth on the Western Front gets defeated in a massively slow and bloody offensive that is only successful because of the weight of American reinforcements. The war would then have remained almost an entirely infantry affair, setting the stage for possible repeats of the Western Front (probably on smaller scales) in wars that occur in the coming decades.

Admittedly the resources available were plenty, but nations bordering them had similar access - the Spanish Empire had just as much access to gold/silver and the British had lumber and furs in Canada/Rupert's Land.  I think you're right to highlight that such a hypothetical nation would more probably be concerned with the Spanish Empire/Mexico than British America, the expansion of such a nation would most likely occur southward rather than eastward.   As for the British being unable to prevent the expansion of the Western states, until the 19th century the British Empire was largely centered around the Americas - particularly the Caribbean.

HistoryWhatIf,36j9j2,aeronautically,1 point,Wed May 20 01:02:01 2015 UTC,"I'll vary off a point here and go with the most realistic alternate timeline with a Point of Divergence in the late 1200's in the Southern Song Dynasty of China.  1250-1300: The Song Dynasty, having lost the northern provinces of China to their rival Jins, have retreated to the South to their capital at Hangzhou, one of the largest and richest cities in the world.  From there, they construct an massive naval force that far outperforms any of their neighbors - if anything, it outperforms any seen in the world.  With 100,000 marines on over 1,000 warships of varying sizes, this navy expands Song influence into the Pacific, forcing the various independent nations of Vietnam and the Muslim sultanates in Indonesia to pay tribute to the Song Emperor.  The navy also patrols the rivers of China, keeping the hostile Jin Dynasty, now at the former Song capital of Beijing, at bay.  A new opportunity arrives for the Song to go on the offensive, however, as the Jin Dynasty is dealt a severe blow after the loss of its northern provinces to the Mongol horde, now led by Genghis Khan.  Although appalled by the idea of civilized Han people being ruled by the ""barbarians"", as the Song call them, the Song Emperor sends an embassy to Genghis Khan offering an marriage alliance.  Genghis, knowing he has no chance against the far superior Song navy and only wanting the northern regions of China, accepts the deal and sends 10,000 Mongolian horsemen to the Emperor as a sign of goodwill.  In return, the Song Emperor sends a large caravan packed with gifts of gold and silk, along with several concubines for Genghis and his commanders.    Despite the gifts and forces sent to help each other, Genghis is soon preoccupied with campaigns against the Kharwezids of Persia and other distant enemies, so plans for an cooperative Mongol-Song attack on the Jin are postponed.  As in OTL, gunpowder weapons are invented in the Song Empire; by 1240, the Song army is equipped with various gunpowder bombs and primitive cannons.  Raids are launched into Jin territory, briefly retaking the city of Xi'an and weakening the already faltering Jin state, which is now suffering from a widespread revolt.  In 1260, Kublai Khan, now the ruler of the eastern territories of the Mongol Empire, decides to launch a joint-invasion of the Jin state with the Song, and makes an agreement with the Song Emperor in which he promises to hand back the cities of Beijing (Acting as the northern border), Chang'an, and the Yellow River Basin in return for the remaining lands, a sizable yearly tribute, and the rights to base the newly constructed Mongol navy in Song port (Point of divergence, as the OTL Song seized these cities without checking with their Mongol allies, which enraged Kublai who used it as a casus belli to invade the Song).  The plan is successful; in 1267, the last Jin stronghold in Shenyang surrenders, and is spared from execution by the Song commander of the siege.  Beijing and the Yellow River, the birthplace of China, are reintegrated but the capital is kept as Hangzhou due to its strategical importance.  The end of the 1200's see the first cracks appear in the Mongol Empire, and the Song Emperor seriously consider plans to turn on his former ally and retake the remaining Chinese lands.    1300-1400: This era is one of unprecedented economic development and also social unrest in the Song Dynasty.  Gunpowder is developed into cannons, who's widespread use is used by the Song Imperial Army in campaigns into Tibet and Korea, and also at home, when around 90,000 Jin pretender rebels revolt in Lazhou and seize control of several ports before being put down by an Song force of 300,000.  It is also during this time that the industrial boom in the Song continues - steel is produced at rates that would not be matched in OTL until the 1900's Britain, the Song army swells to 1,500,000 soldiers in arms while Hangzhou has a population of 4,000,000, and the Song navy begins to undertake exploration, first sailing a large fleet of 30 warships to the Philippines and then Guam.  Exploration is also undertaken into Africa and India, with Zheng He, the son of a Song bureaucrat leading the vessels.    Gtg to bed"

If the Tlaxcalans don't have the Aztecs to worry about, they don't bother ally with the Spanish and instead wiped them out, especially considering that Xicotencatl II  would likely have been in charge (well, probably not 50 years later or he'd be a very old man at that point) and he was against an alliance with the Spanish.  The lack of the unifying non-Spanish common enemy is one of the reasons the Spanish couldn't get a significant foothold in the American Southeast. The various Mississippian polities (generally) rallied around driving the Narvaez, de Soto, Pardo, etc., out of the area, rather than using the Spanish as a weapon against some major power in the region."

I actually think this WI would have some major changes, since the natives' problem wasn't a lack of organization.  It was plagues, out-of-context problems, and massively inferior weaponry.  What the Native Americans needed more than anything was time after initial contact.  There's no getting around the megadeaths and societal upheaval from disease, but time would let them recover and replenish their numbers.  There's no getting around the Europeans being something totally new and alien, but time would let the natives realize that they are not gods or whatever, but just another faction to be dealt with.  There's no getting around the utility of horses, steel armor & weapons, and firearms, but time would let them learn about the strengths and weaknesses of them.  Having the trade and exploration-focused Portuguese making the discoveries instead of the gold and conquest-obsessed Spanish gives them that time.  Sure, once word got back to Europe that there was some gold to be had, they'd probably pick up some interest again.  But the apparent success of Columbus' mission served to crank that up to 11.  He said he'd go out and get riches, and comes back with gold, slaves, and lots of (largely embellished) stories about how much more was to be had.  In this TL, all they're seeing is the primitive tribes of the rain forests, so it's much longer before the wealth of the (now defunct) Aztecs and Incas are revealed.

Plus it wasn't just one outbreak of disease at the moment of contact, but many over a period of 2 centuries that kept hitting them again and again.

However, they saw that the Catholics wanted to pledge allegiance to the pope and foreign powers rather then the shogunate, which is a major reason why Catholics were banned from practicing their faith. (protestants were allowed, as they were willing to compromise on this point. This is why the protestant UK and the dutch were allowed to trade, while the catholic Spanish and Portuguese were not)  What probably would have happened is something close to what happened to the Philippines. The society would use the catholic religion as an excuse to expand Iberian imperialism.  The Iberians would sieze territories (most likely Kyushu, the southern most main island) and graudally expand from there, in a similar manner as the Aztecs and Incas- sieze those in power, and use that power to force your ideals across.

If Christianiaty were to be let be in this new TL we'd probably see much of a repeat in the attitudes of the Iberians with them focused on trade rather than conquest of the Japanese who would slowly convert to a form of Catholicism with a Japanese flavour, foreign (but not too foreign as the Kirishitan of OTL were) from the mainstream Catholicism practiced in Europe but still undoubtedly Catholic."

Well, yes and no, as far as I'm aware...    As far as Yugoslavia goes, Indeed..... it was established by means of an uprising in Trieste and originally called the Kingdom of Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes (sp?). Yugoslavia was definitely a thing by the time hostilities ended.  As far as the dissolution of austria-hungary goes, that was established by the treaty of Trianon (hungarians today are still mad that 1/3 of ethnic hungarians ended up in countries other than Hungary). What were the allied territorial gains into what later became Czechoslovakia? Other than in the Carpathians, I'm not really too sharp on this detail. As for the Ottoman empire, they had lost control of the Hedjaz mostly. But what about the Levant? What about Iraq? That was divided up by Sykes-Picot, but the only allied victory in that region that Im aware of was the British capture of Jerusalem. There's no real reason (as far as I'm aware) that a more amendable treaty wouldn't just grant the independence of the Hedjaz (and ONLY the Hedjaz), the british a small zone from Jerusalem to the coast (much like what actually happened), and the french nothing whatsoever.  That still leaves turkey with the oil fields in Mosul, Kuwait, and some of the ones in present-day Saudi Arabia, and it still leaves them with Syria and Lebanon. The Germans had actually not lost much territory by the cessation of hostilities, it was more a question of not being able to maintain the rate of attrition at the front. But they still had Alsace-Lorraine didn't they? Also, they managed to capture some territory on the russian front.  I'm actually more interested in pondering what would have been in terms of trade, economic development, and so on, if the terms of the peace had been more amenable, similar to what europe saw at the end of WWII, or after  the napoleonic wars (terms which german economic historians credit for having played a role in the industrialization of germany later in the 19th century).

The Mensheviks had plurality, if not the majority at the meeting but left after an argument with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, giving them control instead.   The Imperial system was collapsing. Nicholas II and the nobility were never going to freely give up their wealth and prestige. Just as a reference if the Romanov dynasty was still in power and had the money they did, they would have 300 billion dollars in wealth - 5 times more than the next richest, the British Royal Family. Nicholas was a relatively young man at the time so he still had a few decades of rule left assuming he would live an average lifespan. He was a fairly stupid Tsar, very indecisive and flip-flopped a lot. He was a firm autocrat and certainly was not going to give up his powers. He was also rather delusional and truly believed that his people loved him. After the creation of the Duma it became clear that the Duma was essentially useless and could be easily disbanded by Nicholas. I do not believe that the Tsarist system could have survived in really any way whatsoever. The only one who could possibly do anything was a man named Pyotr Stoltpin who tried to reform the system but was assassinated under mysterious circumstances. It is widely believed that it was the nobility that had him killed, he was at an opera I believe and the gunman killed him there. However, the gunman received the his ticket from a member of the Cheka (secret police).   I haven't read everything you wrote because you wrote so much but what it seems to me is that you believe that if a socialist government would not have intervened in the July Crisis and therefore WWI would not have occurred. If the government you envisioned took control than they would have become involved in the war for the same reason the Germans did - if they did not than it would have been seen as truce-breaking and would have been a massive hit to the prestige of Russia. No one would trust Russia after that. WWI was inevitable. In a lot of ways the world needed a world war to release all the tension, both political, and cultural that had been created in the past decades.  I think that everything that follows the 1910s is very speculative and far-fetched. Imperial Russia was going to collapse, it had been a long time coming.

HistoryWhatIf,36en2y,hanlonm,4,Mon May 18 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on Russia getting into WWI.  Even if Russia managed to become a Constitutional Monarchy, they still have alliance obligations to other European power and a connection to the Slavic peoples of Serbia.  I think that the war would likely start as planned.  Though possibly a politically more unstable government like a new democracy rather than an absolute monarch would have a harder time mobilising for war.  This would give Germany more time to execute the Schlieffen plan to take France.  I don't think this would have had much of an effect though, because of the advantage that defence held (especially) in these early months of the war.    What's interesting is the end of the war. Russia's non longer under the Tsar, but that doesn't mean that the war time shortage and societal stresses won't still be relevant.  It's possible that Russia could still eventually fall to the Germans in some way and things would play out as they did in the OTL with German reinforcements arriving on the Western Front and beginning the Kaiserschlacht offensive in 1918.  But if the Russians managed to hold together then the Germans probably wouldn't have been able to launch the Kaiserschlacht, meaning they would have maintained a stronger defensive position against the eventual British, French, American, et all offensive on the Western Front.  Also, if Russia was a democracy then it's more likely that the US would have joined the war sooner, as it would have been democracies fighting monarchies and Sultanates."

It wouldn't matter if Russia was a democratic state or not, the US didn't want in at all.   It wouldn't matter if the Russians tried to keep it together, they wouldn't be able to form a stable enough government in time to stop a revolution like 1917. The war may have gone on for another year at most if the Germans could capitalize on a slow Russian mobilization but Germany nor Russia had the ability to continue or win a war like that. The outcome of the war would be almost unchanged from real history. Russia was just too late. Germany might have been able to become a stable, constitutional monarchy because of its industrialization, political and infrastructural stability, and its relatively homogenous cultural makeup. But Russia was just in such a bad way at this time it's amazing that the empire survived 1905 at all.   I can't speak as much about German politics of this time, I only studied Imperial Russia at uni.

But I'll sum it down like this.  Mexico joins with Germany and Axis in secret, the Mexican army is rife with logistical and manpower issues. The Mexican army would need to wait for shipments from Germany to equip themselves in which the US may become suspicious of the shipments moving into Mexico. Suspicion that if aroused too highly would have put the US on guard and station troops on the border as a security measure which would have foiled a surprise invasion by the Mexican army. If the Mexican government had managed to placate the US and bring enough arms to supply their armies would still be lax in training. An invasion would start with some ground taken in border states like Texas, but after the initial incursion would slow down incredibly and the USA response would be fierce with a reaction similar to that of Pearl Harbor but without a sea to keep safe from invasion.  TL;DR Mexican invasion in all likelyhood to fail and bring USA into war even quicker."

Without the very specific, very open immigration policy the population never reaches 150 million, at least in one political entity. No central government means no Louisiana Purchase, so no rapid expansion through the MS river valley. The Rockies and West Coast remain in Spanish hands for the foreseeable future    Some of the states could have expanded west, most scarily at the time would have been New York and Virginia, and left the others behind. A tiny New Jersey Bordering gigantic (in land) Pennsylvania and gigantic in both land and people New York would have had a hell of a time not being swallowed up by one or the other.  Quickly Mass, NY, and Virginia would have become the big rivals on the continent. NY, VA and PA would have fought over the Ohio river valley. In this case PA gets reduced to a buffer state between VA and NY. NY and MA would have used Quebec as a wedge against each other. VA could have used it's position, as the most populous and wealthiest colony, to act unilaterally or to pit the smaller colonies against each other.  The fighting scares away many of the would be immigrants to the new world. Meaning that the very rapid settlement of  OH, IN, KY, etc is slowed considerably. The population of the Eastern North American continent grows much more slowly in this situation and more of the folks moving west are colonists from the specific states rather than immigrants striking out on their own.  My guess is by 1835 we have 5 countries:  VA which is everything south of New Jersey/PA and stretches straight west through KY southern Ohio and southern IN. Richest and most populous country. They don't have hegemony by any means but they are the most secure and wealthiest.  PA which is most likely reduced in size to Philadelphia and the surrounding area.    NY everything that used to be NY, PA and forts strewn just north of the Virginians' string of forts defending their river valley. Modern VT would still be part of NY and they would be fighting on two or even three fronts. Indians in the west, MA and Quebec to the North and VA to the south.  MA would be all of new england. Rhode Island may hold out but they'd be in the middle of any war between NY and MA.  Some internal entity.

It's highly likely that Texas would still win its independence from Mexico, but with no America to go to war with them, Texas could very well end up with Mexican land north of the Rio Grande.  Also there was the war of 1812. This gave the united states all south of the 49th parallel. If the states formed a temporary alliance, they could still win, but nobody would look to claim that land.

Napoleon's artillery, some of the finest in Europe and deployed in mass batteries, isn't as effective upon the Allied infantry. Cavalry movements are limited, and especially arduous before the ridge of Mont St. Jean.   The attacks of D'Erlon upon the center, and the slaughterhouse at Hougoumont, are turned into difficult and precarious quagmires. Furthermore, the French army, tired from marching and fighting at Quatre Bras and Ligny, must now cross a killing zone of fortified artillery and famously deadly skirmisher fire from the Allied army. While the Allied army is equally if not more tired, they do not have to cross the ground, they do not have to charge, and they don't have to win. They just have to fight them off. Two exhausted armies thumping at each other. Wellington's defensive advantage is even more telling.   But Napoleon, with no Prussian Army to worry about, has his trump card ready and waiting. He sends the Imperial Guard (Old, Middle and Young Guard) against the British center. However, as the 13,000 man detachment was sent just after 7:00am in the morning, Wellington has more troops aswell. Poor troops yes, but combined with the Foot Guards, the Highlanders, Dutch fusiliers and English musketeers, the Old Guard charges. The Old Guard charges. The Old Guard shoots. The Old Guard gets shot. The Old Guard dies.  And like that, with a thunderous crash, the last breaths of the Napoleonic Empire come down, like the last stainglass in the window of a once-great cathedral.   Napoleon loses. Napoleon withdraws, and is pinned down in a similar way to the 1814 campaign.  Generally, attacking with exhausted troops over wet ground is a really dumb move."

I'm not positive but I'd guess mountain ranges in Australia or even older than the Rockies, Sierras, Cordilleras, Andes. Even where New Zealand is messing it up in the South the mountains are quite old.   Desertification in Australia is due to deforestation as opposed to just climate. Humans have been intentionally setting brush fires on the mainland for approx 70,000 years. Turning forests into grasslands and allowing deserts to encroach. The dominant vegetation in Australia is basically all fire resistant, even fire dependant, which facilitates wild fires.   Still, if you're one of those people fascinated by how deadly and terrifying Australian wildlife is you'll be glad to know we don't live in the world with car-sized turtles, 20 feet snakes, 15 foot lizards, furry hippo-sized wombats, and man-sized birds with axe-like beaks.   If you had an unlimited budget you could do a lot of things to populate the center. It's a question of environmental sustainability. The USA has a large population, and quite a substantial acreage is polluted beyond it's ability to sustain people but it's nowhere near maximized. If the Americans suddenly decided to stop caring about preservation of natural resources they could bulldoze the forests and  explode their farmlands and population. But that's stupid.   So if you want to build massive wells to pump water from underground into the desert you probably could. Hell, you could use solar power to irrigate the desert and grow crops in greenhouses (sandstorms and flies aren't exactly hospitable to fruits and veggies) But that requires an insane budget and a level of dominion over the landscape that governments just don't have.

Either way, though, the cold war was pretty much queued up circa mid WWII. Both sides knew they'd be rivals after taking out the axis. Churchill even wanted to turn the conquered Nazis around against the soviets right away, continuing WWII. I don't think this attitude would have changed if Stalin was a nicer guy.  If Stalin never cracked down on Trotskyism, and never assassinated Trotsky, it's conceivable that Trotsky might have supplanted him in his first moment of weakness (probably during the famines, which would've happened even if Stalin was a nice guy). Trotsky probably would have been worse for non-soviets seeing as he was a true believer in global revolution and interventionism. Churchill probably would have gotten his extended WWII, and much of post-war Europe might have been immediately 'liberated'.  The cold war would probably not have been so cold, with Trotsky openly intervening and spreading revolution throughout Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Without a terse peace, it probably would have taken the soviets even longer to develop their own nukes, perhaps until the mid-50s. The allies would probably take a similar approach as they did with Japan, nuking key soviet targets as they produced nukes, asking for surrender in between.   I'm not sure how much it'd take, but I doubt the USSR could withstand 10 years of nuking, develop their own, and return the favour. More likely is that WWII would end before the 50s, Russia would be a nuclear wasteland, and we get a unipolar world with less of a taboo on nuke usage.   From there, it's possible that recently-communist China would get a similar spanking. If the war-weary west were to leave it be, however, it's likely China would develop nukes in the beginning of a cold war, which would progress rapidly to the USA nuking that capability away. Basically, nuclear rivals would not be permitted.  The 1960s would probably still bring a wave of liberalism and protest movements, rabidly critical of the unipolar USA led-west nuking the second world into the dust. While hippies and beatniks would be calling for nuclear disarmament, the warhawks would have the doctrine of No Nuclear Rivals (NNR) instead of Mutually Assured Destruction, arguing that Pax Americana depends utterly on their primacy as a world power, and that nuclear proliferation would result in global annihilation.  The progressive faction would probably win that argument in the long run, and a slow trend of global disarmament would probably follow with all the usual hiccups (France refusing to reduce it's stockpile, Israel having a secret program, etc).

HistoryWhatIf,363ifc,Arch-duke,2,Mon May 18 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Best outcome I can imagine is Nicolas II never brutally suppresses dissent, but instead takes a progressive stance to bring Russia in-step with other contemporary constitutional monarchies. In the fair and legitimate multiparty constitutional democracy that emerges, the Bolsheviks have less fuel for their radical fire and remain a relatively fringe movement without widespread appeal. The Mensheviks instead rise to prominence with their socialistic platform of wealth redistribution to ease the extreme inequality in Russia. Russia ends up a bit like the Scandinavian states - quite religious at first, quite left, quite pacifistic.  Of course, whilst possibly being better for Russians, it's hard to guess what WWI and WWII would have been like with a Russia that opted for neutrality. WWI might not have happened at all, at least not as it did in OTL - a parliamentary Russia might not be as willing to stick up for Serbia, defusing the confrontation between Austria and Russia, and therefore Germany, and so on. Hotzendorf might have gotten his wish to go to war against Serbia without consequence (save for the embarassing consecutive defeats he'dve likely still have suffered until he won with sheer force of numbers, without a world war to also fight).  Still, it's likely the powderkeg of Europe would have erupted sooner or later, especially without widespread understanding of the horrors of industrial war. What for, though, I can't guess. Perhaps France and Germany would find some other excuse to have at it, but there's no telling when that might be. Going off how generally pro-war Western and Central Europe was, it probably wouldn't have been that long.  My best guess is that shit starts over Germany and Italy's colonial ambitions. But it might be a fair bit later. Assuming fascism still rises in Italy under Mussolini (I don't see why it wouldn't), and assuming that happens before a Great European war, Mussolini would want to delay an actual war (because Italy wasn't ready for one).   Without post WWI versailles-inflicted economic hardship and geopolitical shame, Hitler and the Nazis probably wouldn't have gained traction. Instead we'd probably see a continuation of the rather undemocratic German Empire, with powerful generals nominally under the Kaiser's authority. There'd still be political pressure for greater democratisation, as well as an active socialist movement. Lets assume no revolution, lacking an abysmal socio-economic situation to tip the country over the edge.  Without Hitler rushing him into war, Mussolini might get the time he needs to properly militarise and industrialise Italy, possibly being ready to fight some time in the 40s. As soon as Italy was ready, Mussolini would likely start flexing hard in Africa, working with Germany to do the same, probably consciously stepping on Britain and France's toes.   That's the latest I can hypothetically stall a European War. It's possible (likely?) that a war would happen much sooner, though, when Italy wasn't ready, based on Germany's increasing might, influence, and hankering for colonies (a pie Britain and France wish to exclude them from at all costs). Perhaps in the 1920s. Probably not during the Great Depression. So 1920s, or 1940s. Let's say 1920s.  Without Hitler, and with a passive Russia, it's entirely possible a showdown between Russia and Germany just never happens. This would also greatly improve Germany's chances at victory in any continental conflict. Assuming the central alliance faces off just against the entente cordiale, a horrific WWI-style war might still occur, sans an eastern-front, and no decisive outcome. Italy wouldn't be ready to sway the war one way or the other, so it doesn't really matter which side they pick. It'd probably grind into an awful war of attrition.   The Ottoman Empire would probably join as they did in OTL, the fall of their empire is probably just as inevitable, the attack on the dardanelles probably just as futile and pointless. No net impact on the outcome of the war.   So lets say the Great War starts in the 1920s, grinds on for years as old-school generals pour countless soldiers into the meatgrinder before eventually 'getting' this new kind of war. If an America joins at all, it'll probably pull out when the Great Depression strikes in 1929. What happens to the Great War when the great depression hits in the middle of it, assuming it hits pretty much everyone with comparable force? I have no idea, and would welcome suggestions.  My best guess is that after years of horrific bloodshed, public will to fight on all sides utterly vanishes. The entente and the alliance sign an armistice with virtually nothing significant gained by either side. Germany gets legitimacy for it's colonial ambitions (which it can't afford anymore), France gets Alsace and/or Lorraine back. Both sides try to play it off as a victory, but the public perception of war and the government has become drastically more cynical and critical (as it did after WWII in OTL). This Great European War actually lives up to the title 'the war to end all wars', without a skewed versailles style treaty to guarantee a round 2. Europe never goes to war like that again.  During the Great Depression, Germans (already resentful of the Kaiser and the Generals for the Great War, and hurting economically) have a socialist revolution. Ernst Thälmann is instated as Chairman of the United Communist Republics (UKR). German sponsored revolution spreads to Austria, Italy, Greece, the Balkans, and Eastern Europe.  By the 1940s, the entourage of socialist nations sign the Vienna pact, joining with the German UKR into a single Central European communist superpower. Britain, France, Spain, and the USA form NATO to halt the spread of Marxism. With populaces still against total war, a 'cold war' ensues, which lasts decades. German nuclear physicists discover the atom bomb, which they controversially used as a test and a show of force against 'Turkish Cypriot Fascists.' The international community is outraged and intimidated by this show of force. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk cedes cyprus, resisting the calls for war with the UKR.  The UKR state media pushes the Armenian Genocide story hard, bankrolling armed resistance groups in Turkey, and funding an Azeri genocide in the east. When Turkey takes action, the UKR intervenes with mass public support for a short, just war. Turkey fights back hard, but after Ankara and Izmir are nukes, Turkey capitulates. Crestfallen, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk surrenders, is trialled by the UKR, and sentenced to death for crimes against humanity. Istanbul is renamed Constantinople and reorganised into the Greek Bundesrepublik, whilst the rest of Turkey is incorporated into several smaller republiks going mainly to Armenians, Arabs, and Kurds. Turks are persecuted in the UKR henceforth.  Shortly after the fall of Turkey, a joint force of French and American scientists unlock the secret of nuclear fission, and a nuclear arms race begins. The threat of nuclear war dashes UKR hopes for a Turkey-style liberation of the middle east, and so a string of proxy wars begin there, and in South America, resulting in an array of brutal puppet states in each region.  Miraculously, the world avoids nuclear war (even despite the Corsica incident, and Haitian missile crisis). A surprise outcome to the cold war drops on the world as the UKR simply dissolves in 1981, after what is revealed to be decades of economic smoke and mirrors hiding a dysfunctional and inefficient economy."

The Muslim League becomes one of many regional parties and might get folded into a more umbrella alliance for greater decentralization or provincial autonomy - or it might not, because a lot of its support wasn't in what became Pakistan OTL, which ITTL would have a lot more Hindus, and Sindhi, Baluchi, and Pashtun politics wouldn't be subsumed to the same degree by Muhajir and Punjabi interests.  There is the possibility of violent separatism, but honestly Congress will be more inclusive with more Muslim voters, and I'm not sure Hindutva can really get off the ground without Pakistan to provide tension, so I don't think it's that likely.  Serious knock-on effects for Afghan politics and world political Islam.  The US won't be able to funnel aid to the Afghan anti-communist rebels through a unified India if it maintains its OTL (loosely pro-Soviet, non-aligned) orientation, and if India is willing to back rebels - possible, it's on their borders, they do host the Tibetan exile government - they won't be filtered to the most Islamist groups the way they were by Zia al-Huq's Pakistan.  (Unless the US goes through Iran... which could be interesting in its own right.)  An al-Qaeda is likely to exist - nothing in this prevents the Saudis from holding Mecca and Medina and being filthy rich, few al-Qaeda members are Afghans - but it won't be shaped by the same forces as OTL, and without Pakistan political Islam itself looks different, because Pakistan was one of the first Muslim states to replace secular law with sharia courts.

After the British decided to turn the question of Palestine over to the UN in 1947, they effectively relinquished their role in the territory, and once they left for good in May 1948, I doubt they would have returned as peacekeepers. Furthermore, in between the UN vote for partition in November 1947 and the departure of all British personnel the following May, the British were less inclined to keep the peace between the Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and individual British officers sought to provide an advantage for whichever side they supported by bequeathing strategic positions to one side or the other. In fact, most British officials deeply sympathized with the Arab cause, and the Arab Legion of Transjordan was trained and led by British commanders. All in all, it's highly unlikely the British would have mounted a peacekeeping operation. They were in ""let's get the fuck out of here"" mode.  Regarding the Soviet Union, at this stage of history, they were firmly pro-Zionist, and didn't switch sides until the 1950s, largely due to Cold War complications. Not only did the USSR lead the Soviet bloc in voting for partition at the UN in 1947, but they were the first state to recognize Israel de jure, which they did on May 17, 1948. Moreover, Israel would have been in dire straits were it not for the arms shipment they received from Czechoslovakia during the war, and Czechoslovakia was part of the Soviet bloc at the time.

From the fall of Carthage one strong man after another had risen, competed with the Senate and other strong men and threatened the Republic. Sulla, Marius, Pompey, Antony, Octavian, Lepidus, Crassus all abused the republican institutions for their own ends. Caesar just went further than the ones before him and became the object lesson for Octavian in what not to do so Octavian could do it successfully.  Lets say Octavian after he beats Antony rules for a few years, declines all real honors and powers offered and retires like Diocletian to go raise cabbages. The Senate comes back to power. The institutions are corrupt, votes are open bought and sold, assassination is a legitimate method to remove rivals for office. Men who seek to become Consul have private armies, they cater to the masses like Caesar did outside the scope of the Senate. Laws are changed after a man is out of office to convict him of things that were not crimes when he was in office.  Its just a matter of time before one of those men marches on Rome ""to protect his rights"", or two of them in some power sharing agreement (like Octavian and Antony) come to blows. The Civil wars start again, last for a few years, the senate rules and it starts again.   Something has to change the cycle is self destructive. Somehow the system has to become uncorrupt. The violence is the answer has to be removed. They only way that happened was the strong man in charge (Augustus) has the other strong men as real friends (Agrippa) and lived and ruled so a generation grew up knowing nothing more than one man rule.

Now, the question of growth is interesting. Many of the later Roman emperors were former generals that crowned themselves emperor by putsching the former emperor (about everytime when the dynasty changed); or they inherited the title from a dude who went ahead like this and got trained and educated accordingly.  So, Roman emperors mostly had military backgrounds (those who hadnt are mostly remembered as failures actually), thus they heavily relied on their military to stay in power and invested in it accordingly. Also, if you grow up with and are good at warfare - why change?  So yes, a Roman Republic COULD have grown like the Roman Empire did, but WOULD it?

It's notable that all these guys except Sulla aligned themselves with the common people against the aristos, and that Sulla's government was a reign of terror against the people who'd supported popular reforms. The common citizens and the aristos feared and hated each other, and with good reason.  If anything, the weird thing is that the Republic (as it existed) survived as long as it did. A military dictatorship was probably not the only way things could have gone, but the Republican system was completely incapable of dealing with its own unhappy citizens."
HistoryWhatIf,362hg9,TitusBluth,2,Fri May 15 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"Simply put, the huge roman military expansion was what led to the fall of the republic. Even in modern democracies popular and successful military leaders have a huge influence over the population (Dwight D. Eisenhower being probably the most prominent example), and in the time of the Roman Republic it was even more significant. The system (in my understanding) was tailored in such a way, that the divide between the plebs and nobles just got bigger and bigger and any attempt at change ended badly (the Gracchi are a good example), leading to even more unhappy people and undermining the democratic foundations of the Senate. Now, that may seem trivial, but truth is, for a republic to stay a republic, people have to want a republic. And at some point it seems that the roman population got well beyond the point of annoyance with the Senate. Now, every historian likes to point to a different point in time, for the ""start of the end of the Republic"". Some point Marius and his military reforms, that enabled the mustering of privet armies. Some point out Sulla, who codified the use of terror and force to deal with political opposition. Others actually believe, that Cesar wanted to reform the system and not become a monarch. Some point the simple act of expansion. It's quite complex, but the republic wasn't stable for a lot of time, before the rivalry between Cesar and Pompey screwed it enough for Octavian to basically create the Empire. While your question is really interesting, the answer is not at all clear-cut. My advise to you is to pick any of the ""point-of-change"" examples in this thread and than try changing them in a way and maybe ask what will happen if it changed in some way (Gracchi managing to push the reforms trough, Marius nat entering the picture, Sulla being disposed, Cesar surviving for longer and so on)."

In either case, the americans still win. if the prussians only send token aid, then the war lasts a bit longer but ends the same way. If they launch a full-scale invasion (against three countries, mind you), the british would be forced to divert men, materiel, and attention away from the rebelling colonies, resulting in a quicker victory for the americans.  as an aside, that's almost what ended up happening. The Treaty of Paris was signed two full years after the fighting ended in the 13 colonies because the british were still fighting the french, spanish, and dutch in their colonies. this diverted naval power and supplies away from the armies fighting the american rebels and indirectly led to an american victory."

It'd (also) be interesting to see where the private sector would be in all of this - if SpaceX is viable.

Without the competitive nature of the one-upsmanship with the Soviets, probes like Voyager, Viking, Mariner, etc. aren't going to cut it.  There would need to be a push for new vehicles that carry people, along the lines of Skylab or the space shuttle, perhaps even a semi-permanent base on the moon.

And, it has the benefit of not requiring the drumming-up of foreign wars every decade or so to keep the defense spending spigot turned up.  Eventually Congress would love it, as each and every NASA project had a 218-step manufacturing process (or 435-step process if we want there to be no debate at all) that requires either a plant or a QA facility to be built in different congressional districts.  NASA would still produce some awesome stuff, but it would also become the butt of jokes - because it would be turned into a pork-barrel project.  At some point people would call for the return to the ""good old days"" (seemingly all Good Old Days occurred someplace in the past that nobody ever remembers living in) of a leaner, meaner NASA.

HistoryWhatIf,361c7f,jaybestnz,1 point,Sun May 17 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"The current budget is down to 0.50% of GDP or $18.7B. An interesting thing which isn't taken into account is that while it is very difficult to measure accurately the true effects, several studies have indicated discounted rates of return from 33% to 43%, and include ratios from around 7 up to a 23.4 multiplier effect depending on the study, its criteria, and its methodology. Another ratio often calculated in past studies is the number of jobs created as a result of investment in NASA. The multiplier for jobs created as a result of every $1 million (2009 dollars) invested in NASA ranges from 7.86  to 19.47 over several studies conducted on this subject. This Nasa would create 827,526 jobs.  So a very solid return on investment based on economic growth and scientific advances.  What specifically? I think it is a case that any of the current inventions they have contributed would have happened, and happened a lot sooner. These developments would have also spurred other advances (Currently 1 in every thousand patents is involved with NASA in some way)  The morale would have remained very high, and inspiration for STEM would have motivated and accelerated modern technology, the impact to young kids in the 60s was massive, had that fervor continued through the 70s to today, it would have put us several decades ahead from a development perspective.    I think this would have put development pressures on the following areas: 1) Computing / microchip  2) Robotics and AI 3) Fabrics and materials (eg Teflon coating / bulletproof fibres) 4) Solar efficiency 5) Battery advancements  (SpaceX / Tesla / SolarCity is in a way developing a lot of these and  6) Jet and Rocket technology.  7) Bio monitoring  Some more unlikely / extreme inventions or scenarios 1) Possibly warp drive 2) Better understanding of gravity / possible antigravity inventions 3) Quantum computing has happened, but had this happened sooner it would have accelerated computer power / speeds  4) Need for Quantum Entanglement communication (it is real time so is currently the best candidate for how we can have connectivity to Mars).  So flow on effects, if we had developed Solar and Electric cars, say a decade or 2 earlier, then potentially the need for the Iraq war may have been reduced (we would not have been reliant on fossil fuels).   This would have sucked a lot of money out of the middle east which could have created other wars as a result but it may not have been directed at the US.  Possibly if we had done Tesla cars back in the 70s, then it is maybe not as likely that the car jobs went to Japan, so places like Detroit would be more profitable.  I cant imagine that sort of funding, without us having at least being a multi-planetary species by 70s - 80s 1) Settlement on the Moon 2) Settlement on Mars 3) Space holidays  This may have meant that by now / 90s - 2000s we could have mastered mining meteors (There are massive amounts of what are currently rare metals etc this could change development in inventions requiring these types of materials).  tl;dr more tech, faster. lots of money and jobs.  https://spinoff.nasa.gov/pdf/AIAA%202011%20Quantifying%20Spinoff%20Benefits.pdf  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/feb/01/nasa-budgets-us-spending-space-travel  https://spinoff.nasa.gov/"

It always has, every time anyone has tried to invade Russia, it has failed. Secondly, the only reason the Maoists were in any position to fight the nationalist Chinese is because the Soviets had first declared war on Japan, and had occupied vast swaths of Japanese-China. They later handed it over to Mao. During the 30s, the communist chinese were holed up in a small patch of mountain in central china.  All that out of the way, I don't expect the Reich to last longer than the mid-50s. Stalin was a smart guy, he knew how to prevent insurrections against him, he maintained stability in the Soviet Union, and he was un-idological enough to look at the world through mostly (he was a paranoid fucker) un-tinted lenses. Hitler was not. Hitler was bound to do something to agitate the Allies at some point, and his unflinching confidence in Germany wasn't going to help. He didn't invade the USSR because he had calculated the decision and thought it was best, he did it because he hated communism and thought that Germany could crush Russia with ease. Hitler's hubris was what won the war for the allies.  But let's assume that the fairy in Hitler's toothbrush mustache keeps him in check. Hitler was not the most healthy guy. Even if he hadn't committed suicide in '45, he wasn't going to live to see 1960. The problem is that the Nazi party was staffed by clever backstabbers. Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Hess, even Bormann were smart fuckers, and arguably just manipulated the less intelligent Hitler because of the population's devotion to him. Once Adolf dies, it's gonna be one bloody power struggle to see who the next Fuhrer is going to be, and whoever it is is going to have crippled the Party, the government, and possibly the country. After that, Germany would be easy pickings. Assuming that some sort of insurrection to overthrow the Nazis doesn't come from within, you can bet your ass that the UK or US is going to try to set up a Coup, or just declare war outright. Russia and the Central to Eastern-European states may split away, Japan is probably gonna hop ship, it would be a mess and the Reich isn't gonna survive to see the end of it.  BONUS: Now this would never happen. Hitler and Stalin fucking haaaaaaaated each other. Asking them to have a cold war is like asking an IRA Catholic and a Protestant Belfast Unionist to talk out their differences politely. As for the war, it could go either way. Hitler refused to listen to his generals, and Stalin just murdered his, so it'll be a crapshoot, up to which countries were conquered by which power,"

Hitler would get his Reich for a decade or so (before he died or went mad), anti-establishment ideologies, nationalist breakaway movements, and the resistance would grow and grow and grow. The West would naturally fund and propagate these movements. Atrocities would be committed in Europe (if genocide wasn't committed against marginalised, scapegoat groups in WWII, it'd happen now).

HistoryWhatIf,35zltr,Arch-duke,6,Thu May 14 21:05:20 2015 UTC,It's really difficult for me to imagine the Napoleons gripping so tightly to central control that they dissolve into bloodshed. Based on what I understand of his governing style and ready delegation to Marshals he would probably have tolerated nationalist movements. The Napoleonic Code was pretty chill and as Emperor of Europa instead of a member of a large extended family ruling almost on a whim of the people these movements would have seemed a lot less destabilizing than they did to OTL monarchs. Unless these nationalist movements demanded the restoration of local royalty or found French primacy so completely intolerable that they demanded military control of their own provinces I doubt that your Napoleon II trend of relegating certain civil autonomies would stop even under threat of a global British Empire. A France with Gold and Sugar from South America is a France that's achieved so much compared to OTL that it's a little insane to contemplate.

What do you think the implications of a Napoleonic victory at Trafalgar would have been?"
HistoryWhatIf,35zltr,monswine,1 point,Fri May 15 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"Okay so somehow Villeneuve or some other French, maybe Spanish Admiral pulls it off. Let's say Villeneuve had better follow-through this time around and acted on his suspicions instead of vacillating. Nelson is dead, the Victory is now a French prize of war. Collingwood is limping back to Gibraltar with most of his damaged ships sunk by the OTL storm. The French and Spanish return to Cadiz to await Rosily and fresh orders from Napoleon. The storm prevents them from playing clean up anyway.   Napoleon has just smashed the Austrians at Ulm when he finally learns of the British defeat. News reaches London from Gibraltar that the British fleet is all but lost. British Convoys are redirected from the Mediterrannean to reinforce and resupply Collingwood's line at Gibraltar. At all costs the French are not to escape the Mediterannean. Napoleon begins mobilizing the Grande Armee towards Denmark.   Rosily replaces an exhausted Villeneuve as head of the French and Spanish fleet and they sail for Gibraltar to break British control of the Mediterrannean.   The death of the hero of the Nile and the smashing of his fleet at Trafalgar has heavily disheartened the British. Napoleon has won a decisive victory on land and a decisive victory at sea. He seems master of the continent, already awaiting an imminent invasion before Trafalgar the people brace themselves. The Government relocated to Scotland on news of Nelson's defeat. Cornwallis simultaneously prays for and dreads a Channel Storm.  Rosily's crews are inexperienced and heavily reinforced by soldiers but they also just defeated the most powerful Navy in the world and they have Napoleon's confidence in their new commander. Collingwood is literally surrounded. He fights to the last man. The French head for the Channel. The evacuation of London begins.  The Channel is littered with the remains of ships. The guns at Dover have been firing for days. The British Channel fleet is out manned and outgunned but their experience shows. They have only small ships left now but their constant skirmishing raids have cost the French fleet dearly. Still the unthinkable happens and the French form a beachhead. The French keep unloading soldiers even in fishing boats from the mainland but the losses are horrific. It's a Pyrrhic victory but the French take Dover. The Channel is won.  The Bulk of Napoleon's armee arrives on barges from Denmark. Villeneuve is heading their escorts and defeats Cornwallis in a final confrontation on the way. With his troops on British soil Napoleon's army marches for London.  It's winter but supplies from nearby France, with total control of the Channel keep his men fed and clothed. His men however have been either in the bellies of warships or stationed on the coast for weeks and do not treat the English well at first. The British army can't stop the March and are forced to abandon London. Chaos erupts as French troops sack London. Fires burn in the city but eventually control is restored. By New Years Day Napoleon has consolidated his control of England.  He offers terms across the Scottish border. Too bitter a pill to swallow, the British refuse and begin preparing for the inevitable Summer invasion of Scotland. Napoleon, however, is eager to end this quickly and return home. Too many men died taking the Channel and he needs his army back in Europe or the cat will have been away too long. The Portuguese, the Ottomans, North Africa and the Colonies still need looking after. He brutally slaughters and sets fire to Wales. The evacuation, the series of defeats, and now the slaughter have proven too much for King George III. (You can do this however you want, either he surrenders in fear that his mental illness will incapacitate him at a crucial moment before the war is over or he relapses and the regency by his son and heir is established earlier than OTL and George IV/Prince of Wales surrenders and abdicates on his father's behalf.)  He offers terms and the British accept. He meets with King George III who surrenders and abdicates.   Napoleon has accomplished his goals. He successfully renegotiates treaties with his allies (leveraging his complete supremacy over the land and sea) and brings the Scandinavian states peacefully into the fold). He establishes his legal code throughout Europe and creates a permanent council of his variously appointed Marshals to meet in Paris and rule Europe under him.  The number of ships redirected to Europe has resulted in renewed lawlessness and rebellion in the colonies. Desperately in need of resources and money Napoleon organizes Spanish, French, and British fleets to regain any control lost.   Napoleon dies bestride the globe, invincible, Emperor of Europe. His heirs however relinquish political control to the people and focus on rebuilding. Natural resources flow in from the colonies and within a generation new Imperial schools are established throughout Europe and the ravaged farmlands and capitals are restored. As a generation who never experienced being conquered grows into power they begin to feel the chafe of the Imperial yoke and Napoleon's heirs who never experienced conquering acquiesce and restore the national assemblies and parliaments. The Imperials retain control over the Military and vast sums of money and tracts of land but over time Europe becomes a republic. The Marshals eventually produce local noble lines that all swear fealty to the Imperial line.   By 2015 I'd say the various European noble houses hold very little power that isn't symbolic and the Imperial house founded by Napoleon has just as much power. The abolishment of the old nobility of Europe (any remaining was probably married into the Imperial line) would probably be followed by the formation of larger states in Central and Eastern Europe based on ethnicity or language for ease of central governing from Paris. The colonies are still ruled by Imperially appointed governors though many of these have become figureheads as well with local politics being handled by local republican parliaments.   La Francophonie, The British Commonwealth, and Las Hispanias for the closest thing that exists to a United Nations. The Middle-East is Dominated by Ottoman influence, Asia by Chinese and Russian interests. African states are probably a lot like modern French oversees holdings. The people there (including non-whites) are accorded Imperial rights and citizenship, but instead of sending delegates to a national assembly in Paris the language-group based multinational organizations have formed quasi African coalition parliaments to address certain concerns. South America still speaks Spanish and Portuguese.   The USA seems like the wild card here to me. I don't foresee Imperial Europe meddling in Asia any more than it did in OTL but the USA is surrounded by Imperial colonies and if it threatens to alter the way of life of Mexicans and Canadians too much it could mean serious sense of danger to the Americans and that means war. My feeling is that for a while the Spanish, even with Imperial help, won't be able to hold New Spain without many more people. As the Americans spread west some of the land claimed by American settlers could just go unchallenged by the Spanish and default to the US as the population grows. the west coast and the South would stay Spanish. The Imperials might retake New Orleans to control the Gulf but it might not make sense to risk destroying the alliance with the Americans, especially after just selling it to them. After claiming Oregon Territory the Americans in this ATL might still buy Alaska from Russia, especially since they'd be even more eager for Pacific harbours.   I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of stuff here. There are bound to be more conflicts and wars than I'm accounting for. I love peaceful transitions but there are probably a few more fractures, schisms, and beheadings involved in an Imperial future of Europe."

National liberation movements in Vietnam, Indonesia, etc. now occupy a greater proportion of their respective countries than in OTL, possibly the entirety of them with a few last-ditch Japanese holdouts hoping for better treatment if the surrender to the returning colonial power instead of the locals.  USA policymakers are torn between helping the colonial powers retake these places from the Godless Commie Menace (thereby shoring up their relations with these allies) and recognizing the brave and patriotic Freedom Fighters that liberated themselves from the yoke of Japanese tyranny, just as in OTL. I'm kinda torn as to which impulse wins; on the one hand, the alliances are probably going to be even more important than in OTL, plus they'll be under a lot of pressure from hardline anti-Communists in Congress and the press. On the other, retaking these places now looks way more expensive in terms of lives and materiel, coming out of a war that's been even more expensive and destructive.  Whatever happens there, we'll inevitably have a conventional war between a USA led NATO and SEATO like alliance and a Soviet led alternate Warsaw Pact. Who wins is largely a matter of exact timing. I'll go with a late '40s start, as KMT forces invade the former Soviet, now Chinese Communist controlled regions of China. After a few weeks of heming and hawing, NATO joins in.  After some early successes, NATO analog forces in Continental Europe basically roll over and die. US and British forces (and some token continentals) are evacuated by sea under air cover. Continental governments set up shop in conveniently located offshore territories (think Taiwan). Western Europe goes Red. In Asia, the KMT fares no better and rapidly loses control of the country under a combined conventional and guerrilla counter-offensive by the CCP. Soviet occupation forces in Japan were knocked out early in the game and our NATO analogue now controls a chain of islands from the Kurils to Taiwan.  Analog NATO and analog WP are both exhausted and agree to a ceasefire that becomes permanent. the continental governments in exile protest but are almost entirely irrelevant at this point.

There is no reason to think they wouldn't do so again. As the population of the southern colonies grew the easier it becomes to recruit the numbers needed. The later in history Canada tries for Independance the less those units would be supplemented by a units of Regulars from the British Isles to put down the rebellion. In short the British would have recruited massive numbers of Americans (compared to the numbers of available Canadians) marched north and under British officers squashed the rebellion, ""all before Christmas"".  Of course this act in itself may have repercussions. Just like the South Africans saw the Zulu War as a sign they could rebel and get away with it, the Americans might take the reliance on American troops to squash Canada as a sign they could do the same, but succeed and possibly take Canada with them a generation later."

HistoryWhatIf,35yg6m,HobbitFoot,3,Thu May 14 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"Names are often different when you change languages. For example: in the Spanish, French, and Portuguese languages Germany is still named after the barbarian tribe Alemanni. In Italian, and Romanian however it's Germania. In many languages it's related to Deutschland but there are slavic names that are unrelated. A place name also sometimes has a meaning aside from the sound it makes. Before it took on it's modern spelling (and borders) England really was Land of the Angles and it's French and Spanish names are proper translations Angleterre and Inglaterra. Europeans and their neighbors had thousands of years to get acquainted with each other and their languages, when you suddenly introduce one sphere of influence to another in the Age of Exploration and later names get weirder. If you're translating a language that uses logograms where each one can represents both a sound and an idea then which do you pick? In general Europeans have gone for replicating the sounds but it's often done crudely and over time as both languages and their mutual understanding evolves we're forced to update them. The Portuguese arrive in India  and returned with tales of a city they called Bombaim. Hundred years later and the British claim it as Bombay. and in 1995 for political and cultural reasons it gets changed to Mumbai. The same city has names in Arabic and Sanskrit that are even older. My point is that it's not just purely historical reasons that a particular name is popular, sometimes there's a language barrier between invaders so profound they can't even be pronounced right. English-speakers have a hard time with silent letters in French and Spanish (or get derided by their peers as pretentious or condescending for using them appropriately) and Japan is not what they call themselves but how the Portuguese understood the Malaysians and Chinese. It's coincidence that we don't all say Nippon or even Nihon. That Quebec isn't spelled Kebek (thus preventing the ridiculous but now considered acceptable pronunciation of ''Kwebek'' or even ''Kvebek'')  Personally it makes me feel clever sometimes when I figure it out (or its obvious) but sometimes if I'll rack my brain trying to decipher the place names of a completely fantastical novel or short story and then feel like a fool.

Nixon-era policies on unions get tough after the Japanese begin eating America's lunch in the face of the oil crisis.  This requires much haranguing of Congress, but skyrocketing oil prices eventually force their hand.  The UAW is busted, and the big three are able to retool and adapt by the late 70s, thus keeping Japanese auto makers a much smaller share of the U.S. market.  As such, there is less need to move or outsource the auto industry to elsewhere, or for the big three to severely downsize."
HistoryWhatIf,360h79,southernbeaumont,1 point,Fri May 15 02:28:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Detroit was in decline as much from factories relocating to other states as it was from foreign competition in the automobile industry. By 1970, just shy of the oil crisis, Detroit's population had already decreased by almost 20% from a high of 1.8 million in the 1950s to 1.5 million because the automakers had already largely moved out of Detroit by the mid 1960s.  Ford and other companies decentralized from Detroit across the USA in order to both escape the union-lead strikes and to find lower wage skilled employees. At the same time they also closed down the Detroit factories and did not open new ones. To quote Wikipedia:   The major auto plants left in Detroit were closed down, and their workers increasingly left behind. When the auto industry's facilities moved out, there were dramatically adverse ripple economic effects on the city. The neighborhood businesses that had catered to auto workers shut down. This direct and indirect economic contraction caused the city to lose property taxes, wage taxes, and population (and thus consumer demand). The closed auto plants were also often abandoned in a period before strong environmental regulation, causing the sites to become so-called ""brownfields,"" unattractive to potential replacement businesses because of the pollution hang-over from decades of industrial production.[11] The pattern of the deteriorating city by the mid-1960s was visibly associated with the largely departed auto industry.   ""Busting the UAW"", as you say, was what caused Detroit's decline rather than being what would prevent it.  You'd need unions having a little more foresight and realizing that too high of a wage demand would drive the automakers as well as not being so quick to strike. And that has to happen before 1950, Detroit's peak size.  A business's obligation is to increase the returns to it's stockholders, so even with perfectly reasonable wage demands from the unions and few strikes, relocation to other states, Ontario or Mexico would still be attractive as the wage demands in those locations would be less than in Detroit. Somebody in the corps would see that potential to increase margins by paying the workers less and the decentralization would begin anyway. The best that one can accomplish without finding something plausible that would actually make the decentralization more costly is that one can only slow the shrinkage of Detroit as not as horribly adversely affected as it was in real life so that it can stand a chance of switching to a mostly service-based economy like so many other cities in North America have done."

Now, it only has ~700k, so the 4 cities you pick in option 1) with ~300k, ~460k, ~600k and ~310k would require an even steeper decline than what actually happened. A pattern like Pittsburgh, Cleveland or Buffalo would have left Detroit with somewhere between 900k and 1M people today, eyeballing graphs on Google.  Option 2) requires stuff happening by around 1950, for as I mention in another comment that by 1960 when the Corvair debuted, Detroit's decline due to fleeing automakers was already well under way. The Corvair, by the way, was never actually built in Detroit. Some were built in Ypsilanti, just out side of Detroit, and some in Flint but most were built outside of Michigan.  In option 3), the reason the local government was ""abdicating its duty to keep civil order"" was because the flight of the auto factories caused two things. First, was the general shrinkage of the economy due to people leaving. Less people means less taxes which means less for police, but since less people also means you need less police it could have been doable though the spread out nature of the declining population would make it more difficult for police to cover and therefore a bit more expensive to do so compared to a geographically smaller city with the same population size. Also, the people who did stay paid less in property taxes thanks to sharply declining property values so the municipal income dropped even more than it would have from just the people and their economic activity leaving. It was a one-two punch that left the city severely suffering and I'm not sure they could have done much else."

(That way, Detroit wouldn't grow as explosively in the 1910s-1920s and would therefore not overtake Cleveland in population.)  There could be a certain auto industry in Detroit and other Michigan cities, but the auto industry in the US would be distributed more evenly, in more cities than just Detroit, Flint, Lansing, Ypsilanti, etc. (e.g. in Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Buffalo).  So, sort of the way the steel industry was distributed in more than just Pittsburgh and other Western Pennsylvania towns, like in Cleveland, Youngstown, Gary, Buffalo, and indeed Detroit.

My original question was inspired by my reading of it, as it provides an alternative theory on why the Six-Day War happened, which is that the USSR instigated the war as a pretext for preemptively destroying Israel's nuclear facilities. I found it to be a fascinating read, and it challenged many of my assumptions about the Six Day War, and I would highly recommend it.  I think that it's highly unlikely that the Soviets would have bombed Dimona unprovoked due to the reaction this would have invited from the USA and the potential for a nuclear exchange between the two countries, something that the USSR was keenly interested in avoiding. Yet, one of the things that Ginor and Remez provide enormous evidence for is the fact that Soviet pilots flew reconnaissance missions over Dimona before the war, implying that it was viewed as a viable target by the Soviet Politburo. I definitely don't think a preemptive, unprovoked strike was likely, but I also don't think it could have never happened, and I think it's interesting to consider what might have happened if it did."

HistoryWhatIf,35tl3u,OB1_kenobi,7,Wed May 13 12:02:46 2015 UTC,"Well, interestingly enough the technology was sort-of already available  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_phone  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mobile_phones   In 1949 AT&T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis in 1946, AT&T then introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30 000 calls each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to depress a button on the handset to talk and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 36 kg.[11]  Subscriber growth and revenue generation were hampered by the constraints of the technology. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time.[12] Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing 15 USD per month, plus 0.30 to 0.40 USD per local call, equivalent to about 176 USD per month and 3.50 to 4.75 per call in 2012 USD.[11]   So the product existed, and there was plenty of demand.  However, the problems of roaming and standards needed to be addressed before cellular service could take off.  But, suppose that AT&T cracks that technological problem with the aid of transistors and computerized billing systems.  They take a big risk putting in place infrastructure.  Limited to urban areas it takes off among wealthy city dwellers.  The US is big, and it is expnsive to cover the sheer land area in cellular service.  Even for AT&t of the 1960's.    Because the tech is still heavy and bulky, they are restricted to cars at first.  Or, heavy briefcase things carried by someone in your entourage, if you were an important business person.  Urban car phones are a hit - they are great for construction workers, traveling salesmen, inspection engineers - professionals who need to work out of their vehicles.  AT&T is a big, conservative, risk-averse organization, and it rolls out the service slowly.  But this cautious approach allows it to make sure to maximize profits.    City centers, airports and other areas where people and businesses who can afford the $100+ a month service live and work get the services.  Suburbs and rural areas not so much.  Business people decide that they want the convenience of their cell phones all the time.  They re-colonize the city centers, that had been abandoned in post-war flights to the suburbs.  The middle class sees that city centers are the new destination and prices for real-estate in the cities rises quickly.  Luckily there are plenty of contractors who can organize themselves with cellular telephone service to help revitalize and renovate the inner-city residential areas.  Poor and minority people are forced out to the now less popular suburbs.    By the mid-1970's when oil embargoes happen, it's still bad, but not horrific for commuters, who can just take city busses and other mass transit to work.  Poor people in the benighted suburbs can't make it into work any more, loose jobs, and become poorer.  Cities become shiny beacons of wealth, and nobody goes out of town, except far out of town on vacations to the country."

The Romans themselves used them early on and moved away from them into the more flexible classical maniple and cohort formations because those more flexible formations were much better for broken terrain. The Romans fought directly against those tactics when fighting great generals like Pyrrhus of Epirus and won.   Later era legions fought the phalanxes of the Seleucid army, won ""clear Roman victory"" and caused the Seleucids to start training men in the Roman fashion because it was more effective.  If Alexander persists in using phalanxes he is going to lose in the end. He will do well but like Pyrrhus (considered by Hannibal to be second only to Alexander)  he is going to get beaten by men whose names most people never heard of (Publius Valerius Laevinus and Publius Decius Mus).

I just think it is an interesting discussion to go through historical documents and sources and try to form an opinion on it. Personally I think the theory does seem to have some merit and historical standing, even if it is not in the end correct (again, I don't know). The later Hellenestic armies certainly had a weaker cavalry contingent than Alexander's armies, and the entire Phalanx military system was highly dependent on a successful cavalry charge.   The fact that Pyrrhus had a better cavalry than the later Hellenistic armies, and that he subsequently did much better against the Romans than later Greek armies, seems to give the theory even more merit. The question then becomes comparing Alexander's cavalry to Pyrrhus's. Considering that the Macedonian and Thesselian cavalry was probably better than the Epiroite cavalry, I think it quite possible that Alexander's cavalry was superior in quality than that of Pyrrhus.  Of course, we have to also remember that the Roman army that Pyrrhus faced was not the prime Roman army. The Marian reforms certainly improved the legions."

HistoryWhatIf,35qcuz,svarogteuse,14,Tue May 12 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"what else does an army predominantly made up of pike and horse do to beat a legion?   It doesn't thats the point I was trying to make. Your Alexandrian general is going to have to stop being an Alexandrian general and be a Roman era general with Roman era forces. Pikes and massed phalanx formations vs the Roman legions is a losing situation. He can just throw the pikes away. The horse need to be armed with bows and converted to look something more like the Parthians or Huns. The only way the lesser tech army wins is by changing tactics to those like the newer army, those that defeated that army, or hoping the newer army so screws up its general goes down in history like Elphinstone. If the Romans are dumb enough to fight the phalanx on a flat plain with additional impassable terrain to guard the flanks of its static formations, send their allied cavalry somewhere else, deprive their troops of food, water and sleep then the phalanx has a chance.   Even then its unlikely that battle would happen. The Romans by the time of Caesar are professionals. The Roman general is going to have on hand advice from 20 year veterans of the army not to fight the phalanx under situations where the phalanx will win. And being the man he has to be by that point he is going to take that advice. That man served under more experienced men before being given command and had a political career to get where he is. Caesar joined the army some 30 years before he became a famous general.  Military tribune is the first office men generally run for and hold. Later political offices provide higher level military command. A Roman general in Caesars time  has both military and political experience before he gets an army. Even if the general in charge wants to fight some 20 year old veteran is going to step in and tell him to wait till tomorrow and move to a better location where they are not at a disadvantage.  Alexanders generals by contrast were his fellow nobles and boyhood friends. They may have been a group of exceptional individuals but exceptionalism only goes so far against professionalism. They were the higher tech army vs the Persians. They aren't against the Romans."

But I will give some comments on the tactics, just to drive home the point that this is not how things would have gone, not even in this elaborate what-if scenario.    It's widely known that the sarissa phalanx failed against Rome because of it's unmaneuverability, (...) I set up one long, single line of sarissas    That's one long, single line of unmaneuverable forces, exactly the same as all those formations the Roman army has defeated dozens of times in the past.   I load the left flank with silver shields   The hypaspists were an elite unit, but they were essentially just hoplites. Their equipment is the equipment the Roman army moved away from right around the time the hypaspists were making their name (250 years before Caesar). Roman legionaries would still be more maneuverable than the hypaspists.   I put the rest of my horse in the middle to exploit any gaps in the Roman lines   Isn't that where the long, single line of sarissas is? Or do you mean in the middle of the reserve units? How would they get to the gaps that are to be explointed then?   I stock up on lots of machinery of war   More unmaneuverable things!   Rome's notoriety for the testudo formation   It wasn't used as often as you seem to think. It was used mostly in sieges and against the Parthians, who would outmaneuver the legions. Your unmaneuverable setup is not going to outmaneuver the Romans, so a testudo wouldn't be needed.   When they go to throw their pila   At that point they are so close that they'll follow-up with a charge to get into hand-to-hand combat."

This is the origin of the Ukraine crisis. Moreover, the only parts of the Former USSR in Europe to not be in the EU are Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus (unless you want to also count Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, but that makes Turkey's exclusion from Europe even more problematic). Belarus is a staunch ally of Putin while Ukraine is well, Ukraine.   That being said, I'm not sure it would set any precedent, much of Putin's appeal in Russia is that he is standing against Europe and the US. Backing down from the West, repeatedly would make him look more like Gorbachev who's largely seen as having capitulated to the West. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, Russia hoped that NATO would be dissolved, perhaps in favour of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But NATO didn't dissolve, it expanded and gobbled up former Russian satellites, regions that had been dominated by Russia for centuries. Russia saw this and still sees it as a threat. Putin capitulating to the West's demands in 2008 would have been anathema to Russian foreign policy thinking and the rising nationalist sentiment amongst many Russians. If anything, it would mean that domestic pressure inside Russia would force whoever is in charge to call the West's bluff eventually, otherwise there probably would have been another coup attempt a la 1991. If the West didn't follow through on its threat of retaliation, then Russia knows it can operate with impunity, if it did follow through, then its war.  That's why Russia will tease the Baltic states (Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia), they know that since the Baltics are in NATO a direct invasion or tacit support for major unrest like in Ukraine can lead to the invoking of Article 5 of the NATO treaty and thus war. So Russia won't try to make many direct incursions, it'll just fuck with them. But since Ukraine and Georgia aren't NATO members, Russia can operate more freely because there is no binding legal document that would bring about war. The fact that there are ethnic Russians in both countries gives Russia cover to play the humanitarian even though they're effectively operating in a ""period preparatory to war"".   Now, you may ask why wouldn't this give Ukraine and Georgia more incentive to join NATO, well aside from the identity divisions in both countries, there's the fact that Europe still gets a lot of its oil either from Russia or through Russia, especially Germany. And Europe isn't going to want to piss off their energy supply for a few ex-Soviet states that would end up receiving development aid from Northern and Western Europe while also competing with other EU nationals for jobs, especially as the Great Recession was imminent in August 2008. That's also why Obama had to do a lot of coaxing to get Merkel on board for additional sanctions against Russia last year."

Georgia was already being seriously considered as an additional member to NATO, Bush even suggested making a new fast track program just for them but due to its lack of a precedent and how it would likely irritate Russia, the leaders of France and Germany at the time convinced him to abandon the idea.  The invasion itself happened only months before they were going to formally begin the actual process and, seemingly, was primarily done to prevent that from happening and also keep Europe's oil supplied by Russia (the EU was building a pipeline from Azerbaijan through Georgia, which has since been dismantled).  While their NATO membership would not cause any conflict with Turkey (who is already a member), them becoming an EU member would probably cause a few issues."

For those who don't know Usenet (gerrof my lawn), it's a decentralised mechanism for discussion forums and public sharing of binaries (usually porn or software). It occupied the market space that /., Digg and Reddit successively took over, but it is rather more general in its capability. So I would expect Usenet to remain prominent for longer.  I'm not sure that HTTP was critical. There were some other hypertext transport protocols, and Gopher could have been extended. HTTP succeeded partly because it was fairly well designed, and partly because Tim Berners-Lee was very good at the politics of getting a vendor-neutral protocol accepted (and here I mean ""politics"" in a good sense). However only part of HTTP took off - for instance we use the GET verb all the time, but I don't think that PUT is even implemented by most web browsers and servers. Originally HTTP was more intended for sharing and saving documents, but of course it was taken up as a mechanism of content distribution primarily.  HTTP may have been more important, but HTML may have been more important. Again, there were several hypertext representations, such as Apple's Hypercard, but HTML had the advantage of being vendor-neutral and text based (hence easy to generate and debug). We might have ended up with something more like RTF or PostScript.  The other possibility is a set of proprietary walled gardens. I mentioned /., Digg and Reddit as successively occupying the ""user-oriented news and discussion"" niche. Prior to that I'd say that CIS (Compuserve) occupied the discussion niche, while AOL was more like Yahoo! today - both being incompatible walled gardens. There were other similar closed environments like MSN. We might have seen a consolidation - in fact AOL did buy Compuserve, but too late to matter much. So we might have ended up with one or two massive walled gardens for content, just as we have only a few app stores today."

Nowadays, modern browsers will also use OPTIONS for CORS checks.  Most servers will accept a PUT (or any verb) even if the web application itself doesn't use of that verb.    I do disagree with saying ""only part of HTTP took off,"" for one the varying verb choice is only a small part of HTTP, things like chunked encoding, headers, status codes, or persistent connections are much more important parts of HTTP.  Secondly, verbs tend to be used a lot more in RESTful APIs, which in recent years have become the primary standard for web based APIs.  Not all of them use PUT or PATCH (although a more complete API will), but DELETE for one is quite useful and popular.  But overall I agree, if there was no HTTP something else would have come along.

Once the Germans took the heat off the air fields, the RAF got stronger and more able to inflict losses on the Luftwaffe.  The second factor was that British war production and personnel training quickly became very focused on the air force and air defences.  The Germans were much less focused on air power and never became nearly as oriented towards turning out new planes and new pilots.  Had the Germans believed that the coming battle was going to be close-fought, they would have been able to bring far more air power to bear.  Finally, Hitler had a ""cut his losses"" attitude to Britain.  He was an impatient man and was already thinking of his coming battle against the USSR.

So we get all these instances of airfields being absolutely decimated by bombings but within 12 hours they're up and running again...because they're just giant strips of dirt and not asphalt strips.   The fact of the matter is is that even before the Lustwaffe made the switch the attrition favored the RAF. In Max Hasting's Inferno;   Both air forces wildly overestimated the damage they inflected on each other. But the Germans’ intelligence failure was far more serious, because it sustained their delusion that they were winning. Fighter Command’s stations were targeted by forty Luftwaffe raids during August and early September, yet only two—Manston and Lympne on the Kent coast—were put out of action for more than a few hours, and the radar recievers were largely spared from attention. By late August the Luftwaffe believed Fighter Command’s first-line strength had been halved, to 300 aircraft. In reality, however, Dowding still deployed around twice that number: attrition was working to the advantage of the British. Between 8 and 23 August, the RAF lost 204 aircraft, but during that month 476 new fighters were built, and many more repaired. The Luftwaffe lost 397, of which 181 were fighters, while only 313 Bf-109s and Bf-110s were produced by German factories. Fighter Command lost 104 pilots killed in the middle fortnight of August, against 623 Luftwafffe airmen dead or captured. (Pg 85-86, emphasis mine)   Further,   The war of attrition took its toll from July 1940 to the end of the battle in early October. German fighter strength fell from 725 to 275.

It's almost comical the extent to which both sides did that.   The fact is is that the reason the Luftwaffe stopped targeting the airfields was because it wasn't working.   There are certainly a range of views on that topic.  I presented one view (my first of three points) and you presented another view.   Ultimately the ""Battle of Britain"" was an impossible victory for Germany outside the realm of pure fantasy.   If you mean victory in the air by autumn 1940 with the way they were conducting it (or with minor tweaks), I'd agree.  On the other hand, if Germany was willing to delay its attack on the USSR until 1943 or later and put the extensive resources of most of continental Europe towards an air war with Britain, along with landing craft to support an invasion, then I don't agree.  Had the Americans considerably stepped up support during an extended campaign through 1942 and on, then I think Britain could have staved off the Germans.  But with half-hearted American support, I'd favour the Germans."

Severe long-term economic hardship and Soviet imperialism causes the Iron curtain to fall over the whole of continental Europe. The US is unable to fund its nuclear or space programs, leading them to be completely outclassed by the USSR by 1952. Communist regimes start popping up across the world with the US and UK being the few Democratic holdouts by 1956. In 1961, the Soviet Union invades the US citing its mistreatment of workers and other norms established in the Communist dominated international community. With a small defensive military, the US quickly falls and a Marxist-Leninist government is installed as a Soviet puppet state. A strong insurgency lasts for about 5 years, but is eventually brutally crushed.  Deficit spending is not a bad thing. Governments and corporations need to do it because some goods and services create value much better than money, thus taking on debt to pay for them is profitable in the long run. You can even be in the red every year and still be making huge profit. It's a completely different monster from personal finance."

HistoryWhatIf,35hh7m,Volsunga,3,Mon May 11 03:37:12 2015 UTC,"Alice has $2400. Bob has $0 and borrows $1200 from Alice. Bob buys a widget maker for $800 and $400 worth of scrap metal. Now Alice has $1200 and Bob has -$1200 in debt to Alice. Bob and Alice agree that he will pay her back in monthly installments of $100. Bob uses his widget maker to turn $10 worth of scrap into a $50 widget in a week. He sells his widgets and makes more than the amount of money per month he needs to make his payments to Alice. At the end of the year, Alice has $2400 and Bob has $800 ($2000 minus his $1200 paid debt). Alice has the same money she started with, but Bob has significantly more than he started with because he took on debt to invest in infrastructure to make widgets.  So now, Bob uses his $800 to buy another widget maker, borrows $1200 from Alice again (using the same payment plan) to buy a third widget maker and $400 worth of scrap. Bob can now turn $30 of scrap into $150 in widgets every week. He still only has to pay Alice $100 every month, but has $600 in revenue. When he starts running low on scrap he starts buying it on a monthly basis to keep his widget makers running at full capacity. At the end of the second year, Alice has $2400 and Bob has $5440.  Now in reality, Bob would be more regularly taking on debt to get more widget makers and continue to be able to exceed his monthly payments on the debt because widget makers create so much value. It is is his interest to stay continually in debt so he can make and sell widgets at huge profits and an exponential rate.  Now this example is ignoring interest and inflation, which simply changes the threshold at which a piece of infrastructure is worth taking on debt to invest in. The model remains basically the same.  Disclaimer: not an accountant, so I might have some terminology wrong and there's definitely some higher level concepts that go into these kinds of calculations, but the basic idea that managed debt creates wealth is pretty universal."

Now you could make them all slaves and compel them to work by force, as this also does work. However, the degree of resentment imparted in that way chokes your performance pretty severely.  This is why the carrot and stick approach is what was done. Promise people a winning condition but put it behind a huge amount of work that needs to be completed to reach that condition, e.g. American dream. Automation is making that increasingly untenable so we are starting to see how society needs to change to reflect that.   That all said, at the end of the day the deficit is an illusion.

Germany would've imposed heavy sanctions on France and Britain, both stripped of their empire and colonies. I think they might have been a bit more lenient to Britain, but France was Prussia and Germany's old enemy. Britain probably survives, but France goes into economic turmoil. They can't afford reparation payments, their morale is at a catastrophic low after a second military defeat (and probably loss of more territory) to Germany. Extremism grows, to either the left or right, but I think they would have gone down a similar path as Germany did in OTL. Fascism grows in France, a far-right party gains power, urging an immediate halt of reparation payments and all production towards improving the economy and remilitarisation. France doesn't produce as much as Germany or have as much economic improvement as Germany did in the 1930s, but I can see another French–German war. There wouldn't be a Holocaust (saying that, anti-semitism was rife in the French royalist and nationalist movements in the late 19th century, so there may have been persecution of Jews in France).  Russia still becomes the Soviet Union and probably remains isolated until the 1930s. The United States, defeated in World War I, probably decides to remain isolated as well, but they slowly come back into the world as they did in OTL during the 1920s. Britain falls behind and loses its status as the world superpower more quickly after Germany strips them of their empire. Irish independence presumably, along with independence of many of their colonies. I expect Germany would take most of the French and British colonies in Africa.   Austro-Hungary remains a little bit longer after the war, but they and the Ottomans are pretty much doomed and their empires split in the 1920s.   I find a German victory in 1918 one of the more fascinating alt-histories, because it would change so much. What is undoubtable is that Germany would become a world superpower after the war."
HistoryWhatIf,35hqxs,UtterNutterButter,1 point,Mon May 11 18:32:46 2015 UTC,"I'll do the Near and Middle East, 1918 divergence.  The Ottoman Empire keeps its territories, augmented by the former British protectorates in the Arabian peninsula, and nearly comes to blows with its erstwhile allies over the partition of the Balkans and Ukraine. Its only major gain is the return of Libya, offered as a sort of consolation prize at the Berlin Convention of 1919. This paltry gain in comparison to its vast human losses and public perception of betrayal by its allies lead to a catastrophic loss in confidence in the Caliphate and the Army. This ""Stolen Victory"",  combined with peasant unrest and the danger of a Bolshevik-inspired uprising, results in a takeover by a fringe faction of the Young Turks, who install a popular former general named Mustafa Kemal as Grand Vizier in 1922 and finally deposed the Sultan in 1924. The Kemalist government initiated an ethic cleansing of Greek and Armenian elements (among others) in its territory, as well as a crash industrialization program and an extensive military and naval expansion and modernization project. Much of its propaganda was based on recovering its ""unredeemed"" territories in Egypt, the construction of a pan-Islamic state ranging from North Africa (nominally ruled by a Franco-German consortium but actually German in practice, with large and notoriously brutal German garrisons) to the former Russian Central Asia, now ruled by nominally independent but German dominated governments. An alternative model for expansion was pan-Turanianism, which demanded the annexation of territories into Mongolia and (in its most extreme cases) even Japan.  Continual friction with Germany and Austro-Hungary naturally led to an alliance with Lavalist France and the creation of the Paris-Istanbul Axis. On the economic front, the French provided technical expertise and capital (often channeled through USA, Switzerland or Japan, to avoid the prying eyes of German inspectors), with the Ottomans providing much-needed raw materials and even manpower for France's factories. With the Treaty of London (1932), Britain and Japan joined the Axis in the Containment Pact, hoping to neutralize the German threat to British and Japanese interests in India, China and Korea.  The French invasion of Burgundy ( September 1936) precipitated the Second Great War, arraying the Paris-Istanbul Axis against the German Empire and its satellites, notably the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Soviet Union. The fall of Vienna (May 1937) incited the British and Japanese to join their Pact allies in the war, lest they be locked out of colonial expansion, with the British hoping to gain the Greater German Congo and the Japanese seeking large territorial concessions in the Russian Far East in what they hoped would be a quick war; however, Germany and the Soviets proved far more resilient than expected. American aid to their Great War allies and an aggressive anti-submarine campaign in the North Atlantic forced Wilhelm III to declare war on the USA (March 1941); ironically, Chamberlain's Britain surrendered just 3 weeks later under the pressure of starvation and a Bolshevik-inspired general strike. With the collapse of Britain, the Ottomans were able to re-occupy Egypt and take over Persia, much to their allies' chagrin The war dragged on until August 1944, when the Americans famously dropped atomic bombs on Hamburg and Petrograd. By this time the Ottomans had effectively occupied North Africa with the help of local guerrillas. Whether the French Colonial ""Partisan"" movement helped or hindered either side more remains a matter of debate to this day.  The continuing three-way ""Cold War"" between the much enlarged France and its satellites, the USA and its allies and the Ottoman Republic dominates world politics to this date."

HistoryWhatIf,35g6v4,LaoBa,2,Tue May 19 10:09:44 2015 UTC,"Discovery Channel released an interesting documentary called Falklands - How Close to Defeat where it talks about several tactical advantages that the Argentines could have been used in their favor; I will give my best try to create an alternate timeline:  In early 1982, Argentina was under the rule of a military junta and was facing the so called Dirty War and a crippled economy. There had already been several protests demanding democracy, answers for human right abuses and forced disappearances. Argentina was planning an invasion on the islands during this time, but it was originally scheduled for late on that year. General Leopoldo Galtieri needed to boost his popularity and during the South Georgia crisis the Argentines were misinformed that a nuclear submarine was dispatched from Gibraltar, two things that accelerated the attack. Assuming the invasion went as originally planned, Argentina would have more time to prepare and the British would have to face a colder weather.  The junta possibly wouldn't have problems repressing the growing unrest or even a hypothetical uprising under the military dictatorship, so they could hold out for a couple of months more until the Argentine forces were ready. During this time Argentina would have equipped its army better and particularly received more Exocet air-to-surface missiles, while the United Kingdom probably would have continued its budget cuts in the Royal Navy, attempting to solve its two-year-long recession and staggering unemployment. It could have even gone to the point to dismissing the main warships involved in the conflict: Aircraft carriers HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible, and amphibious LPDs HMS Invincible and HMS Intrepid. Would Argentina had been lucky enough, the Royal Navy would be limited to coastal defense forces; a Task Force possibly couldn't have been formed and the war wouldn't have started at all.  On the other hand, should the UK still had the force to counterattack, the Task Force would probably have lasted two or three weeks to reach the Falklands, just like in our OTL, 8000 miles away from home, although possibly they could have undergone more problems due to the hostile weather. Arguably, Argentina could have decided to deploy more experienced troops, that they had previously stationed in the frontier with Chile due to another territorial dispute known as the Beagle conflict, in the islands instead of poorly trained and young conscripts, and deploying the latter in the mainland to defend the border. Adding the fact that in OTL the Argentines built up trenches and machine gun nests, all this would allow Argentina to defend better the islands.  The other advantage Argentina could have had was building a longer runway Port Stanley. That way the Argentinean airplanes wouldn't need to take off from the South American mainland and could stay airborne for much longer, but the Brits were wary of this fact and avoided that it could be established at all costs. Starting a new base of operations in so short time after the invasion would have been very hard, if not impossible. Nevertheless, even if the Argentines didn't as much flight time as the British they still outnumbered their air force by almost twice. Conducting a mass and coordinated air attack on the Task Force when the carriers were in range would have dealt a great blow to the British.  Furthermore, the Argentinean battleship ARA General Belgrano had a large fire range, even though it was from the WWII era and a survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack. If it wasn't sunk by the HMS Conqueror nuclear submarine, Argentina wouldn't have decided to call its navy back, wouldn't have sustained half of their casualties in the conflict and would have had the chance to further harass the Task Force. By this time the British HMS Sheffield and SS Atlantic Conveyor could have been sunk. After the loss of the latter the Britons lacked the helicopters needed to transport artillery, making it harder to move in the battlefield. Argentine's strikes at this time arguably could have been enough to stop the British invasion. However, if this wasn't the case the next scenario would have been the San Carlos Bay.  The Argentines only had 37 naval mines during the whole war, and they didn't know where the British would disembark exactly. If they decided to place all the mines in the bay, casualties during the already vulnerable amphibious attack would have been even heavier. Had the British lost more troop and supply ships, establishing a beachhead possibly couldn't have happened. Again, if in a twist of luck the British still had enough soldiers to carry on…  The British underestimated the garrison in Goose Green and were already running low on supplies and ammo. British infantry was made of professional soldiers unlike their enemy's troops, undisciplined conscripts. However, we previously considered that the troops sent to the Falklands were better trained and equipped; it was only a matter of time until the British were forced to halt the assault, so the Argentines had to hold Goose Green as long as possible.  This is when speculation begins, since so far it has only been talked how Argentina could have possibly won the war, not its effects. The UK would find it very hard to extend the conflict further, so eventually they would have to declare a ceasefire and surrender. The remaining Task Force would retreat. After the victory in the Falklands, Argentina's junta could have decided to also to recapture the Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands from Chile, bringing a violent end to the Beagle conflict.  Both Galtieri and Thatcher had their offices at stake. Margaret immediately lost the support she gained during the war. She was criticized for neglecting the islands' defenses, blamed for the defeat and lost the elections the June 9th of 1983 to the Labour leader, Michael Foot. Meanwhile, the Argentines rejoiced after hearing of the victory in the Malvinas Islands; the military junta suspended the elections indefinitely, allowing Galtieri to stay in power for several years more. He could have been ousted by a coup later, have resigned, died from a heart attack in 2003 while being in office or simply had to accept democracy after a referendum. Who knows?  Argentina reassured their sovereignty claim in the Malvinas Islands and the Southern Thule. Argentines probably would have started moving to the islands; in the following decades the Argentine descendants would have increased dramatically, and most of the kepler population now supports Argentina's claim. The Commonwealth and the European Economic Community imposed sanctions to Argentina just like in OTL, but now the country could focus on improving the economy, and eventually they had to take down the sanctions to one of their most important meat trade partner.  Noticeably, it took many years after the war until anyone answered for the abuses committed during the Dirty War. National Commission for Forced Disappearances (CONADEP) was established much later than in our OTL, when a democratic government finally was established in Argentina. All the evidence needed to carry the Juicio a las Juntas (Trial of the Juntas), including testimony from hundreds of witnesses about victims of the regime, documentations of hundreds of secret prisons and detention centers, and the identification of leaders of torture and death squads, allowed to prove the crimes that most members of the junta were responsible of two years later after the commission was formed. Most of the top officers were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, but again, most of them died before they could start their sentence.  TL;DR: An invasion carried out later in the year by Argentina and the continous loss of British supplies forced the United Kingdom to surrender. Margaret Thatcher lost the 1983 elections, the military junta in Argentina suspended the elections indefinitely and Leopoldo Galtieri kept power for many years more. Argentina could also have invaded islands disputed with Chile. The leaders of the military junta would have answered for the crimes committed during the Dirty War much later."

But to attempt to answer the question: if the UK tried to hang on to the remainder, it would be necessary to ship in things like desalination plants which would be enormously expensive to run for that population. If I ran the mainland govt, I'd probably leave the borders open to encourage flight into the British area, overloading the food and water supplies, plus accommodation, sewerage etc. This would be easier than using military means, and would avoid contravening international law. BTW, historically this was sometimes used as a siege tactic - encourage your enemy's population to get inside their castle or walled city to overload its resources and cause it to capitulate earlier."
HistoryWhatIf,35frd1,plincer,2,Sun May 10 02:30:45 2015 UTC,"Remember that the British had been ceded permanent sovereignty over Hong Kong Island but in 1997 their 99-year lease was expiring on the mainland portion of Hong Kong.  So if the British refused to vacate the mainland portion, China would have been within their rights to take it, by force if necessary.  As for the island: it didn't have sufficient fresh water to sustain itself (once the mainland portion was gone).    Assuming the Chinese take a Berlin Wall approach rather than invasion: they could have refused to supply water or conduct any trade with Hong Kong.  As for Hong Kong harbour itself: the Chinese would presumably had sovereignty over half of the water between the mainland and island.  At a minimum, it would have been an awkward transition.  As the deadline approached, would Hong Kong citizens streamed onto the island to avoid the Chinese?  Would that have made an already crowded rump Hong Kong too crowded to continue?  I think that the British considered these possibilities in 1984 and decided that the ""one country, two systems"" for 50 years (starting 1997) was going to be better for Hong Kong than the uncertainty of a rump Hong Kong island trying to hang on."

I'm not old enough to remember caring about it at the time, but Colin Powell had very high approval ratings in the aftermath of the first Iraq War.  He was a four star General, National Security advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.  And  Congress wanted to make him a five-star general; Pres. Clinton resisted the idea.  He would have made a better president.  As Secretary of State his opinion's were largely ignored and he was often left outside of or overruled on major policy decisions.  The republican party would likely be more moderate and the country more prosperous if he were president.  911 would have probably still happened, but he was far more equipped to deal with it than Bush, and I highly doubt we would have invaded Iraq.  We may have still gone to war, but it would not have been the nightmare of organization and misinformation that ensued.  I apologize if I'm being partisan, I did not intend to be.

Remember, the western and southern republicans hadn't gone anywhere.  Powell could have had the nomination handed to him, but he would have had serious problems assuming he had to face 9/11, as he was clearly fat more a neconservative that a regular conservative.  He would have had a hard time making an overwhelming response toward Afghanistan, which even Democrats supported under President Bush.  I have no doubt that he would not have gone into Iraq: this means that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, he'd still be a threat against the Kurds, and he'd still be a general threat to his neighbords, especially there is evidence that Hussein really did have chemical weapons.  Then, of course, there are the democrats, who would not have been able to stand being out of power.  They would have trashed Powell's credibility, called him every name in the book (Uncle Tom, traitor to his race, consorting with the enemy, etc), and they would have ruthlessly savaged Powell.  By 2004, Republicans would have view Powell as weak and incapable of protecting the nation, this in spite of his former role as General.  Having had no experience, he would not have built up the kind of relationships needed to raise money and keep party members happy.  Having immediately forsaken conservatives, and having no support among democrats, Powell would have been able to force renomination in 2004, but he would have certainly lost to a John Kerry/Howard Dean type.    So, in the end, Powell would have been much like George H. W. Bush, than the son he was Secretary of State under."

HistoryWhatIf,35eclr,saxonjf,2,Sun May 10 03:58:22 2015 UTC,"Powell didn't have much of a domestic record to speak of.  He had been a soldier, but as a General, it had been one of a more internationalist sense, as he had been National Security Advisor under Ronald Reagan, and CJCS under Bush 41.  NSA has little to do with direct military command, and CJCS was certainly more to do with organization and policy than it does actual direct command.  Not running for any office, he never had to lay out any particular policy, nor did he have to appeal to the voters, the party, or to fundaraisers, but the impression I got from reading news reports is that he was on the left end of the Republican Party.  Frankly, not having any political experience, I can't imagine him pressing legislation much at all, so I don't see a No Child Left Behind.  The party seems to be in agreement that more conservative justices is preferable to pantywaists.  Bush 41 nominated Clarence Thomas, but also David Souter, who is generally derided as a lightweight at very best.  W. Bush followed a traditional path of nominating safe Conservative justices, so Powell would probably have ticked off Republicans in Congress if he had nominated lightweights.  He might not have nominated Alberto Gonzalez, but I think he would have played it safe, otherwise.  As for New Orleans, that was more of a media disaster than anything else.  I really don't think that Powell really could have done much more than W. Bush did.  It had been incumbent on the state of Louisiana and the City to get people out, and there essentially did nothing.  Images of hundreds of flooded school buses tell the tale that they could have been transporting thousands of people to safety of the inland areas, but didn't.  State responsibilities like the highways and city concerns like the Convention Center and The Metrodome were damaged by the storm. Powell would have called out the national guard and requested funds from Congress just as W. Bush did.  Perhaps the media would have been slightly less vicious, but they would not have let the opportunity to talk up the ""Evil Republican"" talking points, this in spite of the fact that:   Politicians, activists, pundits, and journalists also directed criticism at the local and state governments headed by Mayor Nagin of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor Blanco. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who could not find any way out of the city.   -- Wikipedia"

But I think you underestimate the effect a president can have on the direction a party goes in.  He may have had to struggle for Republican votes in the Congress but I don't believe he would have shied from gathering Democratic votes.  More than anything I believe he was/is a centrist.  And barring everything else I've said till now he certainly would not have fanned the flames of racial and socioeconomic tension that run through our society (as the last several Republican president's did, and in the process radicalized the political spectrum).  Also, I think you underestimate the political nature of a general at that level.  He was more than prepared to be President (far more than W. Bush, Reagan, or Carter) and had been for quite a while.  He may not have had defined positions on many civil issues but I'm not sure that would have hurt him.  I doubt that there are many people who haven't had the benefit of occupying a high position in the military or intelligence community or Congress that actually have a good understanding of how the power structures in our government operate to effect meaningful policy.

HistoryWhatIf,35er0r,JackONeill_,5,Sat May 9 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"Well the question is, what did they want to achieve?  Japan just wanted a colonial empire, but Hitler wanted what? To conquer the entire world?  I don't think such a goal could ever have been achieved by anyone.  If Hitler had been sane enough to have realistic goals, he probably wouldn't have gone to war in the first place.  But if Hitler had kept his focus on Moscow, and had sent his troops winter equipment, and hadn't had an unrealistic timeline, he probably could have stopped his campaign at Russia and held a pretty powerful position.  Yes, the lack of oil probably would have done real damage eventually (as it was Japan's ultimate downfall as well).  But trying to secure oil while fighting a 2 front offensive war is different than trying to secure oil with a standing army that has nothing to do but defend reasonable borders.  It also goes without saying that if he hadn't had the bone-headed policy of treating locals in conquered Russian territory like subhuman trash, he would have had an easier time building a new empire.  But again, if he was sane enough to lay the foundation for an actual German empire, he wouldn't have gone to war in the first place.  If he hadn't attacked France and the rest of Western and Northern Europe, Chamberlain's government probably wouldn't have collapsed.  Churchill and the US may not have gotten involved, and if Germany had sued for peace after basically taking Eastern Europe and say Western Russia, they might have gotten it.  The critical factor would have been capturing enough resources to be economically self-sufficient, so they could ride out economic sanctions.  It probably would have led to another cold-war situation.  But this scenario presents a big problem.  If you have just captured a vast new empire, but it is entirely to the east of your capitol and to the west are nothing but powerful enemies... well, it doesn't look like a very safe position.  Germany needed a buffer to the west.  Otherwise the western countries could just bide their time, mass forces, and capture Berlin within, perhaps, 5 weeks of declaring war, cutting the head off the giant.  Building a buffer is critical, just look at Russia's actions during the cold war- everything was aimed a building a buffer because a buffer had served them so well during WWII (and against Napoleon).  So really, Germany had no choice but to invade western and nothern europe and pull Britain and the US into an actual shooting war.  If you look at it like that, Germany could not have won under any conceivable circumstance.  Even if they had managed to nuke London somehow, that wouldn't have deterred the US.  So we arrive at the crux of the matter.  The fundamental problem is the exact same as it has always been.  Germany is in a shitty location.  It's why it didn't even exist as a country or kingdom until the end of the 1800s.  Spain, France, England, and Italy are nothing BUT natural borders.  Germany?  Nothing.  They hardly deserve to exist, let alone rule Europe."

Instead of what happened in OTL, the Luftwaffe carries out a bombing campaign geared towards wiping out British air power and securing both naval and air supremacy within the English Channel.   This is exactly what they attempted.  It wasn't a matter of strategy, the Luftwaffe was just outclassed.  From Wikipedia:   The German objective was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command. From July 1940, coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres, such as Portsmouth, were the main targets; one month later, the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the battle progressed, the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure. Eventually the Luftwaffe resorted to attacking areas of political significance and using terror bombing strategy.   The shift to attacking London itself was a last resort, after the battle had in fact already been lost:   The only alternative to the goal of air superiority was a terror bombing campaign aimed at the civilian population, but this was considered a last resort and it was (at this stage of the battle) expressly forbidden by Hitler."

Hitler went nuts and demanded retaliatory bombing against British civilian targets, thus giving the RAF the time they needed to regroup.   If the Luftwaffe had continued to bomb those airfields, thus knocking the RAF out as a player, could the Germans invade? All signs point to that not being very likely. There wasn't enough shipping to land troops, tanks, and all the supplies they would need. Not to mention the weather wouldn't cooperate.   However, and this is admittedly stretching things a bit, with the RAF unable to seriously hamper Luftwaffe bombing runs anymore, full scale attacks on civilian targets commence, much like what the US would later do against Germany. Would this be enough to establish a truce or cease fire at some point? With the RAF out of action, the threat of invasion hanging over their heads, and the Middle East on the verge of being lost, there is a slight chance."

The only thing that could have saved Germany was if they had managed to weaponize their nuclear program and took control of GB.  Once Germany had GB it could consolidate its control of the Western coast of Europe and focus on its other fronts.  Japan could have survived through clever statesmanship, which wasn't really their style at the time, if it never attacked the US.  If Japan had suddenly decided that it had acquired enough territory and devoted all of its resources to consolidating control of its new territory, the U.S likely would have left them alone, mostly.  The interesting thing to me is the issue of the Philippines.  I don't think that Japan could have been happy about the US having military bases so near to its mainland, nor do I think that the US was willing to allow Japan to acquire its territories.  Whether or not a peaceable solution could have been worked out, I'm not sure.  Basically If the Axis had played a waiting game rather than focusing purely on aggression, it could have survived (I'm not sure about prevailed).  All the major powers where pursuing nuclear research.  If the Axis lasted long enough to have functional bombs, It might have survived indefinitely.

All these elements made the British government decide that they could not win a war in India.  If they did they would loose quite quickly.

Back to your OP, though--if Russia would have never left WWI, then Germany might have lost WWI slightly sooner; however, even more importantly than that, Russia would have actually received some war spoils after WWI (reparations from Germany, parts of the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary, and maybe Germany as well) due to it being one of the Entente/Allied members and staying in WWI until the end of this war. In this scenario, Poland might still become independent after the end of WWI (I am unsure that Nicholas II would insist on reacquiring Poland after Germany will withdraw from there), but chances are that Russia keeps all of the Baltic states, Ukraine, and all of the Caucasian states after WWI in this scenario.  Also, this could result in interesting butterflies later on; for instance, if Hitler and the Nazis still eventually come to power in Germany, would a reforming* Tsarist Russia be willing to strike a Molotov-Ribbentrop-style deal with Hitler in order to give Hitler a free hand in the West? Thoughts on this?  *This might be the only way for Tsarist Russia to survive until the late 1930s and beyond even if Russia ends up on the winning side of WWI in this scenario."

Berlin had already fallen to the Soviets, the Wehrmatch had collapsed as an effective fighting force. By this time, troops were fleeing the Soviets in the East, not to regroup and counterattack or even get behind defensive positions, but get to the Western lines and surrender to them instead of the Soviets.   Had Dönitz's offer of surrender been accepted by Eisenhower (which is extremely unlikely, the Allies had previously agreed that there would be no separate peace with Nazi Germany) and then ordered all troops on the Western Front to move to the Eastern Front to attempt to hold off the Soviets, the majority of the army would have deserted, or attempted to surrender to the Western Allies. The few that did not do either of the above would be prompted crushed by the Red Army. They stand no chance - they are outnumbered, their logistical chain is next to non-existent, their enemy has air superiority (if not supremacy by this point) and the best fate they can hope for is to die in battle - if they are captured, they will almost certainly be sent to a slave labour camp somewhere in Siberia.    The post-war world contains far more hostility between the Soviets and the West. During the Yalta Conference, the Allies had agreed that there would be no separate peace with Nazi Germany. Since Eisenhower's acceptance of this deal would be considered reneging on that agreement, the USSR would rightfully view this as a betrayal and hence themselves renege on any agreements made at Yalta. There would be no ""West Berlin"" in this timeline and the Soviets would simply seize every piece of German territory that their troops stood on. The USSR was persuaded to be not so extreme in their seizure of repatriations from Germany by the WAllies as well. In this TL, this would not the case - East Germany would essentially suffer Holodomor 2.0.

HistoryWhatIf,35ceo6,griffers,4,Fri May 8 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"This got me thinking, and my first thought was that it wouldn't have to necessarily focus on the east coast. For example, targets could be chosen in populated areas throughout the in the Bay, Valley, or Pacific Northwest.  I then realized that since the terrorists established a location for themselves in the United States prior to 9/11 that it wouldn't really matter, and that higher valued and more probative targets like the ones on the east coast could still be chosen.  Another theory might be that they target aircraft toward central business/tourism districts in general, foregoing the east coast targets.  A few things are important to note however:    the west coast of the USA is less dense, and in some areas there are vast stretches of complete wilderness. This corresponds with demographic trends east and west of the Mississippi. What this means is that Air Force Defense, (especially NORAD, which is also in the region) would have operations much closer to their bases.  If we assume the same president (George W. Bush), date and location during the attack, and a variety of west coast targets, then it becomes easier for the president to fly back to the White House OR to a command and control center closer (state wise, albeit still at a safe distance) to where the action is taking place. Perhaps the most interesting consideration might be flights. Because the number of flights between west coast cities and the Pacific Region targets is way higher than comparable flights from east coast cities to the Middle East, these terrorists could choose from a number of domestic or international airlines making the pacific passage.  If the desire is to increase destruction, the boeing 747, 777, or A340 are much larger than the 757 and 767 aircraft used, and could inflict more damage. It is known that the terrorists chose transcontinental flights because at the time such flights were largely flown by the mid-sized fixed wing aircraft with balanced centers of gravity [these differ from the design styling of the MD80, DC10/MD-11 and largely defunct Boeing 727 which feature a tail engine and drag-racer landing gear configuration with a rear-facing center of gravity]. With the probability of the second type - MD80/727 being much smaller, or massive and international DC10/MD-11 only certain sized [i.e. transcontinental] flights met the likely probability of a large enough aircraft, with a large enough wingspan to inflict a considerate amount of damage.   In all, I think that west coast targets would be likely given the range and scale of aircraft. The Government may have been able to better respond to or anticipate the crisis (and the window would have been narrowed), and given the start times, Washington would be wide awake at the dawn of the working day across the west coast.  Arguability the population distribution and access to high value targets make the metrics of a west coast attack slightly more difficult. Proximity of military and airforce units, the east coast time advantage, and position of the president of the United States all make the success (keep in mind that east coast attacks had a 75% target rate) The midwest is less likely to have a considerable financial impact, but the effects of an attack on the heartland would have easily swayed the hearts and minds across the country. I for one feel as though our thoughts about United 93 and Shanksville occur on an arguably separate register from the attacks in New York City and the Pentagon.   On that note, a much smaller, but equally devistating attack could also take place within the State of Hawaii. Again, proximity to military readiness and a response time advantage favor the U.S., though potentially larger aircraft with better range and more passengers favor the terrorists."

More seriously while both were Leninists, Trotsky's thought was also more influenced by Orthodox Marxism in certain areas. Whether that was a good or bad thing would really remain to be seen. Trotsky first and foremost was a commander, an army man. He would be all for the martial spreading of Soviet-style Marxism abroad, directly intervening in those places which had just come out of revolutions and providing funds to those parties which the USSR could not have gotten to.   On the home front we would still see the consolidation of power within the legislature and away from the local Soviets that occured under Stalin and the collectivisation would happen earlier (he advocated for it long before Stalin implemented it, funnily enough the collectivisation scheme was one of the reasons Trotsky and the Left/United-Opposition were purged). The open rebellion of the kulaks and forced starvation they wrought on the peasantry and proletariat in Russia would be dealt with largely similarly tho I'm convinced that Trotsky would be more decisive in sending the army in and wiping out the kulaks swiftly.   Internationally the capitalist west would be more on edge than under Stalin for a longer time, but I think that with numerous failed revolutions abroad (if Soviet manpower is not enough to tip the material balance) that we'd settle in to the same type of cold war as OT, tho with the capitalists a bit more fearful of their lives because of Trotsky's willingness to send the Soviet army to aid workers' rebellions compared to Stalin who only nominally sent advisers and material aid."

There is a strong argument in favour of saying that there were others who could have sparked the change.  In a relatively short time, many others followed Luther's course and set up their own breakaway Christian churches.  This is an indication that the anger over the Church was widespread even though in 1517 many were not openly expressing their dissatisfaction.    The Catholic Church undertook their counter-reformation (scaling back many of the worst abuses) in response to threat that they might lose ever more of their adherents.  It seems unlikely that without the threat from the Protestants, the Catholic Church would have taken the drastic action to clean up their affairs.    So if it wasn't Luther, it would have been another figure that would have sparked something similar.  Let's say sometime in the 1500s."

Initially they shared nearly identical views but as years passed Karlstadt and Luther argued about how they should go about spreading Protestantism - Luther wanted it to be gradual to keep it less radicalized while Karlstadt wanted a swift reformation no matter what. People like Jean Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli were a little more 'out there' with their ideas and came slightly after Luther and Karlstadt. Karlstadt and Luther (mainly Luther) had more orthodox Lutheran ideas as opposed to more Reformed Protestants like Calvin. Calvin and Zwingli would still appear in the places they did at about the same times they did, it would just be Karlstadt at the fore instead of Luther.  So to answer the question: If Luther died unexpectedly in 1517, the Protestant Reformation still happens at the same general time it did historically (U/plincer's answer is a very good explanation of why it would still, inevitably happen).  Karlstadt would have taken his place no doubt in my mind.

With a new naval base, Lend Lease supplies can start arriving, as Soviet bombers and fighters assure control of the area. Those same bombers, with some modifications, can begin bombing the mainland. Also, Stalin can use the Chinese Communist Party as proxy fighters and supply them with weaponry, making it even more of a headache for the Japanese.

HistoryWhatIf,359001,3l33tvariance,3,Fri May 8 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand that your prompt asks ""what if Stalin had moved forces to Siberia to forestall a possible Japanese invasion,"" but I strongly believe that that's impossible, even in the realm of alt history. The Japanese would need to withdraw the bulk of their Pacific Army to make the threat credible, and start a deception campaign on the level of (Operation Bodyguard)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bodyguard], which is highly unlikely.  However, I'll argue that Japan could invade the USSR successfully, as long as it gave up invading China and the Pacific.  June 1940. Japan is slowly moving on with the meat grinder of China, while Hitler has just wrapped up France and looks at his Ukrainian lebensraum. The US still clings to isolationism, though the public, influenced by atrocities in democratic China, pushes for sanctions against Japan. All OTL.  Hearing word from Berlin of Hitler's next target, the Japanese prepare to assist, looking at juicy Siberian coal and oil. Withdrawing the army from China to Manchuria, Japan consolidates its damaged divisions and prepares to strike. US opposition to Japanese expansion disappears overnight, as well as the threat of sanctions or even war, ensuring the supply of needed oil. A few months after Operation Barbarossa kicks off in 1941, elements of the battle-hardened Kwantung Army cross the border. Air strikes neutralize Soviet airfields, allowing the Japanese Air Force to have a field day with Soviet static defenses and tanks. The Pacific Fleet delivers an army further north, past Vladivostok. Encountering no resistance, these troops catch Soviet defenses in a pincer, much like Hong Kong OTL. Relief and escape efforts are continually bungled; the Japanese front was a dumping ground for old and incapable leadership, and Stalin's top generals are all busy fighting the Germans. Stalin views the Nazis as a bigger threat, and does not spare much manpower or resources to hold the Japanese, believing them inferior to Soviet troops especially after Nomonhan. Vladivostok is unwilling to surrender (those lovely Soviet commissars), and after a bloody siege falls to the Japanese in early 1942, a few months after the beginning of hostilities.  The dregs of the remaining Eastern Army swept aside, the Japanese dive off into the heart of the USSR, disrupting supplies and conscripts headed to Leningrad. Stalin realizes too late the extent of the Japanese push, redirecting forces to halt the Japanese at Lake Baikal. The Nazis are able to blitz further, and take Moscow in late 1942. Russian resistance crumbles, and the country is split between both Axis powers.  England and its colonies sign a peace treaty soon after as they are the only countries that can still technically oppose the Axis, ending WWII. The US is still relaxing in isolationism, and buoyed by its profits made from Japan during its invasion of the USSR; the US population doesn't care for the Soviets and views the European War with only mild interest.  In OTL, I would argue that Nomonhan failed to poor logistics and supply, as well as inadequate air cover, both because it wasn't a sanctioned attack by Japanese high command and could not receive full support. Fearful of escalation, the Japanese HQ, though winning engagements against airfields, decided to stop attacking them. If these attacks had continued, and air dominance established, the Japanese probably would be able to neutralize Soviet defenses with greater ease."
HistoryWhatIf,359001,lup0s,1 point,Fri May 8 08:15:29 2015 UTC,"I dont think this scenario works out that well. If Japan gives up both China and the Pacific, where would they have the resources to fuel their armies. Japan's war machine necessitated that it seize the resources in the Pacific.   The battles on the frontier showed various strategic and tactical failures that were not corrected by the Japanese. Japan did not emphasize the combined warfare tactics that would dominate during WWII and they were facing one of the masters of such warfare, Zhukov. Even assuming that Japan was able to even the air disparity during battles, they would not have been able to beat the soviet's superior armor and ground level tactics.   Furthermore, OP didnt set a timescale on this conflict but depending on when Japan engages in this invasion, it may render it moot. Stalin only transferred the Far East troops around late 1941 to counter Operation Typhoon. If Japan invades before that, they'd still probably lose. If they invade after, they may have a chance to deal some damage to the Soviet Union, but the troops have already been transferred for the Battle of Moscow. As another posted noted, they could capture Vladivostok but thats about it, everything else is just tundra for the most part."
HistoryWhatIf,359001,3l33tvariance,2,Fri May 8 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"In response to that first point, I'm arguing that the US would continue to supply oil and resources to Japan. I believe the primary reason for the oil embargo was due to negative US opinion of the mistreatment of Chinese citizens by occupation troops - both countries were democratic, with strong press coverage of attacks against the civilian population. Withdrawing troops from China would ensure the continued supply of US oil even when the Japanese invades the USSR - let's be honest, there's no press coverage nor many civilians in Siberia, not to mention it's the USSR. The US didn't want to fight a war, and was just content to sell things to the highest bidder.  Zhukov would have been transferred to the West in my timeline - Stalin, not expecting a Japanese attack, would probably transfer incompetent generals to the East, à la banishment to Siberia. I'm also assuming Japan to have won air superiority, not just achieving parity; this would give a heavy tactical advantage as troops could be recce'd from the air and pinned down. As mentioned earlier, a primary reason why the Japanese didn't win air superiority in Nomonhan was due to the orders of Army HQ to not attack airfields. The commitment of the Pacific Fleet's Air Arm would also tip the scales in the Japanese favor as well.  Yeah, the timeline is very strict, but I'm assuming Vladivostok to be captured in late 1941/early 1942, following withdrawal of forces. The other posters all assumed continued Japanese expansion into the Pacific, but with these troops all recalled to Manchuria there would be impetus to continue into Siberian oil and resources as with the Northern Expansion Doctrine - they couldn't fight anything else, lest they bring in US retaliation and sanctions. Nazi Germany would also require some help to conquer Russia, and assisting their ally would also give benefits - technology and Caucasus oil spring to mind, not to mention a land border.  This timeline does require a Japanese blitz to harass Soviet supply lines before Germany takes too much of a beating - though I believe definitely achievable."

Past the 1900s (honestly, past the early-mid 1800s in the West and mid to late-mid 1800s in East), the world had entered the era of nationalism, with feudalism left behind. The Japanese Emperor revered because he was an embodiment of the nation-state, not the other way around. For the Emperor of Japan to declare himself Emperor of China would be seen as a betrayal. Even if the Second-Sino Japanese War resulted in a successful conquest of China, it would have been ruled as a colony.   The best known TL that results in a modern-day Dynastic China is Hendryk's Superpower Empire, in which another dynasty rules over China after the Qing, but in my opinion, that requires several incredible strokes of luck for China. It is very well researched though, I recommend both you and OP give it a read.   Ultimately, I'd suggest that the political climate in the years after the Qing were overthrown makes it so that it's easier to either have the Qing successfully modernise (which itself is a monumental task, given the plethora of problems it faced) or successful other-throw of the Qing in the 18th century (ie.

The point of D-Day and the entire second front was to prevent Russia from steamrolling the entire continent. Linking up with Russian forces was not an option for the allies as it would effectively subvert what they were trying to accomplish by getting involved in a land war in the first place. If the allies had done nothing more than blockade Germany from the water, or hell, if they had done nothing at all, Russia still would have taken Germany down.  The purpose of D-Day and the western front in general was to get to Berlin at the same time as Russia, if not before. Coming in from the north would have made that impossible.   As to your question though, if the allies had linked up with Russia through Norway then there would have been no real reason for Russian forces to stop at Berlin, they would have pushed on into Austria, France (still effectively under German control) and probably south into Italy as well. The Soviet Union would have been much larger than we knew it and the Cold War would have taken a very different tone. I imagine there would have been more open hostility between the USSR and Britain, and the US by association, than there was because of the tension in Germany. Moscow is a lot closer to Berlin than it is to Paris, and flying a nuke to Moscow becomes that much harder when the USSR is that much bigger, giving the Russians a much bigger sense of security in their safety."
HistoryWhatIf,355xms,holyplankton,6,Thu May 7 13:00:51 2015 UTC,"I think you're downplaying the importance of this invasion. Yes Germany, in retrospect, was defeated but there was still a lot of fight left; over a year for that matter with a two front invasion. That is not nothing. Germany had still the most industrious parts of her empire (Northeast France/the Ruhr and the rest of West Germany) and just about the entirety of Poland and the Balkans under direct or indirect control and were protruding into Russia proper quite a bit.   Yes Russia fought the majority of the German army but there was not a negligible amount of forces in the West. By the time they launched Operation Bagration in '44 the Americans/British were beginning Operation Cobra and both were fighting equally sized German opponents. Yes that's right (not to you, but to the reader as I'm sure you know this :P) the Americans in Operation Cobra were fighting a force just as big as the Russians in Poland during Bagration. Cobra and Bagration are both, simultaneously, what broke the back of the German resistance.   Without Normandy and by extension Cobra the war would have been very different. Germany would not have had favorable peace by any account but the fight would have been far more bloody. Germany would have, at least, an entire new army group of nearly 2 million men ready to go the East and fight. Germany's industry, the Ruhr et. al, would have been mostly untouched and their war machine would have continued to roar. Russia would have had to fight tooth and nail across the entirety of Germany and even into France.   I don't think it's unreasonable at all that if it was just straight up Germany vs Russia, no land intervention at all by the Western Allies, that Germany would not have been so conclusively defeated. Hitler would have been deposed, the Nazi party with him, and I think obviously Germany would have been on the bad side of the peace but I don't think the total annexation and partition treatment they got would have been possible without Western intervention.

The loss of equipment and soldiers that Barbarossa cost them spelled the end, but Russia still had to turn it around and bring it back to Berlin and probably beyond if the US and Britain hadn't gotten involved.

It took about 12 hours to cover the 60 miles between the muster point in Southampton and the beaches of Normandy, but Norway is 600 miles from Britain. That means they would need to spend days at sea. When the troops finally staggered out of their landing craft, wishing that they were dead thanks to days of sea sickness from crossing the notoriously rough North Sea, they would be met by the German Army. Of course the Germans would know that they were coming. They knew that D-Day was coming, but because the allies could cross in one night they did not know exactly when. To attack Norway they will. There would probably be U-boats and fast attack craft shadowing them for most of the way.   So after having half the force picked off on route the remaining troops stagger up the beaches straight into the machine guns of the Germany army, but let us assume that somehow they win a beachhead. Possibly, because they were so sea sick that they genuinely did not care whether they lived or died and were therefore capable of acts of suicidal bravery. What happens next? Well, they get pasted with by the Luftwaffe. The distance has not just left everybody with terminal sea sickness, it means that the amount of time that the aeroplanes from Britain get to stay above the landing site is minimal. The Luftwaffe however have airfield across Norway that they could use to send regular bombing raids.  So far the invasion force has had half the force picked off getting to the beachheads. They then found a large German force waiting for them, and got pasted by the Luftwaffe, but somehow they manage to continue. They land their equipment and head inland, but not that far. As the allies found out in during their first invasion of Norway at the start of the war they would find that Norway is a land of valleys and steep mountains restricting their ability to manoeuvre. Then their fuel runs out.   For D-Day giant pipelines were laid across the channel in order to provide fuel, but that was only 60 miles. This time they have to cross closer to 600 miles, which they simply are not going to be able to do. So they are down to slogging their way on foot from valley to valley down Norway, and then their second amphibious invasion in order to cross the sea to Denmark. Presumably they swam, because there is precisely zero chance that they could muster enough landing craft under the noses of the Luftwaffe without them being sent straight to the bottom of the Baltic.   So let us assume that you are an ordinary German conscript on the Danish coast and you see this army emerge from the water, what do you do? You run. Seriously. Just run as fast as you can. To have got this far these soldiers are simply cannot be human. You are not going to be able to stand against them, so run while you still have time.  The communist horde is coming from the east, and this undead horde is coming in from the north. What happens next? Well the Nazi ideology was obsessed with blood and land. For them soil was sacred and was not something to be given up. So they would order their men not to give an inch, presumably after changing the colour of their uniform trousers to a nice shade of brown.  The target for everybody would be Berlin. By attacking from the north the allies are going to be much closer than the Soviets and will be there first. Hitler will be there and will commit suicide rather than being torn apart by the column of hideous allied zombies soldiers marching upon him.

Their objectives are to secure Warning Stations and destroy fixed emplacements, all of which are achieved and Allied Forces quickly move in across the Nation.  Simultaneous in the South, Allied Forces land right outside Cophenhagen and Frederikshaven and quickly move, but are halted due to a lack of supplies trapping them within the volatile Jutland Peninsula.  The invasion catches German forces off guard but they are quick to respond by moving forces from the Netherlands and France who are able to inflict serious losses on the poorly supplied Allies. To the North, most major ports and cities fall to the allies in Norway and it's not long before Soviet divisions in upper Finland and Norway meet up with American and British troops in the South.  In Italy, a new offensive picks up speed but ultimately slows just as fast with the Italian Mountains offering excellent defensive positions  and seriously making Airpower and Armor use near impossible. Any expectations of a major link up is completely off the charts unless secondary invasions occur in Northern Italy or somewhere in the North Atlantic Coast.  Soviet Forces initiate Operation Bagration and perform just as historically as plane, reaching Poland by Fall whereas the Allies have failed to breakout from Scandinavia and Italy. The Yalta Conference occurs with the Allies asking that Western Europe fall under their influence, while the Soviets will take Eastern Europe. Stalin rejects accepts, even as he has other plans.  As the Soviets push West they encounter more resistance due to the presence of more divisions and units, but with orders given on speed and the bunching of Nazi Units closer to home, by April the Soviets are at the doors of Berlin. The Nazi Government breaks to Hamburg when Berlin falls and Hitler dies.  In May of 1945, the Soviets form a large pocket between Allied lines in Jutland and the German City of Hamburg. An entire Soviet Front is dedicated for this purpose, while other Soviet Fronts move quickly into France and Benelux.   In June of 1945, nearly a year after the Allied Landings in Scandinavia and Operation Bagration, Europe is liberated and the Nazis capitulate with the Liberation of Paris and final, quick assault on Hamburg. France and Germany become Communist Nations, with uprisings of Belgian and Dutch Resistance members able to secure their nations with aid from Allied commando units and supply drops from the UK.

No Alps would make most of Europe easily conquerable, setting up a set of conditions similar to China role in East Asia.  East Asia has, except for a glaring anomaly over the past century, been dominated by Chinese politics. There was a lot of wealth centrally located in one region and whoever controlled that wealth could dominate the rest of the region. It was also impossible for several nations to exist in China, as one ascendant power from a warring states period could easily go off to conquer the rest of the region. This is shown in Chinese history as China would consistently go through cycles of destruction and rebirth, so much so that China doesn't have a true creation myth.  What did this mean for the region? The wealth of nations were dependent on China and thus said civilizations were generally oriented tradewise with China in mind. There was no need for exploration as all wealth depended on China.  In contrast, Europe is a peninsula of peninsulas with easily defensible mountain ranges and seas. Europe only ever unified once under Rome, and even that wasn't as complete of a domination as China was in its prime. Eventually, Europe settled as a concert of various nation-states completing with each other, and thus rewarding national competition including being a trade and military power. No Alps means that a European Chinese equivalent could have formed with one nation-state dictating the region.  The discovery of the Americas happened before, but Europe in the 16th century had the political situation most primed to take action on it; a set of various powers constantly in conflict with one another and thus ready to do anything to get any sort of gain on an adversary. Colonization was a risk every nation was willing to take as it could bring in massive wealth and gain an edge on other nations.   Due to the depopulation of the Americas due to the Great Dying, different European nations sent its own people in a colonization effort to make use of these new lands and their wealth. Combined with the lingering impacts of the Black Death, labor costs rose in Europe generally and especially in the United Kingdom. Labor costs rose so much that industrialization was viable; it made sense to try to replace labor in Europe as European labor cost as much as five times as it cost in China. This triggered the positive feedback loop that was the Industrial Revolution, where investments in technology and labor savings begat more wealth which begat more investments in technology and labor savings.  Therefore, no Alps, no Industrial Revolution.  TL;DR: The Alps created different nation-states to compete against each other during the Age of Exploration. The Age of Exploration depopulated Europe due to colonization. The resulting depopulation caused by colonization brought about the Industrial Revolution."

No benefit from Earth's magnetosphere, the grit is extremely abrasive and would be a constant cleaning & maintenance problem, and they'd have to deal with 2 weeks of darkness every month, so solar power is right out.  Nuclear power and underground chambers would help, but for that you need big, heavy earth-moving (haha) equipment.  Depending on regular resupply would be problematic, which means no taking the easy route with food and environment recycling.  They'd have to be able to produce at least some of their own consumables, and they'd have to deal with their wastes rather than simply dumping it into the atmosphere to burn up like the ISS does.  I say this on /r/space threads all the time.  Our ability to do interesting things in space is fundamentally a function of how much stuff we can put in orbit, how easily, and how cheaply.  By that metric, our rockets are expensive, unreliable toys.  We absolutely need to get civilization into space, but it's never going to happen riding a pillar of chemical fire.  By this time the limitations of the Shuttle program were well known.  Such a base wouldn't even make it out of a pre-planning committee."

Depending if Russia dropped out of WW1 or not would be a key point. I doubt the Russians would join Germany under the Tsarist regime to invade Poland. The military may have kept it's key leaders due to there not being a purge. So I think the Russians would have been just as well off if Germany invaded. Of course, if the Russians were invaded and the exact same scenario happened where they reach Berlin. I doubt there would be any vassal states and probably a more peaceful world after the war, with less of an emphasis on a Cold War. Considering the Tsarist Regime would probably be very, very, weary of Communism."

Buffer states will be established in Eastern Europe all under German economic hegemony. Germans will start colonizing Poland and the Poles will be forced east. Germany had extensive plans for a post WWI victory. I think it was called the Septemberprogramm.   It also involves bringing Belgium closer to Germany economically or outright annexing it. France will be forced to pay reperations and be dependent economically on Germany.

HistoryWhatIf,3562bw,HobbitFoot,3,Thu May 7 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"What would WW1 have looked like without British intervention?  To begin with there would not be much difference. The British army was good, but it was tiny. With the other powers fielding million strong armies it was simply not big enough. So the Germans release their right hook against France on the Western Front, before getting bogged down into trench warfare. They would keep slugging at each other for the next couple of years, and this is where things change.  By 1916 the French Army had been pretty much bled dry and was on the edge of mutiny. This was why the British committed so much to the Somme offensive. The idea was not to win the war, they simply wanted to relieve some of the pressure on the French because otherwise they would have lost. Without this relief the French army could well have broken and refused to fight anymore, which would have forced the French to the negotiating table. The Germans are not going to offer easy terms, but they are not going to have a choice but to accept with their army no longer willing to fight.  The German position was not that much better than the French so they would have sat down to negotiate with them. They would not have been having to deal with the British blockade, but all that means is that both they and the French would have been buying as much stuff from British factories as they could in order to throw it at the western front. They will probably demand some French colonies, and maybe some land in France itself, plus huge reparations but they are still going to be flat broke and massively in debt to the British for all the stuff they bought in order to win the war.  If the French sue for peace in 1916 then the Russians would not be able to fight for much longer either. By the end of the war both the British and French were basically throwing stuff at Russia to try and keep it in the war. This time they would be having to buy it in exchange for hard currency, which they would be running out of. So the Russian also sue for peace in 1916, before the crop failures of 1917, which triggered the revolutions of that year. Would the revolutions be avoided then? Probably not. The loss of the 1905 war with Japan had also triggered a near revolution, and the losses they suffered in WW1 were far worse. The Tsar had not yet taken personal responsibility for the almighty fuck up, so there would be less hatred for him so he might have a chance of remaining as a constitutional monarch. However, it is also possible that the Social Revolutionary faction would be the most powerful, as it was after the revolution of February 1917. One thing is certain, there would be no Bolshevik revolution as all the Bolshevik leaders were still in Switzerland and the German government would have no reason to facilitate getting them to Russia.  Italy and Thailand only joined the war on the Entente side late, so they might sit out the entire war as neutrals.  Serbia is now on the losing side. Despite the defeats that they had inflicted on Austria-Hungary during the war they are not going to come out the other side as a sovereign state and would probably get divided up between Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria.  With the war ending in 1916 Austria-Hungary might actually survive for a few more years, rather than breaking up immediately. It could even gobble up some more territory. But everybody would know, this was simply delaying the inevitable. The new Emperor, Charles I, would have is hands full trying to keep it from breaking up.  Sultan Mehmed VI of the Ottoman Empire would be having similar problems in the east. The Ottoman Empire had been seen as on its last legs for years, with the other great powers constantly looking for bits of territory that they could grab. There is no doubt that they would still be looking for such acquisitions, and I would expect that Britain would have one eye on Mesopotamia. They already knew that the fuel that needed for their dreadnoughts was oil, and they did not have any. This is the reason they started the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1908. With Russia now out of the Great Game in that area they would definitely be trying to incite rebellions amongst the Sultans less loyal subjects in order to break them off and take into the British sphere of influence. They are going to have plenty of money in order to facilitate this.  The big winner of WW1 is now the British. Having spent 2 years selling stuff to the French and Germans as fast as their factories could produce they are going to be flush with money. They would not have shifted to fiat currency in order to pay for the war, and so would not suffer a horrible depression in the 1920s, which happened when they tried to shift back into the gold standard at the wrong rate. The empire would not be quite as big since they would not have grabbed German East Africa or any bits from the Ottoman Empire, yet, but they would still probably have used the chaos in France as an excuse to grab some bits of French North Africa and place it under its 'protection' in order to secure the trade routes through the Mediterranean.  Would it even have been a World War?  All of the combatants were global powers with colonies, but without Britain it probably would have been more limited to Europe and the Black Sea area. I would expect that the Germans would try to get the Ottoman Empire involved in order to open up a second front against the Russians. The Russians would also be pleading with their allies for more supplies, and a warm water port to ship it through. But would the French have tried to force their way through the Dardanelles without Winston Churchill telling them to? I doubt it, for the simple reason that taking the most powerful fleet to have ever set sail and sending it straight into a known minefield surrounded by forts sounds insane: because it is. So the fighting between the Russians and the Ottomans still happens, but the Gallipoli campaign does not.  There were a few naval engagements around the Americas, but nothing more. These battles between the Kaiserliche Marine and the Royal Navy are unlikely to happen without Royal Navy being involved since the French fleet was concentrated in the Mediterranean.  There were battles in Africa where General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck lead the British on a chase across the continent. The German government had actually hoped that the colonies would stay neutral since they did not want to risk losing the few they had. If the British are neutral then the British colonies would insulate German East Africa from direct contact with the French colonies so preventing any conflict between them. There could still be some gunboat actions on lake Tanganika, but it is unlikely to be much more than that.  Without British involvement it would be more difficult for their allies the Japanese to find a causus beli for attacking the German enclaves in China. However, Japan's involvement was more about their own resource problem than the alliances that they had. Without British involvement they would still try to get involved on one side or the other in order to expand their holdings in Korea and China."
HistoryWhatIf,3562bw,SaverTooth,3,Fri May 8 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would have still been a world war since France and Germany would have still fought each other over colonies.  If Britain remains neutral throughout all of World War I, then the Germans probably still fail to capture Paris in 1914 due to logistics and due to a failure in the German command-and-control system. However, I strongly suspect that Germany will capture Paris and knock France out of World War I sometime between 1916 and 1918 in this scenario after France becomes too exhausted (and is unable to replenish its trenches with British troops). Likewise, Germany still wins World War I in the east in either 1917 or in 1918 in this scenario.  After the end of World War I in this scenario, Germany might decide to resume its naval arms race with Britain and to use its large reparations from France and Russia to pay for this (as well as to pay for the maintenance of Germany's new post-World War I Eastern European empire, et cetera)."

Wage anti-war psy-ops against the French, point out they are losing tens of thousands of men for little to no territorial gains, while constantly offering generous armistice terms.

Digressing, but it is fairly debatable if even the whole world combined could defeat the present USA on its own soil. Say, for instance, the Second Amendment is never passed or large parts of the West Coast end up under Canadian dominion. The only way the post-1900s US can be invaded is with the consent of the government."
HistoryWhatIf,356lfr,lup0s,6,Sat May 9 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"Seeing another Imperial Japan question made me a bit excited, but this scenario wouldn't end well.  edit: yeah, I know the prompt says the Japanese would hold California, but I highly doubt they would manage to get a foothold considering that the main US naval bases are in Cali. Following the capture of Pearl Harbor, it's also reasonable that high command would station an army or two in California just in case, delaying the Japanese Army enough for the first trainload of conscripts to arrive.  The US never really did want to fight, but Roosevelt used the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor to great effect to rally the citizens to war. An attempted invasion of the U.S. would probably galvanize the country into a massive war effort to repel the invaders.  I'm going to assume 1942 as the year for invasion, that the Japanese managed to take Pearl Harbor shortly after the attack and used it as a staging ground.  Also assuming that the Japanese fleet managed to sail close enough to the shore to give covering fire, they would take disproportionate losses from coastal defense batteries and aircraft, probably losing a couple carriers and innumerable smaller ships. Nonetheless, without this help, quite many of the landing craft would not have made it.  The US would withdraw their manufacturing capabilities to the heartland, and refit their shipbuilding facilities to the East Coast. As a stopgap, the Japanese would attempt to destroy the Panama Canal to prevent reinforcements, loading a captured ship at Pearl Harbor with tons of explosives. They would be unable to spare many ships, and the attack would fail by submarine or coastal defense, blowing the fire ship up near-reminiscent of the Halifax Explosion.  Faced with a hostile civilian population the forces on the California coast would drag on into a bloody urban attrition, unable to gain a foothold. The US, though facing superior Japanese Zeroes, would also wear away at the trained aviators of the carrier fleet, and also win via production as well. As more manpower is spared to R&D, US proximity fuses become available earlier, blowing planes out of the sky without even a direct hit. Slowly losing air superiority, as well as losing the supply war (as Japan would be unable to supply troops effectively across the Pacific), the remnants of the US invasion fleet are forced to withdraw and refit, and the Japanese army would face one of its largest defeats as they surrender/fight to the death amidst the ruins of LA and SF.  The Japanese Empire will be unable to recover from its losses as the US war machine marches on, hell bent on vengeance with several newly-developed nukes in tow."

HistoryWhatIf,356lfr,Dixie_Survivor,1 point,Thu May 7 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"The main difference is the availability of supplies. The Chinese could not stalemate and hold off the Japanese war machine. Coming from the large land base of Manchuokuo, the Japanese could very easily ship traincars of ammo and soldiers into China, allowing fast movement and a blitz into central China. Air support also allowed bombers to level strongholds before the infantry reached them, and since China is so massive they could still be bypassed, leaving the work to the armor. Then they got bogged down by partisans attacking their supply train, but they still managed to hold quite a bit of the country.  In the US, Japan already faces great difficulty shipping stuff across the Pacific, and air coverage would not be guaranteed. Combine that with the tenacity and desperation of the US, as well as arms parity or even superiority, and the Japanese army would just be throwing itself against a brick wall. Fighting on a beachhead, they could not just bypass strongholds and fortifications, and owing to the size of SF and LA they could not easily push through, like the small towns in Normandy.  It wouldn't make sense to land elsewhere, and flank the cities, as had been done with Hong Kong or Port Arthur, as the ports at LA and SF would be vital strategic points that had to be held to ensure resupply of the troops, especially for a protracted campaign like a US invasion. In both flanking battles above, the Japanese crushed reinforcements and encircled to ensure surrender, which wouldn't work in the states - frankly, the US military presence would deny a large flanking move like that, not speaking of the manpower and air support required."
