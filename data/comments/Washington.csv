Washington,3e5ea8,theresamouseinmyhous,4,Wed Jul 22 02:20:16 2015 UTC,"I live in the area and I'm out there weekly and go backpacking out there regularly.    How likely is this to fill up on a Sunday - Wednesday?   If you are talking 7 lakes, grand or enchanted valley pretty good but remeber 50% of them showed up with figers crossed too, you just have to beat them.   What's ""24 hours in advance""? If I want to hike out for 4 days, can I only get permits for the first two?   If you show up Saturday you can get a permit to start Sunday, or you can just get there first thing sunday and hope they didn't book out saturday. After that you are usually (but not always) golden, you can plan the rest of your trip. The 24 hours is just about the start date.   Is there something that I'm missing that could reverse this fuck up?   You haven't fucked up yet, not once have I ever not been able to show up when the ranger station opens and get my itinerary or at least very close to it on the day I'm leaving. If a particular camp is booked you can usually figure out a good second option. Be there sitting on the door step when the ranger unlocks it and follow them around like a puppy. It's annoying and they will just want to get rid of you.   Any other suggestions for 4 day hikes I can offer up so my fiance doesn't kill me in my sleep?   Where is your first choice and what level of experience / fitness do you have? Are we talking 7 miles and 2,000 feet per day or 15 miles and 5,000 feet per day? If you tell me where you will be (to try to get your permits) and the intensity that you are looking for, I can probably give you several plan B's nearby, but then so can the ranger.  It's a pretty big area though so I'd be looking for plan Bs that start from the same trailhead or one close to it. You don't want to try to drive the opposite side of the peninsula at the last min."
Washington,3e5ea8,ndt,2,Wed Jul 22 03:54:41 2015 UTC,Thanks. We're  coming from a wedding in Olympia and can't leave til Sunday morning. We're planning 19 miles in about 3 and a half days. We're fit enough but it's also a vacation so I'm shooting for 6ish miles a day. It sounds like this isn't uncommon and it's good to know the rangers can help us out.
Washington,3e5ea8,MollyTamale,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:56:36 2015 UTC,So does it have to be one solid 4 day hike?  Why not a few/couple smaller ones?

We were coming out of the Lillian River Basin and couldn't even see the other side of the Elwha. We thought it was another bout of the BC fires, but it was the Queets raging and getting blown eastward.

Not a huge city (20k population), but everything you would need should be in town.   The San Juan Islands ferry dock is just outside of Anacortes, but living and commuting from the islands isn't recommended (unless you're able to telecommute most of the time).  Bellingham is about 30 minutes north on I-5. It's a pretty hip college town, so if you're in your 20's this would be a good choice.  If you're looking for small towns, La Conner isn't a bad choice, less than 10 minutes from Mt Vernon. Any of the towns along WA-20 out to Concrete wouldn't be bad either.   I wouldn't go any farther south than Marysville, just because your commute will be more frustrating than anything else."

I am assuming that the substance abuse program was set up due to the courts recommendations because of your DUI conviction. This means that the only communication between the program and the courts is if you or if you did not complete your mandatory classes. Whatever substance abuse treatment company you go through and their policy really has no weight in the actual court system where it matters.  I don't see the issue with you smoking MMJ as long as the substance abuse treatment center does not drug test you. Does the program do drug testing? Does the courts do mandatory drug testing? I would not think so because I am assuming this is your first offense? Like I mentioned before, this is something you should speak to your lawyer about."

If they say no, you're going to have to deal with that, or try to get a lawyer - which will be expensive and likely not help much. I assume that you at least have some part of your sentence based on completing this treatment program. If you violate the treatment facilities orders, assuming that this was in fact court-ordered, you're going to be in violation of a court order and in big trouble.

Washington,3djh35,TheBrownWelsh,5,Thu Jul 16 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"What do you like best about it, and if I may ask what general area do you live in? I grew up there (Bellingham/Blaine/Ferndale area), and I've noticed that it's a very underrated state; not many people even know about it or think about it, so I'm always interested in what ""outsiders"" think of it, especially people from outside the U.S.A.  Edit- Also, what's you're least favorite thing?"
Washington,3djh35,Stevenmont92,12,Thu Jul 16 21:31:34 2015 UTC,"I spent 10yrs living in the Olympia-Seattle area (mostly Oly) and moved down to Vancouver 2-3yrs ago, so I now get to enjoy Oregon just as much. I loved Wales, but there's just been so many great things about living in WA that I have zero desire to move back and I rarely visit. My brother wants to move here as soon as his kids are old enough and my best friend there finally admitted that he likes it here after visiting a dozen times, so I'm hopeful he moves here if his stint in Japan doesn't pan out for him.  The things I like best about WA state are, in no particular order:   Nature/Terrain; I still can't get over how freakin gorgeous it is here, and how the landscape & terrain allow residents to perform an array of fun/exciting activities all grouped so close together. I could go snowboarding and then surfing all within a few hours of each other if I wanted. Hiking, rock climbing, river fun, etc. There's just so much to do here that I'm grateful every week for never being bored. But the snowboarding/hiking/water sports is specifically a big factor; never got to do any of that stuff living in Wales and now they're a huge part of me. People; every place has their share of ne'er do wells and shitty folks, but for the most part I've encountered mostly great people in this state. Open minded, eclectic, sharing, enthusiastic, etc. I love meeting new people and gaining new friends who introduce me to all sorts of new things that I may not have discovered by myself. I also love that my group of friends is a comingling of different types; earthy/naturey ""hippy"" types and truck loving ""redneck"" types, all mixed together and living in harmony. It's great not having to deal with ""cliques"" and whatnot, because (most) people here seem to not care what you're like so long as you're not a dick. In general, I like how forward thinking this state is. My uneducated theory is that because WA was one of the last states to be founded in the US, it's slightly more ""modern"" in how it approaches many things, from technology to social issues. Not everything, of course, but moreso than I considered Wales to be. I grew up with a lot of racism directed at me so my memories of my homeland are a little marred by shit-tinted glasses, but the fact remains that when I lived in Wales I was picked on for my ethnicity whereas here people barely even acknowledge that I'm from another country. To them, I'm an American/Washingtonian (mostly; the accent sometimes causes some pretty cliche interactions). Surrounding areas; I've visited America a bunch as a kid (family spread all over the world) but having lived in WA for over a decade it's been a real treat to be able to visit states so different to WA. Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon (okay, not that different), California, etc. There's so much to do and see here that I forget how much there is outside the state. I've become a huge fan of roadtrips over the years, we even went on a 4 state drive for our honeymoon. In Wales, you can only drive so far before you've got to turn back around. And I've visited Canada more times than I can remember at this point. My wife; I met my wife here. She's the light of my life and my reason for getting up in the morning. Nuff said.   Now, things I like the least? I don't really think about the negatives, but probably the way we treat our homeless and mentally unstable in this state. I can't go into the specifics but this state really needs to reform it's standards and practices in dealing with people in those situations. In fact my only complaints about this state have to do with local and federal politics, and those are all topic-dependent; most things I agree with the majority of Washingtonians on but some things I'm completely opposed to. Perfect example is the recent attempt to tax and regulate electronic cigarettes into the ground whilst bowing down to the cigarette companies to allow them to keep their stuff. It didn't go through but they've tried 3 times and are going to continue to do so. Sometimes this state can be a bit overbearing in how it treats it's residents. I've also come to dislike a lot of the drivers here, I feel like we don't put enough emphasis on proper training/etiquette when getting your license as we did in Wales (took my test in both places).

Washington,3djh35,Stevenmont92,2,Thu Jul 16 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"You certainly hit it right on the nose, those are all some of my favorite things about my home state. I think you're right about why WA seems so forward thinking. I think it's also because there's such a strong tech industry there, and you can't have that without being willing to embrace new concepts. On top of that, there are several large colleges fairly close to each other and for such a relatively small and sparsely populated state (there are more people in NYC than in WA) there are a huge number of different cultures and lifestyles represented. I actually agree completely with you on the negatives, although I too try to avoid focusing on them except to try to fix the issues. And it has the most variety in a fairly small area that I've ever seen. I'm glad to hear that you think so highly of my home.   P.S: Check out the rain forest if you haven't yet, my older brother and I went backpacking up there and saw 6 black bears and about 120 elk. Also I lived in Oly for a year and I think it's one of the best towns in the state, and certainly very unique."

This is one of those backward-ass statements that leads to so much hand wringing. They aren't being penalized for taking the case to trial. That's not how it works.   Just because someone else gets rewarded for taking a plea bargain, doesn't mean someone else gets penalized for not taking one. A trial is the de facto baseline. A plea bargain alters that, but it's existence is dependent on the trial. Not the other way around."

In addition to the cannon emplacements, there were multiple bunkers and fortifications built into, under and behind the hillside and even some along the beaches,  They were used as quarters for on-duty gun crews, observation posts, munition and powder magazines and storage depots.  Fort Worden is one of three former military installations that created the so called ""Triangle of Fire"" at the end of the 19th century.  The other installations were Fort Casey and Fort Flagler - along with several other, lesser known, auxiliary observation and firing stations nearby.  They were built to protect Admiralty Inlet and the rest of the Puget Sound from an enemy fleet should one have decided to attempt an attack.  They were eventually stripped of their guns (which were sent overseas to Europe to assist in WWI) and the Forts were used as barracks and locations for training for multiple military units over the years.  Eventually Fort Worden was sold to the State of Washington to be used as a juvenile detention center.  Later it became a State Park."

Washington,3cp462,CylonbabyLiam,8,Thu Jul 9 17:16:56 2015 UTC,I was born and raised in Olympia and moved to Tacoma when I moved in with my boyfriend. They are both nice places for different reasons. Tacoma is larger and grittier but there are nice neighborhoods that have charm. Olympia is weird and delightful. I love Olympia's downtown area for the quirky shops and restaurants. Olympia has the best farmers market in Washington in my opinion. There has been more crime in Olympia in recent years but nothing compared to Tacoma or Seattle. Tacoma is cheaper if you're buying a house but renting an apartment is more than in Oly. I will always love Olympia but I have grown quite fond of Tacoma as well.
Washington,3cp462,FlaccidTits,9,Thu Jul 9 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"Born and raised in Tacoma.  It's great.  I'm not a city person, waiting on my hobby farm, but it's nice for what it is and getting nicer.  Nice distance from everything.  90 minutes to the mountains, couple hours to the ocean, Puget Sound is great to be near.  45mins to Seattle or two hours to Portland (way better than Seattle).  I do like Olympia.  If I had to choose a large city besides Tacoma, that would be it for sure. Funkier than Tacoma, more expensive I'd imagine, near water and easy to get to all the outdoor activities as well.  Plus it's closer to Portland.  You really can't go wrong with either in my opinion."

But I wouldn't say either one is better.   I know people like to complain about the smell in Tacoma, but based on facts...naw, it's rare to smell anything really funky these days.  It's not 1975 anymore. Tacoma is gritty, hardworking, honest, and real.  Can't say all that about Seattle or Portland!  It's much more diverse than Olympia.  It's in the midst of a re-awakening.    Olympia has some very nice advantages.  It's small-town but with open-minded people - that's rare and nice.  But it has to do something about the derelicts - downtown is a problem.  It's not unusual to go through some places downtown and smell vomit and urine, get accosted by panhandlers, or see people passed out in alleys."

Weather is great, I think, if you can handle a bit of greyness. When the sun comes out it's amazing. You have Seattle just 45 min away for a bigger city but there's plenty to do in tacoma. With the mountains and coast just a couple hours away, and the Puget sound right there, it has everything I could ever want. Not sure about you. I think tacoma is a great place to raise a family. Since I have been gone so long I'm not sure what the rent/real estate is like right now, but it can't be any worse than what I was paying in So-Cal (effing california, it sucks).

As far as the West side goes I think the Magnusson/Ravenna area is really nice. Though I really like Kirkland, Ballard, and Edmonds as well.   Rent really depends on the size, quality, and neighborhood you want. In Kirkland I paid $900 for a one bedroom (though that has increased) and in North Seattle I pay $1350 for a one bedroom.

The job market is incredible, depending on what you have to offer an employer, we have jobs that will pay you the minimum wage ($9.50 +/-) and jobs that will pay 500 times that.

""NYC has mountains!?"" ..no  But New York State has a couple of mountain ranges.. in fact, if you've ever read or watched Last of the Mohegans.. I lived where the story took place.  ""Hold up, they filmed that movie in the Carolinas.. are you saying you're from the Carolina's now?"" What!? No..

Washington,3bnuxl,richard_lutz,2,Tue Jun 30 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"A few things to keep in mind:   Firefighters are typically some (not all) of the highest paid employees of city.  Pick any city in the state and chances are a firefighter (typically a Captain) will be in the top 5 highest paid employees.  They earn a lot of overtime.   Not making a judgement about pay here, but when you're looking to cut the fewest number of people, you get the most bang for the buck with higher paid positions.  Granted the less senior employee is who loses their job, but everyone ""bumps"" down if the more senior position gets cut. ""Town Toyota Center failed its audit""  You don't pass or fail an audit.  If memory serves, what happened is the Public Facility District which built the Center was given a ""going concern"" opinion on its financial statements.  This means that the auditor has serious doubts about the entities ability to continue operations for more than one year. EVERY general government department in EVERY city in the state is going through similar pain.  Wenatchee just has the bad luck of now having to deal with bailing out the Toyota Center.  Remember all those property tax and car tab reduction initiatives that you voted for in the 90s?  This is the result of the choices we all made as a state.  Did the fat get cut?  Yep.  Did the knife hit the bone a little bit too maybe? Its not like the mayor is picking on the firefighters specifically. Firefighters have POWERFUL unions. No elected official in their right mind picks a fight with firefighters. There's no way to win.  If cuts like this are happening to a fire department, the rest of the City is likely been gutted already.  Its a very good bet the IAFF will aggressively support whomever is running against the mayor in the next election.  Remember stories like this when you here politicians talking about ""reigning in the size of government.""  The biggest expense of most governments is personnel.  If you're going to make it smaller the easiest way is by cutting positions.  Again, not making a judgment on how you vote, just to point out that how you vote has consequences - sometimes years in the future.   Source: Former auditor who performed audits of the City of Wenatchee in the early 2000s, current Finance Director at a local government  BTW - nice job telling the story OP."
Washington,3bnuxl,jdog1977,2,Wed Jul 1 04:10:41 2015 UTC,I appreciate the feedback. I never intended to make a film to put one side against the other. It was my hope to show both sides equally. My goal was to show how poor investments by a previous mayor and city council ultimately led to a situation where the discussion of cutting members and capabilities of the fire department became a reality.  Glad you liked the film.
Washington,3bnuxl,jdog1977,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:16:40 2015 UTC,It was very well done - I thought you were as impartial as possible considering the subject matter.    Hope things calm down soon over there.

I volunteered as a support personnel with CCFD1 for a while and they know their stuff, they're very attentive to the area, and Chief Burnett is an absolute asset to the region. Combine that with the excellent management of CCFD1, I think the area is going to have more proactive fire protection. The county areas around Wenatchee certainly did."

Here is his notice that I received today at 1:24pm:    Dear fellow state employees,  You’ve likely already seen the good news, but I wanted to send you a personal note.    Legislators delivered a new two-year operating budget to my desk late last night. I will be signing the bill later today. As I had hoped and believed, legislators were able to get their job done before any disruption to state services occurred, and while I regret the unnecessary stress and concern these prolonged negotiations have caused you and the customers you serve, I am very pleased with the final budget outcome.    We’re not completely finished yet, though. While employees funded through our state operating budget are now assured they can continue working, we are still awaiting passage of the capital budget. Not passing it today will impact a few hundred employees and several contractors and vendors. I know legislators are working quickly on this, and I hope they, too, will deliver that budget to me in time to avoid any disruption to those employees and services.    This operating budget is the result of a lot of compromise. It reflects many of the priorities I laid out last December as well as those from both parties and both chambers. It includes:     Historic investments in early learning that will provide 1,600 more students access to preschool   A $1.3 billion payment into our K-12 schools with additional investments that fund all-day kindergarten and smaller class sizes in lower grades, and other programs to promote the success of our students   A tuition cut for thousands of public college students along with expanded financial aid opportunities   Restoration of funding for state parks   Mental health funding to prevent boarding of psychiatric patients and shorter wait times for those seeking competency restoration   Funding to hire more child protective and child welfare services employees.     I’m also very proud to report that the budget funds the first pay increase for state employees since 2008 in addition to an enhanced cost-of-living adjustment for teachers for next biennium. Beginning tomorrow, July 1, state employees will receive a 3 percent increase. An additional 1.8 percent increase will go into effect July 1, 2016.    Over the past several years, many of you have watched colleagues be laid off, experienced furloughs and reductions in pay, and managed a growing workload. I’m proud of how competently you’ve managed these challenges and I remained dedicated throughout this year’s legislative sessions to winning approval for your long-overdue pay raises.    Thanks for all you do. I’m hopeful that I will see all of you at work tomorrow.    Very truly yours,    Jay Inslee"

Washington,3bo626,Trtlman,3,Tue Jun 30 20:02:04 2015 UTC,"Probably way to much detail for you, but I don't know if you have been there before or first time to the area.    Fort Flagler is fairly big, but small at the same time, if that makes sense.  We camp at Fort Flagler, alot.  How far you can walk South towards Nordland depends solely on the tides, and I wouldn't really suggest it as once the tides start coming up, it would put you up on a lot of rocks.    We walk on the beach from the campground area, East going around towards the lighthouse.  Flagler also has a ton of trails.  Our favorite is to take the trail through the bunkers from the campground all the way to the conference area then back to the campground on the road.  You can check out the bunkers; if you gecocache the campground has a lot of new ones to see; and is a great park if you have a bike.  I don't know too much about the tours, but i'm sure they are great.  The park is chock full of history.  Take a drive to Port Townsend, if you haven't ever been there. It lays across the bay and takes about 25 minutes.   It is a great town.  If you do go there, take an hour or so and check out Fort Worden.  Also, depending upon the weather and what campsite you are in (beach or forest), nothing beats sitting and watching all the boat traffic.  You see everything that comes and goes from Seattle from the cruise ships to cargo ships."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see.

Washington,3bbcvy,bsblake1,7,Sat Jun 27 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"The state incentives for producing energy with solar are drastically higher if you use Washington-made panels and inverters. (see http://www.a-rsolar.com/solar-incentives-washington/)  Through 2020, if you use products made outside the state, you receive $0.15/kWh produced (regardless of whether you use it or not). If you use a Washington-made inverter it increases to $0.18/kWh. If you use a Washington-made inverter and panels, it skyrockets to $0.54/kWh. Note that this is whether you use the energy or not.  (http://cleantechnica.com/2014/07/29/americas-best-solar-incentives-are-in-washington/). Just think. A typical household uses about 909kWh per month, so this ends up being about $5890 per year in incentives if on average you produce your entire consumption averaged over the whole year. A self installation of this size would be about $12k-15k before the federal incentives.  So, for a self-install (labor for installation can be as much as 60% of and install), the 30% of costs deducted from federal taxes (can be spread over multiple years), the state incentive, and net metering, it can reduce the time to payback to just 2-4 years."

The one that will affect thousands of people is the WDFW not being able to operate. Hunter education classes, which are taught by volunteers, have been told that they cannot be held if the state shuts down. This means hundreds of potential students will most likely have to be told ""Sorry, we cant have class. You'll have to find something else that will fit your schedule."" And also since WDFW will not be allowed to operate, that means licensing offices will be closed. People will not be able to purchase hunting/fishing licenses.  I don't care what your thoughts on hunting and fishing are. This is just one example of services that will be stopped during a state government shutdown.

Washington,3avvpg,adamnemecek,6,Tue Jun 23 22:38:21 2015 UTC,"While I'd support it 100%, I don't think people in Washington are really driving the poaching market.  I'm gonna pitch this to George Carlin.  Edit:   since 2010 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confiscated more than 50 elephant products entering Washington, in addition to parts of tigers, leopards and other animals.   If I really wanted to speculate, a majority of these are aged-to-antique ivory art pieces, which are generally confiscated if not documented as having been produced before international bans went into place. I'm sure there's a piano with ivory keys in there somewhere too. These aren't people crossing into Washington with whole elephant tusks, but probably some old couple who drive up to Vancouver to go antiquing and find a beautiful carving that they don't know is ivory."
Washington,3avvpg,Ranzear,3,Wed Jun 24 05:05:01 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the legal ivory market is a cover for the illegal ivory market. This is complicated by the fact that conclusively distinguishing old ivory from new ivory is impossible without lab equipment. As a result, the US is currently the second largest consumer of illegal ivory in the world, right after China (it should be noted that China has promised to start cracking down on this in recent months). While you might be right that Washington isn't the leading state in consumption of ivory, the more states pass these laws, the larger the likelihood that all states will pass these laws."
Washington,3avvpg,Ranzear,0,Wed Jun 24 05:18:45 2015 UTC,Devil's advocate time then:   Conclusively distinguishing old ivory from new ivory is impossible without lab equipment.   Are you going to afford grandma and grandpa this testing when they come back from Victoria Island with perfectly-legal native-carved walrus tusk that customs misidentifies?  The '50 products' stat says absolutely nothing about actually catching anyone smuggling ivory. Increasing penalties does not increase the number of smugglers you catch. Take a look at the war on drugs for how much it might actually deter them in the end.  I just feel like we could do a lot better than redundancy with national and international law and fines and penalties that do little for an already dead animal.
Washington,3avvpg,Ranzear,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:35:09 2015 UTC,"Are you going to afford grandma and grandpa this testing when they come back from Nova Scotia with perfectly-legal native-carved walrus tusk that customs misidentifies?   You are aware that they might not be able to import that piece of ivory as of today regardless of whether that law is passed or not right?    The '50 products' stat says absolutely nothing about actually catching anyone smuggling ivory. Increasing penalties does not increase the number of smugglers you catch.   The law isn't just about increasing penalties, it's above all about banning the sales of ivory period. This would increase the number of smugglers caught because it's hard to tell legal ivory from illegal ivory but it's relatively easy to recognize ivory.   I just feel like we could do a lot better than redundancy with national and international law and fines and penalties that do little for an already dead animal.   I mean what are your suggestions?"
Washington,3avvpg,Ranzear,0,Wed Jun 24 05:39:37 2015 UTC,"I suddenly wasn't sure if Nova Scotia even has walruses or natives, heh.  Even New York's ban includes exemptions for musical instruments.  I don't mean to shoot the whole law down, but it does seem more like a Paul Allen PR thing than a real solution to the first-to-third world economics of the trade. By the time that ivory hits our shore for us to apply this law the animal is already dead, just to put it in practical terms."
Washington,3avvpg,super_wizard,2,Wed Jun 24 05:43:49 2015 UTC,"but it does seem more like a Paul Allen PR thing   So if anyone famous/rich cares about anything it's only for PR?   By the time that ivory hits our shore for us to apply this law the animal is already dead, just to put it in practical terms.   I mean of course it will not stop poaching overnight. What will happen though is that the demand in the US will go down, as a result the price will go down and eventually it will not be profitable to poach elephants if there is no demand for ivory."
Washington,3avvpg,googlecacheguy,0,Wed Jun 24 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"demand in the US will go down, as a result the price will go down and eventually it will not be profitable   Are we using the drug trade as a model for this?"

The cell contained no food, water or bathroom facilities.  Five days later when he was found, he had to be hospitalized for several days for a variety of medical problems. The incident touched off a national furor, resulting in several investigations and a $20 million claim filed against the DEA. The incident has been described as a ""Kafkaesque nightmare,""  a ""debacle,"" and ""one of the worst cases of its kind.""

Washington,3a8tfk,gaviidae,2,Fri Jun 19 00:36:38 2015 UTC,"Lots of great places in Northern Washington and the Olympic Peninsula but since you're living up there if you really want to get away you should check out Mt. St. Helens. The western road up to Johnston Ridge is a nice day trip but those in the know go to the south end of Mt. St. Helens through Cougar. Ape Cave is a unique place to explore, Trail of Two Forests is a quick visit to an amazing geologic example, June Lake is a nice hike to a fun waterfall, and Lava Canyon is just awesome. Lava Canyon trail is either a short loop or a much longer trail depending on what you want to do.  And if you have even more time visit the Columbia Gorge."

Washington,3a4q0w,Agora_Olympia,2,Wed Jun 17 14:39:19 2015 UTC,Are you certain that is looking south?  Seems like the water should be a lot closer than the end point of this view.  Also the street seems to be rising in the distance which shouldn't be true of any south running street through downtown.  I would suggest perhaps looking east?
Washington,3a4q0w,SteelePhoenix,2,Wed Jun 17 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"The water (and the Tenderloin District) would be behind the photographer (to the North). On the left side of the street you can see the western face of the Chambers Block, which is still there.

I searched all around on Google Maps seeing if I could identify any of the buildings in the photo, but I came up empty handed. The Capitol Theater looks fairly close to that big building on the right side of the photo, but it's missing a floor (is there an Underground Olympia I'm not aware of?) and that would have this photo looking west where there's no hill (or at least not one as close as this photo appears)."

Washington,3a2sip,toenailsmcgee,20,Tue Jun 16 19:54:28 2015 UTC,"I think to define Moses Lake with the words ""has a gang problem"" would be a gross over generalization.

Mention my road in my town, and people go white in the face and put their hands on their purses, yet, the road is lined with fresh cut grass, professional landscaping, has a golf course and park, and as I type, Im watching small children ride their bicycles without a care in the world."

I didn't see any or hear of any in my short time there. shrug But many rural towns do have drug problems, and Moses Lake is on I-90, so I guess it wouldn't surprise me if it were a transit point for illegal drugs or something."
Washington,3a2sip,imaskingwhy,6,Tue Jun 16 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"I currently live in Moses Lake, and my only exposure to gang activity is because I'm a criminal defense attorney. Try calling the Vintage apartment complex - there are people there who have large dogs.  Also, Soap Lake is a shithole. I mean, even more so than most of the small towns in Eastern WA. Ephrata isn't a terrible place to live, and it's about 20-30 mins up the road from Moses Lake."
Washington,3a2sip,justcallmetarzan,4,Wed Jun 17 01:33:32 2015 UTC,"I went to the vintage today and they have a weight restriction (which is completely arbitrary as far as I'm concerned). Needless to say, my dog exceeds it by quite a bit."

Washington,3a2sip,Dudeicca,2,Wed Jun 17 05:25:13 2015 UTC,I agree because my dog is very small for a dane and much more well behaved than most people's dogs.
Washington,3a2sip,Wh0pCh0p,10,Wed Jun 17 05:29:38 2015 UTC,"You're going to find ""gang"" activity in any small town with enough pissed off 20 somethings. They mostly fight amongst themselves though. Where on earth do you live currently that you aren't concerned about the people around you? I'd bet you there's gangs where you live now that you're just not aware of. If you're east of the mountains especially you're going to be seeing a lot of ""gang"" activity. The Seattle Times did an article on it.   If you're concerned about gangs, first consider that they don't JUST run around doing malevolent acts and being shitty. Many groups of 'thugs' will collectively spend money at a local store so it doesn't go under, saving the closest grocery store for a bunch of people or just hang around with one another and go fishing. Nobody talks about them just doing peaceful things together because it's not flashy, it's not shocking and it doesn't bring in the readers. There are a lot of small town farmers who'd be considered members of an active gang who just do their thing and host meetings once in a while where they all get together and relax or talk. Generally speaking you're never going to see these guys act like ""gang members"" unless you are buying drugs, prostitutes or gambling on the street.   I might also get a lot of shit for this, but if you're moving to Washington you should also know there are several active white pride groups. If you're some non-white skinned color don't worry, they won't hunt you down in your home or light burning crosses on your yard. They focus largely on improving their home communities and stopping their own from being bad examples. I've heard plenty a bar story of them following a guy after he hit his girlfriend, beating the hell out of him and telling him they'd be watching that he didn't do it again.   HOWEVER, theft is another issue altogether. Small town theft is rampant and usually motivated by drug addiction. If you're concerned about home theft use blinds in parts of your house that you're not in often, back rooms, bedroom windows and such. Open windows are like a buffet table for a drug addict with little foresight. Having a dog already is a wonderful thing, he'll alert you and scare off potential thieves. If you have a garage don't store things in it that you couldn't cope with losing. Put motion sensor lights over the doorways and your garage door if applicable, they scare the piss out of someone trying to find their way in. Leave a TV running or music on a computer blaring if you'll be out for a while, it makes it hard to gauge for a thief whether or not someone is there so they often won't test it. If you're not a dick to your neighbors they'd chase people off for you, provided it was a neighborhood and not a little house in the middle of nowhere. If you're REALLY paranoid you can make sure your doors are solid hardwood with deadbolts but most thieves who'd try to break the door would just break a window at that point.   If you're concerned, don't look for ""no gang"" areas, look for areas that are not filled with low-income homes. Below a certain level of poverty most people receive poor educations. Without education all racial stereotypes are true, everyone is a piece of shit and everyone is addicted to drugs. A high-income neighborhood would be safer if you're planning on building a family with your wife."

Washington,3a2sip,Telzara,3,Wed Jun 17 01:28:42 2015 UTC,Ellensburg may work out well except for the occasional trip to Kennewick or Spokane. The only other issue I can see with Ellensburg is that my wife needs to work as well. I will have her look in to nanny positions out there.
Washington,3a2sip,fruitarmada,2,Wed Jun 17 04:15:29 2015 UTC,"Both Kennewick and Spokane are only about 2 hours away from Ellensburg, which isn't too bad. I had a friend that worked as a nanny all through college there and was constantly turning down people who wanted her to nanny so your wife shouldn't have too much difficulty there. Housing is pretty abundant and reasonable. Depending on where you live most college kids aren't bad, though as you can imagine some areas around campus can be a little loud. Overall it's a really nice area with a lovely downtown and a fair amount to do, especially if you like the outdoors."

A large part of the beaches along the coast are either reservation or National parks. I suggest you  get a map of the coast, find a beach you like and check the tides for the time you want to go. You can't always camp on the beaches, but there are sometimes nearby campgrounds.   If you drive about an hour off the 101 there is the Hoh Rainforest where there is a small loop trail through the hall of mosses. I took my parents on that. they're not in great shape and in their 60's.   I am not aware of any beaches that allow driving on them. Someone else might know more than that.   Mt. St. helens is off I-5, Mt. Rainier isn't though. There's a variety of ways of getting there. 512 to 161 I guess.   This all very ambitious for three days honestly. You will be spending your entire time driving if you intend on trying to do all this. That's a pity because there's a lot worth seeing and doing. like tidepools, etc. but that all takes time.

Lastly, please, please, please for your safety and others be careful driving on the beach. If you go too fast you could hit someone losing control in the sand. It's hard on your vehicle and it's incredibly dangerous. A soft patch is all it takes to get stuck and spend the rest of your trip funds on calling a tow to pull out of it. The tide comes in fast, if you get stuck during low tide you could lose your vehicle or your life if you roll and lose consciousness. I've lost more than a couple acquaintances to driving on the beach. If you MUST, do it sober and white knuckled. A vehicle with 4 wheel drive is just as susceptible to getting stuck and I've seen it happen just as often as fwd or rwd cars and trucks, people get a bit cocky and get stuck. So you know, the legal speed limit for driving on the beach is 25 miles an hour and the cops in Grayland and Westport will enforce it with pleasure. Locals aren't fond of beach driving either because it can screw with the clam digs, a major source of tourist revenue."

There's federal laws against it, and furthermore there are laws restricting the freedoms of drug users. There is a huge collection of agencies and employees under cabinet level positions who enforce drug laws.   If the President directs the Attorney General to devote more resources to fighting marijuana, he wouldn't need any acts of congress or court rulings to severely diminish legal weed, and push it back to the street.   As president is the head of the executive branch, the dept of interior, the department of commerce, the FDA, the USDA, and an exhaustive list of agencies could be directed to take actions against legal weed.

Washington,38pvdw,YakBoy42,7,Sat Jun 6 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"I moved away from here in 2004 and moved back in 2014.  Three things I've observed since I've been back:  The state's transportation infrastructure is not keeping up with the growing population in urban/suburban areas.   This is not to say that Washington isn't trying and making progress faster than other states.  The I-5 Tacoma junction is a confusing work in progress.  I like the train from Seatac to downtown.  It's good that that seems to be an expanding project.  Thank your lucky stars you don't live in Norfolk, VA where they have plans to fix their traffic problem too (starting after 50 years of taxes and tolls).  Also, the ferry system, while I love a good boat ride, is going to become a burden sooner or later.  It might be 20 years from now, but it's going to happen.  There are definitely more tweakers in the rural areas than I remember.  Aberdeen is starting to look like The Walking Dead.  Meth is not unique to Washington, but outside of law enforcement, it doesn't seem to get much attention.  I think it might be sneaking in the back door while everyone is inviting weed in the front.  Homelessness isn't just part of Seattle anymore.  It's spread throughout the state in towns I wouldn't have thought I would ever see a large homeless population in (Silverdale?).  While homelessness isn't unique to Washington, it seems more widespread or maybe up close and personal than the last three states I've lived in (Virginia, Georgia, Florida).  I will admit, in GA and FL, it's sometimes hard to tell who is homeless and who is just out for a Sunday stroll.  Once again, I've been gone for ten years, so these issues might not even be issues, just observations and comparisons.  At least Rainer hasn't blown up yet, eh?"

This leaves no fresh blood to revive the localities. It is kind of a vicious cycle that is kind of sad to see.

Washington,38jbxu,cultmember,3,Thu Jun 4 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"You can also get a portable vaporizer (some work with herb, some only with oils) so you don't have to smoke it. Even if it's still not technically legal in a public setting or out in the woods, at least there's less chance of anyone noticing and lower risk of fire.  There are also edibles which last longer but tend to be rather vague about the potency and strain and plus you have to deal with the carb crash from eating dessert to get high, so I'd recommend oil capsules like these from dama. Not sure if any other brands are available recreationally."

Washington,38eai5,wanderhouston,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:25:14 2015 UTC,Sure the scenery is nice but in reality it's a redneck logging town with no jobs and a semi serious crime problem.  The ferry to Victoria is so expensive most people here rarely go.  The area is great if you're retired but then you're too old to enjoy the outdoors.  My comment wasn't that it's a horrible place to live it's just not even remotely the best outdoorsy town in WA let alone the nation.  Bellingham is a MUCH nicer place with jobs and MUCH better outdoor options accessible mostly without having to drive.  This contest was all about generating tourism dollars for the area.

Washington,383rf7,adorableheathen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been thinking about that as well, the issue is there'd be no place to park the pod at my apartment complex for a day or two, and the house we're moving to has a very narrow road that neighbors would be VERY unhappy to have block their way down to the town so I don't know how feasible it's going to be."
Washington,383rf7,DepressedWAguy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:13:45 2015 UTC,"Understandable, I had the same issue. I got around it by just shipping to the local dock and then getting movers to unload the pod, drive to the new place and unload. Sounds like a lot, but it was still cheaper than a door to door move."
Washington,383rf7,WangoBango,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"I've moved quite a bit. I've used professional companies that cost a lot, and I've used smaller companies. When I moved from San Jose to  Washington I did use a smaller company that was a ""mom and pop"" or in this case, ""pop and son."" They carefully packed my things, kept in contact with me via text the whole way, calling us asking us where we were stopping for the night and very personable ensuring that they knew our stuff was safe. In this case, he treated my things like their own. There are downsides and upsides to going cheaper or more expensive, you really have to do your research (which I know you are.) Good luck on your move. I love it up here."

Washington,37znlh,RatherNotRegister,2,Mon Jun 1 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"Look, the people saying to pick affordable or near Seattle and stuff like it are getting down voted, but they're not wrong. You should have a job in place before you move, or a budget of $5000-$10000 to tide you over. What do you mean by ""small commute""? 20 minutes? An hour? Most places where you'll find something for the $700 range are going to be in a suburb with at least an hour commute to downtown. That's part of why you should have a job first; traffic here is terrible, and you need to know where you'll be working before finding a place to live. If you must be within 20 minutes of downtown and want to pay under $1000, you're probably looking at a room in a house with multiple residents."

Washington,37znlh,zeneval,2,Sun May 31 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"It's free one-way going from Bremerton to Seattle.  You telling me you spend less than ~250 per month on fuel and maintenance to commute by vehicle?  For under $1000/m, you're not gonna find a place to live where you can commute in under an hour, that's two hours of driving per day. At least on the ferry you can do other things, walk around, read, etc...  Most vehicles will get around 15-20 MPG. You'd be driving like 60+ miles per day to commute to/from Seattle and live somewhere that is ""cheap"". You're gonna be paying at least 3 dollars per gallon, and that's if you're lucky. Assume best case, sitting in stop and go rush hour traffic, that you get 20 MPG, that's at least 3 gallons of gas used per day, in reality you'll be using more. That's already $9 per day, assuming best-case scenarios, and that doesn't include maintenance on your vehicle, insurance costs going up because you commute, etc...  The ferry ain't so bad, ""bro"", and neither is Bremerton. One could easily find a small house if lucky, or a nice duplex or apartment for around $750/m in Bremerton."
Washington,37znlh,ihaveapentax,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"I realize that. I commuted for three years. I'm just saying, it's a lot of time, too. I took two buses (one on each side of the water) and a ferry, totaling 15 hours a week of time commuting on public transit. If I had had the opportunity to live in Seattle, with roommates (I was living in Bremerton with roommates), I would have just to have to commute less time (my situation at the time prevented it). Plus, if you're driving a car (which I have to as a freelancer), it costs money each way to ride the ferry, AND you're betting that you're never late and miss a ferry and always get a spot.   So in addition to cost of ferry pass, you need two bus passes (or an ORCA card)  Edit: clarity and also:  I wanted to add what a typical commuting day looked like, for OP to take into consideration. I typically took the 7:20 ferry daily, and if I had to be early I took the 6:20. I lived in Manette, so this had me getting up at 5:30 for the 7:20 ferry (so I could be at my destination by 9). Coming home, I'd be done around 3-5pm, depending on the day. So I'd have to take the 4:20, 5:35, or 6:20 ferry. Again, heavy commuter ferries, even as a walk on sometimes they'd run out of room. I'd end up home by (if taking the 6:20, which tended to be the most frequently taken boat) 8. That's a really long fucking day for anyone, bro."
Washington,37znlh,zeneval,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not ideal if you don't work downtown Seattle or live near downtown Bremerton. I lived on the far end of Pacific Ave so it was an easy 10 minute walk to the ferry, or 5 minute leisurely bike ride. Shit, even if it was a 30 minute or an hour walk, I'd be okay with that. It's good exercise, and a great way to start the day... or you can get a bike incase you're ever running late. People are so fucking lazy these days...  Like I said, no way you'll find something under $1000/m close to Seattle... If you want cheap, commuting is necessary. I'd think most people would much rather have 15 hours of time NOT driving that they can spend doing other things rather than 15 hours of driving. That's 15 hours you can spend working, relaxing, reading, napping, whatever... vs driving, you must stay alert and focused on the road.  I've never seen the ferry fill up, even during Seahawks games, I don't think getting a spot is a problem.  Either way, to each their own, nobody is trying to force you to ride the ferry, chill out man. Everyone saying ""pick one, cheap or Seattle"" is right. And if you want cheap, commuting on the ferry is, in my opinion, your best option."
Washington,37znlh,RatherNotRegister,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"I've seen ferries fill up. In fact, on more than one occasion I've missed the ferry by 1 car, 3 cars, etc. My partner and I are currently relocating, moving back to the other side of the water, because ferries add a lot of stress for our lives. If we could walk on, like you said, that would be one thing, but we usually can't."

Ashford has a really old general store. All the areas around Mt. Rainier can be really hard, or impossible to access in the winter though. In fact, only Paradise is open year round. And it depends entirely on road conditions and you must be carrying chains regardless.   Some other small towns not near Mt. Rainier. Leavenworth and Winthrop and cute. Leavenworth is pretty accessible year round. Winthrop might be impossible to get to.

It was time for a change, we took a chance, and we love it here. We have some family near and others all over the area (3 states).   Outside of Seattle and Tacoma, it's a lot of small-town mentality. That's usually charming. Even in the Olympia-Tumwater area. As a former big city girl, it occasionally gets to me, but if I drive 30 minutes north, that's plenty urban enough.  The long winter nights can be tough on people. I've also heard complaints about driving to work and back home in the dark, or the low sunrise/sunset shining in your eyes on the commute. It just made me plan my living situation and think about my employment situation more. Live east and work west, as the conventional wisdom goes, so the sun is always at your back.  Rain. And the marine layer, which is just hoverrain. I love it, because you can't live in a rainforest without rain. Not everyone does, but you can't let it stop you or you'll never get out!  So...

When talking about these things you often hear ""it doesn't rain as much as people think.""  This is true.  What they don't tell you is that it is perpetually overcast.  If you have any interest in sun being around more than two months out of the year WA is not for you.  Or if you are like me (and possibly many others) you just start taking supplements to make up for the lack of sun.  They also don't talk about beaches.  If you're into going swimming in the summer, you won't be swimming at a beach because the water is cold and the beaches are not sand.  Instead you'll end up at some local river where you have to make sure the melting mountain snow hasn't turned the water into a hypothermic death trap.  The rivers are awesome, but often I miss swimming in the ocean.  People are weird here.  They're nice, sure.  But very flaky and won't look you in the eye when talking.

I have always told my wife that we will move back to WA at some point due to the following reasons:    The climate is far better than that of PA.  The Puget Sound; It is hard to not like the fact that you can boat/canoe/etc. all over the PS for years and still find new and interesting places.  The people: Not everyone is nice (I say it is because of the damned Californians moving there), but there certainly is a distinct lack of the Northeast ""attitude"".  Also, I find people to be nicer, in general.  The outdoors: In PA, I can rarely go out and hike wherever I want due to poison oak/sumac/ivy (highly allergic).  Also, if it is 95 degrees and 100% humidity, hiking tends to be tedious and contain a large amount of suck.  In WA, you can go just about anywhere without finding poison of any kind (I am not saying it is not there, you just have to go out of your way to find it).  There are so many national parks, beaches, rivers, etc. that you would be hard-pressed to run out of things to do there.  The beauty and diversity of the state: WA has rain forests, deserts, mountain ranges, rivers, lakes...essentially, I think the state is an aesthetic wonderland.  Even though I grew up there, whenever I go back, I am still in awe of how amazing it is.   Cons (because,  you cannot have one without the other, right?):   Traffic: If you move to Seattle or work in Seattle, you had better start your commute early.  I-5 runs right through the city (under a building, actually) and cannot be expanded; That makes for a pretty horrendous commute.  Traffic is pretty bad all over, so choose your home and work locations wisely. Oh, and, slow drivers in the left lane.  People will camp out in the left lane and drive the speed limit.  I know, adhering to the law is so gauche, right?  However, that is a big reason why you get traffic, too.  It seems like it has gotten a little better, but I am still not convinced they have come close to eradicating that behavior. um...I honestly cannot think of any other cons.  I guess I am too biased after growing up there.   Should you move there?  It is up to you.  However, if you love the outdoors and nicer people, it is the perfect place."
Washington,37gdob,ChonkyTonks,3,Wed May 27 13:31:08 2015 UTC,Those are my top priorities. I have lived in PA for the majority of my life and was not happy there. Moved further south where I get to experience true traffic. And still have not found my true home yet. When I was there it was amazing! Thanks so much for your reply!
Washington,37gdob,laurenkk,2,Wed May 27 13:44:38 2015 UTC,"PA really sucks, don't it?  I am absolutely ready to get out of this state.  Good luck with your endeavors.  I am hopeful that it will end up being your true home."
Washington,37gdob,kelevra206,2,Wed May 27 14:22:34 2015 UTC,It really does never a good climate for anything. Thanks and I hope you make back!
Washington,37gdob,kelevra206,2,Wed May 27 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Tacoma (30 mins south of Seattle) for my first 30 years, and spent my last 3 in Longview, pretty damn small in comparison, in SW WA, and with a much more depressed economy.  You can't go wrong as far as scenery goes.  Seattle traffic sucks, as does just south of Olympia heading north.  I used to commute to Seattle from Tacoma and would never do it again for any amount of money. There's too much to do here!  Ocean, mountains, desert(ish) in eastern WA.  Canada's just up north. The rain has never felt like a thing to me.  I don't see why anyone even makes comments about it unless they're from eastern WA where it's super dry.  There's no reason to keep away from WA.  I love it, can't imagine living anywhere else.  No income tax!    You'll just want to be sure that your work skills are super marketable."
Washington,37gdob,kelevra206,2,Wed May 27 14:56:15 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your input! I understand bad traffic being from DC. So I understand what it's like to not go any where during certain times of day just because it's every where.
Washington,37gdob,thevough,2,Wed May 27 15:03:32 2015 UTC,Where in WA are you looking to move? The story is going to be very different depending on what area we're talking about.
Washington,37gdob,angelkirie,2,Wed May 27 18:07:30 2015 UTC,Honestly I was looking like Everett or further east.
Washington,37gdob,kilamumster,3,Wed May 27 18:40:07 2015 UTC,"Well, the pros/cons of Everett are going to be completely different from that of the Seattle area.  I have admittedly not spent enough time in Everett to weigh in on this one.  I grew up in Seattle but now live in the Tri-Cities on the east side of the state."
Washington,37gdob,killaMC,2,Wed May 27 18:44:57 2015 UTC,So what would be your biggest complaints about that area? I can find all the good things about most places but not really get a sense of how the people are in the different areas.
Washington,37gdob,kelevra206,2,Wed May 27 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"I can't remember my time in Everett well enough to have a complaint.  My only complaints about Seattle are the traffic and cost of living.  I miss Seattle every day.  I can't testify to the Seattle Freeze as I grew up there, but I haven't found the residents of any big city anywhere in the world to be more friendly, so I don't really know what people are talking about. Eastern Washington is actually pretty great if you're not looking for the big city environment."
Washington,37gdob,Your_Wasted_Life,2,Wed May 27 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I like having it available but not really looking in the city. I need more greenery and sky then towers."
Washington,37gdob,KaitlynnBree,2,Wed May 27 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm late! I live in the Bothell/Mill Creek area, just minutes away from Everett. I spend a lot of my time in Everett, too, since my school was in the Everett District and most of the businesses I go to are there. It's a somewhat sudden shift from upper middle class to lower middle class when you go to certain parts of Everett, but that's subjective on your part.  I live in a really good suburban community that's well taken care of. I also love the greenery here and you will get a lot of it if you move to WA. Where I live is becoming more and more popular though, and houses and businesses are rapidly being built at the cost of what once were forest areas. I think it's the perfect mesh of the big city and more rural areas, and many people agree. It's just the right distance from Seattle, if you're interested in that. And if you're into outdoor recreation and want a community who feels the same, this is a right fit. If you have any questions about the area, let me know!"

That said, it does have nice neighborhoods. It seems like the definition of 'Seattle' is widening every year, so now would be a good time to buy, before people who work in Seattle but can't afford to live there are pushed out that far. Everett only stands to get better in the future, I'm seeing quite a few tech and geek based companies moving there. (Funko, Geek Chic, etc) Also, r/Everett.  Going east of Everett gets country real quick. Lake Stevens is a wonderful community, also growing super quick but with a slightly higher price point. Snohomish is a cutesy little town with a lot of antique shops, very cozy. I wouldn't go much further east than Monroe, it gets 'meth-in-a-trailer-with-a-goose-for-a-guard-dog' kinda sketchy after that."

Washington,37gdob,whygook,3,Wed May 27 21:45:47 2015 UTC,"The biggest con I can think of in WA is drought. People paid big money to live on Lake Tapps in Bonney Lake. It used to be gorgeous, but this year there was little snowpack, and little rain, so the lake won't fill. They're even worried about there being enough water for salmon in certain nearby streams. Just one example of how the climate is changing here.  Let's turn that con into a pro! Property values in Bonney Lake are fucking tanking, so a place that used to be a lot more pricey to live is really cheap right now. Maybe buyers will get lucky and it'll rain more or snow more next year..."

Only difference is the assertion that somehow the sentencing in this already tried case is more dangerous to the public than bullets.  The convict is terminally ill. His wife left him over the case. He's going to die alone and reviled, slowly and painfully over the next couple of years. He's now a high-profile, registered sex offender in a small town. He's been sentenced to 3 years of parole, which is longer than he's likely to live.  Put him in jail and you're only volunteering to cover his medical expenses. In fact, jail might benefit him more than it would benefit the community - he's not able to remain anonymous enough to pose a risk to anyone, and jailing him will cost us a fortune while he enjoys climate control, 3 hots & a cot."

It'll kill the deal. You know it will. The only deal the American public will be happy with is one that only benefits us. It's not going to have reasonable concessions. It's not going to take into account that other countries are going to want something too. It's either all us, or nothing. The American public can't even agree on something as simple as evolution. You think we're capable of passing reasoned judgement on a complicated trade deal?   I want the best deal we can get. If we don't have any deal, we get left out while everyone else is trading with each other, and that's going to hurt us. So I put it to the best economic minds we have to do that negotiation for us. I wish I knew what was in the deal, and I wish I understood it, but I know that's not a reasonable expectation. And it'd be even worse if people were allowed to add amendments to completely screw it up with their own private or lobbied interests, which is what a non-fast track bill would be.   The biggest problem that no one ever seems to talk about in politics is simply that no one trusts the government to do anything.

Washington,36ttwi,madox170,2,Tue May 26 01:18:53 2015 UTC,"It seems that there are two issues: getting into the university and getting into the major.  Low test scores could be problematic at either university, but more at UW than WWU.  When people talk about UW being competitive they are mostly talking about getting into the CS major.  Unless you're trying to get a ""direct admit"" at UW, which is very hard to do, SAT or ACT scores shouldn't affect whether you get into the major.  At both universities, your performance in a set of lead-in classes will largely determine whether you're admitted into the major or not.  At UW, it's very difficult to jump this hurdle.  At WWU, it's easier, but there is a hurdle (more than there was in the past)."

If you're trying to find a decent teaching position you'll want to stay in the king county area.  Some great smaller cities up north are  Kirkland  Redmond  Issaquah Mount lake terrace  On the south side there are some nice cities too like  Des monies  Bowns point Edgewood  And Milton.  The cost of living is much higher up north. Rent prices are at an all time high right now so try to buy if you can. Washington really is a great state to live.

Are you young and need nightlife or social opportunities? Avoid the Olympic Peninsula and find somewhere within an hour of Tacoma, Olympia, Seattle or Spokane. If you plan on flying more than once every several years, make sure you're within 3 hours of Seattle. The little things about the geography and activity/social opportunities are important factors to consider. Price, too. Cost of living varies greatly as well.

We probably would either need to fly, or have family wanting to fly in since we wouldn't be anywhere close to our relatives.   Cost of living is definitely a factor. We ideally would want to buy a house right off the bat to avoid paying rent. So affordable housing is a huge plus. We don't need anything huge or fancy, but we also don't want our only options to be run down or falling apart.   Even though we don't need an active night life, we would like to live somewhere where there is a decent amount of people our age.

Spokane has 3 Universities near it that all pump out teaching graduates yearly so finding teaching work in that area is likely to be very difficult.  However, there are tons of small towns that are in need of teachers.  I'd probably look more towards Tri-Cities if you prefer dryer climates, however renting down there is terrible due to the Hanford area bringing in a bunch of work that pays well but isn't super secure, funding has been getting cut fairly regularly, which means job losses, so many people working out there are renters.

Washington,3643wc,cakes_and_pies,1 point,Fri May 15 23:20:02 2015 UTC,Just checked it out on my 4K monitor.  Looks awesome.  Did you stitch a few shots together?  What are the details on lens?  Looks like you used a 5D Mark III.
Washington,3643wc,Proph3T08,3,Fri May 15 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's composed of 14 images. I overlapped the images more than I normally do for pano shots because I was trying to avoid distortion. The lens I used is the Canon 135mm F/2L with the 5D MKIII. I cropped it to the 16:8 aspect ratio, which slimmed down the image slightly. It would've been a little larger if I hadn't.   Edit: ISO 100, f/8, shutter: 1/800th"

Washington,36084k,anarrespress,7,Fri May 15 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 85%. (I'm a bot)     AMY GOODMAN: On Tuesday, the Port of Seattle voted to seek the blockade of rigs used by the oil giant Shell for its planned drilling in the Arctic.  What the Greenpeace activists were doing was that they were shining a spotlight on what Shell is doing, so that the rest of the world can actually understand what is happening right here, right now, and that they were heading right toward Seattle at the time, so it really galvanized so much of the movement right here in Seattle.  The Port of Seattle wants to pretend that it's listening to the people, but actually the Port of Seattle is completely corrupt, and they are bought and paid for by Shell, by Foss, and they are not listening to the people.
