trashy,3dvsiu,angelcakester,12,Mon Jul 20 00:26:49 2015 UTC,"My little cousins both could, we would go to ihop, get three of the pancake breakfasts and I would eat one or two of mine, then divvy up my extras to them because theirs were GONE. Sometimes they would still be hungry and we would get a short stack to split between them, usually no leftovers there either. (When we started this one was almost 2, one was 4, but the 4yo could eat three full pancakes earlier, he just wouldn't have eaten any eggs or meat.)  They weren't fat kids either, actually the older one was chronically underweight. (Could not get him to gain weight for years, he was a scrawny constantly sick kid despite my best efforts, his sister was sometimes a bit chubby but it disappeared by the time she was 3, then she got chubby again when puberty hit.)  Little kids often can eat a lot more than you would think, especially an active kid. And some kids get very volatile when hungry. I used to have to take the Little Bits I mentioned above and walk them up and down the street outside a restaurant if our food didn't come fast enough or they would've gotten hysterical at seeing other tables get food while they were hungry. (They had food issues, before they came to live with us their mother would forget to feed them, sometimes for a day or more, so when they got hungry they got very difficult. Thankfully most places will rush an appetizer if you ask nicely and explain that your kids have trouble handling hunger.)"

They kill check average ($ per seat per hour is how restaurants track their performance.  You have seats full of kids ordering $4 meals instead of $12-15 entrees, you feel it in your bottom line).

trashy,3dvsiu,Brodie1985,17,Mon Jul 20 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"How are they supposed to learn to behave if they don't come out in public?   I am NOT saying letting your toddler scream in a restaurant, or a store for that matter, is okay, when dining with small kids I will remove them to outside to wait out tantrums, and have actually been known to ask the server if they will box our food and give me a shout outside when our bill is ready when they will not settle down. And you know what? Kids who I take out don't usually misbehave more than once or twice. Because they love going out with me and even a 3 year old realizes ""If I scream or yell, I have to leave and Aunt Kitten won't take me again, but if I use my quiet voice I get to go out with her more and she will get me dessert.""  Which is how you breed the well mannered children people don't usually notice in a public setting. Who become (hopefully, none of my Littles have gotten old enough to confirm this) well mannered adults who are also a joy to share a public place with.  But saying kids shouldn't be in public is short sighted and makes your message worthless because people with good kids discount you for being too broad, and people with shitty kids, well they don't listen anyway.  (If you ever find yourself with a hungry, angry kid and no choice but to go to a restaurant, ask the server if they can rush an appetizer, then if you can, take the kid outside and walk the parking lot a bit. A lot of the time will stop the tantrum, and when it doesn't stop it immediately, it brings the noise out away from other diners. before you say ""just leave them at home"" these aren't my own personal kids or I would be getting the check, tipping well and taking their asses home, I'm talking when family drags you out and their kids are throwing fits from hunger.)"
trashy,3dvsiu,harmoniouschaos,3,Mon Jul 20 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"They aren't going to learn how to behave if they are allowed to get away with kicking up fuss and having no consequences , are they?   or telling a server to put their order on rush, just showing the precious little snowflake that they are more important than anyone else in the world.   How about parents taking responsibility for their choices. Take a snack with them if snowflake can't handle a wait on food. Remove your child if it's having a screaming fit and pissing off everyone else in the vicinity.   Or just take your child to a kid oriented restaurant"
trashy,3dvsiu,Sivirthedestroyer06,0,Mon Jul 20 18:29:07 2015 UTC,"Where do you get the idea there are no consequences? I don't put up with tantrums in public any more than I must and my tiny kinfolk all know that. (My aunt once bitched at me that I was ""too mean"" because my cousin did not throw food when he went out with me so I must be treating him badly and making him afraid of me. Nope, he just knows that if he acts like a cultured gentleman with me instead of a raging hell spawn we're getting dessert after dinner and I don't eat much sugar so he will have all but a bite or two to himself.) I am the bitch that you see storming out of a restaurant with my hand over a screamer's mouth.  I'm not the parent, I'm the constantly suffering childless aunt/cousin who will be officially out of the family I refuse to spend time with people and I do take the screaming children out of the building.  And I have never once had a server respond to ""What is the fastest appetizer we can get? Can we get that out as soon as possible please?"" with any sort of implication that I am putting my niece/nephew/cousin above anyone else. Usually I get a ""Alright, that's the cheese sticks, coming right up, would you like some crayons?"" (The answer is yes, yes I do want some crayons. Even if there aren't any kids with me I want them.) Again, not the parent or I would've taken the kid to the place to eat WAY sooner and there would be granola bars or something to keep the fussing down. (actually, I usually do have snacks in my purse. Those soft belivta cookies, half of one of those is enough to keep a hungry toddler quiet until the food arrives in case you ever need to know that fact. But when there are five or six small kids at a table and I'm the only adult who gives a shit? Not enough.)   My family seem to think that feeding a kid at noon, saying dinner is at 5 and then gabbing their fool heads until 8 is fine and can't see why we have whimpering cranky kids.  And what exactly do you consider to be a kid oriented restaurant? No hate or snark, I'm genuinely curious because the only place I have ever had someone bitch about the way kids I am dining with are behaving was at Burger King.   I've gone to $30+ a plate resturaunts with small kids and I've gone to Chuck E cheese but my rules are the same, if it is MY idea to go, screaming kids will be removed, food and drinks will be paid for, servers will be tipped even if all they have done is bring out drinks and I will NOT take that particular kid out again for at least several months because it is embarrassing as hell to have a kid meltdown when you thought they would behave themselves. If I am stuck with family and a meltdown starts, I'll volunteer to take them outside for awhile to get it out of their system because generally I am not consulted on anything and they just expect that I'll play Child Whisperer and make the kids behave.  I now live five states away from any of these people. When I have my own kids we will NOT have meltdowns in public, I'll drag them to the car and take their ass home. (My mother did it to me twice when I was around 3 and apparently I learned because my next public fit was at 18 when I had my wisdom teeth out and for some reason the news station playing in a diner made me start crying against the table.)"

I don't go to those places because I don't want kids screaming around me. From the looks of the place it's a small place run by a woman who doesn't hold back. If you need the whole treat me like I am the best thing ever and allow my child to be horrible, you should probably go to a corporate restaurant. Why should my meals be ruined because you cannot control your child and did not use protection?"

trashy,3dvbi0,figureinplastic,23,Sun Jul 19 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, the trashiest person I know (and I say that with love, but the fact remains the man fathered his first child at 15 and is now a grandpa to four at 43.) managed to explain homosexuality to a six year old without resorting to nasty words. (he's my cousin, one of the decent ones)   6yo: Why does Uncle kiss a guy? Cousin: Cuz he's gay. 6yo: What's gay? Cousin: Means he likes other men the way some men like ladies. 6yo: Why? Cousin: God made him like that. It happens sometimes. 6yo: Is it okay if I like girls when I'm grown. Cousin: That's between you and Jesus, but if you love them, its probably okay. Loving someone's better than being a hateful rotten person.   And then he went back to watching wrestling.  Actually, I think most things can be explained pretty easily with ""God made him/her/it like that. It happens sometimes.""   If you're atheist it wouldn't work though. Maybe sub ""That's how he/she/it was made."" instead? I dunno, I try to be understanding to atheists but I'm probably not. I send the ones I know holiday cards with snowy scenes and wish them a happy winter because not sending a card seems so rude when their siblings/friends etc. will get one from me. And I don't pray for them unless they tell me I can. (I still got told I was a bitch for sending a Christmas card last year. It didn't say anything about Christmas, but I guess I was being insensitive.)  Seriously though, I think I've figured out vegans (nothing animal like at all) and I've figured out Jewish and Muslim folk (no pig, no shellfish, no cheese on their meat, eh hell, I'll just make the vegan stuff for them too.) but I still am not quite sure about athiests. I know four of them and one I can't do anything right for her, and the other three send me wintery holiday type cards back and seem okay with me slipping up and telling them I'll pray for them on occasion."
trashy,3dvbi0,UndeadKitten,12,Mon Jul 20 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"As an atheist, it's hard to say what is ""okay"" for others, but as long as you don't say ""I'll pray for you"" condescendingly towards me, I have no problem with someone telling me that. It's a part of your belief system and I would be an asshole to get mad at you for doing something you believe is right.  I still celebrate Christmas, but it's definitely more of a social thing than a religious thing, and I still send my youth pastors Christmas cards because they taught me to always be accepting of anyone and when I left the church, they tried so hard to see my side of it and why I could no longer believe in God.  What I guess I'm saying, is that what you're doing is nice, and if anyone gets mad at you for it, don't feel bad because they're being an asshole."
trashy,3dvbi0,chickenfarmlord,10,Mon Jul 20 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"I never say ""I'll pray for you"" condescendingly or not, because I recognize people have their own beliefs and even religious people may not appreciate me praying to my god for them. My go-to answer to someone's troubles is ""Is there anything I can do?"" (said seriously, I once babysat a near-stranger's two kids for a weekend because her elderly father fell in another state and she couldn't afford three plane tickets, I couldn't either but I could watch the kids.) and if there isn't I go to ""Well, may I pray for you?"" but for atheists I try to remember to say ""Well, you're in my thoughts, I hope things get better."" I may privately pray for atheist friends, but if they don't want me to, I don't because it seems rude to talk behind their back. (Yes I know I'm crazy. But I was raised not to talk about people to other people if the person being spoken of hasn't okayed it, and prayer is speaking to someone.)  I invite my atheists to holidays. We don't get preachy or overly religious and if they want to come exchange gifts, eat my food and if applicable, hunt eggs, then I want them there to do so. (and 3 out of 4 do, one will even agree to saying grace if he is visiting a house with small kids who say grace. He just bows his head and smiles, not sure if he says amen, because I honestly don't pay attention to who does or doesn't.)  I'm beginning to think Miss 1 out of 4 is indeed an asshole. She's family and I've done everything I can to be understanding and sweet to her and nothing is ever right. I tend to think its me but I might be her.   I will resist the urge to find the most sickeningly ""Jesus is the reason for the season"" Christmas card I can to send to her this year but otherwise I think I'm gonna just say fuck it and not worry about it. Maybe I'll even save the stamp and not send her a card. And I fucking love holiday cards, I pick out a tasteful design (I like Madonna and child scenes, and anything with the full holy family is nice because I'm big on the idea that Christmas is for celebrating the family, not the death, of Christ. Also for giving each other presents and eating because hell yes. But as I said, I do try to send less religious cards to athiests. I sent the holy family one to one of them last year though, because the card was beautiful and I knew he would love the art even if he isn't religious.)  I'm a southern woman, and I was raised exactly the way that phrase suggests. Hold my temper, cook for people going through crisis, help whenever I can and be kind above all. (And if everything is going to shit around someone, take them an easily frozen homemade meal and offer to do a bit of cleaning for them to take some strain off. But if they are vegan, Jewish or Muslim, make it a veggie curry because if doesn't have an animal products in it.)"

trashy,3dvbi0,Shipload,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:43:58 2015 UTC,""" is for celebrating the family, not the death, of Christ.""  You have Christmas confused with Easter, and even then, Easter isn't about celebrating not death but resurrection...."
trashy,3dvbi0,XOP23,2,Mon Jul 20 08:17:21 2015 UTC,"No, not confused. I'm saying Christmas is NOT for celebrating the death. Its for celebrating the family, both Christ's family and my own.  Easter is for celebrating the resurrection and subsequent salvation of mankind. And devilled eggs, because if I think hard enough I can link that to Christianity. But mostly because my cousins love them so I buy eight dozen eggs and devil the whole lot of them."

If you're dating someone, and have a sexual relationship with them, is it really that rude to ask about their porn habits? It is rude to judge someone over it, but... I dunno. Couples tend to want to get to know eachother, and usually a good way to do that is to find out the things they enjoy. So, if someone were really into porn, why not try to bring it up, have conversations about what they like and why? I've seen the porn my partner is into, and while it wasn't exactly my thing, I wouldn't stop him from enjoying it or hold it against him in any way....  I would've been miffed if he'd told me he didn't watch any at all, then find out later that he does. Lying equals distrust, and that's no way to have a healthy relationship."

trashy,3dvlq3,Sansasloane,6,Mon Jul 20 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"You should understand that it wasn't because he watched porn that you had no sex life. There was an external catalyst that caused him to prefer porn over sex with you, and that is what drove the wedge in your relationship. Porn was a symptom and it will always be one."
trashy,3dvlq3,iruleatants,4,Mon Jul 20 21:15:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. However, the difference is that it's not the actual porn that is CAUSING the problem. I was addicted to masturbation and porn too, but porn can be used the same way as alcohol to fuel addiction. And unfortunately sex/porn/masturbation addiction is one of the hardest to break b/c it taps right into the pleasure center of the brain. The underlying cause to all addiction is shame, and a shame-based life which just like any addiction you need help with. Addiction is just the physical manifestation to the deeper problems. Personally, mine are rooted in childhood and used porn to feel in control and to detach from my own feelings and from my very real hurt. People who have never been through it will never understand."
trashy,3dvlq3,zamardii12,5,Mon Jul 20 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"Well I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but it sounds like you had other issues as well.  Maybe he was just blaming the porn because it's easier than dealing with the truth?"
trashy,3dvlq3,AccusationsGW,2,Mon Jul 20 23:52:38 2015 UTC,Yeah that wasn't stemming from some other problem(s) in your relationship it had to be porn addiction....

trashy,3dvlq3,aegbeater,7,Sun Jul 19 22:34:34 2015 UTC,Sadly that's the truth. As girls we are taught it's not okay to touch ourselves and that porn is very bad. My mom gave me many books on how not to masterbate because she caught me once when I was young. It's tough to overcome and realize that it's okay to like porn and masterbate and that's it natural. But some women have it set in stone and I feel bad for them because they're really missing out. Sex in America is taboo.

trashy,3dvlq3,MythoughtLurksNoMore,3,Tue Jul 21 05:48:35 2015 UTC,"Setting rules for your partner is absolutely going to lead to lying. If you're not compatible and you're unwilling to compromise break up, don't dictate the behavior of another adult.  My husband watches tacky porn sometimes and so it's a little gross to encounter. He isnt rude about it so I don't encounter it as I go about my day and I don't look for it or invade his privacy. It's not that hard.  On another note, I feel like women who resent porn may not realize how often their so masturbates. I'm in for once or twice a day but my husband is closer to five so...hell no.

The woman said Tabora told her she could have the job if she could get 20 people to show up at the bar that night, or else she would have to perform a sexual act on Gandolfo. Police said the woman agreed.  The victim told police when she arrived at the bar it was closed and only four people were inside, so Tabora told her she'd lost the bet. The victim agreed to ""own up"" to her end of the deal and went into the bathroom with Gandolfo in exchange for getting the job. The victim said while it was happening she saw Tabora filming her with his cell phone, and she demanded he delete the recording before she left the bar.""  So she did it to get a job.

He was quite hopeful that lots of chicks would want to join him in it.  What an attractive paradise - immersing yourself in some untreated water that's been sitting there all weekend with who knows how many dirty people dipping themselves in it!

trashy,3dos8p,Oh_nosferatu,4,Sat Jul 18 19:23:32 2015 UTC,"She went to a school for the deaf and married my father young.  I should also clarify:  she wasn't completely illiterate, she just couldn't read very much.  She was stuck at maybe a second or third grade reading comprehension.  Also, once you lose/lack one of your senses, the rest of your body learns to adapt pretty quickly.  What /u/willwork4butterbeer is saying isn't that far off.  ASL is about getting your point across, not details.  So when translated, oftentimes deaf people sound grammatically incorrect."
