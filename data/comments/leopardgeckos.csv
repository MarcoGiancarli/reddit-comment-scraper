leopardgeckos,3e0wlk,Kat1yn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"No, you wont have to force feed. Beardies can't have just mealworms because they also need veggies, right? Leos are insectivores, so that is not really an issue. It is good to give leos variety in their diet,  but many breeders keep their leos on mealworms as a staple, without any issues.   Besides, some leos just have period where they're picky. Mine was on just crickets, to mealworms, and now back on crickets. Just keep offering crickets every now and then, and he might get interested at some point."

A good rule is that the size of the cricket should be the same length as the distance between your gecko's two eyes.  If the meal is too big or too small, the gecko will have a natural disinterest."

leopardgeckos,3dz033,redbox03,3,Mon Jul 20 18:01:19 2015 UTC,You should be able to use heat tape no problem. You'll have to cut slits in the side so you can thread the heat tape through and along the back on the enclosure. Just have the clips on the opposite side where the heat tape comes out of the slit. The heat tape shouldn't get to hot(over 100f) if it burns the wood then it'd def be to hot for you're geckos anyways. Just keep them all on one thermostat. Then you can lay tiles over the heat tape and it should conduct the heat well.

leopardgeckos,3dwpy4,Van_Juarez,2,Mon Jul 20 07:47:12 2015 UTC,Oh okay! What is a morph?
leopardgeckos,3dwpy4,Summer_Frost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"Basically, a morph is a trait that is passed down from the parents to the babies. It can be either a line-bred trait or a genetic trait. Line-bred traits are when a breeder sees a uncommon trait like a high amount of lavender in some of their geckos, then pairs two leos that exhibit that trait and selectively breed the next few generations to get the trait they want. An example would be a Tangerine Carrot-tail. Genetic traits are carried over to the babies in the chromosomes given from each parent. Some geckos can also be carriers for a morph but not actually show it, this happens when a Recessive morph  (such as a Tremper Albino) breeds with a normal, causing the babies to have one normal gene and one albino but will only show the normal type gene since it is the dominant one. This would be called heterozygous,  and if they bred to another Tremper albino, half the babies would be Het for albino still, but the other half would get one albino gene from the full albino and another from the Het albino, making them into albinos. There's more, but that's basically about the jist of it."
leopardgeckos,3dwpy4,demial,2,Mon Jul 20 17:41:34 2015 UTC,"To expand a bit in relation to your girl, OP: a ""normal"" is also referred to as wild type, which essentially means she looks like a normal Leo you'd find in the wild (hence the two names) as opposed to having a morph someone bred for. There's a ton of diversity even within wild types though! I also have a wild type and he's got a lot of lavender in him as opposed to the charcoal in your leo. They're fascinating little creatures :)"

leopardgeckos,3do60f,QueenGeraldina,4,Fri Jul 17 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"Looks comfy! And cool!   If I leave a cup or bowl or plate on my desk when my Leo is out she makes a bee line to get on/in them. I don't know why she wants to be in a food container, but this is a very desirable place to be. If I'm holding her and she sees it she'll try to cloud walk* to it. (*walk where there is nothing there as she's learned if I'm paying attention platforms (my hands) appear where she wants to go.) And if I DON'T let her go on the plate then I'm obviously just being mean and she'll tell me off in lizard grumbles. She's really vocal about what she wants and how she feels about things. I don't know if other people's leos are too?  Maybe she wants to be in plates and bowls so much because she sees me getting SOMETHING desirable out of it?  If I'm home she comes out and watches me most of the time and I wonder what odd conclusions she has come to about daily human activity. Or maybe it is ceramic, smooth, and cool so it feels good. Or maybe because I encourage her to explore, and about every week or so I will put a thing in her vivarium to explore (as spending your entire life looking at the same four walls gets terribly dull). And she sees this new thing that isn't usually there and is like ""NEW THING! EXPLORE!"" Or maybe she wants to be in them because when she sees me eating out of it she has some weird association with it that either her being in it will get her attention. She LOVES attention and will intentionally act like she's going to fall or having difficulty crossing something which when she thinks I am not looking she'll cross no problem. I've seen her feign struggling and look up at me and I PRETENDED I didn't see (hand to the side ready to swoop under if she fell) and when she realized I wasn't looking she scooted to an easier to cross area and was just fine. She intentionally feigns needing help when she thinks she's not getting enough attention, and if that's not smart I don't know what is. She also really likes tummy rubs which I hear is unusual for leos, but heaven help you if you touch anything else but her tummy. (I ask her if she wants a tummy rub and 75% of the time she'll stand up and I'll gently rub down her tummy and she'll look pleased- unless you accidentally touch her leg or back or ANYTHING else, then she'll jump in surprise and give you a dirty look, or walk away because that's just over the line I guess."

leopardgeckos,3do60f,barrerd1,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"Have you tried making a designated toilet? Most informational sites/books say they like corners, but leave out that MANY leos like to do their business in hides. Mine use to go in wet hide, which was a problem. So I gave her two wet hides, and she chose one to always do her business in. Eventually I let that wet hide dry and turned it into a potty hide and now she only potties in there. Unless she's mad at me. She is an emotional little thing and like many pets is limited to showing her displeasure in inappropriate poo places and destruction.   So yeah, try giving them a second wet hide that looks DIFFERENT than the first one and hopefully you can get them to designate it as a toilet. If they go in the wrong place put it in the potty hide and that helps them learn it should go in there."

Has all the basic care and some info on the species as well :) 20gal long is a good size. I'd avoid tank mates, males will pester females and start fights if they don't want to breed and most adult females don't get along. The only exception I've really seen is females raised together, but unless you get them from a breeder who temp sexs you'll be taking a slight risk of them not both beig females."

Also makes me feel a little less worried when I sell them that they're going to be taken care of correctly. Not knowing what's going to happen to them has almost scared me out of breeding a few times
leopardgeckos,3do7m2,Bababou,2,Mon Jul 20 12:12:32 2015 UTC,"Best bet is to take a look over to the right at the links.  Tons and tons of pages to read through and get most of your general questions out of the way.  A 20 long is a great tank size for 1 or 2 geckos, mealworms are the most common food staple. No sand EVER its not worth the risk.  A few hides across the length of the tank. From there its up to you."
leopardgeckos,3do7m2,Bababou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:57:45 2015 UTC,Awesome! Would two geckos in one tank be pushing it or not that big of a deal? And would coconut fiber be a good substrate
leopardgeckos,3do7m2,XPostLinker,2,Sat Jul 18 08:02:12 2015 UTC,Coconut fiber is great for a humid hide but not as a general substrate.  As you read the links that will be pointed out.  Please read through the links it will be the best way to figure out the safest way to set up your tank and get to know about the animal.  Far more information will be picked up from reading the care sheets and how to's then just asking a question that is answered in detail with explanations and alternates. You will be a better gecko owner for it.
leopardgeckos,3dmoio,SifNoMansLand,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"My biggest concern with dividing a tank is the heating gradient it would cause. Even with properly distributed uth's it would still create a strange gradient that the current geckos aren't used to, not to mention the change in space. Also the possibility of whatever divider you use being knocked down and hurting one of the geckos.  All in all i'd say the risk is not worth stressing your geckos or possibly endangering them. Get another tank imho."

leopardgeckos,3dkxr6,sensibletruth,0,Fri Jul 17 04:22:34 2015 UTC,I have had eggs however when they were laid they didn't have a damp area so they became infertile my bigger question was that part of mating or were they actually fighting?

leopardgeckos,3dkxr6,trustthapo,2,Fri Jul 17 04:29:39 2015 UTC,"Leos aren't social animals, sadly. They could have been fighting from the pressure of sharing an aquarium. Maybe your male tried to breed the female and she fought back. Males have shown different behavior patterns before attempting to breed, such as tail wagging, etc. You might even want to put in an opaque divider. My female could see my male from her cage and she'd get all fired up at him."

My Home Depot is small and didn't offer a tile cutting service, but I think larger ones still do. I highly recommend getting the tiles cut instead of doing what I did unless you are very artistic.  Because I couldn't get the tiles cut (no experience or my own tools to do so) I decided to try and emulate a Redditor who said s/he broke up the tiles using a rubber mallet and put them in the tank mosaic-style, cushioning them with a layer of sand to fill in the space between tiles. The picture they posted looked so beautiful!  Mine does not look very beautiful. It took a VERY long time to get the tile pieces to fit nicely in the tank without leaving too much space for sand. I thought this would be a simple project and it turned into a Cold War between my mother and I :P   Tl;Dr: unless you really like artsy DIY, get the tile cut professionally. Also, use slate tiles!"

They're hardy little guys (: I just put them in their plastic travel containers with paper towels (on the bottom and one loosely in there they could use to hide under). Don't feed him the day of, because if he gets stressed he'll throw it up anyway. Just make sure you secure his travel container somehow, like by nestling it in the middle of some sheets or towels. Just so he doesn't shake around too much."

The only thing I added differently was making a hiding place by wedging a cardboard piece at one end for cover. I also filled that area's edge with a soft substance just in case I had to slam my brakes.

I keep the two of them in a plastic travel case when I do so however it's a short ride (10-15 min). Since the tank is already set up at your destination, I would imagine it is best to go straight through and get him there and in the tank rather than having him without a tank overnight. The main thing I make sure to do when transporting mine is making sure they are in between things in the car so the case is a bit snug and therefore doesn't move around."

The reason yu find calcium without d3 is the UVB lights supply it. But if you don't have a UVB light and you don't use calcium with d3 then they have no where to acquire the d3 then they'll have trouble proceSing the calcium. So stick with the d3"
leopardgeckos,3dc6dr,japamelos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:34:45 2015 UTC,Calcium without D3 is only used for animals that are consistently exposed to natural sunlight. UVB bulbs don't negate the need for it.
leopardgeckos,3dc6dr,Herherpsnderps,2,Wed Jul 15 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"Reptiles that's manufactur their own d3 when exposed to the sun also use the UVB light in the same way. Some animals can't even process the d3 in calcium and that's why they require the UVB instead. Just depends on their process of squire the d3. Leopards can just consume in. But there are species in which even if you put d3 in the calcium but without the UVB light they'll still suffer. There's a really good article on it. One of the thin a I love about reptiles, the variability in their adaptions is so neat"

leopardgeckos,3dc6dr,japamelos,2,Wed Jul 15 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, I know it's bit different with beardies. I usually cut my beardies calcium with d3 with pure calcium as well as multivitamins. I think the major factor of how they process is whether active during the day vs active at night."

leopardgeckos,3dc6dr,japamelos,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"Hornworms are the best way to put weight on any insectivore imo. Lots of good stuff in those guys, just make sure they aren't too big so they don't choke on it.   The best diet is a varied diet. Mealworms are a good source of protein, especially for geckos (but also for beardies, until they're big enough for superworms). Just give her as many different insects as possible and see what she likes. Leos can be quite picky."
leopardgeckos,3dc6dr,sensibletruth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:07:54 2015 UTC,Mealworms are really only safe for adult beardies but even then there's really too much chitin on them for beardies to digest. I'm guessing leos must be able to digest chitin better? Because I see that as a staple everywhere I look. My first reaction was hesitation because most people who own beardies know not to feed them mealworms so I wasn't sure if it was misinformation or actually legit. If it's actually legit then that's great.
leopardgeckos,3dc6dr,sensibletruth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:18:10 2015 UTC,"I have never seen an adult bearded dragon interested in mealworms. They're too small. Which is why younger ones have mealworms and older ones have superworms.   Reptiles can't digest chitin, including leopard geckos. Leopard geckos have an easier time passing it through their bodies, which makes it a good staple food for them.  But like I wrote before, the best diet for any animal is a varied diet. Humans can't digest the outside of corn because of the same reasons reptiles can't digest chitin. If you ate corn for every single meal, you would definitely have some digestive issues. So you don't eat corn all the time, you eat tons of other foods. But does that mean having some corn every once in while has no positive effects? No. Corn is good for you every once in a while. Just like mealworms or superworms are good for bearded dragons."

leopardgeckos,3d4y04,leoaway,2,Mon Jul 13 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"Size-wise it'd be fine.  The bottom looks like flat glass that rests flush, so you'd need to attach some tall feet to fit an under tank heater (which you do need) beneath it.  Not ideal, but it would do.

leopardgeckos,3d4y04,kspdrgn,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:34 2015 UTC,I personally dislike the swinging doors for the low models because the front panel is already small from the low height and the latches and hinges from the door obscure the view from the front. IMO the design suits the tall arboreal terrariums better.  I hadn't considered the space for UTH. I could always get adhesive furniture foot pads to raise the terrarium to fit it.

From what I have read you don't want to hand feed as they don't bother to learn to hunt if you do to much. They are well worth the effort to keep in my opinion and you found your way to a good group to help you out. Just please read as much as you can before buying one to give it the best chance you can to a healthy life.

But, in my experience a MAJOR change in environment causes my gecko to be reluctant to eat or leave its hide for about...2 days.   Afterwhich it returns to normal behavior. I haven't done a lot of research into impaction caused by sand, which I am assuming is the reason you changed your substrate from sand to paper towels?  I have seen one or two online sites about forcefeeding the gecko with 2-3 mealworms a day, but what is your setup like? I noticed a large change in behavior from my gecko when I moved it from a small 10 gallon to a 29 gallon enclosure, and while I don't know everything, I would be glad to offer advice!"
leopardgeckos,3cw00q,halflifeguy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:27:38 2015 UTC,"All I did was take out my sand, which she had been laying on for about seven or eight years, and replaced it with paper towels, now she doesn't even budge at the sight of a cricket, she is really skinny and I am very concerned. I gave her a bath and massaged her stomach but nothing came out, she has a dark purple spot underneath her left rib cage, I'm not sure if that's impactation or just one of her organs showing because she is too skinny. I tried feeding her mealworms today, even trying to put one in her mouth, but she spit it right out. She just recently shed also. I am very concerned that this might be my last few days with her."
leopardgeckos,3cw00q,halflifeguy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:31:40 2015 UTC,"Well a lot of the impaction worries, from what I have found stem from younger geckos who are more likely to swallow sand and small particles.   The dark purple spot could be an organ or could be something more sinister, but I don't know enough about gecko physiology to comment.  I know that Male leo's can live for 15+ years but it seems that females tend to max out about 10 years, and it is possible that this is simply an effect of time...sad as it is =/  I am sure no one here would recommend it, but perhaps calcium dust some meal worms, chop them up into small pieces, small enough to swallow...and get your gecko to eat them, perhaps not allowing it to spit them out.  The shedding, of course, causes stress on the animal, and mine is reluctant to eat during a shed, but it seems like you have housed these animals far longer than I and should know more then me :)   Was she skinny before you removed the sand? Also, If you could post some pictures of the spot...I don't pretend to understand a geckos body 100%, but I have an interest in physiology and biology and I am sure through some of my text books and maybe some googling, I could figure out a rough guess as to what that spot is.

I would also recommend an under tank heater if you do not have one.  Geckos tend to like closed spaces, and your tank feels very ""open"" perhaps get some large stones and bark from outside, bake it in the oven to kill any bacteria, cool it down and put it into the tank? If the animal feels exposed, its gonna hide/be reluctant to eat.  What are the temps at on either side?"

leopardgeckos,3cuxos,mcbrybry,2,Sat Jul 11 00:11:02 2015 UTC,"While not related to OP, I have to say, I REALLY like the look of your substrate. Very natural. What did you use?"
leopardgeckos,3cuxos,sassybluewhale,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:22:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's exactly what I was going for with this setup! Everything is designed to be both functional and visually appealing. I used slate tile from Home Depot for the substrate, with a thin layer of sand to keep them from slipping or scratching the tank. I used a rubber mallet to break the large tiles into smaller, more natural looking pieces and then pieced them together like a mosaic. The whole thing was easy and cheap to do. I got two tiles for under 4$, and I had a bag of sand on hand already."
leopardgeckos,3cuxos,mcbrybry,2,Sat Jul 11 00:27:30 2015 UTC,I don't know why breaking them up never occurred to me! I might follow your example because I'm a big fan of it lol.

I have seen geckos not eat one night after significant changes to their enclosure simply because they haven't found where the food is yet. To encourage her finding the mealworms I would 1. always put them in the same spot 2. Put a lot more than 5 in the bowl 3. Not dust them so they live longer and are more active, and 4. stop feeding crickets in order to establish the mealworms.  Take a look at your cap too and make sure the gecko can actually maneuver her head into it to reach the worms."

leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,halflifeguy,4,Fri Jul 10 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Oke let me start by saying her temps are not fine! seeing as she is difficult with eating I would almost guarantee it without even seeing the animal or the terrarium as this is the case in 90% of gecko's who stop eating or are difficult eaters  In one comment you say you don't know her temps and in another you say they are fine. You seem very stubborn in believing it couldn't possibly be her temps. If you don't want to follow up any answer given then don't ask questions here.  You're gecko is suffering and possibly dying because you are to lazy to get a 8 buck thermometer to make absolutely 100% sure what her temps are.   Anyway, You're gecko is showing the exact same behavior and eating problems as one my gecko's did. Thankfully I did the right thing and changed from a analogue thermometer to a digital one and found out her temps were on the low side. I upped her temperatures and she started eating like crazy again that same night.   Reptiles are very straightforward but time consuming animals to take care of. If you don't want to put in the effort to check the basics, then don't keep reptiles."
leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,Akaria_nl,2,Sat Jul 11 08:00:30 2015 UTC,"Hello, today I turned her heating pad up, and after a few minutes she started eating mealworms like crazy, I am buying a thermometer and wax worms on Tuesday."
leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"Remember you want a 75 cool side and 90 hot side(do not exceed over 95f or she'll stop eating from heat stress). Try and get that thermometetr I linked you in the other comment, the dial ones are terrible, I've seen them be off an entire 20degrees, and if you're using a uth it only warms the floor, so taking the air temp is irrelevant."
leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,Herherpsnderps,3,Sun Jul 12 22:22:00 2015 UTC,What're her temp at?
leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,Herherpsnderps,0,Fri Jul 10 10:36:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure, But it's been about the same her entire life, It's probably a little warmer because I switched from sand to paper towels, and the heating pad is now in her cage with her."
leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,Sweetsmyle,4,Fri Jul 10 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"You need to know the temps. When the temps aren't right they can refuse to eat due to heat stress. Also if it's to cold they can digest so thy just starve, or when they do eat it rots in their gut. You cannot own a cold blooded animal and not know they're temperatures. 5 degrees is a huge deal to them. Get get this thermometer. You can check the temp of the cool side, floor and hot side(all of which you need to know). Cold blooded creatures rely on their environmental temperatures to do basic metabolic processes."
leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,queenmamabee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:50:10 2015 UTC,"Has she always been on the thin side? You might want to try something a bit fattier like wax worms. Not as a regular thing but every few days at least until she bulks up a bit. Also they are like candy to leopards so that will tell you if she is just being picky or if something is wrong. If she does not eat those then take her to the vet. Mine are slightly picky eaters, one prefers meal worms and the other likes crickets so I switch between the two to give them a little variety. However, wax worms are never refused by either."
leopardgeckos,3cqt1t,queenmamabee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:17:53 2015 UTC,"When did you change her habitat? I feed my gecko as many crickets as he'll eat within 10ish minutes. It varies from gecko to gecko...but mine will devour a good 10 crickets, sometimes more. If you just recently changed her habitat, give her time to get used to it. If it's been awhile, might be worth taking her to the vet.   Next feeding, maybe try giving her  more than the average number of crickets, and let her gobble up as much as she'll eat. If there are any left over after around 10-15  minutes, take em out. Are you dusting the crickets?"

I intend to buy at the next local expo but if I can't find anything there, I'll definitely be buying from GeckoBoa.  I've heard good things about Reptiles by Mack and they're fairly cheap as well.

leopardgeckos,3coskh,Summer_Frost,3,Thu Jul 9 15:53:30 2015 UTC,"Es can have a range of how it can effect geckos. It can happen at any point of their life(4 year old can suddenly get symptoms). They can range from star gazing and having a balance issue to not being able to walk and basically doing a crocodile death roll until they starve. But then there are some that show no symptoms. One of the reasons breeders don't broadcast this as much is because it's a shiny new morph that's worth a lot and relatively easy to work into any project you already have. Also many don't keep their breeders their entire life or even more than a year or two, they the gecko may not get this issue with them. But it's so new and there's just not enough research to find out why it's happen or what it related to.  The geckos are beautiful(I was so tempted to get this gorgeous dreamsicle I saw cheap) but I can't bring myself to breed them with the risks. Seems like the propel that are really breedin them are a bit more concerned with the price while many others are trying to figure out what's wrong with them. Personally I think they're gorgeous but proper reasEarch should be done before flooding the market and screwing up the captive bred population with bad genes. Hopefully down the road when the morph is better understood we can figure out how to get rid of the negative side effects of the morph"
leopardgeckos,3coskh,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:59:31 2015 UTC,"Those symptoms definitely sound serious, especially since it's hard to tell which geckos will be affected.  Do you know of any breeders or other individuals who are ""studying"" ES, so to speak? I'm a psych/neuro major so I'd be interested in speaking with people attempting to figure it out.  I agree on how lovely they are! I'm a sucker for geckos with a lot of white and orange and the enigma gene does some really cool things in that realm. But I agree that it's a poor choice to breed a population that's prone to such a bad condition.   Do you know if combining the enigma trait with other genes tends to reduce the ES symptoms? Or is a mixed enigma just as likely to get ES and with the same severity?"
leopardgeckos,3coskh,Herherpsnderps,2,Sun Jul 12 13:06:04 2015 UTC,"I can't find all the articles I read, it's been over a year since I looked into it.

leopardgeckos,3coskh,Bababou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that article! I did end up contacting the author and while he isn't doing strictly scientific method - based research he has a degree in neuroscience and is still breeding the morph, so he had some insights.  Breeding enigma x enigma leads to intense symptoms that onset sooner, whereas out crosses are much more viable. Despite careful breeding he's been unable to eliminate ES from his gene pool, but symptoms in the offspring are reduced to minor balance issues and things like that (no fatalities that he reported).  I was interested to know if geckos with mild ES had a reduced life expectancy but he hasn't raised any for long enough to know."

leopardgeckos,3clz1y,hamsquidd,2,Thu Jul 9 02:16:01 2015 UTC,That's strange because I bought about 30 crickets from the pet store and they are all suddenly dead too.

leopardgeckos,3clz1y,tanoren,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't feed em to your gecko. I ordered 1,100 mealworms online and in a few weeks all but maybe ten died. The ten that lived I fed to Freyja and he had diarrhea  for a few days. He's all better now but it was scary. Not doing that again. The sad thing is I ordered them online to save money since my local pet store raised the price on mealworms. It's now like $5 for 100 and that only lasts me a few weeks. The 1,100 were around $12."

leopardgeckos,3ckfdp,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for clarifying.   Since they're so high in calcium does that mean I should limit how many my leo eats or does it not matter?  How about replacing crickets with calci worms?

leopardgeckos,3ckfdp,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:19:40 2015 UTC,"Nope, you could feed just Phoenix worms and be fine.

D3 is needed though and getting poisoned by it is difficult and takes such a large amount it just doesn't really happen"
leopardgeckos,3ckfdp,Aberwitzig,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"Calci worms are great! Everyone else has already listed the benefits so I'll throw in one small warning if you do decide to feed them. If your gecko tends to gulp things down without chewing, he might actually pass the worms undigested and still alive. It freaked me out the first time I saw it, but a way to fix it is to poke the worms with a sterilized sewing needle before feeding. That way, your gecko's digestive juices have a way to get inside the worm and start breaking it down.  But yeah, they're easy to keep, don't make noise, can't bite or escape, and are far superior in calcium content and general nutrition to pretty much any feeder out there. I wouldn't feed them as a staple, though, more like a ""vitamin pill"" for variety.  Also, they have significantly less fat than waxworms"
leopardgeckos,3ckfdp,Aberwitzig,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"First off, that's a really interesting image. Thanks a lot. Thankfully he's not too much of a fast eater, he usually spends a fair amount of time crushing things up in his mouth. Even wax worms & small dubias.   Do you need to gutload calci worms? I know you don't need to do so for wax worms but I guess they're obviously not the same. How many do you feed your leo, roughly?  I posted this above but I'd like your input too. Would replacing crickets with calci worms be okay? Right now his diet is about 75% roaches, 25% crickets, and the occasional wax worm."
leopardgeckos,3ckfdp,munchidk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about them is that you actually don't need to gutload them or even dust them since they already have pretty naturally-occurring high nutrition levels. The site I buy mine from actually tells you not to feed them because it will cause them to poop, foul up their media, and then attract bacteria and fungus which will infect and ultimately kill them. Makes it way easier to keep them because you just put their cup somewhere cool (they like temps around 50 degrees) and forget about them.  My leo is kind of a special case since he's a rescue with some obvious MBD-related issues so I feed him on a juvie schedule even though he's the age of an adult (he's only 25 grams). He eats primarily dubia roaches and I alternate between 3 per day and no calci worms and 2 per day with 2 calci worms. I'll cut him back to 3x a week once he reaches a healthy weight but I'll still alternate the feedings the same way.  If you want to totally get rid of crickets (and I don't blame you, those things are disgusting) then I think calci worms would be a great supplement to the roaches. You might want to change your proportions a little bit to something like 80% roaches / 20% calci worms just to make sure you aren't overdoing it. They're more like a vitamin pill than a solid meal."
leopardgeckos,3ckfdp,Etsecla,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome, sounds good. Thanks again.  I'll probably pick them up and see what my leo makes of them. If he's interested then I'll make them part of his regular diet. :)"

leopardgeckos,3c9vul,Bababou,3,Mon Jul 6 07:09:04 2015 UTC,You can get a timer for the heat lamp. Geckos like belly heat more than any other form of heat so leave the UTH on all the time.

leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,mrcattherevenger,5,Sun Jul 5 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"Everyone will tell you, so I might as well mention: sand is not a proper substrate for leos, assuming this photo is after you brought her home. Go for paper towels-cheaper and much safer!"
leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,collypin,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"She was kept on sand at the shop, the keeper said she should be alright because she's used to it. I thought this was exceptible as I have read before (on some caresheets, and from some redditors) that it is alright for older geckos. She's a little over a year old.  Is this correct or am I misinformed?"
leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,Herherpsnderps,4,Sun Jul 5 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, sand is bad for them no matter the age. They come from an arid desert, which is all rock and hard packed dirt, not sand. So not only is it always a risk of impaction as they're digestive tract can pass it well. But there's also the other main issue which is it dries their feet out(picture how yor feet feel after a day at the beach, ick!) they don't have the proper hard played feet of a reptile from a sandy desert. This creates shedding issues and many times they will lose toes to bad sheds as well. Tile is a much better substitute, even paper towel is good. To be honest most pet shops are ignorant as all hell when it comes to reptiles. I have a care sheet I created for the people i sell to at expos if you want one."
leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,Herherpsnderps,5,Sun Jul 5 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I will look to change out the sand for paper towels as soon as possible, and then tile in the near future.   I would love to take a caresheet, have you got a digital version?"
leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,free_at_dawn,2,Sun Jul 5 19:32:23 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I use paper towel for my rack but my hair and kept one of my ex breeders so we keep him on tile and I prefer that.

leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,free_at_dawn,-2,Mon Jul 6 06:08:05 2015 UTC,"I have kept mine in part sand part tile for years and my Leo loves/prefers it over any other substrate that I have tried. Don't let others sway you with impaction scare tactics, as long as you keep a keen eye on your Leo and knows it's habits/routines, your Leo will be fine."
leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,BenzieBox,3,Sun Jul 5 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"I'm being open minded about all options, I went through the same desicion when choosing the substrate for my bearded dragon. I chose sand and have had no problems at all!  As for my gecko, I'm gonna go with tile. I feel it's better to be safe than sorry. It's a better decision for a smaller animal.  Thanks for sharing your opinion though!"
leopardgeckos,3c7ewn,free_at_dawn,3,Sun Jul 5 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"This is only true is you do not feed your leo inside the enclosure. Impaction isn't rare and can happen at any age, anytime, even with previous success. Even if it never happens in your animal's lifetime, why risk the health of other animals for aesthetics? IMO, not worth it."

There's nothing anyone online can do, maybe contact a local reptile store and see who they use as a vet? There's no home remedy, it could be anything, even an issue with his spine, perhaps an infection. I hear kids in the background, is there any way one of them may have taken him out unsupervised and accidentally dropped him?"

So, it may very well be that he did fall and went into shock. From you video, I don't see a broken spine but have you checked his stomach? Does it look like it has some internal bleeding?   Many people say that it could just be the shock of falling down and he'll be normal in 1-2 days. Let's hope he pulls through it.

leopardgeckos,3c1ivd,rbroccoli,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:16:58 2015 UTC,I had my male Leo go through a bad shed where he wouldn't shed around his eyes and vent. I'd help remove the skin (be super careful that you aren't pulling it off too early!) but if I didn't get it all he'd shed again within a week. Be sure she's completely shedding. Does she have a humid hide?
leopardgeckos,3c1ivd,trustthapo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:52:39 2015 UTC,"She has a humid hide, and she is completely shedding. I check her after each time if I don't watch her go completely through it. (It's easy to tell, she's quite vibrant)"

leopardgeckos,3c1ivd,trustthapo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it's nothing major. I was wondering if it's hydration. Her Urate has been smaller lately, which has to do with hydration, so I assume that can affect dryness of her skin"
leopardgeckos,3bzkeo,OhWhatsHisName,2,Fri Jul 3 12:41:06 2015 UTC,It should probably fall off on its own eventually. If it's still there in a few days you can try pulling it off gently.
leopardgeckos,3bzkeo,shootsmcgavins,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:28:13 2015 UTC,"it'll just fall off on it's own, just keep off any loose substrate and keep it clean and he should be fine"
leopardgeckos,3bzkeo,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:56:08 2015 UTC,If the toe is dead and dry it most likely will not become infected. I rehabilitated a male gecko years ago who had lost pretty much every toe. When I got him the toes just sort of dropped off. No infections or anything. If you are worried just make sure the enclosure is nice and clean.

leopardgeckos,3bwpla,sgntpepper03,2,Thu Jul 2 20:37:02 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. Even seeing the little head I still cannot fathom how they fit their tiny lil bodies in those eggs!
leopardgeckos,3bwpla,BenzieBox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:15:34 2015 UTC,Always amazes me how they fit in those tiny things. I have one female who lays quite large eggs. Rest of them lay this size (which is normal).
leopardgeckos,3bwpla,demial,2,Thu Jul 2 20:48:43 2015 UTC,That must have been amazing! They look so small and soft.
leopardgeckos,3bxsz4,PacificNorthwest206,2,Fri Jul 3 01:14:10 2015 UTC,Fertile and they need humidity.  What substrate do you incubate in? What temp do you do that at? Are you looking for males or females?
leopardgeckos,3bxsz4,MaverickKira,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:42:19 2015 UTC,Update I candled the eggs and they seemed to have a red ring inside of them...(like so: https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-crtYJ19yTvE/UT0qm6pkD2I/AAAAAAAAAqM/qTkRO-0yXN4/w760-h428-o-k/100MEDIA%2524IMAG0678.jpg) what does this mean?

leopardgeckos,3bxsz4,Weaselpaw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:13:46 2015 UTC,Why do they look so scrunched up in my picture?
leopardgeckos,3bxsz4,AvidLebon,2,Fri Jul 3 07:31:37 2015 UTC,"If they were laid there in the enclosure and not in a moist lay box, then they are shriveled. You can put them in an incubation box with moist ecoearth or vermiculite and cover them to try and rehydrate them. Don't put water directly on the egg."
leopardgeckos,3bujbc,Prophetofhelix,3,Thu Jul 2 07:04:22 2015 UTC,"You probably don't need any source of overhead heat. We use under-tank heating for our leopards (one of those heat mats you get at the pet store--stick it underneath the tank). Make sure the heat pad only heats a part of the tank--your gecko will move around between hot and cold sides as needed to regulate his temp. Light can be necessary if your gecko is in a dark room--they need to have a diurnal light cycle. If his room is bright enough that you can read comfortably, he's probably ok without any extra light.  Leos do well with heat they can absorb through their belly (like a warm rock in the wild). The belly heat lets them soak up warmth and run their digestive system--it won't work if they're too cold. Once you've got a setup, read the temps on the cool side and the warm side. You want a 90 degree warm side, and a 75 degree cool side. You can add supplementary heating if you need it.  You're right to be concerned about misting. What your gecko needs is a humid hide. In the wild, the geckos will hide out in burrows underground or in rocky hides. These spaces are more humid than the ambient arid desert in which they live. The humid micro-climate helps them keep healthy skin and respiratory systems, and they can go outside to get some dry air.  We usually use a tupperware with a hole cut in it, but you can buy attractive hides at the pet store, too. Put some moss and/or coconut fiber (often sold as eco-earth at the pet store) in there, and mist it down every day or two.  Exo-terra tanks kick ass. They're pretty sturdy, and probably wouldn't be damaged by overhanging. They do have molded plastic ""feet"" though, so if half the feet are hanging off the edge, your tank might be a bit unstable, or sit at an angle. If you can't decide, you can usually find them on craigslist or something for short money. Be sure you get a ""wide"" one instead of ""tall"" one.  Here is an awesome caresheet you should read. It'll discuss everything you need to know."
leopardgeckos,3bujbc,boa249,2,Thu Jul 2 12:56:38 2015 UTC,"Hey there, so following yours and others advice, I ordered a UTH, a heat regulator and an infared thermometer from Amazon. I also moved my gecko into a 29 gallon tank, to allow for a larger temperature gradient. For now, I have the red light providing heat, but come sunday I'll use the UTH alone and get some temp readings, and see how they are with/without additional heating. Also, I purchased an exo-terra moist hide, I know I didn't need to spend the money but I like the way it looks haha"
leopardgeckos,3bujbc,kspdrgn,3,Fri Jul 3 05:37:21 2015 UTC,"One: No overhead heat or lights. Under Tank Heater covering about 1/3rd of the tank on one side, will provide heat gradients to allow the animal to regulate their own heat.  Two: Bowl of water always, they'll drink, you just won't witness it until months later. Also provide cheap tupperware moist hide as mentioned by boa249.  Three: My Exo-Terra hangs farther than that, it's fine.  Four: Get an infra-red thermometer, a cheap one from amazon. Do not trust stick-on thermometers. You only care about the floor surface temperature."

Also good call on the reptile carpet, another new mistake is to use a loose substrate. If you get sick of cleaning your carpet some day, try using tile.  If you notice your gecko isn't staying in the half-hide against the front, try sticking some partial concealment to the outside so he feels safe there."
leopardgeckos,3bujbc,blues4youze,2,Fri Jul 3 16:55:23 2015 UTC,Ceramic bulbs are not necessary for Leos. An under the tank heater and an infrared should provide enough heat. I have both and I use the infrared during the winter or when I have air conditioning on. The infrared I turn off at night just because they don't need as much heat at night. As for misting I don't know too many people who do that as long as you have a moist hide. I think my Leo gets all his moisture from that.

leopardgeckos,3br7ed,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"We usually keep his tank around 72-74F. Also I knew it! I always thought he was a boy but my sister took him to a reptile shop and they said he was a she! Well that's an interesting turn. It rules out that he might be passing an egg, which was one of our ideas.."
leopardgeckos,3br7ed,Herherpsnderps,5,Wed Jul 1 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"Wait, just 74 in the whole tank? They need a head grsdient, they need a minimum of 88f to digest, if they don't have that then they won't eat. If they eat and it's to cold to metabolize the food rota in the stomach. They need a 75 cool side and 90 hot side(do not exceed over 95).   That's all your problem is, improper temperatures. Cold blooded animals rely completely on their environmental temperature, we as mammals don't need to worry because we can produce our own heat. Honestly even if your vet doesn't do reptile often the basic setup of a widely kept reptile..they should've been able to help a bit."

leopardgeckos,3bq865,capsfanforever,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:00:17 2015 UTC,There is a really really faint v shape of dots. I thought it was female until I saw those then I wasn't sure.
leopardgeckos,3bq865,capsfanforever,2,Wed Jul 1 16:53:15 2015 UTC,"If the gecko is over a year old, the pores would be much more defined. As would the bulges. I'm 95% sure that's a female, though if it's still a juvenile there's no way to be sure except through dna tests."
leopardgeckos,3bq865,Sweetsmyle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! I guess I will just have to wait a bit longer when Scooter is older to find out for sure.
leopardgeckos,3bq865,MaverickKira,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"My females have tiny little pores too and I thought they were maybe male at first but the vet said nope female. Then at a reptile convention I say a mature male and yeah it is very apparent. If this were male you'd really be able to see the V without having to squint and guess. If this is a really really young gecko then it might be too early yet but I'm guessing female. How big is she (length, weight)?"
leopardgeckos,3boo6t,capsfanforever,5,Tue Jun 30 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"Cute, although I'd def get them off the sand. There's multiple reasons, it's not natural(their from an arid desert, all rock and hard packed dirt) it can cause impaction(more so in hatchlings) and it dries out their feet, making them lose toes to stuck sheds. If you're breeding it's def something you'll want to change."
leopardgeckos,3boo6t,Herherpsnderps,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:59:03 2015 UTC,"The adults like to dig sometimes, and I have never had a problem with impaction since I feed them mealworms in a dish. The baby doesn't live in the sand, it is segregated in the carrier you see in the background. I appreciate the tips though, it's always good to double check"
leopardgeckos,3boo6t,Herherpsnderps,5,Tue Jun 30 23:40:00 2015 UTC,"Well like I said, there's other reasons. If you've ever been to the beach after you want to wash your feet because the sand makes it so dry. Well leopards don't have those hard plated feet a reptile from a dandy desert would have. I'd just make them a dog box, although a dig box of Eco is better and doubles as a humid hide."
leopardgeckos,3boo6t,Herherpsnderps,2,Wed Jul 1 00:23:38 2015 UTC,What would you recommend as a substrate?
leopardgeckos,3boo6t,Herherpsnderps,2,Wed Jul 1 00:38:55 2015 UTC,Slate Tiles is about as close as you can get to their natural substrate without money or a lot of work. There's excavator clay but that's a bit of a task. But tile is also super easy to clean and looks really nice

Albinos in particular have this issue. If I bring one of my albinos even outside they screw their eyes shut. Is it just one or both eyes? Could you ey a pic(just to be certain)
leopardgeckos,3bpx3m,Ignitius,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:43:30 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's just too bright for them so they close one eye. Or they can be like mine and randomly do it for no reason.

You could try feeding her something different like worms or roaches.  I've heard that some geckos won't eat for a while if they're bored of their food :)  Is she getting her vitamins?

leopardgeckos,3bdytp,Squishiee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:59:33 2015 UTC,"The sidebar has some great resources. The Basic Care Sheet has some nice info. Also, plenty of people here have had multiple geckos for years and should give you great advice. But I figured I'd share what I've learned.  Spot cleaning? Clean up the poop. That's just basic decency. Cleaning the whole tank? When you can. The walls shouldn't get dirty very quickly if you aren't misting (see next paragraph).  In my experience, you don't need to mist. What you need to do is have a moist hide, a small area with moss or ecoearth or something that you keep rather moist. You don't have to worry about the humidity specifically, just keep the moist hide moist. This is much more important around the time the leo sheds. Keep the moist hide well misted before a shed, and you'll make the shedding process 10x easier. Just like keeping the UTH on half the tank, the trick with a Leo is just to give them all the tools they need to take care of themselves, and let them handle it. If they're cold, they'll go to the UTH. If they're dry, they'll go to the moist hide. If they need to cool off or get dry, they'll go somewhere else.  If your gecko is too young to be sexed, they're probably too young to be eating superworms. The rule of thumb varies, but in general, the food should not be bigger than 1/2 or 3/4 of the gecko's head. Small crickets or mealworms would be a better choice. I personally recommend crickets because hunting after crickets keeps the leo active and entertained. Mine loves it when we drop in crickets, she chases them fiercely.  My one piece of advice you didn't ask for is to try and socialize with your leo while he/she is still young. It'll pay off big."
leopardgeckos,3bdytp,lepruhkon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:54:22 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'm definitely going to be switching his food over soon and I plan on socializing my leo while he is young. :)
leopardgeckos,3bdytp,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't most the enclosure, just make sure you have a humid hide and most that everyday, you don't want the humidity in the entire tank to high for them as it's not really good.  Do NOT feed superworms, their plates are to big and they can cause impaction in smaller reptiles like leopards. Feed mealworms instead. If it's a hatchling or juvi you should feed about 10 mealies every night, once they hit sub adult you can switch to every other day. You just want to make sure they have a nice plump tail. Different geckos can be fed at different rates as adults depensing in their metabolism.   you probably won't be able to determine sex until almost a year of age."
leopardgeckos,3bdytp,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:12:56 2015 UTC,Thank you. I really wasn't aware that the superworms could cause impactions and will be switching over to crickets as soon as I can.
leopardgeckos,3bczs6,Herherpsnderps,2,Sun Jun 28 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"Eh it'll really depend on the females. Many times introducing adult females doesn't really work it well. If you raise them as babies you sef have a better chance. I use to try and house females together at the end of the season when I needed the extra room for hatchlings, but it never worked out so even in a breed operation I find it better to keep them house differently. You could always try just finding two cheap setups on cl, then you can still get two geckos and spend the same amount for double the space!(just thoroughly clean the stuff first)"
leopardgeckos,3bczs6,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:46:14 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thanks for the reply! There is an expo coming to town in a few months and I was thinking that would be my time to pick up 2/3 since I have started getting my purchases started for the enclosure. That's interesting.. I always assumed colonies of females worked well (always see breeder pics!)"
leopardgeckos,3bczs6,Herherpsnderps,3,Sun Jun 28 02:02:17 2015 UTC,"Yea..some breeder can pull it off but the animals don't always go unscathed. I tried it because other breeders do it and again, helps save me room. But there were two incidents that I'll never forget that made me change.   Once I put two females together, watch them and they were fine. A week went by of being fine. Then one day I walk in and one has the other pinned to the wall by her head. The second I put two very docile females together, they were fine for a month. One day I went in and found one female had the other by the head, ended up ripping the retina of her eye into her pupil.   I've had a lot of people assume I'm just spouting off the same copy-cat replies you always find on the internet. But I've tried with multiple females, multiples size tanks(40gal breeders with only 2). By the end it was more cost efficient to build another rack then to deal with the bites, bruises, and eye..(that female was taken care of and her eye is ok now).   The most recent being 4 females kept in a 20gal, I took two from the girl, the older one was emaciated and beat to hell..ended up dying even while on meds. The second was better but her twos were warped from mbd and she was beat up as well(although more plump since she was the food hog). It just never works out..they don't like it, and the risks could end up costing..least that's been my personal experience, and I've had to deal with a lot of geckos of the past few years :P"

leopardgeckos,3b9n0e,Pre-FartJitters,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:30:04 2015 UTC,"Haha thank you ^ I just wanted more in there and the UTH wasn't at all working well from beneath the carpet. So when I added the rocks in, it amplified the heat to perfection... Along with the overhead lamps- the side with the calc. dish is actually the warm side, and the reptihammock is his basking spot at night. I move the lamps around accordingly- during the day I have both lamps on, the light itself in the middle and red light on the hot side. Then at night I switch off the day light and move the red light to the middle. Lowers the temp to night to the seventies.  It might look like a pain to clean- it isn't. All I have to do is scoop out the rocks and stick em in a bag and slosh them around in water and a little bit of apple cider vinegar to take off any lingering odors. Everything else gets the same treatment and a little scrubbing for the water dish. The carpet gets soaked in the diluted vinegar and water, washed off, then put in the dryer. The tank itself gets a good rinse down once a month- otherwise it's just wiped out. The hide I just made in the corner that has the moss in it might seem messy since it doesn't have a bottom but all I have to do is shake the repti-rug out and clean it like normal. Takes about five minutes to wash everything down. About thirty minutes in total since the bulk of the time is actually just taking the stuff out and putting it back in."

My guys loved when I had a rack with a plexiglass doors(they're they're in a rack) they'd run over and watch me whenever I was in the room. Most leopards, when you take them now, generally aren't afraid and can even seek your attention. So having the glass they can see through should help a bit.   Also see if you can buy from a breede who breeds for temperment as its hertirary. If you get a gecko that comes from puppy dog like parents you have a better chance of them having that same relaxed temperment"
leopardgeckos,3azzrq,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:56:58 2015 UTC,Where would you find a breeder who breeds for temperment? I always thought most breeders focused on morphs.
leopardgeckos,3azzrq,greeneyedpopeye,2,Thu Jun 25 05:06:19 2015 UTC,Most do but there's a handful that also look at temperament. You can always just ask the temperment of the parents as well. I do it and learned it from a well known breeder in the UK.  I know there's another in my area as well.
leopardgeckos,3azzrq,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:20:50 2015 UTC,"Hey again,  Sorry about all the questions but I'm really having a hard time trying to prep before I buy a little guy. I'm seeing a lot of differing opinions on the gradient of heat in a leo viv. I'm currently running at about 29C on my heat mat and about 26C on the cool side.  The heat mat is just under half of the cage,  I was looking for a smaller one but it seemed to be either just under half of the Viv or around a quarter so I went for the larger.  Is the 3 degree temp change sufficient or should I look at maybe pulling the mat out a little to reduce the amount of surface area the mat is covering?  Cheers.  Jason.  P.S. It's about 26C outside of the viv also so I'm not sure if the cool side would be any cooler on a day when essex isn't so bloomin' hot!  Update: I checked this morning and the warm side was 33ish, cool was around 25 by the time I left, I am a bit happier with that result."
leopardgeckos,3azzrq,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:03:56 2015 UTC,"I was about to say 29c is a tad to low on the hot side but if those were you temps this morning just make sure they stay at  25 cool and 33 hot and you'll be good! Those temps are almost spot on. Under half the cage isn't the worst thing in the world. Just make sure your taking floor temp and not air temp. The ambient temp on the hot side isn't as by of a deal because they lay their bellies on the hot floor and that's what helps them digest. So even if the hot side ambient is only 85f as long as the is 90f you're fine. No worries about messaging me, feel free to pm me any time!"
leopardgeckos,3azzrq,fellowfeelings,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:58:50 2015 UTC,As long as you have enough hides you'll be fine. I also added some fake vines/plants to my Viv and I think it's a good idea just cause it adds some extra security :)

leopardgeckos,3aw49u,GamerGir1,2,Wed Jun 24 13:57:24 2015 UTC,"Eh it's still a loose substrate that they can eat, which isn't great. But more so eco earth is for tropical and subtropical species because it raises humidity. They're from an arid desert which is all rock and hard packed dirt and burrow in the ground during the day(hence the humid hides). So it's really not natural or good for them. It's ok in humid hides because they don't eat in their humid hide and the humidity is contained to a small box. Tile is about as cheap and easy as you can get to their natural habitat. There's also excavator clay but that takes a lot of time and a game plan as far as setup goes"
leopardgeckos,3aw49u,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:48:55 2015 UTC,"The excavator clay is really cool, but needs to be cleaned out often as it dries out and loosens up, leaving sand in spots."

leopardgeckos,3auoqu,FrumbleHumpkins,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:32:43 2015 UTC,That viv is too small. Would be okay for a baby but your Leo would quickly outgrow it.  You could try a couple local pet stores to see if they make custom ones. The one near me makes aquariums and vivs in any size you ask.
leopardgeckos,3auoqu,haobabidi27,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:45:59 2015 UTC,The one with the link is way to small that's barely a 5 gal and thy require a 20gal(if the dimensions you talked about were length and width that'd be a bit closer). But it can actually be harder to use uths in the wood enclosures  There's nothing wrong with aquariums as far as heating. A uth and f you live in a cold climate perhaps a low wattage basking lamp to raise the ambient temp.
leopardgeckos,3auoqu,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much guys, I did expect it to be too small but was just guessing. A second one I'm looking at is 45x45x45cm (18x18x18in) so I think that works out at about 90l (~20gal) but I'm a bit worried that there is a lot of height there. Does height factor into it or could it be mitigated with some large grapevines to climb on?"

leopardgeckos,3asyce,Bababou,2,Tue Jun 23 07:53:16 2015 UTC,"Feeding once a week is not ok, especially do they juvi a. You need to feed them 10 mealworms per juvinile until they get close to adult size. Also I'm guessing you mean temps tire when you ask climate? This really should've been done before you got the animals, but here's a care sheet you should look over and stick to. The temps are very important, if they're off your animal could die. Also you must supplement with calcium, I'd recommend just keeping some in the mealworms dish"

Her ovulation cycle will end by that time and she'll be nice and fat. Also, make sure that they can't see each other. She might be able to smell him, but without visual confirmation he won't exist."

leopardgeckos,3ap1q5,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:43:56 2015 UTC,I would keep feeding her the dubias and increase the wax worms. Make sure you're dusting her food with calcium powder and that the feeders are gutloaded with the highest quality food you can give them

leopardgeckos,3akqfp,SpeedyClaxton54,2,Sun Jun 21 03:55:09 2015 UTC,"Actually laying on top of eachother is dominant behavior and not good. They're essentially fighting over the ""best spot"". The difference now is one must've become more submissive.These animals won't ""cuddle"" because they really don't like company or bond with one another. Anothe gecko in the tank is purely competition, some just handle it better.   However when they get bigger unless you know they're genders(temped sexed from breeder) your gonna have to separate them for a bit. A male hit sexual maturity young and will breed the female to young. If she's under 45g she may not be big enough to pass the eggs and will die. Also even when they get older a male will non-stop pester a female to mate which usually leads to fights. So unless they're both females that tolerate each other, you may need another tank anyways. I always have to keep all my adults breeders separate, males and females, because I've had females throw down to many times."
leopardgeckos,3akqfp,Herherpsnderps,0,Sun Jun 21 13:42:49 2015 UTC,With that many options if they had an issue with each other they would not be in the same hide.  They may have gotten to big to be comfortable next to each other. Do they show actual aggression towards each other or just giving themselves more room?
leopardgeckos,3akqfp,Bababou,0,Sun Jun 21 07:59:00 2015 UTC,"I havent seen any aggressive behavior, they just seem to be giving each other more space."
leopardgeckos,3aiho0,TallCoolDrinkOWater,2,Sat Jun 20 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"Soak him in warm water for 15mins and the skin should roll off. If it's a bad shed you may need to remove it with tweezers. Out of curiousity do you use sand? Everyone's hears sand is bad for impaction, but its actually worse for toes. If you don't use sand then just make sure you have a humid hide(cheap Tupperware with a hole and some moss). Good luck! If you have any more questions let me know :)  Edit: sorry I saw yor setup in another post and you don't use sand, sorry for the assumption! If you gecko doesn't use the humid hide you may just need to soak him every now and again or if you see him ping it and about to she's just mist his tank that day. That should loosen up the skin for when he goes to shed"

I use to try to do a mix of crickets and mealworms, but once a cricket got under the dish In one of my males enclosure. The cricket ended up biting his tail tip and it got infected. Treated it, but he still lost the very tip, so ever since then i dont bother. Also when you have 20+ geckos it takes a long time to take the crickets out after 15mins, a bowl of mealworms is easier for me."
leopardgeckos,3ab6de,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:42:45 2015 UTC,I don't like messing with crickets simply because of the noise they make.  Do you gutload your mealworms or just put calcium on them?

leopardgeckos,3aahky,thirdearth,2,Thu Jun 18 14:56:08 2015 UTC,I'm no expert but I would say give him 2 or 3 days then think about lowering the Temps on the hot hide if he doesn't leave the cold side.. Also is the temp the floor temp or air? I wouldn't sweat it to much it took mine 2 days to go in her humid hide and now she almost never leaves!
leopardgeckos,3aahky,MGcubed,2,Thu Jun 18 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"The temp is the floor temp - I have the thermostat that's measured by probe and also a digital thermometer with a probe. The air temp on the cool side is roughly 75 degrees - 80 at the hottest. I checked in on him as soon as I got back and he's still in the cool hide, so I'm just going to trust that it's stress-related and he will get used to everything with a little more time. I'll lower the temperature on the hot side if things don't get better in the next week. Thanks for the advice!"
leopardgeckos,3aahky,OxymoronicFlannel,2,Fri Jun 19 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"Just focussing on the fact your gecko is sticking to one hide and not coming out much, it really does depend on the gecko, there isn't a set time to when they'll come out more.  I got two geckos at the same time. Same set up's pretty much bar some decorations. They're both females too, one of them is always out at night exploring, on top of her hide, going between the humid and hot hide mainly.   The other one took at least 2-3 weeks before she felt comfortable coming out more. Geckos and animals in general will vary when it comes to how long it takes them to settle. I'd try not to worry and let him settle in.  The latter who originally just stuck to the hot hide for the first 2-3 weeks is now almost never out of the humid hide when she's not exploring.   You will worry because you don't want something to go wrong, but if your temperatures are fine and everything is set up correctly it'll just need time, try not to keep lifting the hide up, although you already know this as you said. :)"
leopardgeckos,3aahky,greeneyedpopeye,2,Fri Jun 19 13:03:31 2015 UTC,"Hey buddy! I had the same problem with mine in April.  When we brought her home from an expo she was defensive and scared all the time. Due to that she stayed in the cool hide for a couple of days. She would walk out at night but if she heard any noise she would go back and hide and not move for a while.  eventually she found the hot hide and loved it. In my opinion, give the gecko time, let it adjust to its new awesome home.  It took mine a little over a week to get somewhat comfortable.  Hoped this helps!"

Let it eat as many as it wants in a 10 minute period, though ours would eat too fast and vomit, so we fed him one at a time, about 10-12 while he was still growing.   For adults, we feed every other or every third day, and just a few worms to our male (he's got a nice fat tail), and about 6 large worms to our female, as she is a bit more lean.   Be sure to gut load the insects before you feed them, and dust them with a calcium powder to help prevent mbd. You can also leave a dish of calcium out for them too."

leopardgeckos,3a3pa7,KoopaTheCrocodile,2,Tue Jun 16 23:59:31 2015 UTC,"the setup is much better! They're both normal morphed. As far as the toes go if you can get a tupperware and cut a few holes in it, then put about a 1/2 of warm water in(enough to cover their feet) and put the lid on and let them soak 10-15mins. If you do it this way as opposed to fighting to keep them in the sink, they'll generally stay calmer, making it easier to soak them. Just don't forget them in the tupperware :P"

leopardgeckos,3a2w8p,mynameisfreddit,2,Tue Jun 16 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"What are his temps at? He's most likely not feeding because his temps are dropping in the winter, so be can't metabolize the food. Floor temp and ambient temp would help greatly!  Switching to mealworms is fine, I breed and raise geckos off of mealworms exclusively, just avoid superworms. He can easily live to 20 years, that's they're general average in captivity, but now that our knowledge on these animals is improving that number may start going up as well."

leopardgeckos,3a2w8p,Herherpsnderps,2,Wed Jun 17 11:35:19 2015 UTC,"Oh hod thats your problem..thats way to cold!! They need at wlast 88 to properly digest their food. 90f hot side and 75f cool side. His cool temps right now are the lowest temp he should ever get, under 70 is very bad. They really need the heat in their eniroment to clmplete simple Metabolisc functions like digestion.   Your gecko is just being smart and not eating to much becsuse his body cant digest it and itll rot in his gut. Hes not eating becsuse eating to much will loterally kill him at those temps. If you dont have a uth you need to get one, and if your house is that cold youll need a heat lamp. Do yoy have a picture of him and his setup? Make sure hes not on sand also"
leopardgeckos,3a2w8p,Herherpsnderps,2,Wed Jun 17 12:25:11 2015 UTC,"Oh really, thanks poor guy must be cold. I have a heat lamp but he usually presses himself against the glass in an attempt to stay cool if I turn it on so I haven't had it on in ages. The thermometer is on the cool side and my flat is central heated so it doesnt get that cold in the winter. The heat mat has a thermostat as well. I'll be sure to double check the temperature and I will put a thermometer on the hot side, and take appropriate measures to keep in those parameters. Substrate is cork, I've been thinking about changing it to slate or carpet."
leopardgeckos,3a2w8p,Herherpsnderps,2,Wed Jun 17 12:43:41 2015 UTC,Well over 95 can stess then out as well. If yoy have a good grsdient snd it doesnt wt to hot. Although under tank heaters are much better than lamps for them. Some lamps depending on wattage can be to strong and also to bright(they have pretty sensituve eyes). So when the lamps on it may be to hot but shen you turn it off its to cold. For one of the setups for an ex breeder we keep in an exo terra my house stays about 68f so we use a small 25watt basking bulb to raise up the ambient temp to 75-80 depensing on side and then a uth ynder 1/3 of the tank to being the floor of the hot side up to 90(belly heat is really good for them)

I was so puzzled haha   I wouldn't call it -wrong- to keep it open, but it does defeat the purpose of a hide, it can still be something good for him to climb and use though. I would advise putting in a humid hide(tupperware container with a hole and some moss is cheap and easy!). the only issue you really have is the heat, over 95F is wayyy to hot and can sweriously stress them out and ruin an appetite. Upwards of 100F is a very bad place for the temps to be. I'd recommend ditching the ceramic and getting a UTh, they're much better for leos anyways and then you can leave it on all night as well."

leopardgeckos,3973hg,MountainDrew23,3,Tue Jun 9 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same thing happen to a gecko of mine, and later happened to my friend's gecko.  I ended up putting my gecko down due to this and other health issues. She had a severe case of MBD, lost an enormous amount of weight, and couldn't hold food down. I'm still unsure if the eye infection was related to the latter two of her symptoms. I suspect that she was so weak when the infection hit, it spread quickly.  My friend's gecko went through a number of vet visits before they could track down a solution. In the end, they swabbed its' eye to determine the cause of the cloudyness and prescribed a specific type of eyedrops. The infection cleared, however the gecko is now partially blind due to the delay of treatment.   I'm sorry I couldn't provide more detailed information - but if there's one thing I must encourage, please see a vet as soon as possible. I wish you all the best."

leopardgeckos,393u9b,S3804,2,Tue Jun 9 01:46:56 2015 UTC,"Get her to a vet, if you can't do that immediately get calcium in her somehow until you can. One of my geckos came to me with MBD, bowing legs and bad spine, but as long as their jaw isn't in serious pain you can get calcium powder in them or put liquid calcium in her water source."
leopardgeckos,393u9b,KaulitzWolf,2,Tue Jun 9 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"I dust her food with calcium, and give her D3 twice a week... problem is that she's not eating, and therefore won't take the calcium. I haven't seen liquid calcium in the stores here. Can I try mixing powdered calcium into her water?   On the vet thing, there's only one herp vet about 2 hrs from where I am, and she has an appointment but not until the end of the month. I can't afford to pay the emergency visit fee. :("
leopardgeckos,393u9b,KaulitzWolf,2,Tue Jun 9 14:38:18 2015 UTC,"I second the advice of /u/orangeunrhymed however if she does start showing signs of MBD you can get liquid calcium on Amazon or you can feed her pure powder.

leopardgeckos,392gds,The_Autumn_Wind,3,Mon Jun 8 19:43:23 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a vet visit. You may have done more harm feeding her those pinkies than anything else. They're exclusively a treat at most, otherwise to be avoided. They're basically as if you lived off butter, lots of fat but low in actual nutrition. To many can actually cause fatty liver disease.  What're your temps running at? It's claimed that the average life in captivity is about 20years however our knowledge on that is still sketchy given most rarely die from actual old age, it's usually something we did wrong in the captive care. Even within the past 10yeara our understanding of how to care for them in captivity has changed drastically"
leopardgeckos,392gds,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:03:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  Temps are about 85-90 hot side/ 70 cool side.  I know the all-pinky diet wasn't ideal but I couldnt get him to eat crickets or mealworms so pinkies it was.  I'll see if a local vet has any suggestions.
leopardgeckos,392gds,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"Hrm yea his temps are fine. You can try to use some baby chicken food with cslcium mixed in(chicken in broth only, Gerbers works) to try and at least get some protein in him to help with his appetite for now. It's an ok short term food to get something in them to jump start their metabolism. But a vet would def know best, if it isn't environmental making him not eat then it could just be an illness"
leopardgeckos,392gds,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:29:42 2015 UTC,Thanks again.  I'll see if takes some baby food. I've heard if you rub it on their nose they'll lick it off which kinda forces them to eat.

leopardgeckos,38xc12,AMuseXD,2,Sun Jun 7 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"The setup looks really good! As far as your temp questions go, you want a 75 cool side and a 90 hot side, so 84 ambient throughout the tank is more on the high side then the low side. As far as the hot side goes as long as the floor is 90 it's ok, you really don't want the ambient temp of the hot side to hot, heat can stress them out."
leopardgeckos,38xc12,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:05:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that means a lot coming from you! :) Just to clarify, the 84 is the temperature of the hot end of the tank (the thermometer probe is attached to the wall of the hot end), which is why I was concerned given that it's basically telling me that there's a 7 degree difference between inside of the hide and directly outside of it.  Also, sorry for the late response. Work and all that :P"
leopardgeckos,38xc12,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:55:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply as well :p as long as there's that 90 warm spot it won't be the end of the world. You want about 1/3 of the tank to be the hot side. I'd keep an eye that he/she is using the hide. Also keep an eye on the appetite, biggest indicator when they aren't happy with the temps in their rank is the appetite drops off"
leopardgeckos,38xc12,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"She's almost exculsively using the warm hide right now. I've had her 2 days, so she's just getting used to it now but I think everything's alright. She ate 8-9 mealworms last night, so hopefully she's content! I haven't seen any poop in the enclosure yet though, how long should I wait before this should be seen as a concern?  edit: oh wait, I just shined a flashlight into the warm hide and there's a poop right in the middle, haha. Since she's still adjusting to the tank, is it too soon to try and potty-train her? I would put a piece of paper towel in a corner of the cool end, but I'm pretty sure she's not comfortable enough to come out that far (at least while I'm around) for the time being."
leopardgeckos,38tnkz,munchidk,2,Sat Jun 6 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"He will keep biting her as he tries to mate her, only two things will happen. She'll be ovulating and let him mate her, which you should be prepared for, have extra supplements and know how to breed. Otherwise,Id avoid doing it since lacking knowledge in breeding can get your animal killed(egg binding, mbd,ect). Or she won't be ovulating, won't want to be bred, and will turn to attack him. If they're living happily apart I'd leave them that way.  Edit: some grammar and spelling, I'm terrible on a mobile :p"

leopardgeckos,38s34r,Bababou,3,Sat Jun 6 09:24:14 2015 UTC,"There is no right answer to this question. A female can retain the sperm of a male for an entire season to produce eggs. If she mates with multiple males, she could very well maintain the sperm from all the males and produce babies ""fathered"" at random. Nature is far less interested in keeping track of lineage than we are :) and far more interested in facilitating reproduction."

leopardgeckos,38s34r,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"If they've been mated then it's probably to late, females can retain the sperm throughout the entire season. You can attempt to mate the other male if you don't think they've mated. You'll know one way or another if the babies come out tremper or not as to if it took. But generally once they mate it's locked in,, sometimes first year females don't retain as well and need a second mating but I've never personally had to do this. she may rretained both sperm though. Whats the first male genetic wise? At this point though, since you just got the male you should probably quarantine 30days."

Since they're cold blooded they rely on. Their enviroment for changing the temps in their body for different metabolic processes. You need a 75cool side and 90 hot side, but 90 should be the floor temp. They must have a cool side though or they'll get stressed by the constant heat. Stress will cause them not to eat"

I put together a incubator made from a styrofoam cooler with a heating pad on the inside bottom and two water bottles to absorb the heat and keep the incubation chamber from getting to hot. I made the incubation chamber out of a tupperware container filled with vermiculite that I had moistened. I put the eggs in and about a month and a half later I woke up one morning to find two baby leos in the container! I even saw one of them hatch from their egg! It was an awesome moment!

It looks like she has the eclipse eyes, however, is missing the patternless gene. A radar is the bell version of a raptor. So it has to have the eclipse, red patternless stripe, and albino. If she has the banding then she doesn't have the patternless stripe or she's only het for it. I really hate when breeders try to pass off a morph as a more expensive morph >< it happens way to much. I'm hoping you didn't pay to much at least, but the eclipse gene is nice! That hypo tang is also super vibrant"

leopardgeckos,38acey,demial,2,Wed Jun 3 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"It is better to find a sitter and let them stay at your home. Taking them with is putting your own needs before what is better for them. Moving leos is highly stressful, they won't understand what's going on and may even stop eating for a while as compared to staying at home in an environment they're comfortable in and know.   If you can not keep them with you as a carry on they will definitely die below. Unlike cats and dogs who can regulate their body temperatures (it's hell  for them if they are packed like common luggage too) leos are cold blooded.   If you want to do what's best for you because you are selfish and emotionally can't stand to be separated from them at least make sure you can carry them in the cabin in a container with both a warm and moist hide. They will hate this and be extremely unhappy. Even if they are unpacked into their tank when they arrive they will know they are somewhere different and likely will hide a lot more than usual and will also likely act much different and stressed around you. It might have longterm affects on their personalities. Expect that they might die from the stress of the experience. So if you are hell bent on bringing them with you at the very least meet their physical needs.  If you want to do what is best for them LEAVE THEM HOME."

Use water crystals in a small dish to hydrate because they drown in open water.  Or cut up potatoes or carrots works for water and some food for them.  You want to feed them quality foods, grains and dried fruit.  There are companies selling roach chow for this very reason. They grow kind of slow, I ordered a bunch of small ones to feed off and 20 or so adults to seed the colony and it has worked well.  Just keep it some what warm and mist it daily.  They are a sub tropical or tropical roach so they need some heat to grow right."

I remember you had issues with an older gecko as well, could she could've caught something from him? If he had parasites she may as well, which would explain some of her odd behavior. I know before you had good temps so if they didn't change then that shouldn't be the issue. Also if she's pooping it can't possibly be impaction, impaction would be nothing would be able to pass. But odd poops like you've had trouble with can be due to internal parasites"
leopardgeckos,37odvk,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 29 12:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yes I did have another one before. She had parasites and unfortunately passed. We bleached the tank several times and let it dry, the whole shabang, but while it was drying outside the wind blew it over and it busted so this is a whole new tank. Her other poop was very watery. It was very odd. No one had an answer for that, and her most recent one was normal, just small. Also thanks for your advice with Yoshi, it was helpful but she was young and just wasn't tough enough to make it. Rio has a nice tail on her so I'm thinking she'll be alright till we can identify the problem"
leopardgeckos,37odvk,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 29 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"Well if you have any of that parasite medicine left over or can order some maybe give her a bit to be on the safe side(I believe it has a decent shelf life?). But she's def not impacted, beyond that I could only guess parasites, which wouldnt necessarily be anything you could help. Many times it comes from feeders. Id recommend rainbow mealworms personally, they have super healthy mealies. I buy them in the thousands and they last me months, I believe it's $14 for 3000 of them or somethig crazy"

leopardgeckos,37odvk,Sweetsmyle,1 point,Sat May 30 03:42:06 2015 UTC,That would do it as well if the temps were off. Over 95 can make them not eat as well as under 88 on the warm side. So it could just be unstable temps
leopardgeckos,37odvk,quackycac,2,Sat May 30 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"So I just passed my first winter with Rio. It was hard. She barley ate, very little poop, slight weight loss. I figured she'd be back to normal in the spring, but then was informed that ovulation can mess up eating habits and all that jazz, so I again gave it some time. Now we're entering summer, and she is pooping occasionally, small amounts, but I don't notice her eating much. Her dish has roaches in it and I don't see numbers dropping very much but she still poops every 3 or 4 days so idk what's up. I noticed some moss which I use for her moist hide substrate, in her poop not too long ago, but she seems to have passed it all as there hasn't been any in her recent poops. I changed the moist substrate to paper towels, but I'm worried she may have a small impaction still. She never laid any eggs this season either, I don't have her with a male do is this normal or do they still lay unfertilized eggs? So things are more or less alright, but I'd like some opinions on how her stomach looks and if I can get any info from that. Thanks!"
leopardgeckos,37odvk,Apicalmeristem,1 point,Fri May 29 03:19:40 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, watch the paper towels for chunks eaten out of it. Mine was eating moss so I switched her to paper towels and she ate that too. Now I just put repti carpet in her moist hide and just make sure it's wet in there."

leopardgeckos,37liui,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 29 10:53:32 2015 UTC,The girls I was told tremper. The male I was just told tangerine and assumed he was albino because the brown banding he gets on his back. I didn't even consider the black spots on the tail. I determined hypo baldie and a tiny tiny bit of carot tail on my own past that. None of these were really high end all three were under $100 each so the genetics I know are hit and miss with this level. I wanted a giant male in my collection guess that will be my tremper male as well.

Many hypos even start out with some light banding, as they age, the spots and banding fade.

I'm starting to learn more about genetics and morphs because I hope to breed in the future.

leopardgeckos,3769gl,IzzyConrad92,2,Mon May 25 05:52:15 2015 UTC,Geckos make noises when they are stressed normally.  I've only had one that purred for lack of a better description and rubbed his head on me. Does you gecko have enough space? Do you have a wrap around your tank?(like decrotive plants) I had one that did something similar but I put one of those on his tank and he stopped.  It has to do with security.  Let me know if that helps. I've never had a gecko alone so I do not know if they get lonely.
leopardgeckos,3769gl,MaverickKira,1 point,Mon May 25 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"She's in a 29 gallon tank by herself. She has 3 different hides to go in, in different parts of the tank. I didn't think about a tank wrap, her tank is in the corner of my room so all but the front and one side are open. Maybe I'll find a plant and put a tank wrap up. Thank you, I'll let you know how it goes."
leopardgeckos,3769gl,Etsecla,2,Mon May 25 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"Is she doing it with a ""yawn""? I don't know how else to describe the action, but when leos are young their yawns or w/e that behavior is, is sometimes vocalized. I wouldn't worry about it too much either way. I had one animal with me for over 10 years and when he was 6 he chirped out for the first and only time in his life that I am aware of."
leopardgeckos,36x7b2,shootsmcgavins,4,Fri May 22 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"The only value in pinkies is the fat. Some breeders will feed them to females right before a breeding season. But relying on pinkies to keep your gecko healthy is a bad idea, while the protein is good to much fat is bad. Also processing the bones for cslcium is good but also more work than their digestive tract should be doing on a normal basis.  They should never be used as a staple. As far as fruits and veggies go whoever was feeding those was wrong. People try all sorts of things on leopards and post it online, doesn't mean it's all right though.  If I can find the articles I'll link them but it's been a long time since I read them."
leopardgeckos,36x7b2,Herherpsnderps,2,Fri May 22 21:33:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight!
leopardgeckos,36x7b2,Etsecla,2,Wed May 27 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know that just because a Leopard Gecko can process a food that it should be processing that food in captivity. It's well known that in the wild these guys eat lots of scorpions. In captivity however no one feeds scorpions for the obvious reason that you do not want to risk harming your pet animal. What type of meat are you considering? I really can't think of anything small enough for them to consume that is ""meat"". As for scholarly articles, if you look up biological/ecological reports from Pakistan etc. you will find reports of wild animals that were dissected and they always include the stomach contents."

leopardgeckos,36h069,Ignitius,2,Tue May 19 13:07:03 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised at how resilient Leopard Geckos are to falls from heights. I have platforms and ladders in my geckos cage because they love to climb and instead of climbing down the easy way I have often seen them just dangle from their back feet and fall to the floor. They are little monkeys. However none of my platforms are 50cm high so you might want to keep an eye out for injuries but she's probably ok. If you see her acting strange in any way, even if you don't see any injuries, go ahead and take her to the vet just in case."

leopardgeckos,36h069,sassybluewhale,1 point,Tue May 19 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"One of my younger leos escaped when he was around 2mos old, into a house with three cats who had to be locked inside so they'd stop hunting the native lizards.   We found him around 20hr later in a closet two flights of stairs and the entire house away from where his viv is. Far as we can figure, he wiggled under the door of the lizard room, creeped his way across the house, and threw himself off of the stairwell (skipping both flights of stairs) before scuttling into the nearby closet.   When we found him he was so upset that he bit our fingers all the way back to his home. The only thing I did differently than you was that I allowed him to warm up slowly in my hands before placing him in his home, only because I have been told that if they warm up too quickly it can cause neurological issues, but YMMV. He's none the worse for wear and has filled out since then."

leopardgeckos,36gey1,KaulitzWolf,3,Tue May 19 04:43:50 2015 UTC,"The apotting is normal, she's a murphys patternless and they have that as hatchlings, as they grow the spots fade into a solid color. That said, Id be more concerned about her legs, It may just be the picture but it looks like they're starting to warp. This is usually a sign of the start of mbd(metabolic bone disease) so try and give her lots of extra calcium for a bit"
leopardgeckos,36gey1,Herherpsnderps,2,Tue May 19 11:04:44 2015 UTC,"That's what I was worried about, I gave her a big dose of just calcium powder (with vit D3) and let er settle in, I dust all the food for my geckos every feeding, but I was thinking about ordering some liquid calcium to dose the water too so I know she's getting enough.  A part of me wishes I'd noticed it at the store, but it seems like it's just starting to affect her so it's better she's out of there so she can get the care she needs."

They said she's really fond of meal worms, but the crickets definitely weren't dusted so I don't see why the meal worms would have been. I'll keep dusting, giving her powder, and I'm getting a liquid supplement too so i'll dose the water."
leopardgeckos,36gey1,demial,1 point,Thu May 21 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"Primarily i'm concerned about the white spot on her head (although that might just be a normal spot) and the way her back sits when she rests. In motion she walks fine, but resting there's a deep curve in her spine and she seems to take deeper but less frequent breaths than my other girl while her body spreads out, although that could be a size thing? I'd just like to know if she had any actual issues a vet might need to look at, if I can resolve it with good care and diet, or if she's perfectly healthy and I shouldn't worry.   Edit: Watching her walk, I'm concerned  she has MBD or something similar."

Furthermore, they aren't stupid when it comes to food. They are attracted to movement, and even if you wiggled a piece of kale in front of one and managed to get it to bite it would likely spit it out.  They know what's food and what isnt for the most part.  Feeding the greens to the feeders on the other hand is a good idea."

I was under the impression that they were strictly carnivorous, with a few rare exception stories where someone was able to get their one gecko to eat a tiny bit of strawberry.   The idea is to gut load the insects with the greens and fruits, and then feed them to the gecko, as sort of packages for the nutrition."
leopardgeckos,365vcp,baseballfanatic2,1 point,Sat May 16 13:09:24 2015 UTC,"Eh if your going to breed Leo's this is a good walkthrough to give you an idea how to do it but it leaves a lot of info out as well. You should make sure the female is ovulating first, you can't just throw a male and female together and then be ok breeding. Most females if they aren't ovulsting will fight a male trying to breed them. Also, I tried super hatch once and woulsnt really recommend it.   Doesn't say anything about marking the eggs(as they can shift so marking the top keeps them from getting rotated). Also hatchlings shouldn -never- be housed with even juviniles, let alone adults. They didn't really make that a big enough deal about this to me, as an adult, especially a male, will kill a hatchling."

But either way a Leo's age doesn't really matter, depending on how you feed them thy can grow faster or slower. But generally at 20-25g I can tell size. From a breeder usually makes it easier to distinguish sex from an early age as well because they generally temp sex their animals. That said, Id still avoid putting her with another gecko"

leopardgeckos,35wg5o,Herherpsnderps,2,Thu May 14 07:10:12 2015 UTC,"If your humid hide is raising the ambient humidity up so much then there's something not right with it. I've had my humid hides very wet before and never an issue, and my guys are in a tub rack system which usually hold humidity more. It's really only the enviroment thata causes raised humidity in the enclosures. But eithet way, I would recommend not advising againest humid hides, as while you may catch the stuck toe sheds, not everyone will. Also the stuck sheds isn't normal or a good sign. In the wild they go into deep burrows during the daylight hours that are humid, so it's part of their natural habitat, which, when kept in captivity we should mimic as much as possible.  Edit: also just thought of this but if your using one of those wall dials to check your humidity it may be messed up. The temp and humidity dials are known for having a lot of issues. I had to replace the one my friend was using for him because it was so off. Especially if water had ever touched them, if you most the enclosure or water had gotten on it somehow it'll never read correctly again. They're super sensitive and cheaply built so they mess up easier. The probe and digital ones are better, where the main unit is outside the tank and just the reader is inside."
leopardgeckos,35wg5o,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Thu May 14 12:17:55 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I'm not advising against humid hides but rather that a leos husbandry may need to be adjusted based on the temp/humidity in our own environments.  I had previously just been using wet paper towels.  I don't doubt that the humidity in my home is very high though even if my gauge is off.  It pretty much feels ""soggy"" most of the winter and it rains quite a bit here."
leopardgeckos,35wg5o,zozzer101,1 point,Thu May 14 23:33:05 2015 UTC,"Yea, but I use exo earth and moss, to wet it I pour water into the humid hide. Also some moisture in a hide shouldn't cause more humidity than standing water in a water dish. I've seen the temp gauges be off 30degees, I doubt the humidity gauges are built much better. But Leo's have been in captivity for a long time so it's not like we don't understand their husbandry at this point.

It's not like they will suffer if they are alone. They are solitary animals, let them be.   If you have multiple geckos in a tank, great. I hope it continues to work out.

But yea all my leoprds really like being housed apart, and it makes my life much easier. Every time I've tried to put a pair of girls together to make room for breeding it never works out well, they're stressed and so am I. I don't have to worry about fighting or food issues."
leopardgeckos,35vjcw,BenzieBox,3,Thu May 14 12:14:29 2015 UTC,I'll never understand the mindset of people who want to house predominantly solitary animals together. They don't want friends. If you want community animals then go get community animals.
leopardgeckos,35wf1v,Archkyoji,1 point,Thu May 14 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"So, identifying some of the morphs visually is a lot easier when the gecko is still young. That being said your guy is a normal leopard gecko. He does exhibit really high ""speckling"" meaning he has a lot of black spots that are isolated on his head and body to his tubercles. Speckling is sometimes but not always, exhibited by animals that are ""het"" for murphys patternless or blizzard. He could also be a mack snow, which is much easier to determine in a young gecko.  tl;dr - he's a normal leopard gecko. he may have some hets or be a snow, but you cannot know without test breeding."

leopardgeckos,35oqxs,wrathlet,1 point,Wed May 13 17:43:33 2015 UTC,Look up Lizardlandscapes  on YouTube. He will teach you how to do all of this plus more. (Minus the mushrooms)  Well I didn't take any pictures of the progress but I'll try to describe it  But pretty much what I did is I got a thin sheet of polystyrene.   Then I cut it to fit the back of the tank and the left side. I used Loctite power grab to glue together.  Then cut out from the polystyrene a bunch of little rectangles. Then i used those to make the hide on the left. My place in the next to each other and gluing them down. In the same thing to the other hide. Found out the left side was massive so I split it to a bottom and top hide.  Once I created a decent wall thing I let the Loctite powergrab dry overnight.   Then I used great stuff expanding foam all over the entire thing. Once the phone was fully hardened i then carved that out to my liking.   I've then used unsanded grout and covered it 3 times with decently thick coats.   Then I proceeded to glue on the mushrooms.  To make the mushrooms I got a bunch of thin rope and cut it to one inch or  three or four inch intervals. I then coated and hot glue and roll it around carefully on a sheet of parchment paper. I curved and kind of held it till it was dry.  to make the caps I put this kind of a circle of hot glue on the parchment paper. When they were almost done cooling off I pick them up and kind of pressed in the middle to make a mushroom cap shape. I've been just hot glue the cap to the stem.  If you would like I can make a tutorial on how to make the mushrooms. I found a tutorial on the internet but I can't find it.

leopardgeckos,35juai,munchidk,4,Mon May 11 04:40:47 2015 UTC,"Mine are the same, they pretty much will not eat crickets anymore because it is too much trouble for them to catch them, even when I have it in a tiny cup right in front of their face. They do ok with meal worms but only if there is a little pile of them so they can just stick their mouth in the bowl and grab a mouthful without even looking. They both can see just fine because they always come to the corner of the cage and want to be picked up when I come in the room but hunting is just too much of an effort. I think some of it has to do with the fact that they have such big fat stores built up, it's not a catch it or die scenario. They know that if they don't get the cricket on the first grab the big fleshy thing that brings food and rides (me) will just give them another cricket and clean up the old one. They are really quite spoiled creatures and they enjoy their lives."

You did really well with the multiple hides and avoiding sand, thats a mistake a lot of people make. Just make sure you have a solid 90 hot side and 75 cool side which is usuaolly near impossible in a 10gal given the short length  However I'd def separate them asap given their size, males reach sexual maturity around 25g where as females aren't a safe breeding size until 45g, so many times a male will breed a female to young and she will die by eggbinding(basically her body is to small to pass the eggs). Also the normals tail is wayy skinner than the blizzard/leucistic(what the store calls ""fancy""). I'd recommend getting 2 separate 20gals so you can avoid breeding to early, and the smaller one can get food better. Also a 10gal is to small for even 1 gecko, two is really squishing it. That said you can usually find good deals on cl, just make sure ya clean the tanks and decor!"

leopardgeckos,35krpb,Herherpsnderps,2,Tue May 12 01:46:36 2015 UTC,No problem! He looks just shy of 25g so yu should be ok for another week or two depending on how fast he's growing. Glad it could help! Good luck :)
leopardgeckos,35krpb,anasiana,2,Tue May 12 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"They need underbelly heat. That lamp is useless. They are also going to need to be separated as they get bigger, especially if you suspect they may be of opposite sex. And the moist hide should be in there all the time. For the time being, if you can't separate them immediately, I would recommend feeding them separately to make sure both of them are eating enough. One may just be growing faster, but it's always better to be on the safe side."

leopardgeckos,35hij6,Etsecla,1 point,Sun May 10 14:18:00 2015 UTC,Gotta be careful though with lots of genes in the mix. You want to be able to accurately tell your customers the genetics and possible hets animals you sell. The bold stripe stuff is really popular too i forgot to mention earlier. Trick there is that it's line bred so you have to produce quantity in order to select for quality.

But unless you know what the parents were there's no sure way to tell between bell and tremper because incubation temp and whatnot can change how they look.(trempers can be made to look like bells and vise versa)"

leopardgeckos,35cri0,funkydonuts,2,Sat May 9 01:36:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless you're ready to house 10+ hatchlings I'd just squish the eggs. She's going to continue laying 2 eggs every 20ish days or so. I know it sounds harsh but as someone who breeds and cares for hatchlings, it takes over your life for a couple months and is not cheap. 5 mealies a day, for 10 hatchlings, you'll be going through 350mealies a week, before they even hit juvenile age(0 a day as juvis), which you should really keep them til(15g) to make sure they're stable. Also it's super hard to find anyone willing to care for them so going away isn't really possible either..so you can keep em, but just know it's quite the commitment and if they're normals you'll be giving them away.   If you want to keep them though, you'll need an incubator, 82F if you want to hatch females, 88 if you want to hatch males. They have egg trays you can buy, put some hatching mix in the bottom, then the tray on top, make sure the mix is moist but not soggy. you may have to add a little water once a week or so. but I wouldn't over do it, to much can make them mold, but low humidity makes them dent, as long as they aren't starting to dent you should be fine. You can use a flashlight to ""candle"" the egg, if you see red veins that means they're fertile.  If you animals also don't have a humid hide, you should get one, they should have a humid hide anyways, tupperware bin with a hole cut in it, some moss or eco earth works well. I'd also ditch the walnut shells asap, the way they're crushed they're actually left with very sharp edges. If you animal swallows them they can cut up their innards. I'd switch to paper towel, tile, or repti-carpet, it's much safer. If you have anymore questions let me know, sorry if I'm rambling..I just woke up and I'm still kind foggy so I could've totally missed a question.."

leopardgeckos,35cri0,Herherpsnderps,2,Sat May 9 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I just felt bad because a lot of people take it offensive when I tell em the not so fun part of it, but I kinda wish someone had warned me. Even after a couple of seasons when my rack is filled with babies I have moments of ""oh god what have I gotten myself into"" but I love them and get over t. But it def can be overwhelming if your unprepared for it. It was nothing like I thought, so much stress over all the little delicate bodies. But they are fun. One thing you could do is crush most of the eggs and hatch out one or two, that'd be more manageable on time and money"
leopardgeckos,35cri0,Candlepup,1 point,Sat May 9 20:00:50 2015 UTC,"When and from where did you get your leopard gecko? If it was recent and she came from a colony of mixed males and females, treat the eggs as though they are fertilised, because there's a good chance that they are. There are many guides online to making incubators for leopard gecko eggs.  Do you keep her with a male, or has she been in contact with a male recently since you've had her? If not, and you know she was not around males before you bought her, it is safe to assume that these eggs are slugs and do not need to be incubated."
leopardgeckos,35cri0,Candlepup,3,Sat May 9 05:03:04 2015 UTC,"I have 2 geckos that I keep together, and now I know 1 is female and not sure about the other one.  I've had them for about 7 months, and theyve been in the cage together since"
leopardgeckos,35cri0,Candlepup,1 point,Sat May 9 06:00:35 2015 UTC,"Okay. Here's what you do.  Pick up the gecko that you don't know the sex of and gently turn it over and look at its cloaca. Males' cloacas have hemipenal bulges, which are basically just bumps where their hemipenes are when not in use. Additionally, they have these pore looking things in the shape of a chevron or V just above the cloaca. Both males and females have these, but they are much more pronounced in males.  If it turns out to be a male gecko, congratulations! You will soon have a bunch of tiny baby geckos. I would recommend moving the male to a different enclosure so this doesn't happen by surprise again."
leopardgeckos,35bstp,KokayneCowboy,2,Fri May 8 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"You really don't want to buy from someone that is able to hold weekly leo auctions. If a company has the capacity to auction animals off weekly then they are probably the size of a reptile wholesaler, aka. the people that sell to petco. Why pay shipping costs for animals of the same quality you can get at the store? If you are looking to get into higher quality breeder animals, then there are breeder facebook pages the hold auctions but not on any regular schedule. What exactly are you going for?"
leopardgeckos,35bstp,Etsecla,2,Fri May 8 22:06:11 2015 UTC,I specifically mentioned ACReptiles because they have weekly breeder quality auctions for crested geckos. If there was any company as reputable as them in the Leo business then I'd like to find them.
leopardgeckos,35bstp,Etsecla,2,Fri May 8 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"Ok so you're going for higher end stuff. SaSobek reptiles is really the only high end one that does auctions semi-regularly (about once a month). Luxurious leopards has occasional auctions as well. Gourmet rodent, the massive wholesaler that supplies most pet stores has started doing auctions too, but their animals aren't breeder quality and you won't get complete genetic information. They're also gross so please don't give them your money :)"
leopardgeckos,35bstp,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 8 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say breeders like sasobek, but if you're doing auctions for a cheaper price for a well bred animal, honestly, mid range breeders are a better way to go, you can get really nice animals for a lower price because they aren't as well known. Breeders that have have enough high end leopards to sell on auctions are usually well know and people are willing to pay a lot more for their animals. Hell I've seen sasobek sell off a couple guys that looks like mine and had same genetics for 2x more. He's basically famous in the leopard world though."
leopardgeckos,35asct,not_as_i_do,5,Fri May 8 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"Its important for her to feed the gecko. It is unhealthy for the gecko to not eat for almost two weeks, you don't want its presently healthy condition to waste away while you are gone. And when you get back, feeding it after it has been in a state of starvation could cause it issues if it eats too much too quickly. It may not even want to eat at all. If your mother in law is unwilling to take proper care of the gecko, it is imperative for you to find someone who will. Check with locally-owned pet stores (not chain stores, Smart or otherwise) to see if they board animals, or a local veterinarian. If they don't do boarding, its possible that they have a  tech or an employee that may be willing if you offer to pay them. But you can't just leave the gecko to its fat stores for two weeks and hope for the best. Its just not fair or humane, and it could permanently harm your gecko."
leopardgeckos,35asct,KritterKeeper,1 point,Fri May 8 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought about boarding the lizard. I'll look into that. If she would be willing to feed it worms with tweezers, would that be enough? Or do I need to feed crickets, too? Noob question, I know...Thanks. I've never had to leave the lizard for more than a few days, where I knew it was fine. I know our petsmart actually has a gentleman who owns several lizards and is getting a degree to work with lizards, I'm betting he'll board if I need to. Thank you for your advice!"
leopardgeckos,35asct,KritterKeeper,1 point,Fri May 8 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"It would be fine if she fed her just worms while you are gone, as long as you get back on crickets when you get back. Worms are pretty high in fat, low in nutrients, and they have a high phosphorus content, which makes it hard for geckos to absorb calcium. But in a short term situation, or as an occasional treat, they are fine. I hope you can find someone to take care of her while you are gone! Or at least convince your boyfriend's mom to feed her worms. Good luck!"
leopardgeckos,35asct,kmzacks,6,Fri May 8 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe find a couple of tiny plastic containers with lids (like shot glass size or smaller), and put 3-4 worms and medium in each. Then all she has to do is open the cup, dump the worms and pitch the cup.  That would probably minimize the ""ick"" factor on her part."
leopardgeckos,35asct,kharasmatic,2,Fri May 8 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"Whenever I go out of town I use this technique, and I also buy ""bug boxes"" from Petsmart.  Just punch a hole in be perforated box and set in cage, no touching of bugs needed. (I know you are generally not supposed to leave uneaten bugs in the cage, but on my personal experience I have found the bugs will go back into the box to hide/for food and leave the gecko alone.  I sometimes also drop a bit of carrot in the cage just in case, to ""distract"" the crickets.)"

Once we had to go away last second so my typical reptile guy couldn't watch them. I had a friend wgho was squeemish watch them instead, so what I did was fill a little plastic cup with 10-15mealworms so all she had to do was dump the cup into the bowl in the enclosure. I kept them in fridge so they'd stay better, but this way she never had to touch them. Mealworms are quite safe and you don't have to worry about them biting your gecko if left in the enclosure to long, which if she's working with crickets may happen. Mealworms are def safe to feed as well, it's actually the main staple of most breeders."

leopardgeckos,34thbr,like_mike,4,Mon May 4 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear your new gal is doing so well! The tank looks awesome, the only remendation Id make is changing out the calcium sand between the tiles to regular sand, I'm guessing that's what's up in the back right corner as well.  Calcium sand promotes them to lick it, and they actually use calcium carbonate for the calcium in it, which, when mixed with liquid hardens like cement. So Id avoid using it as impaction risk with calcium sand is far higher than just normal sand.   Otherwise everything looks great and your little gal is adorable. Leo's when tamed down make amazing and shockingly friendly pets. I have a couple breeders I've had for awhile that run right over when I open up their tub"
leopardgeckos,34thbr,Herherpsnderps,3,Mon May 4 14:14:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   I'll remember that and the next chance I get I'll put some regular sand down.

You've been a great help, I really appreciate it!"

leopardgeckos,34rh1c,SpeedyClaxton54,3,Sun May 3 22:46:36 2015 UTC,"I would advise against keeping two geckos in the same tank, but it could work if both female. Maybe separate the tank into two 20 gallon spaces with a mesh screen between them to see how they are with each other and get them use to each other? That is if you're willing to risk it.  I currently have 3 hides. A cool hide, a warm hide, and a humid hide. I keep the humid hide on the warm side with a plastic container top covering the bottom and a spare cloth in there that I spray with water daily.   I also have a uth heater on the warm side that is connected to a little device which I forget what is called, but will add later, that I can pick a heat that the uth is allowed to go up to but once it gets hotter it automatically shuts off. Its pricey, $50 and not necessary but mine was heating to over 110 degrees so it was needed.   I use just plain repti carpet and have a bowl for strictly pure calcium, since D3 poisoning is possible if too much is taken. I also have a small dish for water that I change daily.   Feel free to ask any questions :)"
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,2,Mon May 4 00:13:27 2015 UTC,"A bowl of straight calcium? I know you should guy load their food, but why a calcium bowl?"
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,3,Mon May 4 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"I do it for two different reasons. The first one is that geckos do need a healthy dose of calcium, and if my gecko feels like he needs more then he has a bowl right there in his tank to go get some.  It is also out of slight paranoia that I have because I got my first gecko from a friend but had to put her down after only having her for 5 days because she received a severe nutritional fracture from having metabolic bone disease. So I get a bit picky about giving my current gecko lots of calcium."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,dontcryferguson,1 point,Mon May 4 00:49:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds good I will also probably do that. And sorry another quick question, what exactly is gut loading? Do most pet stores do it? Do you store you crickets/mealworms somewhere and feed them daily? Again sorry for all the questions just trying to expand my knowledge."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,dontcryferguson,2,Mon May 4 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"Gut loading is feeding the insects something nutritious before feeding them to your gecko. Think of the bugs as cases for the food you put inside of them for the gecko. Greens, carrots, sweet potato, and other veggies are all good choices. I also keep my feeders (primarily worms...hate crickets) on a substrate of flukers cricket food, fortified with calcium,  just to cover my bases.   Unless your gecko is under a year old, they don't need to eat every day; ours eat every third day or so, and have gone up to a week. As long as their tail is fat, they're doing just fine and don't need to eat much. When you do feed the gecko, ours eats about 8 mealworms or phoenix worms per feeding, as an adult. He ate about 4-6 each day as a baby."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,1 point,Mon May 4 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"Do you provide the greens, carrots, etc, for the worms as well as gut loading/covering them in calcium? Does a mealworm only diet wok for Geckos, I hateeeeeeee crickets."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,2,Mon May 4 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"Providing the vegetables for the insects is the definition of gut loading, and yes, I also dust them in calcium powder. Reptopashy (sp?) Is my favorite because it also is a multivitamin in addition to having calcium. It also smells nice, though not sure the geckos care.  As with anything reptiles,  there is some debate about insects types to feed, but I am aware of many breeders who exclusively feed mealworms, and the geckos do just fine on them. You can keep them in the fridge to extend their shelf life, but do take them out once a week to gut load them all and let them thaw out for 24-48 hours before putting them back in the fridge. Ours took a long time before they started turning into beetles...something like 3-4 months. And by then there were less than six left anyway.   I'd get 50 to start out to see how much your gecko is going to eat; the younger it is, the more you will need sooner. As I mentioned,  rainbowmealworms.com is my favorite source since we got 500 for $10. You can go the pet store route, but box stores like petco/pets mart often have poor quality, where most of them are dead. These are prepackaged and precounted. Other petstores specialising in reptiles will raise their own feeders, but here ours charged .10 a worm! So we paid $10 for 100. They were def. Better quality than the box store's though.    You can keep the mealworms in a Tupperware container, lined with cereal or oatmeal or other grain so they have something to munch on. Give apples or carrots or whatever for moisture,  but don't leave anything perishable in there if you put them in the fridge (it will go uneaten and get moldy).   Trust me, I hate crickets too. We got them ONCE as a treat for the lizards, and NEVER again. My geckos have done well on mealworms and are very healthy."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,dontcryferguson,2,Mon May 4 03:24:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for all of your advice, I feel a lot more comfortable in moving forward and getting these geckos I will defiantly check out that website! I am going to go the meal worm route"
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,dontcryferguson,2,Mon May 4 03:39:53 2015 UTC,"Its okay! :)  I store crickets in a 20 gallon storage tub. I have a mesh screen over it and inside I have a few egg cartons and an empty toilet paper roll with one end with closed off with paper towels. I do this because the crickets like dark places and they'll just hangout in there making grabbing them much easier. It also works as a scooper. They also have a dish for food and a dish for Flukers cricket quencher(which is just what I use, you can use any brand). Crickets are incredibly stupid and will drown in any water source you give them so I usually just get those quenchers but there are different things you can use. For food I generally throw oatmeal, high quality cat food, any spare veggies and fruits, and calcium powder.   For mealworms I keep them in a Tupperware container with a black piece of paper covering the top(with air holes). I give them oatmeal to burrow in and give them fruit and veggies to eat and get water from.  And gut loading is where you feed, whatever you're about to feed your crickets, veggies and fruits and anything else healthy because insects, though great for protein, are pretty lacking in everything else nutritionally. And since leopard geckos eat only insects, to get all those nutrients the insects need to be fed nutritious food around 24 hours before(but I usually keep the food in there all the time) so they can eat the food.  Feed your geckos as much as they can eat in 15 minutes and once those are over remove all crickets or mealworms. Crickets especially can cause lots of problems including biting your gecko, harassing it, and eating your geckos poop risking your gecko getting sick from parasites if the gecko then eats the cricket."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,Miss_bone,1 point,Mon May 4 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"Oh god, listen I am a big man but crickets make me squeamish.. Can I do a diet with only meal worms or no? I am not used to storing crickets I am attuned to buying a dozen or a half dozen from my local pet store and throwing them in the tank. I don't know how my family would feel about storing crickets. Is there any way around that? I mean I will eventually be able to man up and do it if need be but if there are alternatives that'd be great."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,2,Mon May 4 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"I believe you could just feed your gecko mealworms as long as you gut feed them well(though that's true for any food source). People just prefer crickets because they have thinner exoskeletons making digestion easier. I'll usually switch back and forth between the two to provide variety, after all we'd get sick of eating the same food ALL the time.   And I strongly dislike the crickets. I hate touching them or acknowledging them and every now and then one will get loose. It'll die in a few weeks and will not breed unless in a very very humid environment which is likely not to be provided in your home. I usually use the toilet paper roll I mentioned earlier to quick scoop them up, throw a dash of calcium powder in there, and cover the other end with another paper towel, shake it, and then let it out into the tank. It usually works well so that no physical contact is needed with the crickets."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,dontcryferguson,1 point,Mon May 4 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"I might have to take your approach to handling them if I end up getting them, I might just take the mealworm approach and see how it goes."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,dontcryferguson,2,Mon May 4 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"One of my guys was a rescue and came to us with MBD. We were able to halt it before it got bad, but as result he will forever have a gimpy arm. Because of this,  we always ensure he has a plastic bottle cape (like a coke bottle cap) of calcium if he needs it. And I have witnessed him taking a few licks. When feeding him, I will also drop the worms in the cap to be sure he's getting all the calcium he needs!   It's just something very easy to do that can prevent a lot of problems."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,dontcryferguson,1 point,Mon May 4 01:30:57 2015 UTC,Do you also coat the worms in it? Do you feed them crickets as well or just worms? And also when do you feed? The same time everyday? Sorry for all the questions :/ want to pick everyones brain.
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,2,Mon May 4 01:54:35 2015 UTC,"We are happy to answer questions in hopes of having more geckos with happy, healthy homes. No worries.   I drop the worms in the calcium bottle cap and roll them around a little, so yes, they are a bit dusted.   I hate crickets and don't keep them. They make noise, are dirty, have short life spans, and are jumpy and a pain to recatch if your gecko isn't interested. You shouldn't leave them in with the gecko because they will bite the lizard or really irritate them. I only feed worms because they are far easier to keep. We do small superworms, mealworms, and phoenix worms, for variety. All don't make noise and are easy to care for, in my opinion. A lot of others are fans of Dubia roaches, which are great if you can get a colony going, but can be expensive otherwise. We live in an apartment, so really don't have a good place to start a colony. Maybe in the future though.    You can visit rainbowmealworms.com for very affordable prices on a variety of insects to see what you and your gecko like best. I usually spend about $15 every other month for our two geckos and bearded dragon this way.   I feed usually in the evening when they are just starting to wake up,  so between 7 and 10 pm. They will try to get my attention to let me know they're hungry! And ands I said before,  our geckos and see both adults, so we feed every 3rd day or so."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,1 point,Mon May 4 02:15:36 2015 UTC,"Okay so I can just do meal worms, good to hear cause I am not a fan of crickets at all lol. Do you just store meal worms in like a small one gallon aquarium thing? Will they eventually not be worms and turn into beetles? If you can tell I am not a bug fan whatsoever."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,x_falling_x,2,Mon May 4 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"that is connected to a little device   I'm assuming this is a thermostat/rheostat.   It cuts the mat off when it hits the set temperature, then kicks it back on so it maintains a steady temperature.  I can't preach enough about these things, you'd be surprised how hot a UTH can get uncontrolled."
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Wed May 6 06:27:59 2015 UTC,I agree. Its completely worth the money. My uth was going over 110 degrees. Unless you want to risk a crispy gecko I recommend getting one.
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Wed May 6 07:31:58 2015 UTC,"Do you also use heat lamps and if you do do you use a night lamp and a day light with specific lightbulbs? Also what do you do for hides, like the generic plastic hides or like the half logs of coconut shells?"
leopardgeckos,34rh1c,Herherpsnderps,2,Mon May 4 01:00:10 2015 UTC,"While some use lamps, I'd say the majority of gecko owners choose not to, as they tend to be unnecessary if you keep your home around 75+ degrees. We live in CO, and have never had issues needing anything other than an UTH to keep the warm side appropriately warm. They are nocturnal creatures, so ours usually never come out when lights are shining on them anyway.   For hides, do what works for you. Plastic Tupperware with a hole cut out is fine, but my husband likes having the geckos on display,  so prefers more natural looking hides. Our moist hide is a clay cave looking thing with paper towels in it that we spritz every other day, our normal hide is a log facing left and right, and our warm one is a fake stone structure that is pretty spacious underneathe. But you could just use 3 Tupperware containers, and it would be fine."
leopardgeckos,34p30b,stevenhawkingaloogie,2,Sun May 3 06:24:33 2015 UTC,"Aberrant albino, Id guess it was a bell by the coloration. However unless you find out straight from the breeder you can be for sure if it's bell or tremper, sometimes if they're incubated oddly trempers can look like bells and vise versa."

leopardgeckos,34p30b,kaa1,1 point,Sun May 3 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"eh, once they're out of the hatchling stages its much harder to tell. Bells have silver irises as well, as babies they are a much brighter red, almost hot pink. (O've bred both bells and albinos, adult eyes aren't very different, only the little guys)"
leopardgeckos,34p30b,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sun May 3 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"He's probably about 7-9 months.  He's with my sister right now, not with me, so I don't have a picture of his eyes specifically.  I believe she said the eyes seem red-ish around the pupil and the iris is silver-gold."
leopardgeckos,34ph43,lepruhkon,4,Sun May 3 10:46:59 2015 UTC,"I will suggest placing your moist hut closer to heat. Cold and damp do not mix well with Leos, it may be that he is just nervous of his new terrarium and wants to hide until he gets a chance to explore privately."
leopardgeckos,34ph43,zeflind,0,Sun May 3 11:11:58 2015 UTC,"I was sort of thinking the same thing, but most of the advice I've seen says to put the moist hide on the cool side of the tank. I also don't want to risk mold spores by having a warm, moist area"
leopardgeckos,34ph43,Herherpsnderps,2,Sun May 3 11:17:33 2015 UTC,"Whata the temp of the hot side? The moist hide should be more in an 80-85f spot, between the hot and cool side a bit"
leopardgeckos,34ph43,Herherpsnderps,-5,Sun May 3 11:59:36 2015 UTC,"Floor temp on the hot side is about 107-110F.  She has a little multi level house she can climb that hovers around 90-100, depending on which level you're on. Air temp hovers around 80.  We're only heating with the UTH for now, but we also have a ceramic bulb. I just put it on and I'll see what happens."
leopardgeckos,34ph43,RavingGerbil,6,Sun May 3 12:08:31 2015 UTC,"Oh wow..yea that's why, thats waayyyy to hot. It should never go over 95. She's staying in the cool side because the hot side will burn her. You'll need to get a thermostat for the  uth asap, most big chain pet stores sell them.  Do NOT put that ceramic on unless you want a fried leopard. With reptiles hotter isn't always better, heat over 95 can really stress them out. 75 cool side and 90 hot side is what they want."
leopardgeckos,34ph43,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sun May 3 12:17:08 2015 UTC,Hello. I'm not op but I am having a similar issue with my uth.  I have never seen what you're talking about and have looked at my two local stores.  Do you think you can find one online and post a link? I have been unplugging and replugging as needed but that is not a good way to do it. Thanks in advance!
leopardgeckos,34ph43,RavingGerbil,1 point,Sun May 3 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"Oh no worries! I found one that should be at petco but also for temporary use you can get a light dimmer. the only problem is you have to spend a couple hours watching the temp to set it and then make sure the button never gets bumped from that spot. But any kind of reptile thermostat will usually work, they do have some cheaper ones on Amazon I believe."
leopardgeckos,34ph43,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Sun May 3 15:56:40 2015 UTC,That looks great. I will go to petco and ask for this specifically. Thanks!

leopardgeckos,34nezv,_Foraii_,3,Sat May 2 19:27:00 2015 UTC,Honestly just a basic silicon seal works well and may hold better. Mod pod holding up a background may be to weak

leopardgeckos,34hhhn,Geckothrowaway2,2,Fri May 1 04:45:10 2015 UTC,If you can get him to hold still cotton buds dipped in some warm water work great. You need to be persistent though. Working from the edge of the skin inwards.
leopardgeckos,34hhhn,haobabidi27,2,Fri May 1 07:55:15 2015 UTC,I have done this with my gecko and it works well.
leopardgeckos,34hhhn,SunAds5274,1 point,Fri May 1 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"Id mist his head as much as possible. Also there's a product cAlled shed ease you can find at most box stores that's fairly cheap that may help. Id even say to mist his entire Enclosure for a day or two, so he has the higher humidity for the shed. Just be careful not to do it for more than a couple days as extended periods of high humidity aren't geat. But a short period should help get that off"
leopardgeckos,34hhhn,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 1 12:32:45 2015 UTC,"You could try a sauna. Get a tupperware container and put in a bit of warm water- not enough to cover his head or anything. If he lays down, it shouldn't cover his nose. Close the lid and let him stay in that for a bit- the humidity should loosen the skin up. After that you can try the q-tip thing or put him back in his humid hide."
leopardgeckos,34gxmb,CookieOmNomster,3,Fri May 1 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"He was full length before he was 2 years, but it took almost until he was 3 before he filled out weight wise."
leopardgeckos,34gxmb,Rustedbones,1 point,Fri May 1 04:00:13 2015 UTC,Thank you! Good to know. Mine will be 5 months old soon and he's at 6.5 inches nose to tail. I'm so excited for him to keep growing. :)
leopardgeckos,34g1g3,Gearsofhalowarfare,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"It's a male and he's a super hypo, the tail is def a bit thin. Although periods of not eating are actually not normal. Transportation or habitat issues are the only they should not eat for awhile, but theres always a reason."
leopardgeckos,34g1g3,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, okay. I've been feeding him as much as he will eat to be honest, which usually works out at about 6-8 crickets every other day. He'll often eat a few then go back into his hide while there's still more running about. He's almost completely uninterested in mealworms so they're no good either."
leopardgeckos,34g1g3,Onikrex,1 point,Fri May 1 00:23:10 2015 UTC,"Please be sure not to leave crickets running around his cage. I know it seems harmless but crickets are heartless little bitches.   They'll gnaw wound onto your Leo which can become infected. Its best to feed him a smaller amount so you  know he eats them, or move him into a container where the crickets can't hide, and you can remove him once he's full."
leopardgeckos,34g1g3,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 1 12:21:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard that before so I've made sure not to. The longest I usually leave crickets in is for about an hour, anything he hasn't eaten within that time I take out."
leopardgeckos,34g1g3,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 1 12:57:25 2015 UTC,Hmm does he normally only stay in one hide?
leopardgeckos,34g1g3,Herherpsnderps,1 point,Fri May 1 12:23:38 2015 UTC,Not really. He spends probably 50/30/20% of the time in the hot/humid/cool hides respectively.

leopardgeckos,34fdkk,Terra277,-2,Thu Apr 30 18:16:22 2015 UTC,Because I keep and this season started breeding leopard geckos. Then my pet only bird goes and shows up the lizards. It was humorous and I thought I'd share. Excuse the fuck out of me.
leopardgeckos,34fdkk,Onikrex,3,Fri May 1 07:28:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think that attitude is needed, man. He was polite to you and even said congratulations, he just asked the question everyone here was wondering."

leopardgeckos,34apef,TallCoolDrinkOWater,5,Wed Apr 29 17:22:23 2015 UTC,I usually just toss em on my shoulder or hand them to my husband. Critter keepers work too!
leopardgeckos,34apef,Herherpsnderps,3,Wed Apr 29 19:44:44 2015 UTC,When I clean my wee guy's tank I let him climb on the couch. He usually climbs up to the top and sits the whole time I'm cleaning. I've had him a few years though so we're used to each other.  If yours is young or new to you a box with his hide in it should be fine. Just leave cleaning the hide to last.
leopardgeckos,34apef,haobabidi27,3,Wed Apr 29 17:47:29 2015 UTC,I just put my gecko in a plastic container with a hide when I clean his tank.

leopardgeckos,34apef,kharasmatic,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:11:36 2015 UTC,I put him in a larger Tupperware container with holes in the lid
leopardgeckos,348que,RavingGerbil,4,Wed Apr 29 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"Climbing isn't abnormal, and these geckos are quite resilient against falling. He's climbing with his claws, and is unlikely to get a toe stuck in there. Double-check your temps and such to make sure he's not trying to ""get away"" to a better temperature. Use your best judgement, though."
leopardgeckos,348que,boa249,3,Wed Apr 29 15:14:20 2015 UTC,They aren't really skilled climbers and I'd honestly be more worried about him falling on something and hurting himself. I'd just keep an eye on him if he continues this
leopardgeckos,348que,collypin,2,Wed Apr 29 11:48:53 2015 UTC,"I have the same cage and I catch my leo climbing on that all the time. I've checked her toes and haven't seen any cuts/bruises. She's climbing that at least every other night, probably looking for a way out. luckily her legs don't reach the tank's covered mesh.  pic"
leopardgeckos,348que,jr49,2,Wed Apr 29 15:48:07 2015 UTC,I have those lizard ladder things in my leopards enclosure and my two girls are totally fine. I put a hammock at the top for them to climb up to and they love it. I also have some higher platforms near the hammock so they can climb down but sometimes they will just jump. They are hardy little things and have never been hurt with their adventures.
leopardgeckos,348que,Sweetsmyle,2,Thu Apr 30 14:37:47 2015 UTC,As he gets older and fatter he won't do this anymore. I once found a young leopard gecko hanging completely upside down from the screen lid. Id say there is very little risk of injury.
leopardgeckos,346ux7,Onikrex,6,Tue Apr 28 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"I feel you, I also worked for a corporate pet store (still do) and the horror stories keep piling up. I've refused sales several times (luckily I have good managers go back me up) on people who don't want to get the proper equipment to care for their animals. I went through a similar situation a few months ago with a friend of a friend keeping a red eared slider in a kritter keeper with no filtration, light, basking spot... I managed to convince them to give it up for adoption through a reptile rescue website.  Hopefully you can convince this person to do the same.... Good luck. I totally empathize with your situation. People suck."

I always tell them get it, make sure it works, get the tank up to temp... It's difficult to get people to understand the nitrogen cycle and why it's important for them to have tanks set up well in advance. I have also denied people the sale of a bearded dragon if they refuse to buy a uvb for it. A lot of people try to skip that and don't realize the expense.  Usually I try to refer people to a pet with a less expensive setup if they're just trying to cut corners on pet care to save $, but I do warn them that even a betta is going to be $50+ at the bare minimum."
leopardgeckos,346ux7,kharasmatic,2,Sat May 23 22:16:29 2015 UTC,"Then why did they get it if it's ""just a lizard""?! Why does anyone think it's okay to not properly care for animals because they don't complain about it?"

leopardgeckos,346ux7,boa249,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:10:06 2015 UTC,I don't understand. It doesn't cost that much to keep a leopard gecko happy compared to a dog or a cat. It bring me joy to know my lizard is happily sleeping all day. I don't understand these people.
leopardgeckos,3482r6,erika_bearika,4,Wed Apr 29 01:19:00 2015 UTC,It looks like he may have dropped his tail at one point and is in the regrowing process. What he has is nice and plump though... Keep doing what you're doing and it will slowly keep growing and looking more normal.   Edit: I wanted to add this link to a YouTube video of a Leo's tail regeneration.  http://youtu.be/KXbV3x4PgXc
leopardgeckos,3482r6,kharasmatic,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:04:17 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reassuring answer!
leopardgeckos,3482r6,Onikrex,2,Wed Apr 29 02:08:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, /u/kharasmatic  got it correct.   You leo dropped his tail at one point. It will grow, but I don't believe it will ever look ""normal"". It will always have that odd shape resembling their head.   To avoid him dropping his tail in the future always be careful when you hold him. Give him some ample warning before scooping him up. I always like to tap the glass when my hand is inside the tank, then let him lick my finger. Then I scoop him up.   Never hold him by his tail and avoid getting him too stressed when holding him.   Other than that, just keep going with what you're doing and enjoy your new friend :]   If you have any questions please let us know!"

leopardgeckos,345f3x,brahelp24,4,Tue Apr 28 14:47:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a lot of new owners are told that calcium sand is fine. However, in order to fulfill a need for calcium or when hunting for crickets, the gecko might start to ingest it and not be able to digest it. All that sand gets impacted in its little belly, and it dies a very painful death. By the time a gecko gets impacted, it's often already to late to do anything about it. A lot of people use tile (myself included). You can fill an entire tank with about 4$ worth of tile from Home Depot."

leopardgeckos,345f3x,brahelp24,2,Tue Apr 28 15:06:24 2015 UTC,Get something with texture. You don't want it to be too smooth or the gecko won't have any grip to walk.
leopardgeckos,345f3x,Herherpsnderps,2,Tue Apr 28 15:20:07 2015 UTC,"I used slate tile because it's easy to clean and looks natural. It's got enough texture to give my leo grip, but it's still smooth enough not to harbor bacteria. This is an old pic of my setup, just to give you an idea of how to do the tile. I cracked the square tiles with a hammer to give them a more natural shape and set them on a thin layer of sand. I have an under tank heater and a heat bulb on the left side so the tank stays a perfect temp at all times."
leopardgeckos,345f3x,Herherpsnderps,2,Tue Apr 28 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"Calcium sand has something in it that they need, so they lick it with purpose, much in the way they lick calcium powder. Unfortunately, calcium sand isn't digestable like powder, so they can get impacted and die. With normal sand they may only ingest when they're curious and walking around their tank (they lick the ground a lot)."

Leopard geckos are actually from an arid desert, which is all rock and hard packed sand, so they can get impacted by sand, it also hinders their shed, particularly on their toes, so many lose toes to bad sheds. Companies make it really hard for new owners by throwing a bunch of common reptiles like leopards on the bags of sand to get you to buy them. Tile is a better substitute. This is what I have one of my ex breeders in, a medium low exo terra like yours, with similar humid hide which he climbs easily in and out of! Just avoid any tiles with a very slick gloss as it becomes slippery for them.    Also here's a good caresheet I made up to give people who buy my geckos. It should explain some of the sand stuff as well some other points!   She may not be eating because if the temps are off, then she can't digest, and if she can't digest the food will rot in her stomach! These little guys are actually much smarter than people give them credit for, if they can't digest the food they'll eat to avoid later conflict. I would however avoid handling or interacting with her to much for a week or at least until she's had a couple of meals. stress can also lend itself to lack of appetite. I think I covered everything but if you have any other questions let me know! :)"
leopardgeckos,345f3x,quantumlizard,2,Tue Apr 28 15:16:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for all of your help. I just purchased 1/4 inch rough ceramic tile for the floor. Will that suffice if I use a UTH as well as my lamp?  edit: words
leopardgeckos,345f3x,greeneyedpopeye,2,Tue Apr 28 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"Depends, location house tell can differ. I always tell people that use whatever combo you can to get that 75 cool side and 90 warm side. Some people who live in warm regions or have a warm house only need a uth. But I'm from up north so while most of my guys are on a rack, when I do use a tank, I need a lamp as well because they're not in a warm reptile room.   Try the uth out and Id you need the lamp add it. Also it can vary between bulb wattage, if you find you need a bulb but ours is to warm, go down 25watts to the next bulb(most pet stores will let you exchange the bulbs within the week)"

But they're also in my area so the shipping is super fast. They have all the proper hardware and different size tapes to choose from"
