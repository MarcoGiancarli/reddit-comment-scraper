timetolegalize,3c7j59,ChrissiTea,2,Mon Jul 6 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"That's why they fired David Nutt when he was chief drug adviser. He stood for science and I am grateful to him for that. He also attempted to do more research on psychedelics yet was forbidden from doing so time and time again.  Another thing about those ""Cannabis based medicines"" is that most of them use synthetic cannabinoids on their own and haven't even been approved (I wonder why... spice is an attempt to synthetically emulate cannabinoids after all, and that's been proven horrible, for lack of a better word).   The one ""closer"" to the plant is marinol, which was approved and consists of synthetic THC alone, yet, it is the primary suspect of the death of 4 patients according to the FDA, whereas the use of the plant isn't the primary suspect of the death of a single person in recorded history.   But of course, governments value their money more than the people they are supposed to protect."
timetolegalize,3c7j59,Ruderalna,2,Mon Jul 6 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"What happened to David Nutt was disgusting, literally fired for doing his job and providing ""unsatisfactory results"" despite the fact that it's one of the best scales of dangerous-ness that I've seen.  I don't understand (other than the inability to patent a plant) why drug companies are so insistent on synthesising Cannabis/THC/CBD. As you noted, there are far more side effects (which can be lethal) with these synthesised drugs than with Cannabis. You can regulate your intake when smoking, vaping or ingesting, admittedly not to minute levels but if approached correctly it's easy to notice when you've had too much/not even get to that point in the first place.  I really hope Obama changes some federal law on his way out, moving Cannabis to a more suitable schedule and that more states get the massive influx of money that Colorado had so that the UK can have a serious discussion about Drug Reform, even if it's just from a capitalist stand point."
timetolegalize,3c7j59,ChrissiTea,2,Mon Jul 6 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and if you're having trouble self-titrating, it is fairly easy to adjust for that in a tincture, by adding more solvent for example. This is made easier under legality, where dispensaries can have liquid chromatography testing done in labs and tell you the percentage of different cannabinoids, flanonoids, terpenes, etc. that interest you the most for the effect you want.  I'm not surprised by big pharma's attempts, they are behind the DSM, and anything else that makes them money. When comparing the budget they spend on research to the massive amount they use for advertising, it makes me feel uneasy, and that's just the very tip of the iceberg as it is said.  I don't now about Obama. He said that it was not a priority for some reason I can't fathom, and also didn't do much when the previous head of the DEA would disobey anything said and keep cracking on cannabis to justify the DEA's existence. The White House recently eliminated one obstacle for medical cannabis research but although I really hope for it, I don't know if anything else will be done before the end of the term."

That increases the overall supply of the good causing.  The demand will also be effected, since people who previously stayed away will decide to partake.  But the risk of being a user is not the same as being a seller, so the loss of that risk does not have the same magnitude of effect on both sides.
