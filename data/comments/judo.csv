judo,3dzygi,NotTellingMyLocation,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"I train at the Tohoku in Somerville which which is an amazing place. You also have the Newton Judo Club but they only train Tues / Thurs I think? Jimmy Pedro has a school in the area I believe, maybe Waltham (or Watertown ? It starts with a W) if you need more I can provide after work. In fact, I'm going to train tonight if you want to come! :D"
judo,3dzygi,worldwarcheese,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I won't be able to make it tonight, sadly.  I used to fence, and after a few years I developed an understanding of all the different local clubs, like what each was best for.  There was the big juggernaut club, the one that was a kind of cult favorite where you could always pick up a good bout, the one that hosted excellent tournaments and did good training, but you'd be a little hard-pressed to find a good opponent, etc.  Do the local Judo dojos have the same kind of distinctions?"
judo,3dzygi,worldwarcheese,2,Tue Jul 21 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"Its tough because there's only a handful of schools and I've only been to a few. Most, if not all schools have competitors in local tournaments and some have added to the ranks of national or international Judo (most notable Pedro's as he was a bronze medalist in the Olympics and the head coach for the National Team). Tohoku is nice because it offers a serious level of quality as well as variety as each day of the week has a different instructor and focus (ex Thursday is newaza/groundwork days) and a lot of our students are visiting internationals which just creates a really unique environment IMHO. I only went to Newton once and it was years ago. I also went to Team Link Judo back when it was the Worcester martial arts club and it's excellently run with top level competitors and instructors as well. There may not be much judo in Massachusetts but what we do have seems to be high quality.   Pm me for  my contact info if you want or just drop by any of the schools anytime."
judo,3dzygi,worldwarcheese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I could deal with the chaos of Tohoku before I get my foot in the door.  Does it make sense to just show up somewhere?  If I do, will there be someone to tell me what to do?  I know almost nothing about Judo and only chose it because I like martial sports but dislike damaging people, and from what I understand, Judo is more about deflection than choking or pummeling."
judo,3dzygi,SuperDuckMan,2,Wed Jul 22 04:05:52 2015 UTC,Tohoku is not chaotic i promise and to get a sense of what classes are like the best thing is just to go and see one and try it out you'll never really know what the classes are like until you actually go to them. You don't even have to practice the first day you can just sit and watch :-)
judo,3dzygi,SuperDuckMan,2,Wed Jul 22 11:08:46 2015 UTC,"This may sound a little corny, but most (qualified) Judo dojos are beginner. Unless you are in a class that's training for some sort of big competition, most dojos are very accomodating to beginners. Most people are going to help you along, and not grind the new white belt (you) into dust."
judo,3dzygi,SuperDuckMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not too concerned about being ground into the dust.  It's just that some fencing clubs are better for practice than for lessons and some are the reverse.  Assuming Judo dojos are like that, which they may not be, I'd rather end up at a dojo that focuses on lessons and training rather sparring."
judo,3dzygi,SuperDuckMan,3,Wed Jul 22 03:55:21 2015 UTC,Sparring (randori) is a HUGE part of judo. There is no escaping it.
judo,3dzygi,rackcitytourismboard,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:19:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should put it this way: when I fenced, my favorite club ended up being one where you would just show up and fence.  They had lessons, but they were rare and were quite barebones.  The club was mostly for more experienced fencers who had developed beyond where group instruction would be particularly meaningful.  I enjoyed going there once I had been fencing consistently and frequently for five years, but had I gone there at first, I would have been lost.  I'd like to avoid that kind of place with a new discipline.  I don't even know the rules yet."

judo,3dxb24,SVPPB,2,Mon Jul 20 09:38:46 2015 UTC,I second Harai Tsuri Komi Ashi. It looks like magic to me...
judo,3dxb24,PartyPope,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple tbh. I actually use it frequently in competitions and randori. I often fish for a Kosoto-gari, but against some people Harai-Tsuri-Komi-ashi works a lot better for me. It's also good to do it before gripping, just charge towards the opponent (not running, but fast walk), grip the lapel and sweep his retreating leg.  I encourage you to watch this video. At the start he explains the importance of hip movement.  Mine, looks more like the version in this video, except that I use a traditional lapel and sleeve grip. Look at how he turns the foot inwards, this is especially good for learning the technique because it encourages you to really extend your leg diagonally forward instead of sideways."
judo,3dxb24,fleischlaberl,2,Tue Jul 21 09:01:41 2015 UTC,Hip Movement and hip tension are the key to almost every ashi harai/barai waza. Beside of excellent timing (debana).  .
judo,3dxb24,PartyPope,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"From my experience most people fail because their sweeping motion is garbage. When the motion is swift and smooth the timing is not that hard, especially because you can force the timing of a harai-tsuri-komi-ashi. So yeah, I absolutely agree with you, which is why I pointed towards the video."
judo,3dxb24,JoPBody,3,Tue Jul 21 14:27:20 2015 UTC,Hane goshi - I don't think I've ever seen it pulled off in randori or shiai except on YouTube

judo,3dxb24,PartyPope,2,Mon Jul 20 10:15:10 2015 UTC,"Hane goshi, is one of the least popular throws in competitive judo, but there are some really nice example. This is a recent one."
judo,3dxb24,bozo78,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:05:36 2015 UTC,That's quite something! Hanegoshi is an odd bloody throw; I'm terrible at it (knee issues) but I can see the appeal.   You would think HG would be more common in comp. Perhaps we will see a renaissance now that te-guruma is out.
judo,3dxb24,asdgen3456,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:32 2015 UTC,the times i have been able to pull of utsuri goshi was more of a counter attack. last time i did it the guy tried to do something like seo nagi but mid twist i kinda got in front of him and was able to throw him.

judo,3dxb24,ReddJudicata,2,Mon Jul 20 08:49:55 2015 UTC,I've always heard tai otoshi for the common competition throws.
judo,3dxb24,Judostu,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:36 2015 UTC,But when you time it right its a thing of beauty
judo,3dxb24,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"Why do you think yourself, that uchi mata is such a difficult throw?  Its the most common used and successful throw in competition beside seoi nage/otoshi and O soto gari.  Can it realy be ""so difficult"" when Uchi mata is used by a lot of competitors?  Uchi Mata - O Uchi gari - O soto gari (Hiza Guruma/Sasae/reverse Seoi) is a common game play /strategy.  ."
judo,3dxb24,Glitch_King_,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:18 2015 UTC,It's heavy usage by high level competitors in no way lessens the difficulty and complexity of the throw. Uchimata is widely considered to be very difficult because in order for it to be done correctly you have to be flawless. Can people put together a garbage throw that resembles Uchimata? Sure. But to really execute it properly takes a lot of skill in comparison to other throws.
judo,3dxb24,fleischlaberl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"Why is Uchi Mata widely considered to be a difficult throw?  I know, that it is considered as the ""king of throws"" but why?  Which skills are neccessary, to do an Uchi Mata flawless and properly?  ."
judo,3dxb24,Glitch_King_,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:11 2015 UTC,Because the kuzushi and technique is less forgiving than other throws.
judo,3dxb24,dzendian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:15 2015 UTC,"Why is Uchi Mata widely considered to be a difficult throw?   I would say that it's because in order to do it, you have to have a good tsuri komi goshi (which is also a nuanced throw), and a good bit of leg control and timing."
judo,3dxb24,Ryvai,2,Wed Jul 22 06:08:13 2015 UTC,"Uchi-mata actually requires a lot of you to understand, from a beginners perspective. Doing ken-ken uchi-mata or back-grip uchi-mata does not help you 'understand' how the technique really works, it's basically cheating yourself. It probably took me about 3 belts until I got uchi-mata to really work :p"
judo,3dxb24,fleischlaberl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:19:48 2015 UTC,"But I think its also some sort of technique, which is easy for the talented. And like in other sports you mostly dont have the talent for the whole sport. Some are talented for Te Waza, other for Ashi Waza and others for Koshi Waza. If you have long legs its natural, that you have a game with O soto gari, Uchi Mata, O uchi Gari and Hiza/Sasae. If you have a stocky build it could be much easier to go for seoi nage/otoshi. I do have troubles to go for a good clean seoi and do have troubles do perform a proper tsurikomi goshi, but uchi mata and most ashi waza coming just natural to me.  ."
judo,3dxb24,dermatix,3,Wed Jul 22 11:57:50 2015 UTC,Uchi mata. I've just recently been able to consistently throw people with it while static. Haven't gotten it in randori yet.  Tai otoshi is the hardest to get in randori for me.

judo,3dxb24,SVPPB,3,Mon Jul 20 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"I think that's not so much because of the difficulty, but more because the throw will only work when uke is a complete idiot or a non-judoka.  https://youtu.be/QvXjF1oadgk  Here's a video of a judoka winning an early MMA match thanks to sumi otoshi."

I took a first look and I gotta say though, I am somewhat disappointed, that they kept the explanation of Tsukuri over simplified. Kazuzo Kudo (Kodokan 9th dan) elaborated on the matter in ""Judo in Action"" and described that Tsukuri actually consists of Aite-no-Tsukuri and Jibun-no-Tsukuri. Also is the implied order of Kuzuhi-Tsukuri-Kake not an order at all. That's -again- a didactic simplification."

One of my sensei started when he was 24 and has been 6th dan for quite some time now, national coach and an excellent competitor himself, you name it. It's never too late.

The chokes are not dangerous or scary, particularly when you start as everyone will go gentle. As soon as you feel uncomfortable, tap.  As a fellow beginner, one tip I'd give you is to check out the grading syllabus for your country and start familiarising yourself with the first techniques and their names. Watch some videos and practice the footwork. It's so much easier to learn a new technique if you already know the basic principles.

The dojo etiquette is different from place to place, but generally you are safe if you bring zori or slippers for when walking off the mat. Bow on/off the mat and buy a white judogi. Bowing rituals usually goes as follows; everyone line-up (follow the dojo's system for rank), the sensei-side then kneels down to seiza (left leg, then right leg), other side follows, the senpai then shouts 'sensei ni rei!' then everyone performs za-rei (seated bow). Many places just perform the za-rei with no shouting. Some places bow to the kamiza, some don't. Just follow the class and you'll be fine :) You should definitely buy a judogi. Karategi will literally be ripped apart pretty fast.  You'll definitely have fun and learn tons of new stuff. Shotokan has deep stances if I'm not mistaken. This is not optimal for Judo, as the legs are susceptible for foot-sweeps. Try to narrow them a little, a bit further than shoulder width. Good luck!"
judo,3dnvla,Ryvai,3,Fri Jul 17 23:38:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Very helpful stuff. Yes, Shotokan has deep stances but in kumite, stances do tend to shorten up a fair bit to facilitate movement in all directions.  I have watched a few judo videos and can see glimpses of karate stances within the throws.  Really, stances should be treated as transitory positions for fighting and are mainly meant to teach one where to position their bodyweight.    I'll try to constantly remind myself to stay loose or ""soft"".  Thanks again."
judo,3dnvla,Anthony126517,4,Sat Jul 18 14:24:18 2015 UTC,"I'll answer some of your questions as best I can.  Training once a week might be hard to learn Judo. I came into Judo from a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu background and Crosstrain once a week. It's hard to learn but it's wroth it, you will learn a lot. Breakfalls,Throws & some groundwork (chocks & arm locks & pins)  Second, You will be right at home with the tradnational stuff it's pretty much the same as Karate. You bow a lot lol.  Third, you should get a Judo Gi because your Karate Gi will get recked."
judo,3dnvla,ApeUke,3,Fri Jul 17 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"My club does the following for etiquette: Everyone lines up in belt order with instructors opposite students We all bow, then are told to run. Same process at end of class.  Instructor is Sensei.  Get a judo gi, your karate one will NOT survive. I have 3 Fushida Gis and really like them. Toraki is also a really popular at our club (also Canadian)  Likely your first few classes will be around breakfalls."
judo,3dnvla,academicninja,3,Fri Jul 17 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"Once a week is better than 0 times a week. You won't progress quickly but you're obviously OK with that. Go for it.   Judo tends to be more informal. I've practice at many different clubs and there are subtle differences in what they say/do but its mostly the same (line up according to rank), seiza/clear mind, [attention], kneeling bow, up, bow, warm up.     Buy a judo gi. Your karate gi will get shredded the second you start being thrown.   Those are both fine gi's. I have had great luck with the cheaper HSU gi's. http://hsujudo.com/judoUniforms.html  Welcome to Judo. Don't forget your ibuprofen if you're not used to falling."
judo,3dnvla,nicekid81,2,Sat Jul 18 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"Well, it's pretty straightforward. In regards to going only once a week, what do you say to your students if they say that? It's not ideal but it beats nothing a week, no club can make you do otherwise. Does every karate club have the same etiquette requirements as each other? Nope, depends on the club. So why would it be any different with Judo clubs?"
judo,3dnvla,nicekid81,2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Having never been to a judo class, I don't think the answers to my questions are that obvious to a non-judoka.  I could make assumptions based on my previous experience, but instead I chose to find out for sure by asking you guys.    The main reason I asked about etiquette and sensei/senpai was all the websites I've seen don't really refer to the instructors as ""sensei"" but rather Mr. So-and-so.  Even here on this subreddit, on the side panel it says James Takemori.  A karate website would almost always refer to this person as Sensei, Shihan, or something like that.  On top of this, I do realize that Judo can be more sport-oriented, and in my experience what tends to happen when things go that way, is that the traditions and etiquette tend to get pushed to the wayside, whether to make it more accessible to the general public, or just because traditions became relaxed/ignored, if you will.  Anyway, it's good to know that things are pretty similar to what I am used to.  Thanks."
judo,3dnvla,N00t,2,Sat Jul 18 03:52:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I guess I have experience from the other end, where I was tried a bit of everything and ended up in Judo.  Anyhoo, it's really not too different than any other club for other sports/hobbies.  There's a standard guideline of etiquette, but as far as how far they run with it, it depends on the club."
judo,3dnvla,borrek,2,Sat Jul 18 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"Fellow Karateka/Judoka here. I just wanted to mention that much in the same way that a certain percentage of modern karate is focused on a competition format, as an Olympic sport Judo is even more geared towards it point competition by and large. If you are looking for nagewaza and newaza that can be easily applied to a karate foundation, it might be especially hard to find a dojo that suits your needs.   Certainly, no matter what happens, you are guaranteed to get something out of it, and I don't mean to discourage you in the slightest. I just wanted to share my experience."
judo,3dnvla,DocJude3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:10:27 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Was wondering if there were any karateka in here.
judo,3dnvla,dzendian,2,Sat Jul 18 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"I followed a similar path, from 20 years of shito-ryu to 9 years of judo. My dojo seems to be more formal than some of the others here. My instructors both trained at the Yokohama prefecture judo club and we follow the same structure. It never came across as stuffy to me, but for example we can't wear blue gis (same rules as the kodokan - which is kind of the home of judo) Some dojos will be formal and some will be less, but neither is indicative of quality. McDojos don't really exist in judo because there's no room for shams when you have to train with the level of resistance required in randori (free practice). An informal dojo can produce great players just as much as a formal dojo. Sometimes informal judo dojos get new players to sport success more quickly and formal dojos are more academic, finding success later after more study.   I think you can make progress once a week, but if you're anything like most other judo players, you'll love that moment you finally get a good throw so much that you'll start coming more and more.   Definitely get a new gi. I wore my expensive shureido karate pants as a backups when my judo pants ripped and the karate pants only made it through four classes. I wouldn't wear the jacket because it would be a goner in no time flat."
judo,3dnvla,goodbetterben,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome reply.  Thanks for your insight.  Being a traditional karate guy, I think I would have a hard time wearing a blue gi!  I guess those are more for competitions?  Do you still train in Shito-Ryu?  Did you find that Judo complemented your karate?"
judo,3dnvla,ckristiantyler,2,Sat Jul 18 04:35:53 2015 UTC,Toraki are great Judogi.  I have one and fully recommend them.
judo,3dnvla,dzendian,2,Sat Jul 18 05:51:28 2015 UTC,"Due to my schedule, I think I would only be able to attend one class a week. Do you guys think this would be okay?   Honestly, no.  Not in the beginning.  You should do the first couple weeks as much as you can.  Then after that you can be a casual.  You have to learn how to fall properly first.  I don't think it's wise to learn how to casually fall.  After you learn how to fall, you can be infrequent.   What is the dojo etiquette like in a Judo club?   Pretty much the same.  No usage of ""senpai"" though.  I would say that the formalities are all there, but aside from all of those it's usually pretty chill.   Starting out, can I just wear my karategi or should I buy a judogi before my first class?   Absolutely not.  Your karate gi will likely become torn after just one throw.  Good luck and welcome to judo!"
judo,3dnvla,fedornuthugger,3,Fri Jul 17 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree...you have been learning and studying the martial arts for a long time, and I would assume have learned and taken to heart many of the values shared by these arts.  If you are ok with spending a good portion of your time practising the very basics 1 class is definitely better than no classes."
judo,3dnvla,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:07:16 2015 UTC,I agree once a week is not enough for a begginer
judo,3dnvla,konungursvia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:10:02 2015 UTC,I agree.  I think much would be forgotten in between classes.  Falling right needs to be instinctual and learned as quickly as possible.
judo,3dnvla,JoeDwarf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:32:03 2015 UTC,Your Karate gi is most likely not robust enough for the push and pull of Judo. Judo Gi's are made much thicker since they get abused more. I would get another Gi or you might expect your karate gi to rip at some point.
judo,3dnvla,reviling,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone.  From the sounds of it, I'll definitely be ordering a judogi in the near future.  And as for training once a week, I'm afraid it is what it is.  I'll double-check with the instructor to make sure he's okay with that arrangement.  A lot of you are flat out telling me that I need two classes a week.  I get that I'm a beginner to judo, but I'm not a full-out noob.  I do have a pretty good understanding of body mechanics, timing and distancing from my karate training, and although I feel like I roll like a cinder block, I do have some ukemi experience.  I'll do my best to practice at home, until my situation changes.  I had one other question that came to mind.  I've heard that judoka are prone to knee injuries.  Is that true?  How many of you wear braces or have had surgery on your knees?  Anecdotally, would you say that you see more knee injuries happening to the high level competitors compared to the average joe kyu rank?"
judo,3dnvla,JudokaYasha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:30:35 2015 UTC,"Hi there, great to see you are interested in Judo. Cross training broadens the horizon and sometimes offers a new perspectivity on familiar things.   ... but I'm not a full-out noob.   This can be a problem actually. From my experience, karateka, who are new to grappling arts tend to be very ""rigid"". They have to make the transition from a hardness (""go"") based martial art to a flexibility (""ju"") based martial art. Might take some time to get used to after 25 years.   I've heard that judoka are prone to knee injuries.   Knee injuries can happen indeed, but they are not as common as one might think (I had one in 19 years of Judo and it healed mostly). Such injuries are usually the result of improper technique (I have to partially blame myself for my injury, but it was one of those things that made me carefully review my own technique after that). Since you have no intention to compete or any other urgent reason to push yourself beyond reasonable limits, I'd say go slow, learn carefully and properly, avoid the wild beginners as partners if possible and you should be on the safe side."
judo,3dnvla,skubasteve54,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would be okay, because your Karate experience will provide you with MUCH of the mental discipline, respect, etc. You will still learn much faster than the average student there. Go for it (Brown Belt, judo; Red stripe, Tae Kwon do)"
judo,3dnvla,twan55,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:44:59 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give you is to empty your cup, as the old saying goes. It will be hard to let go of your past experience, but try to treat the experience as a complete beginner. Some of the terminology will be the same, some different, some of the words will be the same but used differently. Use of sensei and sempai varies from dojo to dojo. One thing to note is the use of ""sempai"" as a generic term for a senior student is a western simplification of the concept.   And yeah, get a judogi, your karategi will get torn in judo practice."
judo,3dnclw,mltcrazy,3,Fri Jul 17 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"Good food and drinks, like cliff bars and water / Gatorade. I don't know if your kids would care at their age but I always ask my parents to not make a scene if I win and especially to not make a big deal if I lose. This won't apply to you yet but when the arm bars and chokes start happening do not freak out if your child is losing. I've seen moms and dads try to stop the fight when their child is being choked, like they walked onto the mat (with shoes) and was about to pull the kids apart. He got stopped by the instructors though."
judo,3dnclw,NastyWatermellon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:26:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. The chokes and locks are coming next month. They are also doing a BJJ tourney.
judo,3dnclw,dzendian,3,Fri Jul 17 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"I've been volunteering a lot for various parts of judo tournaments, including the kids.  Make sure your kids are wearing WHITE, legal, gis.  There should be a pile of community blue and white belts of different sizes if you forget to bring your own.  Don't freak out if your kid starts crying, there should be medics.  I've seen this happen a lot and I've never seen a serious injury.  Just minor ""ouchies.""  Try not to make your kids nervous beforehand.  Don't spoil the kids by bringing anxiety into it.  They should have some fun.  If it's their first tournament... be prepared for some losses.  My main takeaway from watching kids that young compete is: can they tie their belt and know which way their gi crosses?  Do they know how to bow onto the mat and the formalities involved with that?  Do they know when to start?  Do they know when to stop?  Kids usually go first at tournaments, especially 5-6 years old.  I wouldn't send them onto the mat full of liquids or food.  Could be a recipe for vomit.  I'd chill out on feeding them two to three hours before they compete and don't let them gulp fluids an hour or so before competing (more recipe for puke), only sip.  Hydration happens the day before, not the hour before.  edit: bring a variety of candy and sweets that they can suck on between matches or pools (if they need it), and definitely for after.  They've burned enough calories, they can have some candy."
judo,3dnclw,Ryvai,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:26 2015 UTC,"The most important thing to bring is; enthusiasm and support. The kids do this because it's fun. Just be proud of them, and don't be afraid to show it. Also, have fun yourself. Talk to the opponents coach or parents and have a good time. Absorb the atmosphere :)  It's a good idea to make sure they eat and drink properly. When we get nervous we have to go to the toilet, sometimes just before the fight, be prepare for that. Try to let the coach do the actual coaching, he/she probable knows your kids and what they should be doing :p"
judo,3dnclw,SuperDuckMan,0,Sat Jul 18 00:40:02 2015 UTC,"Don't get too nervous about if they win or lose, and if something bad is happening (injury, choke, armbar), don't go barrelling onto the mat, they have referees and medics."

judo,3di807,bozo78,4,Thu Jul 16 15:04:45 2015 UTC,"The people don't adjust to Ronda's standing, she simply starts facing better opponents. Circling left or right is the most basic game plan there is. Move against the opponents main throwing technique.  Clearly that will make the difference! Especially when her opponents aren't even in the same league physically and techniqually.  Once she gets a hold on them they are playing a Judo game and none of her opponents is even remotely competent in Judo, while Ronda probably competed in 300+ competitions.   Put Emane from the clip against Rousey and it's going to go full time. But that's probably not going to happen because the french don't give a shit about MMA."

If the guy has a similar level of skill or is even better than you, it can be senseless, if he does a 100% and muscles through you, but almost nobody does.  If you are better you can always compensate the difference in weight (maybe not completely). Moreover, it encourages you to set up your throws well and combine and use scary feints. I can only throw 81kg players if I move them and everything."

I worry slightly that when i enter competition when I face someone my own size I will have serious trouble adapting my technique to them.  however I can give you some insight from what I have experienced working with smaller judoka.  most other white belts and yellow belts that i work with have extreme difficulty throwing me unless I help them. however whenever I work with any black belts, they have no problem doing any technique on me, both tachiwaza and newaza.  In fact one of the best experiences that made me start really thinking about technique and much much less on just muscling my way through judo was when a black belt who was at least a foot or more shorter and at least 60kg lighter than me was able to toss me around like nothing in newaza when i just struggled to move him an inch. It was a both a great lesson and a humbling experience.   either way i would say there are definite benefits to working with people of all weight/height."

Take care of injuries in resisting a throw of a really heavy opponent, if he is halfway in.

judo,3djigx,Eilai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"I'm 64kg and I occasionally train with a 80+kg fighter. Training with heavier opponents allow for strengthening of your core and reinforces your techniques. The first aspect comes with resistance training and having to throw someone of bigger size and mass than you builds up your core to be able to stabilize yourself when grappling, something which could be essential in competitions. On top of that, it serves as a decent reevaluation of your technique. Being able to throw a heavier opponent relies in a proper understanding of the throws from start to end and also tests your ability to adapt.   All in all, while training with heavier opponents may be beneficial to you in many ways, you should not forget to train with people in your own weight range if you intend to take part in competitions."

I agree that a small tech (footsweep) is a good way to set up a big one (and vice versa)....but I wonder if it could be done mostly through taisabaki. If tori and uke are in a dynamic equilibrium and one moves, then the relationship between both has changed. That can be done via setting up uke or by having tori move. At that point, Sonnon (IOUF) talks about it being less about throwing him than throwing ""us"" (the 4 legged animal idea, where the front legs aren't coordinating with the back, so the whole animal trips over).   Just spitballin'"

You would use jabbing and threatening kicks to control the other person, set him in a trap.  It's much more tiring when you are not in control that's for sure."
judo,3dih07,Ryvai,3,Thu Jul 16 15:55:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's better to use happo-no-kuzushi a different way.

Additionally one should develop 2-3 tokui-waza that you can throw from most positions. You can make a technique-map for this. here's mine of my competition techniques :)"

judo,3dih07,ReddJudicata,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:30:15 2015 UTC,One way is from extreme ai yotsu.  Not sure I can find a video. You slip your leg behind uke and execute. He'll fall back. Sort of like tai otoshi moving sideways but even more extreme.  My coach does this. It's subtle.
judo,3dih07,pk618,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:37:06 2015 UTC,Look up o soto otoshi. Pretty much tai otoshi straight backwards.
judo,3dih07,Ryvai,2,Fri Jul 17 07:22:57 2015 UTC,That is kind of my point. Most techniques resembling tai-otoshi backwards become something else :p
judo,3dih07,pk618,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:54:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it fits the same movement pattern criteria, but gets a fancy new name headed backwards. If that doesn't meet your standards I doubt any throw would with in judo naming conventions."
judo,3dih07,Ryvai,2,Fri Jul 17 08:06:42 2015 UTC,"That is not my point. The concept of 8-directional unbalance is related to uke and I can't think of any technique at the top of my head which can be done in all directions. But you can do similar movements in all directions, e.g; uchimata forwards, harai-goshi sideways, o-soto-gari backwards, and so on :)"
judo,3dih07,ReddJudicata,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:03:16 2015 UTC,It's not osoto otoshi. It's executed as a hand throw.
judo,3di2vf,fleischlaberl,10,Thu Jul 16 13:20:15 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree.  Many clubs and associations seem to have simply forgotten the techniques almost overnight.  Sometimes, I'm talking with a guy from another dojo and mention morote gari, and I get a blank stare in return: ""but that's... gasp illegal!"".  We pay lip service to preserving leg grabs, but the truth is they are falling into disuse."

judo,3di2vf,bozo78,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:13 2015 UTC,There aren't enough competition organizations running Judo tournaments. Thus the main way to Shiai are IJF style tournaments. That's one aspect of it.
judo,3di2vf,JudokaYasha,2,Thu Jul 16 15:12:40 2015 UTC,Yes it's one aspect. But I speak of practice/randori in the dojo. Leg grabs are only prohibited in shiai - so you don't get hansoku make in randori for leg grabs.

Are they some sort of ""dangerous"" - thats why atemi waza, daki age, kani basami were banned in randori and competition but not! in practice and learning and some of them are part of Kata.

I'll give the other two, but these two are not. But if I wanted to do leg locks, I can do BJJ (or sambo); if I wanted to do striking, I can do MMA. You want to grab legs, you can find a dojo that allows that - you shouldn't be the jackass who goes to a dojo that does IJF judo and start grabbing legs because YOU want to."

If I really want to do that stuff, I'll find a BJJ or freestyle judo place nearby or ask my fellow dojo-mates to come early/stay late to do some unofficial stuff.

Get it, now?""  No, didn't get it. Why cant you do leggrabs in randori and follow the IJF rules in competition?  Its easy to do no leggrabs - you just don't do some kind of throws, some kind of defence and some kind of variations of throws or completing the throws.  Look at the most common throws in competition, which are successfull - you dont have to touch the legs in more than 90 percent of most common throws. So no big thing. Its also no big thing, if the one, who wants to compete, doesnt do any leg grabs and the partner does leg grabs, because he wants to learn to attack and defend with leggrabs. Leggrabs are no big thing in Judo and under 5 percent of technique (if you include defending, variations and completion of a throw) and not the best one. Its not like ""if you do no leg grabs you miss 50 percent of Judo).  If a dojo doesn't want to allow leggrabs in randori its okay. But I wouldn't do this giving BBJ and MMA silly arguments, that you cant grab the legs in Judo. You can grab the legs but its  inefficient if you try to do double leg takedown or single leg takedown. Its easy to defend and always was rare in high level competition. Why? Because they are not realy effective and easy to defend. And its very sad, if Judoka today, who learned Judo recently, can't defend against such simple attacks like morote gari. Why cant they defend? Because they dont learn attacking with and defending against leg grabs. Judo is giving away his reputation as an effective Martial Art, if you are getting smashed as a black belt by a mediocre BBJ or MMA player who droping in your Dojo,  and has simple no or little clue of nage waza, tai sabaki or shin tai nor shizen tai.  ."
judo,3di2vf,aronnax512,3,Mon Jul 20 08:38:21 2015 UTC,I feel like the people who make the rules don't even train and have no idea how it impacts majority of the dojos in the world.  I'm the guy who also gets upset when black belts don't engage in warm up. It's a bad example to the kids.

judo,3di2vf,onehungrybear,3,Fri Jul 17 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"Do you really do randori with IJF competition rules? Would only make some sense, if your club/dojo competes at national and international level.   It makes sense if your club competes in shiai at all. Even kids competing in small regional events use a modified form of the IJF rules.  I only see certain techniques practiced in kata and open mat, and even then, rarely."
judo,3di2vf,onehungrybear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"Kids should learn good upright Judo in natural posture first (shizen tai). You also dont teach children sutemi waza and makikomi waza in the first years. Also tani otoshi and ura nage comes later. You can teach them leggrabs, when they are 14 or 15 and then they are old enough to use them in randori only. Judo for children is not to make them very successful in shiai - they should learn well rounded Judo at first.  ."
judo,3di2vf,onehungrybear,2,Sat Jul 18 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"The reason you see such a strong reaction is due to substantial cultural differences.   In the US, Judo is seen as a sport and competition is seen as a natural component of any sport. For better or worse, children compete and having some measure of success in competition is what helps motivate them to continue. If you want them to stick with Judo you're going to have to devote a substantial amount of training time to preparing for shiai. We can idealize how children ""should"" learn judo but be aware that if they're not doing at least ""ok"" in competition they're probably going to quit and pick up some other sport. For better or worse, this shapes how clubs train at all levels.  The other large part regarding frustration with the leg grab ban is that the US is a wrestling nation. It's by far our most common form of grappling, you can find a program in nearly every public school, excellent wrestlers can get a University scholarship and it shows in the number of medals the US has won in the Olympics. Adults and children often come into Judo with athleticism, balance and an assortment of throws and hold down techniques developed in wrestling that transfer over nicely to Judo. Being told that techniques they've spent years developing and know are highly effective is against the rules really chafes people new to Judo."
judo,3di2vf,bozo78,2,Sun Jul 19 15:03:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your interesting answer!   The second point you made is important to understand your frustration as we in Western and South Europe dont have a big tradition in wrestling.   First point you made it's the same in Europe. Some clubs are even reducing the Gokyo for children to the most efficient throws in competition and double the gradings with some more belts like white-yellow, yellow-orange, orange-green, green-blue and so on.  When I started in the 70ies, a third of practice was devoted to self defence, one third to nage waza and one third to ne waza. You could  get promoted very fast, if you had success in shiai by batsugun, but you also could be white or yellow belt for years. I dont have anything against doing  a lot shiai, as I allways like shiai, but I never would focus the training of children on shiai. They have to learn well rounded Judo from the beginning. Success in shiai for the talented will follow.  ."
judo,3di2vf,bozo78,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:13 2015 UTC,"Here we go again, with your ""hey- just because the IFJ says it's illegal doesn't mean you have to follow what they say!""-nonsense.  Mein Herr:  THERE IS A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT ""SHOULD"" OR EVEN ""COULD"" HAPPEN- AND REALITY.  Judo dojos are overwhelmingly (again: OVERWHELMINGLY) IJF-affiliated.  Those dojos- the ones that are IJF-sanctioned, that operate under IJF-auspices and promote and test according to IJF directives will- by and large- FOLLOW IJF PROTOCOL.  This includes not only attending IJF-Shiai but (and here's the main idea) TEACHING TECHNIQUES THAT WILL BRING SUCCESS IN THESE SHIAI, AS OPPOSED TO TECHNIQUES THAT WILL GET THEIR STUDENT(S) BANNED FROM THE TOURNAMENT.  Yes, of course, in a perfect world Judoka would practice whatever the fuck they wanted- all the time- and then simply adjust their game during contest-time.  But guess what?  THAT DOESN'T FUCKING HAPPEN.  I practice Judo at three dojos and- in each and every one of them- grabbing (or, hell, even TOUCHING) the legs with the hands is strictly verboten.  Any and all techniques that are now IJF-banned in tournaments (two-handed grip break, two-on-one grip,  ANY kind of single, double, ankle pick, etc.), if done in Randori, IMMEDIATELY get a ""that's not legal/you can't do that"" response from either one of the Senseis OR the students/players themselves.  NO ONE just ""does"" whatever illegal techniques they want-- it's totally frowned upon.  Judoka are expected to conform to tournament-standard Judo and play by the rules, rules which are- as I've said many times- needlessly, ridiculously and pathetically restrictive.  Wishing it away won't change it.  Telling people that they should ""just go ahead and let your hair down and play Judo the way you want"" ain't gonna change it.  Letting people know that they ""can"" do something isn't going to change it.  The IJF are THE governing body of our sport, and when they say ""outright ban/Hansoku Make"" for using the hands in any way, shape or form against the lower half of the body, then 99% of the people who practice standard Judo will conform to those directives.  It doesn't fucking matter that they ""don't have to""- they WILL.  People follow rules, especially when the rules are as draconian as DISQUALIFICATION.  That is reality- what you're advocating is fantasy.  I cannot believe you keep beating the same Goddamn drum, without looking at life the way it actually IS."
judo,3di2vf,bozo78,3,Thu Jul 16 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"Funny - I can do all Judo, I like to do in any Judo Club/Dojo except training with the national squad, cause they are preparing for international competition.   Maybe in Switzerland we are not so obedient like in other countries ... Only once I did randori with an A level IJF referee, who said ""you cant touch bla bla"" which lead to some nice Kata Guruma left and right. ""Yes I/we can"" ;-)  If an instructor is not allowing direct leggrabs (except for a very good reason like preparing for national and international competition), you should not train in this club cause a Dojo is for practicing the whole Judo and not IJF competition rules.  ."
judo,3di2vf,bozo78,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"So I should not go to like any dojos in the area?   Agree with it or not, most places will practice IJF judo because local competition will use IJF rules, local competitions will use IJF rules because national ones will, national ones will because international ones will. It might not be outright banned, but you'll be looked at as the guy who fouls in randori at best.   Judo has a strict central organization. It has problems like these, but it also makes it harder for McDojos to pop up."
judo,3di2vf,bozo78,2,Fri Jul 17 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"Doesnit really matter. As it seems, most Judoka in the US don't like the ""no leg grab rule"" - so you will be the one who gives a voice to the silent majority. Nothing changes, if you dont change your habit of avoiding and chicken out. If your opponent isn't preparing for nationals or international, there will be opponents in randori, who do leg grabs and others who dont. You can decide, what you want. At the level of regional competitions there isn't really much to lose or to win and it should be some testing of your Judo skills. The guy with better Judo will win - with and without leggrabs. Leggrabs in Judo competition are maybe 5 - 10 % of successfull techniques, so it doesnt make a big difference. There is no reason to loose the fun and joy to train the whole Judo in randori - if you want to. Open your mind, have some courage and do what you want to do.  ."

I do understand, why you are doing, what you are doing (try to step in your shoes) I try to bring in a different point of view: the new IJF competition rules are good (better and open and more attacking upright Judo) but I would not follow them in randori/practice, cause the IHF rules are designed for competition. I would miss kataguruma and te guruma in randori and can understand, that some other guys would miss their morote gari and single leg take down. So just do the leg grabs in randori - its a lot of fun.  Nobody ""has just to accept my view"" but its odd to love grabs and not doing them in practice and randori. I just wonder why. Some sort of obedience to (hated) IJF or some lack of flexibility (ju) to follow different rule sets or just to much focus on competition at a low or middle level (if you never go to wc or olympics). Its your time  and energy, you invest in Judo and its your way (do) to do Judo, but I would do it in a most efficient way and as you have troubles to get new members in US and have some competition with BJJ, I would never give BBJ or MMA guys  such a silly argument: ""In Judo you even can not grab the legs"" and ""puuh some sort of bad martial art"" and ""they are bad at groundwork"" bla bla.

judo,3di2vf,PartyPope,2,Mon Jul 20 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"^ pretty much that, yeah. Like I said elsewhere, leg grabs are going to become as marginalized as NNK.   Incidentally, here's one (small) way to dabble with them. Use Te-guruma as part of your initial class warmup; it's just a funny squat, right? Pick em up, put em down. 10 times each then swap partners.   Likewise, use morote gari as a method for uke to practice spinning out to a forward breakfall. You do morote gari, they spin to a fwd breakfall. Then the next person in the line does it to you while you spin out.   Pass these off as ""warm up exercises"" and no one will complain (too much) while retaining at least nodding acquaintance with these techs."
judo,3di2vf,dave_attenburz,2,Thu Jul 16 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"Hi bozo  There are a lot phantasies of some Judoka (who learned Judo within the last five years), how good they would be, if leg grabs are allowed in competition. As you learned Judo in the 90ies (i suppose) and me learning Judo in the 70ies you know, that for good Judo it makes no difference doing it with or without leggrabs and I think you do remember, that techniques like morote gari and single leg take down or ankle pik are easy to defend, if you have good upright Judo in a natural posture. How many morote gari or single leg take down did we see in competition Judo, when leg grabs were allowed? Not very often ... (Kata guruma and Te Guruma are the real loss).  To end these phantasies its really good, simply to allow direct leggrabs in randori. Good Judoka adapt easily to different rule sets and its no disadvantage for competition. You also can have different rules in the same randori. One competetive Judoka, who dont grab legs and the other Judoka, who want to do free randori.

judo,3di2vf,dave_attenburz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:51 2015 UTC,Proves the point that morote gari was never a particularly high scoring technique. I suspect that the reasons are either (1) MG was generally poorly taught or (2) MG is too easy to stuff with good grips. It may very well be both.  MG is a dynamic throw but has never been that big of a part of competition judo.
judo,3di2vf,Suey13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"In fact its very difficult to ""shoot with both hands to both legs"" if your partner/opponent has good posture and knows how to defend with sprawling, counter throwing, bodymovement, draging down the movement of the attacker. In a martial art its also not the best idea to go with your head down forwards, legs back and arms open - your head and neck is exposed for some blows with fists and knees and feet.  ."

judo,3di2vf,silvaphysh13,5,Sun Jul 19 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"I agree and even if you compete it's not that bad. Now you have to move your partner in order to break the grip or catch him mid-air.   Regarding leg grabs, well it encourages people to do ashi-waza properly all the way, instead of just lifting the foot up in order to grab it. Also you can see more Foot sweep counters instead of the ""he is doing a foot sweep, let me grab it yay"".  Overall Judo has gotten more rewarding for the offensive player. And Uchi-Mata fighters didn't profit as much from the new rules as I expected. The people who complain 24/7 just never made an effort to adjust their game. Or they are very limited technic-wise. Just my 2 cents."
judo,3di2vf,dzendian,3,Thu Jul 16 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"I started Judo in september so after the leg grab ban. I haven't had to adjust my game at all but most of the things that feel natural to me I'm told not to do.  This isn't a problem if they provide reasons why I shouldn't do so. For example when I started I stiff armed a lot and it was explained to me that this allows a more experienced fighter to waki gatame an arm, use the space to turn into a shoulder throw, or lever the arm into sasae tsuri komi goshi.  Sometimes I'm told not to persue a technique because it's dangerous so for example when doing ne waza I was putting a strangle on without supporting the head ie cranking the neck which can be very dangerous.  Both of these are good reasons for not persuing a technique but most of the time I get told not to do things because its against the rules. Good examples of this are crossgripping, pocket grip, pistol grip, belt grabs and of course leg grabs.   The reason these are banned is to change the sport aspect of judo to one that the IJF thinks will draw a crowd. I don't care about competing as much as I care about having fun and what isn't fun is being told by my partner I can't do something everytime I want to experiment with an unorthodox grip. It also means that when I practice with the BJJers who cross train at my club after the session is over (sensai won't allow us to practice leg grabs during the session) I get taken down fairly easily. I didn't even know what a sprawl was until two months after starting and I shouldn't have to learn it from two white belts who's background is 80% groundwork.  It's honestly embarrassing how little the IJF cares about creating effective fighters."

At judo's inception, as I understand it, all kyu grades were white, and all dan grades black, and the notion of multi-colored belts was introduced because it was believed to be more appealing to westerners, who wanted visual signifiers of accomplishment."
judo,3dj6g4,Ryvai,2,Thu Jul 16 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Colored belts were actually introduced at the Kodokan because Kano noticed that youngsters needed more motivation for progress, as white-brown-black was not sufficient.

Single weaves are basically like a thin piece of paper. You might even get away wearing those in Karate, etc.   Double weaves are obviously thicker and heavier.  If you compare the former flagships: Adidas Champion and the Mizuno Superbest for example. The Adidas is a shitload heavier and stiffer around the chest and lapel, also tighter around the shoulders... In other words movement vs grip was the choice.  The IJF-approved Gis are almost all the same. I don‘t own one, so I can't tell what distinguishes them nowadays."

Red label means the Gi is IJF approved for 2015. The Yusho is the only IJF approved Gi by Mizuno afaik, so that would be the one worn by Japanese nationals.

This model is the one with Japanese fabric and assembly and is the ""top of the line"" for the IJF approved 2015 series as far as I understand. It has the golden bird on the judogi but I do not have the belt so can not say for that.  The judogi itself is very comfortable and of comparable weight to the Fighting Films red label I was wearing before which is far less substantial. The fabric is  very nice and even got praise from my partners training today (first day wearing it) the moment they took their grip on it. I can't offer too much comparison as my exposure is limited and I just happened to get an opportunity to get one and went for it.

judo,3dd80u,berest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"The problem with starting standing for BJJ is that you end up doing more judo (because lets be honest- BJJ has farmed out its stand-up to judo and wrestling at this point, you rarely see BJJ schools teach more than a couple of takedowns) than BJJ. To really get in the bjj/newaza mat time you need to start on the ground.  I despise the goofy starting from the knees however- we pick a real position and start from there in my school, thankfully."

Not only has my ground game exploded but I get to work with wrestlers and evolve my stand up game as well.  you might catch some hate from some Judo players in the beginning (There tends to be a weird bias from some Judoka that no other grappling art has anything to contribute).  But for people who have an open mind and who are willing to cross train, the only direction you can go is up.  The people who have never tried it do not understand how you're feeling. I don't regret my decision at all.  Good luck to you."
judo,3dd80u,pope_shiesty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:31:22 2015 UTC,I actually went the other way. Started in judo...dabbled in BJJ...returned to judo.   I like both but right now I like Judo more.
judo,3dd80u,bozo78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:06:32 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, did you ever get frustrated with Judo rules after doing BJJ for a while?  Most people who I see on BJJ or Judo sub reddits seem pretty frustrated with the new Judo rules.  Since you are someone who has actually done both I'm curious on your thoughts."
judo,3dd80u,pope_shiesty,2,Wed Jul 15 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"Not really, tbh. There are certain irritations, to be sure, like no standing guard passes, certain attacks forbidden for sake of propriety (guillotine chokes, omoplatas etc). Let's face it - for most people, these irritations come from getting good at certain techniques and then being told 'no, you can do those anymore' in a new venue.   The techniques that I got ok with in BJJ (hip movement, triangle chokes, armbars etc) I can still mostly do in judo, so it's not too much of a drama for me. In terms of takedowns...the only ones that I can recall learning in bjj were the collar drag from standing, some mediocre doubles and singles and the occasional fun circus stunt (like a rolling kneebar when he blocks ogoshi).   Seeing I have some knee issues, I never really got comfortable with penetration steps into doubles and single - which were the predominantly taught takedowns - so I don't feel the loss too keenly.  The biggest thing I learned from BJJ were hip movement, relaxation and escapes. I move like a BJJer with a focus on pins and simple submissions. There are some pros and cons to this for a judoka, though; I think I've mentioned elsewhere that I have a hybrid sort of movement that both camps comment on as 'unusual'  PS: I think we need to make the distinction though that Judo IS NOT BJJ and BJJ IS NOT Judo; they are two separate (albeit related) wonderful things, like racquetball and tennis. Irritation occurs when you try to insist on a tennis match on a racquetball court (and vice versa).   PPS: We should do a thread on what BJJ groundwork can bring to judo, for judo. I think there are some pitfalls in co-opting things without a think through.  PPPS: On a local level: yes, leg grabs/touches are enforced. Gripping rules though only for really egregious things. Newaza is allowed to continue for an unlimited period, so long as the action progresses. Dunno how things are where other folks train."
judo,3dd80u,bozo78,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:15:03 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with you on pretty much everything, I think they are two different sports that complete each other beautifully.  I guess my point was that BJJ tends to have more respect for other grappling arts like Judo or wrestling and willing to learn their techniques.  While it seems like there's more of a bias in Judo that BJJ has nothing new to offer and isn't worth learning, despite the continuous rule changes that keep limiting the sport. ( At least from my own experiences). I say train them both and realize no one art has it all."
judo,3dd80u,pope_shiesty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"You know, I've encountered that myself several times (judoka hating on BJJ). It seems to be mostly practitioners from an older generation (folks in their 50's) and/or those that haven't cross trained. I think we have a lot that we can learn from each other. For me, it's not about where the technique comes from but rather does it suit my personality/game. If that leads to hybridization, that's fine by me. Judo is my thing but I have no problem learning from & acknowledging others . To those of you that can ride two horses at once (judo and BJJ) and not fall off either, I salute you :)    My approach (due to time constraints) is to remain in judo, learn from BJJers and share / exchange play books with likeminded folk.   If there was one thing I could say it's that if you find a good club to train with - whether BJJ or judo - then you've struck gold. Club first, style second."

judo,3dd80u,Suey13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:20 2015 UTC,"BJJ players learn how to break a turtle effectively at a white belt level. I cannot say the same about judokas below shodan. Most green belts that I grapple with think of the turtle as a ""reset button"" and simply hope for the best (aka that I don't how to deal with it). While I understand that this how judo as a sport had evolved, it is quite an oversight in terms of their grappling game.  On the other hand, I cannot escape judoka pins, even the green belts' one, if they're heavier than me. So there's that I guess :)"
judo,3dd80u,stripelesswb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"Likewise, if you put some effort into it, you can become a dangerous turtle: various rollovers to pins, sit outs to the back and chokes, evasions to make space and restart without a break in the action."

Maybe the advantage, that the old ones like me have is, that we learned Judo in the 70ies and 80ies, when all leg grabs were allowed - but didn't work, cause we knew how to defend against double and single leg attack etc. Morote Gari isn't effective in Judo and also most of the others direct leggrabs.

judo,3dbwz0,PoachedEggsOnToast,3,Wed Jul 15 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on positioning in the opponent's underarm during ippon seoi nage? I've heard different things from two different but both respectable coaches. One says to aim for the peak of your shoulder in their armpit, but not all the way up onto your traps, otherwise you risk being taken down backwards. The other disagrees with this and says it's too risky, and that you should aim to make contact with your bicep.   I assume these are both legitimate techniques when applied correctly, and I'm currently trying to get a feel for what intricacies of the throw work for me, so I was interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter."
judo,3dbwz0,luminosity11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:14:26 2015 UTC,"You mean upper arm, do you? I've seen all sorts of versions here, but they got in common, that uke's arm shouldn't rest on tori's collar bone, but further down on the shoulder peak or even on the biceps. I think it depends a bit on the situation and entry, as always. Also your personal anaotmy. Think about what you want to do: You want to control and pull uke in tight contact. When you find the point of best control and most effective pull, you found your best way to execute it."

Just last week we have started to do throws whilst walking back/forward in a straight line. The walking really throws off my entry and positioning. I really want to improve on my timing of tsukuri for the different throws.   Are there any resources detailing step-by-step the tsukuri, or atleast explaining the concept of tsukuri for every type of throw?"
judo,3dbwz0,silvaphysh13,2,Wed Jul 15 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"There are actually various ways to enter each throw. Which one to use depends on the direction of movement (back, forth, left, right, clockwise around you, etc.. ), the distance between you and uke and uke's actions/reactions.  The most basic entry, which is mostly used for static practice of throws like O Goshi and Seoi Nage is the ""Kodokan entry"", also called ""step in entry"" or ""forward entry"".  Tori has some distance to uke (space is necessary) and steps into this space and turns on his leading foot towards uke. Toshikiko Koga uses this entry here:   https://youtu.be/yLElHgZBGR8?t=21s  Notice, how he first creates space by stepping backwards?  In back and forth movement this entry only makes sense, when uke walks backwards or at least tries to. You either accelerate him with a push to create space and make him stop to regain his balance (kuzushi via counter reaction), or you pull him forward while he takes a step back to make his feet run away to his back while his upper body stays in place.  Another basic entry is Hikidashi, the ""pull out entry"" or ""backward entry"". When you stand close to uke you do not step towards him, but turn away from him. This entry is mostly used when uke moves towards you.  A Hikidashi entry here at 0:32 https://youtu.be/8drdcwRAdGc?t=31s  Watch the whole video for more directions: https://youtu.be/8drdcwRAdGc  This video shows the step by step development of these movements and even more:  https://vimeo.com/48143737  To practice these turns you can practice solo or with a partner like this:  https://youtu.be/1-aSESnCxkM?t=8m31s  This is from a short number of videos with Hiroshi Katanishi and Patrick Roux demonstrating most basic exercises aimed at beginners."

It's very helpful to have the videos because I just couldn't visualise the moving entries before.   I realised my problem: trying to do the Kodokan entry (which was all I knew from static practice) whilst walking backwards. The hikidashi entry will make everything so much easier! This was never explained to me in class. Everybody else seemed to just know the tsukuri steps and timing. Maybe I'm over thinking!   I also saw an osoto gari video from that Vimeo link too which was another entry that I didn't understand.   Thanks again for your help. I love Judo!"

judo,3d8icq,Judostu,2,Tue Jul 14 09:40:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor, but knee pains are common in all contact sports, particularly bjj. Things like kata where you have to do organised movements well (such as your black belt nage no kata) cause some pain, but not as much as that. Old age causes it too. So does overconditioning the legs.  It's good that you've been to a doctor. He should be your first and final advice giver."
judo,3d8icq,SuperDuckMan,2,Tue Jul 14 10:06:59 2015 UTC,"I figure skated for 15 years, then came to judo. I have similar issues but they're just related to cartilage degradation, it happens with age.   I find that preparing well for the onslaught helps. Always warm up your knees before judo- pick up a foot and rotate the knee gently to the inside and outside, put your hands on your knees and wiggle them in a circle (yes, honestly, it gets blood flowing and looks silly), put your right foot in and shake it all about. Avoid stair or jumping workouts, those make my next days at judo harder to kneel for.   Of course, I'm just assuming that you have cartilage problems, your doctor will know what's best."

judo,3d6sfr,ShupUt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:48:13 2015 UTC,Can anybody explain to me the physics behind rolling with the throw to lessen the impact on uke? It just doesn't really make sense to me.
judo,3d6sfr,Brian175,2,Tue Jul 14 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the throw. Here, instead of being dropped uke's being slowly lowering to the floor which is sufficient to off-balance the thrower who then falls forward avoiding uke. For hip throws e.g. Tsuri Goshi or hari goshi you can turn the throw into a rolling breakfall instead of a slam, and eliminate the impact completely."
judo,3d6sfr,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Tue Jul 14 10:27:36 2015 UTC,"Sure  http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/momentum/Lesson-1/Momentum-and-Impulse-Connection  Force = (mass * velocity change) / time  Judoka A (100kg) hits the mat at 10ms-1; contact takes 0.05 seconds. Judoka B (also 100kg) hits the mat at 10ms-1, however due to roll through, contact time is 1s. Compare the force generated  Force A = 100 * 10 / 0.05 = 20,000 N force  Force B =100*10/1 = 1000 N  TL;DR - increasing the contact time (via follow through) reduces the impact/impulse, thereby lessening pain for uke."
judo,3d6sfr,bozo78,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:37:43 2015 UTC,But are you increasing contact time? Look at throw #1 with follow through and throw #2 without it. Uke has already made impact by time tori seemingly jumps up in the air to follow through. Or is contact time increased by uke essentially not bouncing off the floor because tori is following him?
judo,3d6sfr,Brian175,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's part of it I think (reducing bounce as you put it). Bear in mind that roll through is more for tori than uke though"
judo,3d6sfr,bozo78,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:05 2015 UTC,I have the same question. It just seems like a bad habbit
judo,3d89qo,Billbobb2,3,Tue Jul 14 07:44:44 2015 UTC,"As Bozo said, it depends what you are training for and your age etc. Doing extra Judo classes is always preferable to missing a class to lift weight or got for a run."
judo,3d89qo,Judostu,2,Tue Jul 14 09:43:47 2015 UTC,"I think there's a difference between (a) recreational judo (b) local competition (c) high level aspirations   For the first two, you can probably get away with vigorous training (randori) and in-house conditioning sessions (like rope climbing, tumbling etc).   BTW that assumes you're currently doing enough randori (let's pull a number out of the air...20 x 3 minute rounds per week of tachi and newaza). If not, then supplemental conditioning is absolutely valuable.   Having said that, check these out for some training protocols  https://www.judoontario.ca/download/downloads/ltad_book.pdf  TL;DR - your call. If you're training a lot, pace yourself. If you're not, work upto doing high intensity intervals."
judo,3d89qo,bozo78,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:34:06 2015 UTC,"Whenever you do something do it right. Running is the exception, but you shouldn't run too much for Judo conditioning anyway. If you feel like you can't do both at close to 100%, then your body probably has to adjust to the new intensity; so take it slow and maybe even skip a non-judo training.  HITT and Uchi/Nage-komi konditioning exercises are preferable. Circuit training can be incorporated into regular Judo training. For example Ura-nage uchi komis, obtaining belt grip into hikkomi-gaeshi, rope-climbing, kesa-gatame escapes, hanging legg raises, ...  Weightlifting and Judo, well just do it if you actually know what you are doing. Don't do a lot of mass training, unless you want to move up to a new weightclass."

I've definitely pushed it too hard, been very drained for Judo, and it hasn't been enjoyable. I'm not a high-level competitor, but have aspirations to be at least recognized nationally, and - through all the toying around I've done with training frequency, strength & conditioning programs, and whatnot - I've learned that you should definitely have enough energy to do a whole class and (preferably) not sit out any randori, as that is your main method of improving, but I personally don't think that you should be walking into class at 100% energy. Working out is taxing on your body, especially if your goal is to improve strength/power - however, you can mitigate a lot of tiredness with proper recovery methods, including foam rolling, adequate warming up and cooling down, consolidating your stressors, proper nutrition, and, most importantly, sleep. There's a lot that can be gained from having an in-season and an off-season training program. More importance should be paid to strength & conditioning off the mat and technique work on the mat during an off-season, and when the ""in-season"" hits, switch to lighter weights and less gym frequency so that all your energy is devoted to ""judo conditioning"" and modalities.   Sorry for the wall of text. I hope this has helped a bit, and let me know if you have any questions."

I now think our best chance is with a new organisation, but if we can retaining IJF membership, running with two horses, to get the best. When i first started judo 1966, we could grab the pants or double sleeve and hold as long as we liked if we tried to throw on occasions. Now judo is a frantic scrabble for grips, and quality throws are tricky due to insufficient grips, for fear of a passivity penalty.

judo,3d5ilv,fleischlaberl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:18:37 2015 UTC,"th problem is not that there is a lot of children, in fact it is a very good thing, the real probleam is that they tend to stop judo when they are 12."
judo,3d5ilv,stuckoverhere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:40:31 2015 UTC,"12 is too early - maybe 15. And I said, you shouldn't be too scared because of the drop out rate. Thats pretty normal, when you get 15, that your interests are changing. At first, they go to Judo cause of the educational system or because of their parents or peer groups, after that some want to have success in competition - but competition is getting harder and harder in cadets and juniors and others want to go to black belt. But what to do with Judo, if you are not a good competitor or if you got ""your"" black belt with 17? Judo is demanding, darwinistic in competition and difficult to learn, if you start after 20 (tachi waza motoric skills etc.) and after 30 cause its a fighting art its dangerous for injuries. Judo is difficult to practice, difficult to watch, difficult to progress and if you go to a competition houndred of miles maybe you lose in seconds and this was your only fight for the day. If you play hobby football or basketball etc, you dont have to train that hard, you dont have this feeling of being beaten ""personally"" and you can do it ""just for fun"". Judo is difficult and hard and no sport for the masses neither as  practioneer nor as spectator.  ."

We have to face the probleme instead of fleeing from it and IJF should find real solution instead of the fake solutions they put on us.

judo,3d5ilv,PartyPope,2,Tue Jul 14 09:34:37 2015 UTC,"The irony here is that Judo -in the form of BJJ is MASSIVELY POPULAR in the USA. Some might cite the UFC for this, but the differences in social-presentation (technique emphasis, dojo culture, fee schedule, etc) between the average BJJ club and the average Judo club are enormous. This difference should be informing the questions researchers should be asking: Judo failed to capture the US market, and BJJ was massively successful. why?  If you want to grow USJudo, adopt BJJ. Like Travis Stevens, he is basically the ideal American Judoka moving forward. At this point we should probably try to make BJJ's rules more Judo friendly. Move in, and take over.   edit: Lots of IJF blaming in this thread. Judo has never been very popular in the USA, IJF is irrelevant, since the number of practitioners have never been there."
judo,3d5ilv,Ranalysis,2,Tue Jul 14 01:06:28 2015 UTC,"BJJ is plenty Judo friendly. I do most of my Judo in BJJ now it seems, what with the IJF banning us from doing any Judo while we practice Judo"
judo,3d5ilv,PartyPope,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:43:56 2015 UTC,"So here's why I do bjj instead of judo. I can train every single day. There are classes everyday but the judo clubs only have training 2x a week. It really discourages me. The other reason is the culture. I'm not really for the ""respect"" that's forced. I like how in bjj everybody is friendly and equal but in judo, there's a hierarchy.   No double or single leg takedown allowed  << fuck IJF"
judo,3d5ilv,Ranalysis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not really for the ""respect"" that's forced.   So you have to bow before and after training and when you change partners. At my club, we often slap hands after randoris as well. Why does it bother you? I'm legitimately curious.   BJJ has the exact same system except that you shake hands, instead of bowing before a roll."
judo,3d5ilv,Vargman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:25 2015 UTC,i don't like bowing.
judo,3d5ilv,Ranalysis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:21:34 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate?
judo,3d5ilv,Vargman,3,Tue Jul 14 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course. I quiver in fear of hierarchy. I deal with it everyday and I'm so uncomfortable around people who are higher up than me it makes me feel small and unconfident about myself.  I've just had a bad time every time I knew there was a ""hierarchy"" placed into the system. It reminds me that I can't just go up to the person and be chill. I have to be formal. It's like the difference between doing a presentation and just shooting the shit with people. I like shooting the shit and the atmosphere that it carries.   So this is why I don't like formalities."
judo,3d5ilv,fleischlaberl,2,Tue Jul 14 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"I think this depends on the mentality of the club. I'm an assistant teacher in our club and we stick with most of the formalities (at least I think so, I never trained in Japan), especially during training for the kids. For me it's a major part of the mental aspect of judo. However all the formalities are not about hierarchy, it's about respect. Student respects teacher, the teacher respects the students and students respect other students. Bowing in judo is about showing respect for the other and not about your position in the hierarchy. We always try to walk the line between respect and discipline on one side and having fun on the other side. At least that's how we see it in our club."
judo,3d5ilv,Ranalysis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:07 2015 UTC,Why not slap hands and fist bump like in bjj? I feel so uncomfortable bowing. I'm already socially awkward enough. Why would I amplify that feeling with bowing?
judo,3d5ilv,fleischlaberl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:42 2015 UTC,"Bowing is basically the same as slapping hands. Actually after randori first we bow, then we slap hands followed by a bro-hug. It's never been awkward or uncomfortable for me, then again I basically grew up with judo.  For me, judo is not just some sport where you try to take down an opponent with some techniques. I enjoy the bigger picture, the mentality, the culture."
judo,3d5ilv,Anthropolygon,0,Tue Jul 14 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"This ""no leg grab rant"" is nonsense. If you have bad throwing technique, your Judo is bad with and without leg grabs. How many throws of 67 Kodokan throws you cant do because of no leg grabs? 10 to 15? The most successfull throws (the big throws) in Judo are all without leg grabs. If you learn proper upright Judo, you dont need any leg grabs in nage waza.  Said this: I also dont like the hierarchy stuff in Judo, sensei here and sensei there and the belt system is ridicolous. There should be only four belts in Judo cause of functionality: white for beginners, brown for advanced, black for teachers (sandan to shichi dan) and red and white (hachi dan and up) honoris causa.  ."

If you don't train it you also don't know how to defend it and you most certainly don't practice defending it.   Judo + bjj was supposed to complete each other but now it seems like wrestling + bjj is the one that completes it."

He had a lot of power and tried to compensate for his lack of technique. There are also other Judoka, who tried to go the ""brute way"" - but that doesnt work in high level Judo.   If you mention Naidan - for sure you can be successfull with morote gari, but thats the same with de ashi barai or kosoto gari - two really sublime throws in unbalancing and timing - and you even can be successfull with sumi otoshi but you wll find only some examples of this throw in competition.   Why was morote gari never an effective throw in Judo Competition?  It was allowed until 2010 but you never saw morote gari very often...  The answer - its easy to defend ...  IF morote gari is such a perfect throw and Rhadi is his prophet, why has Rhadi such a weak international record?  Because morote gari is easy to defend, even if a bull is using it ;-) ."
judo,3d5ilv,fleischlaberl,3,Tue Jul 14 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"Dude seriously what the ____?!?  Are you kidding me???  It's Hansoku-make for touching the legs!!!!  How can this be ok with you?!?  We are a grappling art and a combat sport, predicated around attacking and defending in the most efficient way possible-- which means, on occasion, grabbing and/or going for THE LEGS!  It's not about ""15 throws""- it's about neutering something that's COMPLETELY INSTINCTIVE, TOTALLY NATURAL AND UTTERLY EFFECTIVE FOR THE SAKE OF OUR SPORT'S OLYMPIC STATUS!  To make 50% of the human body totally, completely off-limits is fucking INSANE!  And remember- the IJF didn't do it to make Judo ""better""- they did it to (try and) differentiate it from wrestling, which was in danger of losing its' status as an Olympic sport!  The IJF banned leg grabs to make Judo more television-friendly regarding one tournament that takes place every four years which some people actually watch- and THAT'S IT!  You have somehow bought into this bullshit like some kind of lapdog IJF-apologist.  It's incredible.  Brother- the ban on leg touching- along with the ban on participation in other combat sports- is just beyond-belief-bad.    Wake up, please-- our sport is dying, whilst BJJ and MMA are THRIVING.  These new rules are alienating potential customers- and will continue to do so in perpetuity.  I know of three people that have left Judo for BJJ because BJJ's so much less restrictive- and that's just me!    Just last week I had a female co-worker come with me to watch me do Judo.  After practice the first thing she said was ""you can't touch the legs?  What's THAT all about?""  I was embarrassed- and disgusted- trying to explain it.  ""Wow- that's awful"" she said.  ""Hopefully it'll change."" But it won't.  I'm amazed that a seemingly intelligent person could look upon what the IJF has done to Kano's beautiful, near-perfect art and not feel enraged.  Oh and you know what?  10-15 throws IS a lot of throws."
judo,3d5ilv,twan55,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:57:34 2015 UTC,"No - Judo is a Martial Art, a way (do) of education and selfperfection to contribute to society and a sport. Judo as a sport don't have to be the most efficient martial art, because if you see it this way, you also have to include strikes (atemi waza) to vital points and leglocks and so on to competition with simply no rules. Judo as a sport is no pankration ... It's total ""natural"" to attack the weak and lethal points to neutralise or kill an opponent in a fight but should we include this Judo techniques in a sport? Its absolutely ""natural"" to break arms and legs and very efficient and its Judo as an Martial Art - but what we are speaking of is Judo as a sport in competition ...  ""upper body"" and ""legs"" are not 50 percent to 50 percent in Judo and you are allowed to attack the legs a lot! All Ashi Waza is attacking the legs in some way so if you are not allowed to attack the legs (support of GOD) with your hands so go for ashi waza. With banning the leg grab maybe 5 percent of Judo competition techniques are not allowed and it is no loss. If you need the few techniques with leg grabs you should ask yourself, why your Judo is reduced to such a small reportoire ... Learn better Judo.  By the way - leg grabs where never very efficient. Only some specialists needed this for their Judo and they mostly were focused on their power and so very few were good Judoka (like Van de Walle from Belgium, wrote a book ""pick ups in Judo"" ). By the way - before the rule change I did a lot of Te Guruma (as a counter) and Kata Guruma myself, but it was easy to adapt to the new rules, like almost all good Judoka did very fast. As a result of rule changes we have better Judo now and Judoka are back to upright classic Judo and not bending and passive and stalling is before.   If you ""can't touch the legs"" you have to learn Judo. Excellent shin tai, good tai sabaki, you have to learn natural posture (shizen tai) and you have to learn to attack and defend with your whole body and keep balance wit your center of gravity. If your female co-worker wants to learn good Judo - and not only to attack and defend with her arms - the ""no leg grab rule"" will benefit her.   By the  way - you can attack the legs with your arms in Judo as often as you want - only in Shiai you cant. How many shiai do you have? Do you have to go to shiai? Are you a national or international athlete who is hindered of glory cause of the ""no leg grab rule""? Funny, that the rants against the no leg grab rule are mostly of amateur or mediocre Judoka, who cant adapt or lack good Judo. If you can throw O soto gari left and right in ten variations and Uchi Mata and O uchi gari and Sasae and Tai otoshi and Seoi and so on - why do you lament for some single throws?  ."

You are completely missing the point.  Banning touching below the belt in a grappling art- one that included MANY techniques which involve touching the legs/waist/hips/ankles/etc.- is insane.  Kano would be horrified at the neutered, watered-down version of Judo the IJF touts today.  If you cannot see that then we have nothing more to discuss.    Oh and lastly- please save the ""you can do what you want- just not in Shiai""-nonsense.  Practically all Judoka around the world practice Judo as it's proscribed by the IJF.  I wish this weren't the case but it is.  Clubs do not generally practice techniques that will get their players outright disqualified in tournaments- all of which are run- and sanctioned- by their sport's governing body: the IJF.  Dude I'm sure you are a decent-enough guy and I get what you're saying about using other parts of your body to compensate but your arguments are ridiculous; making the lower half of the body off-limits to touching with the hands is just criminally stupid.  And wrong."

Judo as a sport in the ""IJF version"" isn't watered down. Judo as a sport is to compete in shiai. Shiai for Kano was ""testing together"" what you developed in Randori in Kata. Shiai in sport Judo is for winning medals and glory. Kano and sport Judo are two completely different views on Judo and at the aims of Judo - with and without leggrabs.  ""All Judoka around the world practice Judo as it is proscribed by the IJF.""  Silly to do this. How many Judoka are competing at a high level (national and international)? Very few. So do your Judo throws, which you like to do and don't blame the IJF for your own (mental) restrictions. Grab what you want - randori is lt. ""free gripping"".  Why shouldn't you do ""all the throws""  in randori and in tachi waza/nage waza? Is there a IJF referee in your dojo, who says ""hansoku make"", when you grab a leg in randori?

Your first contact with the Sensei might come as a great shock to you. You must understand the fundamental difference between a commercial school and a Dojo. The truth is that you have come to him for instruction, he has not come to you. The source of the conflict that it is the Sensei's Dojo and as the instructor, he runs his Dojo by his rules.  As a beginner you will probably think that Dojo is just a Japanese word for martial arts school. Nothing could be further from the truth. One factor that a new student of Judo should keep in mind is the Dojo is not a school, and its purpose is many fold. The prime objective of a Judo Dojo is the continuance of Judo. The Sensei is obliged to instruct his students, as he was taught by his former Sensei. The students he teaches are left up to the Sensei. The Sensei does not have to accept new students If he wishes not to do so. If you are accepted as a student of a Dojo and the Sensei feels that you will be a great credit to Judo and his Dojo you should feel very honored to be accepted as one of his students.  and when that is all said and done you disrobe your sensei and suck his cock"

That said a few cues I like to tell new folks are as follows:   Think of yourself as rolling over a big ball, and try to make yourself a big wheel so you rollall the way from your hand, down the arm and shoulder and to the opposite hip. Push off hard with your back foot, and try to get both feet leaving the ground. Many new judoka unconsciously leave a foot on the mat to try and control their roll and fall sideways or barrel roll instead of going forward. Extend your body, stretch your legs out together to land in perfect shoulder width finishing position. When it comes time to throw yourself into the ukemi, think about reaching back to touch your rear ankle. This helps make the ""wheel""shape. Remember that right now you should primarily be focused on rolling smooth, protecting your head, and landing in the proper position with a good slap, not going fast or standing up. That will come naturally when everything else is correct."

judo,3d108r,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:51:05 2015 UTC,"Start practicing the common gymnastics forward roll, to get used to the feeling to roll actually forward (hips over head) and not over your side. Once you got that down, proceed to roll forward with one foot advanced instead of keeping both feet parallel.  On the side with the leading foot extend your arm straight forward, then turn it elbow up and slightly belt the arm to create a ""saber blade"" with the edge pointing to the ceiling. Put tension into the arm and roll over it starting with the knife edge of your hand touching the ground. The off hand is placed on the ground as well in such a manner that the fingers point towards the offside foot.  Don't forget to tuck in your head, at no point during the roll may it touch the ground.  Keep the body tension throughout the roll and synchronize the movement with one long exhalation.  To roll directly forward keep in mind that your hips must go over your head. Feet and hips should be aligned into the direction you want to roll. Imagine the leading hand (the saber blade arm) being pulled slightly into that direction."

Taking from the qualification requirements for the 2016 Rio Olympics in Judo (I assume it will be the same for 2020).    Men: For each of the seven (7) weight categories, the first 22 athletes ranked on the IJF World Ranking List of 30 May 2016 will be directly qualified, with a maximum of one (1)     athlete per NOC per weight category. Women: For each of the seven (7) weight categories, the first 14 athletes ranked on the IJF World Ranking List of 30 May 2016 will be directly qualified, with a maximum of one (1) athlete per NOC per weight category.     And if you're not in the top 22 of your weight division then you have to have a continental ranking as an additional 100 athletes get picked.  But getting a world ranking is hard, very hard. At least from where I'm from you have to get into state team, then be good enough to place at your nationals. Then if you're good enough there to compete and do well in continental competitions. You'd then probably like to compete on the IJF circuit and try and get points to get into the top 22 in your weight category.  I never like to be negative with people and their goals in judo (and I sincerely apologise in advanced) but you have to be realistic, you're already 26 years old and you just started. People have trained all their lives and they're still not good enough to get a world ranking let alone be in the olympic team. I believe I read somewhere that olympic judo training (at least in the prominent countries such as Japan, France, South Korea etc) is one of the most physically demanding and intense training out there.  So no matter how athletic you are, how much bjj experience you have (hate to be a killjoy but being good in bjj in olympic judo is close to nothing, ground work is almost non existent in judo) or how hard you think you're going to work, there are going to be many more people who have worked harder and are more athletic and younger than you are.  With 5 years of hard work and dedication I think anyone can be great at judo, just not olympic ready (at age 26, sorry :[ ) unless you're that 0.0001% of the population is athletically gifted in judo. But if you are serious about trying to make the olympic team I wish you nothing but luck. It's going to be hard work and even if you don't make it into the team you'll still be a kick ass judoka!!"

With 5 years of perfect training in judo, would you reach an equivalent level of skill in BJJ? Judo takes much longer to learn.

I have known many with similar issues and fears, and rest assured it is a natural part in progression in judo and a real part of the human growth that we face in coming to grips with facing ingrained and real fears, that makes judo a huge challenge. Many people can't progress and fall by the way. You are doing the right thing in seeking a pathway through.  In my opinion there are 3 levels of judo from beginner to Black belt. The first level is break fall competence. (severe injury and lack of confidence and fears coming to you in randori, mean you need work in this category) After you regain confidence by repeating the falling routines, and regain your falling mojo, then you can work on improving (2) your hip defence. After a month of improving hip defence work on (3) attacks, improving body position etc. First things first. It develops good judo to follow this 1,2,3."
judo,3czqmh,chchma,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:34:03 2015 UTC,"Hi man, I feel sorry for you, but you don't have to worry. I (re)started doing judo more or less like you, a year ago, so I think I can understand your feelings and troubles.  Those feelings were the same that stopped me from doing judo when I was a kid: after three years, I felt a lack of motivation and a lot of inhibition.   Now I'm 23, and I wish I would have continued to practice judo when I was 13. A lack of motivation can be extremely powerful, but I think you're doing the right thing in ""putting in the paperwork"" for your orange belt, as you say. You have to change your mindset, though. Just a short list of advices.  1) Breathe judo. Do you read books or articles, or stories, about judo? Are you interested in its history, its roots, its development? If you don't, maybe you should check something out. It really helped me to know how the martial art I love was developed, what happened, and what were the major changes. Maybe you could do the same: it also helps on the mat. I had huge problems in doing a proper Tai Otoshi, and this was so frustrating, but after reading a couple of variations developed by a sensei back in the days I couldn't wait to go back on the mat.  2) I have no idea of how your dojo is, but what really helps is to develop a sense of ""community"", of people learning together. Not only in your gym, but also here on the internet, as you are doing right now. I'm sure this will help you. 3) Falls & injuries & techniques: keep practicing, and change your mindset. You just need more time! You started doing judo a year ago, it's nothing! Try to think about it and actually enjoy the fact that you have no pressure on you: you're a yellow belt, you HAVE to do mistakes in order to improve! (Plus: harai goshi is sooo hard at the beginning, when I was a kid it took me more than 2 years to exhibit it properly!) About injuries: they can happen, but just don't think about it. There's not much you can do, except being always focused on what you're doing on the mat, and avoid randori if you are tired. Keep doing falls, especially when you start feeling confident - that's when you have to keep practicing, because your mind can trick you.  Watch some competitions to get motivated, and try to think about the fact that a year ago you had no idea of what the concepts of balance, throws and grappling were. You improved a lot, don't forget it."

judo,3cw6pm,chchma,2,Mon Jul 13 07:38:19 2015 UTC,"Hi; Perhaps re the tattoo if they won't accept a visible tattoo its because usually mafia have tattoos in Japan, yakuza are not welcome in the Kodokan. I would hack a white rash guard to cover the tattoo arm and shoulder...) If you drink late (not recommended, but a few do it) there is a sneak in method, you need to talk to the seasoned residents there. If you train there and train hard you might get welcomed to a local University too, or perhaps if you can handle the training well, then visit the local Police station, it's often hard training there. You can usually stay a week no worries. There are economic clean business hotels /hostel that are like our YMCA. One is called Sakura Hotel in Jimbocho which is a pleasant walk away.               http://www.sakura-hotel.co.jp/ Just follow the rules and do a little research on dojo etiquette.

judo,3cw6pm,shimewaza_specialist,3,Sat Jul 11 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"^ LOL at Yakuza garbage. Love it :)   it's interesting how attitudes towards tattoos are changing in japan, but the kodokan and traditional onsen are probably not going to let any tattooed people in anytime soon.  i was thinking and depending how the tattoo is done, if it is covered enough by his judogi, he might be able to tape his wrist halfway up to the elbow and not have anyone notice as long as he is quick when changing into his judogi.   I want to hear more about the mostly welcoming to visitors. I've never trained at the kodokan; when we travel to Japan, my club has connections so we can train at several high schools and unis.   the high school and uni training is where it is at for the serious competitive judoka for sure (my coach is leaving to spend two weeks at kokushikan tonight in fact.) but for old guys like me who aren't very good, it's much more fun at the kodokan.  here's what i mean by ""mostly welcoming"", my experiences have almost been 100% positive (only played with one guy who was a jerk) and i credit that to the following things that i did:  1) did my homework, read the rules and actually followed them closely. for instance, the international department would rather know that you are coming in advance, so contact them and don't just show up.  2) wore a white belt (although it's permissible for kyu grade holders to wear their colored belt, it is not traditional for adults in japan to wear them. for adults it's a white belt until you get to shodan.) the fact that i followed the tradition probably saved me from some ""learn some humility"" randori rounds.  3) i am a lightweight player (155lbs) so lots of people wanted to play with me, a sandan from my dojo had a great deal of trouble finding anyone willing to play with him, because he is over 300lbs.  the rest is really out of your control. your experience will vary a lot based on what is going on the night you visit, some nights top university teams show up for a workout and there are stone cold killers on the tatami, last time i went was actually hilarious... a university women's team was there so none of the young male black belts showed up (didn't want to be thrown by them.) the place was full of white belts and really old guys, and the women had half the mat to themselves. i played against a few other ""white belts"" and did newaza with some of the old timers.  the most amazing part of going to the kodokan (for me) is getting to actually do randori against guys who are 6th, 7th, 8th dan. that kind of judo is something special and it's really great to experience it."

judo,3ctd3q,ReddJudicata,2,Fri Jul 10 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"Number of reasons:  1) No gi applications  2) Tani-otoshi is a nice, easy, simple intro to these sorts of sacrifice throws. There is no nice, simple intro into tomoe nage :) Yoko tomoe nage might as well be from a different planet.  3) Skill uptake with tomoe nage is very slow. If you're going to pull guard, pull guard :)  4) Uki waza is similar enough to a collar drag that it just makes sense.  I do teach sumi-gaeshi / hikkomi gaeshi (some of my favourite throws) from time to time though. Basically a butterfly sweep from standing, with solid no-gi (2-on-1) entries and follow ups. Matt D'aquino has a nice system for it; check it out  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKSCEeA1UnM  Tomoe Nage is easy to spam...but honestly for BJJ, if the guys want to pull guard, they should pull guard."

In competition the jacket often gets loose, at this point you can grab the tip of the skirt of the gi (suso) and continue with kouchi-makikomi as normal, as long as you are not letting go of his gi.

It's common for people to filter what they are are learning through the lense of "" will this help my BJJ"" (and vice versa for judoka trying BJJ) but if you learn both fully and then combine them you'll be a grappling beast and be able to enjoy two styles of competition and practice."
judo,3cu2mg,GC-Camus,8,Fri Jul 10 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"I love to compare Ko Uchi Gari to boxing's jab. It is a very effective technique to disturb your opponents stance, even if you don't outright throw him.  As with any Judo throw, there are various ways to apply it, depending on the given situation. Here some ideas:   Tori walks backwards, uke follows. None of them is really stiff or anything. Then tori abruptly stops the movement of uke's upper body. To understand what happens to uke, imagine walking through the woods in the night and you run into a branch with your chest: you become unbalanced to your back, because your lower body still proceeds forward while your upper body can't. The late Marcel Clause, Kodokan 8th dan demonstrates this concept here beginning at 3:33 https://youtu.be/pEYLQKEEwN8?t=3m33s  As you can see, he takes a certain stance with his feet close together, somewhat sideways to uke, lowers his hips at the same time and leans into him to achieve that stopping effect mentioned above.  You can achieve the same kuzushi by pulling uke aburptly towards yourself, making him plant a foot forward and lean back in defense, then abruptly changing to a push to exploit his defense for Ko Uchi Gari.  What method you use, depends on how your uke reacts to your actions. Either way, you need to know how to properly use your hands. Take a look at what Jane Bridge, 7th dan, 3 times European champion, does here at the beginning of this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ITwapP2hqw  The lapel hand sits high and pushes uke back and down to a point behind the heel to be reaped. The sleeve hand pushes ukes elbow into his hips. This breaks his balance to the back as well as limits his movements and puts some restrictive torque on his body. Instead of breaking uke's balance to the back and reaping the foot, it's also possible to sweep the advancing foot, similar to De Ashi Harai (just from the inside instead of the outside). To do this it is necessary to exaggerate uke's forward movement when he takes a step towards you. Tori should open his stance back and to the side pull uke forward and sweep his foot before it is fully settled. The lapel hand should push uke into the direction orthogonal to the imaginary line connecting uke's feet.  In a similar way the foot can be swept, when uke moves sideways, just exaggerate his step (make him step further to the side) by sweeping it with your foot and push him backwards. My sensei loves to do a Ken Ken version of Ko Uchi Gari, meaning if the initial attempt fails, he keeps his foot at the heel of uke's foot and keeps hopping forward on his other foot while pushing into uke. This needs a lot of balance training, but my sensei does this so well, I suspect he does appropriate solo exercises every day...   For further material look into the video link lists I compiled a  a few months back for this subreddit. The Ko Uchi Gari samples (good and bad ones) can be found in the comment section of this thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/2qxal0/go_kyu_no_waza_second_set_video_list_the_good_the/"
judo,3cu2mg,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sat Jul 11 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry much about pushing with the shoulder or chest, instead think about the motion you make while pushing ski poles down, while holding on their gi.

judo,3cu2mg,silvaphysh13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:31:58 2015 UTC,Push the forearm of your lapel hand into uke's chest. It's a lot more important to create forward momentum though (ideally with hip contact).

Ko soto gari is another one that's same yet different."
judo,3cto33,bozo78,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:08:49 2015 UTC,"The first video is a much more judo approach to this throw. I'm an advocate of the head to the side, primarily as a safety concern for the neck. However, the main difference I'm noticing is that tori's hands are doing both videos. A good morote gari's technique matches it's name: two hand reap. Tori's hands in the first video are doing the correct motion, which is to say cupping the backs of the knees and reaping forward and up while twisting the wrists in. Properly executed, this throw doesn't actually need a lot of upper body push."
judo,3cto33,silvaphysh13,3,Fri Jul 10 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"The issue I have with the head to the side is that it opens you up for getting your neck grabbed in mae hadaka jime / guillotine. In a broader grappling context, that's not ideal."

It can be done without the crank, and just using the upwards slice of the forearm,to choke or strangle without trying to crank the spine/neck. If for self defence purposes the tackle can be modified to keep the neck straighter and higher under their armpit minimises the chance of getting guillotine choked or cranked.        see      https://youtu.be/sRRt1ASk3zU"
judo,3cto33,silvaphysh13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:03:01 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. I do believe, however, that mae hadaka is banned from all judo competition at this point for safety reasons. That being said, from a self-defense perspective, I see what you mean."
judo,3cto33,chchma,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a ban on any hadaka jime? If they tackle you are allowed to take them to ground and strangle or choke them. (be careful to redirect the attack not to concede points in the follow through, but sumi gaeshi works well, after repelling the tackle perhaps by sprawling and sidestep? There is a ban on neck cranks, that's different, and one hand strangles are illegal, also throwing while armlocking or strangling is illegal for tori (the strangler) not so for uke (the receiver)"
judo,3conmu,kitcheo,6,Thu Jul 9 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think kubinage is legal in judo. It used to be illegal but doesn't appear on the list anymore. I don't even know if the kodokan recognise kubinage. A lot of throws, holds, and even kata were taught by famous teachers like Kawaishi Sensei who came to Europe and Koizumi and Tani Sensei who went to England in the early days of judo. They were not on the official Kodokan recognised list but were taught for practical and safety reasons in Europe. Kubinage is one of these, teaching what not to do helps keep judo safe....I think it was on the banned list for the IJF for a while but not the Kodokan list. Perhaps they do not recognise it, as Kano Sensei didn't invent it or name it?  It is only that if you place your legs outside uke shoulder width feet stance (like in taiotoshi) and an arm around the neck, then its difficult to get body turn in the throw and sometimes you end up smashing the receiver onto their head, that can be fatal or spine damaging. Now it seems none cares. I picked up a nonchalant attitude from referees when I queried the validity of the technique in a junior judo tournament a few years ago. Since I am on a panel of Yudansha for our Federation, we banned grabbing around the neck technique in children's judo, but it is allowed in senior judo."
judo,3conmu,chchma,2,Fri Jul 10 03:26:42 2015 UTC,It's definitely illegal at kids' tournaments anytime I've been at one.
judo,3conmu,JoeDwarf,2,Fri Jul 10 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"It is creeping back in here by stealth, with some referees allowing arm around the shoulder but not the neck. It's a similar danger to uchimata head dive or seoinage and hitting the head on the way over, all penalised retrospectively but the fault must be corrected at club level, and quality control there is certainly variable at best."
judo,3conmu,chchma,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"That's a very interesting read. Thanks for the insight. It certainly clears up and confirms a few things for me. Today I've just read somewhere that you can lessen the risk by adjusting your wrap-around arm somehow, and floating your hand near uke's shoulder like a kesa but not grabbing the gi. Perhaps I should experiment with different grips with a compliant uke, since it's unlikely sensei will restrict this throw for in-class randori."
judo,3conmu,PoachedEggsOnToast,3,Fri Jul 10 07:25:48 2015 UTC,Kubi nage is illegal. Koshi guruma isn't. According to my 5 minute trip to Google these throws are almost identical but kubi nage has a deeper grip. The risk with this throw apparently is a risk of it being a neck crank if uke resists
judo,3conmu,PoachedEggsOnToast,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification. Maybe if I sense that they're going for this throw during randori, I'll just let them have it to reduce the risk."
judo,3conmu,-Fabiow,2,Thu Jul 9 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"Good idea, its good you're being aware of dangerous throws for your class but I have never seen anyone hurt from a koshi guruma so I wouldn't worry too much about it"

judo,3conmu,JoeDwarf,3,Thu Jul 9 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"Risks on kubinage are greater for neck damage. I suspect a lot of judoka retire quietly and only come to grips with this spinal or neck compression problem, on retiring as they lose their judo neck and shoulder muscle. I know of 3 people in my small country who needed operations on necks for that reason. Ignorance of the issue compounds the problem. In my dojo I forbid children and discourage seniors from around neck deep grips until 1 dan, (unless they are very tall, and considerate trainers.)  You create better style and basics for judoka if they learn standard judo first, not grabbing deep on/around the neck, and lessen danger."
judo,3conmu,flowgod,2,Fri Jul 10 09:53:55 2015 UTC,"I guess not, but my concern isn't how legal or illegal it is, but how dangerous it is in the hands of an uninformed student, who may force this throw during randori in class. I think I wouldn't be worried if we don't randori with 100% resistance during training."
judo,3conmu,flowgod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"If you actually let your arm wrap around the neck and use the neck as primary leverage, it's kubi-nage and illegal for safety reasons.  In koshi-guruma the arm doesn't wrap, and as the name implies it is primarily a hip throw so not really that much like tai-otoshi.  To me the arm behind the neck allows a better entry compared to ogoshi where the arm around the waist tends to make your upper body twist back."
judo,3conmu,cascadecombo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"The way we learnt was to wrap around the back of the neck, and the stance is wide and resembles tai otoshi. I thought the motion looked exactly like kubi nage comparing with some videos I found.   But I think you're right, the primary leverage might not be from dragging the neck. I sure don't do that to my training partners. Instead I go further and grab their gi on their shoulder. It just feels like kubi nage when others do it to me. I'll consult my sensei too."

judo,3ck3dt,buddyboys,10,Wed Jul 8 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"I started judo about a semester after starting BJJ. I've been training in judo for about two years now. This is what I've learned from my own training and from watching other jiujiteiros learn the art.   In BJJ a fresh white belt can pull off most techniques in non-resistant drilling - actually implementing them in sparring is the tough part. In judo, execution can be difficult even with 100% compliance, depending on the throw and body type matchup. Don't be discouraged; this is normal.   The BJJ learning curve is very different than judo's. For the first six months of BJJ, you get rekt by everyone (including upper white belts), then you start wrecking fresh white belts. In judo, you're much less likely to get crushed by someone with six months' more experience, you will find little to no success in randori until you start finding ways around the common defenses of stiff-arming, straight-back resistance and circular movement. For many, this takes much longer than six months. In my limited experience, you don't actually start tooling new guys until 1-2 years of training.   Learn sutemi-waza (sacrifice techniques) but don't let them become your go-to technique in the dojo. Jiujiteiros (especially us guard players) like sutemi-waza because if they fail, we can transition to an armbar or just lock up guard and start working from a comfortable position. But many players use this as a crutch, and it limits their growth. Successful standing techniques generally grant you better ground positioning, and your sutemi-waza will be largely ineffective at higher levels if you don't have other techniques to set them up. In the weeks leading up to a BJJ comp, sure, work your tomoe nage, but the rest of the time, diversify your offense.   BJJ stand-up usually begins from a wrestling stance. This doesn't work in judo for two reasons: 1) it's a defensive stance; your opponent may have difficulty throwing you, but you will have as much difficulty as them, if not more. You're not doing anything but stalling, and that slows down your learning (and your partner's); 2) a good judoka will uchimata you out of that stance in a split second. Besides, the bent-over stance is made as a guard against leg takedowns, and unless your dojo is super oldschool, you're very unlikely to encounter those. Do yourself a favor and try to keep an upright posture.   Whether or not you can wear your BJJ gis is a product of two factors: how patched your gis are and how formal your instructor is. In the Kodokan, it's white, traditional gis only. In my club, BJJ gis or even kurtkas are acceptable. Ask the head coach.   On a related note, be mindful of your club's customs. Many judo dojos are much more formal than BJJ gyms and may have specific rules like bowing upon entrance to the dojo, no talking during drilling/sparring, a specific way of sitting down (left knee, right knee, then toes down). Once again, this kind of thing varies by dojo, so ask and be observant.   Good luck!  EDIT: one last piece of advice: take breakfalls very seriously! In BJJ we learn them in a very cursory fashion if we learn them at all. But in judo, you take a lot of bumps, and good ukemi are essential to your health AND to your training. A bad bump could break a limb or even kill you, so study ukemi as thoroughly as you can. Their importance cannot be overstated; in my (university) club, new members take four to six weeks of dedicated breakfall training before they join the rest of us in our normal training schedule of uchikomi and randori. They may not learn any throws at all until three or four weeks in."
judo,3ck3dt,bear-knuckle,3,Wed Jul 8 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"Hello buddyboys,  In my experience, the new Judo students that do well in the dojo are the ones who show up with: a good attitude, have a desire to learn, stand up straight, listen intently, ask questions when appropriate, never give up, and try their best, always.  A good attitude goes a long way with making a good impression. It's more about you, than it is about you being a BJJ player. An instructor can tell when a student has a strong desire to learn, and will probably pay that student extra attention as a result.   Bring your gi and a white belt, ask your instructor if it's okay to use. It's not uncommon for the dojo to have 'loaner' gi's for new students.  Most Judo dojos are more formal than a typical BJJ school is, or may seem to be. It has to do with the heritage/ tradition or maybe culture of the art and where it is practiced. So, don't be surprised if you find the atmosphere to be different. Judo is Japanese, and the culture within Judo can be found around the world. (which means that you should remember to bring your gi if/ when you do travel).  Also, have fun :)  Be sure to follow up and let us know how it went, and where you will be training.  Best of luck! -Steve"
judo,3ck3dt,skubasteve54,3,Wed Jul 8 20:05:23 2015 UTC,"A beginner in BJJ usually gets smashed for the first 6 months and when you roll it’s about survival. In Judo the higher grades will be nice to you and let you throw them and submit them (obviously being a blue belt in BJJ you won’t need them to let you submit them as you’ll being subbing everyone up to brown belt pretty easily). So my advice to you when you start standing is to relax, take the throws and the falls and don’t resist too much. This is important. If someone throws you do no try to resist it to much as you can very easily get injured. Instead take the fall and practice your ukemi (break falling). Randori is not a fight to the death, it should be a way to practise throwing and if both people stiff arm there is often very little throwing done."
judo,3ck3dt,Judostu,2,Thu Jul 9 09:05:18 2015 UTC,"I've just done the same. I had heard from some people I train with that the judo clubs they tried were a bit off with them when they heard they did BJJ but my experience has been absolutely great. The stance is a lot more upright, the falls aren't as bad as they look, there's different types of bowing rather than handshakes but just follow what everyone else is doing and it'll be fine.  The one thing that's REALLY strange is that, when they're on the ground they always seem to turn away to get to turtle rather than towards you to reguard. It took me by surprise anyway. They also have some nice ways to attack turtle that I hadn't seen before, I'll be taking them back to BJJ with me for sure! I'd ask if it's OK to wear a BJJ gi before you show up, it's probably fine but I think it's polite to check.   Enjoy being a total beginner again!"
judo,3ck3dt,giantstonegoat,2,Wed Jul 8 15:25:57 2015 UTC,The turtle thing does have its reasons. If the person isn't very good on the ground they might turtle in competition because it takes a little time to turn someone over from turtle and if it takes more than around 5 seconds then the ref will probably stand you up. The problem with pulling guard in judo is if you're on your back its a lot easier to pin you. If a pin lasts 20 seconds then its game over so a lot of people feel safer going turtle until they can be stood up again
judo,3ck3dt,PoachedEggsOnToast,2,Wed Jul 8 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense in the context, by ""strange"" I just meant that it feels very alien coming from BJJ as people were turning exactly the opposite way to what I'm used to!"

If they're meeting in a rec centre they probably are too but you never know.  Knee locks and neck cranks are illegal in judo, so be careful not to apply those.

Try to keep the thickness of a sheet of paper between your heel and the mat. This will keep you mobile and ready to attack and defend.   A lot of jiujitsu players tend to do standing work very flat footed or even leaning back on their heels. This won't work very well in judo."
judo,3ck3dt,Brisbanebodega,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:55:16 2015 UTC,"You might be slightly taken aback/frightened by the size of some of the throws - not being patronising at all! There is a difference between a 'throw' which is what we do in judo, and a 'takedown' which is what you will be more used to in BJJ. Being thrown with a big throw can be quite intimidating, quite a shock to the system, and potentially dangerous if you're stiff/squirming about! So the best piece of advice really is just to chill out, relax and co-operate. And, as other people have said, get good at ukemi!!!  Also, for the love of Kano, if you are unsure/scared of something/need something explained - SPEAK UP! Being a BJJ blue belt you will probably be aware of this already, but if no-one points out your bad habits to you, then you will never fix them and they will become ingrained in your technique in a much more long-term way. I am a brown belt and I have only recently started noticing LOADS of little basic things I've been doing wrong for ages which are difficult to fix because I've been doing them for so long. So make sure you ask for help whenever you feel like you may need it.   Lastly, and it may sound really cheesy, but try to enjoy yourself. Remember that randori is for practice and not for beating the shit out of each other. Leave your ego behind when you step onto the mat and focus on learning, and you will find the transition into judo very easy and very enjoyable."

judo,3cjd3w,BeforeTime,3,Wed Jul 8 10:55:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not nearly as lanky as you at 6'4"" (1.94+-CM) and competing at 90kg (198lbs) but when I first started judo I was several kilo lighter.   During warmups my gi would come off my shoulder making me inadvertently look ""sexy"" which was totally awesome. And I'd end up with huge amounts of slack at the belt which dudes would whip around during randori or uchikomi (I know, dick move on their part, but I don't blame them; it was irresistible). And in newaza I'd get my collar pulled over my head and look like Kenny from Southpark.  Over time I gained some weight through lifting and eating and the gi fit better through use and washing. It will adjust to your body slightly just through normal wear and tear. And you will adjust to it as well.  Just be careful about dropping primo bux on a ""trim"" gi. If you really get into judo you'll end up bulking up so you can move up a weight class or two. While competing at 81kg will be hilarious at first as guys will have no experience whatsoever with that type of height discrepancy, they will have a huge advantage over you due to how concentrated their mass is versus how dispersed yours is. Now I'm not saying you can't make it work to your advantage, but if my experience is any guide, being extremely tall for your weight class is a serious handicap in judo."
judo,3cjd3w,farkoman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:08:44 2015 UTC,"I've been doing Judo for almost 2 years now, so I think I can justify a gi that is a bit more expensive.

judo,3cjd3w,JoeDwarf,5,Wed Jul 8 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"Toraki has the Personal Gold model, which is close to a custom fit.  They don't make it to measure but pretty close, selected from a way wider range of size options than the standard judogi.  It is a heavyweight (definitely not 2015 IJF legal) judogi with a European style fit.  Cost is $CDN200.  I personally use KuSakura.  Like Toraki, they offer a close to custom fit through a really wide range of sizes.  Unlike Toraki you can get an IJF legal judogi or a heavier one if you prefer.  They are Japanese made and the quality/materials are nicer IMO than Toraki, but also more expensive, about 30,000 yen depending on sizing/model. You can get them from Budo Export or the official Kodokan shop.  Note the Budo Export guys are French but they can do English just fine by email, I recommend them."

judo,3cil5d,academicninja,3,Wed Jul 8 07:11:32 2015 UTC,"tbh at white belt or low grades your technique is not going to be at that point yet. Though your right you should try to use it more than anythign else.  Personally i try to 100% technique anybody lighter than me or a lot lower skill level (not many people unfortunatly) then sort of add in strength as they get closer or above my weight and grade.   That being said some times it can be hard to do technique fast and with purpose without the strength side, but i think thats soemthing that takes years to figure out.  Also theres the issue that if you use mroe strength your going to get mroe tired quickly - thats bad because you gas out...but good because youll probably get a lot fiter.... so you know. Swings and roundabouts"
judo,3cil5d,Bluurgh,2,Wed Jul 8 07:58:39 2015 UTC,"Ideally? None. At least not as much as will exhaust you. Try to keep calm and focus on technique. Consider it always a success, when you can trick your opponent without much strength, consider it a success as well when they have to waste their strength to overcome your techniques or defenses.  Unfortunately it's impossible to assess the ground game taught at your club remotely. If you have the option to do so, you could try to cross train in BJJ, at least until you get a basic idea how to fight on the ground."
judo,3cil5d,ldzman218,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:34:32 2015 UTC,Follow up question: should I focus on pins more than submissions or chokes for judo newaza? Is there anything I can read up on to improve my escapes from pins?
judo,3cil5d,Brisbanebodega,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:56:56 2015 UTC,"Work on all kinds of techniques, but focus more on the how to get there and not only how to execute them.  Work on your guard game (keeping the opponent at bay via the legs) to avoid getting pinned. Learn to apply techniques and sweeps against an opponent who you got locked between your legs."
judo,3cil5d,daleech1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:44:03 2015 UTC,"Usually you learn to go for pins first. It will teach you a lot about transitions, body positioning, using your weight and leverage rather than your strength, all of which will transition well to chokes and armbars later."
judo,3cil5d,dzendian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"There's a ton of bjj instructional videos on escaping side-control/mount/kesa. Some basic principles to always apply is to keep your elbows tucked in to prevent the underhooks and stop him from wrapping his arm around your head. Also, always try to keep your hips sideways and not flat on the mat."
judo,3cil5d,JudokaYasha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:24:47 2015 UTC,"Best answer ever: don't get pinned.  It's easier to actively avoid being pinned (shrimp like crazy) than to try to escape it once it's locked on.  If I know someone's going to come up yoko shiho on me, I start escaping before I have hit the mat.  You'll burn some energy doing this, but you could burn more after they get the pin (and still not escape).  Once you escape, hold position for a few seconds to catch your breath, then go at it more."

judo,3cil5d,NauticalAwareness,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:23:54 2015 UTC,2 questions:  1) This one has probably been answered before but what is the difference between hane goshi and a uchi mata that attacks uke's right leg? is it the mechanics of how the throw is done eg: hips/leg?  2) Hiroshi Katanishi. There are several videos of his technical mastery of throws like uchimata but who is he exactly? What is his background/history and has he competed in any international competitions?
judo,3cil5d,Ryvai,2,Wed Jul 8 05:41:28 2015 UTC,Uchi mata reaps inner thigh. Hane goshi pushes / springs uke up.  I believe hane goshi to be more technical and harder to master.
judo,3cil5d,dzendian,2,Wed Jul 8 06:45:24 2015 UTC,"The main difference lies in the fact that hane-goshi is a koshi-waza (hip technique) while uchi-mata is ashi-waza (leg technique), but the situation you describe is the gray-area where uchi-mata has, metaphorically, one leg in the ashi-waza category, while other in koshi-waza category. This situation is explained in Daigo's book, p.190 (book picture one, book picture two). The differences are usually very subtle, but you can generally follow this logic;  In hane-goshi uke is lifted up with a motion like a dog taking a leak, it's these muscles (leg and hip/butt) that lifts uke, and gets loaded onto the hip and leg. Uke gets thrown in a more up-then-down motion.  In the variation of uchi-mata where you attack the far leg (o-uchi-mata) uke is not lifted up then down, but gets thrown forward. The leg pushes against the inside far leg of uke but the motion is done with the leg."

judo,3cil5d,JudokaYasha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"I am still looking for someone, who can convincingly explain to me the difference between Hane Goshi and the technique called Koshi Uchi Mata, that you described. Some say the difference lies in the way Uke flies. They say in Hane Goshi Uke is loaded on to tori like a platform, that tilts from a vertical postion into a horizontal one from which uke rolls off to the side. In Koshi Uchi Mata uke is more rotated forward as in Harai Goshi. Honestly though, I think somewhere, some famous competitor f*cked up classifying a Hane Goshi correctly and the rest of the Judo world jumped on the train. Who knows... Hiroshi Katanishi teaches Judo in at the Judo Kwai Lausanne (Switzerland). He currently holds the 8th dan in Judo. He has a master of sports from Tenri University and coach to the French national team for a while.

judo,3cil5d,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:39:14 2015 UTC,Why are leg techniques so shunned by the judo community? isn't Judo suppose to be grappling art as a whole. It confuses me that my school doesn't want to teach leg based techniques because my Sensei is afraid i'll use it during tournament. I come from a Karate background so this restriction of techniques is a little confusing to me. keep in mind that I've only started Judo about 2 months ago.
judo,3cil5d,fleischlaberl,3,Wed Jul 8 06:51:31 2015 UTC,"Thats exactly why he doesn't want to teach it. Because of the tourney requirements. You use what you practice. I've had to work on not using kata guruma, morote gari, and sukui nage in particular during randori. Its a shame to dilute Judo but thats what the big wigs decided."
judo,3cil5d,JudokaYasha,2,Wed Jul 8 07:13:52 2015 UTC,"As you know they are forbidden in competitions by IJF rules for stupid reasons. The problem is, if you don't train properly to avoid touching your opponent below the belt like he was made of lava down there, you can easily do that by reflex and be disqualified. That means competitors, even if they want to learn complete Judo including techniques like Morote Gari, Kibisu Gaeshi, Kushiki Taoshi and classical Kata Guruma, they must avoid them like hell even in training. Thus, at least for competitors at IJF ruled tournamets, the IJF indirectly dictates what you practice and what not, thus harming our art in general and no, most judoka are not happy with this situation."

Thats nonsense. The same Judokas, who were successfull before 2010 (rule change), were successfull after the rule change like Riner, Iliadis et cetera.   ""by reflex"" is a myth. You can learn the whole judo thing and you are not worse in contest. Only a few Judokas couldn't change to the new rules and mostly they were limited (a lot of strenght and less technique). Judo in competition is technicaly better than 10 years ago. Exception is heavy weight Judo, because Riner annihilates the rest of the gang.  ."

I used to wrestle, and after starting judo, I spent months trying to stop myself from grabbing legs. The last time I went to train at another club, they'd been training old school rules the week before and when I went for hiza guruma, a dan grades grabbed my leg and then apologised.  You can train yourself out of it, but if you switch between rule sets in randori you will inevitably get confused at some point.  I guess you could just practice the techniques and never try them in randori, but I'm not sure I'd consider those learnt."
judo,3cil5d,BruceJi,2,Wed Jul 8 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"I do understand but your habits and reflexes are from wrestling.  In Judo you have some movements and throws with leg grabs and if there are troubles with ""reflexes"" its mostly with variants of throws, were you grab one leg for assisting or completing a throw. Its not difficult not to attack directly with morote gari or kata guruma or not to  counter with te guruma/sukui nage.  ."

Any tips?  Also, is it ok to still participate in WBW because I'm a newly fledged yellow?"
judo,3cil5d,BruceJi,2,Wed Jul 8 07:00:42 2015 UTC,"For Morote seoi nage, try sliding your grip down to just above their belly button and make sure your sleeve hand is really pulling. Others grab the same side (hand on Uke bicep).   Its hard to envision the Ippon issue but I am going to guess you're not pulling enough with sleeve hand. For Ogoshi, same issue, more pull with sleeve hand, get low (and stay low). If against a short person you can go over the shoulder or underhook the same side arm instead of grabbing the belt."
judo,3cil5d,Leipziger,2,Wed Jul 8 07:17:27 2015 UTC,"There are various valid armpositions for Morote Seoi Nage, but all of them got in common, that your lapel hand shouldn't fall behind too far behind your body. Imagine standing in the final throwing position with your back touching uke's chest. Your head points  forward into throwing direction, but you should be able to see the thumb your lapel hand from the corner of your eyes. In other words: your arm shouldn't not fall behind too much, otherwise you'll hurt your arm as in Ude Garami or lock your own shoulder. Also the arm will not be able to do its job, that is pulling at the lapel and pushing with the outside of the lower arm against uke's arm at the same time.  It is possible though, that uke's gi is too tightly cut to drag his lapel that far to the front. In that case take the lapel closer to uke's caught arm or even the sleeve inside of the caught arm.  For all other throws, like O Goshi and Ippon Seoi Nage or even Uchi Mata: don't let your offside arm fall behind. The idea is to take uke with you when you turn.    Also, is it ok to still participate in WBW because I'm a newly fledged yellow?   Yes, and it will still be okay to participate in WBW once you're a seasonsed red-white belt. :)"
judo,3cil5d,JudokaYasha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:06:04 2015 UTC,"for morote, I always say to my students that they should turn their hand&wrist into the lapel before they put the elbow under uke's arm. This makes it more comfortable for your wrist and gives you more strength.  Also, a top tip for all grips is to relax your thumb when gripping. For example if you grab the lapel with your thumb tensend, then you will lock your hand&wrist thus making your wrist less flexible."

If you feel like you can do more, by all means do more, but the most important thing is to build consistency. A little bit everyday is much more important than doing a huge amount on any one day.   After a week or two, start building your mountain. Edge your reps higher and higher, adding five each week. Do this for about 5-6 weeks and then check /r/bodyweight for more tips.   You also might want to keep a little training journal - pen and paper works for me, but if you want to get digital I'm sure there's ways to do that too. Just keeping track of how many pushups and situps you do will give you something to look back on with satisfaction and stimulate your brain to come up with new and different training methods."

For the first couple weeks, you will be mostly learning how to fall safely and overcome the fear of being thrown.   After that, you will gradually begin to participate in randori (sparring). If every person in the dojo tosses you around like a rag doll, the place is legit.  Competition is a good thing, but I'm not a big fan of clubs that are too sport-centered. They usually tend to be very light on ground fighting, which to me is a hugely important part of judo.  Also, if possible, choose a club where they train by the old rules. Most places teach according to the newer (post 2013) ruleset that is more restrictive."
judo,3chhvj,Kosoto_Gake,5,Wed Jul 8 00:47:44 2015 UTC,The problem with training at an old rules judo club is that the athletes tend to be a lot worse because all of the best athletes compete under the IJF.

We play by the old rules, you see quite a few te guruma, kata guruma, a few morote gari and an occasional ashi-waza to leg grab. We do fine in club-level shiai.  But there's a bit of an unspoken agreement not to focus too much on banned techniques. The few serious competitors we do have fight 100% by IJF rules and they do alright."
judo,3chhvj,zeebly,2,Wed Jul 8 11:31:29 2015 UTC,"""All the best athletes"" is like the top 1-2% of athletes though.

judo,3chhvj,derioderio,5,Wed Jul 8 11:36:14 2015 UTC,"McDojo's become the way they do because they can get people to pay a lot of money for what they think is rapid learning and progression.  With judo though, it's tightly regulated by a central organization, so it's nearly impossible to promote someone just because they pay a lot of testing fees.  And ultimately, to progress beyond the first few belts you have to win against similar or higher-ranked people in tournaments.  That's the ultimate equalizer.  If there was a wannabe judo mcdojo instructor that promoted a bunch of students up to brown belt when they weren't really brown belt level, they would have a rude awakening when they went to tournaments to try and get their necessary tournament wins for black belt.  If the instructor and students are all registered and ranked in the applicable judo organizing body for your region, they're going to teach proper judo.  The real question for you will be other factors: commute distance/convenience, the attitude and atmosphere of the dojo, and whether you can afford whatever they charge for instruction."
judo,3chhvj,Geschichtenerzaehler,5,Wed Jul 8 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Good Judo looks elegant and seems effortless. Look for places with crisp technique. Does what the senseis and advanced students do look polished? If yes, you are on the right track.  Do the senseis moan and groan stuff like ""this guy is too heavy"", before or after clumsily throwing their partner in a demonstration? Stay away!  Not doing standup randori (or rarely only) is a red flag.  Not a real red flag, but a Judo dojo is more likely to be a mcdojo, if it is not associated with a national federation and does not take part in inter-club tournaments. Mcdojos dislike their students to test their skills outside the club. Tournaments are not a necessary part of Judo though, so there may be legitimate placaes out there, that do great Judo, but never take part in competitions."
judo,3chhvj,quinda,3,Wed Jul 8 05:12:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with others that Judo McDojos are rare if you can find them at all, but here is what I would consider kind of sub-par if I walked into a dojo:  White belts being taught or encouraged to do complicated throws.  If you see this, walk in the other direction, because the dojo is putting flashy, shiny bullshit in front of good fundamentals and basic safety for higher retention.  You really, really need to learn to break your falls, roll, and get introduced to the basics.  This isn't some Japanese-themed torture, it is preparation so we can work with you on the more advanced stuff without risking injury.  Case in point:  A young dumbass at my old dojo decided that since he wasn't able to throw a seasoned black belt with any skill, he would use his considerable size advantage and do (who knows why) Tomoe Nage.  He kneed the black belt in the mouth and knocked out three of his teeth without meaning to because he decided that flashy, shiny moves were more important than fundamentals.  That was one dumb guy.  Imagine an entire dojo teaching people to be dumb, and that is what you are watching out for."
judo,3chhvj,JudokaYasha,2,Wed Jul 8 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"Judo McDojos are very rare, but they do exist. Find out what the governing body for Judo in your country is called, and look for a dojo that is a member of that. In the UK, for example, the ""competitive"" governing body is the BJA and there's another governing body called the BJC that is a bit more traditional, but still teaches good technique. For the average hobbyist that just wants to learn ""proper judo"" and doesn't want to compete at an international level, a group affiliated with either of those bodies would be fine.  What you've got to worry about is the places that claim to teach Judo but have no affiliation or are associated with a group no-one has heard of.  The other thing you have to think about is the atmosphere of the club you're training at. I've trained at a lot of Judo clubs and while they've all had high quality instruction, I've found a recurring theme is that the more competitive clubs don't really want adult beginners - they won't turn you away, but the tuition is geared towards the juniors and the competitors. If you have an aptitude for the sport, you'll fit right in, but I had to shop around to find somewhere a bit more 'patient'."
judo,3chhvj,pk618,2,Wed Jul 8 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"of the top of my head:   look at their belts. If the higher belts don't have the proper knot. That's a super redflag. black gis? red gis? nascar gis? if you look around and people are not wearing standard basic white gi (occasional blue, usually the younger guys). that's a red flag. Randori doesn't always have to happen on the first day. When I started the beginner sessions we worked up to full on randori, and would go at it with higher belts in the beginning. But if randori isn't a big part of training by the time you have a yellow belt...red flag. For the most part you should look around and see a lot of fit higher belts. All my senseis, even the considerably older ones, do not have couch-potato bellies. There are exceptions, like those who fought in heavyweight categories in their youth...but still keep a close eye.

judo,3chhvj,JudokaYasha,2,Wed Jul 8 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily agree with the gi color point. While I only wear white or blue, we have a club that is part of an MMA/BJJ gym (an increasingly common in parts of the US). So we end up with some interesting gis from the BJJ guys coming for cross training. And our head Sensei teaches at least one class a day (either BJJ or Judo), so it becomes ""whatever is clean"". I think gi color says more about a dojo's climate and formality than anything. If you really want Japanese formality, the place with multicolored gis is maybe not for you. But it says nothing of the quality of judo being done."

Basically, we're setting up the initial techniques from the katame no kata, and saying ""okay, how would one logically get to this counter"". Thus far, almost all of the moves we've tried have been remarkably simplistic, though there are a couple we're stuck on. I don't believe this is any less of a kata than katame, in the sense that there's a bit of room for interpretation on a couple of the waza, but generally there's an optimal way to do each one. Most of the transitions are very quick as well, just a couple small-ish movements."

judo,3cfpal,M3atboy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:48:43 2015 UTC,"I see. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so I tend to worry about this stuff a lot.  As far as avoiding concussions, I'm guessing yoko ukemi has a lot to do with it. I've noticed that depending on the throw, I'd end up either almost completely on my side or almost flat on my back but not quite. So long as I keep my chin tucked, would my head not hit the floor? And how important is slapping the ground?"
judo,3cfpal,M3atboy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:04:18 2015 UTC,"Taking hard throws when your tired is dangerous, doubly so when your such a low belt. Hypochondriac or not do not mess around when it comes to your head. When in doubt see your doctor."

Although I know that all they'll really say is ""yup that's a concussion"" or something and tell me to rest.   If all it takes to get a concussion is rapid acceleration/deceleration of the brain, how do people avoid concussions in judo even with ukemi? I feel like if this keeps happening regardless of the effectiveness of my ukemi, I'm going to have to stop practicing judo for my health."
judo,3cfpal,academicninja,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"If they say that's a concussion then that is very good info to have. That would likely mean no judo/falling until they say so. And you never know, could be something. The exhaustion and head pain may be unrelated, I dunno.   Proper falling technique helps and a good mat...and a good partner thats not going to slam you down every time.   Although I do agree that is a bit unusual to be experiencing these symptoms from a normal practice...which is why seeing a dr is even more important. Also after you back to practice (after hopefully checking with a Doc) ask your sensei to evaluate your ukemi to ensure you're not doing something wrong.   I've been doing this a long time and only seen concussions two times in a tourney (not from practice) 1) someone taking a faceplant from a throw and 2) getting a huge uchi mata on their head. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen to you."

Indeed it was my hypochondriac mind that exacerbated the symptoms. In any case, I was told to wait until at least next week to start judo again.   From now on I won't randori with anyone that's below brown belt, cause they tend to go much harder to the point where it's dangerous. And I will have my ukemi looked at as well as knowing my limits. I think the problem was that I kept doing randori even when I was exhausted.   Thank you, seriously. I was about to not go to the doctor at all and just go to judo again today.

Only about 2% of winning techniques are uchimata-sukashi, but is devastating once deployed. Other techniques, such as seoi-nage and other techniques have far lower percentage. Uchimata-sukashi is particularly effective, once it is engaged. A reason for this might be that when Judoka have the opportunity to apply the technique the entry or setup for uchimata was probably not that good and one has good control over the opponent. This means that, statistically, the odds of being countered when attempting uchimata-sukashi is close to nothing because you have such control."

The 2% is from this page, on statistics. But they don't record success-rates, just which technique that scores. These stats are relatively old, so we might see the stats are vastly changed right now, but I suspect uchimata-sukashi success rates remain the same, but the attempts are higher."

judo,3ccy6j,MightyPine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"not sure what you mean bro, looks to me that if someone commits to the uchi mata, and you evade with that leg he was aiming at, your counter is performed when he is in a rather bad position.   could you explain what you meant, at what moment would you be open for a o-uchi?"
judo,3ccy6j,fleischlaberl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:12:09 2015 UTC,"Well, hypothetically, if you timed it perfect, you'd be correct. However, if you miss read his entry, or if he faked the uchimata because he was setting up a o-uchi, you'd be in big trouble.  To be clear, IF he commits completely to the uchimata AND you time it right, you are safe and clear.  However, if one of those conditions isn't met, you're going to get thrown.   That's why we don't see it. The cost of blowing it is too high. That said, I draw your attention to the brown belt next to your name and the lack of a belt next to mine. Like I said, I'm not a doctor, so this is just my opinion."
judo,3ccy6j,MightyPine,2,Tue Jul 7 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing sukashi is probably best applied if you evade a first attempt of his uchi mata or if he perhaps gives you a heads up by throwing the entry a few times so he would get you a bit frightened about it. If he happens to try and confuse you with other technique attempts, and then goes towards a full on uchi mata, you probably won't have time to even think about applying sukashi, before you're up in the air - except if you have drilled it to the point where it became your second nature.  No problem about not being a doctor, different opinions are what's needed to gain insight into new perspectives."

If you want to teach judo players self defence, show them how to lump people with their technique of choice.- We already know how to make that work on resisting opponents, we just need a bit of practice coping with being hit.   For example, that second video showed someone being noogie-ed in the spine to make them give up their arm! If that doesn't work in randori (and it doesn't, it just pisses people off), it's not going to work outside in the real world."

judo,3c7gpl,Scypio,3,Mon Jul 6 08:42:18 2015 UTC,"I practice Combat Sambo from time to time. We spar with gloves.  If I was in the position to create a Judo based self defense curriculum, I'd focus on two things:   Incorporating classical material, of which plenty exists. Aliveness.   What do I mean by that?  About 1: Assuming the students are starting from zero, they need a technical base in atemi. Self-defense without skills in striking and kicking is nonsense. For people with no striking training at all, the Tandoku Renshu of the Seiryoku Zen'yo Kokumin Taiiku would provide the ideal warm up for the programme as well as basic motoric skills. Most people who have no striking training, can't even make a straight strike. Practicing said kata allows to introduce concepts like breathing, alignment of the wrist/fists, putting snap into strikes and even balance.  I'd derive drills or even flowdrills from kata such as the Kime Shiki (second part of the SZKT), Kime no Kata and Kodokan Goshin Jutsu. Meaning picking single exercises from these kata that I deem useful at a certain point in the curriculum and drill it with advancing freedom of application.  Also body hardening, punching bag and punching pad exercises are needed.  About 2:  More drills would include dynamic movement drills like ""tap my shoulder""  or ""tap my head"". 1:1 situations, but also 1:2.  The next step would be light sparring. Probably with ""specific missions"" for the beginners (""Try to land one-twos"", ""try to get a clinch"", ...)  Finally full sparring for those who dare ... it's kind of a ""you can what you train"" situation...  Also roleplaying situations and stressful simulations. ...

May as well practice the kata, at least they have some historical value.  We all know in judo that the rubber meets the road in randori.  Making your waza work against a fully resistant opponent is a whole different ballgame than nage-komi.  If you want to learn how to fight a striker, you have to pad up and fight a real striker, not some judoka who's hitting you in a predictable, slow manner.  You have to be willing to eat a few shots to learn how to do it.  This fantasy land of avoiding all the incoming blows, intercepting the punch or kick and then the elegant finish is ridiculous.  Weapons are worse.  I think most judoka who have been punched before could take a punch and get inside to grapple.  But if you are going to defend unarmed against a knife, you can count on getting cut.  Trap, lock, disarm - that's an extremely long shot against someone who is even slightly trained with a knife."

For a high (face) stab it'd be usually be a direct shoulder throw, for a chest-height stab we'd sidestep to dodge and move into a tai-otoshi while the attacker's arm is still stretched forward.

I've had the DVD for quite some time now and that (and the alive sparring) is what impressed me the most.  The ISR-M stuff was developed by two police officers who were also judoka / wrestlers (and BJJ black belts under Matt Thornton) as a way to use natural grappling instincts to subdue a striking opponent. Again, it's based on alive sparring principles (the hallmark of Thornton's style).  My issue with the various Judo SD katas is...no one seems to really attack like that in real life."

Learning BJJ, however, has given me more confidence on the ground, which allows me to stay more relaxed, concentrate on my and my opponent's body positioning, and 'think' my way out of bad ground positions. This, I think, is a very important component of both judo and BJJ - the ability to outwit your opponent rather than just muscle your way out of things.   Obviously, in our sport we can't be QUITE as relaxed as BJJ players when we find ourselves on the bottom of a hold - we need to escape in 20 seconds or less - but I have definitely found that I have had more luck escaping hold-downs within the time limit when I have been relaxed, than when I have just been bucking like crazy."
judo,3c7flc,tatami_traveler,2,Wed Jul 8 10:07:44 2015 UTC,"Well, to tell you the truth, the thing I found most useful are guard passing skills. Since you can achieve an Ippon in Judo by staying in side mount basically (talking from a BJJ perspective), that's something I've found surprisingly useful when rolling in newaza.   Also, what I have found to be a grey area regarding that is the fact that the referee in Judo has complete and utter right to put you both back on your feet if you try to pass standing, but I've been getting varying answers when I ask if that applies to the situation when I'm holding my opponents gi pants (i.e. toreada pass)."

When I get thrown in a waza ari or yuko type situation I re guard instead of turtling up. This way my transition to the ne waza is smoother and I have a better chance to end the fight on the ground.  kinda like a pulling guard type notion
judo,3c7flc,ckristiantyler,2,Sun Jul 5 17:11:24 2015 UTC,I tend to do that myself!  I actually find it difficult to turtle (have always considered it passive) but know that BJJ has quite a few escapes / counter attacks from there (eg: Telles).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7j8aduqDeg  I should really rewatch his set and combine it with some of the stand up escapes from turtle that I'm looking at

I also really really want people to turtle in bjj so I try and maneuver them to turtle so I can work my judo turtle attacks in.

judo,3c1avb,JoeDwarf,2,Sat Jul 4 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"You can counter Ura Nage with O Uchi Gari.  I am good in Ura Nage but can be thrown with O uchi Gari, if tori uses my back momentum very fast (before I have closed my arms around his waist) in switching his direction of throwing forward to backwards.

judo,3c1avb,fleischlaberl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"You have to get him moving forward, and by moving forward I mean comiting his weight and catch him in that direction. Ura-nage and Tani-otohsi requires that he stops  and either catch and lift or pull you backwards. You need to effectively break his balance in the direction of the throw, either by getting him as he moves forward or you pull him. Its much harder to pull him forward if he is going backwards.   Lets say you want to throw him seio-nage, you can get him to move forward by attacking him with osoto-gari a couple of times, forcing him to push you forward. Do it 2 times and on your third entry, you can feint going for osoto, he pushes you on your entry and you immediately go for seio nage with his weight coming forward.   There are other ways to get him to commit his weight forwards, making it difficult to immediately counter with Ura-nage or Tani-otoshi."

He avoided landing on his back and in my view needed to be more assertive with a kiai and a bigger jump across action, the counter to uranage had all the components of Ippon.  For me I just like to hook in for kouchigari and enjoy the ride but keep my body at right angles to tori, and lean into the kouchigari. They fall flat on their back like the video."
judo,3c1avb,Ryvai,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"This goes along with getting their weight forward, but if you can pull them, and get just a tad lower, that should help with negating their effective attack. I've found many times that techniques that don't seem to be working for me, just requires that I get an inch or two lower and make sure to keep the kuzushi.  If they're off balanced, they're not going to be able to stop you, and they won't be able to counter either. Not to mention that you might actually pull off the technique you're going for!"
judo,3c1avb,fleischlaberl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:28:57 2015 UTC,"Besides the obvious of not letting yourself be susceptible to ura-nage, you can wrap your leg around theirs, on the inside to stop the uplift (it's hard to lift someone up who is connected to you), similar to the action in kawazu-gake. Once the inital lift is stopped, finish it with o-uchi-gari or ko-uchi-gari, depending on your situation or their reaction. The leg is already there, you just need to unbalance them.

In our club, we have set rules about using counter techniques. Brown and black belts are strictly forbidden countering Blue belts and under. All other ranks can counter each other. This helps both lower and higher ranks develop attacking judo. If a lower rank is doing bad technique, the brown & black belts ranks might correct them- but not throw them, but not actually counter them in practice. The focus is on developing strong attacking judo."

Gyaku ude garami (Kimura) is much more likely to end up as a shoulder lock, but still legal. I hit it once in in-club randori and it worked wonderfully, but my partner pointed out that it was attacking the shoulder.  Hammerlocks, bicep crushes and wristlocks are illegal as submissions, but many people use them as a control  (for instance, in turtle turnovers).   The same goes for leg locks. Ashi kannuki, a leg entanglement from the half guard, is totally illegal yet I know a guy who uses it without applying pressure to control and sweep.  Chokes are fair game, but you have to be careful not to do a neck crank, because that's an inmediate DQ."

judo,3c13f1,SVPPB,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:37:00 2015 UTC,The 'lock-down' is commonly known as 'niju-garami' in Judo. But it's not any official terminology for the term.
judo,3c13f1,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"Kimura/Americana-type of attacks (ude-garami) must demonstrate clearly to the referee that your intention is to attack the elbow and not deliberately attack the shoulder.  Guillotine-type of chokes must not bend the neck. In triangle-chokes one must be a bit careful bending the head down. For adults this is usually fine, but I've seen some competitions with younger Judoka where this was not allowed. ""Stretches/banasplit/electric-chair"" is actually not covered in the IJF-rules, at least not clearly as far as I know. The referee would probably penalize you for it, but I'm not sure if it's covered by the rules. body-triangle is allowed, but not do-jime, which is crossing the legs around the trunk of the opponent while stretching them out. The 'lock-down' (niju-garami) is legal and a very common way to stall in Judo for matte, but any other kind of deliberate bending of the knees will be penalized."

I do believe the Front squat is worth training, since it has great carry over for your olympic lifts and I feel like these have a greater impact on your judo-fitness due to their explosive nature. But if you don't have the flexibility, or their just uncomfortable it might be better to stick to back squats.

Where as the application of the front squat to the front of the body is more ""athletic""."
judo,3bvtiv,simbazz,2,Thu Jul 2 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"The application of a back squat is a lot more than just Kata Guruma. When you're doing a front squat, you won't be moving as much weight as with a back squat ( doesn't matter if it's low bar or high bar). From a pure strength point of view, this makes a back squat ""better"" to build leg strength than a front squat in most cases. Those stronger legs will help you in a lot of scenarios.   Front squat is a more athletic skill and has it's uses, that's true. But I'd still suggest the back squat as the primary movement to build leg strength. The front squat has it's place, but there's a reason not a lot of powerlifting programs ( whose priorities is not to get as big as possible, but to be as strong as possible at an optimal weight) use front squats.  As Kozbor said, you could also find some way to use both in a strength routine. But if you're a beginner, you might be better of picking a solid strength building routine and follow that for a while.  EDIT : besides, the article I linked starts with the sentence ""The Front Squat works less muscles and stresses your knees more than the Back Squat. You can lift more weight, get stronger and build more muscle with Back Squats. If you Front Squat because you have no Power Rack, cleaning the bar will limit how much you Squat and how strong you’ll get."""

judo,3bvn7p,silvaphysh13,2,Thu Jul 2 15:31:54 2015 UTC,whats the important things going on here?  Low hips so your loading him on them rather than the back? and keeping your lapel hand high?  To me is seems very much an ogoshi with just standard kumi kata grips!
judo,3bvn7p,silvaphysh13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:55:27 2015 UTC,"Your hips are much lower than even o goshi, and the kuzushi is created in a different way. Remember, tsurikomi means lifting-pulling, so there's a distinct forwards/slightly upwards motion almost straight to uke's front. This results in a path of travel that's much more vertically aligned than that of o goshi. Furthermore, the high-collar grip is indeed important, as it helps facilitate the forward motion of uke's upper body. I'm personally a big fan of doing this as a combo, where you attempt a higher-up koshi waza, like uki goshi, then as uke settles back to center to try to get out of it, you drop super low, pulling as you drop. Done properly, they should almost be coming off the ground before you're all the way down."
judo,3bvn7p,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"The most important for that throw is learning the actual 'tsurikomi' action and the hips lowered, but not necessarily as low as in the kata-version. In the nage-no-kata you kind of understand what it is used for, e.g. uke defends the harai-goshi by bogyo, projecting his hips forward and straightening himself, you then lower yourself to throw him. As /u/silvaphysh13 suggests, studying the kata-variation might help you 'get it' :)"

Some of the throws we classify in one category (say, te-waza) could comfortably fit in another.

judo,3bslyi,ReddJudicata,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:44:46 2015 UTC,It's because in practice you don't care which throw you're using and flexibly switch between throws. It's about action reaction. I've heard it said that uke picks the throw by his reaction.

Using this video as a counterpoint in the meta discussion about whether bjj or judo has more 'depth' of technique is totally appropriate since judos depth is in the uncountable minor variations in setting up and executing tachi waza.
judo,3bslyi,lefthalfbeard,-2,Thu Jul 2 05:55:04 2015 UTC,You're right it doesn't exist in a vacuum but there is no link between tachi waza and BJJ. Literally no one in the BJJ world would ever argue they had more depth in seoinage.   It's just completely irrelevant in this context.
judo,3bslyi,dave_attenburz,3,Thu Jul 2 06:08:34 2015 UTC,You're not getting it. For a fair comparison of the relative complexities of judo and bjj you have to compare judo standing with bjj groundwork.   It's a pretty pointless discussion imo but since it comes up so frequently we should at least deal with it sensibly.
judo,3bslyi,lefthalfbeard,-2,Thu Jul 2 09:19:50 2015 UTC,I am getting it and all you're doing is trying to compare 2 different sets of data to fit your world view.

judo,3bslyi,lefthalfbeard,-1,Thu Jul 2 11:38:46 2015 UTC,I never said anything about comparison I said your comment was out of context. I practice both BJJ and Judo I am not part of that argument.
judo,3bslyi,PartyPope,0,Thu Jul 2 11:40:39 2015 UTC,"Fighting gullible people who don't know any better reminds me of Don Quixote. That BJJ has more depth than Judo is an america-exclusive opinion. I think it is a pretty stupid idea to compare two martial arts anyway, especially when one is literally an offspring of the other.  So a friend of mine is a vice-world champion BJJ brown belt. In Judo he is state-level at best because the level of competition is a lot higher. I'm not saying that Judo is more effective nonono, but most olympic Judo athletes start at the ages of 5-7 and train all the way through. There is a difference between somebody training BJJ for 6 years with 3x1h a week and somebody training Judo for 20 years, 6 years of which he/she is practicing 10x 2h a week. Btw. my friend I was talking about trains BJJ twice a week and doesn't have a single halfway decent training partner because Europe.  I really like some BJJ techniques and solutions, but there are so many show-off moves who only work against people who are 10x worse than you. If you watch a match between two highly skilled BJJ competitors, you'll see a lot of basics and methodical guard passing, instead of the triple vertical spin into triangle."
judo,3bslyi,bear-knuckle,8,Wed Jul 1 23:14:08 2015 UTC,"so my friend is a Super Bowl champion in football, but he's minor league level in baseball. The level of competition in baseball is much higher.    Does that sound ridiculous? It should, because baseball and football are completely different sports that encourage completely different skill sets. And so are BJJ and judo. How do you expect a jiu-jitsu champion to implement his BJJ in a sport where groundwork is limited to like 5-10 seconds of turtle? Put a world champion judoka in a BJJ championship and see how he does. He'd get his two points for the takedown (if his opponent didn't pull guard first), then he'd be outclassed.   I actually agree that the level of competition is higher in judo, but that's just a terrible justification of why."
judo,3bslyi,PartyPope,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:58:59 2015 UTC,"First of all, my friend actually started out in Ju-Jutsu, moved to Judo, which he still practices and has been doing BJJ for a few years now. However, that wasn't meant derogatory towards him or BJJ. Being at the top of any Sport is huge. However, World Champion to me means best of the world. So, unless you are a BJJ black belt, the title is a paradox in itself. You might rename it to ""best of the new guys who actually travelled to the venue"". It does sound better than  ""Beginner's Cup champion "". The advantage is that amateurs and professionals can visit the same tournaments.  I absolutely agree that it is stupid to compare different martial arts as I wrote right in my first paragraph. I simply compared the level of competition within the lower skill divisions.  I also believe that the level of competition at the black-belt-level is comparable to Judo."

To you what may be a show off move to someone else may be fundamental to their game.  Most BJJ guys would consider a Harai O Goshi to be a flash move, but you and I know better.  It is fundamental to judo.  I am no Eddie Bravo fan but he pretty much proved that point against Royler Gracie at Metamoris.  Never right off any technique.  Being a black belt world champ isn't a silver bullet.  Dean Lister is way past his prime and he stopped Rodolfo Vierra with a Heel Hook.  Lister has probably worked that move for thousands of hours.  While Rodolfo, however dominate, was not prepared for Lister's technique.  Styles make fights in Judo, BJJ and really any martial art."
judo,3bslyi,PartyPope,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"I don't consider something valid because it worked once. Also Rubber guard doesn't fall into the show-off move category for me. The point I wanted to make with bravo was that there are so many wannabes in BJJ, who don't have any major accomplishments but act like they broke the system. There is a difference between beating a world champ once and being world champ once.  Should Rubber guard ever become popular at the top level I'll stand corrected. Although there are DVD sellers out there who are worse than bravo, with ""mindblowing new techniques"".  As I said before, the level of competition isn't as high in BJJ and even at the top level it somewhat fluctuates. Still, winning a medal at the world championships black belt is a testament of veeeery high skill, so if you show me a quarter-, semifinal,... where the guy pulls of a 14 step move chain and ends the match with a tripple vertical spin into Omoplata then I'll consider the move valid, as opposed to show-off. Disclaimer: that won't happen.  Why do you see arm bars, arm drags, rear naked chokes,... all the time? Because they work! Look I have thrown a former national champion with a two legged tomeo-nage variant where I basically step/jump on both of his thighs before falling to the ground. It's a valid move, but 99.9% of the time you are better off with a regular tomeo-nage variant. I feel the same way about many BJJ moves. Did that make it clearer what I meant to say? Because I actually think we aren't far away from each other."
judo,3bslyi,pryoslice,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"But the highly skilled competitors have to know all the showoff moves because, if they don't, they'll get caught with them just as easily as the next blue belt.

You just have to call them out and ask them to not go down as easily, they will be aware that they are doing it. A little co-operation in training with the throws is to be expected, but if you feel like you're doing next to nothing and they are still going down, just ask them politely to put up some resistance."
judo,3brtns,Fruitcakey,4,Wed Jul 1 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"This post does not directly answer your question, but is something I wrote on the role of ""uke"" and I think is worth posting in it's entirety here. Really it comes down to this, does your partner know what he is supposed to be doing?  A Short Guide to Being a Better Uke  When performing uchikomi or nagekomi, uke's job is arguably more difficult than tori's. Uke's role is not to jump for tori in order to make them look good but rather help them learn and practice good technique. Being a good uke for your partner is an essential part of Judo, getting at the very heart of the principle of mutual welfare and benefit. That being said, it is by no means easy. We spend countless hours working on how to be a better tori, rarely thinking about how to be a better uke.  Take the right grip  Some consider it something of a judo faux-paux to take an inside or dominant grip with your tsurite hand when your partner is performing uchikomi or nagekomi. If you do, your arm will just block them from turning in, so unless the exercise specifically calls for it (such as in a kumi-kata drill) just take a neutral outside grip on your partner.  Provide the right kind of resistance  In general an uke should only resist a technique when the technique is being performed extremely poorly or when the drill/exercise warrants it.  As tori moves through the phases of the throw, kuzushi to tsukuri to kake, uke should allow himself to be moved into the correct position for each phase of the chosen technique. So, if tori is performing a right handed osoto gari then uke should allow all of his weight to be shifted onto his right leg, then as the support leg is reaped, resist the natural inclination to transfer his weight onto the left leg. If tori is performing a forward technique, then it is important that uke allows himself to be drawn forward onto his tiptoes, rather than taking a step to remain balanced. This is particularly important when working with novice judoka, whose entries may not be as fast or perfect as higher level judoka, who should be performing the techniques so quickly and efficiently you wouldn't be able to take that forward step even if you wanted to.  The mistake that some make when trying to be a good uke is that rather than allowing themselves to be moved, they actually move themselves for their tori. Your partner will never know if he is generating kuzushi if you are moving forward onto your tiptoes for him. The only time this is really acceptable is when there is a huge size or strength difference between judoka. Such as when an adult is working with a child.  Ultimately, the best way uke can help tori to learn is by accurately reflecting how they are feeling the technique.   Take the Fall  Many novice judoka are understandably nervous when acting as uke during nage komi. As such it is not uncommon for them to cling onto tori in order to slow their fall, stiffen up in anticipation of impacting the mat or go into an involuntary jigotai as tori begins his entry. Some even jump into the throw in the mistaken belief that this enables them to perform better ukemi. Ironically, all of these actions increase the chance of injury for both uke and tori. As a general rule uke should remain relaxed throughout all phases of the throw, keep their chin tucked into their chest and slap the mat just before they land, just as they would when practicing breakfalls. Unfortunately the best way to become more comfortable taking falls is by taking more of them. Though tori should always be mindful of his uke’s wellbeing.  Learn as Uke  When it is their turn to be uke during uchikomi many judoka simply stand passively, allowing themselves to be used as a dummy whilst daydreaming about what they are going to have for breakfast in the morning. Aside from not being helpful for tori, this is wasting a great learning opportunity. By paying close attention to their tori's actions uke can learn the timing and rhythm of a good technique. They can also begin to feel when there is an opportunity for an evasion or counter. They should also be trying to pick up on their tori's 'tells', something which may prove useful during randori later in the session.  Most of All - Communicate!  When they are on the mat, some judoka take things very seriously indeed and communicate using nothing more than a series of grunts. This is fine when you and your partner have been training together for years, but if it is your first time practicing with somebody, it is not really very helpful.   Whilst constant chatting is likely to be frowned upon, knowing what technique your partner is going to perform or what aspect of it that they want to improve can help you to help them by behaving appropriately or even standing in a certain way. Tori will often signal this using his body language, such as by tapping your feet from the inside to indicate he would like you to take a wider stance. Keep an eye out for these sort of signals and in time picking up on and reacting to them will become second nature.  If you are of a higher grade or considerably more experienced than your partner, they would  also probably appreciate your feedback on how to improve. You don’t need to completely stop the exercise and teach them the technique step by step, but a quick pointer along the lines of ‘try not to come so close with your first step’ can sometimes mean a big improvement in a novices technique.    If the shoe is on the other foot and you find yourself playing uke for a more advanced or skilled tori, then communicating with them could perhaps become more important. If you feel that you can’t take being thrown at the intensity they are working, don’t be afraid to tell them. You can’t be a good uke if you’re not on the mat due to injury!"
judo,3brtns,TCamilo19,3,Wed Jul 1 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"Are they just dropping, or are they not moving their feet at all when you apply kuzushi and gaming because of that. It sounds like your partner's problem"
judo,3brtns,judokalinker,2,Wed Jul 1 17:53:38 2015 UTC,i would probably ask for a bit of resistance if they felt too light. This must be a beginner thing. During uchikomis its usually uke's job to keep tori from moving around too much.

judo,3bt00y,Murrgalicious,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:16:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I was just trying to see if anyone had something that became a ""shortcut"" to having to fully pass the guard every time."
judo,3bt00y,Paladin_PDX,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:39:07 2015 UTC,There are lots of techniques that should land you in fairly advantageous positions.
judo,3bt00y,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"Don't stop immediately after the throw and let the other person establish their guard. Yes, you land between the other persons legs but that's very different to them establishing the grips, leg position, and hip control needed for an effective guard position.  Because of this you should be looking for guard passes that start where the throws finish, and let you pin one of their legs to the ground, immediately after hitting the deck. Ko uchi gari ties in very well with knee slice passes where you sweep right leg to right leg, and then continue this by trapping their right thigh against the mat with your right shin."

I literally had to break it down in steps in my head to get it right.  Once I was able to get the pull and step right it built a great foundation for my harai goshi.  Been practicing judo for over 15 years now and its one of those throws that I make sure I practice every class.

judo,3bpezq,fleischlaberl,2,Wed Jul 1 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"This position is weak, cause it has balance only in two directions - forth and back.

judo,3bpezq,Ryvai,2,Wed Jul 1 10:12:40 2015 UTC,"That's a terrible stance against an opponent who knows how to deal with it. His lead leg is very vulnerable and can easily be put off-balance. I like to adopt kenka-yotsu against that (left-vs-right), grab his elbow on his lead hand, pull him in the direction of his elbow and sweep his lead leg with de-ashi-barai. The other is to rotate him back into position. Grab his collar on his leading side with your leading hand (kenka-yotsu), then twist your body outwards (not curling into the leading hand) while pulling him towards you. This forces him to come forward with the leg that is behind, in perfect position for seoi-nage :)"

By using double sleeve and pull down, you stop his power-hand from reaching it. At the moment he pushes upward, you can use that force to immediately throw sode-tsurikomi-goshi.  If uke is weak towards one side you can grab both sleeves, pull down and try to ""cross"" them to create the kuzushi for deep tai-otoshi."

Our Sensei was going over grip fighting last night and he made a statement in passing that I thought I'd ask the forum about. He was showing different grip setups and relative body positions between nage and uke and said ""This one favors hip throwers"". I guess Judo competitors, as they progress, begin to specialize to the extent that some will specialize in koshi-waza and others in ashi-waza. Is this a correct assumption?  Also, would you recommend some good books for a beginner?"

Also you may think you have found your ""niche"" a few times before you actually do. A common phrase used in judo is ""tokuwaza"" which means favourate technique. Most judoka have one and given enough time and study can develop a deep understanding of the technique to the point they can use it in a variety of situations against a variety of opponents.  As for books to read, well, books cost money. This blog is free to read and contains lots of great articles on the fundamentals of jud and that are very well written The Difficult Way"

Most judokas will use at least one or two throws from every group, but your body type and preferences will lead you to favor some techniques, and some grip strategies.  For instance, I'm a tall and heavy guy with long legs. I like tai otoshi (te waza), ouchi gari (ashi waza) and uchi mata (technically ashi waza, but arguably blurs the line with koshi waza).  I also favor a high collar grip, especially when fighting lighter guys, because it allows me to put some weight on my opponent, and nullifies a bit of their speed advantage."

judo,3bpezq,TCamilo19,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:11:31 2015 UTC,"Kuzushi is usually translated with ""balance breaking"", this is not 100% accurate, but it gets the idea across. To throw somebody with little or at least not more than a reasonable amount of strength, uke must stand or move in a way that makes tori's throwing attempt easier or at least difficult to resist. There are many ways to achieve this, but unfortunately there is no ""silver bullet"", not trick that will always work.   The most basic tool to teach Kuzushi is the classical method known as happo no kuzushi, ""eight directions balance breaking"". A standing uke is pushed/pulled back or forth or lateral or into a diagonal direction. If he doesn't move, he's lose his balance.  Unfortunately this teaching method has some obvious flaws, no one lets himself be unbalanced like that. Also uke has no rigid body, it can bent, twist and turn.  We must learn deal with moving partner... I wrote more about it here:  https://en.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/3balat/is_there_something_wrong_im_doing_in_kuzushi/cskeupk"

In my opinion, MMA can very much be on the path if the fighter chooses to pursue it as a way to become a better person.  If we are talking about the path of warrior spirit."

People decrying the possibility of non competitive gradings, total dismissal of kata as having any value, every randori to the death with no opportunity to try a new technique...

judo,3bnwet,silvaphysh13,3,Tue Jun 30 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"It's pretty well defined actually. There aren't a dozen of official variants in Kodokan Judo, just one or two.  This is how it is taught by the Kodokan and described by Toshiro Daigo (there are variations of the basic setup of course, like lapel grip with thumb inside or outside, but that's it):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHePzoviPaE  Descriptions of Shiro Saigo's famous Yama Arashi fit the throw shown in the video above.  Kyuzo Mifune executes it somewhat different, his leg action is far more subtle:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOKXdMSgiZU   The problem is, that there are other japanese or pseudo-japanese martial arts, that have completely different techniques with the same name. There are also some dilettantes who think they know Judo's Yama Arashi  but teach some bullshido instead. Thus the confusion.  EDIT: Enhanced my reply a bit."
judo,3bnwet,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the first link is close to how I learned it, though the version I was taught had tori using the blade of the hand against the crease of the shoulder to create a leverage point. Then, the outside leg would basically move in a motion similar to ashi guruma, as your arms pulled/pushed in a large, sweeping circle. A lot of the demonstrations I see, however, basically show it as either a modified harai goshi or tai otoshi."
judo,3bnwet,PoachedEggsOnToast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:58:47 2015 UTC,"This will sound really naive but the first link looks a lot like harai goshi, how do they differ?"

judo,3bnwet,SVPPB,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:11:36 2015 UTC,"You lift and reap upwards, sort of like uchi mata. It's very hard to do it right, but if you can make it work it's a brutal throw for uke."
judo,3bnwet,carasci,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"What made the difference really click for me was looking at the path uke takes.  In harai goshi, uke falls very much like they would for o goshi: they're propped on the hip and rolled over (by sweeping out the legs) but don't really go inverted, and they usually fall sort of sideways in front of tori.  In the yama arashi from the first link, their entire body flips up and over their head, so they land linearly in front of tori more like they would for something like uki otoshi (not that the two are particularly similar throws).  Mifune's version is a somewhat different animal, though, almost like an odd cross between tai otoshi and hane goshi."
judo,3bnwet,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"The question isn't as naive as you may think. It looks like a grip variant of Harai Goshi at the first glance.  I think the difference mostly lies in how it is prepared and how tori uses his leg. Yama Arashi is not a Koshi Waza (as Harai Goshi), but a Te Waza. Thus the throw is mainly done with the hands. The one sided grip is not ""just for fun"", the grip helps tori to maintain uke's akward, upright position.  Also notice the initial wave movement: That's how uke is provoked into rising his body, which is then exaggerated by tori (the same kuzushi can be used for other throws as well though). Uke is ""made tall"" by tori, who then takes position himself and blocks uke's foot at the shin with his sole (which is different from Harai Goshi). While tori's hands guide uke down, tori's leg prevents uke from overstepping, he doesn't sweep upper tigh vs upper tigh though. Mifune just blocks uke's leg, others as in the first video push back and up with their sole to rotate uke forward.  If somebody came up with this throw today, it probably would be declared either a Tai Otoshi variant or a Harai Goshi variant with and odd grip and more/less hip contact than usual. Since the throw plays an imporant role in the history of Judo though, it is very unlikely it will be reduced to variant status.  Unfortunately I don't have my Daigo books not at hand right now, otherwise I'd look there for deeper information about what ""makes"" these throws."

I was looking for Sambo over Judo to Crosstrain for BJJ. Sambo is the middle ground of grappling they not only have great stand up (Judo Throws & Wrestling Takedowns) but also have some of the best leg attacks out there (Calf slicers,kneebars,heel hooks,etc) if I could do Sambo I would. It's awesome. Also Combat Sambo is pretty much MMA with a Gi (side note)"
judo,3blt2j,Anthony126517,4,Tue Jun 30 08:48:43 2015 UTC,"So, predominantly - availability? I have the impression that of the few Sambo clubs in Australia, most struggle with sustainability. It doesn't seem to be a well known 'brand'.   What are everyone's thoughts on a sambo crash course for Judoka, per the example cited?"
judo,3blt2j,ckristiantyler,-1,Tue Jun 30 09:33:51 2015 UTC,"Since when can you do heel hooks in Sambo? You're learning the same stuff, the throws and ashi waza probably better in judo."
judo,3blt2j,bear-knuckle,0,Tue Jun 30 16:27:25 2015 UTC,"You won't learn a sweep single or a double leg in judo, but you will in Sambo. More importantly, you'll learn how to transition between and defend both leg takedowns and judo-style throws. In an open format like BJJ competition, that's much more important than having the best technique. You can have the best seoinage in the country, but if you can't stop a double leg, you're fucked in a BJJ competition.   I don't think that anyone would argue that judo's throws aren't the best in the world. But in an open format like BJJ, it's better to have an 80-point throw game and an 80-point leg takedown game than to have a 100-point throw game and no leg takedown game at all. Not to mention all the setup options that leg attacks provide."
judo,3blt2j,ckristiantyler,2,Tue Jun 30 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"I've learned morote gari, kibisu gaeshi, and kata guruma from Judo. And I've been taught, well in fact, how to transition from these. You're assuming that judo abides by the competition ban of these techniques, when that's simply not the case in quite a few dojos. Also hey there's a market for it to be taught for bjj cross trainers like myself and people who live near free style judo tournaments."
judo,3blt2j,bear-knuckle,2,Tue Jun 30 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not assuming anything - I actually learned those techniques in judo as well. But you and I are lucky to have learned them at all, because many (I would argue most) clubs don't teach them whereas ALL Sambo gyms do. And even then, the level of instruction for leg takedowns in judo is not as good as it is in wrestling and Sambo. Judo contains many techniques included in wrestling, but not all, and they often differ on how they attack the technique."
judo,3blt2j,ckristiantyler,2,Wed Jul 1 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're right in saying that the main techniques being taught in dojos aren't of the old rules at most places. But I'm telling you and everyone else that our teachers who grew up in these rules want and will teach you most if not all the old ""banned"" techniques if you ask. I'd say that the leg grab techniques are as good as wrestling, because we're in the gi. These people who went through their judo career with leg grabs had to develop defense and combinations for these techniques. Ko uchi into an ankel pick, would be different without the gi. They're different because they have to be."
judo,3blt2j,bear-knuckle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:10:42 2015 UTC,"I think most older teachers would be willing to teach them, but that doesn't mean that they will. If half the class doesn't want to learn them, the instructor probably won't dedicate class time to it. He may go over it before or after class if you ask, but instructors have limited time. If the only instruction and guided practice you can receive on the subject, you're not going to get a ton of work in - at least, not as much as you would if it were a concrete part of the unified curriculum as exists in Sambo and particularly oldschool judo gyms."
judo,3blt2j,ckristiantyler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:00:07 2015 UTC,The newer guys def wanna teach it. And honestly no one likes the leg grab ban so who would be opposed to it? Other than guys training for shiai

And it's a particularly important group of people since gyms' reputations are affected by shiai performance. There's a reason why these kinds of rules have a profound influence on what techniques are taught and how (see: leg locks in BJJ).
judo,3blt2j,ckristiantyler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:23:21 2015 UTC,Still not always the main point in teaching at a dojo. Just saying they're still being taught and being taught well
judo,3blt2j,wookiejeebus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:50:15 2015 UTC,"agreed but there is some validity in what he's assuming. I've definitely noticed the changes in what gets taught and seen in randori after each rule change.  Even visited a gym and had the instructor come by after I executed a kata guruma in randori to inform me ""Oh, thats not competition legal anymore"".  Which is silly because we're just sparring and not in a competition.."
judo,3blt2j,pk618,2,Tue Jun 30 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yah it's a distribution issue. There aren't many people experienced in sambo in the US, for instance, so there are very few tournaments etc. My head Sensei was on the US Sambo team back in the day and training in the USSR/Russia but we still stick to judo and jiu jitsu tournaments because they are much more widely available and have better quality control. I'd love to learn official sambo and compete under those rules, but it's not practical to do where I am."
judo,3blt2j,osotogary_,2,Tue Jun 30 09:33:22 2015 UTC,"Despite the sentiment in this sub, I get the impression that the average judoka isn't quite ready to jump ship yet. In addition to the distribution issues with sambo, I feel like most people are pretty satisfied with judo. Straight judoka may grumble about the rules, but it's not enough to leave the dojo you've been going to for years. BJJ guys looking for standup may figure that they can learn to shoot and sprawl sufficiently in BJJ or wrestling class, and just want to learn some big throws. sambo style leg locks are also illegal in a lot of BJJ competitions anyway."

There are other organizations coming up now which will hopefully put pressure on the IBJJF to innovate."
judo,3blt2j,osotogary_,2,Tue Jun 30 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"That's part of the reason that I think it's so important for us to preserve less popular arts like Sambo and Catch. There are some really good things that come with popularity, like quality control and availability, but the big arts like Judo and BJJ inevitably get bogged down with beaurocracy and arbitrary rules and, God forbid, Olympic status. It's nice to have a smaller, less popular art available with less beaurocracy and bullshit."
judo,3blt2j,lefthalfbeard,2,Tue Jun 30 18:23:43 2015 UTC,Surely people who take part in Sambo should be called Sambukas.
judo,3blt2j,twan55,3,Tue Jun 30 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"First off, it has a weird name, at least for those of us in the US. Sambo was, historically, a racist moniker:   http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Sambo.aspx  Secondly, it's Russian- and culturally speaking, Russia lags behind the Japanese in terms of popularity.  Thirdly, it's not as ""pretty"" as Judo: the moves are more ""direct"" and utilitarian and it's missing the kind of graceful, ballet aspect Judo has- and then there are the ugly shorts, red kurtkas, etc.    Fourthly, it's rougher: Sambo is more hardcore than Judo, period.  Fifthly, it originated at the behest of Stalin- history's greatest-ever mass murderer, a man who even killed its founder- plus, it came from a communist country whose culture is alien to ours.  Sambo was Soviet, which = bad, Judo was Japanese, which = good (yes I know who fought alongside and against whom in WWII but that's irrelevant; in the minds of many, the above is/was true).  Fifthly, it's too diffuse: what are we talking- punching Sambo or non-punching Sambo?  Judo is Judo: no punches, all throws, pure grappling.  Sambo is this wicked, gangly Russian beast capable of getting the job done in MANY different ways.  As such, it's confusing.  Sixthly: we bow to Kano, an upper class educator who looks serenely down upon us from the heavens.  Who made Sambo?  Exactly.  Look- PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT KNOCKING SAMBO, NOR DO I, PERSONALLY, NECESSARILY ""FEEL"" OR ""AGREE"" WITH WHAT I'VE JUST WRITTEN.  I'm simply offering my opinions/observations/guesses as to why it's not more popular.  Because if I'm honest, it's actually the closest thing to fighting perfection that exists on earth."

That speaks about the quality of the club more than the style as a whole, and the 14-yr (or whatever) is power trippin', it can happen everywhere else.  In some ways, Judo can be more rigid than MMA: It's a traditional Japanese style that started a lot of the stereotypes about martial arts (gi and belt system started there), and the Japanese are just big on respect.    Second, some people join Asian martial arts for the ""Asian mystique"", not for the sport - so they may have emphasized that to pander to the market.

I don’t know what country you live in but in the United States everyone believes the answer to Judo’s problems are in getting more children to the club.  I don’t believe that.  I believe the solution to Judo’s attrition issue is to get more people in the club and to lighten up with the seriousness of it all.  I believe Judo can be for almost everyone but quite frankly, and I have seen this for myself, if you’re not young you are not valuable to the club and I blame that on the culture of competition and medal chasing.  Shiai is important but in many clubs if you’re not actively competing you’re not treated the same."
judo,3bifmo,Rockpyle,3,Mon Jun 29 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"Judo had some ""magic"", when it got public recognition and popular in the 50ies and 60ies in Europe and in the USA. A magazine like ""black belt"" was lit. a ""judo magazine"". Late 60ies came Karate (Bruce Lee) and was top in the 70ies. 80ies were for some Ninja stuff and late 80ies was Aikido with Steven Segal. 90ies was UFC and from there BJJ.   Judo isn't ""magic"" in a way of supernatural powers and its no sport for spectators. You have to understand Judo to watch Judo. You don't have to have a clue about boxing to watch boxings final result - the big K.O. Judo has lost the ""magic"" of the 50ies and 60ies - so no superhuman powers with Judo. Judo is for the kids to learn some self defence, some confidence, some coordination and get some friends. Judo is very darwinistic in competition and hard at national level. So where is the benefit? Getting a ""black belt""? And after this? You cant do Judo alone  - you need good partners. Another disadvantage.   Said this, our Club has 500 members, about 50 active black belts and the national squad training two times a week - yes, I am a lucky one living 300m from the dojo.  ."

judo,3bifmo,cheejiayuan512,2,Tue Jun 30 10:09:50 2015 UTC,"According to this website, more than 20 million people do Judo world wide. I have no way of verifying the number but since it is from the IJF the numbers should have some basis.   In Germany the numbers went down by 100.000 within 13 years (270.000 -> 170.000). Sports in general are down here though because there are fewer children, who do less sports.   People at my club aren't very serious; however, we do bow at the beginning and the end of each session as well as before and after each randori.   Go to an adult class, show some respect (don't walk on the mat with shoes for example) and everything should be fine. Maybe they had too many one-time show ups. You know the ""can you show me an armbar like Rousey"" crowd. If they remain shitlords, well there are morons everywhere... The average level of Judo isn't really high in the US anyway. Either find a better club or do BJJ.  If the numbers are down, then my guess is that Judo is too rough for (western?) society and the values of humility and respect are secondary in today's culture. Also a lot of people lack the patience."

All the while a Sandan was walking around watching it.  It was absolutely awful. The parents complained and he (orange guy) is no longer teaching kids.  The main problem with judo today is IMO that some clubs have too much emphasis on competitions.  Only a small fraction of adults that start training judo at an ""old"" age is interesting in putting in the effort to compete.  The risk of getting injured is too great.

It sickens me that two of the best fighters on earth (Ronda and Fedor) both use a TON of Judo (Ronda almost 100% and Fedor a LOT) and yet there exists no cross-promotion to capitalize.  I swear to God I could rebrand Judo in a second in this country (USA).  Commercials during major sporting events consisting of quick cuts of the most exciting throws on earth by incredibly adept Judoka IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE- from MMA to the Olympics to an obvious self-defense situation in the street- throw after throw after throw after tap after tap after tap.

judo,3bifmo,dave_attenburz,-1,Mon Jun 29 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"Moreover, 'hasn't managed to die yet' isn't as much of an accomplishment as actively obtaining a rank. I'm not sure why age should be of concern in the dojo."
judo,3bifmo,bear-knuckle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"And why should ""rank"" be a concern in the dojo and not skills? I threw shodans and nidans left and right, when I was a brown  belt and for sure knew more about Judo then they did.   If a completly beginner like a white or a yellow belt trains in a Dojo even he is 40 years old, he has to follow the instructions of the teacher who is 20 years old and a shodan BUT a 20 year old can not treat a 40 year old like a 15 year old. That has to do with respect. Judo is not limited to the Dojo, its not in a ""cage"" like MMA. Judo is a part of society and the highest goal of Judo is to contribute to society. Put this to an extreme: If the Prime Minister of Japan or the Emperor is visiting the Dojo of Jigoro Kano and wants to participate in training, Kano would bow to the prime minister. If Mifunes father is visiting the Dojo to learn from his son some Judo ""tricks"" Mifune would bow to his father, even Mifune is 10th dan.  You have to put the ""respect thing"" in a social perspectice and not only look at Judo rank and Dojo."

Maybe I'm just being to generous in my interpretation, but I think he meant that MMA, like most martial arts, is limited to the environment in which training and competition are conducted, whereas judo is ""supposed to be"" a part of your being and everyday life. Which isn't to say that MMA fighters or jiujiteiros don't respect each other, just that we don't have any moral principles handed down to us by a Kano figure. And that's both fair and true. We view MMA as a skillset, not a way of life. It doesn't exist outside of the fight.   It's like a Christian saying ""as Christians, we should strive to be honest and upright."" That doesn't imply that atheists like me aren't honest, just that Christians have a universal code to meet. Now, whether judo should function as a religion complete with a prophet and saints (What Would Kano Do?) is an entirely different issue, but I don't think he meant any disrespect."

Judoka don't have some kind of immunity to this granted by the moral guidance of Jigoro Kano; like all athletes, they do what they can get away with, and if judo really is completely clean (something I very much doubt) it's because of the governing body, not the inherent character of the athletes.   Look at Hector Lombard, MMA fighter and 4th dan, world champion judoka. He popped for steroids in January and is under a one-year suspension. Where were the teachings of Kano when he was shooting up? Judoka aren't special, we're human and there are those among us who will cut corners if they think it could earn them $100,000 in FOTN + KO/SOTN bonuses.   The UFC just implemented a much more stringent drug testing plan, so steroid use is about to become a lot less frequent.

And the change in strenght performance with roids is huuuuge. If you do 3 twelve week cycles with roids in 18 months at an average you will be 15kg heavier AND this as a very advanced athlete (muscle - not fat) and 100 - 130 lb stronger in bench press.   The very talented guy without roids - training even harder and with less regeneration - only has gained +5kg and 40lbs. I say thats unfair and its cheating.

At every one of them, ""tournament Judo"" under ""tournament rules"" has been the norm.  I cannot believe that 28 out of 56 clubs practice moves that- if done in Shiai- result in an automatic, total ban.  It's just not possible.  I'm betting some on here are counting, say, dicking around after practice and/or doing BJJ in the same dojo (or MMA, or wrestling, or what have you) and, as such, being allowed to do pick ups and leg grabs.

judo,3bi5v5,ldzman218,2,Mon Jun 29 12:42:18 2015 UTC,"Go for it! Judo and BJJ are almost the same martial art. Judo is 80% throwing and 20% ground fighting, while BJJ is the exact opposite.  The vast majority of what you learn in BJJ will be useful for judo. There are some minor rule differences (BJJ is more permissive: you can touch the opponent's face, you can apply shoulder and wrist locks, etc.).   Also, BJJ players tend to spend a lot of time working on a specific position called ""the guard"", which is when one fighter is between the other person's legs. Both fighters have a bunch of options in that situation, and it's practically the default situation in a BJJ match.  Judokas learn about grappling in the guard too, but it's not really a common situation in judo competitions, so we don't work nearly as much on it.  Ground fighting in judo follows the same principles as in BJJ, but there are a few key differences.  In BJJ, you have all the time in the world to work. Fights become highly technical chess matches between two competitors trying to find openings for a plethora of sweeps and submissions.  For a judoka, ground fighting is what you do after a throw. You focus on the transition between standing and ground grappling. You try to retain control of your opponent, land in an advantageous position and quickly submit or pin him. The rules of judo favor quick, explosive  and relatively crude grappling. If there's no progress after a few seconds, the referee calls a halt and stands you up.   In BJJ you will probably train some takedowns. They will be very basic, low risk, and mostly a quick and dirty way of taking the fight to the ground.  Judo doesn't do takedowns, we learn throws. The difference between a takedown and a throw is that if you do a throw right, the fight is over. In a judo match, it's an instant win. In MMA or self defense, your opponent is badly hurt and you are in a superior position. Some of the techniques you learn in BJJ are currently illegal in judo competitions (but many clubs still teach them). Some of the techniques you learn in judo are risky to use in BJJ."

To have ALL that packed into one video is pretty amazing, which is why I suddenly love this guy. Never heard of him before.  The only slight error he makes is his definition of de-ashi-barai ('advancing' foot sweep). It actually has nothing to do with advancing, per-say. 'De' (出) comes from the verb 'deru' (出る), which means to 'depart', 'about to leave' or 'to make an appearance', not necessarily in a forward direction. 'De-ashi' implies that the foot is departing, hence the weight is either about to be transferred off the foot, or about to be transferred onto the foot, but is swept right before. This means that de-ashi-barai can be done on an advancing leg, and an retreating one, which we already know, but is not reflected in the English translation of the technique. Perhaps we should call it 'departing-foot-sweep' instead? :P  The first thing that struck me was his mention of 'hiji-no-ri' (elbow management), which was new to me. I've never seen this mentioned in a Judo sense before, but I have seen mention of 'teko-no-ri' (principle of leverage), which is applied in many situations. CK has mentioned himegoto-no-ri (秘事の理), 'himegoto' seems to be a similar word to 'hiji', so I dunno. The second thing was his explanation of hiki-te and tsuri-te. I've always been under the impression that the sleeve-hand was called hiki-te regardless of using it to pull or the otherway around, as in an opposite grip sasae-tsurikomi-ashi for example. I need to look into that, I'm not sure."

judo,3bewqx,dave_attenburz,4,Sun Jun 28 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the premise that stand-up grappling should theoretically be more complex than groundwork. Even in arts less restrictive in their rules (like Sambo), stand-up grappling simply has fewer techniques. Stand-up grappling has very few functional submissions while grounded grappling has hundreds. There exist more grounded sweeps than takedowns. This is universally known.   There are more positions available because your legs, which are dedicated to remaining standing in judo or wrestling, are now free to act as a second set of arms. Plus there's the additional factor of weight pressure, which opens up a variety of positional options as well as enabling the use of many submissions that could not be completed otherwise."
judo,3bewqx,bear-knuckle,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:23:13 2015 UTC,"I think I could concede that, when viewed in that manner. In theory, standing up should allow for more degrees of freedom but perhaps only in the abstract."
judo,3bewqx,PartyPope,-1,Mon Jun 29 16:01:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry, but I don't agree. The only reason why BJJ seems to have so many moves is because applying a technique from a different position is considered a ""new"" move.   So there are a 100 ways to do omoplata (ashi-sankaku-garami), but it is the same technique, whether you get it from half guard, full guard, spider,... That would be like saying that an ippon seoi from an armpit grip or lapel grip is a different thrown than doing it from a sleeve grip. Kouchi into Seoi for example is still a seoi and not a Fujii. Counter a failed ouchi with a seoi -> still a seoi."
judo,3bewqx,erangalp,2,Sun Jun 28 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"I practice mainly BJJ - we don't call techniques performed from different positions by different names. An armbar is an armbar, an omoplata is an omoplata, doesn't matter where you enter it from. Yes, there are armbar variations (armbar from guard, armbar from mount, etc) - those are all still called an armbar.   What /u/bear-knuckle was referring to was the multitude of different basic positions, which are available because of gravity and the proximity to the ground. Positions such as side-control, guard, mount, etc, are all fundamentally different, with their own set of entries, maintenance, progression and submissions. Each of those has multiple significant variations too.  But where complexity really ramps up in BJJ is in the guard, where 70% of the time is spent (crude estimate). Guard work - sweeps, submissions, positions and guard passing have so much breadth that one can study those decades and never know everything there is to know about it."
judo,3bewqx,PartyPope,2,Mon Jun 29 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"When I was in the US I did BJJ for a year, because the Judo clubs were trash, so I do have a pretty good idea about BJJ. I should mention that I have been doing Judo for 20 years and have competed ever since my 3rd year. I am a ""scrambler"" type player.  Of course the game feels very different when you play against De la riva, Spider, Reverse De la Riva, X-Guard,... (though I never had a fucking clue wtf this guy was talking about at the start). Essentially they are the same thing though. Let me explain to you why:   For me there are just two significant positions in BJJ. The guy who is looking to pass is either standing or kneeling. That's like kenka-yotsu/ai-yotsu (left vs right)/(right vs right) in Judo. Of course there is a difference between regular sleeve lapel grip and a same-sided sleeve lapel grip (cross gripping). Closed guard is comparable with a power grip and a rubber/octopus guard is comparable with a power grip, when you have, additionally, broken the opponents posture. Back mount is like a 2:0 grip situation, etc. The defenses against sweeps, arm bars (knee, wrist, calv, biceps), chokes stay the same regardless of the position.  When I started to do BJJ, I just passed every guard the same way: Kill the collar grip/sleeve grip on the side I am looking to pass -> launch into half guard or knee pass -> cross and kill the half guard -> establish side control/kesa gatame/mount, and from there I was always better."
judo,3bewqx,erangalp,2,Mon Jun 29 12:19:13 2015 UTC,"A year working on guard is barely scratching the surface... I've been working on it for over 9 (brown belt), and still discovering new things every day.   I attended a class with Saulo Ribeiro (if you don't know who that is, google him) the other day, and he was showing a position from closed guard - one of the basic positions you learn in BJJ. And he absolutely blew my mind (and most of the other participants). And I can assure you everything he shows is super basic, not some of the fancy new stuff that's been flying around.  Afterwards, he told us - ""Don't be worried if the position feels a bit unnatural at first. I've been working on this position for 25 years."" This is the kind of mindset you need to explore positions in BJJ.  We're going off topic here - I was originally just trying to address your claim that the meta game in BJJ is only deep because they name the same techniques 100 different ways depending on position, which is simply not true."
judo,3bewqx,PartyPope,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"Look I'm not claiming that BJJ is not deep, quite the opposite actually. I guess I worded it poorly, or maybe you just got the Omoplata in the wrong throat.  I tried to compare BJJ and Judo and if I had degraded BJJ I would have also degraded Judo, which makes no sense. They have the same origins and just specialized differently through their competitive aspect. There is also a difference in how the two are taught. In Judo training the focus is on the basics, while BJJ is more focused on specialization. Sure basic drills are an important part of BJJ as well, but they are not as pronounced as in Judo.  When you like a specific guard, you usually have more experience playing that guard, than your opponent has passing it, right? So when I did BJJ, I tried to create situations that I was familiar with from my Judo and since I knew those better (20 years of experience), I excelled at those situations. Sure, when your opponent is experienced, he will have spend quite a bit of time passing your guard as well, but his knowledge is not as deep as yours is.   And yeah my passing game is definetly better than my guard. Also I was at one of Shaolin's dojos, maybe you need to google him. Sorry, but I really had to do that ;)  My point is, that most people don't even grasp the finer aspects of Judo, because they are stuck on the basics. Our standing is just as developped as your ground work."

My standing is super rudimentary and I have no place making commentary on Judo.   maybe you just got the Omoplata in the wrong throat.   Whatever that means, I have no idea. Doesn't sound good though. Peace out"
judo,3bewqx,PartyPope,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"Welp, I guess we were saying the same thing all along. What I meant to say was: Judo and BJJ are equally deep and that they have a different focus, but that it is easier to realize the depths in BJJ because the teaching is different.  I, accidently, seem to have annoyed/triggered you with the Omoplata thing. Marceloplata and Baratoplata are variations just like the Huizinga roll.  I believe there are more ""preacher"" types of BJJ instructors, who claim that their style is the best/most efficient/most inventive... Most of them are full of shit (cough octopus and rubbish guard). There is a counter to everything and the longer a chain is, the less likely it is to work. Sure there is a surprise factor, but you have it exactly once against good players. You can show off against worse opponents, but that's it.  BJJ is still maturing though, so there are huge skill gaps between competitors and there have only been a few years of high level tournaments. I think it is too easy to stall in BJJ though.   One last thing: if you were in Europe you'd do Judo because BJJ is non-existant. Judo on the other hand is almost non-existant in the US."
judo,3bewqx,Ryvai,6,Mon Jun 29 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"The president of the Kodokan announced in his new-year speech that they are working on some additional techniques to add to their syllabus, expanding on the total list of 67 techniques (principles).   The Kodokans official list of techniques are principles, were plenty of variations fit into one 'category' or family of techniques. For example, ko-uchi-gari has several variations that has been given 'names', like; daki-kouchi, ko-uchi-sutemi, ko-uchi-makikomi, ko-uchi-gake and so on, but they are still ko-uchi-gari, because they fit into that official category of 'principle'.   The thing is, we don't want to dilute the meaning of categorization of Judo techniques. The 'zantaraya uchimata' is still an uchimata. I have no problem with someone teaching a class this technique by name, but it is important to tell the students in the following way; ""What I'm about to show you is a variation of tsurikomi-goshi, which is sometimes called the 'explosive-cactus-makikomi'"". If we stop telling them what category it fits into, we will loose the entire meaning of categorization.  The problem they face in BJJ is the same as the one in the medical world. If a doctor suggests, during a differential diagnosis, I believe the patient has Dunning–Kruger disorder. The other doctors have no idea what that is unless they have read about it and actually knows what that exact term means. If someone tells you do the 'explosive cactus' move in BJJ, you would have no clue how to do it, unless you've been shown that move or read about it. It doesn't tell you anything about the move itself, it's just a pet name. This is why the terminology is, most of the time with some exceptions, very descriptive of what you are about to do. But then again, the Kodokan system is not perfect, it has several flaws. Hopefully, this will be better in the future. We'll have to see what the Kodokan does with the 'new' terminology proposal they are working on."

Now, of course, if you've been doing Judo for some time, and have seen a given move (say, o-soto gari) a number of times, and practiced applying it, then if you travel anywhere, and they ask you to perform that move by name, then you'll be able to do it, but the same is true of the majority of the moves in BJJ.  A kimura is a kimura, and triangle is a triangle, and so on.  It's mostly the newer/more esoteric techniques, or variations on an established technique, that aren't immediately recognizable to anyone having done BJJ for any length of time."

judo,3bewqx,Anthropolygon,3,Mon Jun 29 00:06:42 2015 UTC,"Why does it appear so?   The trend in Judo (perhaps since inception) has been the negation of available techniques. Judo has become less dynamic as a result.    we're discussing the complexities of standing vs groundwork Judo vs. BJJ.   If we look at leg locks for example, there is a cluster of techniques and depths of nuance, variations on attacks, defenses, etc. This represents an entire subset of grappling art that are wholly absent in Judo, because leg locks are not allowed.   Then there are the dangerous, but useful standing techniques like Kami basami, Kawazu gake that are no longer available because of the increased risk of injury.  Commonly lamented and more recent is the loss of lower body grips. The new rules killed leg grabs like Merote gari, as well as throws that require a secondary attack to be made to the legs like Kata guruma. These techniques were once a huge segment of the overall game of Judo and are no longer possible.  Standing techniques in Judo are also severely limited by grip regulations...  Basically, the trend in Judo is away from innovation and towards uniformity. Standardization of techniques, limited to the big, dramatic throws like uchimata. Conversely, BJJ has been trending towards fewer rules and more innovation. Though I question the insistence on declaring every guard/pass/sweep/submission a new technique."
judo,3bewqx,bear-knuckle,-2,Sun Jun 28 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure I agree. If anything, I'd say the new rules make it harder to stall and thus encourage judoka to be more dynamic.  But never mind all that. How about a list of new and interesting variations that people have noticed popping up (legs grabs or no leg grabs be damned). I haven't paid much attention but it seems as if reverse seoinage, sasae and no-leg grab kata guruma are on the rise? It also seems as if more time is being allowed on the ground (so long as progress is shown). We're starting to see some interesting newaza techniques creep in.

The more limitations you put on something, the less it evolves. The new rules may make it a little more exciting to watch for spectators (not to me) but they limit innovation. The lack of leg grips destroys an entire dimension of judo that could be progressing and evolving right now. You're right that there are still innovations, but it could be innovating so much more if there weren't such restrictive rules.   You can look at a bonsai and say, ""see? Even though it has restrictions, it grows."" But put it next to a natural tree for comparison and you'll see how meaningless that statement is."
judo,3bewqx,Ryvai,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"I can see your point. OTOH, the argument could be made that the restrictions are going to drive evolution. Eg: It's still an arms race (in shiai) after all....and with less tools to play with...how can we make these tools serve a wider set of circumstances?  Just throwing that out there as an alternative read of the text :)"
judo,3bewqx,PoachedEggsOnToast,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:07:39 2015 UTC,"By that logic, we could evolve judo by restricting judo to te-waza only. With fewer techniques to work on, the refinement of the techniques would be much higher than with a larger variety to choose from. But judo would be way shittier for it.   Limiting techniques isn't ""driving"" evolution, just guiding it. Yes, people will focus their efforts at innovation if you narrow the techniques, but people will innovate their favorite techniques anyway because competition drives experimentation. The only difference now is that many people's favorite techniques are now illegal, which means they have to start innovating at square 1 with techniques that they don't understand or are not supported by their body types.   You don't take an astrophysicist from his research, put him in a biology lab, force him to do biological research and call it ""growth."" That's a net loss - you just took a valuable specialist from his effective role to give him an ineffective role in another person's area of expertise. People leave judo because of things like this.   And the evolution squashed by the technique-banning isn't even limited to techniques themselves. The tactical landscape is damaged as well. The core metagame of judo is leading an opponent into a position where you can capitalize, and with fewer cards to play, the fewer setups we get, which makes judo less useful and less interesting."
judo,3bewqx,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"Sure - I was mostly taking the devil's advocate position there for fun :) Re: limiting judo to tewaza, fewer cards etc; has anyone who's reviewed something like Kurash able to comment? My (western) understanding is that Kurash is very niche but is essentially judo tachiwaza sans leg grabs and sans any kind of newaza."

There was a loop-hole in the definition of the rules a while back, when Gerbi won that tournament, that made it possible to 'interpret' it as legal, but that was quickly rectified to clearly state that that any use of the lapel-end (suso) is not allowed. You can see many variations of this, search YouTube for suso-jime. These are currently not allowed because of safety concerns :)   The current loop-hole (in my opinion), is this variation of okuri-eri-jime. The rules say that it is not allowed to place your foot inside your own or opponents gi, but I've asked high ranking IJf referee about this specific move, and he could not say that this was illegal. I've used it ever since I saw it a long time ago, I can't confirm the legality of it though."

judo,3bewqx,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:12:44 2015 UTC,"Off topic:  Sorry, but what is a ""dimelo roll""? If you have a youtube link to a proper example, I'd like to add it to my list of odd&new techniques.  On topic:  I think the problem in Judo is not the innovation regarding throws. People come up with new throws (or at least variants) all the time. What I am missing in Judo is not more throws, but the didactic tools to learn and teach them properly.  If I go to two different clubs, and have the teacher in chief show me the same basic technique, I'll get two different descriptions, both often flawed in different aspects. Some will teach a static setup, others will teach a dynamic setup. And often neither is tailored well for the group it is taught to. There's also the ""chinese whispers game""/""tradition"" problem: Often details are taught in certain ways, but no one knows why that is supposed to be the best way to do it and maybe it is not the best way at all?   What most instructors lack is a plan, as in how to progress from a static form, through various dynamic forms to a completely free form.  What many instructions for throws lack is a ""how to get there"" concept. In BJJ there's a huge emphasis on transitions. You don't only practice the armbar, you practice how to get there as well.  There's a huge difference between ne waza and tachi waza though, The drilled setups on the ground usually have a higher percentage to work than any setup for a standing technique, mostly because there are more dimensions of freedom in tachi waza. Tachi waza is less predictable and makes coming up with foolproof setup really difficult.  Recently I thought I found a really sweet setup for Tai Otoshi. It worked really well. Then I switched to a different uke, who reacted differently and it didn't work anymore."

judo,3be83h,sketchfest,8,Sun Jun 28 23:00:43 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab:   BJJ currently has greater exposure and relevance in mixed martial arts, which is a huge sport in the US and many places. People have argued that the BJJ meta-game has greater depth, so there are more question and discussion threads. Many of these discuss videos on YouTube that well-known practitioners put up and actively promote. New BJJ techniques are also being discovered all the time, probably at a greater rate than in Judo. A lot of people are just getting into BJJ, hence the many posts about etiquette, never mind the ""first class"" and ""first stripe"" posts. I'm not aware of many judo events, but BJJ events seem to be marketed quite well. There's usually plenty of hype and discussion around matches between well-known competitors. There's more drama in the BJJ community.   It'd be nice to get some solid stats though on the number of practitioners for each discipline (in say the US)."

Metamoris 1 Metamoris 5 - Renzo vs Sakuraba Mendes brothers at a tournament, by their sponsors   It doesn't hurt either that there's so more overlap between BJJ and other grappling styles. Also the old Gracie challenge match videos were marketed as ""style vs style"" and ""strength vs technique""."
judo,3be83h,bozo78,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:30:13 2015 UTC,Has judo not been marketed? Why not?
judo,3be83h,michachu,2,Sun Jun 28 22:59:50 2015 UTC,"Because Kano was against the commercialization of Judo and the Japanese mostly still uphold this ideal to this day.  Originally training at the Kodokan was free (if I am not informed wrongly) and Kano only reluctantly introduced low fees for the upkeep of the dojo.  There were attempts at introducing professional Judo (prize fighting), but it was always frowned upon.  Personally I understand Kano's point of view. Judo should be accessable for everyone. Also as soon as big money gets involved, it attracts the wrong people. Another thing I'd dislike to see would be excessive ads, patches and everything that's loud and showy in the context of Judo. It would take away a lot from the humbleness and dignity our art has preserved at least in some places.  Some guys in the IJF seem trying to get such elements into Judo through the backdoor. Look for that Europe vs Asia Judo event on youtube for example. Lot's of show and spotlights... it just doesn't feel right."
judo,3be83h,Pedro_Hizzo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:40:36 2015 UTC,"Right. BJJ seems to market a lot more aggressively, I just looked it up. They also seem quite fond of chokes, not sure why."
judo,3be83h,michachu,0,Mon Jun 29 06:58:58 2015 UTC,I have to agree the meta game is deeper in BJJ. Judo concentrates heavily on one position - standing. BJJ concentrates on multiple positions.
judo,3be83h,duchessHS,2,Sun Jun 28 13:54:11 2015 UTC,"Standing is ""one position""? As for meta-game...while BJJ is more intricate overall, it's not as if we're exactly cavemen :) There are entire areas of groundwork (turnovers, turtle attacks, transitions) that judo probably does a lot better than BJJ.  Back to meta game idea though: I have to admit that until BJJScout & Judo Mat Lab etc there was generally very little ""meta game"" public discussion. It seems to me that BJJers tend to be more cerebral whereas judoka tend to be ""jocks"". ICBW."

judo,3be83h,Demaculus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:02:42 2015 UTC,Yeah the whole stall for time thing. A Judo brown belt visited my BJJ academy recently. While I was mauling him repeatedly he eventually just turned over on his stomach and just tried to lay as flat and turtled as possible in the middle of an 8 minute round. The guy was definitely exceptionally strong and explosive for sure. But I think it definitely helped that he was 230lbs.

judo,3be83h,RatioFitness,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:43:03 2015 UTC,Not saying Judo metagame is simple - it's simply not as deep as BJJ's.  /u/bear-knuckle articulated it quite well here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/2vahyi/bjj_guy_here_about_to_start_formal_judo_classes/cog2njw
judo,3be83h,bozo78,2,Sun Jun 28 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"Are we talking judo standing vs bjj ground? Or judo ground vs BJJ ground? If the latter, sure - BJJ's playbook is generally deeper, barring some niche exceptions. Not sure how we'd compare the sophistication of judo standing to bjj ground though (if that's the comparison). Given there are more degrees of freedom in standing than on the floor, I'd like to think they were comparable. However, judo is less about attack, counter and recounter and more about the interplay of forces between techniques, attack initiative, movement and force management. It's less of a IF-THEN decision tree compared to bjj but I'm not quite sure how to describe it. What say others?"
judo,3be83h,Judostu,4,Sun Jun 28 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"Given there are more degrees of freedom in standing than on the floor   I think this is where I'd disagree. I'm struggling to think of an analogy to illustrate it, but gravity plays a big part.  If I'm standing, I'm either on one or two feet. I have balance because I've protected my vulnerable plane, and the moment that plane is exposed and exploited I go to the ground - and when I'm on the ground, I'm no longer standing, i.e. the game is no longer ""Judo stand-up"". Hence there is this need to maintain balance, which is a constraint that places a physical limit on the number of ways I can arrange my arms and legs to manipulate my opponent.  When I'm close to the ground (be it on my butt, my back, one foot and one knee, etc) my center of gravity is low, my base is wide, and keeping my balance is infinitely easier. Because keeping balance is easier, there are so many more ways I can move, never mind arrange my arms and legs, around my opponent. I can attack with all 4 limbs at once because none of them comprise my base. As for mobility, you might ask yourself: when was the last time you went behind your opponent in Judo?  For those reasons I'd say the BJJ ground game is combinatorially ""deeper"" than Judo stand up, on the physical level. If we were sparring in a space station, maybe the number would even up.  Then there are the rules:   In BJJ losing my balance doesn't lose me the game, whether it's a a clean throw from standing or a half guard sweep. The match keeps going until submission or time runs out. If you don't have a time limit for ground work, you can spend time setting up traps and wearing your opponent down. BJJ allows you to grab the legs, and in general the rules are less strict than in Judo.   I'm sure someone else can think of a nicer analogy for it, but that's the best I can put it right now.  Not to say ""depth"" in a game is everything. The below is more true for sport BJJ:   BJJ has taken a rap for the community glorifying exotic techniques (see ""berimbolo""), and you'll see beginners keenly seeking these out to best their less informed peers. It can be a crappy, gimmicky knowledge arms race. BJJ athletes are in general also not very athletic. The sport BJJ ruleset (IBJJF at least) isn't exactly in sync with what's practical in self-defense situations, or even MMA rulesets.   It's not new to hear that the above undermine BJJ's credibility as a self-defense discipline. You could be an Olympic-level Judoka and be terrific at defending yourself, but pulling that world-class deep half in a street fight is asking to have my head caved in."
judo,3be83h,bozo78,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:01:50 2015 UTC,Have you seen BJJ athletes? And having world class deep half means having world class BJJ. I don't see a world class BJJ guy having their head caved in. But. I see your point as you can be a shity practitioner or a dumb fuck and try berimbolo or something and get kicked in the balls.
judo,3be83h,stuckoverhere,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:03:04 2015 UTC,"At the tail end they're very comparable of course (someone in another thread cited Palhares and Damien Maia), but on average a judoka will have better strength and conditioning, the same way wrestlers are generally more fit than BJJers because of the rulesets they play to.  It's not just that though - I'd argue Judoka and wrestlers will have better timing, balance, and sensitivity. It's not to say these don't exist in BJJ - they're simply not as critical when you can just go to another branch on your decision tree."
judo,3be83h,bozo78,2,Mon Jun 29 06:15:31 2015 UTC,"I've also noticed that in a lot of videos of street fights you can see online, where allegedly one of the participants knows BJJ, you often see the BJJ practitioner get taken down by the street guy with no training. Of course, the BJJ guy usually ends up winning off his back, but in my opinion, getting taken down by some chump is absolutely not something that should happen to a trained fighter. The BJJ guys who don't train judo or wrestling seriously are missing out.  I train both judo and BJJ, and I love both so not trying to say jujutsu sucks or anything."
judo,3be83h,stuckoverhere,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:06:20 2015 UTC,Not that BJJ guys nee to train wrestling or judo to learn takedown. BJJ has takedowns. They just seem to get neglected at some schools.

I don't mind the super light warm up but it's a task when I have to find more time to drill or go work out.
judo,3be83h,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Mon Jun 29 06:39:35 2015 UTC,"That is a great comparison, not taking away from either, just stating and breaking down the different goals of each sport.  As a BJJ guy who dabbles in Judo when its offered this seems like a very accurate description."

judo,3be83h,fedornuthugger,2,Mon Jun 29 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"""Judo concentrates heavily on one position - standing. BJJ concentrates on multiple positions.""  Judo is split between standing and groundfighting.  It is BJJ that has a heavy concentration on groundfighting."
judo,3be83h,JudokaYasha,7,Mon Jun 29 06:04:12 2015 UTC,"Another angle to consider - demographics. It seem that in the West, the largest grouping of judoka tend to be pre-teens...with then a huge drop off in teens, before we see seniors (40+). Not many start judo between the ages of 18-35, the generation considered internet savvy.   I would imagine that pre-teens generally don't go in for nit picky conversations of judo and that most in their 40's have better things to do with limited spare time.  So, what's left is the few of us that are <40 but >12, which historically is a small slice of the pie.  BJJ OTOH is full of guys 18-35 year olds - the  generation that is considered 'digitally native'; comfortable / use to using things like Facebook, reddit etc to communicate.   Looking at the front pages alone, I can see that r/bjj has 28,982 members whereas r/judo has barely a 1/4 of that (7,072).  Also...the online judo community somewhat fractured after judoforum.com died in 2011. At its peak, JF could have between 300 to 3000 members logging in at once and chatting on multiple topics. It was a treasure trove of content (I tried to download the site the other day and had to stop after 2 days and 20gb).    I have no idea where those people went (clearly not here)...but when JF died, we lost a large online community that has as yet to be rehomed.   Having said all that...if the stats are true and correct...this is now probably the largest online presence of judoka. We've gone almost full circle from LISTSERV, to USENET, to EZboard forums, to Facebook and now Reddit.   My $0.02"
judo,3bdb0s,lambdeer,7,Sun Jun 28 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"First of all, I envy you. That's one awesome opportunity to learn Judo right there. Absorb as much knowledge as possible while you're there. When it comes to this person, he needs to be disciplined, for his own sake. If it's high-school judo he is probably young? We all know how teenagers can behave, and they need discipline.  If there is one thing that Judoka has in common, it's discipline, over yourself and your emotions. At least that is what we strive for. The maxim Jita-kyoei is all about mutual prosperity and welfare. This person should be taught a lesson in humility by his sensei or senpai. He will grow that way, as a person. You are demonstrating a good example in my opinion, but this person should change his behavior.   ""..The continued development of group life and social life is attained by sojo sojo (mutual help and mutual compromise) and jita kyoei. Therefore, this is also a virtue and is the fundamental meaning of Judo"" -Jigoro Kano   I'd be careful with such individuals. Imagine if he had caught you in shime-waza or kansetsu-waza. I'd be surprised if he had let go in time if you had tapped, just to prove a point to you, which is very dangerous. If he had held on for too long he could have hurt you. We roll with each other based on trust, trust in the person we roll with, that they will protect you -- as you protect them from harm. You're Judoka, not savages."

What's the usual mode on ne-waza randori there? Going 100%?  What kind of place do you train at? High profile for athletes or more an everyman's place for all levels?

judo,3balat,SuperDuckMan,15,Sat Jun 27 10:44:59 2015 UTC,"Is there something wrong I'm doing in kuzushi?   Yes.  But before you despair: We all do. It's just after years of training some of us do less so to some extend.  Kuzushi is a difficult thing to do. Think about this: Humans are -as far as I can think of- the only animal that walks most of the time upright on two legs and has no tail or anything like that to keep balanced. We need years to learn walking and running on two legs and the body we use for that is the result of millions of years of evolutionary optimization via natural selection. Tricking that finely tuned system into failing is incredibly hard, especially against another judoka.  The basic eight directions balance breaking (happo no kuzushi) is an overly simplified didactic tool that is vastly insufficient to understand what's necessary to really unbalance someone for a throw.  What to do?   Exaggerate your opponents movements. This is a most basic idea of Judo: Use your opponents strength and momentum against him. Try not to stop or slow down his movents (except you do that as in point 71 ), exaggerate and redirect them in a way useful to you. Avoid strong or abrupt pulling and pushing when you do this, because it will trigger immediate resistance, unless you go for what I describe in point number 2, or he is beyond the point of no return (resistance will be futuile or too late). Destabilization by reaction (Hando no Kuzushi) To keep or regain his/her balance your opponent has to react to your pushing and pulling actions. Push or pull into the opposite direction of the technique you want to use first. Feel for a counter reaction and exploit it if it happens. Abruptness helps here a lot, because abrupt pushing or pulling usually triggers defensive reflexes. Combinations & Continunity: Kuzushi against a resisting opponent  is, as mentioned, very hard. Don't give up after the first attempt though, try continous attacks, chain different techniques to combinations. Provoke reactions via attacks, ""hunt"" your opponent as long as you feel you are in control of the situation. Only stop attacking if you feel like losing control and reset yourself to a safe stance. Use the third dimension. Kuzushi not only works in the horizontal plane but also incorporates vertical manipulation of your opponent and movements of your own body. Pulling your opponent down or up can be useful as well as lowering your own center of mass in certain situations. All this can be combined with the points 1, 2 and 3! Circles! The human ability to move on two legs becomes quite a challenge when we move fast in small circles, use this to your advantage. Kumi Kata and Movement restrictions: A good grip will take away movement options from your opponent and keep him from escaping or resisting. Twisting and applying torque to his body will limit his his freedom of movement for example. Understanding weaknesses: If you connect your opponent's feet via an imaginary line, pulling or pushing at a 90° angle to that line will force him to move. If you can block that movement somehow he'll fall. Also note: 1 Kuzushi happens when the lower body does not move at the same speed as the upper body. This can be used in many, many ways!  Rhythm and dynamic interruption: The timing and force of your step pattern makes a difference. If you move synchronous with your opponent, he'll be able to evade easily, if you suddenly break out of that rhythm he'll have a much more difficult time. When you enter for an attack and need more than one step for that, save your energy for the last step, don't waste it on the first one. Go tap-tap-TAP for example not TAP-TAP-tap. Entries. Work on your entries. Make them fluent. Try to achieve really quick entries. Open mindedness: Keep an open mind, be relaxed, don't aim at using a certain technique, but use what suits the situation. Don't telegraph your intentions to your opponent by being stiff or trying the same thing over and over. Be the dead calm heart of the storm.    Also, do I need any strength to do (good) kuzushi?   Strength is usually helpful, but good Judo shouldn't rely on it. If you are technically superior to your opponent, you can compensate quite a lot of difference in strength.  EDIT: I added an important exception to point 1. I'd also like to point out, that many points need further explanation."

judo,3balat,Toptomcat,3,Sat Jun 27 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"The above is excellent, and it touches on this in places, but there's one thing I'd like to make more explicit: the importance of speed. If you fluidly and immediately transition from your kuzushi to your actual throw, leaving your opponent no time to take a step between the kuzushi and the throw, then you'll have better results. They really shouldn't be discernibly separate motions: kuzushi and the throw are separated for teaching purposes but in practice it should all happen at once."

Try and break the stiff arming habit as soon as possible. It's the same as BJJ, the sooner you do that, the quicker you'll learn.   Learn your ukemi and relax whilst being thrown. It doesn't hurt if you breakfall correctly.   Other than that, I can't think of anything major you should be doing straight away. Enjoy it, it's a great compliment to BJJ; I did it the other way around."

judo,3b8r5n,Anthony126517,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:57:37 2015 UTC,"I’ve just started cross training in BJJ and one of the things I hear white being told in BJJ is to “survive”. It seems like white belt in BJJ is all about toughing it out (when rolling) and learning how to defend against submissions. Obviously once you get a little better you will start to tap the newer white belts but generally speaking you get tapped a lot.  In contrast to that Judo white belts are treated very nice and gently. In randori people will let you throw them (yes if you throw higher belts in your first few months they let you). What I tried to do as a beginner was to attack in randori and not to worry about being thrown (kind of the opposite of what a white belt in BJJ does). Obviously you’ll do well once it hits the ground but remember to learn the pins. You can submit people with a crushing pin.   Other than that, what some of the other guys have already said. Relax, don't bend over, take the fall when thrown and don't fight it, that leads to injury."

judo,3b8r5n,dzendian,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:38:40 2015 UTC,"What the others said are great.  I'd like to add one etiquette thing that bothers my sensei to no end: don't fist bump or slap hands like BJJ guys seem to do.  In judo you bow before and after randori and newaza.  You may only shake hands AFTERWARD and only after bowing.  Try to make sure you're wearing a white or blue gi.  My incredibly traditional sensei doesn't mind a purple or black gi, but he will stop class to talk about why you wear a white gi and what would happen if you wore that non-white/non-blue gi to a tournament.  Also, learn the rules.  Look at the IJF 2014 judo rules.  Try not to violate the rules while you're in the dojo.  Try not to do arm-locks as a judo novice unless your instructor allows you to.  Ask first if in doubt.  Work on your natural/upright posture.  It serves a purpose in judo."
judo,3b8r5n,liftinheavythings,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"Relax. Grip properly (use the correct fingers). Don't fight for grips, you have no idea what you're doing and it'll just be flapping at your partner. At Hajime just grip up, sleeve and lapel (or whatever you've been shown) and go from there. Relax again. Think about the techniques you've been shown, don't just try and bundle uke over. Also, relax. Did I mention relaxing?  Make sure you learn your ukemi. If you have faith in your ukemi, and accept you're going to get thrown (training is not competition!), then guess what happens? You relax.  The advice that I know no beginner will ever follow, but I personally think is probably the best way to get introduced to judo - in randori, make absolutely no attempt to throw your partner for the first few training sessions. Assuming your sessions are set up with demonstrations and nagekomi etc, you'll have time to practice them there. But when it comes to randori, you need to understand movement. Judo comes from movement. By working with better partners, and feeling the movement, and taking your throws you'll get a better feel for what the art entails than doing what every beginner in the world does, that is trying half-arsed ogoshis against resisting partners and then doing some messed up bundle-waza. Also, it'll help you relax, which as you might have noticed is kinda important."

He was a 10th dan in Aikido, 9th dan in jujutsu, 8th dan in iaido, 8th dan in judo, 8th dan in kobudo, 5th dan in kendo, 5th dan in karate, and a 5th dan in jojutsu.   Born in Shizuoka, Japan, Mochizuki was one of the direct students of judo founder Jigoro Kano, aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba and Gichin Funakoshi, founder of Shotokan Karate.   Believing that the martial arts had become distorted by specialization into separate disciplines or transformed into sports, Mochizuki achievement was to assemble back the major techniques of the Japanese martial tradition into a single structure, as it was once practised. He oversaw the development of the system from his home in Shizuoka, Japan, where his dojo, the Yoseikan, was often visited by martial arts practitioners from all over the world. He died in Aix-en-Provence, France in 2003.    Image i - Mochizuki c. 1930     Relevant: Yoseikan Karate | Aikido | Yoseikan Aikido | Yoseikan Budo   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

judo,3b54hf,Carlos13th,4,Fri Jun 26 01:24:06 2015 UTC,"I do no-gi BJJ and we start from standing. I have very little wrestling experience so my takedown game is 95% judo. The grips definitely make things different, but as has been said elsewhere, an over/under can be used effectively in lieu of a traditional collar and sleeve grip; the underhook lifts the opponent upwards while the overhook works as a control. Because of the over/under grips, there's a lot less space available, so you have to keep your footwork tight and compact.   Harai goshi, o goshi, kouchi gari, ouchi gari, osoto gari, tai otoshi and tani otoshi have been money for me. I've gotten ippon seoi nage to work in no-gi before - in fact, it was the first throw I ever hit in a BJJ setting - but it's much tougher to hit than in gi."
judo,3b54hf,bear-knuckle,2,Fri Jun 26 06:47:07 2015 UTC,"I just started training at a sambo gym that does no-gi, and the standup game is similar to judo's. So far, I find that I go for the makkikomi grip far more often, as a result of the lack of grips. I've also found more success with a modified osoto gari. I usually enter like it's a ouchi gari, and then hook the outside of the leg instead of the inside. I'm also doing more seio otoshi. I guess all of these variations are because I can't grab a gi. Also lots of underhooks. I hope this helps."
judo,3b54hf,osotogary_,2,Fri Jun 26 02:45:50 2015 UTC,Thanks mate.  I am pretty new to judo myself so this is more of a curiosity and discussion question than anything else. So far what little judo I have used in No Gi has almost exclusively come from over hooking the arm.
judo,3b54hf,osotogary_,2,Fri Jun 26 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"Yea, that'll do it. I've also found that an underhook on your dominant side and an overhook on your non dominant can function pretty similar to a sleeve and collar in gi."

judo,3b2s1x,bozo78,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"Welp, I'm on a roll now, so let's go for the trifecta.   I think that judo has an incredibly rich system of physical development / maturation...and that most of us (me too) fail to use all of the tools at our disposal. You don't know what you don't know, IOW.  For example, how many people have you seen blast through uchikomis for speed? And yet, that is but one way of doing uchikomi, as the following clip by Koga attests  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JoPK7T1JVE  The long and short of it is pretty much that same as the old powerlifting saw: ""If you want to lift a lot .... you need to lift a lot"". In judo, if you want to throw a lot of people....you have to throw a lot of people.  No two ways around it. But...the methods are varied and bespoke. For one person, this could mean lots of nagekomi into crash mats. For another, Nage no kata can be a boon. A third might benefit from tumbling exercises and throwing dummy work.  As the famous Judoka Moshe Feldenkrais said ""if you know what you're doing, you can do what you want""."
judo,3b2s1x,bozo78,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"We do a couple of drills that might help.   We get into 3-man groups. Tori attempts to throw uke while the third guy braces him. This can be done by the third guy holding uke's belt and stopping uke from actually being thrown, or by reaching under uke's arms to grab both lapels so that tori basically has to throw both of them at the same time. We call 'em power uchikomi.  The other thing we do with a crash pad. Tori fits in for a throw, uke blocks (usually with their hips), and tori has to power through, change the angle, get lower, or whatever else might be necessary to finish the throw. Crash pad is a must here as you can generally expect a rough landing. This one really helped me the first time I did it, you kind of learn that a little resistance isn't the end of the throw (they're always going to resist!)"
judo,3b1u3w,SuperDuckMan,5,Thu Jun 25 07:53:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try and answer your question, but it's fairly complicated so bear with me. It has very little to nothing to do with your belt, but more with the following.   How long you have been working at it?  Time + Proper Training = Skills  What throws have you become good at? Certain throws are better suited to fighting large opponents. Being good at say, drop morote seio nage, will make it easier to throw larger opponents (although not very useful for small quick ones) Your personality  Aggression is key to defeating larger opponents. If they feel comfortable and unthreatened they will just sit back and use their triple whammy of weight, strength, and reach to defeat you. Your own body type. Explosive strength and cardiovascular are imperative. The less you have the longer it's gonna take for your skills to compensate. How many big guys you train with. If you don't fight big guys you won't learn how to beat them.   I know this isn't likely the answer you were looking for, but I hope it helps."
judo,3b1u3w,bushikris,3,Thu Jun 25 08:21:16 2015 UTC,"I like this answer, because the answer really is 'it depends' - I started Judo at about age 25, but at a bodyweight of 110ish kg, a deadlift of just shy of 700lbs (and a 150kg powerclean) and having played another contact sport at a professional level. Now it was a good dojo, with many people at national and international level, but the lighter weight fighters were having to work, even with me as a newbie white belt.   Sometimes people like to downplay size and strength (and aggressive temperament - the first time my wife saw me fight she said ""I scared her"", it counts for a lot) but they matter a huge deal. If you're on the small size, it takes a fair bit of skill to catch up with those attributes. But it does come with time. And at your age you should find maturation and skill developing rapidly together. Ah, to be young again!  On the flip side - you can't change your size, so it's not worth worrying about. You can work strength, but at lower skill levels you don't want to out-strength everybody particularly, as it slows skill development."

Mine has never been strong (and obviously wasn't when I was starting!) but I was manhandled in newaza - not so much osaekomiwaza, but strangles and armlocks all day long.

I can literally play with him and essentially throw him at will. I'm not saying this to brag by any means - guys older (mid twenties onward) my size and up are a massive pain to throw, even if they have less experience so I'm far from anything special. What I'm trying to say is that at your age don't worry at all about throwing bigger guys etc. Just focus on getting things right.

A small 13 year old, even a skilled one, is always going to have trouble with a big 13 year old never mind an adult.   Skill can certainly make a difference though.  We have one very skilled 13 year old in our dojo.  He is quite small and in local competitions he usually fights 2 weight classes up due to lack of opponents.   He still gets wins and usually places 2nd but he has to work for it against those bigger kids.  Recently at a bigger international competition where he could fight his own weight class, he won a division with 20 kids in it, no losses and I think almost every win by ippon."

judo,3b1ewg,void_public,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"For adults, it's a lot different than kids. From what I see, adults usually progress fairly quickly until brown belt, then stay there for a while, and if they're pretty dedicated, then they test for/are given their black belt. Kids are often held at each color belt for a while, 6 months to a year wouldn't be uncommon. However,  2.5 hours a week isn't a whole lot, unfortunately, so progress will be pretty slow. Don't get so obsessed with the belt color though, because at brown belt you can usually compete against black belts (in the USA at least)."

judo,3b0xjk,mikeysbike,6,Thu Jun 25 02:11:07 2015 UTC,Kuzushi is something you add to your opponents movement/momentum to break his posture and balance.  You can't go around tugging and pulling on static objects and expect them to move.  Relax your arms; stiff arms telegraph.
judo,3b0xjk,That_Stinky_Gi_Guy,2,Thu Jun 25 03:02:49 2015 UTC,"Action->reaction, that's what you should be working on. Kuzushi is not accomplished in a single pull or push, make uke react to your movement to prepare an attack, that realisation changed my game, now I don't completely suck at randori."
judo,3b0xjk,trupa,2,Thu Jun 25 05:24:25 2015 UTC,"You have to understand that the kuzushi you practice when doing static throws is not the same kuzushi you do when doing randori.  Try this:   Stand absolutely still, relaxed and in perfect balance.  Now close your eyes. Do this in slow motion, take a step forward.  Yes that is all. But did you feel it? Did you notice the absolutely first thing that happened?  In order for you to take a step forward you needed to do something.  What was it?  You had to lose your balance.  So, in order for you to take a step forward you first had to lose your balance.  Get it?  The ""kuzushi"" thing we often do in class is not the first step of kuzushi, but rather the second or third step.  First kuzushi happens, then Tori enhances it.  Tori can of course initiate it or make it happen.   Reading about it in books is ok, but the only way to understand it, is to feel it.  Practice, practice, practice…"
judo,3b0xjk,dzendian,2,Thu Jun 25 07:39:27 2015 UTC,"Work on causing reactions that are favorable to you.  If you want to throw them forward, give them a little shove backwards, then when they resist forwards, AT THE SAME TIME pull them forwards.  You're causing an auto-response/righting-reflex for them that is very hard to fight with the initial shove backwards.  An easy way to understand this concept is to (attempt to) master osoto gari, I think.  My Osoto Gari starts with a gentle tug toward me (which causes them to ""right""-reflex backwards), then I step in hard at the same time they are ""righting""-reflex to the back for chest-to-chest... and the rest is history."
judo,3b0xjk,Rockpyle,2,Thu Jun 25 08:37:01 2015 UTC,"I've only had one Judo instructor who was capable of teaching the feel of Judo in a way that an adult can understand but such lessons can really only happen in the dojo.  There are drills one can do to accelerate learning the feel of Judo but unless you practice this way you'll have to learn by trial and error.    I hate to sound all esoteric but think of it this way...what would happen if before you gripped up your training partner you sidestepped to the left and attempted to circle him.  He'd turn to face you which means you just made 280lbs move without putting a finger on him.  Why does that all of the sudden change when you both grip up.  Is it only because he's stronger?  Every time your opponent moves, even when he's gripped, is an opportunity to off balance and throw him.  The real issue here is your lack of experience and skill.  That's not meant to be an insult because even as a shodan I have these same issues.  I have these issues when the best way or direction to throw my opponent when he's off balance is left-sided.  Well, my left side is not nearly as good as my right as I am not ambidextrous.    tl;dr: Practice hard, attack often, and learn to love ukemi."
judo,3b0xjk,liftinheavythings,2,Thu Jun 25 14:17:53 2015 UTC,"Move people with your entire body, not just 'push' and 'pull'. For example, when I set up uchimata by pulling them down, I don't just pull them down with my arms, I bend at my waist and knees.   Move in circles. Judo is circular. Big people (normally) don't like to step, they want to set and throw - move them in circles, small kouchigari, deashibarai, throw ashiwaza at them constantly. These don't have to be fully committed throws, you just want them to step with you. Don't let them set!  Move Uke's head. Where the head moves, the body follows. Assuming you have a lapel grip, don't be afraid to 'gently' encourage their head with that hand - whether it's the back of the wrist (roll the hand into their jawline - google for 'Tenri wrist') or the heel of the hand. This is not a strike, and it's kind of hard to explain without showing, but it's a key part of competitive kuzushi."

And a lot of Judoka have bad Ukemi without realizing it.  This is not a reason to hate Kata.  I just trained last night with a guy I used to be in the same dojo with.  We competed in novice Nage-no-Kata in a tournament together previously, and worked on all five sets last night.  It was good.  But though we trained last night pretty well, it was originally a rocky start:  The first time we tried Nage-no-Kata together, he was in the habit of keeping a death grip on my Tsurite as he went over and I didn't have a great Uki-Otoshi execution either.  He jumped and gave me a flying knee right in my eye.  Laughter and Fight Club jokes from coworkers for an entire week after that.  But hey, now we do all five sets pretty smooth."

At the end, when tori kneels down and to the back, he does so at an angle to the side to make way for uke and pulls downwards with both hands towards his own hip.  If uke is not overly proficient at ukemi, he can do a sideway turn at the beginning, that's not how it should be demonstrated though.

judo,3azifx,dave_attenburz,7,Wed Jun 24 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"The Neil Adams demo is excellent. I help teach tai otoshi to the U of MN judo class for three years, and there are a few pointers I gave everyone that seemed to help a lot.     If uke is facing 12:00, your feet generally want to be at about 9:30 and 4:30, or thereabouts. Remember, the kuzushi for this throw is very much to uke's front corner. Pretend that you have a big hula-hoop taped to the calf of your dropping leg. That is where you should attempt to throw uke. Too many people treat tai-otoshi like a seoi-nage, and it's really quite different. Many times the throw locks up because, in trying to throw uke to your front, you try to throw them ""through"" your own body. Make a hole in the universe, and throw them into it, and they will rotate and land in front of you on their own. It's called body drop for a reason. The real kake and power from the throw is generated not by blocking the leg or even by the arms, but by the sudden dropping of tori's mass, redirected by pulling. A good tai-otoshi should end with you looking like you did a deep lunge (but keep your knees off the ground!) For tai-otoshi, the elbow of the lapel hand is much more powerful if it's kept from folding into the uke. I tell people to make a motion like they're throwing an American football overhand. In regards to stepping, I really like my sensei's philosophy: ""The first step of a throw is really just the last step of walking."" The best throws are the ones that sneak up on you, and often the giant, winding leg swings are easy to read once you've seen them a couple times. Think instead about really casually walking, and just doing an occasional tai-sabaki back step. Then, as uke starts to pick their next step up, you start to off balance them towards where they're about to step. If you synchronize the movement of your pushing hand with that of your attack leg, you should create very compelling kuzushi to the small toe of their advancing leg, enabling you to easily tip them over your calf.   Sorry for the advice vomit, hopefully some of this is helpful!"
judo,3azifx,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:07:48 2015 UTC,You think about tai otoshi like I think about tai otoshi. That saves me a lot of typing and also gives me warm fuzzies.
judo,3azifx,pk618,2,Sat Jun 27 15:55:29 2015 UTC,Tai otoshi is the single most difficult common competitive throw in judo. Don't feel so bad.  It's also really flexible. Where you step depends on a lot of factors. But a common problem is stepping too close. You actually want distance.
judo,3azifx,ReddJudicata,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:58:50 2015 UTC,"This will be difficult to put into words, but I can try. I can honestly say that I did not understand tai-otoshi until I was demonstrated a principle in Italy last year by Corrado sensei. It really opened my eyes to a new aspect of unbalancing in tai-otoshi. Imagine standing face to face with uke in a regular right-vs-right stance. Place your left leg up close to your right leg which is to the left of uke (tsugi-ashi) meanwhile using tsurikomi-grip (you are now basically standing two feet close together on a tight location on top of your center of gravity). You now place your right leg to the outside of uke's right leg using a wide step, by doing so you shift your center of gravity to between your legs (that is now above shoulder-width apart) and that energy is transferred onto uke by holding your arms in the tsurikomi-grip and pulling him with you but not on top of your back, push him sideways. The effect is that uke is pulled completely onto his right leg and his posture is destroyed (kuzushi). I need to grow some balls and upload a video of it, it's awesome."
judo,3azifx,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:48:28 2015 UTC,"I keep thinking about this advice:   ""Place your left leg up close to your right leg which is to the left of uke (tsugi-ashi) meanwhile using tsurikomi-grip (you are now basically standing two feet close together on a tight location on top of your center of gravity).""   What do you mean ""your right leg is to the left of Uke?""  Do you mean that if we're facing each other and you're Uke, I'm not directly in front of you but rather off to your right (my left) side?  I don't get this.  This would be starting tai Otoshi way over on the OTHER side, as opposed to ""right foot to the top of the triangle between Uke's feet"" or ""start to Uke's left.""    Can you explain once more where my first (right footed) step would begin?  And then- for good measure- where my left should go?  Sorry for the confusion btw."
judo,3azifx,Ryvai,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, while facing uke you move slightly to your right, also pulling uke slightly towards his left, this will create an reaction. Uke will want to shift his weight towards his right, to compensate for the previous movement. The door is now wide open to pull uke off-balance towards his right. It's a special move which is hard to explain, but I've tried. It would be easier to upload a video to be honest, but I'm traveling atm :)"
judo,3azifx,fastr1337,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you- I think I get it a bit better now.  So your advice is to start Tai O to Uke's left- to begin the throw by stepping my right foot OUTSIDE of Uke's left foot, which is NOT AT ALL the same thing as starting the throw by stepping to the apex of the triangle (in which case I would be starting the throw in the MIDDLE of Uke).  This changes the throw- this is a completely different stepping pattern.  I will try it.  I always imagined it as ""step with the right foot into the middle of Uke and then space my right and left legs equally, across and in front of Uke.  Instead, this is: start to his left and from there- from that point (slightly left of him) blast across with your right leg as you pull him over.  The stepping pattern really does change the feeling of the throw-- when I step to the ""middle of the triangle"" I almost feel like I'm pulling in (Kuzushi) and then pushing out (Kake).  When I step to Uke's left side I feel like the throw is more of a constant flowing motion, rather than two separate parts.  I hope I'm making sense.  Oh and btw- I LOVE the advice about off balancing Uke by taking him with you during Kuzushi- it's a great image.  Lastly- what do you make of the advice I've been given to ""make like I'm throwing an American football"" with my right (Tsurite) hand?  Wow is that different from what I'd been doing-- which was to basically try and punch Uke in the face with my right hand (i.e., a constant push), which never worked.  What this overhand-US football-throwing action does is turn me more and create a push-then-pull scenario- which (again) is a different animal altogether.  I would ALWAYS get stuck with my damn Tsurite hand- ALWAYS!!!  Now at least I've got a different feeling/movement/motion to aim for...  Guys- thank you so much for the advice- and please, keep it coming!"
judo,3azifx,dzendian,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"ok. so this is how I get my pee wee class to do it, and they get it pretty good.    step with you right leg so you make an equilateral triangle with your partners two legs. take your left leg and turn so that you and your partner are facing the same way, making another equilateral triangle, this time with your two legs, and your partners left leg. take your right leg and shoot it across your partners body. place it right outside their right foot, so that your ankle is on their ankle. make sure your shin is parallel to the mat. as you are stepping across, lift your left arm, like you are looking at your wrist watch, and push straight up with your right. Finally, pull forward and extend your leg at the same time. and youve got it.   Good luck!"
judo,3ayudu,Suey13,2,Wed Jun 24 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"I don't follow what this means, or what it's being changed from."
judo,3ayudu,AlmostFamous502,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"Golden Score is sudden death overtime, so my guess would be that prior to the rule change, the match would end as soon as someone got 10 seconds worth of pin resulting in a yuko win. Now the ref will allow it to continue until ippon or whatever, so that people can win with a higher score, even in sudden death overtime.   Just a guess though."
judo,3ayudu,Brisbanebodega,2,Wed Jun 24 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"Correct,  there is currently a question we are hoping to have clarified tomorrow regarding if 10+ seconds have elapsed in a pin and uke submits tori utilizing shime or kansetsu. Would uke then win the match even though tori has scored?  Stay tuned..."

judo,3ayudu,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:13:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Some contestants watch the clock to see when they reach a yoko and let go of their grip, thinking they have automatically won.  They forget that it is the ref that decides who win :)"

More realistically your body will react in the way you have trained it through 1000s of repitions, either way they wont be good at ukemi and will be in pain"

judo,3axxvq,gentlemanofleisure,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Why should you? You just keep it simple and do the exact same thing you've done hundreds or thousands of times: throwing a resisting opponent on his back with force, speed and control."
judo,3axxvq,gentlemanofleisure,-2,Wed Jun 24 21:46:33 2015 UTC,"Lots of force, lots of speed, a lot less control. You want to hurt or kill an attacker."
judo,3axxvq,smegma_toast,3,Wed Jun 24 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"You really don't.  An attacker is a human being.  They may have had too much to drink, they may be in a bad situation and desperate for money.  Either way, if you end up killing or hurting someone, you will have to deal with the consequences.  One of the main reasons I began learning Judo was because it's way more likely for me to be able to control an aggressive situation without hurting anyone.  I think it's way more powerful to win a fight without injuring the other person."
judo,3axxvq,Bluurgh,-1,Wed Jun 24 23:27:35 2015 UTC,"So no killing. However if someone comes at me, I still have full intent to break them."

What is best?  To hurt him and end up damaging your relationship with all of the other people who are there?  Or to control the situation like a boss, sit his ass gently onto the ground and sit on him for a minute while you tell him to settle down?  The next day, your friend thanks you for not making it awkward between him and his new wife.  His family were impressed that you showed such self control.  The fact is, most fights are not some stranger attacking you.  Most fights are some drunk acting like a jerk and it's very likely you will know the person at least a little bit.  Even if the person is a stranger, they are still a human being.  Why hurt someone if you have the option not to?"

judo,3axxvq,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:02:34 2015 UTC,"A good example might be ouchi gari.  If you have control of uke , it's possible to just sit him down gently.  People who don't grapple are really bad at avoiding throws so it's pretty easy to off balance them and just lower them to the ground."

judo,3axxvq,SVPPB,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"First off, a well executed vanilla judo throw on the pavement will end the fight instantly. There are plenty of examples in youtube if you feel like looking.  There's no need to attempt unusual ""lethal"" variations that you can't practice in randori. Just ask a black belt at your club to throw you with osoto gari, for instance. Even on tatami it takes all the fight out of you.  Secondly, ""Control"" doesn't refer to softening your opponent's fall. It means you are supposed to retain control over him after the throw. That's why newaza exists. If the throw isn't enough, judo provides you with the tools to finish the fight on the ground."
judo,3axxvq,SVPPB,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:35:41 2015 UTC,I'll look into BJJ to improve my newaza
judo,3axxvq,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Thu Jun 25 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"BJJ is always a great addition.  But keep in mind that judo should teach you more than enough newaza for self defense purposes. BJJ 'ers are ground fighting specialists, but good judokas are no slouches either."
judo,3axxvq,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:49:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input!
judo,3axxvq,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Thu Jun 25 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't spike an aggressor either way. The risk vs. consequence of it failing is too high. If your plan fails and you drop forward and they take your back they can do whatever they like to the back of your head and you might be dead. What you want is 'control', and I emphasize again; subdue your opponent by 'control'. Most people don't even know how to fall like we do in martial arts and they hit their head on the pavement either way, but at least they are on their back with you on top to do whatever is necessary given the situation, be it run away or incapacitate the aggressor. The nage-waza of old jujitsu, which Judo is based upon, had the goal of throwing the opponent in close-quarters to the ground and finish him off with a short-blade through weaknesses in his armor. Put a person who is clueless of grappling on his back and you will see all sorts of opportunities to hurt him. Killing him by spiking his head is not a good idea, in my opinion."
judo,3axxvq,Plutoid,3,Wed Jun 24 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Many front throws in general are a bit risky for self defense applications, simply because you're exposing your back and opening up to have your knees kicked out or get choked. If you're really interested in judo self defense, I strongly recommend you check out the goshin-jutsu-no-kata, which was developed by the Kodokan in the 50's.   Kodokan Demonstration"

judo,3axxvq,Plutoid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"Remember that what we consider holds in judo are merely superior positions that grant you control over your opponent's body.   In a real fight, you might pin a person until he comes to his senses or the cops arrive... Or you might use your advantageous position to beat him to a pulp.  What I'm trying to say is that holds give you a win in judo because having such control over the other guy would probably win a fight. Just look up any MMA fight where one fighter achieves the mount and wins by ground and pound. Or even better, look up rousey vs. Davis for a perfect example of judo with punches."
judo,3axxvq,Plutoid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"That is interesting. While we are on the subject of hold downs, what are the pros and cons of kesa gatame vs kuzure kesa gatame?"
judo,3axxvq,Plutoid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"Kesa gatame is the go-to hold down. It's easy to achieve and very secure.  Kuzure kesa is a good option if you don't manage to get your right arm into a full kesa. Con: It's a bit less secure.  Pros: a) you can place all your weight on his chest and crush him. And b) it's more mobile than the standard kesa. It's easier to work for a submission, or to turn into yoko shio gatame, or into side control for an ude garami."

judo,3axxvq,pk618,2,Thu Jun 25 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I tested the movement with a dummy on mats ... let me say I don't want to see what this would do to a human on a hard surface. Death or at least grave injury via shattered skull or broken neck would be very likely.  Of course it is difficult to apply a throw versus a fully resisting attacker. If he has no grappling experience whatsoever, your chances to successfully throw him are not bad if you practiced it a lot.  Also note, that we enter Seoi Nage from between uke's arms nowadays. The koryu bugai judo stems from, had tori often enter from outside the arms, meaning the arms were locked or at least had difficulties to hold onto tori during the throw.  The biggest problem for a judoka is usually covering the distance between himself and the opponent without being effectively punched or kicked. Unless you practice that somehow, you'll have a problem if your opponent is an at least a tiny bit trained striker.  A throw that fails may expose your back. That's why one should grip uke's arm as in the Nage no Kata to prevent at least being choked if Ippon Seoi Nage fails."
judo,3axxvq,da_choppa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:35:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for testing it for me. I hope the dummy wasn't hurt too bad...  Also thanks for the insight, I'll have to look into the Nage no Kata soon."
judo,3axxvq,ItsJonesey94,2,Wed Jun 24 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"I tested that years ago... ;)  Anyway, in the koryu bugai it was actually common to make the fall as devastating for the opponent as possible (throwing on the head, neck, shoulder or in ways that would break an arm or the back). Throws were supposed to end fights (often once and for all). Most Judo throws can easily be modified somewhat and become really, really nasty.  As I stated in an article here a while back, Kano did not remove the dangerous techniques from jujutsu to create Judo, he merely provided safe methods to train them at full force."
judo,3axxvq,ItsJonesey94,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:38:57 2015 UTC,How about uki goshi? It seems like quite a small throw to me.
judo,3axxvq,ItsJonesey94,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"I am not sure if the aim can be modified on that one, but know, that -if executed correctly- Uki Goshi can be a very hard throw.  The idea is (in the right sided form) to place uke's weight on his advanced right foot as if he hovers on it (the Japanese verb uku means hovering among other things), then diagonally ripping him away and down around one's hip while locking uke's upper body tightly to your own. If done properly both his feet lose contact to the floor and the throw is sharp and quick. If it's done that way, you want to know ukemi and have a mat below you. Otherwise you are in a world of pain."
judo,3axxvq,bozo78,0,Thu Jun 25 06:35:02 2015 UTC,Uki goshi always looked like a crappy o goshi to me. I'll ask my sensei about that variant.
judo,3axxvq,bozo78,2,Thu Jun 25 07:50:36 2015 UTC,"My old jujitsu instructor made a point to show all of the throws in the system the ""nice way"" and the ""mean way"".  One is how you do it in the gym, the other is how you try to injure someone trying to injure you without care for their well-being.  Like O Soto Gari, for instance.  In a fight, you follow you straight backward and onto the ground and focus the impact on the back of their head instead of holding their sleeve and letting them rotate a bit.  Judo as a system is based on taking the ""mean"" throw and turning it into the ""nice"" version so that you can practice the technique with full force."

judo,3axnpg,SuperDuckMan,7,Wed Jun 24 09:26:00 2015 UTC,"This is wrong, they are separate throws and your sensei is correct. Ippon-seoi-nage and seoi-nage are two different throws, with separate terminology. In Kodokan Judo there are officially 67 nage-waza (throwing techniques). The gokyo is only a pedagogic tool to help learning, based on incremental challenges/difficulty for uke (mostly ukemi). It only contains 40 throws, based of 5 series, but not all of the 67. For a complete list of waza, you can look at this list.  Previously, before 1997, there only existed 'seoi-nage', which covered all variations, including eri-seoi-nage, morote-seoi-nage and so on, 'ippon-seoi-nage' being one of them. But in 1997 two waza were separated and given distinct names; sode-tsurikomi-goshi were separated from tsurikomi-goshi as its own technique because of it's specific use of the hiki-te (sleeve) and ippon-seoi-nage for it's distinct arm usage.   'Ippon-seoi-nage' is where you latch on to uke's (one) arm, using both your hands, one being under his armpit. 'Seoi-nage' covers the variations, including; morote-seoi-nage, eri-seoi-nage, and so on.   For variations on seoi-nage you can look at this kodokan video. Note that in the beginning of this clip it says '65 techniques', this is because the video was created before 1997 and the term 'ippon-seoi-nage' and 'sode-tsurikomi-goshi' was not yet included as separate throws. The gokyo was created before 1997, this is why you only see either 'seoi-nage' or 'ippon-seoi-nage' on the grading syllabus, as it's uncommon to mess with the typical 8x5 standard. Some clubs specify that you can choose which one you want to show.  Hope that answers your questions :)"

judo,3axnpg,Aratoast,3,Wed Jun 24 21:29:44 2015 UTC,"Essentially, yes they're the same throw in that they're both seoinage, and ""morote"" or ""ippon"" efers to the grip being used. But because they're using different grips they become effectively different throws, or at least variant enough to be taught as two seperate techniques."

judo,3axnpg,flowgod,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:20:45 2015 UTC,"The two I like to use for performing ipon seoinsge: instead of gripping the sleeve of the side I'm attacking I grip the lapel. Far side arm still goes under the armpit, but the pulling arm grips the lapel. Similarly, I also like to perform the throw with both hands gripping the lapel on the attacking side. I hope that makes sense."

'Eri' means collar, 'morote' is based on two words 'moro' (two/double) and 'te' (hand), so double-handed."

judo,3axnpg,Rockpyle,2,Wed Jun 24 23:00:50 2015 UTC,I consider them to be different throws because I perform them differently.  It's not just the grip.  It's how the hands are used that needs to be considered as well.  My squat is also lower/deeper with morote seoi nage to prevent elbow and wrist issues.

judo,3ax68i,luminosity11,3,Wed Jun 24 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"Do NOT train Judo and avoid physical contact (of the area effected) with anyone, it's extremely easily transmitted to others. You'll risk putting the entire dojo out of commission if you do.  Ringworm is a skin fungus, and basically looks like this, it can start out as a red soar area, but you will quickly realize that a ring is forming that can expand somewhat and iches. Luckily I've only had it once when I was doing wrestling. Go to a doctor at get treatment for it. You'll usually get rid of it a few weeks time, but should avoid close contact (training) for at least one or two weeks after it is 'gone', to make sure. So, you've got confirmed ringworm by your doctor, what do you do? First, make sure you get the right treatment to get rid of it. Contact your sensei or those responsible of the dojo immediately and inform them that you have a case of ringworm and the dojo is at risk. Basically the entire dojo should be cleaned, top to bottom (anywhere people come on contact with the surroundings), all the mats MUST be disinfected, and all clothes 'hanging around' must be washed thoroughly. Ringworm is not dangerous, but it is critical for a competitor, as he is not allowed to compete if ringworm is discovered. Strict procedures should be in place in any dojo in any case of ringworm (fungus infections). Wash all your gi's or training clothes thoroughly and clean your house. This shit spreads easily."
judo,3ax68i,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yes you skip class.   If you think you have it speak to your doctor.   After training wash with Anti Dandruff Shampoo preferably the moment you get home, this is even more important during the summer. It helps get rid of Fungus."
judo,3ax68i,Carlos13th,3,Fri Jun 26 04:21:17 2015 UTC,Kids competition: which throws are effective against opponent stiff arming?
judo,3ax68i,studiorex,5,Wed Jun 24 06:57:35 2015 UTC,"My ever growing list of tips regarding stiff arming:   [General tip, not for competition] The diplomatic solution: Talk to your partner. None of you will get any better if he continues. You can pull yourself into a back grip step by step, by moving your grip further and further around their back, which increases the pressure on their stiff arm until it folds. Just walk backwards. He has to bent his arm to pull you back or step forward follow you. Either way, you may be able to exploit this (via Ko Uchi Gari, Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi or Hiza Guruma perhaps, maybe even Uki Otoshi). Push against the stiff arms from below against the elbow(s). This often makes the opponent bend it/them or taking off his grip. You can follow up with O Soto Gari (if be suddenly bents his elbow as a response to the pressure, immediatly pull it down to your own hips and turn about 45° for the attack) or Sode-tsuri-komi-goshi if he lets go of his grip, push his harm diagnoally across and enter with your hips. Some throws may even work at stiff arm distance, depending on the length of your and his limbs. Hiza guruma for example. Try to attack from different angles. Stiff arms are the strongest against a frontal attack. Try to attack diagonally or from 45° or even 90° angles.  [Not for kids competition!] Sometimes armlocks can be applied. Certain armlocks/methods of applying them can be dangerous. Use them with care, if at all. For a right sided ippon-seoi-nage grip, there's this: grab the sleeve of uke's right arm at the elbow, but not at the outer side. Instead put your hand further under it until you can grab the cloth at the inside. Then pull it tightly outwards. This may bend his elbow. At the same time move your right hand over his left arm and then ""dive"" with your entire right arm and shoulder under his right arm. This has to be done with your entire body of course. It is helpful to initiate it with pushes into the opposite direction(s) first (like pushing his elbow down and inside first).   This article was recommended in past threads:  http://thedifficultway.blogspot.ca/2011/02/dealing-with-stiffy.html  As this article states: There is no silver bullet!"
judo,3ax68i,pk618,2,Wed Jun 24 07:08:52 2015 UTC,"All of this. In fact you said everything I usually say. I'd add tai otoshi to the ""just walk backwards"" throws too."
judo,3ax68i,Brisbanebodega,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:14:40 2015 UTC,"Is it legal to give a quick chop or blow to the inside of your partner's arm? Not the elbow side so there's no danger to the joint, but basically just pushing it in the direction it's supposed to bend?"
judo,3ax68i,Brisbanebodega,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Just striking is not competition legal. If you grab the jacket first and then do a striking movement or something similar with that hand that holds his jacket,... that's something different... may be allowed, but not very nice."
judo,3ax68i,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, there's also that one-sided taiotoshi where you have one hand on the end of the sleeve and whip your forearm into the crook of the elbow on the same side! Sort of the same idea."
judo,3ax68i,Carlos13th,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's no strike, you place your hand (or better forearm) in the crook of the elbow, then push."
judo,3ax68i,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:19:08 2015 UTC,For kids shiai I see simple things like hiza-guruma working well. Just ask them to walk in a circle and place their leg to the opponents knee. Uke will probably just trip over it for a score :)
judo,3ax68i,Carlos13th,2,Wed Jun 24 07:26:21 2015 UTC,I want to get a better idea of what the rules are for when I start to look to enter comps especially in reugards to thinks like what locks and grips are allowed (which wont be for some time) whats the best resource for this? A video that explains the rules with visual examples would be ideal if an accurate one exists.
judo,3ax68i,pk618,2,Wed Jun 24 07:35:33 2015 UTC,"The easiest would be to ask your sensei, that is if he is updated on the 2014-2016 IJF-rules, and ask him to teach you. Otherwise Neil Adams and Ezio Gamba has made a video demonstrating some of the rules. If you'd like specifics there is a pdf link on top of the /r/judo page that contains almost everything you need. Pick the out the ones you don't understand and ask your sensei or post it here. I'd gladly help you understand them."
judo,3ax68i,kitcheo,2,Wed Jun 24 08:05:24 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. Yeah my instructor does help with rules when I break them but explaining every little rule to me in one sitting would take a great deal of time. Will check your links and ask both you and my instructor for any clarifications required.
judo,3ax68i,pk618,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:20:06 2015 UTC,It's also great to go watch a tournament with someone who knows the rules and can clarify what's going on. Especially if you have someone in your club who is an official.
judo,3ax68i,kitcheo,2,Wed Jun 24 12:10:37 2015 UTC,"I've been focusing on Osoto Gari in class and I'm getting better at it. However, at times I accidently swing my heel into Uke's outside heel which is not fun at all. How can I prevent that from happening?"
judo,3ax68i,silvaphysh13,3,Wed Jun 24 12:05:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say bend your reaping leg and point the toe like there is a match on the tip of your big toe that you're trying to strike on the mat. Also, how much up-swing do you have on your reap? I much prefer a quick, crescent shaped wrap of the leg and using the body and hips to power the reap back rather than an old style can-can dancer kick and reap.   Let me know if this helps at all. Really you shouldn't be reaping heel first so that is probably part of the problem."
judo,3ax68i,kitcheo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:14:56 2015 UTC,"My leg is straight and stretched out, swinging it up until it's parallel to the ground. I swing down and strike Uke's calf with my calf, like what you said (kick and reap). Maybe it's harder to control and aim my reap properly this way?   I'll definitely try a quicker, bent leg reap next time though. It sounds more precise. And you're right, I also think I don't point my toes all the time because I'm focusing on every other part of the technique. I'll make these adjustments and see how it feels. Thanks for the pointers!"
judo,3ax68i,pk618,2,Wed Jun 24 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"I would also say that you're perhaps too far away from uke. Ideally, you want to make thigh-to-thigh contact for optimal power. Make sure when you do this not to leave your arm behind, though, or you lose a lot of good kuzushi."
judo,3ax68i,kitcheo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"I will keep that in mind, thanks for the tip. There is definitely a lot of little things to think about!"
judo,3ax68i,pk618,2,Wed Jun 24 22:57:15 2015 UTC,"You bet! It might seem like the opposite, but a slightly bent leg with a pointed toe is actually stronger than a locked straight leg. Good luck, o soto is a devastating throw if you get good with it."
judo,3ax68i,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:00:53 2015 UTC,I had training today and the bent leg reap feels so so so much better. I'm starting to feel this throw!
judo,3ax68i,kitcheo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:33:56 2015 UTC,"Excellent! Glad to hear it, O soto is a throw that seems simple but gets complex very quickly when you have to do it against resistance lol."
judo,3ax68i,kitcheo,2,Mon Jun 29 11:37:19 2015 UTC,"What you are probably missing is the kuzushi necessary to do it. His weight need to be on that leg so that he cannot move out of the way. You do this by pulling him slightly sideways and down, anchoring his weight onto the leg."
judo,3ax68i,kitcheo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:41:46 2015 UTC,I think that might be it. My kuzushi is probably a bit off. I pull myself tight to his body and off-balance him back and down. I might have neglected the sideways pull on the sleeve. Thanks for the reminder!
judo,3ax68i,jonoy52,2,Wed Jun 24 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"Go slower in practice and refine your stance and take a close look at the distance and angle between you and your partner. Correct them if necessary and practice it that way. Ask your instructor for corrections.  Also don't ax your partners leg with the heel. In fact the toes of your reaping foot should be pointed forward/downward during the movement, while you aim to hit your partners leg with the lower back of your upper tigh against his. O Soto Gari is actually a higher (as in altitude) throw than many beginners assume. The contact point of your legs shouldn't be lower than the back of your knee.  For some O Soto Gari examples, look in my video list here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/2qh230/go_kyu_no_waza_first_set_video_list_the_good_the/"
judo,3ax68i,lazyhaze22,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:13:42 2015 UTC,"Good idea, I will definitely do it more step-by-step next time. I usually ask my training partners for pointers but yes, I think sensei will pick up more mistakes.  I've been reaping calf to calf all this time. I'm guessing that you get less throwing power that way? I'll aim to reap with the thigh next time. Thanks for the link, that is an impressive collection of videos! Great resource, definitely bookmarked."
judo,3ax68i,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"After I wrote that, I went to training yesterday and among other things I went over O Soto Gari variants with my instructor.

judo,3ax68i,Ryvai,2,Thu Jun 25 05:55:37 2015 UTC,"Hi All. I have been doing judo for about 4 months, 2 nights a week. I have not been around my club to see a promotion yet. I do not have any expectations for when I will earn my yellow belt. I just wondered what I should be expected to know. I asked to see the syllabus for my dojo, but they didn't have any printed out when i asked.  From my research of different club standards, this is what i think i should focus on:  Break Falls - Front, back, rolling, left and right, Osoto Gari, Ogoshi, Hiza Garuma, De Ashi Hari, Kesa Gatame, Kata Gatame, Judo terminology, history and etiquette  Does this seem like a good standard to work toward? Should I focus on any other techniques? I understand that judo is a lifelong learning process and I should strive to be knowledgeable of as many techniques as possible. That being said, right now i want to focus and review what i will need to know to earn my yellow belt."
judo,3ax68i,user079,3,Wed Jun 24 12:45:37 2015 UTC,"In Norway this is the requirement for yellow belt (and a good syllabus in my opinion);   Understand the meaning of some words; matte, hajime, rei, shizen-tai, jigo-tai, randori, kumi-kata, kuzushi. Ushiro-ukemi (backwards breakfall, without roll) Yoko-ukemi (sideways breakfall)  Mae-mawari-ukemi (forwards breakfall, with roll, without standing up) Osaekomi-waza; kesa-gatame, kata-gatame, yoko-shiho-gatame, tate-shiho-gatame, kami-shiho-gatame 1 kansetsu-waza of your choice (based on syllabus selection) 1 shime-waza of your choice (based on syllabus selection) Dai-ikkyo (first set of the gokyo); de-ashi-barai, hiza-guruma, sasae-tsurikomi-goshi, uki-goshi, o-soto-gari, o-goshi, o-uchi-gari, seoi-nage/ippon-seoi-nage.

judo,3ax68i,lazyhaze22,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Really? I'm not a big fun of that syllabus.  You only have to learn one kanzetsu waza and one shime waza of your choice, but you need to know the entire first group of the Gokyo?  I think that's disproportionate.  Also, the gokyo doesn't seem to make much sense as a modern teaching tool. Hiza guruma, sasae and deashi are subtle techniques, I don't think many yellow belts can really pull them off."
judo,3ax68i,luminosity11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:08:18 2015 UTC,"Jigoro Kano clearly stated that tachi-waza was most important, and that it should be developed before ne-waza. The focus should be 70% tachi-waza and 30% ne-waza. The first set of the gokyo is 8 techniques. They have to learn 5 osaekomiwaza, 1 kansetsu-waza and 1 shime-waza,  that's 7 techniques in ne-waza. About a 50/50 focus. For yellow belts it's more important to learn osaekomi-waza. They need to learn how to control someone before they start submitting them, in my opinion.   I think, to teach the difference between sasae-tsurikomi-ashi and hiza-guruma to youngsters you need to 'really' understand them yourself. Most people just say, in sasae place it on their ankle, on hiza put it on the knee, and so on. Which is not what it's all about. De-ashi-barai is very easy to understand, and a simple concept to explain. The biggest challenge is the timing. It's good for them to start practicing it early :)"

judo,3ax68i,dave_attenburz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"""ninja-turtles"" style probably refers to 'buddy-taping', as they appear to have less fingers. Which means that if your pinky-finger is injured, you tape it together with your ring-finger for support, like 'buddying' them together. Additionally it is recommended to individually tape the ligaments that are injured using X-sections. There's tons of videos on finger-taping on YouTube :)"

judo,3ax68i,stripelesswb,2,Wed Jun 24 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what you mean. Holding both sleeves instead of sleeve and lapel? If so, holding no lapel contradicts the idea of tsuri komi, meaning you somehow have to reel in uke like a fish with a fishing pole. For that you need a lapel or at least a high collar grip.  Other than that, a variant is just another tool in your box. It comes handy when the situation it suits best arises."
judo,3ax68i,Carlos13th,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:01:46 2015 UTC,I think he means pushing sleeve upwards/pulling lapel vs. the other way round.  Either way works. IMO the sleeve version is easier.

So when we do newaza in class, I tend to go in to my ""rolling mode"" which could be considered ""too much""? The question, should I slow down, or should I not?  Example: we start back-to-back, we turn around, and as soon as I go for lapel grips, they tend to turtle. After that I take their back and just do a RNC. Happened more than once, and it was quick too. I kinda feel bad about it (I don't do it to kids, only adults).  Thanks."
judo,3ax68i,Tviburi,2,Wed Jun 24 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Hadaka Jime is the name. It is introduced in sankyu, it is trivial and therefore not easy to pull it off"
judo,3ax68i,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"It's actually not that hard to pull off on someone who doesn't know too many back mount escapes. My favorite setup is to grab their face near the opposite side of the jaw, turn the face towards that side while sliding another arm in position and not releasing their sideway face. Works like a charm against judokas (including some black belts).  I also did the ""finger under nose"" and pull up to open up the neck. But that's a bit harsh and I usually don't run that setup."
judo,3ax68i,Tviburi,2,Wed Jun 24 22:03:04 2015 UTC,"It's not a violation of etiquette imho. You just make the best use of the given situation under the given rules. How intense one should roll, depends on the partner and how you and he want to go. It can be totally playful or competition like.  Unfortunately many judoka I roll with tend to turtle or just lie face down on their stomach once they are threatened to be put in a hold or pin, because due to the current competition rules it is not the worst tactic (let the opponent waste his strength and wait until the referee pauses the fight to let it continue from a standing position).  Most also tend to roll at full intensity, not knowing, that a playful randori has it's benefits from time to time.  Anyway, if you feel uncomfortable with how it goes, ask your partners. If you want the randori to go a different way, try something new. Pull guard, or give them side control at the beginning, turtle yourself and see how you can get out of it. There's no winning or losing, just learning and experimenting."
judo,3ax68i,JudokaYasha,2,Wed Jun 24 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the perspective. Yeah, I went to practice a few times, and that's the biggest thing I noticed to date, you guys turtle like there's no tomorrow. And in BJJ turtle isn't that good of a position, there lots of submissions from there (clock choke, anakonda, a variation of bow and arrow, and many many others I don't know about), not to mention your back is exposed."
judo,3ax68i,Tviburi,2,Wed Jun 24 21:59:54 2015 UTC,Yeah the difference is in BJJ you get all the time in the world to work from someones back. In Judo you only have to surive until the ref stands you up. That's why turtling is far more useful in Judo.
judo,3ax68i,Tviburi,2,Wed Jun 24 22:24:20 2015 UTC,"If you can pull off some shime-waza, that is great. But bad etiquette is using your strength or weight to your advantage if you outweighing your opponent by 70 pounds. Make sure that you give your opponent a slight chance of doing something. If you are holding back you at least know that you could have made it. Usually when I roll with inferior opponents I get in place to perform the choke or armbar but release it way before they tap just to demonstrate that I could have had it, I then let them escape (if they use a realistic escape method), then continue from there, no need to reset. When your opponent is way better than you, your goal should be to survive and not get caught. Submitting him/her is optimistic, albeit being the ultimate goal. Try to put yourself in your opponents place, if he is learning something, then good! but if you are just pummeling your opponent, and they have no clue what happened, make sure they learn. Jita-kyoei :)"
judo,3ax68i,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:20:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks. You just voiced what we usually do in BJJ while rolling (although I usually start giving slack to people who weigh below the 30-40 lbs gap, since I myself am only 165lbs).  I do have to disagree on not finishing it since I'm only a blue belt and one year in. If I decide before the roll that I will go for submissions, then I will finish them, but without excessive use of the strength or 'dirty tricks' like blocking their breathing or pressing on the face (totally legal in BJJ).  Mutual benefit is a great concept, but in BJJ we sort of think that if you are submitting someone -- you are teaching them, in a way. They know more after you do it."
judo,3ax68i,Tviburi,2,Wed Jun 24 23:37:53 2015 UTC,"Brown belt here, still a noob question. When I get thrown I have a tendency to grab tight on my opponents gi and fall on my butt. From there I try to bait my opponent into my guard, I do this instead of turning and turtling.  I prefer playing guard and fighting my opponent on the ground. I was wondering if this method of too risky or not good judo?"
judo,3ax68i,JudokaYasha,2,Thu Jun 25 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"Depends I think.  Do you let yourself being thrown to pull that ""trick""? If yes, bad Judo imho.  Do you do that only when you can't avoid being thrown? Again: Depends. Usually proper ukemi (especially in practice) helps you avoid injury. Clinging to your partner can also backfire and make him fall onto you in a way that hurts you. On the other hand it sounds like a good idea to have a gameplan for this situation (being thrown) to continue fighting effectively.  In shiai falling on your butt instead of turning out puts you at the mercy of the referees who might see a bigger score in it than it should be."

judo,3awf55,NastyWatermellon,4,Wed Jun 24 07:11:09 2015 UTC,"It's unfair to compare individuals against eachother that way in my opinion. People have vastly difference skill levels and handles stress (randori/shiai) in different ways. Some are extremely technical, but lack the mind of a fighter, these individuals often prefer kata or becoming a referee for example, which is fine. But then again some are fighters and shine under pressure, like yellow belts beating blue belts in randori. I think there's room for diversity in Judo, and I dislike the idea of 'survival of the fittest' mentality, which is not jita-kyoei :p"

I was a national-level competitor out of the north east from 2008 to 2010. Fighting one of Jason's guy was the absolute worst. Why? Because you were fighting the guy, fighting Jason and then fighting the ref.  I played twice a week with every top level east cost guy who wasn't in Boston with Jimmy or at Jason's place, at NYAC. NONE of them ever had a single good thing to say about a time training with him.  The guy was completely out of control. When you fought one oh his guys, he would stand on the side of the mat and scream the entire match, that you were passive, that you grabbed the legs. ANYTHING he could do to make his guy look more active and bully the ref. The sad part is it worked. He'd literally use his influence to berate and scream at the refs, and I'm sure you all know how are it is to get expirience refs, they're not all like Sense Williams out of Oishi Judo in NYC.  Half the time the opponent wouldn't even have the benefit of having a couch in their corner (like I didnt ) and this guy would still be going 110% like it was the world's. He was embarassing to watch. I saw this at the new York open, liberty bell, Morristown open, at Rutgers, at west point and the can-am games."

""Thanks, coach, never occurred to me.""  Kendo is way more strict on all manner of etiquette.  You can have a point cancelled for showing any sort of celebration (like a little fist pump). Cheering your team mates is discouraged, although clapping is fine.    No protest on anything is possible for the player - arguing with the ref will get you a penalty or DQ.  The coach can raise a flag to initiate a protest but it's not often done and the protest is usually duly noted and then ignored."

judo,3autq0,sawskankredemption,2,Tue Jun 23 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"Uchimata-sukashi is te-waza and can only be performed as kaeshi-waza (It must come from an attack from uke). It actually requires very little effort. Uke does most of the job, you just sidestep and continue his movement to throw him. 'Sukashi' means something along the lines of; 'side-step'. There are 2 general ways of performing uchimata-sukashi. The first being to sidestep and avoid the uchimata all-together and use your hands to pull him down similar to uki-otoshi. The other is to raise your leg over uke and press him down to the ground.  Doba Yoshihisa has a nice demonstration of sukashi, where he demonstrates these two principles. If you use your legs to sweep or reap uke during the counter it becomes uchimata-gaeshi, which is ashi-waza. You want to avoid that when demonstrating this technique, sukashi is purely te-waza :)"
judo,3autq0,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a specific counter to uchi-mata. Like any good counter, it generally requires that the initial technique be either totally anticipated, or have some problems you can exploit. Essentially, it's a te-waza that has you taking advantage of the already circular motion of your opponent's attack leg coming up, while their upper body goes down. It's your job, then, to avoid the attack leg by either lifting your own leg out of the way, or by pivoting. Then, holding onto your partner's sleeve, try to pull it first forward, then down, and finally back, in a tight circle. Done properly, especially on a very committed uchi-mata, they will completely throw themselves in a fairly clean circle.    Here's a pretty solid demo of it: kodokan demo"

judo,3aqt4h,Ryvai,3,Mon Jun 22 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"Since you are taller, the conventional way might be difficult and I don't know your rank to determine your proficiency in Judo. I use koga's variation to get low enough and throw at a more diagonal angle, as many of opponents anticipate my seoi-nage (it's my tokui-waza) and try to side-step it. By getting the leg deep underneath them I can raise up or change the angle to complete the throw. There are all sorts of variations to try, like this. You just have to experiment and find a seoi-nage that works for you. Being a tall guy I see seoi-nage working well in conjunction with tai-otoshi.  EDIT: Here's a video of me hitting that seoi-nage in conjunction with ko-uchi-gari feint (to be allowed to grip same-sided). It's not pretty, but I really wanted the win :p"

I got some advice in case you are interested (especially if you want it to look prettier).  1.Try to be tighter at his shoulder  2.Pull him into a circle step -> kouchi   Kouchi -> ouchi-> seoi harai tsuri komi ashi/ kosoto-gari to attack his left leg osoto -> seoi seoi -> seoi ( sort of a soto makikomi, basically you wrap his arm and turn into him) drag his arm and switch to the 2:0 grip (sumi-gaeshi). you can even throw sumi-gaeshi from your grip (yoko-tomeo-nage as well, but I don't like it)"
judo,3aqt4h,Ryvai,2,Tue Jun 23 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the advice. The seoi->seoi you are mentioning sounds like uchi-makikomi to me. Is that the one? I really need to implement more foot-sweeps into my game, harai-tsurikomi-ashi should definitely be in there. I've seen some yoko-tomoe-nage variations with the 2-on-1 grip, but I haven't experimented much with it yet. I'm usually shorter than my opponents in -81kg, so it might prove effective :p  This one is a bit 'prettier', hehe."
judo,3aqt4h,PartyPope,2,Tue Jun 23 15:53:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I didn't realize the throw had a name, but yeah that‘s the one I meant: Uchi-makikomi. Really simple to learn and quite effective, unfortunately, most people either poste the hand on my hip and/or try to evade my seoi on my turning direction.  I can only judge you by the two videos. In both of them you are a lot stronger and better than your opponents. I'd say you could rotate your shoulders more and be tighter at the shoulder, other than that the seoi looks good. You come back up and have your feet turned, so that's allready two things you are doing better than most. Moreover your timing is good and your pull is strong.  I find that sweeps are the easiest way to dominate people because you either catch or distract your opponent. Once I decided to learn sweeps, it took me just a few months until I was throwing people left and right with them. However, some guys in my team achieve similar results just through grip fighting, but at least a deashi/kosoto would improve your Judo big time, because you can attack both legs that way."

You will figure out other patterns that suit your style through usage though.  I only posted these particular ones because they work well from his ippon seoi grip and I can attest to their sucess from first hand. I stopped using the ippon seoi grip as much, when leg grabs got increasingly popular and never really went back. It is still a stable option 2b in my game though and has won me numerous fights."

judo,3aqt4h,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"Bend at your knees while you enter. Your pulling hand (on Uke's sleeve) should cross in front of you at your eye level, not lower. Keep the pull going throughout the execution. As you execute, straighten your knees. To avoid dropping Uke on his head, pull up on his sleeve as you straighten your knees to finish the execution. Pull them high; this is the safest way to do it."

judo,3aonmt,duchessHS,6,Mon Jun 22 06:20:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting fact: before the advent of boxing gloves, boxers actually often stood strong side forward to have their power hand closer to their opponents, and many MMA fighters (especially wrestlers) keep their wrestling (southpaw) stance. And some fighters stance switch a lot (Dillishaw) or fight from a neutral stance (Rumble Johnson)."
judo,3aonmt,pk618,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:26:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I didn't know that, but it makes sense. Why did the advent of gloves change that, though?"
judo,3aonmt,pk618,3,Mon Jun 22 07:54:42 2015 UTC,"From what I gather there was finally enough protection for the fist that loading up a full power cross wouldn't shatter your hand. And the lack of padding meant a lead straight/jab hit pretty hard so you'd put your power hand forward, mostly use your rear hand to block and parry, and throw quick straights/hooks from the lead hand."
judo,3aonmt,catsarepointy,2,Mon Jun 22 08:15:28 2015 UTC,Karate here. I'm righthanded and even though we switch fairly freely in karate I prefer to have my right side closer to my target because of the speed and dexterity of my dominant side. Easier for me to control or destroy things that way. Switching to get more power can always put into a combination anyway.
judo,3aonmt,pk618,2,Mon Jun 22 12:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yah, plus those step-through stance switching punches more common in karate have similar power and mechanics to a boxer's cross.   Really there isn't a correct answer. For both grappling and striking the best stance is the stable, mobile stance in which you feel most comfortable."
judo,3aonmt,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't matter.  If you're right handed, it's more convenient to start training right foot forward in judo, and left foot forward in boxing, but if you pick one stance and stick with it, you'll do just fine.  Switching will get you killed, particularly if you haven't trained it, but there's no reason someone righthanded can't learn to fight as a southpaw."
judo,3aonmt,da_choppa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:51:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, a proper Judo stance is all about balance and shouldn't have one foot forward in general. Sure, foot movement happens when executing a technique, but that depends on what technique you are executing. I use a traditional lapel-sleeve grip for most throws, and while the lapel hand is naturally a bit further from my body than the sleeve grip hand, it's fairly negligible as far as balance goes. If you are doing Nage Kome or Uchi Kome drills, for instance, your feet should be roughly parallel to each other and square to Uke's body before you start your technique. Obviously, during Randori, this all changes because both of you are moving around, but Judo is all about disrupting your opponent's balance (kuzushi), so part of your goal should be to remain in balance.  edit: And relaxed! Remain relaxed and in balance. If you get yourself into an unbalanced stance, it is very easy to tense up and become somewhat rigid. This makes you very vulnerable."
judo,3aonmt,ReddJudicata,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:42:55 2015 UTC,You should remain balanced of course. But you almost always should have one foot and the same hand forward.
judo,3aonmt,Carlos13th,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:33:39 2015 UTC,I prefer to do Judo in my striking fighting stance (or something close to it) so far personally I am a noob though.   If you train Muay Thai the Clinch is the perfect place to transition from Muay Thai to judo and blend striking and grappling and you can clinch up from either stance.
judo,3aonmt,Anthony126517,-10,Tue Jun 23 22:49:38 2015 UTC,"For MMA Ronda isn't using her Judo. She starts off in a Boxing styles she just happens to be good with throwing strikes with both hands and once clinched she switches to her Judo once grabbed on and in range.  For a street fights, most BJJ fighters block the punch and grab on the striker in a clinch & use a leg takedown. For Judo it's pretty the same thing block the strike,clinch and takedown with a throw. From my experience doing MMA BJJ'er are decent at blocking strikers but Judokas have no idea in this department. I would recommend learning so striking to understand the level changes in the stand up. One more problem with Judo for MMA/Street if your fighting an experience striker the moment you try to turn your back and throw them your putting yourself in a position of getting knocked out. The reason's Ronda's Good at mma is because she has good boxing to close the decent and use her Judo grappling skills to throw her fighters and KO,TKO or to get them on the ground and use her Armbar skills to submit them."

At this point, she dives in for a morote seoi nage (technically seoi otoshi variation), and uses his own forward momentum to unbalance him.  He doesn't know how to react to the throw, so he lands on his face.   It's just beautifully applied judo."

The reason for him landing on his face has little to do with him not knowing ukemi.  Tori is doing the throw incorrectly.  That is why the guy lands on his face.
judo,3amg3w,Sub_Roses,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"You are wrong.   All throws were at one time designed to kill your opponent.   Seoinage may be an ancient jujutsu throw, but I'm 99% sure this particular variation only appeared long after sport grappling was a thing. As a self defense throw it's a rather risky choice.  I was answering OP's question: This is not some obscure lethal version of judo, it's just regular judo. That's, in my view, the beauty of judo: if you ever need to fight for your life, your skills on the tatami translate almost perfectly. You don't need to attempt modified ""lethal"" versions of anything.    The reason for him landing on his face has little to do with him not knowing ukemi.   True. As you must be well aware, spiking uke is a common danger with this throw. However, if uke had been a judoka, he would have tucked his head in and possibly rolled forward landing on his back or at least mitigating the damage. This guy probably panicked and jerked his head backwards, so he landed on his face.   Tori is doing the throw incorrectly.   True again. But she is doing it under the stress of a real fight, against a man who is likely quite a bit stronger than her, and gripping a shirt collar instead of a judogi. I'm willing to cut her some slack here..."

It's Yoko Otoshi or Uki Waza.  I can't tell which, but apparently a lot of other people have trouble distinguishing them too: http://judoinfo.com/nagewaza2.htm  edit: spelling"

judo,3ahkoa,bozo78,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:26:07 2015 UTC,"As demonstrated it is legal, my concern is during the roll. What happens if the arm comes 'very' loose during the pendulum swing? Holding his leg kind of guides him over, which helps. I guess it's all about control. 'Omoplata' can be done in Judo, as long as you demonstrate to the referee that you attack the elbow and not the shoulder, like the 'kimura'. Juniors should be careful with this though, brown belts can be matched up against yellow belts that does not know what to do to defend it, and end up injured. There was a famous match where he won with this technique and the commentators were a bit surprised it worked :p"
judo,3ahkoa,Ryvai,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:21:50 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate what makes it legal/illegal? I had one club teach it to me (and explicitly saying that it's legal) and another tell me that it's illegal.  Same for gyaku ude garami. The sensei that claimed it was legal said that while shoulder locks are illegal, those techniques only stress the shoulder if uke tries to alleviate the pressure on his elbow, and thus it's uke's fault."
judo,3ahkoa,AuspiciousApple,2,Sat Jun 20 09:29:15 2015 UTC,"In BJJ shoulder locks are legal, so when they do 'kimura' (gyaku-ude-garami), 'omoplata' (ashi-sankaku-garami) or kesa-garami, they can crank it over without much attention to the shoulder. When we do these things in Judo we must be careful to have more control and demonstrate that you attack the elbow. At a referee seminar I was attending (with an IJF-A ref.) I demonstrated omoplata and asked if it was okay, he agreed. Try to not bend the entire arm backwards, but lock the elbow in place and kind of twist the arm from there."
judo,3ahkoa,Ryvai,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:46:58 2015 UTC,"Try to not bend the entire arm backwards, but lock the elbow in place and kind of twist the arm from there.

judo,3ahkoa,AuspiciousApple,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:06:53 2015 UTC,I was told that using it to sweep is perfectly all right. As long as it's obvious that you're not blocking the roll it should be fine.
judo,3ahkoa,daleech1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:14:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I thought. But my other sensei said that I should leave uke arm completely straight in that position, which would make it completely useless."

judo,3ahkoa,MrCaptainFantastic,2,Tue Jun 23 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"I can't recall honestly, but in brief I think we discussed it. If memory serves me well bicep slicers are pain appliers. If it done just to cause pain and this is obvious to the referee you risk matte, but if it is less direct, like in an attempt to straighten the arm for juji-gatame, or something similar the ref's might let it slip. But that is not confirmed, I'm pretty sure they won't allow it, but they are not as strict about it if the situation is not blatantly obvious. I'm attending a seminar with the ref's again later this year. I can probably make a list of questions for that time, to straighten out some of these issues :)"

judo,3ahkoa,MrCaptainFantastic,2,Wed Jun 24 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Ryvai (you get promoted?) said, you have to demonstrate control and the fact that you are only attacking the elbow.  If you restrict the motion of your opponent's shoulder where you put them in a position of possible injury you may be disqualified.  Where in the video he is using the tension created by uke grabbing his own inner thigh, uke is restricting his own motion so it is legal."

Also add further techniques to your arsenal that work well in combination with Uchi Mata:  O Uchi Gari: You can try that before Uchi Mata or after it, when Uke blocks  Ko Uchi Gari: Good throw in general. If it fails it makes tori draw back the attacked foot, exposing the other one to O Uchi Gari or Uchi Mata.  O Soto Gari: Same as with Ko Uchi Gari, drawn back foot on one side means attack opportunity for O Uchi Gari or Uchi Mata. In addition to this, you can also try this after O Uchi Gari fails because uke draws back the attacked leg.  This Sumi Gaeshi variant, but with a high collar standard grip instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDF5E879TYk If Uke defends against Uchi Mata by drawing his leg back and lowering his hips,  turn somewhat towards him, ""sit down"" and shovel him over you, with your foot inside his front leg."

Seo nage can be very risky, burn your strength can over come the need to squat and lift your opponent.   Harai goshi I would work with your arms and legs.   Osoto makkomi would help if you had good amount of strength and weight."
judo,3ah7p6,liftinheavythings,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:59:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on your weight class and your movement.  At 6'3 you could well be a +100, and then it depends upon what kind of +100 you are - one who moves (taiotoshi / deashibarai / ko(soto/uchi)gari), or one who wants to set before throwing (osoto / makikomi / uchimata), which is more likely with only a couple of years experience.  If you're a lighter weight you might be taller than a lot of your opponents, which changes the things you might like (dominant grip haraigoshi / osoto / sasae).  You also only have 2 years of experience. My recommendation would be to 'try everything' and find what works. When I started I liked osotogari and haraigoshi. A couple years later it was uchimata and a lot of the more subtle ashiwaza. A couple years after that it was taiotoshi and way more ashiwaza. It changes as your judo matures."
judo,3ah7p6,Ryvai,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"Being a tall guy you have a few advantages;   You can more easily get the neck / over-the-back grips, which can dictate your opponents posture more easily. But I would not focus on that at yellow-belt, make sure you learn the proper tsurikomi action before delving into the back grips etc, but it works wonders for shiai. Long legs equals uchi-mata, harai-goshi, or other ashi-waza. Learn uchi-mata yesterday and make it your tokui-waza. You have an easier time putting shorter guys on their toes by tsurikomi and movement. Study how to unbalance your opponents prior to throwing."

It's a real eye-opener. We Judo guys are good at specific situations, but there are so many gaps in our game in-between. BJJ is highly recommended to improve your ground-game.  4) Unfortunately we offer only the current IJF-style Judo. Many of the Judoka doing randori are competitors and don't want to bother with leg-grab randori. The sensei shows leg-grabs if you ask him about it, but not otherwise. One of our female veterans offers self-defense course for women sometimes :)"
judo,3afj3g,Ryvai,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"Ryval - how do you find the turn over of BJJ guys? How do they go with IJF standard judo? Presumably they're there to fill in gaps for their BJJ, so they'd be interested in things like leg grabs and pick ups.  I teach at at a BJJ place and none of the guys compete in IJF shiai, so I show them the full suite of things (te-guruma, kibisu geshi, morote gari etc). I figure it's good for me (to at least keep them fresh in mind) and for them, well...they can use it!   Also: do you teach any Newaza to the BJJ guys?"

When I've done randori with some of the BJJ guys I let them go for the legs, it doesn't bother me. Even if they cannot do leg take-downs they learn a lot about stand-up, posture and gripping. They are very humble and respect Judo a lot, like I respect their vicious ground-game. The thing that different about Judo and BJJ is that we usually give up our backs a lot, which is a luxury situation for them. I've seen some BJJ guys be surprised about our entry into sankaku-jime from turtle position, it's unorthodox for them. Give them another weapon for the tool-box and they will be more than happy to accept the teachings. In my experience, 3 ne-waza weapons that BJJ guys underestimate; ude-hishigi-ude-gatame, sode-guruma-jime and yoko-sankaku-jime :)"

Also no one seemed to even bother retaining their guard."
judo,3afkdo,user079,0,Fri Jun 19 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"I think I agree. It seems to me that a lot of the ""jujitsu"" places that practice tachiwaza randori do it so-so...and a lot of the judo places that do atemi-waza / self defense are equally lackluster. Why is it so difficult to find videos of somewhere  that is equally good at both tachiwaza, newaza and atemi waza? The best bet seems to be to look at sambo or yoseikan budo for integration!   Irrespective, I don't want to piss on their parade (good on them for doing this; many places wouldn't!) but I have to wonder if more bang-for-buck couldn't be had with straight judo. Looking at the YT channel, it seems as if 90% of what they do is judo based anyway."
judo,3afkdo,AuspiciousApple,2,Fri Jun 19 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"As a former jitsuka, yes, their tachi waza is modified judo techniques. Most of their training is drilling a defensive move with a compliant uke who starts with an attack which tori defends. The instructors are usually very good at teaching, they practice ukemi religiously so are quite adept at falling, but 90% of their training is with compliant partners which is why they struggle at randori. I also never saw combinations practiced."
judo,3afkdo,silvaphysh13,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"MMA is probably the best bet.  The reason why atemi-waza is usually bad is that it's practiced live. What makes judo work is randori, both for tachi and ne waza. But no one really does atemi-waza randori."

The japanese termanology (according to this guys answer) functions as a ""lingua franca"" that allows say a dutch man and a zimbabwean who both are practicing o-soto gari in the same dojo, they don't have to sit there and translate, because they've all learned the Japanese. Somone can just say uchi komi, O-goshi... and everyone knows just what they mean. if you just had some brash american shouting practice your hip throws, any non english speaker has to wait and watch others to figure out what's going on."

judo,3a8toq,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Thu Jun 18 08:34:50 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely interested and would like the long answer if you don't mind :)
judo,3a8toq,PoachedEggsOnToast,13,Thu Jun 18 09:28:09 2015 UTC,"Okay then...   Why can't we all just get along :'(   Humans are a tribal species. Being a recognized part of a group is an evolutionary advantage, for it provides protection and in some cases even heightens the the probability to reproduce.  Also groups themselves, even if their members are interchangeable, are centered around concepts, ideas and sometimes cultural memes. Groups can, like living organisms preserve, mutate and pass on their memes.  For identifiying with your tribe it is necessary to know what defines it and what doesn't. When confronted with strangers or outsiders we notice the biggest differences first. Foreign/opposing ideas, memes and even genes may be considered harmful for the stability of the group. ""The strange and unknown is to be mistrusted"". It's called xenophobia and is often the origin of predjudices, racism and other negative phenomena.  In short: tribes protect themselves by holding on to real or imagined differences towards other tribes.  Another important factor is the individual worldview. Neurologically spoken each of us lives in a virtual reality provided by our own brain, that is a more or less accurate simulation of the real world around us. This virtual reality, our worldview, is a model that is constantly updated via information we percept through our senses. Interestingly only 10% of what you just ""see"" is new information, most of what you believe to percept are just memories.  This worldview not only contains information about where what is, but also social, cultural, educational and other data. It's the big bundle of everything you know and what you associate with it. This includes how you value it, what you consider good, bad, true, wrong, sexy, ugly and so on.  The worldview is what makes you You. It is not a disembodied vague thing, but pyhsically hardwired into your brain. Bridges and connections have been built up there throughout your life and the whole structure becomes more solid and stable the older you get.  The problem with this is: If an information is deeply hardwired into your brain, it requires an actual physical rebuilt of that structure to accept a change of that information. This costs your body a lot of resources. No other organ requires such a big amount of energy such as the brain. Thus evolution basically made us stubborn when it comes to accept information that contradicts our worldview. It is uneconomical to change our mind. Instead your brain will most likely distort the information until it fits in with the existing one. That's the reason why there are still people out there who believe the most absurd things although there is a ton of information to debuk it.  It also explains, why it is impossible to reason with extremists. At least in short term. They cannot flip a switch and just accept an opposed worldview. A sudden rebuilt of a big structure in the brain is just physically impossible.  This had little to do with Judo now, but I hope it sheds some light on why people can be so complicated at times. :)"
judo,3a8toq,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Thu Jun 18 11:50:38 2015 UTC,Awesome answer Geschichtenerzaehler! I was more looking for why bjj people and judo people don't get on but this kind of answers that question. Thanks for taking your time to write that essay :s
judo,3a8toq,PoachedEggsOnToast,2,Fri Jun 19 07:37:47 2015 UTC,"Welcome. I thought your question was about mankind in general and thus gave a general answer. :)  I practice both Judo and BJJ, and I met a number of guys who do the same. There are no general walls between these styles here. Some people build them around themselves, but fortunately that seems to be an exception. Usually Judoka recognize BJJ's ne waza skills and BJJists recognize Judo's tachi waza skills."

judo,3a8toq,cujo26,11,Thu Jun 18 07:52:58 2015 UTC,"Okay... I don't know if it is true or not, but it's a dojo storm story of a different kind ...  This happened a long time ago, it may have been around 1880, when Jigoro Kano was still practicing Tenshin Shin'yo Ryu under Masamoto Iso sensei. Young Kano worked incredibly hard to improve his skills. His old gi -repaired countless times and covered in stains of sweat and blood- bears witness to his efforts. When he was finally on his way to become the dojo's best student, a stranger appeared. He sat by the side and watched the session in silence, then left without saying a word.  The mysterious visitor repeated this routine for a few sessions, then, after a few days he requested Masamoto sensei, if he could join the training. Masamoto agreed.  The stranger asked Kano to do randori with him, and Kano confidently accepted. The man seemed to be an ordinary beginner, but when Jigoro tried to throw him, his opponent immediatly countered his technique and pinned him down. While Kano was still struggleing to get out, the visitor suddenly released his grip,  bowed and thanked him.  After that the stranger disappeared, never to return, leaving Kano behind with the lesson, that overconfidence can betray you."

After that you can only be as competitive as your body allows. Some, like my coach, compete into their 40's, some 50's, some stop in their 20's.

judo,3a7l1h,Anthropolygon,3,Thu Jun 18 04:41:48 2015 UTC,"It's not that easy. If we allow leg-grabs again, will we return to seeing the hunched over jacket-wrestling or will we see a more entertaining Judo? That question will be answered during the Olympics in 2016. So far the statistics show more 'spectacular' ippons (the big throws) and less negative (less entertaining) stalling tactics. Don't get me wrong, I like leg-grabs, but at what cost? It's a double-edged sword. I need to see some numbers and statistics first. After the Olympics we will probably see more fruitful discussions on the matter."
judo,3a7l1h,Ryvai,5,Wed Jun 17 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that the leg grab rules weren't the only rules to change. We can't fairly compare the two because there are other variables at play (change of shido rules, more specific guidelines for referees as to what constitutes stalling etc). My opinion is that the leg grabs were just one type of attack that were at times abused for stalling. Think of bad ""drop seois"" or poor foot sweeps to ""look active"" etc. To me there is no difference between a false attack by grabbing at the legs and turtling and a false attack by pretending to do seoi otoshi and turtling. Referees now are much more strict on people doing the bad seoi otoshis so I can't see why it would not have worked for bad morote garis or kibitsu gaeshis. I'm not saying I'm right but I'm still not convinced the leg grab rules solved a problem so much as removed a single (albeit easily identified) symptom of a problem."

judo,3a7l1h,bushikris,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:18:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the rules are changed to allow leg grabs. I think a few simple rules workable. Penalise poor posture without attacking. Penalise false attacks. We already have these rules, just apply them."
judo,3a7l1h,Ryvai,2,Wed Jun 17 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"It's not that easy either. If leg-grabs are allowed, we will see less of the big spectacular throws, because one of the counters to a beautiful uchimata is te-guruma, for example, be it for yuko. So people will hesitate. This what we have statistics for. After the new rules, more of these big throws are appearing, as the risk of being countered is less, so there is more commitment to it. If you are hesitant to attempt these throws it will get more boring, in my opinion. Wait for the Olympics in rio to pass, then there will be some interesting rule-change discussions :)"
judo,3a7l1h,trumfnator,2,Wed Jun 17 23:50:01 2015 UTC,"Uchimata kaeshi, works well against uchimata, and uchimata sukashi.  But I preferred orange and te-uchimata (a.k.a. sukuinage) I frequently used to get Ippon from that, rarely yuko. Techniques disallowed for cosmetic reasoning is my logic for this thread. I agree with many of your points, and thank-you for commenting.  I don't agree with the ""make judo good looking"" for the Olympics lobby. BJJ have helped me there. Let's make our judo inclusive rather than exclusive. Perhaps instead of moving away from leg grabs and newaza to brand judo, we should be looking to align judo closer to absorb our sister art BJJ? I know referees like big changes to rules to wait till after Olympics for the sake of the athletes. I agree about this."
judo,3a7l1h,Suey13,3,Thu Jun 18 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"As long as the idea for making judo-rules is to ""please the spectator"" so long there will be flawed rules. It just won't work and it's totally not in line with a martial art rooted in japan.  Anyways, an idea for getting back the leg grabs:   no yuko anymore: this could lead to that only really commited attacks (be it leg grabs or ""traditional"" throws) will score. No more getting safe yuko from defensive positions and stall the rest of the fight. more time for newaza: poor executed attacks/leg grabs from defensive positions can be exploited to get an advantage in ne waza.   But again. With the current leadership of international judo, I don't think there will be any change to the better.  edit: another idea would be a culture of more diverse rules. for example: It seems to be an ordinary thing in bjj to compete in gi, no-gi, submission only, points, 20 min. etc. I would like to see something similar in judo."
judo,3a7l1h,trumfnator,2,Thu Jun 18 00:09:50 2015 UTC,"Regarding newaza:  A player has plenty of opportunity to engage in techniques.  A referee's prerogative is to restart a match from standing once positive progress has been deemed to have been halted.  A player is allowed to work as long as they are making progress.  If it happens that a referee is not educated enough to be able to recognize certain techniques then those referees need more training in that regard.  I've seen matches continuously flow on the ground for up to 2 minutes with players exchanging who is in control.  If a player can show progress, they can work as long as they want."

judo,3a7l1h,Suey13,3,Thu Jun 18 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"The IJF referees commission isn't who decided to ban grabs/blocking below the belt.  EDIT:  No.  Judo has become more fluid and dynamic, with an emphasis on being upright and attacking.  Before people would shoot for a morote gari and just fall to the floor and turtle, too much stalling tactics."
judo,3a7l1h,bozo78,3,Wed Jun 17 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"I would feel better to know the pathway to changing rules in judo. It seems many judoka are leaving judo because of the new rules not being smart for self defence, and they prefer to leg grab. Many are jumping to BJJ, and other similar codes. I don't like to see our sport/martial art weakened."
judo,3a7l1h,Ryvai,2,Wed Jun 17 23:41:16 2015 UTC,Changes to the rules are instituted by the International Judo Federation Executive Committee (which includes in its membership the Referee Director).
judo,3a7l1h,trumfnator,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:08:04 2015 UTC,"People say that...but I've yet to see any stats to support the idea that people are leaving judo over leg grabs. I think people leave judo because too many judo clubs offer a sub-standard, anachronistic experience...but that's a different topic.  Re: leg grabs. I just don't know. I miss them sometimes but there's no denying that people appear more empowered to go for big throws now.  I guess a good offshoot from this discussion might be ""what do leg grabs add to shiai""."
judo,3a7l1h,silvaphysh13,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"Certainly the rules were weak around this. Another way to stop poor attempts might be feasible. We did penalize shido for false attacks, (previously used with success) OR we could penalise poor posture without attacking as well. Both these methods would also solve the problem without banning leg grabs."
judo,3a7l1h,Ryvai,2,Wed Jun 17 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"No-one wants to see matches won by shido because of poor attacks. We want to see spectacular throws and upright Judo without the risk of an stalling opponent that just waits for you to shoot in, only to score yuko and win after 3 minutes of shidos. Statistics support the new rules :)"
judo,3a7l1h,trumfnator,4,Wed Jun 17 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"You can argue judo was characterised by big throws, upright posture and a willingness to adapt successful new techniques into the system. The wrestlers certainly tested our rules in the past. I just think that the cost of banning leg grabs to do stand up judo, has evolved judo into a Greco roman jackets on wrestling system. We need to evolve back to leg grabs without getting back to poor posture and yuko judo. I think it crazy that i can't put my hand down to fend a tomoenage attack, for fear of DQ. I liked the big throws Kata guruma, sukuinage, even tackles have a place because they work. Cosmetic reasoning evolving judo rules is (IMHO) poor rationale. Statistics can mislead. Lets use common sense reasoning to shape judo. Certainly if judo is broken then replace the correct faulty parts, not take away important items in the tool kit, or we can't easily do the job in hand."
judo,3a7l1h,Ryvai,2,Thu Jun 18 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"This whole problem is very complex. For example: Apart from the reasons Kano stated in his writings, I think an upright posture is much more consequential when you look at the fighting time of old contest-rules: a fight could go up to 20 min. An upright/natural posture is much more energy-efficent to fight for 20 min than an hunched-over posture. Also you can't to extensive grip-fighting for 20 min. A perfect timed big throw would be the most energy-efficent solution to win the fight. But this could also lead to boring fights which is nothing the IJF would do today."
judo,3a7l1h,bushikris,3,Thu Jun 18 00:31:07 2015 UTC,"The frantic gripping and go style that is judo today isn't as beautiful as judo with settled grips judo of 20 years ago. Bring back settled grips, and big throws. The IJF (or whoever) interfering into Judo rules for the sakes of a more marketable product for uninformed spectators is a poor rule change vehicle. Let them watch sumo wrestling instead? That's clearly a spectator sport. Judo is complex, it's rules a nightmare. We could easily evolve the rules to be more inclusive, rather than less. I actually thought some mention of no gi judo contesting alternative deserves more study, and has merit."
judo,3a7l1h,bigbaze2012,8,Thu Jun 18 00:39:29 2015 UTC,YES   return to legal leg grabs in contest

judo,3a7l1h,pk618,2,Wed Jun 17 21:46:34 2015 UTC,"They tried that, it was a nightmare for the competitors and referees and completely confusing for the spectator. We need some really creative ideas on how to compromise to make rules allow leg-grabs but still be crystal-clear for the referees and audience."
judo,3a7l1h,pk618,2,Wed Jun 17 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"you mean leg grabs as part of combinations or counters? The funny thing regarding this is: (I think this was in 2013 when they had experimental rules)   they tried to reffing a match with video-support but abandoned it then they tried the leg grabs only for counters/combinations, they abandoned because of the reasons you stated then in 2014 they introduced the video-support all the same. Why did they no try the leg grabs for counters/combinations WITH video-support?"
judo,3a7l1h,JoeDwarf,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's that testing period I'm referring to. I remember it being pretty difficult to grasp. Too much interpretation from the referee's side. It was a really confusing time :p"
judo,3a7l1h,Ryvai,2,Thu Jun 18 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"NO to leg grabs in anything leading to rankings (nationals, worlds, grand prix, olympics)  YES to allowing them in local and state, or just allowing us to have ijf sanctioned submission grappling tournaments.  I feel like this is could let us meet in the middle."
judo,3a7l1h,JoeDwarf,2,Thu Jun 18 09:13:34 2015 UTC,Here is my pitch: make all leg takedowns a waza ari that demands newaza immediately after. No ippons can be made from leg takedowns. This way we have the best of both worlds.  You'll have the traditional players standing up right to get their good ippong. And more diligent fighters looking for doubles and singles and to engage in a longer newaza battle.  Thoughts?
judo,3a7l1h,JoeDwarf,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:56:58 2015 UTC,You are missing the point of the new rules.  They were not meant to prevent throws.  They were meant to prevent people blocking throws via grabbing the leg.

Penalize for stalling and false attacks and over-defensive posture. Penalize negative Judo, reward effective grappling.  If it's in the gokyo no waza, I should be able to use it in shiai."

Otaki and Draeger's ""Judo-Formal Techniques"", one of the best kata books out there, also has a short look at Judo's history.     It is difficult to find well researched material about the history of Judo in English. If you can tolerate a certain amount of unbacked anecdotes, myths and factual errors, the choices get broader very quickly though.  ""The Way of Judo: A Portrait of Jigoro Kano and His Students"" by John Stevens contains a lot of information. Unfortunately the author fails to link his findings directly to the sources (which are listed in the back, but not linked to markers in the text). I could identify some factual errors (Kano's 12th dan for example) and am afraid there are more. It seems facts and myths go hand and hand here and it is often impossible to tell, where which one begins and where it ends.  ""Judo through the Looking Glass"" is a collection of mostly personal anecdotes centered around British Judo. Quite entertaining at times (the best story is ""The man who bit the belt"", which is also available online though), but no general Judo history.    Some of the better sources I can think of are written in German (that doesn't mean there aren't any in English, but I just don't know them)."

judo,3a49b7,ProfHotTub,3,Wed Jun 17 16:19:25 2015 UTC,I'll be starting my first Judo Class this week and just curious if you all have any general recommendations for staying healthy/injury prevention. I'm 30 years old and would like to make a commitment so as to avoid injury.   I already have a very fit athletic background working out pretty much everyday for over 15 years. I've done about 2 years bjj but am transitioning to Judo as for some reason I'm prone to skin infection with close proximity ground grappling. I actually was obsessed with Bjj but it's the only MA that appears to give me this issue. I've done small circle jiu-jitsu for about 2 years (until I moved) which incorporated judo throws. Only time I ever really tweaked my back was during falling sideways on my hip while practicing these throws in class.
judo,3a49b7,silvaphysh13,5,Wed Jun 17 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"The best thing every Judoka -new or not- can do to avoid injury, is to practice and refine one's breakfalls diligently.  Other than that you can...   ... wear a mouthguard in randori. Forbidden in tournament, but other than that, why not protecting the teeth. Extra cardio training comes as a bonus. ... avoid practicing with wild newbies. People who show lack of control over their power and technique are more likely to cause injury. ... avoid barefoot warm up soccer or rugby games if your coach does something like that. Some of the worst injuries I witnessed over the years happened during such games. ... always warm up properly. make sure your body feels supple before you practice throws or other techniques. ... if allowed, wear a rashguard under your gi."
judo,3a49b7,ProfHotTub,3,Wed Jun 17 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"Seconding the ukemi advice. If you practice and drill falls a zillion times, you'll be much more relaxed in randori. Most of the worst judo injuries I've seen have been from inexperienced judoka who stiffen up and resist throws too strongly."

I'm tall and overweight (working on it!) and didn't have this pain prior to starting Judo, which also means prior to exercising in any appreciable way.   Is this abnormal? Thanks in advance!"
judo,3a49b7,Ryvai,3,Wed Jun 17 03:28:38 2015 UTC,"In Judo we practice barefoot. Being overweight is not necessarily the cause of the pain, but adds to it. When we walk with shoes we don't train all of the muscles that are normally used for walking (stabilizing etc.). This is why babies should walk barefoot constantly and not be put on socks or baby-shoes. It helps them understand more quickly how the feet work and thus learn to walk faster and gain better balance by training said muscles. So, to the point. It could be that you are not used to the barefoot training and the muscles are sore from all the 'action' it has to do to stabilize your posture. But then again I'm just an armchair Judo doctor :p"

Ask your instructor if he/she is fine with that.   Not sure I want to picture someone killing my dad though.   Just the extremest example I heard of. You don't have to do that though. The idea is simply to ""flip the switch to fight"" before you enter the mat. Try to figure out your method for that. I just gave some examples."
judo,3a396m,PartyPope,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:32:57 2015 UTC,Is being angry essential?  Can't I still win with a zen-master-like mindset?  Softness controls hardness?
judo,3a396m,PartyPope,2,Sat Jun 20 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"You must be willing to attack and to seize the opportunities that arise. You also shouldn't be desoriented or planless in the first second of the fight. All this requires a certain mindset. It doesn't have to be anger though. Complete focus is probably better. Ideally you gotta be the dead calm eye in the center of the storm.  The problem is (even involuntarily) confusing being dead calm with being inactive or passive. So until you got that down right, a bit aggression might help you being active and overcoming fear.  The problem is, I cannot really help you. You must find out, in what mindest you perform best. Then you must find out how you get there. My examples merely described what works for others. :)"

judo,3a396m,fleischlaberl,2,Sun Jun 21 03:43:53 2015 UTC,"1) Friend of mine had exercise-induced asthma. So here is what he did: he traiedn for rapid strength and tried to throw his opponents early. If that didn't work he would play very energy efficient if you want to call it that. For example he only used Ne-waza techniques that stressed his opponent, but took little effort for himself, which means he wouldn't go for a juji or choke, unless they clearly presented themselves. Otherwise he would go for a ""bodyweight type turnover"". When he was out of breath he would stall a little in kumi-kata (not enough to get penalized). Also he tied his belt (s) loosely, so they would fall off during the competition and give him a breather.   2) Compete more and do the same warm up routine you would do in your club. When you are off the mat, don't sit around all the time and brood, instead walk around and have a chat or do some tandoku rensho or Uchi-komi. Finally, it is also a matter of simply getting used to competitions. Breathing as mentioned by /u/Ryvai helps, too.  3) What I do against this type of one trick pony seoi people:    Get a double lapel and then slowly move your main hand upwards into a power grip position. Don't be afraid to sort of hang on them. Put pressure on them downwards. You can increase the strain by moving backwards and yanking them even further down or attacking them with ashi-waza techniques from your forwarded leg. Even simple feints with your hip will make you look active, while they will earn shidos. Why double lapel instead of regular power grip? Well, I throw seoi myself and when they come up that is a great time for me to attack, also they can't attack me with seoi because I block their shoulder through my lower lapel arm. If you feel confident with regular power grip, then that is fine as well. Just be careful during grip fighting not to get thrown while you are trying to get a grip.  Hikkomi-gaeshi works really well"

judo,3a396m,fleischlaberl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:33:11 2015 UTC,"Stopped reading after: ""no videos - sorry"" - sorry!  no ;-)  1) First thing is not to ""bring up the cardio"" - first thing is ""not to burn such an amount of energy. Judos core principle is ""seiryoku zenyo"" (best use of mind and body / minimum effort, maximum efficiency). Thats not only a principle for flowing technique (waza), its a principle for whole shiai too. If you have a ""homebase"" where you can't be thrown you don't have to be in fear of getting thrown whole the time. imo the key for this ""homegame"" is natural posture, good bodymovement and know how to defend via bodymovement. Arms are like chains - sometimes loose and sometimes stiff and the power  cames from the COG in defending and attacking.  2) Very honest and I appreciate this! Best thing would be to open your mind but this is a shi... advice for someone, who is extremly nervous in competition.  So my advice is to concentrate on deep breathing, short intake and loooong outtake. Breathing has nothing to do with thinking but gives you oxygen, let you concentrate your thoughts on something, which has nothing to do with technique or strategy and your pulse rate is slowing down.  3) Go backwards and in circles and move the with your bodyweight. The one who does stiffarming, has to follow. There will be in opening, if he moves, but you dont have to think on a specific throw. Move them!   Congratulations for competing!!  ."
judo,3a1pym,kitcheo,6,Tue Jun 16 15:26:38 2015 UTC,Sounds like they are doing it the right way.  You have to walk before you can run.  Emphasis at the beginning will be on proper technique and ukemi-waza before getting into too much tachi-waza (throwing) because if you can't fall properly there is a higher chance of being injured.  Ne-waza is easier to jump into right away because there is less injury risk.
judo,3a1pym,Suey13,2,Tue Jun 16 15:56:09 2015 UTC,That explains why we were allowed to learn more newaza techniques than tachiwaza so far. Everything is making sense now. I guess I went into Judo with very different expectations!

judo,3a1pym,silvaphysh13,3,Tue Jun 16 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that shiai (contest) is often very over-emphasized in many dojos. I think you'll get a more well-rounded and thorough judo education at a more traditional school. This sounds like a pretty good place. Make sure you're practicing lots of ukemi-waza (falling techniques) for the first couple months, and I guarantee it will make randori much more fun and productive once you guys get into it."
judo,3a1pym,BudLackBrian,3,Tue Jun 16 15:45:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't know if it's common practice, but couple of places around me won't even teach falling for a month or two. Some BJJ places don't even teach anything judo related for half a year (I think Clark Gracie might be an exception)  I'm also tournament-oriented, but I still love learning ""street-legal"" techniques on the side."
judo,3a1pym,AuspiciousApple,3,Tue Jun 16 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"couple of places around me won't even teach falling for a month or two.    Why? It's not like two months of ne-waza make it safer to fall, and basic ukemi seems very safe anyway. And you can start with sitting or kneeling ukemi anyway."
judo,3a1pym,dermanus,2,Tue Jun 16 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. The fluency with ukemi comes from doing it a lot. To do it a lot, you have to do it a lot. Doing ukemi across the mat can be a good part of warm up."
judo,3a1pym,necrotelecomnicon,2,Tue Jun 16 19:02:23 2015 UTC,"Ukemi should, imo, be part of every warmup, every class. It's just too important to skimp on. Once saw a blue belt dislocate his elbow at a regional tournament because he tried to stop his fall with his hand, rather than roll with it; grown man cry etc.  We start white belts with just lying on the side, learning to hit the mat properly before progressing to sitting, kneeling and partner assisted drills. For more experienced players we'll do things like flip-ukemi just for the fun of it."
judo,3a1pym,dermanus,2,Tue Jun 16 19:11:36 2015 UTC,"My dojo practices ukemi in warmup every class without fail, for both Judo and Jujitsu so essentially we get double the practice in one night. I feel lucky that this is the case because I became quite comfortable with breakfalls relatively quickly. It's great to hear that my dojo is doing it right."
judo,3a1pym,ahapkidoin,2,Tue Jun 16 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"That's a big sigh of relief to hear. I'm not sure why, but I've always had the idea that shiai focused Judo was the best way to learn. I've gotten pretty comfortable with side breakfalls by now, but I have yet to test front and back breakfalls from a throw."
judo,3a1pym,bobaf,2,Tue Jun 16 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"Randori is only occasional, but I assume that's because we're all white-belts (sensei mentioned there'll be more randori very soon as our basics have improved).   This sounds like good sense. Randori is an important part of judo, but when there are lots of beginners you do want to be more careful about how it's done."
judo,3a1pym,twan55,2,Tue Jun 16 19:04:28 2015 UTC,At first I was worried because I wasn't seeing much randori in the classes. But that's before I realised that everybody was a white belt! Some of the guys were allowed to practice randori because they were more experienced and had a higher belt in Jujitsu already. But it's good to hear from everyone here that sensei is running things safely and properly. I'll put my faith in sensei to teach us well :)

If someone holds me in this pin (controlling my right hand), I shrimp to my left, use my left hand and place it firmly on his right elbow and try to free my right hand by pulling it out. I then try to either shrimp out to pull some guard or roll over to my stomach."

judo,3a0isq,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, something like that. The variation in the picture you posted is slightly different than the one I meant. In your example, (portrayed from the bottom) I try to free my right arm and get it under the opponent and place it on his hip (at belt level), push and shrimp off to regain guard (uke between my legs). Not easy, but it can be done by wriggling.   In my experience, a very common application of ushiro-kesa-gatame is done from a slightly different position, wrapping the hand around you. Picture doing soto-makikomi forwards, you land then turn around while holding one of uke's arms in your armpits, and assumes the ushiro position. An example can be seen in this video or here. This seems much more powerful and difficult to escape from.  The first step to escape it is then to free your arm, using both hands, then shrimp out of the position :)"

Nevertheless its wounderful,  when Judoka dont stop with competition after 30/35 or even after they have reached ""shodan"", cause they only needed the points.

I am not sure how you would position yourself for a clock choke, but yes, I think like that. Yes.    Is the arm motion the same as in this[1]   turnover?   Not quite. Imagine that Tori wants to go for a Hadaka-jime or Rear-naked choke, but goes under the armpit. So the same motion that you'd do for the choke, but you go under the arm and get your hand past his chin all the way to the back of his neck.   No, tori's legs stay on the outside. The movement works by tori falling on his back, pulling with the left, pushing with the right arm and once he is on his back he pushes with his feet to finish the movement.   Does that make it clearer? It looked kind of strange at first, but seemed to work very well."

The first mandatory sex test issued by the IAAF for woman athletes was in July 1950 in the month before the European Championships in Belgium. All athletes were tested in their own countries.  Sex testing at the games began at the 1966 European Athletics Championships in response to suspicion that several of the best women athletes from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were actually men.  At the Olympics, testing was introduced at the 1968 Olympic Winter Games in Grenoble. While it arose primarily from the Olympic Games, gender verification affects any sporting event. However, it most often becomes an issue in elite international competition.    Image i - South African athlete Caster Semenya was cleared to continue competing as a woman after gender testing by the IAAF.

So far all her victories are against women with poor fight records.  It might be a chicken and egg problem where the women with good records don't want to risk them by facing her, but I still want to see that change before I get too worked up about her entering MMA.

judo,39pxwl,bozo78,4,Sat Jun 13 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"I cross train both (Judo for a while, BJJ more recently - 2.5 years now), you'll need to adapt judo newaza for submission grappling. For instance, with judo, I train with a competitor in the Commonwealth games representing Australia and other guys who have excellent tachiwaza. Cross training has made me much more aware of other submissions and positions that my judo training partners have not really encountered, so despite their superiority in judo, they're finding me quite difficult during groundwork over time.  You'll really need to practice technique with the submission grappling rules in mind (e.g. check if you can do ankle locks, gi/no-gi?)."
judo,39pxwl,ChristianDefence88,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:25:20 2015 UTC,Our dojo has sent multiple people to sub-grappling and BJJ tournaments. They usually do well. In fact one girl won beginner absolute two years in a row.
judo,39pxwl,pk618,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the whole thing it's starting to feel like a time warp to me. To clarify that, my club does 2 hour practices. The first hour is all newaza  (groundwork), and the second half is for standing. This, in my experience, is the norm and not the exception for a lot, if not the majority, of the American southeast (excluding the big city clubs coached by former world champs and such). In the early 2000's we saw an explosion of BJJ clubs open up, and what followed was an explosion of BJJ and submission grappling tournaments. In these tournies, it quickly became hard to tell the difference between the judo guys and the bjj guys other than certain preferances that manifest on a club to club basis. Within 5 or 6 six years the debates about who had the better grappling went from which system, to which club produced the best fighters. We had all learned each other's leg locks and sleeve chokes as well as how to fight in or pass variants of the guard. This seemed to put the issue to bed until recently. Now it's starting all over again.  To this day I firmly believe the fighter (especially well rounded cross trainers), and not the art presents who will be dominant on any occasion.  TL:DR other than the fancy high level stuff there isn't much difference in groundwork."
judo,39pxwl,bushikris,4,Sat Jun 13 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"My club holds periodic newaza-only meets.  The rules are: competitors start from kneeling position, standing is only allowed for specific attacks (otherwise matte is called), two minute bouts, judo rules.  I've found that, with these rules, judo players tend to win even over BJJ purple belts. The BJJ guys are not used to quick fights, and they are normally baffled by pins.   Conversely, I've rolled with BJJ guys. Generally I do ok, but when I achieve a pin I go like ""so... what now? How can I get to a submission from here?""  I feel this illustrates the fundamental differences between newaza and BJJ. Judokas train to transition smoothly from tachiwaza to newaza, go for the pin, escape from the opponents' pin, move explosively, attack the turtle, and only attempt submissions when they present themselves.   BJJ guys train to work slowly and methodically. They have a much richer arsenal of techniques, especially guard passes and sweeps, which rarely occur in judo. They aren't used to pinning or escaping pins, since the pin is only a mean to an end for them. They typically know several ways to submit you from each hold, and how to combine them in ways we judokas never drill."
judo,39pxwl,SVPPB,2,Sun Jun 14 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"That highlights a lot of the changes we made back in the day to integrate the groundwork so that we could stay competitive on the ground. Drilling multiple submissions out of pins and adding complex guard drills to our curriculum. Although, to be honest we still don't mess with the rare submissions like the von flug choke (I'm sure I butchered the spelling on that one). But the average athlete in either sport is, well, average. He works simple techniques, makes simple mistakes, and wins or loses to simple submissions. Most of the time anyways."

judo,39pxwl,dzendian,-3,Sun Jun 14 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference In BJJ/Submission grappling over Judo. First in BJJ for example you get 2 points for a takedown,3 for passing the guard and 4 for mount. Also one really bad habit Judokas have is giving up there back because not only are you give the guy your fighting an advantage,points for taking your back (putting hooks in) they are allowed to push of your head/face with there hands and feet most Judokas have a really hard time. Second with be the attacks & position not in Judo or not used in good. Example position X-Guard,DRV Guard,Rubber guard,standing passes,Turk & Attacks Leg locks,kneebars,toe holds & heel hooks & wrist locks. 3rd one would be pulling guard one they do that your stand up is useless under these rules your not allowed to slam or you will get DQ and the guard pulls are annoying at times because it can be done at point of the fight. Judo would give you an advantage for the grips and Throws and sweeps in the Gi for sure but one on the ground you can't just pin the guy and stay there that's called stalling and would end up you losing a point & what about no-Gi, hand control is just as important as grip fighting and if you never trained it before it will be hard and also under hooks for no-Gi is the way to go and learning sprawl is key to defend takedowns. Does Judo work yes, you will have good stand up and ok groundwork but if you work all these things I have listed you will do great if not who knows. Just my thought."

I think it's a freestyle wrestling technique (it doesn't matter though, once you cross train, you'll soon notice how much the lines are blurred between all those grapping arts out there).

Both attempts looked forced (adding 'suplex' lifting action). My understanding is that once kuzushi is established, you are supposed to 'let-go' with the legs, 'dissapearing' underneath, then your body should act as a counterweight. If done correctly, you can 'snatch' your opponnent off his feet with pretty good speed. (like how a 'bolo' spins through the air...) but, who am I to judge if he can make it work."

There, there are live brackets during tournaments, completed brackets for about a week or so after the tournament, and the draws as soon as they are up. The next tournament to watch is this weekend in Budapest. We have some us players fighting. The ijf website has a list of upcoming tournaments most of which will be broadcasted live. Ippon.tv uses YouTube for their live broadcasts which means past tournaments or yesterday's elimination rounds and finals round, fights for third and first, are available for viewing. Even though it often for us viewers in during god awful hours I find much more exiting to watch live. You can find them usually by searching YouTube for the tournament name and year. Then there is judobase.org where you can click on a player and watch pretty much every individual over the last two years.

So, if I understand it correctly, the face touching (which apparently is legal in BJJ) is just to make them flinch and lift their leg slightly. Very crafty, and excellent timing!  Edit: Nevermind, I just realized it's more of a yoko-gake action. I believe I've seen a picture of this throw in a sambo book somewhere?

Anyway, you could just play along with their game until they get tired of it: Remain upright, but hang onto them with your weight, preferably with one hand at their collar. It slows them down and should become very strenous for them after a while. In other words: Make it uncomfortable for them to remain bent over, while preserving your own reserves.

judo,39jx8s,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Fri Jun 12 08:12:30 2015 UTC,"Tai otoshi works well in these situations too. You don't need the same body contact as many other forward throws, and your uke will generally be putting a lot of weight forward. Also consider hiza guruma/sasae tsurikomi ashi if you're long legged.

It'll take a lot of energy out of the impact.  Btw.: After catching the leg, tori can apply/try various kinds of atemi waza himself before throwing O Uchi Gari.

The dropping elbow protects the body too. You can target their foot and it hurts. I am very used to hard strikes, am Black belt and 30 years Karateka with some limited MMA experience."

judo,39i2qq,fleischlaberl,3,Fri Jun 12 07:56:02 2015 UTC,"“I always thought that it was much better to smash down doors rather than waste time looking for the key, and through lack of calm and coolness, to fail to even find the keyhole.  When I arrived in Japan I ridiculed the Katas and of all the secrets that were supposed to be hidden there.  Previously, in Europe, both Katas that I had practiced (Nage-no and Katemo-no) had not impressed me at all. I think today that it is because they had never been correctly taught to me.  I thus thought only of smashing doors with even more power and force, to “smash best,” more and more quickly, while I saw around me innumerable quantities of keys which seemed able to open doors without damage, without deploying useless power.  It took me a good six months in Japan, of sensational and unchained brawls, alongside wise and erudite Katas, before I came, exhausted, tired, and annoyed, to a final door that was too thick for me to break down. Finally, angrily, I took the key, that had been there all along, from one of the gently smiling old masters of the Kôdôkan. And I opened the door by quite simply turning the key in the lock.  It is only since I began the study of Katas that I have possessed the keys of Judo, “the keys of the famous doors, thick or not!”  …And the ordinary public does not see anything interesting in the fact that one opens a door with a key instead of smashing it down brutally. One says: “Yes, obviously, it is too simple, everyone can do it.” Yet to smash a door seems increasingly ludicrous!”  Foreword to Yves Klein’s “Les Fondements du Judo”, originally published 1954.

They do not understand judo at all and muscle through the throws, do them at competition speed or uke jumps for it to work.  Absolutely appaling.  And please don't get me started on people who compete a lot, some of them actually believe they should have a free pass on graduation without understanding judo at all.  Many base their ""career"" on a couple of throws and think that is enough to be a black belt.  …and the immaturity in some of them…"
judo,39i2qq,fleischlaberl,2,Fri Jun 12 06:35:54 2015 UTC,"Thats all o.k. A shodan is more an advanced beginner - ""first step"" (sho dan) - than a""master"" and you cant know it all from starting. Its normal, that randori and competition is dominating the first 10 - 15 years of youth and we should not underestimate, that tested in practice (randori and shiai) has something darwinistic as a form of evolution - as nature works to a great perfection! When you are sandan or yondan, you should have some clue of Judo Theory and also o clue of didactic for teaching but up to Ni Dan be good in randori and competition. Most Theorist don't produce good Judo by teaching, Stylists sometimes lack qualities (mental and physical), which are necessary in shiai. Kata is useful to get a broader understanding for all five types of throws and for Contest, especially to throw on both sides with some skill, but its also some try of older Judoka to have authority and hierarchy. Its a pitty for them - the older ones - that it is not same as in music. In Music when you become 35  or 45 via talent, practice, expirience and understanding you are getting better and better and you are actually much better than a 20 year old and do perform at the highest level. In Judo with 40 you maybe understand much more of Judo principles and Judo in general than  the 23 year old with his 3 shiai throws and 2 combinations - but in contest you will lose within three minutes and be nowhere in rankings. This is some reason for humility ;-) We also should not forget, that Judo is a lot ""self taught"" in randori and practicing. Teachers/instructors are no crutches - they can help here and there, show and explain something but you have to learn Judo by yourself and to do good Judo, you have to have some talent.   The footprints are not the steps itself.   ."

Also they won't get anywhere if they just use a few throws... Only able to throw on one side? Great I'll just utilize my ashi-waza and drive them into the opposite direction. Lost against left-sided power grip? Welp guess what?  I recently wanted to do my second Dan graduation, but I decided against it because the graduation commisioner, is an absolute fucktard, who has no idea about Judo. He has a sixth Dan (how?), never had any competition results (neither in regular competition nor Kata competitions), but teaches Kata. He taught us some tate-shiho-katame escapes, for the rensa-no-kata, that made it very hard for me not to laugh. If I can't do these escapes on a mediocre-talented kid, who is 50lb lighter than me, than they are absolutely horrible. I could escape that pin with a bench-press type of motion! My competition approved escape, on the other hand, was labelled ""unrealistic"" by him. The best part, however, was, when he showed a video of two Japanese masters performing the katame-no-kata and criticized them 24/7. That's rich coming from somebody who doesn't manage to land on his stomach three consecutive times after a kata Uchi-mata.   If it were possible to do my graduation in a different state, I would, but I'd need his approval to do that. And he doesn't grant the permission because he doesn't know how the quality is over there... The responsible person is a multipe national kata champion and his assistant is a 7th Dan. Yeah, I'm sure they are horrible, because you wouldn't get any money for your shitty training camp.   Well, that rant was off topic, but the way you stop reminded me of that person.

In particular in JJ our katas are mostly weapons based but we do some judo kata too and in karate we do the Heian, Tekki and Bassai Dai katas as well as weapons and some soft forms. By we I natural mean my particular schools. I think Kata helps most of all with the stages of mastery: shuhari. I notice as I become more senior I focus more on kata than drilling a throw or strike or combination because I understand more of the move to then. My philosophy is roughly this: If you want to get strong at doing O'Goshi then drill it, if you want to get good at it practice kata, if you want to mastery it then do both."

But kata has elements to it normal drilling does not such as the cultivation spirit and understanding of the martial art or particular moves, as well as bunkai. These things separate it from the other form of drilling where it is largely about training the physical."

I guess that element exists in Judo kata but it's obtained through performing the technique, rather than sought out directly."

Kano, however,    gave beginners a short description of the technique and then had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). - Wiki.   As for    demonstrating the situation you should use that technique in   that is where your mistake lies! Kata is not a dance. It is not a scene. Kata is about perfecting and understanding, not just doing.

Judo has everything, IMO:   It's definitely pragmatic as a non-combatant civilian.  It's probably one of the few styles where you can get someone on the ground while you are standing, without doing any serious harm; if there is a need, you can go there, but it's not necessary.  Can't say that about Thai Boxing. Approaching from an MMA perspective, it can very easily transition to BJJ or standup. It's an competitive sport from the Olympics down to the regional level so athletes can train to compete if they're not interested in fighting. It's an honest-to-goodness workout for people just to stay in shape.  As you train ""live"" each time. And the most pragmatic thing of all, you learn how to fall!

As I matured I became increasingly aware and frustrated at the lack of grappling knowledge I had. When I looked into Judo I immediately fell in love with its throws and techniques. Something about it is just beautiful.   I quit TKD to focus on my studies. Fast forward 6 years; I finally have the time and money to get back into martial arts. After all this time I finally get to try Judo. I've done 10 classes so far and it's been amazing; it's everything I expected and more. It brings me so much joy."

Though it was an aikido dojo, the sensei there incorporated lots of grappling and strikes, and judo-style grappling randori with full resistance.  Since then I've moved a few times and found new aikido dojos, I've always been disappointed that the aikido at my first dojo was not 'standard' aikido, and I've never found another aikido dojo with training like that.  Finally I decided that I wasn't going to get the kind of training I want so long as I limited myself to only aikido, so I went an started judo at a local dojo."
judo,39e58o,Judostu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:23:27 2015 UTC,"That is kind of like where I train Judo. We do MUCH more jiu jitsu than any other judo club in the area, and in fact we are an affiliate of Professor Roy Dean. So I know if I ever move, I will most likely have to split my time at 2 dojo's to train these 2 arts.   Not to mention my Judo instructor taking the time to teach me a couple other arts outside of class along my journey"
judo,39e58o,Judostu,2,Thu Jun 11 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"I started twice.  When I was a little kid, my parents thought I should do sports (they were right about that). At first I did gymnastics, which I totally sucked at and I didn't like it. Then one day my father took me to a sports event held by a local club, where various kinds of sport were displayed and for some reason I decided to take up Judo. Maybe because my father had practiced Judo in his own childhood.  It was terrible. I sucked at it, every other kid seemed to be better/stronger than me. Some of the kids even bullied me. I had no fun doing it, I was afraid of falling and the lack of success at the tournaments I had to attend once or twice a month -often on sunday mornings- constantly reminded me, what a loser I was. But while I am neither strong, fast nor talented, I have one quality: I am no quitter. I continued for twelve years, until I started studying at the university.  Years later I joined a club close to where I lived. I wanted to get back in shape, and started doing western self defense jujutsu. It contained a lot of judo techniques and my old, rusty skills came in handy. As soon as I felt ready, I began training judo as well. It was not the best place to do so, that's a story I've told here before, but at least I got going again.  As a kid I probably wanted to learn how to fight when I started and didn't quit because it's not the thing I do.  As an adult I wanted to get in shape and ... well... wanted to learn how to fight as well. Judo has totally gripped me now. The reason I like it so much is, that it is so much more interesting than other forms of physical education. The techniques are complex and not only physically challenging, but also intellectually. That's also the reason why after cross training in various other martial arts I stuck with Sambo and BJJ, Judo's most closely related styles."

Did it a dozen times, not knowing, that the Judo instructor looked at me from a distance. He asked me, when I did Judo and if I want to train again. I said ""no"". He said ""do it"". I said, I have no ""kimono"". He said, ""I buy you one"". I said, that I have no time. He said: ""Give it a try - you don't have to pay"".

judo,39d2er,Judothrowaway11,5,Wed Jun 10 23:15:19 2015 UTC,"I am not sure he's afraid of competition. He let's others ""win"" all the time in randori as you say.  Anyway, most people in the West do not understand randori. Randori is not supposed to be a fight or contest. It is supposed to be non stationary, dynamic, technical practice, that can be done at various degrees of intensity. It can be done like a contest, but usually it is supposed to be a playful game of throwing and let yourself being thrown.  The problem is, that many judoists don't know that or have problems letting go of their ego when it comes to let themselves being thrown by a partner in randori. Your son doesn't seem to have that problem.  Maybe changing his perspectivity regarding the purpose of randori will help. It's to improve his technique and his partner's. For each throw he allows his partner to execute he should try one himself. It's just a fair give and take. Make him also understand, that he helps his partners learn to evade throws if he attacks. What I am saying is, that randori is about learning from each other and not about winning. Once he understands that and is able to communicate this idea to his partners (""we are not doing this to find out who is the better judoka, but to become better judoka both, let's play""), he will have less problems with attacking.  Other than that... as long as he has fun taking part in Judo, let him go about it the way he likes."

And double cool for asking this question.   Have you thought about cross-posting in r/relationships or something like that? I'm not sure how big the population of parents is on r/judo so it might be beneficial to cast a wider net elsewhere. Just dumb down the judo lingo!
judo,39d2er,staticfocus,2,Thu Jun 11 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"As an assistant coach for the kids class at the dojo where I train, I have seen this many times. For some students, they are not in it for competition. They enjoy the friends and good times to be had. Others just have not developed that side of themselves yet. Obviously there is nothing wrong with that. I have found over the last couple years that pushing them in randori and letting them know when the throw is available to them helps a lot. Then, when they finally execute, even if it is just an attempt, I get super pumped for them and give them ""there ya go!"" ""Good job!"" Etc etc.  This let's them know that we are very happy about what they are doing and that they are doing it right. Even if it's just repeating to them ""Osoto!"" Over and over when their partner moves their right leg forward or ""Go, go, go!"" When they get their grip.   You definitely have the right idea when it comes to not forcing randori or competion on him, just take it slow and see how he develops. Push him a little here and there to see if he will attack, even something as small as sticking his leg out half attempting an Osoto or Kouchi or something of the sort."

judo,39d2er,fintip,0,Thu Jun 11 11:14:09 2015 UTC,"No, it was a terribly written and hypocritical response. There are two levels of honesty, one is blunt and rude, the other is tactful. Yours was the former.   Blunt != rude. It can. But there are three levels, not two, of honest. Negative, Neutral, and Nice. Your inability to handle anything that isn't sugarcoated 'nice' isn't my problem. Really. I'm not going to modify everything I say to make people like you feel comfortable. I do neutral. And even that is a courtesy; honesty is kindness enough.   I'm actually a very skilled writer (though I'm sure you perceive anyone who is willing to express an honest awareness of their talents as arrogant by default... sigh). That has nothing to do with what occurred here. I simply refuse to expend effort making sure people aren't hurt at every turn by their inability to deal with reality.   If someone gets emotionally affected by being told, 'hey, I didn't read what you wrote because you didn't you paragraph breaks, fyi', the problem is theirs, not mine.  I can handle you just fine. You're the one who has their panties in a wad. I'm still writing calmly and unaffected, you're the one in a huff and slinging insults. Kind of baffling, actually, why you're so upset."

judo,399ef3,dz2048,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:45:24 2015 UTC,It depends what you like. Fuji is known for a lax very comfortable gi. Mizuno is a bit tougher and will last forever.   I just bought an addidas one that I'm real happy with
judo,399ef3,bigbaze2012,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:17:23 2015 UTC,"FuJi gets a lot of my family's business because they are affordable and comfortable. But anyone competing seriously should have a nice white double weave, mizuno is excellent."

judo,399ef3,PoachedEggsOnToast,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:48:16 2015 UTC,Bruises are nearly unavoidable in Judo. You'll get somewhat used to them. It also depends on who you practice with and how experienced/technically versed they are. Beginners trying sweeps will kick you in the shins all the time.

judo,399ef3,emington,2,Wed Jun 10 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"As a whitebelt? Sure; stop doing them. They're just too easy to screw up when you're still learning the basic variants of the throws. I know it seems easier to wind and throw, but there's a whole art to it (that is impossible to describe via text) to doing these throws and simultaneously keeping your uke in one piece."
judo,399ef3,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on how advanced you are. If you still struggle with most standing throws, practicing sacrifice throws is not a good idea."
judo,399ef3,emington,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"How can I ensure I don't have my back taken when I do a drop knee ippon seio nage - is there a particular way to drive once the throw is completed? I successfully did the throw in a BJJ competition this weekend, but I heard someone coach 'roll,' so I did, and obviously had my back taken. Did I roll incorrectly or is there something else I should have done?"
judo,399ef3,silvaphysh13,3,Wed Jun 10 14:47:29 2015 UTC,"Focus on angling your knees about 45 degrees away from the direction of the throw. This will make uke roll diagonally across your back through a big hole in space, as opposed to over the top of you where jigotai is more easily achieved."
judo,399ef3,emington,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:50:07 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm just wondering - When should I angle my knees? As I'm dropping after I complete the full footwork? Would uke still fall in front of me or more to the side?
judo,399ef3,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"You should endeavor to land with your knees (and therefor your hips and shoulders) already angled. Also, don't forget to turn your head as you throw. Done correctly, a good drop seoi nage has an almost guruma-like dynamic to it, where uke should roll across your back."
judo,399ef3,emington,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:08:54 2015 UTC,So the angle is away from the trapped arm right? I'm going to try to practise this next judo class! :) Thank you so much!!
judo,399ef3,pk618,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's correct. Concentrate on over-angling the knees, and they'll have a tendency to twist into the correct spot on their own. Also, I have to admit, it's a little unusual for a white belt to be practicing drop-seoi, as it's a somewhat injury-inviting throw. Be careful!"
judo,399ef3,emington,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"Injury to me or to uke? The only two drop throws I do are tai otoshi and ippon seoi nage, though I generally only have success with  sutemi-waza (yoko wakare, tani otoshi, yoko sumi gaeshi) which might explain why I prefer the drop version? My instructor hasn't said there's any problems with my drop technique, and I did ask him if it's ok for me to do the drop versions... I just don't want to hurt anyone!"
judo,399ef3,Judo_Noob_PTX,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:55:59 2015 UTC,"Drop seoi tips:   master it standing, then repeat the same motions on the knees step deep, if possible behind the uke, on your entry step. This helps to disrupt balance so you are not just pulling them on your back. turn your head and shoulders. Don't go forehead to the mat, you should be pulling them over your shoulder. Follow through all the way (this is what your coach means by ""roll""). control the sleeve as high as possible. If you are trying to throw from their elbow, or god forbid wrist, you'll likely give them too much room. A good player will just sit on you and take your back."
judo,399ef3,silvaphysh13,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:03:44 2015 UTC,"Rolling along when you throw is something some Judo competitors practice to get a throw done versus greater resistance. Under common Judo rules, once your opponent has been thrown for a full point, you don't have to worry about your position after that, thus many judoka are willing to sacrifice their stance and fall down or roll along in the hope to make the throw more successful. From a martial art's point of view or from BJJ rules, rolling along, or falling into certain postions is a bad idea, since you give your opponent your back. Personally I prefer to aim for control over uke after the throw. In other words I think one should think beyond the throw."

judo,399ef3,stripelesswb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"That depends on your dojo and sensei. Generally, kyu grades in my experience test in small groups. If your sensei has some experience, they wouldn't allow you to test unless they were fairly certain you could do it without any major problems. Think of it not as an exam but as a chance to show off all the cool tricks you've learned!"
judo,399ef3,PoachedEggsOnToast,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"Relax. It's your first grading and not an exam for the 5th dan. Do your best to show what you were taught.   Also, will I be by myself or will it be in a big room with other people?   Since exam procedures vary from country to country and federation to federation it's impossible for us to predict how exactly your grading will look like. There's usually one or more examiners present, all judoka who will be tested that day, and sometimes even an audience (family and friends).  The exam may include a technical part, where you have to show basic techniques, like breakfalls, simple throws and pins. Sometimes randori or even a tournament like fight is required. If a victory is necessary depends on the federation.  If it helps you, try to assume a different mindset than ""Oh no I am being tested"", try ""okay, I'll show you how it's done"". Don't say it out alound though. It's just about the right attitude and positive thinking. Work towards a good outcome, not against a bad one. That's not a technical difference, but a psychological one."

The dojo was getting ready for a local tourney so we did a lot of randori (there was one adult green belt for me to go with).  Background: am a (sucky) BJJ blue belt who wants to improve his stand-up game. We drill doubles and singles in the dojo, and only one instructor who also happens to be a judo black belt, is teaching us simple judo throws.  Question: what should I pay attention to as a complete beginner? What are the basic things that are essential to understand? Mentally and physically.  Thanks."
judo,399ef3,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,2,Wed Jun 10 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"From what I understand in bjj a lot of the throws you will learn won't be techniques that involve you turning your back to your opponent so a throw like osoto gari won't give up the back. The reason for this I think is that with leg grabs still being in bjj it makes hip techniques a lot easier to counter. So, if you can, leave your apprehensions for turning in behind when you do judo. Turn in and fully commit rather than just sheepishly doing a half turn and hoping for the best. A tip I have from my friend who cross trains in bjj and judo is when you do randori, don't just try and take the fight to ground so you can win. Really try to use what you learn in judo when you're at judo"
judo,399ef3,silvaphysh13,2,Wed Jun 10 23:15:53 2015 UTC,"Proper breakfalls. They will not only allow you to fall without pain and injury, but also lower one's natural fear of falling. As a result you'll dare to attack more often without being afraid of being countered, which is important for your learning progress."
judo,399ef3,fleischlaberl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:19:42 2015 UTC,What's the deal with not being able to grab the legs?
judo,399ef3,twan55,3,Wed Jun 10 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that although leg-grabbing techniques are not allowed in most shiai, they are absolutely a vital part of tachi-waza as a whole. They were mainly barred from contest because they began to foster over-defensive posturing, and lots of stalling out, and reduced the dynamism of the match, as well as increasing the chance of certain injuries."
judo,399ef3,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:02:58 2015 UTC,The thing is when leg grabs were allowed were they used as much as people say? I see some older matches and competitors usually only did it to assist a throw.  Genuinely curious
judo,399ef3,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"I've by no means done an exhaustive study on the subject, but from the videos I've seen, I've noticed the same thing. Leg grabs look like they were largely supplemental or stalling tactics. I don't think they were that important, but I still don't think they should be banned.  On the subject of making Judo audience friendly, I think it's a pipe dream no matter what. Grappling sport audiences are made up of grapplers, ex grapplers, and the family and friends of grapplers. Minor rule changes aren't really going to draw in the armchair athlete fan-base."

So, kata garuma is an ippon, but Kibisu-gaeshi wouldn't be.  Allow some leg locks.    I don't know if no-gi would really be a thing to go for, but a dojo should definitely be able to include it in training if they want to.  Maybe create more competitions with Kosen rules.  Basically, Judo chase the idea of the spectacular ippon for competitions.  Something that looked exciting so it would draw spectators.  Ironically, that may be what's killing it."

Also awarding points for taking backmount.   introduce exciting team competitions   There are various rulesets for such competitions in Japan.    introduce self defense programme   That would be re-introduce self defense programme.

Okay, wait a moment... those constant IJF rule changes are actually bad, no quesition.   ""The re introduction of Kata"" hurting Judo? WTF??? Whoever wrote that, has no fucking idea, what kata are and what they are good for...  ""Keeping Judo pure"" depends on what pure means. If pure means true to the founders intentions, that means a flexible, ever improving art following the guidelines of maximum efficiency and mutual wellfare, then it is a good thing. If it means seperation, stagnation and self-isolation then it is a bad thing. Tradition is keeping the flame going, not preserving the ashes.

I remember an interview with Sambo Steve where he said the Russians often train every ruleset - Judo, Sambo, No Gi - and when competitions come near they focus on that ruleset. My dojo has some days like this, and people competing in Judo, BJJ, Wrestling, and No Gi and I love it. If people are encouraged to compete across rulesets then Judo doesn't even need to change its rules (even if I think it should), we can just train for everything from a Judo perspective and use the whole gamut of techniques."
judo,397ayd,dzendian,5,Fri Jun 12 09:20:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds silly to me.  As far as I know Judo is second most popular sport in the world, and the most popular individual sport in the world.  The rule changes make it more spectator friendly which will only make that position stronger.  If you love Judo and you want it to continue to grow, develop your own Judo into something extraordinary, create opportunities for the up-and-coming Judoka in your life to succeed, patronize Judo competitions, and encourage your friends to do all of these things."

judo,397ayd,Aratoast,2,Wed Jun 10 00:23:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It just needs to modernize for this decade. Judo the way it is now isn't very fun to take part in. The art is great. Lack of self-defense,limited attacks,grips,no legs,watered down groundwork are just hurting it. Look at MMA and BJJ the 2 fastest growing sports. Judo should offer that. No-Gi will bring in more jits/mma guys who are just looking to Crosstrain and not interested in any of the history,bowing,etc and just teach it for self-defense,grappling (Gi & no Gi,mma) It's an effective art so why limit it to the rules. Just my thought."
judo,397ayd,Carlos13th,3,Tue Jun 9 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing ""Lack of self-defense"" and I do not understand that.   Why's Judo so terrible for self-defense. Don't all Japanese police officers still learn it?"
judo,397ayd,Carlos13th,2,Wed Jun 10 04:24:57 2015 UTC,"They do, and so do other police (fun fact: kesa gatame was a standard restraint hold for the British police, up until someone died of an asthma attack or something similar - it got removed from use for being too effective...)  Judo for self defence might not be specifically taught as often as one might like, but it's arguably one of the best systems for it."
judo,397ayd,Judostu,2,Wed Jun 10 11:28:29 2015 UTC,Judo is pretty good for self defense in my mind. You have a good ability to restrain grappling ability both standing and on the ground and a use of force continuum you can use from restraining and pinning someone to hitting them with a planet.

judo,3995xg,XM16457,2,Wed Jun 10 03:55:31 2015 UTC,"For leg grabs, the reasoning was that it was making the judo too defensive. Fighters were so worried about getting their legs grabbed that they wouldn't attack. You could argue there are better ways to solve that problem, but that's the one the IJF went with.  For neck cranks, I understand it as a safety question. Neck cranks cause injuries and are mostly strength based. A good strangulation will not cause long term damage and will work even when it is a weaker person on a stronger person. That's closer to the spirit of judo than just pulling on someones neck until they can't take any more."
judo,3995xg,dermanus,2,Wed Jun 10 04:55:49 2015 UTC,"For leg grabs, the reasoning was that it was making the judo too defensive. Fighters were so worried about getting their legs grabbed that they wouldn't attack. You could argue there are better ways to solve that problem, but that's the one the IJF went with.   If Neil Adams is to be believed, part of the issue was that they were concerned that restrictions on leg grabs would just lead to people finding loop holes and the judgement of the referee needing to be too subjective - removing a bunch of techniques was seen as preferable to a world champion losing their title on a controversial ruling.  Which does make a lot of sense, even if one doesn't necessarily agree."
judo,3995xg,Aratoast,2,Wed Jun 10 11:32:22 2015 UTC,"People act as if the loss of leg grabs is a big thing that somehow neuters judo. I'm not so sure ; imho leg grabs were often code for ""run like a retard at the other guy, head down, until you bowl him over or out of bounds"".  One thing that might be interesting though is to reintroduce te-guruma. People are getting away with blue murder / simply over powering someone and without the risk of a counter. You'll note now that many players simply fall to turtle whereas before teguruma was employed (against something like osoto).   Te-kouchi gari / kibsu gaeshi use to be favored throws of mine (that and sitting down kata guruma) but I have to admit my judo has improved without them being on the table.  As for the other argument - that removing morote gari has made judoka vulnerable to double legs; I think people forget that we still know how to sprawl (and have to against a strong drop seoi).  Finally, I think leg grabs are important for no gi; whenever I teach no gi, I use them (per Rielly Bodycomb's excellent ""No kurtka"" sambo system. Get his set if you don't have them; $10 is a bargin)"
judo,3995xg,bozo78,2,Wed Jun 10 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"Since the first written Judo ruleset from 1899/1900 there have been many changes. I think all joint locks except for elbow locks have explicitly forbidden since 1925.  The reasoning behind forbidding techniques in randori and shiai was mostly a safety concern. Kawatsu Gake (entwined leg hook), Daki Age (body slam) and Kani Basami (scissor throw) are banned for safety reasons as well.  Other rules exist to enforce a certain fighting style. This is sometimes senseful, sometimes less so. Kano was no friend of a too much ne waza (ground technique) in tournaments, since it he feared judoka would negelect their standing game.  Some newer changes by the IJF aim to make Judo more attractive for audiences though, which is a reason no martial artist can take seriously.   For more information here's an (somewhat older) article by Syd Hoare:  http://www.judo-snijders.nl/download-judo/DEVELOPMENT%20OF%20JUDO%20COMPETITION%20RULES.pdf  Hoare suggests a leg grab ban here, seems he got his will... one of the things I disagree with him in."
judo,3995xg,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Wed Jun 10 07:17:17 2015 UTC,"I suppose I can see the argument against mae hadaka jime (guillotine)...but the rule against omoplatas (ashi garami?) makes no sense to me.  Also...rule against touching the face. If a guy hides his chin, surely it's more humane to gently lift his forehead and apply hadaka than to try to knuckle him.  Grip restriction rules: these I get. There are certain grips that can be held onto (passively) for ever and a day...and without the threat of leg grab counter, would lead to stalling"
judo,3995xg,bozo78,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"There are two techniques that people refer to by ashi garami in Judo. Officially it's a leg lock, where tori wraps his leg around uke's leg and pushes his foot inwards towards uke's stomach. This locks uke's knee from the side, similar to a heel hook. It's the last technique in the Katame no Kata. The omoplata would be the other one. The problem is, that Judo rules don't ban specific techniques, but ban attacking certain targets or in certain patterns instead. Attacking the shoulder joint is forbidden and thus omoplatas are not allowed.  Touching the face might be the same problem. While some ways to touch it are quite harmless, I can think of other ways I wouldn't want to experience in randori or shiai..."
judo,3995xg,Geschichtenerzaehler,4,Wed Jun 10 21:24:50 2015 UTC,"The argument I have heard was that at high levels of competition, people were stalling by grabbing the leg, which resulted in negative judo and a lot of matches won by penalty or small score.  The IJF tried at first banning grabbing the material of the pants, then when it continued banned direct leg attacks allowing only counters or follow-ups.  Those rules proved difficult to adjudicate so they went to the all-out ban.  They were not apparently all that concerned about wrestlers double-legging the shit out of judoka as that doesn't happen much, it was more about promoting ""ippon"" judo, positive judo.  A lot of us felt they threw the baby out with the bathwater on this one, if the guy is playing negative judo we have penalties for that already, they should just be enforced.  There are no other restrictions on grips, just that if you take an unconventional grip you have to attack right away.  This did come out of the Russians and others stifling their opponent with one-sided grips.  Attacks to the mask of the face and cranks have been illegal as long as I can recall, for safety reasons."

judo,3995xg,pk618,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:48:34 2015 UTC,"I would tend to disagree with that. Kano himself introduced kata guruma from wrestling because of its effectiveness. There are many wrestling techniques that I would argue meet the ""maximum efficiency minimum effort"" spirit of judo, as well as ""mutual benefit and wellfare"". If the mythology is to be believed Judo was all about finding safe, efficient, effective techniques and training them in an alive manner. Leg grab attacks are part of that. Dangerous attacks on the other hand (Kani basami, neck cranks, etc) don't meet the standard as readily."

However, this can also be achieved by going to national and international training camps or just visiting other dojos, which is btw a good preperation for competitions. Frequently, I get friends with people with whom I head good fights at competitions. Fighting under conditions where both fighters absolutely want to win.  Getting used to official matches with a referee and a set time. Losing. I accept my losses, but whenever I loose at competitions, it motivates me to train harder. It's the best motivation of all.   And most importantly, it's fun. I just love fighting. I am no aggressive person at all, I have never been involved in a street fight, but in Judo, I love fighting and competing. Even if it is against stronger people, then I try to be smart, maybe I can find a way. Those who are afraid of fighting should ask themselves if Judo is the right sport for them.

judo,3936vd,newhoza,2,Tue Jun 9 02:50:52 2015 UTC,"A (by IJF rules forbidden) ""pocket grip"" is something completely different. Mr. Sharp means an ""double armpit grip"". The advantage of tis grip is, that you are controlling the upper body and the head of your opponent very well, disadvantage is, that you have not such a good leverage like with a standard grip (lapel and sleeve). With this ""double pocket grip"" you are very near to your opponent and  you have to have a good feeling for balance and maybe you also have to have some power. As the distance to your opponent is close, you can block and counter very quickly and also turning in for a throw very fast on both sides, because you don't have to change the grip. Wim Ruska (double olympic champion 1972) and Angelo Parisi (one of the most gifted and technical Heavy Weight  Judoka ever) used this grip.  ."

Unless I stop the power-hand, they can throw me easily. I learned it from watching Koga's 'New wind' or something like that. He used it to great success as well :)  There is a legal way of doing the 'pocket grip'. When the IJF defines pocket grip they mean where you grab the end of the sleeve, and fold it backwards, partially the fingers are inside the gi. If the gi is twisted, this can pose some safety issues for uke's wrist and negative judo. The legal way is done in the same way, but above the edge of the gi, like 5 cm above the sleeve end, fold and press down. Very effective :)"

judo,38yduf,H2Outbreak,7,Sun Jun 7 22:08:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, it takes like five years just to get the base work down.  When will people on this subreddit realize that judo is one of the most difficult sports there is, and that it takes years of practice, not just a year with two classes a week."
judo,38yduf,13FiSTer,7,Mon Jun 8 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"It's probably another two or three years before you get a bit of a real feel for things. Maybe less or maybe more depending on how often you train.   That's my personal experience, yours could be totally different."
judo,38yduf,Kosoto_Gake,9,Sun Jun 7 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"Most of the time when I was learning, it was a constant plateau. I would progress a bit and they stay there or regress for months on end.  The times I did progress were times when I unexpectedly whipped out a beautiful throw. I would focus on the feeling of that throw for a while and try to feel it again. I asked everyone for advice, or asking them for feedback on how I was throwing them or mechanics or something.  Give it time, and find your sweet spot on one or two throws. I feel that while you get better at one technique, you also get better at judo theory, and the next one comes to you a little quicker.   The biggest thing is to remember that it is a journey, and not to be too hard on yourself. If it were easy, everybody would be a black belt."
judo,38yduf,SonicEuthanasia,2,Mon Jun 8 00:30:23 2015 UTC,"Replying to myself because I'm on mobile and can't edit:  Getting thrown or submitted isn't just practice for your partner.

judo,38yduf,user079,5,Mon Jun 8 07:41:55 2015 UTC,"It's not going to happen over night. It ask comes with practice. One thing I would suggest is taking a page out of bjj and flow train. Get a partner and do randori but don't go at full speed. Keep it light, move your partner and let them move you. Throw your partner and let them throw you. Stay relaxed the whole time, but otherwise treat it like any other round of randori. This will let you practice seeing opportunities and setting up throws. In all of my martial arts experience (in both striking and grappling) I have found this kind of practice to be the most helpful for learning."
judo,38yduf,flowgod,3,Mon Jun 8 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"What you're asking about are some of the hardest, most important things in Judo.  Don't give up the grip fighting and if your posture is broken, make your only priority improving your posture. Study grip fighting.  Learning to 'sense the opportunities' takes forever. I still feel like a blundering idiot who can only every throw people because they're even worse blundering idiots. When I get a great throw on a difficult opponent, once every month or two probably, it leaves me with quite a high.  It just takes a long, long time. You have to do it so much that your subconscious notices the opportunities faster than you can consciously think.   As for telegraphing, maybe focus on conscious misdirection. Maybe film yourself to watch your own telegraphing, learn what your tells are, and learn to stop doing them. Relax before your throws.  Judo is hard. It's one of the most frustrating things I've ever done.  Good luck."
judo,38yduf,fintip,2,Mon Jun 8 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"I am finding it helps to try practicing throws as slowly as possible.. Like if you've ever played guitar, trying to switch chords.  Though this process can be so boring and I feel like I need the randori to keep me into the fun of judo."
judo,38yduf,GrandMasterofFlowers,2,Mon Jun 8 00:32:01 2015 UTC,"I normally tell my students remember where you started. At one point not too long ago you couldn't even fall properly. It will take a while to become proficient and throw with ease, but if a new white belt was to walk in the room tomorrow and train only with you, they would be raving about the ease with which you throw them.  It takes time to become proficient, but I would advise practicing combinations (if x fails then y opens up), rather than just one throw. Also, a lot of lower belts tend to tense up before throwing, so try to remain loose (especially with your grip)."
judo,38yduf,Da_Real_M-V-P,2,Mon Jun 8 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"You have no style.  You are a newb.  I don't say that mockingly.  I say that so you can stop thinking that a year is a long time to have done Judo.  That isn't even enough time to learn all the basic throws competently with a compliant partner, much less a resisting partner.  You can't assert your will on people with much more experience than you any time soon.  You will sense opportunities by practicing.  Practice practice practice.  The bad news is there is always a long way to go because Judo is hard.  The good news is, all you need to do is keep at it, and you will get better at Judo.  Any more specific advice would have to come from your Sensei.  Although, in my opinion, the brown and black belts should be helping you and not just showing how much they can throw a white belt."
judo,38yduf,dzendian,2,Mon Jun 8 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"Randori is where you work on your technique.  You don't go there to win.  You don't lose in randori.  You learn from it.  Stop trying to use strength; scale the technique up to 75% and the strength up to max 25%.  You should keep it loose and relaxed until you start your kuzushi.  If it feels like an arm wrestling match, it doesn't sound right to me.  Next time, actively try to loosen up.  Are you afraid of being thrown?  Is that why you're tensing up?  Is tensing up why you're telegraphing?  Stand up straight.  Work on your tai sabaki.  Maybe sit out every other match and watch the brown belts and black belts go at it.  Watch how they move.  Maybe even try to imitate it.  During this process, as you adjust, you will probably be thrown more, but you'll also throw more.  If you can, during uchi komis, try to do moving ones and try to do ones you're not good at, because this will also help you in randori.  If you do nage komi, see if you and your partner can do them while moving around."
judo,38yduf,fedornuthugger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"You're probably really stiff. Being very stiff makes you telegraph and most newer belts make this mistake. That being said, it's hard to relax when you're new to Judo. For now, try to relax in Randori and try to feel the kuzushi. Also don't worry about being thrown - just use it as an opportunity to employ those breakfalls you have practiced. Making sure you breakfall properly will give you confidence when others attack and counter you."
judo,38yduf,chchma,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"When some beginners start underneath you, you might get to throw them. While training with higher level judoka increases your abilities it can dash your confidence in your progress. Actually remember what you were like in your first week and check your progress from that. You will be getting better but rarely notice it because your club mates are also improving at the same time, like two trains travelling alongside each other at similar speeds. Gambatte kudasai."

What do you know about kuzushi? Grip fighting? How often do you do randori? Nagekomi? I know you're probably looking for a sympathetic ear but the old saying is sadly true: 1 year for good newaza, 10 years for good tachiwaza. So, 2023 is about when you should be able to consistently and easily ""assert your will"". Of course, you'll start to get tantalizing glimpses along the way as you train in the next weeks, months, years but effortless throws against shodans are a ways away yet. That doesn't mean you can't love every minute of the journey though - judo is very deep and very rich."
judo,38yduf,Anthropolygon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:45:11 2015 UTC,"my practice has been sporadic over three years. I train when time and money allow. At some point I just stopped caring about being ""good"" at judo. I resigned myself to getting my ass kicked every single practice. Like, ""I am paying money to get my ass kicked"" was the realization I had. Then judo became more about self-preservation, and incremental progress. Like I realized that my ukemi is better than it was, and better than people who first start out. My posture is better. I am more relaxed, my stiff-armed ""spaz"" mode is receding. Can I reliably execute techniques? not at all. but some aspects of the sport are getting better. To date I have executed one successful technique, on one whitebelt, once. One ""judo moment"" in three years of on-again, off-again training. Is normal."

judo,38waev,Ryvai,2,Sun Jun 7 23:44:15 2015 UTC,"Because nobody puts translations of anything on their belt in Japan, at least not in the customary sense.  Your name and the school/club/person you are representing, and that's it.  I am sure you can find exceptions to that rule, but I have never seen it.  And weird translations of the Japanese language are kinda what gaijin do...and that goes for belts, tattoos, shirts, song lyrics, etc.    Again, they wouldn't think you're being rude for putting whatever you want - especially if you're not Japanese.  But if it's other than your name/school and some kind of weird translation, it is a safe assumption that you requested it on your own because it more than likely would not have been obliged here."

I've been in this exact predicament in competition as the blue gi. There's really nowhere for him to go except fall back and hope to roll it into an ura-nage. I think it's on white to land ontop and maintain control to be awarded ippon, so would probably like to see wazari for this. I don't think blue should get awarded anything, his best case is doing exactly what he did which is basically displaying white's lack of control of the throw (that ippons should have).  When it happened to me, I (blue) pivoted more sideways and landed on top into a pin and got ippon...I hated it because I knew I didn't deserve it."

The arguments in the comments that say ""well white put his foot on the mat"" don't help the case, it doesn't alter the trajectory of the fall. It is a failed attack on blue's part, white was just along for the ride. Blue left his other standing foot on his own accord, he jumped in order to try to get the extra rotation.  Also, why are you asking other people's opinions when you're just going to reply with ""well in my experience, you're wrong because I know how to do this perfectly.""

judo,38r66w,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:15:18 2015 UTC,"I know you are on a crusade and everything, but you might want to read this.  Now look at the video again, she clearly breaks the opponents balance by dropping to both knees, but she throws by extending her legs forwards/upwards; therefore pulling/lifting her opponent over. For me that's just a modern drop seoi. Sure the throw contains elements of both a seoi-otoshi and a seoi-nage and it's up to the player which one is more prevalent.  If you look at drop seois you will basically see two types. One version where Tori throws with parallel knees and doesn't get back up as much. The second version is the one from the video, with one leg being tilted on the mat and Tori then jumps back up; mostly it tends to be more of a running down though. An example from Kuziutina in Rabat as opposed to Takaichi in Rabat   Lastly let me ask you one question: Is it really necessary to differentiate between the two? Drop seoi specialists train a standing seoi nage and not a standing seoi otoshi, so does it really matter? You are not going to do a drop seoi in Kata anyway."
judo,38r66w,PartyPope,3,Tue Jun 9 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"I am aware, that it is Seoi Nage, when tori rises again from his knees before he throws uke (did you read my article completely and watch the Kodokan samples?), but here it looks like uke's already down  when she rises again.  The Kuziutina sample is really borderline, but it seems she didn't get fully back on her feet... tough call.  If it matters? From a practical point of view, very little. No one needs to know what those throws are called to execute them effectively. The reasons why I tend to point them out are (a) just for correctness's sake (b) for some understanding the mechanical principle makes it easier to learn a technique. The different names indicate different principles."
judo,38r66w,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yes I did watch the video; however, there are multiple issues: it's dated and theoretical. Most modern drop seois are seoi-nages and not seoi-otoshis, it's just a lot harder to actually lift somebody during competitions.  I know this from experience, because I have used that throw for 15 or more years, but don't take my word for it. Instead compare Nomura's seoi in Training and competition. When he hits it perfectly in a competition there is a lift, but usually it's just a sprint. Even while ""sprinting"" he sometimes gets back to his feet completely during the throw. The same type of sprint that you can see from Nishida.  Now why do I think it is actually worse to call it a seoi-otoshi? It encourages you to stay down. One downwards motion, boom. That is not only way worse for your knees, but also subpar. Sure it is easier to execute a seoi-otoshi, but once you reach a certain level of competition it will be really hard to throw somebody with seoi-otoshi, especially in the lighter divisions. For heavyweights, however it is even harder to get back up and actually lift the opponent. Still they train seoi-nage during practice.   (b) for some understanding the mechanical principle makes it easier to learn a technique.   In my humble opinion, you should focus on learning drop seoi-nage or just use seoi-otoshi as a ""surprise""/supplemental technique."
judo,38r66w,PartyPope,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:27:04 2015 UTC,"How bad Seoi Otoshi actually is for the knees or not, there was some paper going around here somewhere,... if I recall correctly it is not that bad if done correctly.  Anyway. What I see in some of these competition competition samples is this: Tori drops down, pulls uke down and then rises to give uke some additional push to roll over on his back. In other words the core mechanic of seoi otoshi already did its work (uke fell), improperly though, and tori gives uke an additional nudge be rising from his knees.  In a seoi nage with knees temporarily touching the ground, uke does not fall before uke rises from his knees... Thus I'd call the some competition samples Seoi Otoshi. It's a borderline thing in some cases though.  I agree with you though, that dropping techniques and sutemi waza are something one should not practice before one has a certain skill at stading techniques. Techniques where tori sacrifices his stance should be a last resort option."

judo,38l4gi,Sirkkus,5,Thu Jun 4 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"We see the same kind of thing in BJJ (people feel like competitors go for points instead of the finish), and various proposals to fix the problem. One thing that seems to be going pretty well is competitions without points or decisions at all: Metamoris has rounds that last 20 minutes and if there's no finish, it's a draw. For EBI, if there's no finish they do this interesting overtime thing where they alternately put one or the other competitor in advantageous positions. I don't think either format would work in a big tournament with lots of competitors.   Thing is, regarding your proposal: The judge's decision is a form of tie breaking. The decision is going to have to be based on some kind of criteria, and I don't see any reason those criteria wouldn't be just as exploitable (if that's how you see it) as yukos."
judo,38l4gi,sasquatch007,4,Fri Jun 5 02:24:44 2015 UTC,"I think Metamoris is shaping up to be a failed experiment. EBI's method of tiebreaking seems to be working better, and their general format.  Good point about the judge's decision still being a form of tiebreaking.   I'd like to see a competition experiment with OP's rules. I'm all about removing perverse incentives to half ass things. I'm not sure that competitors aren't already going for the ippon as much as they're able to, though. They still want the ippon. It's just hard."
judo,38l4gi,fintip,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the judges decision is definitely a tie-breaking mechanism; unless you allow the matches to go on indefinitely you will always need to have some form of that (although I guess you could just declare it a draw as you mentioned... maybe you could design a tournament in which wins are worth 3 points, draws worth 1 point or some such thing... something to think about).   I do think that a decision is a lot harder to exploit than yukos or shidos, because a judge has the ability to detect blatant exploitation and account for it in their decision."

You read about those old fights that lasted without rounds for hours.   Obviously it is unfeasible to have a tournament in a few days with that format, but 5 minutes is just too short for elite level competition to be fighting for.

From this point of view its natural to stand competitors up when the continuation has ended. Personally I prefer standup so this works quite well for me."
judo,38l4gi,trumfnator,-2,Fri Jun 5 14:24:16 2015 UTC,I think you have totally misunderstood the purpose of judo alltogether.
judo,38l4gi,OceanRacoon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:31:08 2015 UTC,"Rules-wise, this is a lot more akin to the old-school judo contest rules before anyone had the idea of pleasing the spectator."
judo,38l4gi,user079,2,Fri Jun 5 09:37:17 2015 UTC,"The people who keep maiming judo to become more viewer-friendly are fucking delusional.  Judo is not, and never will be a popular spectator sport. I don't know a single non-judoka who can stay awake through more than 10 minutes of judo bouts on tv. The fact is, watching two guys grapple is boring as hell, and that's exactly why boxing evolved away from holds and throws.   In fact, I doubt that adding arcane rules and stopping the action every 20 seconds is doing much to boost viewership in the first place."
judo,38i27y,tranypanda,22,Thu Jun 4 10:33:05 2015 UTC,"Japanese is essentially an accepted ""lingua franca"" for Judo; since EVERY Judoka learns the Japanese terms, regardless of nationality and mother tongue, they can understand and communicate with every other Judoka. If you had a Bulgarian, Frenchmen, Japanese, Egyptian and Englishman together in a dojo, and said that you wanted to drill O Soto Gari, every one of those people would nod and start drilling O Soto Gari. If you wanted to drill 'Ezekiel chokes' or 'lockdown' or 'donkey guard' you'd spend all day translating that into each language.  Judo naming conventions are also pretty precise and logical, so someone learning can build upon previous knowledge once they have the terminology down... the instructions are in the name. O Soto Gari- big outside reap, Ko soto gari- small outside reap, harai goshi- sweeping hip, etc. Nothing in the name of the  ""jap whizzer"" or ""jailbreak"" really explains how to do them."
judo,38i27y,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,4,Thu Jun 4 13:37:40 2015 UTC,This not true at least for Korea where every Korean coaches uses exclusively Korean terms for all Judo techniques to teach Judo.

judo,38i27y,kspirit,2,Fri Jun 5 22:36:07 2015 UTC,KKA doesn't do that anymore but other Korean martial arts do. Hae Dong Gumdo is one where the founders actually got taken to court over their lies.
judo,38i27y,JoeDwarf,2,Fri Jun 5 23:44:52 2015 UTC,"Well, historical beefs aside, I think my point still stands. We get a lot of international students and competitors coming through our dojo, AND I'm in a bilingual city. Even the people who can barely understand each other can easily communicate when it comes to Judo.  It's a logical, precise and international naming system. There's not much bad about it."

judo,38i27y,fleischlaberl,8,Fri Jun 5 01:33:08 2015 UTC,I think it has more to do that the attitude in BJJ is that if you invented a move or guard style then you have naming rights.   BJJ at this point doesn't have an authoritarian central body like Judo does either that can enforce a global naming standard.
judo,38i27y,truthjusticeUSAway,14,Thu Jun 4 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"Judo is still a Japanese martial art, and the Japanese are pretty adamant about tradition and purity and all that. Brazilians took a Japanese martial art and specifically did away with the idea of tradition in exchange for effectiveness, and in doing so also brought in influences from other grappling arts. That's where the non-Portuguese and Japanese names come from. It's not seen as a big deal in BJJ to call a kimura a double wrist lock, or an Americana a key lock, or either their equivalent proper name from Judo. It all describes the same thing, so it doesn't matter, whereas in Judo it seems that being educated on the tradition and naming conventions is part of training. In BJJ, I've had black belts teach me maneuvers they just call ""that cool shoulder lock from side control"" or something, because the name is less important than the action."
judo,38i27y,Ryvai,12,Thu Jun 4 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"The advantage of a ""proper classification with general names in one language"" is like in anatomy (latin), that students, advanced and experts are all taking about the same, when they hear ""ude garami"" (and not kimura or double wrist lock).  The disadvantage is, that you are getting easily to a ""Canon of Judo"", where all is written in golden letters and nothing can be changed or developed, cause the canon was written by the saints (Mifune), god himself (Kano) or by the pope (Daigo).  ."
judo,38i27y,truthjusticeUSAway,6,Thu Jun 4 13:34:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on that. Sometimes it can be confusing in BJJ when someone uses Eddie Bravo's naming convention, or the American naming convention, or the Brazilian, or the Japanese, or all of them interchangeably, or none of them at all. On the other hand, the complexities of groundfighting could get very specific with naming conventions as an arm  bar against a turtled opponent is a different technique than an arm bar on one in your guard, but rather than just saying armbar to say ""far side armbar on a turtled opponent"" is a mouthful and ultimately less important than the submission itself. I've seen /r/judo threads devolve into ""No that's not o ichi gari that's...."" type of discussions, when we in BJJ would have just said, ""sick throw"", skipped the name discussion, and gotten to the how of it."
judo,38i27y,fintip,6,Thu Jun 4 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"I can promise you, that if you post an ezekiel-choke video on /r/BJJ and label it 'awesome rear naked choke', you would be corrected almost immediately."
judo,38i27y,truthjusticeUSAway,5,Thu Jun 4 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"True, but that's not what I'm saying. An RNC without hooks in is still an RNC in BJJ, whereas in Judo a throw with the same foot movements but a different grip often gets a different name, correct? Naming is less exact in BJJ, to the extent that my old Brazilian instructor would refer to almost any joint lock on the arm as an ""arm lock"" as often as he'd call it a kimura/americana/straight arm bar/etc."
judo,38i27y,fintip,6,Thu Jun 4 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"An Ezekiel is never an RNC, as you know. /u/Ryvai's point is valid, you would totally see people correcting that in a heartbeat. On the other hand, it would still be a fundamentally different conversation, because there is no 'depth' behind the naming conventions in BJJ, and we all know that we all have different names for things. People aren't going to argue what something is called, they'll simply mention what they themselves know it as, with a small set of agreed upon specifics that aren't up for discussion (i.e., Americana, Ezekiel, Kimura, RNC, etc.).   An RNC without hooks in is still an RNC in BJJ, whereas in Judo a throw with the same foot movements but a different grip often gets a different name, correct?   It's not quite as you say. For the most part, no, but when it is a different name, it's usually because that grip changes something meaningful about the throw, both names will be related (ippon seoi nage vs. morote seoi nage), and it will usually be following a naming convention that is predictable without having learned the name before.  The names are typically created from the body parts used and the mechanical principles involved, occasionally with more precise adjectives thrown in when necessary. As such, the name of a throw tells you something about how that throw is supposed to work--if you're doing a 'shoulder throw' off your hip, you aren't really doing the shoulder throw after all.   Precise language gives us the ability to talk deeply about meaningful differences. I used to conflate Koshi Guruma (hip wheel) with Harai Goshi (hip sweep), just because I used the grips of koshi guruma while I was doing a Harai. In reality, it turns out there was a whole second throw I didn't realize existed, with different mechanics, that I only discovered because people pointed out I wasn't doing a koshi guruma when I thought I was.  Food for thought. It's not all as pointless as it seems sometimes, though it can certainly on occasion pass the point of diminishing returns in a discussion, and I've seen that happen here."
judo,38i27y,truthjusticeUSAway,3,Thu Jun 4 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I really know very little about Judo technically, only what I've picked up through BJJ, so this is helpful. I will say that in BJJ, I've never encountered a situation where the differing names is harmful to the learning process or unable to be cleared up by context and demonstration. I still contend that the action and the motions are what are most important and that it's not a failing of BJJ to have different names for the same thing."
judo,38i27y,FloatWithTheGoat,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:05:37 2015 UTC,"I still contend that the action and the motions are what are most important and that it's not a failing of BJJ to have different names for the same thing.   I don't think anyone would argue with that. The actions and motions are always king, everything's built as a supplement to that. I'd say that it's an inconvenience, not a failing.    I will say that in BJJ, I've never encountered a situation where the differing names is harmful to the learning process or unable to be cleared up by context and demonstration.   I could think of some cases where people are doing moves terribly, horribly wrong, and the potential exists that a well named move could have helped them realize they were using the wrong mechanical principle entirely. But that's theoretical, and it's a small point, and it's usually resolved by an instructor noticing and correcting. Again, BJJ is obviously still able to be transmitted in spite of a clusterfuck of a naming system. I've trained with my current BJJ instructor for just over two years, and I still run into names he uses for things that I am surprised by. He called an Ezekiel a 'box choke' the other day, and he has insisted on calling combat base 'position 2' (from his own personal nomenclature, wherein both knees down being called 'position 1'--which, come to think of it, is a move I don't know of a proper name for).  But yeah, in the end, it's just a quirky inconvenience. Makes searching for youtube videos hard sometimes. And it lacks some of the benefits that the naming convention in Judo confers. But none of those issues are deal breakers, agreed.  edit That recent Danaher video that was on /r/bjj had him talk at length about how insistent he is on good naming convention, and how detailed thoughts lead to detailed actions. That was a great point by him..."
judo,38i27y,tedingtont,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"True, but Danaher is a teacher and philosopher of BJJ, so his specific needs with communicating and defining technique is different from most people. I think what's important from the teaching standpoint is internal cohesion to a convention for naming, and not going back and forth between calling it a rear naked choke or a Mata leon. Judo seems to seek to make the rule global, which is, ostensibly, wiser, but I've never really found a technique I'm communicating to be difficult beyond one or two clarifying questions."
judo,38i27y,miraoister,2,Fri Jun 5 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"One of my major bugbears as a coach is the vague naming in BJJ. E.g. It's annoying that RNC can be both a throat crush, or a strangle, that a darce can be a painful compression, or a strangle. And that a hook sweep can an inversion sweep or a calf extension.  It's inefficient having to explain the difference of one tech vs the other, and it's confusing. Instead of having two different techniques they mix parts of them up thinking they are the same."
judo,38i27y,truthjusticeUSAway,3,Fri Jun 5 08:21:04 2015 UTC,"There are 2 different ideas with naming in both judo and BJJ;   Naming techniques based on the principle: RNC with and without hooks has the same name due to same technique being used/Any variation of Ude(arm) Hishigi(breaking) Hiza(knee) Gatame(hold) has the same name as long as the lock is applied with the knee Each specific variation of a technique needs a different name for identification purposes: 10th planet naming every transition/ moroteseoinage is shoulder throw with 2 handed grip, ipponseoinage is shoulder throw with 1 handed grip   Different coaches/players prefer different conventions."

(I aint knocking gracey jujutsu, but in the last 15 years BJJ has attracted all sorts of shady people making money and there doesnt seem to be a clear syllabus of techniques with clear-cut phrases)"
judo,38i27y,fleischlaberl,8,Thu Jun 4 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"That sounds more like somebody who doesn't know something pretending he knows something. I would never pretend to know the difference between the two, but I will contend that what you call the techniques doesn't matter if you know the techniques. Sure, it makes them harder to discuss, but that's another issue and I don't think it's shady to not have a syllabus and a list of techniques or phrases. People start at such a broad range of aptitude, you can have some newer white belts rolling well with blue belts and others who have been training for 2 years who have trouble whenever new guys come in the door in the same gym. The needs of the one aren't met when addressing the needs of the other. I think the occurrence of shady people in BJJ is less common than you think, especially because competitions generally keep schools honest and give new students something to look for for legitimacy in instruction."
judo,38i27y,miraoister,2,Thu Jun 4 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"I suppose this is an exception to the rule, but where I learn Judo, I get taught all the throws in Afrikaans. Although to get graded, you apparently have to know the throws' Japanese names"

judo,38i27y,Ryvai,3,Thu Jun 4 14:49:36 2015 UTC,"just the way organisations/clubs write up their rules and techniques and how they pass the information on to other people, as judo comes from Japan, you will find the japanese are quite obsessed with transfering information from one to other exactly, the student doesnt interpret, the student listens, while in other cultures the sport was able to flourish in its own way and a lot of the stuffy Japanese mannerism and language gradually get left behind."
judo,38i27y,collmose,6,Thu Jun 4 19:01:31 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of it is that judo has a single founder, and he wrote a 'holy book' for the art, while BJJ has many founders and a lot of the early development was done in secrecy.

I once told a fellow Korean Judo buddy that my favorite technique us Seoi Nage and I only got a really confused look in return.    I heard a lot of different theory as to why this is the case: Tommy from Red Dragon Diaries says that it's because Judo uses a lot of Kanji which has different pronunciations in Korean.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQOK_s8LmE   I also heard this is the case because of rampant anti-Japanese sentiment that exists in Korea.  I personally don't know why and I personally don't care all that much. But I found it interesting that Korea to my knowledge so far is the only country that does not use Japanese for Judo.
judo,38i27y,aronnax512,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"Forget about the language for a second. The real difference is that Judo has a set curriculum, and BJJ does not.   The moves from the curriculum in judo have set names and we stick with the original names, which happen to be in Japanese. BJJ on the other has multiple names for the same moves and sometimes has the same name representing different moves. Moves also tend to get renamed as they go in and out of fashion. When people give the moves names themselves, they tend to use their own language."

From what I remember, he goes over the different grips you may encounter, one handed grip breaks, two handed grip breaks, the proper way to set up your grip, the strategies he suggests, etc. The video is a little dated so it's not HD quality, unless it has been updated. Jimmy Pedro, I believe is a lefty so the movements are taught from that stance. Two very minor points which shouldn't take away what you can get out of it.

Posting on reddit is the first step for proving b and c incredibly wrong, which is exactly how it should be. First rule of being a star: DON'T SHIT ON YOUR FANS.

judo,38ca3y,farkoman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:41:38 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious about this too, at the low-amateur and club level. I feel like younger guys in their 20s can rest and recover and get better and stronger at judo just doing judo, but older guys need to lift to avoid injury and mitigate the effects of aging on explosiveness.   I also have this theory that some judoka are kinda stupid strong naturally but since they haven't learned good lifting technique are deceptively weak on barbells. In other words there is real specificity to strength and lots of perfectly strong judo players simply haven't bothered to apply themselves to squatting under the bar, even if they are amazing at getting their hips under you quickly during an entry or fortressing down into shizen hontai when you try to break their posture.  I also think strength and conditioning for judo is poorly understood and pretty mysterious, so I'm pretty excited to hear about what goes on for the nationally competitive set."
judo,38ca3y,JIVEprinting,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:36:45 2015 UTC,"""Strenght in Judo"" for sure is keeping the own balance while defending and attacking with good shizentai, shintai, taisabaki, hara, kumi kata and so on but what I want to look at is pure physical strenght in the big three. As you can cheat in squat and in bench press (half way down etc.) I am most interested in deadlifts, because it is not possible to do ""half way deadlift"" (forget about the competition rules like ""lock out"" at the end ...) Yamashitas numbers in 1984: bench press 170kg, squat 185kg and deadlift 215kg with a bodyweight of 126kg, which is not this strong as a top heavyweight.   From a Swiss Judoka, who was europian champion and runner up in worldchampionship in the 90's, they say, that he couldn't barely bench press his own weight, but he was super fast and explosive and decisive  in shai:  http://www.judovision.org/european-championships/1991-european-championships-prague/65kg-eric-born-sui-jozsef-csak-hun.html  ."

Not nearly as good as smart or informed training, true, but it's what happens.  The world of sports overlaps very little with the world of intelligent planning."

judo,38ca3y,JIVEprinting,0,Fri Jun 12 07:16:40 2015 UTC,"From my experience training for maximal strength didn't help my judo as much. I reached 305/405/465  for B/S/D, and 200lbs for OHP, training purely for strength. I weighed ~195lbs. And when I went against guys with similar skill-level but who did almost no strength training, they were just as tough to fight as when I was 100lbs weaker on all those lifts. It was weird too because even though I was still really flexible, I always felt ""tight"" and slow in all my movements.  It was only when I started training for power that I noticed a huge difference. I feel a lot lighter and not as ""tight"" (i didn't understand why people said lifting makes you feel that way until recently). I still maintain a decent level of maximal strength just because I am still training with a barbell through cleans, but it's not something I really care about or aim for.  For barbell work I mostly only do power cleans (and hang complexes/variants), front squats (mostly paused), CG bench and rows. Everything else is dips, pushups and pullups (all weighted usually), and other bodyweight work almost like gymanstics. I'd do box jumps too if I could. I feel 100x better than lifting for raw strength, it's almost night and day. And the thing is, I still feel just as strong (or stronger)."

Also nice for yanking punks out of annoying turtle defense."

Right handed people are used to fight right handed people, simply because they are more common, left handed people are also used to fight right handed people for the same reason.

I'm a woman under 100lbs, and I love judo and usually have wonderful upper rank partners who try throws they're struggling with on me bc I'm light. I'm fine with that, but I almost landed on my head today when a wrestler did a combo judo/wrestling move on me, and my air falls are pretty bad.  I don't want to cause a stink because I don't think he was intentionally trying to go too hard, but I also would prefer to not work with him again until I feel better with those types of moves.

judo,38bsie,2bluebugs,2,Thu Jun 4 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"This is a safety issue and I think it is necessary to talk to him and/or your instructor. In Judo practice we must aim to throw our partner on the back in such a way he or she can do proper ukemi. If his ""new throw"", does not do that or he is not able to aim it that way, he should not do it.  Another point is, how we deal with our partner in situations of great differences in strength, weight or technique. If one has a partner in randori who one could ""destroy"", one doesn't. One should provide an appropriate challenge to the partner and allow him or her to learn. One should not show off and especially not go all out.   Wrestlers are explosive and powerful and they can do very harmful stuff, when they don't control their technique properly. Your partner needs some pointers in matters of safety."

judo,38bsie,iushiush,6,Wed Jun 3 06:06:43 2015 UTC,"We need a FAQ - ""How to deal with stiff arming?"" ;)   (diplomatic solution) Talk to your partner. None of you will get any better if he continues. (probably the best technical solution to your specific problem) You can pull yourself into a back grip step by step, by moving your grip further and further around their back, which increases the pressure on their stiff arm until it folds. Just walk backwards. He has to bent his arm to pull you back or step forward follow you. Either way, you may be able to exploit this (via Ko Uchi Gari, Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi or Hiza Guruma perhaps, maybe even Uki Otoshi). Push against the stiff arms from below against the elbow(s). This often makes the opponent bend it/them or taking off his grip. You can follow up with O Soto Gari (if be suddenly bents his elbow as a response to the pressure, immediatly pull it down to your own hips and turn about 45° for the attack) or Sode-tsuri-komi-goshi if he lets go of his grip, push his harm diagnoally across and enter with your hips. Some throws may even work at stiff arm distance, depending on the length of your and his limbs. Hiza guruma for example. Try to attack from different angles. Stiff arms are the strongest against a frontal attack. Try to attack diagonally or from 45° or even 90° angles.  Your armlock-solution is not a bad idea. Just be careful, some newbies may not be ready to deal with this properly and might get injured. For a right sided ippon-seoi-nage grip, there's this: grab the sleeve of uke's right arm at the elbow, but not at the outer side. Instead put your hand further under it until you can grab the cloth at the inside. Then pull it tightly outwards. This may bend his elbow. At the same time move your right hand over his left arm and then ""dive"" with your entire right arm and shoulder under his right arm. This has to be done with your entire body of course. It is helpful to initiate it with pushes into the opposite direction(s) first (like pushing his elbow down and inside first)."

judo,38bsie,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,2,Wed Jun 3 12:46:07 2015 UTC,"hahaha, I've tried it a few times against iron arm opponents. Due to my poor timing an technique I always mess it up and end in the floor as well, well time for some ne waza!   Side note: Me ending in the floor happens a lot during some techniques like, sorry the name eludes me, that Ippon SN when you drop your knees, I usually can throw my opponent with decent force and speed and he sometimes even lands in his back, but I end up with my face on the tatami as well. In our last semi serious competition between different beginner judo courses I won this way, was very weird: my opponent hit the mat flat on his back with a lot of force (I was a little scared, I tried to excerpt more control during throws so not to injure anyone, especially due my lack of proper technique) he was fine but a little short of breath. Thing is, I hit the side of my face (and arms) so hard on the tatami, was hilarious, I'm not sure If I hit first with my face or my opponent hit the mat with his back first, was so fast. Sensei said that I hit the mat first in a weird awkward kinda shitty self sacrifice move but it worked.   I looked like I was slapped in the left upper arm and left cheek very hard for a couple hours after that.   Me being naturally clumsy, didn't help either. I have to do a lot of visualization (as my sensei explained to me: imagine your body performing the technique, feel it, etc.) and Uchikomi in order to properly throw someone.   Other thing, is that I'm a little scared to throw white belts with force (upper belts have no problem with this and encourage to go full power on the since they know how to breakfall very well or they are very confident, or I just suck, not sure). So I tend to make them fall on their side with little force, this sometimes leds to half arsed moves, sensei spent a lot of time teaching proper Ukemi so it should be ok, it's more of a mental thing that I'm afraid to hurt someone."
judo,38bsie,anypoo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:25:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your insightful answer! I'm grateful   We talk to our partners, Sensei himself encourages this and he personally has reprimanded us because our stiffness (I too I'm a offender when I'm being surpassed by an opponent, I tend to go into negative judo -as my sensei calls it- if my opponent is noticeably better).     (probably the best technical solution to your specific problem) You can pull yourself into a back grip step by step, by moving your grip further and further around their back, which increases the pressure on their stiff arm until it folds.    This has helped tremendously I was doing this instinctively, haven't noticed it until you mentioned it. I tend to go for Koshi Guruma (my Sensei spent a lot of time teaching and correcting this technique, not sure why) or Uchi mata. My Uchi mata is very poor, I end up in the floor (more on this later).  Walking back seems to fine for me, I do this to connect Juji Gatame for example. Ko Uchi Gari I end in the floor as well (sensei said to me that there's a Ko Uchi gari variation that you drop on the tatami so is not that bad). I have a lot of troubles with Sasae's in general when I put my leg I tend to lose equilibrium, same with Hiza Guruma. Need more Uchikomi and proper form.  Didn't know about Sode-tsuri-komi-goshi  (been practicing for five months) very interesting technique when you won grip wars (hope this makes sense). Thanks. O soto Gari being the first technique taught to us is a staple of our arsenal. It almost always works wonders when performed properly. One of my partners (orange belt) won a university level tournament with almost solely well placed and sappy O soto gari (he is very tall and skinny, has legs with insane reach).  I'll try to make a conscious effor to attack from angles, very nice suggestion. This is another talking point for me, I'm always scared when practicing with White/yellow belt because I'm afraid to injure someone, so I tried to excerpt a lot of control on the techniques and make them fall on their side like I explained below to /u/M3atboy, that's what afraid me of Arm Locks, I try to do slow constant force so they know when to surrender, but still, I'm a little scared. I'll try your last suggestion, seems like a very effective way to counter the stiff arm thing. I'll try it.    Thanks again!   As for the ""ending up in the floor"" thing. When I perform certain techniques (during randori or semi serious competition) I almost always end end up hitting the floor. For example as I explained to /u/M3atboy  below, when I perform drop Ippon seoi nage (not sure if is the proper name, I'm refering to IPS when you drop your knees to the mat) I tend to hit the mat with my arms and side of my face with the tatami as my opponent is being projected above me. Same with for example, Uchi Mata, I can throw my opponent with a lot of force and speed (during semi serious competitions) but invariably I end up with my face on my opponent or the mat. Same with Uki Otoshi, when my opponent is flying forwards in the air, he seems to drag me with him and I end up in the floor. Not sure why is this, of course my technique is far from perfect but I've  practiced a lot of uchikomi and soft randori and it works ok. The problem arises when we get semi serious. I just hope is just a matter of practicing more, the side of my face will be grateful."
judo,38bsie,PoachedEggsOnToast,2,Thu Jun 4 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your insightful answer! I'm grateful   You are welcome. Please note, that some of these suggested solutions are -as usual- easier said than done. Personally I deem Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi and Hiza Guruma difficult techniques, but they are pretty useful. You may want to invest some time to improve them.   (not sure if is the proper name, I'm refering to IPS when you drop your knees to the mat) I tend to hit the mat with my arms and side of my face with the tatami as my opponent is being projected above me.   It's Seoi Otoshi then. For more information about the differences, you may want to take a look at this article: http://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/33t8hp/judo_myths_debunked_part_3_drop_knee_seoi_nage_vs/  About falling/ending on the floor when throwing: Ideally you should have so much control over a technique, that you can decide wether you want to follow/lead your opponent to the ground or remain standing. In a randori situation this can be difficult to pull off though. Uke may cling desperately to us and pull us down. Our balance may be not 100% perfect, greater forces involved etc...  I think all that helps here is more practice. Ask your instructor to correct your pose for Seoi Otoshi (that shoulder throw with both knees on the mat), practice Uchi Mata either with great emphasis on keeping your balance during and after the throw, or try to the roll over variant (I dislike that, but many competitors seem to do that)."

Does anyone have experience with these kinds of injury? How long until I can get back on the mat?  How long did it take you until you felt like you had at least a workable game plan? Or your first legitimate throw against a resisting opponent?  Also, is there anything I can read about ukemi theory to improve my understanding? Because I landed on my hand because I was trying tip understand some ukemi concept told to me by a green belt, but I obviously got that wrong."
judo,38bsie,2bluebugs,3,Wed Jun 3 11:19:21 2015 UTC,"How long until I can get back on the mat?   Only your doctor will be able to tell, but it will depend on what's actually damaged. If there's a broken bone ... many months, if there's torn ligament some months (2+), if it is ""just a bruise"" some days maybe one or two weeks...    I was trying tip understand some ukemi concept told to me by a green belt   What did he tell you?  Anyway, the key points to good ukemi are:   Exhale before you hit the ground. Otherwise your lungs will hurt. no matter how you fall, don't let your head hit the mat. This usually means: Tuck in your head! ideally land somewhat on your side. You'll find the optimal angle by assuming a comforable position when lying down slap the mats hard (as if striking it), a break of a second before the rest of your body hits the ground (or at the latest simultanously, not after). The energy of the slap will be subtracted from the kinetic energy the rest of your body will have to absorb. That's why your hand should be the first thing to hit the ground, but don't do it too early either, or you might accidently post your hand, ... never post your hand. If you have to in case of an emergency (to protect your head when being thrown improperly via Seoi Otoshi for example), do it with a bent arm, not a straight one. If the straight arm or the elbow suddenly has to take the full impact energy of you being thrown (even worse with your opponent on top), your arm, elbow or collar bone will be severely damaged. foot/leg position: don't land on your joints, don't cross your legs"

In my experience, there aren't really that many throws that dump you straight onto your back. As for proper ukemi, check with your sensei to see if they have any drills you can practice. If I may ask, what's your current level of judo experience?"
judo,38ad27,silvaphysh13,5,Tue Jun 2 23:25:41 2015 UTC,Thanks. I've been doing judo in Japan for about a month and a half. My questions are elementary because my Japanese is about as good as my ukemi.

Yes, you should land on your side. Your hand should hit slightly before you land.  Here's a good little video showing pretty much how we learnt.

judo,38bfwq,fintip,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"I've recently started hitting uchi mata in randori successfully for the first time against resisting, skilled opponents. These would be the points that I've focused on:  Bending your opponent down and to the side as you enter. Enter from a slight outer diagonal. If you're attacking with your right foot, make sure your left foot ends up very close to him. Keep the attacking leg straight and get your foot as high in the air as you can. The lower you get your head, the higher your foot can go. Don't allow your opponent to get space between the two of you; keep his upper body close to yours. Keep pulling on his outer hand all the way through the throw."

This helps open up your hips and pull your thighs apart. In terms of ne waza, I've not personally run into too much testicular trauma on the mat."

They train about 12-14 Times a week, sometimes 2 or 3 times a Day, but what is important on the weekends they do basically only tournaments or cardio training. What is quite important you need a trainer who can bring you that far, because you can train how much you want if your trainer isnt able to help you ( not offending your trainer) to get to higher level it is impossible he has to see stuff that many dont. I guess you are based in the US ? You have to get better than everybody in your weight class in the US to stand a chance and qualify for the olympics only the 20 best of each weight class get into it. Go to a lot of training camps as possible in other countries than the US not offending the US but they only got malloy marty and kayla harrison that are currently world top (300million inhabitants and they got 2 and compared to georgioa that got 6,5 milllion and more and better figherts). best go to europe for training camps for example OTC Mittersill in the beginning of the year, to get to the top you need to train with the best. For your training regarding the muscles the best thing to train are the core muscles so  stomach and back these are the important ones, the rest is not that important than these, basically you have to train all your body but especially these. You have to dedicate your life to it then it is possible, sometimes Ludwig Paischer(http://www.judobase.org/#/competitor/profile/218/basic_info + vice olympic champion from beijing) trains at our club, I know how he trains and he always gives 200% but the gaps inbetween him and the top are so thin.

I really liked him as a coach, even though he was quite horrible for lightweights, in terms of technique, and Te-guruma is forbidden now :(  I agree with most of what you say, but especially during the youth it is better to train 3-5 times a week and be concentrated during those sessions, instead of overtraining. Quellmalz for example used to train only 3 times a week, until he was 16. Also you will always reach a point where no coach in the world can improve/spot certain small details in your techniques anymore. Mistakes yes, but you can only teach ""feeling"" up to a certain point. Which technique to follow up with after a throw attempt, you have to recognize how your partner reacts, especially when it's just a small reaction.  And no coach can develop your Judo style for you. Sure he can teach you his style, but you have to adapt that stye for yourself instead of blindly copying it. I have beaten so many nationals, because they weren't able to adapt to unfamiliar situations or my unorthodox Uchi-mata counter (sort of yoko-guruma, but the movement is like a sasae/hiza). My personal hightlight was, when the national coach told the defending champion in my weight class, not to use his favorite throw."

In this video around the 41 minute https://youtu.be/7bO8rKtvDoE Jimmy Pedro describes the training schedule of USA judo team. They train 3 times a day for a majority of the week.   I'm no great thing at judo but I did make my state team and I'll tell you training for it was the hardest thing physically that I ever did. And that's only training 4 times a week.   Also like the other comment says, for the majority of the population, if you're over the age of 14-15 and are not already part of your state or national team then I'm going to say it's going to be near impossible to make the it to the Olympics. There are serious people the state team who have been training since they were 6 and still won't make the Olympic team.   However you might be that 1% who just has judo in their blood and are a genetic freak and you'll pick shit up quick. My advice (in my 1 year of judo) would be get a good coach, train more and go to every single competition you can. You'll need the experience not to mention every luck in the world if you are starting late. If you really are serious good luck man, making the Olympics is no joke, the sacrifice you have to make is crazy not to mention that judo training at that level is notorious for being one of the most gruelling in the world."

judo,38310c,miraoister,3,Mon Jun 1 14:18:09 2015 UTC,"The kind of knee support you want depends on what you've done to your knee, and how much protection you need. Post more details, and maybe someone will be able to suggest something sensible."
judo,38310c,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Mon Jun 1 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"I usually use knee pads anyway, but last week my left knee was aching a bit in the joint, its a very light pain, if I straighten the leg for example or if I have taken a nap and slept on it on a funny angle.  on friday I had a shiai and now my right knee hurts the same (mirror image, same spot on the opposite knee), Im assuming wraps or tape would help?  I havent trained since friday, no exercise since then, I thought I would rest for a week."
judo,38310c,DoorsofPerceptron,5,Mon Jun 1 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"Resting for a while sounds sensible. Maybe a wrap would help. To be honest, I'm as cagey as hell about using wraps unless they're either serious articulated joints prescribed by an actual doctor, or being used temporally to reduce swelling.  The problem with neoprene type compression socks is they provide a small amount of support that stops your knee moving in response to small shocks, but don't help at all in a large impact.   Basically, wearing one of these robs your knee of the day to day conditioning you get from doing judo, but doesn't save you from any of the large impacts that are likely to injure you. So all in all, they make it more likely for you to injure yourself.  Beyond this, the fact that you've injured both knees in exactly the same way suggests that either you have weak knees, and should be doing more conditioning (e.g. body weight squats and moving on to weighted squats) after you've healed up, or that you're doing something wrong in your technique, like a bad taniotoshi.  You might be better off talking to a physio, instead of looking for wraps."

judo,382epx,ReddJudicata,2,Mon Jun 1 14:48:41 2015 UTC,I've had great success with it in randori but I haven't been able to pull it off in competition yet. Still trying ;)
judo,382epx,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:01:15 2015 UTC,More principle thoughts on uki waza and this variation?  ;-)  .
judo,382epx,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"Well, this variation uses uke's right/left arm and exposes that back-side of the body and the oncoming kuzushi is very powerful when kashiwazaki jumps sideways. Using centripetal force uke is flung over (forwards diagonal) in the opposite direction (the weak side). It's certainly effective, but requires a great deal of practice I think :)"
judo,382epx,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"If Uki Waza is misunderstood, you think, that tori is pulling uke down and flip uke over toris leg - which it isn't ... Instead its all about tai sabaki and hara. In some throws you can identify the COG (hara) of uke very easy or you can disturbe the balance of uke with a simple concept (to bring uke on his toes ore heels etc. happo no kuzushi) . In Uki Waza the COG changes with the body movement to a vector, which is outside of uke (because tori and uke together! are a ""combined system"") and ""flows"" (uki) and can be used for tori, if he can speed up the movement and the vector (maybe trajector as I am no physicist) with maximum controll (zanshin). Thats why Kashiwazakis Uki Waza is so powerful. Its not pulling down and its not that stretched leg, its all about tai sabaki and hara. I think :)  ."
judo,382epx,Blaphtome,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:50:42 2015 UTC,"The concept of happo-no-kuzushi cannot be transferred onto uki-waza. Uke's unbalance is broken in the frontal diagonal directions, not backwards. All kuzushi is done in one 'vectorial' direction or the other, it's what direction that is that's relevant. The variation that Kashiwazaki uses is done from the oblique posture. What makes it that much more powerful is when he applies pressure towards the opposite side, creating a strong defensive reaction from uke to stay on his feet, combined with the strong downward pull from the back. A more detailed instructional on his uki-waza can seen here."
judo,382epx,bozo78,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree and did say the same - maybe my poor english was confusing. But additional I spoke about ""tori and uke as a combined system"", which doesnt make you look solely at uke, to ""disturbe/break his balance by shifting HIS cog/hara but to look at the movement of toriukeuketori and the cog, they have as a whole. Thats fascinating in many sutemi waza and thats what making good sutemi waza so difficult even for the advanced. Beginners think of sutemi waza more like dragging the opponent down with your arms, use your body weight and flip them over a leg - which it isn't. As tori  in sutemi waza you often have to go/fall in a whole/empty space and  throw from there and so give up yourself first. Thats a complete different feeling for tori as in such controlled throws like osoto gari or tsuri goshi or tai otoshi.  ."

judo,37xy09,Kosoto_Gake,2,Sun May 31 11:56:41 2015 UTC,"Is trip even a term already associated with a particular meaning in judo? i could see you arguing sweep/block, but why doesn't trip make sense? normally when you trip, the object you trip over is stationary."
judo,37xy09,judokalinker,1 point,Sun May 31 14:18:03 2015 UTC,"Well 'trip' is a pretty broad term and just tends to be a Joe Rogan way of describing any Judo throw, it's just a more technical term to describe the movement in a sasae/hize than 'trip'.  If someone said 'trip' to me I'd immediately think of an osoto otoshi rather than a sasae/hize.  Also, 'trip' to me implies that you're catching someone's foot and they're falling over it; which is not the case for sasae/hize. In a sasae/hize the idea is to stop uke from being able to step round or off the throw and tori using their upper body to guide/pull them over the blocking foot."
judo,37xy09,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just feel like trip describes blocking the someone's foot so that their upper body continues through, whether you are pulling their upper body or not.

judo,37zhyl,ReddJudicata,10,Mon Jun 1 03:34:45 2015 UTC,Sounds like you don't know it very well.   To answer your specific question the only thing you can do is pull guard or spin onto your front.
judo,37zhyl,dave_attenburz,3,Sun May 31 18:57:26 2015 UTC,"Get good at pulling guard and keeping it. That is how you protect yourself when a sacrifice throw fails. Players who are very confident in their newaza sometimes use throws like that to make the fight more likely to go to the ground; conversely, sacrifice throws are very dangerous if your newaza is not better than your opponent's, precisely because they put you on your back."
judo,37zhyl,war_lobster,3,Sun May 31 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the real answer is you don't actually know how to do tomoe nage. It isn't just ""place foot and sit"", it's a complex meeting of balance, positioning, and timing just like every other throw.  If you really want to get good at it, have your coach critique you and keep practicing it in randori. Executing a throw in randori is far different than with a compliant uke."
judo,37zhyl,pk618,7,Mon Jun 1 08:28:16 2015 UTC,Utilising ma-sutemi waza as a white belt will set your judo progress back years if you continue.  Seriously.  Some beginners' competitions won't allow ma-sutemi either.
judo,37zhyl,PoachedEggsOnToast,2,Sun May 31 19:49:01 2015 UTC,"We always had a joke at our club where if you're in trouble then pull a tomoe nage. Most of us tried it at least once and it never ever worked. We hadn't learnt to properly and even now we have its such a silly competition move I almost never see anyone land a good tomoe nage. Also at higher end competitions like the world grand prixs uke seems to have so much time to spin out that even when done perfectly, tomoe nage never scores ippon. Stay away from tomoe nage"
judo,37zhyl,fintip,1 point,Sun May 31 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"This has actually been the only move I've been able to throw at least three black belts in our club, that outweigh me significantly, with. Ever. (Once each.)  It's a very technical move that requires just the right setup. I think it usually fails because, aside from technical incompetence, it requires a very specific set of circumstances to work. But when those circumstances are right, it's impossible to stop and effortless.  Just one more piece of the puzzle to have. These days I don't focus on it as much, but it's great for whitebelts who walk in the door and are stiff as a board with bad posture."

In Judo that's a no and that's fine different rules but the one thing i always disliked about judo is the rules on leg grabs, standing fighters back up, limited groundwork time & some of the worst refs in combat sports I have seen.

judo,37oes8,iushiush,6,Fri May 29 03:20:55 2015 UTC,Ashi-guruma
judo,37oes8,Ryvai,1 point,Fri May 29 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"If I understood correctly, It's similar to Osoto gake -at least it looks to me-, but in Ashi guruma, there's no ""hook"" nor ""reaping"" component. instead you make uke roll on your leg?   Thanks a lot. I've been receiver of this technique during randori multiple times, thought was some weird osoto gari due to my inexperience. And couldn't counter or escape it.   Beautiful throw!"
judo,37oes8,Ryvai,3,Fri May 29 04:29:04 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as 'osoto-gake'.  In the throw Inoue performs, there's no hooking motion or reaping. Tori's leg blocks uke and pulls him over. It might appear that he is reaping, but he is not. He is just pressing his leg against uke, when uke starts to fall forward, the blocking leg is just pushed backwards out of physics. There's countless ways of performing ashi-guruma, but uke is pulled either forwards or sideways. In osoto-gari uke is reaped backwards or backwards diagonals.  Here's a different example of ashi-guruma with an osoto-gari feint or Alexandre Moser's video on ashi-guruma. Here's a different combination example by Suzuki.  Note: the 'hooking' motion you see is just what competitors use to close the distance. It's not relavant to the throw itself as it is performed. Most people perform osoto-gari by first hooking behind the knee to close the distance without uke retreating his leg to avoid it. It's just common practice :)"
judo,37oes8,user079,1 point,Fri May 29 07:38:34 2015 UTC,"The way his foot tries to hook the knee it most definitely does look an attempt at osoto-gake (yes, it exists) but immediately turned into ashi-guruma due to how both players were moving. Perhaps it was Inoue's intention to move straight from one to the other, or perhaps it was just one of those things that happens intentional or not, but there'd be no reason to try to hook the knee like he did if you weren't attempting or bluffing with osoto-gake."
judo,37oes8,ReddJudicata,0,Fri May 29 13:29:39 2015 UTC,It's not ashi guruma. It might have been if he hit it but he's almost certainly going for osoto. He's looking to hook the knew and turn the corner.  And osoto gake most certainly does exist although not recognized by the kodokan. http://judoinfo.com/images/nauta/osotogake.htm. it's a weird flaw in the kodokan's nomenclature scheme (like ouchi gake).
judo,37oes8,Ryvai,3,Fri May 29 11:53:37 2015 UTC,"The thing is, he hit the ashi-guruma, which makes the technique he performed just that, ashi-guruma. The claim could be made whether or not it is harai-goshi or not, but his hip is not engaged, so it is not harai-goshi. Inoue pulls him over the blocking leg. The technique that throwed uke is definitely ashi-guruma. One can not seriously think that it's in the family of 'o-soto' techniques. In all the techniques in the 'o-soto' family (eg. -gari/otoshi/guruma/makikomi) tori throws uke backwards, with the exception of some variations of osoto-makikomi.  Watch the video in slow motion how Inoue turns into the throw facing and pulling forwards almost immediatly. He is known for his devastating osoto-gari, which makes it a perfect setup for him in combination with ashi-guruma or harai-goshi, depending on how uke reacts.   I know Bill Nauta has some exotic names for techniques, like o-soto-gake, o-soto-gama or o-uchi-gake, and so on. That does not mean that it's correct to claim that they follow their own principles. The Kodokan's standpoint is that in the 'o-soto' and 'o-uchi' family of techniques there exists only gari (e.g. de-ashi-gake or o-soto-harai does not exist), with the exception of o-uchi-makikomi, which follows a sutemi-waza principle and is a whole different story. The Kodokan's curriculum is not perfect, but that does not mean we can make things up and claim it to be 'truth'. The 'o-soto-gake' which Bill Nauta claims, judging by the pictures, is within the definition of o-soto-otoshi."

judo,37oes8,Ryvai,-3,Sat May 30 01:54:48 2015 UTC,No way he's going for ashi guruma there. He's going for the side/hooking osoto. It might have turned into ashi guruma if he finished it.
judo,37oes8,ReddJudicata,5,Fri May 29 11:52:50 2015 UTC,"Please explain why you think that ashi-guruma did not cross his mind in that situation. I think we both can conclude that we are not mind-readers. Knowing what goes through his mind is impossible to know for sure. These high-level atheletes don't think too much, they act based on muscle memory and the reactions they get. If the opponent had leaned backwards, the obvious choice would be to hop in closer for o-soto-gari either backwards or sideways, but uke didn't. If uke have stepped his leg back to avoid the 'hook' (which is usually used to close the distance for o-soto-gari, one can finish with ashi-guruma or uchi-mata if he missed it completely. The options are endless. One thing is certain, he reacted and the result became ashi-guruma, and certainly not o-soto-gari, it just doesn't go in that direction. Please watch the competition example I posted above, there you can see his team-mate perform the same combination with great success :)"

The push she uses to get a counterpush sets the technique up (hando no kuzushi) and the fast, fluent entry are strong indicators for that.  She doesn't pull towards her right knee during this leftsided technique, that's why her opponent falls on his head, not his back. Him being untrained makes it worse.  I wonder about the context of this event. It doesn't seem like a random encounter between strangers. I assume they know each other. It looks like she didn't want to hurt him this much.

judo,37lod5,silvaphysh13,7,Thu May 28 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. If you study older Kodokan documentation, there's tons of work done on atemi-waza and leg locks. Just because they're not part of modern, competitive judo does not mean they're non-existent. A great way to study them both lies in kata. Goshin-jutsu-no-kata has many strikes that are used to create kuzushi, and katame-no-kata features a gnarly knee lock at it's conclusion. ""Pure judo"" really includes lots of interesting techniques."
judo,37lod5,IFeelLikeBasedGod,3,Thu May 28 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'll have to check that out.  I know leglocks are part of an old kata, but are never really taught in the modern day.   I thought atemi-waza were taught strictly to be a proper uke in certain katas that contain strike counters. I know of no Judo schools anywhere that teach strikes for anything other than that reason. If I am wrong I apologize.   Both of these things have essentially been phased from Judo. While they are still technically part of Judo, the point stands that you most likely won't learn them."
judo,37lod5,silvaphysh13,2,Thu May 28 15:58:45 2015 UTC,"Katame-no-kata, along with nage-no-kata, form the randori-no-kata, which is generally considered the ""must-learn"" kata for most dan grades. Furthermore, in both goshin-jutsu and kime-no-kata, strikes are performed by tori to execute the technique. In my opinion, things are only ""phased"" from judo if you decide for adhere strictly to the mainstream trends. Judo should be a personal exploration. If these are things you're interested in, practice them, and keep them alive!"
judo,37lod5,judokalinker,5,Thu May 28 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"One of the things that makes judo so effective is how it is trained. Randori allows for live training, and any training not supplemented by live training is much less effective than otherwise. Atemi-waza is not trained in judo with liveness, and you can only really get a cursory knowledge. If you interested in strikes, learn a striking art. Just like I wouldn't suggest learning TKD for someone who wants to learn throws, because some dojangs teach some throws, I wouldn't suggest judo for learning strikes."
judo,37lod5,osotogary_,2,Fri May 29 00:06:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but are people sparring with strikes? Lets be real, there's only so much you can learn from a form, and that gap is where randori comes in. If you never apply it, can you really say that you've learned it?"

judo,37n5wt,SVPPB,6,Fri May 29 04:59:46 2015 UTC,"Look at the clip again. She pushes him to create space for the throw.  He instinctively moves forward in reaction to the push.  Then she inmediately pulls towards her as she drops to execute the throw. Since the man was moving forward, her pulling puts him off-balance, so he is easily thrown. Basically he walked right into the throw.  If the man had been an experienced judoka he might not have fallen for it.   For example, when she first pushed him, he could have stepped back and kept a wide base. Maybe even use that push to his benefit, and throw her instead. Judo is a game of playing with each other's balance until you find or create an opening for a throw.  Another possibility would be that when she grabs and twists his lapel, he sees the seoi nage coming at the last second. Then he would regain his balance and bend his legs into a half squat to lower his center of gravity. That would make her throw fail, and now she is on her knees giving him her back, very vulnerable to a choke."
judo,37n5wt,nearlydammit,4,Fri May 29 11:03:26 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of experience. I am sure most skilled judokas could have avoided her throw by seeing it coming. I am a pretty bad yellow belt and I can avoid nearly half of the knee seoi nages in randori by black belts. Although I give her points for executing it very smoothly, you can either block it from happening at all by lowering your weight, being a bad uke by using stiff arms to keep her far from you and if you see it coming you can just slide to the side, sit on top of her or in the worst case scenario you would at least know how to roll from such a throw so that you would not land face-first."

Globally it is widely used. Many times it is used as a transition to a variation of kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame where you sit on top of the opponent for osaekomi, similar to this.

There's a good chance that somewhere along the way progress will stall out long enough for the ref to call matte.  There are triangles though, it's just the inverted variety as a turtle break/turnover. You'll see that type of sankaku as an entanglement/hold down as often as a strangle.

judo,37krto,Judostu,5,Thu May 28 10:20:25 2015 UTC,Go for it man. Cross-training BJJ might also give you a few tricks up your sleeve for the ne-waza part of the 2nd dan grading. They probably see the same stuff over and over again. Examiners love innovative stuff that works :)

I do the opposite with Judo once a week and while I'd get demolished by most judoka, I do fairly well standing up against my BJJ gym mates. I think you would have a similar effect with newaza. It'll take you forever to get a blue belt though unless your newaza is damn near blue belt already. I assume perhaps you plan on upping BJJ practice after you get 2nd Dan since you have a tight timeline to get that due to age."
judo,37krto,fedornuthugger,1 point,Thu May 28 15:04:34 2015 UTC,Getting a blue and being at blue belt level can be two seperate things though. So yeah I understand that training BJJ once a week will mean progression is slow but i'll still be practising groundwork when I do Judo so really its like traiing twice a week.

If you already knew the ropes as a dan grade it might go a bit better.   To put a bit of context around it, I wouldn't go to Oxford and expect to train with their competition rowers. Or Ohio State and practice with the elite wrestling team. Those are comparable to judo at Tokai, I don't think they have recreational practices."

judo,37kldc,13FiSTer,1 point,Fri May 29 20:50:02 2015 UTC,above is 100% correct. Find their feeder high schools (schools that the good universities recruit from for their own judo team) and ask to train with them. Sure you are competing against younger judokas but they are of a very high standard. I would highly suggest trying to get an introduction through any judo contacts before you leave for Japan (someone that may vouch for you).

I do, but my teacher talks super fast with a particular dialect, so I don't understand everything. He shows me more than tells me. Plus you've got nine months under your belt. You can do it no worries.  Edit: as for tips, I don't know how things are done in your country, but make sure in Japan that you really show comical amounts of respect to the teachers and seniors. And humble yourself. Say you aren't good. If you're good, they'll see it. And when they see it and say, ""you're good"", say, ""no I'm not."" It won't change the fact that you're good. That'll make them like you because you're like a Japanese person and trying to fit in. That'll make them want to show you and help you."

It all depends on how it is done. Search YouTube for instructionals on those three techniques, and see if you can find the one you mean and get back to me :)"

judo,37gf50,fleischlaberl,3,Wed May 27 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"It isn't just about practising or preparing for contest, it's being able to actually put the martial art you've trained into practise. It's the difference between kicking a football and playing against your friends in a 5 vs 5.  We do light and normal randori. Light randori consists of going at 30% and focusing on set ups and off balancing people. Normal randori is just normal randori."
judo,37gf50,Kosoto_Gake,3,Wed May 27 13:18:17 2015 UTC,"I think randori, shiai, and kata are all components to be used as tools for judo. Judo, as defined by Kano, is not the winning of prizes in shiai, or throwing the most in randori. Judo is an ephemeral, abstract ideal that one strives for their entire life. I really like the way my sensei phrases it: ""I do not teach you judo throws. I use throws to teach you judo."""
judo,37gf50,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed May 27 13:27:48 2015 UTC,"""I do not teach you judo throws. I use throws to teach you judo.""   Thats a good quote!  ."

It sums up what I think Kano was trying to create, which was a big, philosophical notion that is very clearly illustrated in a grappling art. It's kind of like demonstrating inertia with a slinky. The slinky is a great tool to visualize and study the notion, but inertia as a concept is way bigger and more universally applicable."
judo,37gf50,Ryvai,2,Wed May 27 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the goal of randori is to develop one's understanding of 'debana' (opportunity to attack) and how to capitalize on it through waza. Free-exercise, which randori is all about, is almost the opposite of kata, which consists of pre-defined attack patterns and reactions. In randori the opponent moves freely, and it is up to you to deploy any technique available or take advantage of any weakness you might identify.  I've seen two main categories of randori;   Traditional randori that allows any waza in the curriculum (e.g. morote-gari), but still follows the restrictions of kinshi-waza (prohibited techniques). Randori that is following the IJF-ruleset (most common), avoiding moves that would get penalized.   Within those two, I've seen different philosophies;   Randori which focuses mainly on the development of debana and kuzushi (kodokan style), starting with traditional kumi-kata, no russian grips etc. Light randori with limited resistance, no exagerated defensive moves. If the entry is good, one takes the fall.  Competition focused randori, closely resembling shiai where the intensity is high and the resistance is realistic (most common) Either they follow-up with ne-waza or they don't. In my experience most people just get up for safety reasons when there are more people on the mat.   For me as an active competitor. The ideal randori is mostly light (to learn new things), following IJF-ruleset, but with competition focused randori a few times a week to really test skills."
judo,37gf50,91echomike,1 point,Wed May 27 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"most of the time we separate tachiwaza and newaza, but both are done following IJF rules and mostly at a shiai pace. We usually start with newaza, but one person starts in turtle with their partner on their back (similar to collegiate wrestling). After switching top/bottom and changing partners a few times, we go right into tachiwaza. Because we are a small club (average 4-8 judoka), usually we have one person stay out and rotate through everyone else, then next in line cycles through. When we get closer to a shiai we will include newaza continuation from tachiwaza to really gage where we are at. Also, I feel like some good newaza randori before tachiwaza really forces you to use better technique and is better for getting your endurance up."
judo,37gf50,aronnax512,1 point,Wed May 27 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"Ashi Waza randori- mostly used to work on timing and control.  Ne Waza randori- a common way to warm-up after stretching or to practice a ground technique we just drilled.  Tatchi Waza randori- standing techniques only.  Tatchi Waza into Ne Waza randori- regardless of whether you think you scored an ippon, you follow them down and continue until someone secures a pin or they tap. The intensity is moderate, it's not shiai, but you can't be lazy either. This is my ideal form of randori, as it encourages you to really develop your entire game."
judo,37gf50,bozo78,1 point,Thu May 28 00:33:24 2015 UTC,"Ideal randori is one in which I don't get hurt & I get to throw my partner :) More broadly, ideal randori is any session where it's safe enough to practice and learn new things. There's a lot to be said for French randori (basically throw for throw except uke is moving realistically, albeit not attacking), nagekomi (esp. Crash mat work) and the like. Right now we're preparing for comp, so randori tends to be ""pick guy x to work on aspect a, pick guy z to work on aspect b"" etc.  One thing that people don't do enough of (me too) is set little subgoals like that in randori. ""If he outweighs me by 30lbs, I will spend the next 2 minutes moving him around, stripping his right grip and then attacking with kouchi. In the last 30 seconds, I will switch to harai"""

judo,37gf50,skytomorrownow,1 point,Sun May 31 05:04:56 2015 UTC,"What do you think is the purpose/goal of randori?   The purpose of randori is to try to perfect your techniques against a resisting and attacking partner, without the pressure, finality, and sometimes intensity of shiai. The purpose of randori is to perfect your attitude toward training, hardship, difficulty, success, and failure.   The goal of randori is to perfect your techniques while provide a high quality and realistic, yet non-injurious target for your partner in an atmosphere of mutual welfare and benefit.   What is an ""ideal randori"" to you?   An ideal randori for me is where I trust and respect my partner enough, as they do I, so that we can assess our limitations, and then push ourselves into unknown territory, fearlessly engaged in experimentation and discovery of ours and our partners capabilities. An ideal randori is without ego or fear because the two combatants are learning, not contesting."

judo,37eusf,PoachedEggsOnToast,1 point,Wed May 27 09:45:01 2015 UTC,At my club we did barely any standing randori for a few weeks because our sensei was injured and couldn't come and teach which meant we weren't insured very well if someone had an injury. Don't know if that's related to your club. It could be that your club would rather focus on kata and technique rather than randori and competition. Try asking some of the other judoka at your club

This gives me hope that I've found a good dojo. I just hope my regular sensei will do more classes similar to tonight. Like you guys mentioned, randori should be done regularly!

Is that normal?  The club has members that compete so I'm confident that it isn't a Mcdojo, but still. The ""advanced"" class does randori for half an hour though. Is this the standard?"
judo,37eusf,silvaphysh13,1 point,Thu May 28 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think that's unusual at all. Some dojos will simply take white belts and drop them in the meat grinder, so to speak. I believe this is an unsafe practice. I think 2 months is a good amount of ukemi and tachi waza introduction, and white belts should at least be at the point where they won't cause injury to themselves or others."
judo,37eusf,That_Stinky_Gi_Guy,1 point,Thu May 28 13:24:31 2015 UTC,"If it's a beginners only class, some clubs avoid randori because newer white belts will injure and try to totally destroy each other.

judo,37eusf,Ryvai,2,Wed May 27 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"Since that's the case, why in judo to people always refer to rank by belt color?  Wouldn't just saying 6th kyu, 3rd kyu, etc. be much less confusing?  That's essentially what we do for dan ranks, though in English 'nth degree black belt' seems to be the more common phrasing."
judo,37eusf,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Wed May 27 05:34:01 2015 UTC,"Probably because, as kyu-grades, our rank increases and the color changes. We have an relationship to those colors. Black belts don't change until you get 6th dan, so the 'dan' changes. It's just normal I guess, students are kyu by 'color', and black belts by their 'dan'. But you are right that it's most correct to refer to students by kyu rank, it's just not that normal in the west I guess :p"
judo,37eusf,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,1 point,Wed May 27 07:14:44 2015 UTC,Kyu grades have different meanings with different federations (in fact quality varies from club to club) as well. It wouldn't fix anything.
judo,37eusf,Ryvai,1 point,Wed May 27 15:05:04 2015 UTC,"Because, for most people, a color is easier to remember and refer to than some Japanese words."
judo,37eusf,Rojugi,1 point,Wed May 27 19:41:07 2015 UTC,"In some federations, yes. In some Nordic countries adult ranks (from 14y) are the traditional 1st kyu, 2nd kyu etc. While the junior belts are called 'mon' grades, e.g. 1st mon, 2nd mon, and so on. The belts are white, with a colored line in the middle. These grades contain all the throws and hold-downs, but not shime-waza and kansetsu-waza, as they are too young to practice them safely."

judo,37eusf,JIVEprinting,1 point,Thu May 28 09:13:05 2015 UTC,"Do you suffer from muscle aches? If you didn't do much sport before, or strained rarely used muscles (which isn't uncommon when new to Judo), muscle aches can last up to two weeks. Sorry.  If you keep going, your body will get used to it soon and you'll rarely have muscle aches or at least don't care much about them anymore. To prevent the worst muscle aches, always do stretching exercises after training or during breaks if you get any.  Or do you refer to some other kind of pain?"
judo,37eusf,iushiush,1 point,Thu May 28 09:33:40 2015 UTC,"I started this year!  The pain stopped after close to 1 month in my case. Now I'm not sure if the pain stopped, I'm tougher, I get used to it or I just don't care about the pain anymore.   The most common pain I felt when starting was at my lower back because my ukemi was (still improving) very poor.    And the other pain very common that stills happens a lot is because of bruises around my hearth zone during randori. Since we tend to do randori with similar ranks, most white belts like me are very stiff so we kinda ""punch"" the opponent all the time trying to connect a technique.   Having said that if you have any other weird or incapacitating kind of pain, please talk to your sensei and go to a physician."
judo,37eusf,pandawdy,1 point,Fri May 29 04:49:25 2015 UTC,"Is there a decent way to bait a uke into moving (thus creating an opportunity for kuzushi) without giving up major ""position"" on grips?"
judo,37eusf,pandawdy,1 point,Thu May 28 23:02:01 2015 UTC,"By moving yourself I'd say. Once you have a grip and as long as you are able to maintain a stable, upright stance, you can move still pretty freely yourself and your opponent usually has to react somehow.  You can play with the distance, meaning if you move backwards (and this doesn't have to be a strong, obvious pull), your opponent may just follow you. You may be able to exploit his forward movement.  If you get really close to him instead, he may want to step away. A classic is placing one's foot between uke's legs such that your foot/leg touches one of his legs to trigger an evasion movement. It's basically feinting O Uchi Gari or Ko Uchi Gari. The evasion movement can be exploited as well.  Examples:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8HJ38sDWXk  https://youtu.be/nj__cHmpFf4?t=5m28s  Instead of feints you can also go for full combinations of course.  Ashi Waza in general like Ko Uchi Gari, O Uchi Gari, De Ashi Harai, Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi, Ko Soto Gari etc.. are great openers and excellent to disturb your opponents stance and game.  Another way is changing the level of your center of mass, twisting and turning and pulling/pushing towards odd angles. This is hard to describe and probably even harder to do. Take a look at what Hiroshi Katanishi does here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YfPZpln1WI  Last but not least all these ideas are more or less related to the principles of exaggeration, meaning basic kuzushi and hando no kuzuhsi, unbalancing by counter-reaction, of which we have here some wonderful examples each:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPYXaUchQV8"
judo,37eusf,pandawdy,1 point,Fri May 29 08:25:48 2015 UTC,"I'm having trouble doing techniques left sided. I just started this year and we practice almost (90% of the time) right side moves. I think because they are easier to grasp. So I'm very unilateral when it comes to my techniques. I think it has something do to with the teaching progression, since most orange and above betls are all very ambidextrous when it comes to moves.   If I understand correctly, teaching moves from right side first, it's safer to Uke (since he expects and knows how to fall against that side technique) and it's easier to learn."
judo,37eusf,fleischlaberl,2,Fri May 29 04:53:57 2015 UTC,"If you practice right sided 90% of the time, don't be surprised if you can't do them well left sided.  Ideally one practices each move right and left sided equally, not only to basically double your arsenal of attack options, but also for even muscle development. If you are right handed, left sided techniques will always feel off a bit and vice versa, though.  If you think you don't get enough time to practice both sides equally, talk to your instructor about it."
judo,37eusf,Ryvai,1 point,Fri May 29 07:43:48 2015 UTC,Since I'm a white belt.... Is BJJ stronger when it comes to ground work?
judo,37eusf,fleischlaberl,1 point,Sat May 30 20:40:52 2015 UTC,"It's not easy to answer that question. I'll try, tough.  The technical canon is basically identical, but the rules are different and thus the tactics and the focus of the training is very different as well.   Ground fighting is usually taught systematically in BJJ, which is something most Judo clubs I visited don't do. Also the percentage of training time spent on the ground in BJJ is usually much greater than that in Judo. So your average BJJist will have superior ground technique compared to your average Judoka with the same practice time.  If you want to compete in Judo under the current IJF rules though, BJJ may not teach you much that'll help you there. If you want to be a better ground fighter and your Judo club doesn't use a systematic approach, BJJ can greatly improve your game."

judo,37e6kk,-FishPants,3,Tue May 26 23:46:18 2015 UTC,"I would suggest this to anyone who gets a chance.  Visiting other clubs gives you a taste of how other dojos are run, builds camaraderie, and allows you to experience aspects of judo you may not have had a chance to.  It also gives them a chance to learn off of you, with both parties coming out better for it.  You know, mutual benefit and welfare. :)"
judo,37e6kk,burritopete,2,Wed May 27 02:47:12 2015 UTC,Totally agree with this. Every dojo trains slightly differently and has different types of Judoka that train there. Training with them helps all parties concerned

How could German, French or English kings reclaim anything in the Middle East?  How is it justified, to massacre civilists? That's -as just one example- what the knights of the first crusade did, when they conquered Jerusalem. They killed muslims, jews and christians(!) in the city all alike. The crusaders were no better than ISIS.  You may want to pick up a serious, unbiased history book sometime.  There are few, if any ethnic, religious or idiological groups who never committed atrocities in the name of their worldview. And any claim, that any act of war was justified, is at least questionable to say the least. In some cases (like defeating Nazi Germany) there's little doubt some violence was unavoidable, but in the most cases it's just about greed, egos and hate. And the ""side effects"" are always terrible. Fuck war.   No other religion teaches that one entire race should be exterminated.   ""Race"" is an outdated term. ""Ethnic group"" is more accurate. Anyway, did you ever read, what -at least according to the Bible- the Hebrews did in the name of their god to the Amalekites?"
judo,37cxa1,osotogary_,1 point,Wed May 27 05:55:08 2015 UTC,"The Crusaders were taking back land that once belonged to Christians. People in the Middle ages often saw themselves as a part of a religion more than a part of any nationality, so a Christian Knight in Germany would see Christian shopkeepers in Syria a 'his people', Muslims had very much the same mindset. It's foreign to our modern outlook, but it was quite common at the time.  The Crusades DID have some justification behind them, as retaliation against centuries of invasion attempts and slave raiding by Muslim states, but they got mean pretty quick. Medieval warfare didn't much differentiate between soldier or civilian, and both sides were brutal in carrying out retaliation.  But, that's enough arguing over history.    The only thing I can say about these people who abused the Israeli team is that they couldn't have been Judoka. People who step onto the tatami are better than that. The mob, well... the mob is full of cretins who can't even breakfall. Everywhere."

As I said, the Crusades were a drop in the bucket by comparison. The attempt was to reclaim the Holy Land for the West in general, as Christian pilgrims were unable to safely visit the Holy Land. There were a few misguided massacres as you note, and those were widely condemned at the time.

judo,37b915,fintip,6,Tue May 26 10:23:32 2015 UTC,"I like your ruleset although I disagree about a few things. For some background to contextualize my preferences, I would like to give you some background.  I am a former wrestler for six years and a Judoka. I have competed in grappling, wrestling, and obviously Judo matches.  I think ippons should be allowed. If grappling is meant to simulate combat then a perfect slam is going knock your opponent unconscious or at least damage your opponent pretty heavily. I think however that ippons should be more strict on the force and speed portion as sometimes in Judo ippons are just when an opponent lands on their back but without any force.  I think ground grappling time should be somewhat limited. I think pins should end the match in a minute. Think of it this way, if someone controls you for an entire minute they have won the fight. I agree about the positions shouldn't award points but I disagree that pins are lesser than submissions  I think that Brazilian Jiujitsu overvalues that portion of the game for that reason. In UFC and in real confrontations, when a person has pasted guard and is pinning they rarely just lie there helpless but continue punching. The stalling of BJJ wouldn't happen in a real fight.  Fights should be stood up if no progress is being made on the ground. This rewards explosive groundwork. Of course the standup shouldn't be as quick as modern Judo. I would say 10 seconds would be adequate for top player to make progress.  Leg grabs should allowed as long as they are proactive in nature. So shooting in and stalling should be penalized. Now I am not saying shooting in and getting sprawled on, I am more referring to when the person is clearly stalling and just trying to ride out the match.  As you can see my perspective is close to Freestyle Judo, although I have differences in opinion about the ground games importance. I very much enjoyed reading your article."
judo,37b915,Latinenthusiast,3,Tue May 26 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"Cool perspective, this is exactly the kind of reply I was looking for.   I think ippons should be allowed. If grappling is meant to simulate combat then a perfect slam is going knock your opponent unconscious or at least damage your opponent pretty heavily. I think however that ippons should be more strict on the force and speed portion as sometimes in Judo ippons are just when an opponent lands on their back but without any force.   If there are ippons, it has to be just like you say--only representative of when a takedown would have actually knocked the opponent out ""IRL"", with no question. No rolling uchimatas.  But not allowing a single throw to end the match is kind of like saying 'matches should be best of 3', for instance--it helps find the truly best fighter, by reducing the weight of ""one lucky shot"" into the mix.  I get that in real life, it doesn't work that way. But I think the goal is to find the best grappling there. And, like I said, I think it will also encourage people to not be so afraid of engaging.  So, you say the following two one after the other, which I feel is a contradiction:   I think pins should end the match in a minute. Think of it this way, if someone controls you for an entire minute they have won the fight.  In UFC and in real confrontations, when a person has pasted guard and is pinning they rarely just lie there helpless but continue punching.   My point with pins is that you would keep getting punched, kicked, etc. during many (not all) pins. I feel like a minute long pin would look a lot like a minute of stalling when you have a lead, and I don't want the pin to be used that way.   Leg grabs should allowed as long as they are proactive in nature. So shooting in and stalling should be penalized. Now I am not saying shooting in and getting sprawled on, I am more referring to when the person is clearly stalling and just trying to ride out the match.   Absolutely. I think the ref should have the ability to call stalling out in any form, and it should be about 2 or 3 notches less aggressive on the 10 scale than it is in Judo--still very present, but not like an iron poker in the ass.  I'm a fan of freestyle Judo in theory, would love to get to compete in one someday."

I guess I just disagree about the principle, I think anyone should be able to beat anyone at anytime. It promotes character. Not allowing throws end the match somewhat makes it more likely that the absolutely better person is going to win.  On pins, the point I was trying to make is that pins symbolize absolute control from an opponent. Because strikes aren't allowed in grappling they are equivalent to the MMA position of ground and pound.  I can see what you mean by stalling but its not because if you are going for the win then it can't be considered stalling.  Question: How tall are you?(I saw your weight cutting and sambo national matches thats why I am asking)"

I guess I just disagree about the principle, I think anyone should be able to beat anyone at anytime. It promotes character.   I was about to point out that a submission can end the match at any time. But then I had to ask myself: if a submission can, how is that any different? I think I just convinced myself to agree with you, that as long as the bar is high enough for what constitutes an instant win, it should be able to finish a match.    I can see what you mean by stalling but its not because if you are going for the win then it can't be considered stalling.   Well, even someone 'stalling' is going for the win, in their own way...   Also, most pins you cannot GnP from. And when you make enough space to GnP, you frequently create the space necessary to escape. The best proxy I could think of would be sitting in full mount, with your self up and away from your opponent; if you can hold that position for 15 seconds, you could have GnP'd. But that sounds a little strange to me."
judo,37b915,necrotelecomnicon,1 point,Tue May 26 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Personally a submission will always break a joint or put an opponent to sleep. I personally think r/judo overvalues the knockout potential of a throw. There's videos of guys getting knocked out or even killed, mostly from actually being dropped on their head, and then there's a bunch of videos of guys continuing on the fight almost instantaneously. If the the throw has power then it will punish your opponent physically as well as award points under your current system. I also agree pins and control are much easier when you don't have to actually punch your opponent. Personally, I'd still go for a positional point system. No points for sweeps or passing. Points for side control, mount, etc."
judo,37b915,Anthropolygon,1 point,Tue May 26 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"What you say is true to some extent, but the truth may be somewhere in the middle... But a real throw can generate a surprisingly intense amount of force. A proper, powerful throw will not have a guy continuing instantaneously. Kimura, the one who faced Helio, was known for knocking out his training partners in practice from his intense throws.  Thanks again for the discussion, it's been good feedback to think about."
judo,37b915,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Tue May 26 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"But not allowing a single throw to end the match is kind of like saying 'matches should be best of 3', for instance--it helps find the truly best fighter, by reducing the weight of ""one lucky shot"" into the mix.   I'd quite like to see best of 3, actually.  With two ""ippons"" (can they be called ippons if you don't win instantly?) you could win by chaining a perfect throw with a submission or pin, but at the same time you wouldn't risk losing by following a throw with groundwork like today. At worst you'd get a 1-1 situation, and this might encourage groundwork more. It would also naturally penalize rolling throws or throws that otherwise puts you in a bad position."
judo,37b915,Geschichtenerzaehler,4,Wed May 27 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"One consideration that I think would add a lot of fun and dynamism to  judo is a ""ring out"" rule. like in free style, or even sumo. with points being awarded for ring out. this would create a force pulling opponents to the center."
judo,37b915,waylonlove,2,Tue May 26 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"So, a kind of value given to being able to control the movement and flow of your opponent, dictating where the fight moves? An interesting idea."
judo,37b915,Geschichtenerzaehler,7,Tue May 26 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Slamming is legal; the answer to being slammed from guard or a triangle is to release the guard or triangle and breakfall/escape properly. The penalty, if any, should be on the player who takes an unsafe fall--just like trying to prevent an ippon by spiking one's head is punished in Judo, the player who insists on holding his guard even when he puts himself at risk should be punished.    It is possible to grab an opponent for a slam in a way he cannot escape from. Daki Age, if done by the book, does not allow uke to just let go, because tori hooks under his legs. He even might not be able to slap the mat with his hands. Proper/sufficient ukemi can be impossible. If tori gets the angle wrong, he slams uke head first into the ground. Also If tori lifts uke high enough and slams him at full force, uke's neck muscles will not be strong enough to keep the head tucked in. It's a really, really bad idea to allow slams!  Something completely different: How about a constant fighting time, like two rounds of 2-3 minute each. First round with gi, second round without gi?"
judo,37b915,Ryvai,1 point,Tue May 26 12:28:57 2015 UTC,"It is possible to grab an opponent for a slam in a way he cannot escape from.    Ah, I didn't think about that! Kind of my point, though. Even though I hold ranks in two grappling arts, I didn't know about this basic fundamental flaw in guard--and I'm someone opposed to guard pulling. What a loss of knowledge...  Then in that case, lifting them up for the slam would have to be stopped and considered a td point for uke without it being executed, I suppose. Same concept; don't allow something to be a rewarded tactic that would have serious consequences if the rules were different, if possible."

I think, likewise, I would have 'no-jacket grappling' and 'jacket grappling' be their own divisions. But the rules would remain very close, so that going between the two could happen freely. That's if we're talking about the idea of this being a generic 'grappling' Olympic ruleset.  But if we turned it into one single 'grappling' event, that would actually be a very interesting idea.

judo,376nki,PinchItOff,2,Mon May 25 09:01:39 2015 UTC,"I've been practicing Judo 2-3 days a week for two months. I was in the Heavy Weight Senior Novice Division. The two girls I went up against had a good 20 lbs on me. I'm pretty dense so (with out my Gi on) I look about 150-160, I weigh 180. One was a yellow belt the other was a green belt. When I first stood beside the Green belt right before stepping on the mat, my first thought was ""Jesus, She's a big girl."" I tried going for an Ouchi Gari but I wasnt putting my hip into it so I just muscled her to the ground. Idk what happened but once I got her controlled in the pin position and I tightened my grip as much as I could, she started to cry and tap... The yellow belt came into me and lost her balance making her drop to her knees and I literally just grabbed her lapel and slammed her onto her back, pinning her and popping her neck. It pumped me up knowing that I defeated two girls higher weight and rank than me. At the same time I was upset with myself for having such horrible technique. They were both surprisingly a lot weaker than I expected. After that I am hooked on doing Judo competitions. Do you think those girls were over ranked? I honestly felt like it was too easy."

(Which was a grading, we had to fight for grades years ago in the UK)   I wouldn't say those girls were overgraded necessarily, they might have good technique and knowledge. It sounds to me though that you may have more ""fighting spirit"" and aggression. In the novice divisions, this is what normally makes the biggest difference.   And don't worry if you feel like your technique was not up to scratch, it's good you are aware of this and know what to work on in the future."

First, I want to congratulate you on your placement. Second, I would like to say that I agree with /u/TCamilo19; you showed aggression. You were able to sense an already off-balanced opponent and seize the opportunity to further apply kuzushi. And as for belt color, I personally don't see a point at noticing it at our level of Judo. This is mainly due to my experience being beaten by lower kyu and beating higher kyu. Take that as you will. Good luck in your future competitions!"

I ask because at my DZR club, there haven't been a lot of women, so the women that do come through spend their entire time training against men that outweigh them by 50-100 lbs.  Then they go and fight people near their own weight and dominate.  Basically, if you're training harder than the competition is, it might make things seem easy.  We had a girl that moved to France and competed there.  Se was the only non-black belt in her division, but ended up winning."

Apart from being a human trainwreck, he is a really good Judoka and calls it a Seoi nage from the outside. His seoi-nage is also more of a seoi-otoshi. In that he throws you on the way down if you know what I mean. Hopefully that helped."
judo,375inn,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Wed May 27 12:02:08 2015 UTC,Definitly not Seoi Nage. Tori's knees and hips don't rise off the ground at the beginning of the kake. Uke is pulled downwards over tori. The question should be Seoi Otoshi or Kata Guruma instead and since uke's body doesn't really rest on tori's  I'd say by mechanic it is Seoi Otoshi. What makes it look like Kata Guruma are the the odd entry and the angle from which it is executed.  For a longer explanation of the matter Seoi Nage vs. Seoi Otoshi  look here: http://en.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/33t8hp/judo_myths_debunked_part_3_drop_knee_seoi_nage_vs/

The Koshiki no Kata, now part of Judo, was adopted probably unchanged from Kito Ryu.   So maybe they were about to look deeper at the Koshiki no Kata and had one participant wear armor for explanatory or experimental purposes.  I think there is also a research group for the old japanese arts of war (koryu bugai/koryu bujutsu) at the Kodokan. So if they did not look at the Koshiki no Kata, maybe they looked into something other koryu related."

judo,374d0m,Maple-guy,3,Sun May 24 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: I have never been to a police judo session, everything I say is hearsay from others who have been to the following sessions: http://policejudo.ca/  Police judo is meant to take someone who has never grappled before and give him enough tools to take down the average drunken brawler. Thus, you'll be learning basic takedowns (osoto gari), basic pins (kesa gatame), and basic armlocks. In keeping with the police mentality, you'll also learn things not allowed in Olympic judo, such as wrist and shoulder locks. You also won't work on turnovers, since in law enforcement you actually want the suspect on his stomach, since then he can easily be handcuffed. Speaking of which, you also learn to work with handcuffs!  This emphasis on police work comes at a price though. There are some throws that are not taught, such as drop seoi nage, as the suspect can hit his head as he's falling and sue the police force. You also won't learn throws that expose your hip, out of fear that you'll get your gun pulled by a suspect. Groundwork is also limited, as you definitely don't want to be rolling around on the ground in the Downtown Eastside.   If you just want to learn basic self defence, I think police judo would be the better option. After all, its very premise is to give grappling novices a basic toolset. If you want to take on high level fighters, then maybe Olympic judo would be a better option, as the training for that assumes your opponent is trained.  Why not try a few classes in both?

Theoretically Judo has it all, throws, pins, locks of all sorts, chokes, strikes and kicks. Also a lot of situational self defense drills (Kime no Kata, Kodokan Goshin Jutsu etc...). The problem is, that most clubs don't train Judo in it's entirety, focus on competition Judo only and often don't have instructors who could teach Judo beyond this.  What you can actually learn, depends on what's available where you live. Sports Judo will prepare you well for wrestling versus a single opponent who wears a jacket and has little to no striking experience. But for anything beyond that, you need alive striking, kicking and no gi training and probably situational and even mental training. While Judo could provide such things, it is unlikely you'll find a club that does.  So, what can you do? If you have Police Judo available near you, look what they actually offer. If you think it is insufficient as /u/blo2569 described, try sports Judo and cross train in some striking art like muay thai, kyokushin karate or boxing. Another option would be combat sambo, which basically has it all and a lot of Judo among it.  For those interested, here some Japanese police self defense with great Judo influence:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBwB1-GqjXk  There's also this book:  http://www.amazon.com/Self-Defense-Judo-M-G-Harvey/dp/1258142600/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432507530&sr=8-1&keywords=Selfdefense+by+Judo+Harvey"

The important thing is to find a training partner you can trust not to harm you when doing the more dangerous techniques.  Personally I'm rolling with leg, shoulder and wrist-locks, but not wrist-lock throws, on a regular basis, and even neck cranks, but it's with someone I trust completely not to injure me and vice versa (I can not stress this enough). We're always very careful when applying those techniques, taking it slow when we have them locked in, so the person on the receiving end has time to tap."
judo,374d0m,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,2,Wed May 27 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"In the UK there is a relatively strong tradition of 'police judo', they even have their own organisation and competitions.   Some of the clubs are open to members of the public and I used to attend one on a semi regular basis. It was one of those ""2 hours of hard randori"" kind of clubs, even though many of the people attending were not really at a level where they should be training in such a way. From my understanding, in the UK at least, ""police judo"" is just regular judo, only done by members of the police force.  If you are more interested in self defence, then sure, doing judo can help you. But you would be much better off taking up MMA or if you are lucky (VERY lucky) finding a legit krav maga type school near yourself.  Hope that helps."

judo,3710f0,Latinenthusiast,6,Sat May 23 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to two things: the gi and IJF rules.   We judoka and jiujiteiros are spoiled rotten by the gi. We've got grips everywhere that we can use to lock down even the most powerful opponents. Wrestlers don't have that. If a wrestler wants a pin, they've got to grab someone by their body, not their clothing, and a strong guy can strip those grips pretty quickly, especially if he's got a sweat going.   Second, since you win the match with a perfect throw, a lot of guys would rather just trade throws than risk going to the ground. Plus, referees stand you up if your opponent goes to turtle, which is further disincentive to train ground fighting - most people just think ""fuck it, I'll turtle"" and neglect to train ne-waza. So when a guy shows up that's actually good at ne-waza, and he catches someone slipping, that's it for them. By contrast, a wrestler gets his ""ippon"" (the pin) by groundwork, so he's highly incentivized to stay off the bottom. There's no one in high-level wrestling competition who doesn't have good groundwork."
judo,3710f0,bear-knuckle,5,Sat May 23 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"The gi does make gripping easier but the big reason is the criteria for osaekomi is much more relaxed than a wrestling pin (top position + one shoulder blade counts vs both shoulder blades must be down) and you have much longer to get out (20 seconds vs 2 seconds). Because of the rule difference, a Judoka in a hold down has to get all the way out to stop the clock (getting one shoulder blade clear doesn't cut it) and they have the time to secure the grips and hip position to make that full escape."
judo,3710f0,aronnax512,4,Sun May 24 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"I'm earnestly surprised no one brought this up yet.  As a wrestler, you know that being on your back with both shoulders down for even a second is bad news. Because it means a loss, wrestlers avoid it like the plague. It ends up being a primary focus in the sport, and wrestlers learn how to combat it extremely effectively. From a referee standpoint, its much more costly to mess up a call regarding a pin, so they make damn sure it's a good call.  In judo, because it requires a full 20 second commitment to the pin and only one shoulder down, the criteria for a pin is much more lax. It's enough time that, even if you get into a compromised position, it's not the end of the world (and those 20 seconds sometimes feel like forever). In refereeing, because an osaekomi doesn't inherently award anything, a mistaken call isn't the end of the world, and is actually extremely easy to reverse on the fly.  To address your ""don't fight as hard as wrestlers"" observation, I feel like you're not looking at it in the right context. As I mentioned, getting pinned in wrestling is the end, but not in judo. In judo, we don't have to fight super hard immediately -- we can take a breath, look for an opening, and shoot. That time affords us the ability to play a mental chess game. ""Maximum efficiency, minimum effort"" is a tenet of judo, after all."
judo,3710f0,SonicEuthanasia,0,Sun May 24 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"""Maximum efficiency, minimum effort""   Pretty sure it's ""maximum efficient use of effort."""
judo,3710f0,dzendian,2,Sun May 24 06:54:02 2015 UTC,"If you want to get pedantic about it, it's seiryoku zenyo.  It can be interpreted as maximum efficiency with minimum effort, or simply maximum efficiency."
judo,3710f0,SonicEuthanasia,0,Fri May 29 06:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, the ""minimum effort"" is misleading.  Throws are not effortless."
judo,3710f0,dzendian,2,Fri May 29 13:06:09 2015 UTC,"I've often been surprised watching grand slams and grand prix matches where the person in the osaekomi gives a quick attempt at escaping and then failing that they lie there until they lose. I think the reason for it is that once a good player has a solid osaekomi its next to impossible to get out and the player resigns themselves to the loss and conserves their energy for the next match. Anyways thats my two cents, I don't know anything about wrestling so i can't make any comparisons."
judo,3710f0,carpemaidenhead,-3,Fri May 29 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"Long answer short:  Many Judoka don't know what to do on the ground. That's pretty much it. In wrestling, one of the main ways you win, is if you pin your opponent. That means, if you get pinned, you lose. You practice getting people into pins, you practice doing whatever you can to not get pinned.  In judo, people think all the time ""well, if I just stay off of the mat, then I don't need to know mat work"" but they neglect the fact that their half-assed throws will lead to mat work, usually with them on the bottom. They don't know how to defend against mat work and are like helpless fish out of water.  Since you know wrestling, you are more ahead of the curve in mat work than most judoka. Just because I hate going to the mat in judo doesn't mean I don't train matwork in the dojo. For a lot of people though, it's pathetic watching them squirm left and right for 20 seconds when they boast about how amazing their uchi-mata is  EDIT: I didn't know people would be so upset when I admit that judoka aren't fighting gods. The question isn't ""why do I see judoka who know how to pin"", it's ""why do I see judoka who don't know how to get out of pins"". Holy crap. I've been going to tournaments like Am-Can, Liberty Bell, and senior nationals for years and have taught people who win in these tournaments, I'm explaining what I see. Sorry you're so upset over it, but I'd like to see you try to get out of a pin vs a wrestler try to get out of one"

Even way back in that Ronda Rousey match when she threw her opponent and put her into makura kesa-gatame and beat her face, that was such an alien technique to most but it's a white belt technique in Judo.

Osaekomi are enough to learn and teach good judo (especially for self-defense) and I think judoists get too banged up in randori to really emphasize athleticism like a lot of other grappling sports.  (At any rate, fighting from a disadvantage is not a good use of scarce mat time or training energy.)  It's no secret that conditioning is lax in judo compared to other sports, but I think that's an advantage.

judo,36tna3,JackVillain,5,Fri May 22 00:54:11 2015 UTC,"There's a number of longer videos with Jacques Seguin, 7th dan, on youtube, where he demonstrates many kaeshi waza and other rather advanced techniques. Here, beginning at 6:25, he shows a number of counters to Hiza Guruma:  https://youtu.be/rBxD5U9NjH0?t=6m25s  If you just started most of these moves will be pretty difficult though. Heck, they are even difficult for many very advanced judoka. On the other hand, maybe you can at least take some ideas from it with you:  If you feel his foot is coming, you can try to step over it. A variant of this I've seen is pushing away the blocking leg with one's other leg (the one on the partners side), then stepping over it and turning.  If your partner circles around you, you can try to avoid his Hiza Guruma by moving towards his center and try to apply a throw of your own.  Yet another idea versus an uke circling around you would be to stop his movements for a short moment. Let's say you have common right sided grip and he tries to circle you to your right (clockwise). Abruptly pull him downwards for a break of a second.  This should stop his movement and if he resists by reflex, meaning rising up again, you have forward kuzushi. Turn immediatly to throw via Tai Otoshi or Ashi Guruma for example.  If he tries to circle you counter-clockwise, first turn with him, then resist for a break of a second, load your muscles up with a bit of torque, then turn into his direction again, but at faster speed than him and throw him with Tai Otoshi, Ashi Guruma or whatever you see fit.  Yet again, all these setups are complex and require a lot of practice.  Last but not least another idea: Copy your sensei, try what he does, look how he evades or counters it."

judo,36qxay,MixMasterKing,0,Fri May 22 12:24:54 2015 UTC,"Why do you think this is a Hane Goshi?  Its an Uchi Mata.   When Ono pulled Uke over and stepped in, its over. It looks like a Hane Goshi cause Uke tries to avoid the Uchi Mata be stepping over.  Edit: All of the four answers are correct. Its not Uchi Mata - its Hane Goshi. Thx for your elaborated answers! ."
judo,36qxay,fleischlaberl,5,Thu May 21 14:11:34 2015 UTC,The IJF officially classified it as hane goshi when they recorded the highlights and got Neil Adams to do the commentary.
judo,36qxay,Kosoto_Gake,4,Thu May 21 15:18:47 2015 UTC,"He loads uke onto a bent leg, then straightens it out explosively when at the pinnacle of the throw. That's hane goshi. 'Springing hip'.    Uchi mata is performed with a straight leg. I doubt a Judoka of Ono's level would simply forget that and enter with a bent leg."
judo,36qxay,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,3,Thu May 21 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"Whenever people claim a throw is hane goshi, someone counters it is actually uchi mata...   The line between the two techniques is blurred, so how do we distinguish between the two? Personally, I try and look at the trajectory of uke, is he launched directly upwards by the action of tori's hip? If so, it may well be hanegoshi. Does the leg swinging backwards mean uke is forced to rotate around the fulcrum that is tori's hip? Probably uchi mata. I'd call this hane-goshi.   If you disagree, do you have any examples of hane-goshi being used in shiai that we can compare this too?  Edit - Spag"
judo,36qxay,TCamilo19,2,Thu May 21 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"Shohei Ono was probably going for uchimata, yes. But the situation changed once uke tried to avoid it by retracting the leg. In uchimata you reap the leg from the inside of either thigh, and Ono is a specialist on this. When the leg ended up on the outside he had to lift with the leg. In special variations of hane-goshi this can be done from the outside as well. Daigo actually writes about this unusual style of hane-goshi in his book and illustrates with a few pictures; example 1 and example 2. Ono did this on the opposite leg as opposed to the pictures."
judo,36qxay,fastr1337,-2,Thu May 21 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"hane goshi and uchi mata have been grouped as  same the same technique.... its not. Uchi mata is 1 leg, left for righties, right for lefties. this is a hane goshi."

judo,36qml3,RennodShinjuku,1 point,Thu May 21 17:18:14 2015 UTC,This is actually a common throw used in Mongolian traditional wrestling. It's done this way because the best grip to have is on the shuudag(short brief wear) to lift the opponent in the air before the uchimata.
judo,36qml3,beambeam1,3,Mon May 25 21:05:59 2015 UTC,1 was amazing to see.  Was #4 a Harai TsuriKomi Ashi or a really aggressive Sasae?

I think the key elements, aside from tori's proper technique, are to be unpredictable and to commit to your attempts."
judo,36sdv9,tranypanda,3,Thu May 21 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"The throw Ronda used is a fairly typical example of sumi-gaeshi as you see it applied in modern judo contests or a no gi environment.  It does indeed look similar to the first throw you posted, though I would say that is more of a kata-garuma or yoko-sutemi-waza.  The difference between the techniques is the direction tori (the thrower) is moving and the action of their legs.  In the Ronda example, she is moving towards Misha, then falls to the ground and uses her leg to assist flipping uke over.  In the Munoz throw, he is moving away and rotation of the shoulders and upper body is what flips over his opponent.  At least that's how I see it....  Edit - second viewing, it has similarities to yoko-guruma. Who knows..."
judo,36sdv9,TCamilo19,3,Thu May 21 19:22:03 2015 UTC,I'm calling it yoko guruma

judo,36rdu0,4324ipponthrowaway,3,Thu May 21 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"Belt grips and cross grips must be followed by an immediate attack now, I believe.   You might get away with it for slightly longer if you look as if you're setting something up but otherwise they'll shido you.   Double belt grips I'm not sure, I can't think of any times that would be viable though. Certainly an immediate attack though so I'm not sure if you'd even have time to get a second hand on if you could.   Deep back grips are fine although you may be penalised for negative judo if it looks like you're forcing them into the mat.   Double lapel is perfectly fine, I use it all the time."
judo,36rdu0,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Thu May 21 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"The one thing to be wary of with deep back grips is if you grip across the body's midline and end up with two hands on the same side of the gi. I believe that still counts as a ""cross-grip"". Same deal with deep collar grips"
judo,36rdu0,wingingitman,2,Thu May 21 17:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, as refs we are now told to watch for that hand crossing over the centreline.  This can happen with people who like high collar grips."

judo,36rdu0,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Thu May 21 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"On the high collar grips, the hand has to be pretty blatantly past the center.  If it is close to the middle most referees will let it go if you are actively trying to use it and not just be defensive or stall."
judo,36rdu0,Suey13,1 point,Fri May 22 17:42:05 2015 UTC,Only time you'll usally see a double belt grip is when someone is trying to throw using a bear hug.  Should be pretty obvious if they are using it to stall or just aren't effective at the throw though.
judo,36rdu0,Suey13,1 point,Fri May 22 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"""Normal"" means anywhere on the jacket above the belt, with one hand on either side.  You can grab two lapels, two sleeves, two whatever so long as your hands are not on the same side.  Single-handed grip is OK of course.  If you take a same side grip, including going deep over the back or collar crossing the centre, you have to attack immediately now, there is no 3-5 second count like there used to be.  Note that the attack occurs from when the grip is established, you are not expected to attack just because you put a hand on the same side.  As I understand it, combinations are OK off the same initial attack.  You can't keep the grip and just continuously attack with it though."
judo,36rdu0,JoeDwarf,1 point,Thu May 21 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to keep the grip if you are continuously attacking.  The attacks have to be legitimate, with demonstrable effort being shown that you are attempting to throw.  If you are just hanging out trying to fool the referee to burn time or get out of a bad situation, you are going to get penalized."
judo,36rdu0,Suey13,1 point,Fri May 22 17:40:35 2015 UTC,Is there some sort of limit to that?  If you're spamming continuous failed attacks off a one-sided grip that seems to be abuse of the rule.
judo,36rdu0,JoeDwarf,1 point,Fri May 22 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"There is a limit.  It is up to the referee to have enough knowledge of the rules, intent of the competitors, and the throws to be able to recognize it."
judo,36rdu0,Suey13,1 point,Fri May 22 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"The rules have ""slid"" downward very very recently, with several categories of unrestricted techniques being constrained to a few seconds and previously constrained techniques sized down to immediate (and I think a few even removed altogether, like hands on legs but that's older.)"

judo,36pd3f,Kosoto_Gake,2,Thu May 21 15:20:55 2015 UTC,Japan isn't quick at promoting.  They invented the promotion system.  It is the west that slowed it down.      Since we live in the West we follow what they are teaching.   If you get a rank in Japan like Shodan and bring it back to America it will be respected.

judo,36pd3f,Ryvai,2,Thu May 21 02:08:34 2015 UTC,"At my dojo, we learn a new segment of the kata for each kyu grade, so that by the time you test for shodan, you're practiced at the whole thing."

judo,36pd3f,Ryvai,1 point,Thu May 21 06:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it works out pretty well. For sankyu, nikyu, and ikkyu, we also learn the three sets of katame no kata. Technically, then, all black belts in my dojo are proficient at the full randori no kata. It also works nicely because I feel the sets of both katas escalate in finesse and complexity as you go down their lists of techniques."
judo,36pd3f,dzendian,2,Thu May 21 13:37:21 2015 UTC,"yes, ikkyu (1st kyu) is equivalent to brown belt in the west. It's not unusual to have one or two series of nage-no-kata for this test, but nage-no-kata is generally required first at shodan. I have to do this too on my next grading."

You're going to get demolished, you won't have a clue what's going on, throwing someone who doesn't want you to throw them is a world away from drilling. You'd probably be better off joining a wrestling or bjj class if that's the sort of place you're in and there's no other judo around, you're pretty much wasting your time."

Don't expect to be able to throw someone, in fact there's little point even trying. Survive on your feet, then when you both fall over try to work on the ground where it sounds like you've done a little randori.   Then ask your coach why you don't do more randori in the club. It's literally the difference between judo being effective and being useless."

It's very possible, maybe even likely, that the person standing across from you also has zero experience with  competition and randori.   Step 2: visualize what you're going to do. Do you have a favorite throw? Look at the person you're playing and imagine how exactly you'd love to set them up to hit your favorite throw.   3: Use push and pull techniques, without getting too wild, to off balance you opponent. Remember when you were visualizing throwing that person? Give them a good pop, are you in a position to use your techinque? If not repeat until you can get what you want.  This may seem extremely basic, but don;t forget; your opponent is probably in the same shoes.  Have fun!"

judo,36lqzh,kraegarthegreat,3,Wed May 20 16:48:21 2015 UTC,I don't know if judo is such a great choice in a situation where all your opponent needs to kill you is close contact so he can bite you.  So the obvious answer to all the situations is that you use your superior quickness and stamina obtained by practising judo to run away.

judo,36kqtd,Geschichtenerzaehler,5,Wed May 20 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"Regarding ipppon seoinage, is kuzushi up and mae before tsukuri, or just mae?"
judo,36kqtd,JackVillain,4,Wed May 20 06:25:18 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple, I fear.  To throw someone forward with Ippon Seoi Nage or any other throw, you need forward kuzushi. Pulling uke not only forward, but also upwards can off-balance uke even more, but it's not an essential part of the kuzushi. It actually depends on how you set the throw up, how you enter it and other factors.  For static practice with a fully cooperative partner, who lets himselves being pulled onto his toes, you can pull forward and a bit upwards.  Same if you go a bit beyond that and push uke backwards, then pull him forwards when he reacts to the push by a counter push.  If you pull uke down first to make him rise up and thus shift his weight forward, pulling up and forward is a good idea yet again.  If you enter by jump entry (tobi komi), you can pull uke forward and down onto your back with your weight settling down after the jump.  If you step between his legs to make him take back his foot, you just load uke onto you like a backpack and pull him down and forward.  And there are yet more ways to throw ISN...  Also kuzushi doesn't really happen before tsukuri. It's more like this: To throw you need kuzushi and tsukuri to happen sometime during the whole throwing process. Where each starts and ends depends on the setup, entry, etc. They are also not independent phases but part of each other.  Example: You push uke abruptly backwards. He reacts by reflex and pushes back. You have created an opportunity now. You begin to pull uke forward, which is easy now since he pushes forward. You don't pull too strongly though, otherwise he might be warned. You continue to maintain a certain pull while you position yourself for the throw, when your back is turned towards his chest you suddenly pull him harder forward so he crashes into you. Since you have already lowered your hips all you gotta do now is tilt him forward like a figure on a foosballtable. you topple him over you. Can you say, where the kuzushi began and where it ended? Tough, eh?"
judo,36kqtd,Ryvai,3,Wed May 20 07:20:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation, the idea is to bring uke onto his toes. Usually this is done by up-and-forward, but sometimes uke creates this kuzushi himself by action reaction and sometimes it can be provoked. There's no 'one-way' to do ippon-seoi-nage. As long as your center of gravity is lower than the opponent and kuzushi is present, it is easy to perform. Mae-kuzushi is the most used, but yoko-kuzushi is also possible. Generally speaking there are 5 directions in the happo-no-kuzushi that is applicable. Sideways, forward and the diagonals forward."
judo,36kqtd,dzendian,2,Wed May 20 06:59:42 2015 UTC,"Kuzushi for seoinage: just give them a little (yes, little) pull toward you.  You may be able to do this with just your fingers/wrists."
judo,36kqtd,fleischlaberl,3,Wed May 20 07:00:37 2015 UTC,"Am I doomed by my weight?   No, you are not. :)  Think of pins as dynamic techniques, not static ones. That means a pin isn't about taking one pose and grip and keeping it, but about making more or less big changes to one's pose and grip all the time to adapt to uke's escape attempts.  To prevent getting hauled over from holding Kesa Gatame, let go of uke's neck for a moment and plant the hand down to prevent being turned into that direction. Place your hand back where it belongs immediatly after that. If his hips or legs threaten to get too close to yours, create a little distance between his and yours. Adapt, that's the key!"
judo,36kqtd,Ryvai,3,Wed May 20 05:09:07 2015 UTC,"As GE said, pins are dynamic.  But the most common mistake in kesa gatame (and in yoko shio gatame) is, to put your weight directly at the chest of your opponent. You have to put your weight in an angle of 45 degrees at your opponent, so that you cant be pushed directly or rolled easily. There is an old analogy: A nail, which is straight in a board, can be removed easily, a nail which is diagonal, can be removed only with difficulties.  ."
judo,36kqtd,Ryvai,2,Wed May 20 05:44:04 2015 UTC,"Some osaekomi-waza are more suited than others depending on weight, strength and technical knowledge. If done right kesa-gatame by a light person can be very effective but it might be a good idea to find alternatives that work better for you, like some modified yoko-shiho-gatame where you are able to put more weight on your opponent. The majority of your effective body weight is likely to be in your torso, put pressure onto uke that way."
judo,36kqtd,fedornuthugger,1 point,Wed May 20 09:06:42 2015 UTC,"Probably the ones that enable you to use your weight more effectively and nullify some of the strengths of your opponent. Containing elements of bringing his hands high and where you can apply pressure to the upper part of his torso, like mune-gatame, which is a variation of yoko-shiho-gatame. But you should modify it a bit so that you control his arms. I'm relatively short, but I'm stocky built, that works well for me at least. The whole idea of osaekomi is to adjust your position continually depending on what the opponent does, reclaim stability and adjust constantly before uke can utilize the momentum and take advantage of it."
judo,36kqtd,ckristiantyler,2,Wed May 20 07:20:09 2015 UTC,Your weight distribution is probably off. You can make that 115 feel like 160 if you distibute your weight right. Make sure you get control of the arm when you do kesa gatame. If you master their sleeve they won't be able to grab your waist. Make sure to control the head and grab the inside of your thigh as well. -   If you don't control the arm they will be able to turn towards you- grab your hips and use momentum to get on top.    another key that another redditor posted was you need to transition. Learn the transition from Kesa to other positions. When you start losing control you should transition to another position before you completely lose control
judo,36kqtd,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,2,Wed May 20 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"You're not doomed by your weight, really try and spread your legs out and have your body low. Lowest center of gravity possible. That center of gravity should be under your opponents chest. Put your head down and keep that arm is key in maintaining a good kesa."
judo,36kqtd,Vernonsunshine,2,Wed May 20 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"I find that twisting my body into them, as if I'm tightening the hold, really increases the pressure on their short ribs. This makes it harder for them to shrimp and lift."

I know I can improve this with strength and flexibility training which I'm working on. However, is it okay for me to put my weight on the balls of my feet or is this bad form? I find it a lot easier with the balls of my feet but dont want to train poorly."
judo,36kqtd,Ryvai,3,Wed May 20 07:17:42 2015 UTC,The balls of your feet is where your weight should be. You're off balance if you have your weight on your heels.
judo,36kqtd,fedornuthugger,2,Wed May 20 08:53:59 2015 UTC,"I agree on the balls of the feet thing. I usually explain off-balancing the following way;  'Kuzushi' happens when your center of gravity is moved outside of the area created between the outlines of your feet. Imagine a tennis ball hanging from a string, from your belt knot, at about your knees. Under your feet is a plain skateboard plate. Shifting the center of gravity, illustrated by the ball, in any direction that leads to the tennis ball hanging outside the area of the skateboard, leads to unbalance. I've demonstrated this to kids and they love it. Unbalancing can be when one is on the heels (ushiro-kuzushi), toes (mae-kuzushi), the edge of the outside of feet (yoko-kuzushi) or the diagonals in those directions (e.g. mae-migi-kuzushi/mae-sumi-kuzushi, forward diagonal to the right)."
judo,36kqtd,PoachedEggsOnToast,1 point,Wed May 20 09:26:45 2015 UTC,"The goal is to be on the balls of your feet for ease of movement - however, you're not supposed to have more than a paper thin distance between the tatami and the rest of your feet."

Go light with someone your level or better and tell them that you need to go easy because of an injury. Good luck and don't get hurt!
judo,36kqtd,JIVEprinting,2,Thu May 21 06:44:53 2015 UTC,"Strengthening the muscles in the respective area will provide some protection. Swimming and cycling are usually recommended since you can do that without putting your entire weight on it and it includes also the pulling muscles and not only the pushing muscles in the legs.   A good exercise on the mats is sitting down and dragging yourself forward with the heels. It will also strengthen usually unused muscles.  Aside from strengthening the muscles, stretching exercises to regain flexibility are a good idea."

judo,36lo8r,soulscream_,3,Wed May 20 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"There is a saying; ""control before submission"". It might be the case that your teacher wants you to learn how to control your opponent properly, before diving into all the possible submissions. Going for an submission without proper control many times leaves you exposed to being reversed or counter-submitted. Once you can control uke, submissions are more easy to do. It's not a bad idea to understand leverage and osaekomi before submissions in the early stages of training :)"
judo,36lo8r,JoeDwarf,2,Wed May 20 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"There is a saying; ""control before submission"".    I've heard it as ""position before submission"", which rhymes a bit better but essentially yes, you want control first."

judo,36lo8r,gentlemanofleisure,1 point,Wed May 20 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"If you are getting to the back that's great.  Get the position and hold it.  Most people will be working very hard to escape so you will get good practice at holding the position.  Some things to go for.   Seat belt grip (under one arm and over the other around their torso) This sets up the choke. Both hooks in (feet controlling their legs around to stop them spinning to face you) Belly down back control (you are on their back and they are face down on the mat)   Some things to watch out for:   Don't cross your feet (they can hook their legs over your feet and put pressure on your knees and ankles) Don't let them spin to face you (that's their best escape option) If you get them belly down, don't let them get up on their knees, stretch them out.  Otherwise they have a chance to roll you off.   I'm a smaller guy too and this year I'm focussing on back control.  These are some of the tips that people have shared with me.  Your instructor is most likely right and just wants you to be safe while training so now is a good chance to focus on the basics of the position.  That way once you go for the choke later it will be so much harder for them to escape."

judo,36lo8r,jujiroll,1 point,Wed May 20 09:48:38 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have a seatbelt grip and both hooks in, you need to push your hips down towards the ground and stretch your legs out.  It's like you are holding them and trying to pull their body to make it flat on the ground."

Training is about developing skills in a safe way.  This is a good safe way to develop the skills that lead to a submission.  If your coach has asked you not to go for subs just now, I think we should respect that.  If he is qualified to be a coach, he's qualified to make that decision and it is likely based on his experience of seeing people get injured.  This is the setup for the rear chokes.  The sub is only possible if the setup is tight, so best to work on the basics first.  Think of it like Uchikomi.  If you can break balance and turn in and get the guy's feet off the ground, finishing the throw is pretty easy.  If you can get to the back, get seatbelt grip and hooks in and turn him belly down and hold him there, finishing the choke is pretty easy."

People always downvote when I say this but I am totally serious.  Don't buy into the sci-fi movies, the body is an excellent mechanism that really can't be tuned any better.

I went to a judo club that was very much sink or swim, lots and lots of tough randori. I learned, but it was all very hard judo. I came up against someone from another club who had focused on technique and movement and it was another world. Not someone who tried to be tough and stand in front of you but actually felt for shifts in balance and acted accordingly and it was like another level of judo."

judo,36j9q3,Latinenthusiast,17,Tue May 19 20:13:06 2015 UTC,"Living in Minnesota, I've definitely made use of my ukemi skills on the ice on multiple occasions. Though I've not gotten into a full-on fight since studying judo, I did have one entertaining chance to use it. I was at a party, drinks were consume, and a rather large guy started talking about how he was a state kickboxing champ in high school (which was factual). We began chatting about martial arts, and suddenly he says ""Oh yeah? What would a judo guy do if someone put a full-nelson on him?"" He then proceeded to do exactly that. I chuckled, and threw him flat on his back with sukui-nage. Every time he and I have been at the same party since, he proudly introduces me as ""the guy who can kick my ass."""
judo,36j9q3,silvaphysh13,4,Tue May 19 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"Had a similar thing happen in Junior high. Was a green or blue belt at the time. Came out of shop class and a classmate who horses around all of the time puts me in a low bear hug from behind, and says, ""I gottcha!"" or some such, kinda with a tone implying whatcha gonna do now, judo boy?   Our school had a central square lounge area recessed in by a surrounding set of wide carpeted steps three deep. I had stopped at the top edge of the steps when my classmate, I suppose, thought it would be amusing apply the bear hug. I looked down at his hands clasped around my arms and torso and I guess I was mildly amused by it too just as we started to tip forward.   This off balancing triggered something unconscious in my mind, I think, and for what ever reason I started to calmly twist my body and turn my head to the right. My weight transferred to my right leg as my left came off the ground and extended out to the side as my toes pointed. A clean left harai goshi of sorts with no conscious effort on my part. I don't even fight left, and at the time I don't think I had done anything but right uchikomi.   With his body splayed across the steps, his now upside down face stared incredulously up at me while I stared blankly down at him from the top edge where I remained standing. Time stood still and our surroundings burred out for a brief moment. His confused eyes said to me, ""Why did you do this to me?"", and mine said to him, ""Why did you do this to yourself?   I considered if he might be hurt, but he was a rough and tumble guy of the social group who wore heavy metal themed shirts and faded and ripped jeans who liked to portray themselves as tough. He was a funny guy who didn't mid make a fool of himself though.   Time and the sounds and movement of students changing classes returned to surround us. My head flew back laughing, ""Hah hah hah!"" as I turned and walked away a few steps, paused, looked back, and belly laughed up in the air again at the hilarious absurdity of the occurrence and walked on to the rest of my otherwise uneventful day."

Judo teaches you confidence in heated physical situations and self-restraint. I've been confronted several times to the point where a fight is about to happen, but having confidence in my skills have prevented me from panicking and escalating the situation. Some people are assholes, and just want to start a fight for no reason. I've been working as a door supervisor for about 7 years and when I've been asked if I train martial arts I usually say that I have a black belt in communication, de-escalation is more important. Having confidence in yourself is, more than often, enough to handle it without violence and I think Judo has helped a lot in that area :)"

Doesn't sound judo related does it? Well it is, that confidence to step in between people and control yourself under pressure is something that I've taken from Judo.  Forget the thoughts about being a tough guy, having mad skills or popping peoples joints. Rutting animals can do that.  A calm mind, gentle soul and flexible thinking will:  a) keep you out of trouble from the police,   b) keep you out of hospital, cos you never know what the other person can do and if your only response to violence is violence well...statistically you're gonna end up fucked up,   c) kudos from people for being able to resolve dangerous situations with no one hurt   and most importantly for me:  d) you get a real sense of doing good from stopping violence...I can't explain it, but you just KNOW you're doing good/the right thing.

When my dad became a 1st dan our friend gave him that belt.  My own story: When i was at school (around 13), one day one of the idiots in the year above me had a knife at school (he thought he was a gangster but like i said he was a idiot) and he went to stab a friend of mine with it because he refused to 'be his girlfriend again' but kicked him in the balls and then held him down with kesa gatame until a teacher got there."

Here's mine: I was at my regional promotional tournament and had completed my written and demonstration requirements well and had moved onto the  kohaku shiai (red & white ladder). After throwing 5 consecutive opponents for ippon, I was awarded batsugun (double promotion). I must have had a very prideful look on my face because immediately after, Mr Takemori walked up to me, tugged on the skirt of my gi and said ""Loose some goddamn weight fatass."" and just stood there staring at me. My first reaction was nodding at this very respected member of Shufu and of judo in general. My later internal dialogue was ""WTF! What an Asshole!"" But later i realized that he did me a favor.

judo,36hpe3,isakarbast,3,Tue May 19 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"There are a couple standard pieces of advice I give to people going for their yellow belt. First, most judges would much rather see a technique done smoothly than quickly. Take a breath before each demonstration, and try to take your time with it. Secondly, it's my opinion that the main purpose of an exam should be to both celebrate what you've learned, and reveal what you need to improve. If you have a good sensei, they wouldn't recommend you for rank promotion unless they thought you had some chops. That being said, don't stress out too much about having some glitches, and remember that judo is a life-long pursuit!"

judo,36j5t9,collmose,2,Tue May 19 19:47:37 2015 UTC,It's a excellent base source if you want to be able to know what is expected for grading by belt rank for USJA.

judo,36j5t9,burritopete,1 point,Tue May 19 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"It is an absolute waste of money. On top of the information inside being available in better sources, the quality of the book itself is atrocious. It would be better off in a three ring binder, because the pages fall out after reading through once or twice. At 50 fuckin' dollars this thing better be made of pressed oak or contain the most holy of Judo texts.  My recommendation:  If you want to read up on the rules, you can find them all online for free. The USJA's handbook is rudimentary at best with rules anyway, you can find better stuff with a google search. Off the top of my head, Judopedia has a decent explanation of the rules for free.  If you want Judo learning resources, buy some books and watch Youtube. The Canon of Judo, Kodokan Judo, Kodokan Judo Throwing Techniques, all good stuff.  Full disclosure: I hate the USJA. I'm friends with some people on the board, and the place is rotten from the inside out. They recently discovered that their accountant was running the business side of things from her basement, claiming a bunch of money to renovate her house, and hiring all her friends to work for her.

judo,36g5rk,Kaito_Liang,8,Tue May 19 22:24:34 2015 UTC,I used to train Aikido before judo and I honestly find it useless when it comes to fighting a resisting opponent or a no-holds barred fight. However I loved the weapon play but other than that it's pretty boring.
judo,36g5rk,Geschichtenerzaehler,7,Tue May 19 07:29:29 2015 UTC,"I never tried Aikido, Hapkido or Daito Ryu Ju Jutsu.  As a general rule of thumb I don't look so much at the technical canon of a martial art, but at the practicing methods. If an art has some sort of alive sparring or randori where practicioners can practice at full force and full resistance against each other, I consider it more applicable than those arts which don't.  That's why I assume that Tomiki's Shodokan Aikido would prepare one better for a fight than other styles of Aikido. On the other hand there are some very traditional Aikido schools that -although not practicing randori- are said to be incredibly hard.  Hapkido seems to have a wide technical canon. Again, I think it depends on the training methods."
judo,36g5rk,jujiroll,2,Tue May 19 07:29:32 2015 UTC,"My experience with Aikido is just form having shared training spaces with an Aikido club for a few years, and from reading up on it. So admittedly I am far from an expert.   From what I did see though, it looks like someone took some drills that would be useful for developing a good sense of distancing and flow for stand-up grappling, and ignored all the other forms of training that you would need to go with it."
judo,36g5rk,JoeDwarf,2,Tue May 19 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"Aikido is fun and interesting. It's a good choice for people who enjoy the atmosphere of a traditional dojo but not the aggressive nature of alive training like judo. It's a long road to effectiveness as self-defence but people study martial arts for many other reasons than that. The dojo I trained at had a very gentle practice; I'm told some others are more aggressive which I would have preferred. The weapons practice there was crap, which is typical.  Overall it wasn't my cup of tea, I like randori too much.   Source: 1 year of aikido, a bunch of years judo and kendo"
judo,36g5rk,worldwarcheese,2,Tue May 19 13:33:56 2015 UTC,"Had a shodan in Hakko Ryu jujutsu and when I was a 6 month initiate I randori'd a Tomiki guy (not sure what rank) at a Bullshido TD.   Technique wise, I see them mostly as parlor tricks and party tricks. I often use the wristlocks when people at parties ask me to ""do a move"" on them when they learn I do martial arts. It always works and I get a laugh, but for actual self defense I would never think of trying anything from that system.   Toward the end of my time at the Hakko dojo we had begun light sparring where we fought for grips and broke them with the techniques and I was always getting in trouble for using the easier, stronger, and more natural Judo that I'd already started learning by then. Note - I'd spent years learning those techniques in Hakko Ryu and less than one in Judo and whenever I did Judo my opponent usually ended up on the matt where with the Hakkoryu I had a less than 25% success rate of even catching the technique, never mind getting it good enough to really control my opponent. I also found it ridiculously easy to stop my opponents jujutsu with just brute strength (I am not a big or strong man).   At the TD I found the Tomiki guy very good at breaking my grips but that was about it. He was older and stronger but he never got good grips on me and when he didn't immediately break my grips my whitebelt teenage ass sent him for a ride.   So when people say ""it can work if..."" I cant really see it."

judo,36g5rk,farkoman,2,Tue May 19 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"Downvotes aside, this is largely the case. If you have a base in judo, aikido can sprinkle in some pain compliance holds that could be useful in situations where there's no fight going on at all, just someone who's acting like an idiot and needs some incentive to leave the area quietly. Just be sure you can back your pain compliance up with real tachiwaza, osaekomi, and shimewaza for when things go from bad to worse.  Beyond that, aikido can function as ukemi training/mental relaxation for older judoka who can't train judo as often as they want but still want the social benefits of working out with friends and relieving stress. Taiji, yoga, zumba, etc. could work as well, but for some, the Japanese culture club angle is nice, as is the mental stimulation of playing around with technique."

Thanks for clearing this up.  We're forbidden from doing tani otoshi in class at my main dojo.   Maybe you're thinking of kata guruma?   About 10 years ago I learned kata guruma.  I haven't gotten to practice it since my main sensei is a huge stickler for the rules.  We learned it on our knees and would do nage komis of it on our knees.  After weeks of that, they hauled out the 8-12"" gymnastics falling mats for us to practice it standing.   It'll be awesome if you get into BJJ or Sambo.   I was thinking of maybe cross training BJJ again, but I didn't like the person I became while I was doing it before.  However, that could have just been the school I was with at the time.   Te guruma works great as a counter.   Nice.  I'll probably want to learn that.  It looks like sukui nage to me.  Thanks for your advice."

The closest I ever got to working it out was:  The cross pollination of two judo lineages (Maeda -> Carlos and Omoro -> Franca) was the original BJJ, and then in the 70s a lot of wrestling and sambo got mixed in, and then in the 90s a lot of catch wrestling got mixed in from the defecting luta livre guys.

judo,36eyd5,KarateCowboy,1 point,Tue May 19 13:15:23 2015 UTC,"IIRC Maeda left Japan in 1913. At the time, judo was still referred to as ""Kano Jujitsu"". It was after Maeda left that Kano settled upon ""Judo"". Kosen judo rules closely resemble what was ""Kano jujitsu"" at the time, so what Maeda taught to the Gracie's as ""jujitsu"" was basically that. The three were the same thing at the time. Additional emphasis was added to groundwork in Brazil, as Maeda was a ne waza expert.   So, if we say that Kodokan Judo is judo as what we have today, and ""Kosen Judo"" is the Kodokan Judo of yesteryear, then BJJ came from Kosen Judo, in that sense."
judo,36eyd5,Geschichtenerzaehler,6,Mon May 18 22:41:41 2015 UTC,"Maeda practicing Judo under Kosen rules is very unlikely indeed.  Maeda left Japan in 1904. If there is something the sources about him agree, then it's that year. He travelled the world, fought a lot of real and also some staged matches versus grapplers and maybe other styles. We have kind of a rough idea in what country he was until started to teach Carlos Gracie around 1920, except for 1916 where he may have been in Britain or not, but it's unlikely he was back in Japan and praticed Kosen Judo.  Matches under Kosen Judo rules did not start before 1914. In other words, Maeda, being outside Japan since 1904 missed that development entirely. It is more likely, that all the matches he had during that time, which probably were not held under Kodokan rules, shaped his personal style of Judo. I'd assume he often fought in win by subission only matches, which would shift the focus strongly towards ne-waza (""ground techniques"").

Just one reliable source, that says, that Kano or the Kodokan ever officially refered to Judo as Kano Jiu Jitsu. I have yet to see one. Some dilettantes like Hancock and Higashi who wrote the terrible ""The complete Kano Jiu Jitsu"", which contains no Judo (as stated by Kano) refered to it like that. Kano himself put great thought into the name of his art and he elaborates about it in ""Mind over Muscle"". There's no mention of naming it after himselves."

As I understand it, the Kosen rules were made specifically to meet the needs of the technical high schools.  I suppose it may also be that the original jujutsu schools around the Kyoto area really favored ne-waza and there was some carry over.  As for Maeda's use of the term jujitsu rather than Judo, I have heard a couple of reasonable sounding suggestions.  Both have to do with either Maeda or the Gracies participation in prize fights, a very quick way to get on Kano sensei's shit list.  I do agree that Judo was frequently referred to a jujitsu in the early days anyway, so maybe the Gracies just thought it sounded cooler (for all I know).  The small amount of reading I have done on Maeda did not particularly suggest he was a newaza specialist. Was that something the Gracies said in their book?"

In fact, he gives very little importance to belt color up to green. From blue upwards, you are supposed to know your shit.  In any case, a yellow belt means very little. It varies from one organization to another, but basically you should be familiar with the rules, etiquette, ukemi, a few throws (usually osoto gari, seoinage, ukigoshi and ogoshi) and a pin or two.

Granted I'm not super prone to injury, but a good club/dojo will be able to adapt to the level of intensity that you can safely train at. Any martial art has risks, any sport has risks really, so in the end it's just up to you whether the risk of injury is enough to keep you out of training.  We've had 45 year old, totally out of shape, super beat up men and women come and you just adapt to make sure they can learn without getting hurt."
judo,365sb7,dave_attenburz,1 point,Sat May 16 13:43:08 2015 UTC,"My serious advice is to do yoga first if you're as battered as you say you are. Judo is hard on the body but your chances of serious injury reduce dramatically with increasing flexibility. My source on this is after my first 7 years of judo I could barely move my legs due to chronic tightness in my quads. I quit for two years, worked on mobility in my legs and hips, then flexibility and now I'm better than ever despite pushing 30.   Then do judo and if you have time bjj."

judo,365sb7,oraq,2,Sat May 16 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"Probably not.   A lot of throws require that you essentially lift your opponent on your back, meaning stressed hips and knees. You will learn how to fall in Judo, and you will be repeatedly fall from waist and shoulder height levels - often from awkward angles. Meaning you can aggravate old injuries pretty quick. You will do those two activities at least 300+ times.  Per practice.   A lot of older Judoka that are beat up tend to focus on groundwork instead; following that trend, you may want to look into BJJ as they focus a lot more on groundwork, minimizing hard body impacts."
judo,365sb7,fleischlaberl,2,Sat May 16 13:33:59 2015 UTC,"Strength and dynamic flexibility prevents injuries, not static stretching. I'd recommend spending a good while strengthening all your supporting muscles around your old injury sites (you whole body?).   Even so, what others have said I'd very true. Judo is very high impact and, regardless of how strong you are, you're moving ballistically and getting thrown on the ground repeatedly. You'll get hurt. Everyone does.  BJJ may allow you to control the speed and explosiveness of your training partners better, but it's still a grappling art with emphasis on live sparring, so ""control of your partner"" is ALWAYS relative.  What others have said is also true, try to train SMART with more experienced players if you decide to do it."

judo,365a8q,Jysorandom,2,Sat May 16 07:23:38 2015 UTC,"I like using ashi waza to set up my forward throws. For instance I often use hiza guruma and follow up with harai goshi or tai otoshi.  O goshi is a great place to start with hip techniques, I would say also get good at uki goshi and harai goshi, as they can follow up o goshi if your opponant blocks you. I don't know your experience level though, so ask your instructors for more specific advice."
judo,365a8q,pk618,2,Sat May 16 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"Try some solid O Goshi attacks in quick succession and pause, next time you present a strong attack your opponent will likely drop his hips a bit to brace himself and block your attack...

judo,365a8q,Kosoto_Gake,2,Sun May 17 16:23:49 2015 UTC,I used to combine O Ouchi Gari with my O Goshi both from the same belt/back + sleeve grip. If they avoided O Ouchi they were often left open for the O Goshi. Faking the O Ouchi once they respected it also opened up the O Goshi.
judo,365a8q,fedornuthugger,1 point,Mon May 18 11:21:09 2015 UTC,"Try ouchi but with a behind the back / low belt grip. (Basically, almost the grip for ogoshi). Get them to step back/off, then switch to ogoshi when they do.   It's not the most realistic grip (people generally won't let you walk around like that for long irl) but it will teach you the correct forward-back chaining. Personally, I'd look at ukigoshi/taurigoshi or koshigurma as the follow up rather than ogoshi proper"

Get the kind with dried fruit or chocolate pieces. The fruit/chocolate gives readily available sugars, while the nuts give you more complex carbs, proteins, and fats to sustain you through out the day. The best part is you don't need a lot and it won't make you feel sick. I went through years of crackers gummy bears and such, spending way too much and always having more food than i needed. Till i had a light bulb moment while hiking and eating trail mix.   Eat a good breakfast early, hours before you fight, and whatever you like, you just need calories. Take a nap. Warm up, trail mix as needed. Be hydrated. I like oj with breakfast and water. I will do a coffee before i warm up, then i have BCAA and/or electrolyte powder i mix with my water bottle. I do light mix mostly water. Just water is also fine.   This is what works for me and what I recommend. It might not work for you. So just try different things that different people suggest until you find what works best for you. For example my teammate uses propel powder with the caffeine, which works great for her, but is too much for me. I get too stiff. So i like just a coffee early before i warm up."

judo,363j7r,Kaito_Liang,9,Fri May 15 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"I am a Judoka first, but have participated in Aikido/ Japanese Jujutsu/ Brazilian Jiujitsu/ Karate, Muay Thai, etc...  This response is probably more than you bargained for, but it's Friday, and it's a slow day at the office, so here you go:  From my experience, there is a significant difference in the way these arts are practiced.  In Aikido, you typically practice using a Kata methodology. Where there is a predetermined method of attacking and defending. In this method of training, Uke is very compliant, providing all of the kuzushi, and pretty much no resistance.  Which is fine when you want to try to refine technique. Aikido Randori to me however, is where Aikido loses me. The Tori, Uke relationship still exists. Meaning, the 'attacks', to me, don't seem to have any intent behind them, and are typically 'presented' as an opportunity for tori to defend/practice technique. In other words, uke never intends to win the exchange, and in my experience will sometimes attempt to make Tori look good. I have yet to see an Aikido exchange where both participants intend to win.  In Traditional 'Japanese' JuJutsu, it's a mixed bag. It depends on the discipline/ Ryu. I have practiced some styles, where if you don't defend, you will probably end up battered and bruised. (the intent is real, punches are not pulled), and if you mess up, you'd better improvise... quickly) (think Combat Sambo). Other styles, it's a similar 'kata' method of training methodology and will avoid sparring/ 'randori' altogether. The same is relevant in some Karate dojos.  Judo is generally speaking similar to the 'Kata method of learning' while practicing and learning technique ONLY (not randori/shiai). A good Uke will allow Tori to place Uke in a position off balance. AKA: (present an optimal target to practice technique).  Randori is completely different, however. Typically in Judo Randori, 'Uke' will not give you anything, so you must figure out a way to take it. The Tori/Uke relationship does not exist until the technique is executed. (both opponents intend to win). This means that the positions/ situations are drastically different than they are in learning environment. If you mess up, you don't get to 'try it again', you simply move on to the next thing/ learn to string together your attacks. This forces Tori to trick Uke into positions of Kuzushi (through strategy, combinations of techniques, and the application of force to generate action/reaction situations).  Also, there is no 'perfect technique.' Simply the varying degrees of successful/ unsuccessful technique. So, it's more about feeling, and the amount of applied force than the concept of 'perfection'.  In Judo, Strength and size matter; but probably not in the way that you would think. Uke will not jump for you. It is important for Tori to develop the strength necessary to execute technique correctly on any size opponent. Also, Strength can be used to compensate for a lack of good technique (not that I advocate the use of strength over technique). If you consider Archemedian physics principal of the lever. the length of the lever arm can dramatically reduce the amount of force necessary. On the other hand, if you have a mountain of force available, the size of the lever required does not have to be as large to achieve the same goal. Obviously, the goal is in Judo is to use as little force as necessary to apply technique, but it doesn't mean that bad technique can't be overcompensated with overwhelming force. (or that people won't try)...  Also, my comments are not intended to be a stab at Aikido at all, I reckognize that a lot of the techniques work, and plenty of practitioners that are skilled. I prefer the training methodology of Judo, and BJJ to Aikido because I believe it prepares the practitioner for a more realistic method of fighting. I will note however, that within the realm of Aikido, Tomiki Ryu is more effective than your average garden variety Aikido.  Lineage matters, and Tomiki was around to learn from 'O-Sensei', when 'O-Sensei' was young. (My understanding being that the older that Ueshiba got, the more esoteric Aikido became), leaning on the philosphy of Aikido, more than the application of technique against resisting. Where, in the beginning, Aikido was very much like it's roots of Aiki-jujutsu, simply put, brutal.  Listen to your Sensei, which I'm sure you are, practice more uchikomi/ moving uchikomi, and nagekomi, and as much randori as possible.  Good luck, and don't be discouraged, you have only been training 1.5 months.   I will not address your issue with Seoi Nage, because I have no real reference for what you are doing. Consult your Sensei, or take video of you executing the technique so that the Judoka of Reddit can evaluate your technique.  All the best.  -Steve"

I like the principles of Aikido, but I just can't see it working in randori, or in a real situation for that matter :)  Note: to those that don't know Ueshiba, he was the founder of Aikido."
judo,363j7r,Ryvai,1 point,Sat May 16 10:57:18 2015 UTC,"Very little of Aikido is applicable to a fight on the notorious ''street''. Probably based on the fact that post-war Aikido was focused on not hurting your opponent which is near impossible to accomplish. That's why I decided to call it quits and indulge myself in different martial arts, which most of my fellow aikidokas referred to as ''agressive''. Something I hated about Aikido randori is that often times the attacker is scolded when his partner can't perform the technique when it should be the other way around..."
judo,363j7r,ShinshinRenma,2,Sat May 16 11:11:07 2015 UTC,"Ex-aikidoka here.  It helps with some stuff (irimi-nage and osoto-gari will feel similar, for example), but not with all.  A lot of the ashi-waza I picked up from karate (which I also did before judo).    The key problem with seoi nage for me in the beginning was learning what direction my partner needed to be off balance to pull it off.  I found that issues with ""crouching"" largely disappeared after I learned that."
judo,363j7r,ahapkidoin,2,Sat May 16 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"I don't come from Aikido, but its disgruntled, angry cousin, Hapkido. So, some of this may apply.   Forget using multi-axis small joint manipulation to break grips. It will either not work, or you'll break something on someone. Stick to the basics there, of moving in ways that the orientation of your opponent's hand can not follow. I had the same problem with seoi nage. More correctly, I still have it. You've already identified the problem as its root, I think, in my limited experience. It's not good to give up your base of balance, but Judokas definitely commit way more into their throws than we ever did in Hapkido. Don't be of afraid of falling with your opponent, as long as you're gunning for ippon, or waza-ari, or just a position of dominance or whatnot. Its very difficult to get the mechanical advantage for a powerful throw against someone that is expecting it. I think thats where the concepts of continuous attack, and the bushido-like principle of not fearing death, i.e. not fearing the ippon, come into play. Just go for it. Always be attacking. If you win, you win. If you're felled, you're felled. Not sure how much this applies to Aikido, but be careful with your sweeps. In Hapkido, our sweeps often had more resemblance to strikes - for example, to move the foot through pain compliance and shock. Your training partner will not appreciate this, and it will keep you from properly feeling the kuzushi. Work the entire body. I had/have a tendency to try to grip the textbook points. Forget that. Yes, try for it, but get grip and leverage where ever you can. If you need to wrap yourself half way into his judogi jacket to get enough leverage for a shoulder throw, do it. Get more points of contact, not less. Lift persons with your entire body, not a simple mechanical advantage on one small fulcrum. Judo is about scoring ippon first and foremost. An ugly ippon is better than a pretty stalling penalty. Do not let your opponent get away with dictating range by controlling your neckline with a closed fist and jaming you about. You're giving up control of your center of gravity and you will regret it fast.   That's all the very limited, and very inexperienced, advice I have for you right now."
judo,363j7r,jujiroll,2,Sat May 16 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"I also have a problem while crouching for seoi nage. When I get into a position and crouch before i throw i lose balance and it's hard to perform the actual throw since I'm trying not to fall myself.   Run to the edge of the mats, turn, drop down like you are doing a very low seoi nage, then dive forward, and run to the other end of the mats. Repeat this a load of times. It'll get you used to dropping without falling backwards."
judo,363j7r,pk618,2,Sat May 16 11:53:55 2015 UTC,"Per the seoi nage crouch: my best advice is to drop your level on the very first step you take, and to stay on your toes. Staying on your toes should make rotation easier, help keep your knees bent, and help you maintain balance and drive the correct direction. A lot of throws can be done with ""lazy feet"" that are flat on the mat. Seoi Nage not so much.  Can't help with the aikido crossover, other than saying that a lot of techniques won't really work on someone resisting."

You are just on the road to being a better Judoka, you are now self-aware. Keep practicing and looking over your techniques, ask a sensei what's wrong, practice shadow uchi komi at home. Do your techniques slowly for the next while making sure they are perfect form, increase speed as you get more ""perfect"" in a row.   A big one is fight more. Most of us have been through the stages where we completely, hopelessly sucked. I didn't win a single match in tournament in my first 3 or 4 years in Judo. I worked hard focusing on improving and now there is rarely a tournament where I don't get 1st or 2nd.   Don't be too harsh on yourself, lacking natural talent just means you have to put more effort in to get the same gains, its unfair but you'll be a stronger person because of it.

I definitely want to compete, although I am not sure if I am ready because I cannot even throw people in lower weight classes in randori.  I am fine with progressing slower than others, although it kind of is disheartening to see people become more able than me within a few weeks. However, I am more concerned that all my efforts will be in vain currently."

Most people that I train with take almost half the time per repetition."
judo,362q36,ShinshinRenma,3,Fri May 15 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"Some things that would be useful; Since you seem taller than most people in your dojo I would look into Uchi Mata, Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi De Ashi Barai, O Soto Gari. Since these throws require less of you stuffing your self into small spaces/ require different types of leverage they could be very useful for you.  Now I don't know you personally nor do I know anything about your fighting style. So another thing you could do is ask your sensei or someone who is ranked much higher than you for tips on how to improve.   Tournaments are a great time to learn! You should definitely go into as many as possible. Why? They force you to fight with people you don't know. This means that they can't possibly know what you are going to do just like you don't know what they will do. You'll be in a category based on age, belt level, and weight which means the other competitors will likely be in the same boat as you! If you lose, whatever, it was a fun time, if you win, you'll feel great.  Now onto that last point in your first comment. Like I said, they may improve ""better"" or ""faster"" than you now, but if you really work hard, it'll feel so good when you win. When I was growing up I was trained by my coach this was from ages 13-19. He was 50lbs heavier than me but I always fought as hard as I could. I supplimented my training by going to another club (our clubs had a mutual agreement to run on opposite days), going to the gym, running, studying the mechanics of the throws and anything that I thought would help my Judo and when I was 21 we were doing randori and I caught him with a seoi nage. We laughed and he joked that I would never get that again. Lo-and-behold we start back up and not 30 seconds later I got another Seoi nage on him. It took 8 years to be able to throw him! 8 years of hard work before it paid off and I have never felt better than after that moment.   Keep at it, improve, grow, study, learn and you'll be fine. Look for multiple sources of advice, read books, watch videos, ask questions here all of these will help you. Good luck, and be safe practicing!"

judo,362q36,onyxsamurai,1 point,Fri May 15 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"Always listen to your instructors (or anyone who has been practicing longer than you). When practicing in randori, attack attack attack--don't worry so much about defending. Randori is not competition. When you get thrown, see it as an opportunity to practice your break falls. Oh, and practice your break falls as well.  You will find that some of the throws you used to always execute are suddenly not working anymore. You will be frustrated, but don't get discouraged. The problem is almost always fixed by reviewing your technique: maybe you weren't pulling enough, maybe you were pulling too much, maybe you aren't bringing your left foot back enough, stuff like that. Practicing a throw you are having trouble with should be done step by step: if you have a bad habit and only practice with full executions, you are only ingraining that habit further. When in doubt, the classical form of the throw is best. Your Sensei will let you know what you are doing right and wrong.  I'll repeat, because this really is the most important thing: don't get discouraged! Everyone who has ever practiced Judo has experienced the same struggles you will experience. Who gets the black belt? The white belt who doesn't quit."

Because I am taller and because I don't have the best coordination, I am afraid that I might hurt my partners if I just flail away.  I need to focus to not make obvious mistakes when doing static training at a slow pace."
judo,362q36,pk618,3,Fri May 15 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"In general I have difficulties moving my body, especially doing it quickly. Even when just doing static practice, I have trouble moving my hands and feet properly at the same time. So how can I improve?   Do you have access to a gym? Power cleans are pretty good for coordination. Hard to learn alone, so you have to be persistent."

judo,362q36,fleischlaberl,2,Fri May 15 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"Questions  Have you played other sports?  I'm curious what your athletic and coordination starting ability level.  Have you lifted weights doing full body lifts? Squat, deadlift, Clean/Jerk?  Observation  This may not be your situation so don't take offense.  I've noticed many of the people in my Judo club have not play sports competitively before Judo and lack an athletic foundation. So while learning Judo they are also developing athletic strength, coordination, awareness, and reflexes.   I am by no means an elite athlete but I have played competitive sports my whole life. Intramural sports in elementary, wrestling 3 years in middle school, basketball 10 years, soccer 4 years in high school, and weight lifting 5 years.  Having an athletic foundation gave me a huge advantage in progressing quickly.  I understood my body, had already developed athletic reflexes, how I learned, and had the strength and conditioning to participate.   Ideas  If you do fit in the category of Judoka who has not participated in other sports (that require coordination: not running) for a significant time then you should add in general athletic coordination drills and some strength training.   I think basketball is great for learning general coordination if done properly.  Proper form, body position, footwork, and hand eye coordination are key.  Work on the fundamentals and find some drills online that will work on those.  If this doesn't apply to you then please disregard it is just my observation.   Best"
judo,362q36,Ryvai,1 point,Fri May 15 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your post. You are spot-on. I should have mentioned that in my post.  I have done some sports, but mostly in school or casually. And running. But I lack athletic ability in general, especially core-strength and coordination.  I was hoping that judo would help me with that, because it requires many of the attributes that I lack. But I still feel that my progress is much slower than I anticipated. And I didn't expect to progress quickly at all.  I am looking to do other sports, but I find judo/grappling is what interests me the most. And I am a lazy person, so I was hoping that judo would be sufficient. But I probably need to do strength and coordination training specifically.  Any specific recommendations? Ideally things that I can do with no equipment. I might be able to do basketball,but i think that would involve no instruction.  Thanks again."

judo,362kzq,tobbleflower,2,Fri May 15 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"Rank doesn't really mean much, I've seen 10 year vetrans at blue, brown, shodan, nidan. Depends on the person. I've been in Judo for 17 years and I'm a shodan (although I do plan on going for nidan next year).  Its possible to get to Sandan in ~8 years depending on your organization and how much time you are putting into it. In Canada you need minimum 3 years in Judo for Shodan, 1.5 years in Shodan for Nidan, then minimum of 3 years as Nidan for Sandan. This is only the time requirements though."
judo,362kzq,Ryvai,2,Fri May 15 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on the nation, but generally colored belts are not that regulated, but dan grades are. The time-in-grade increases incrementally from 1st dan. So, if you mange to get black belt in 5 years, then minimum 2 year for nidan, then 3 years for sandan, that is about 10 years. 3rd degree black belt is doable in 10 years, but that requires you to be persistent and study Judo outside training hours. In Norway we have the option of using the '30 year rule', which involves a minimum time-in-grade of 1 year independent of rank, if the person turns 30 years the year of examination. This rule can only be used once. So technically it is possible to be sandan is about 7-8 years, but I've never heard of anyone actually making it in that short amount of time. Expect to be a black belt in 10 years, which dan-grade however depends on your commitment to training and study of Judo outside the tatami :)"

He just didn't have the time to go get his points for his dan grade but he was definately good enough and threw me all over the mats :).

judo,362kzq,bozo78,0,Tue May 19 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"Depends. If they've come up under my instructor, probably no higher than brown and most likely blue.  He himself has been 1st Dan for 45 years. Guy just does not promote.  EDIT: come to think of it, in the 10 years I've been there, he's promoted two people to brown who were blue. That's it.  All of our black belts got their blacks elsewhere prior to training here. Either he has impossibly high standards (he was a world level player in his prime) or he just does not give a fuck about belts. I've been at blue since 2006; I train 2-3 times a week and can assure you I don't suck."

judo,360l24,smegma_toast,8,Fri May 15 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between the way one throws in basic exercises and in randori. Unfortunately some instructors never, ever explain that.  In most basic practice, uke often just stands there and tori pulls or pushes him off balance into the direction he wants to throw. Uke plays along and tori can properly practice the throw.  In randori this won't work, simply because the partner will resist either by reflex or by intention to a direct pull or push that will unbalance him. The more experienced the opponent, the harder it gets.  Thus never pull/push abruptly into the direction you want to throw, unless you are in the right position to throw and uke is destabilized beyond the point of no return. Otherwise he'll just resist.  Instead try to play with action and reaction. Push shortly into the opposite direction of the throw to trigger a counter reaction. Or / additionally pull him down abruptly, to make him rise up and this shift his weight forward to his toes. Once he leans/pushes/pulls into the direction of the throw by himselves, just exaggerate his own force.  Kuzushi by counter reaction is called Hando no Kuzushi. It's an important principle, that isn't taught often or explicitly enough.  Combination attacks are the next step. They basically work via reactions again. Attack with any techniqe, see how your opponent reacts, and exploit said reaction with a different technique. Seoi Nage works well with Ko Uchi Gari, O Goshi well with Ko Soto Gari (right sided O-Goshi with left sided Ko Soto Gari and vice versa) for example."
judo,360l24,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Fri May 15 09:24:54 2015 UTC,What about the concept of rotational kuzushi?
judo,360l24,RatioFitness,3,Fri May 15 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"That's another useful concept. There are actually quite a few ways to apply kuzushi and one can even combine most of them somehow.  Rotational kuzushi can work by ""making your opponent take the longer way"". If you turn in place or mostly in place, he has to move around you, take bigger steps and move faster than you. So if you can make him do that, you may find an opportunity to exploit. Also while the human anatomy works pretty well when moving back and forth, it works much less well when moving in circles. An opposing concept is the application of torque on your opponents body. If you move around your opponent yourself you can apply torque on his body and twist him around the vertical axis. This limits his freedom of movement. Again opportunities may arise you can exploit.  This seminar footage about Ashi Guruma shows an example of rotational kuzushi:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0NrvHGcWE0  It's in this Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi as well (lots of twisting here):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkxugHsFN4E  This one unites many kuzushi concepts all in one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Zu9l_rmzI  (tori pushes uke back and pulls his right arm down, then uses uke's slight counter push to pull him into a spiral movement)."

Take a grip on the back ahead of attempting the throw and come in from the side seems to be the trick to get it in randori/contest. YouTube iliadis tsuri goshi for a good tutorial.
judo,360l24,dermatix,1 point,Fri May 15 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"O goshi is a hard throw to pull off in randori. The only success I've ever had with o goshi is coming in from the side rather than front on when fighting a left handed player.   As for seoi nage, ashi waza and moving your partner around is a good place to start, heck it's a good place to start with any technique.

judo,35zhpm,That_Stinky_Gi_Guy,1 point,Fri May 15 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"In Judo competition, there are typically no more than 3 levels based on experience:  novice (below sankyu), brown belt (sankyu to ikkyu), and black belt. Some countries make no distinction during tournaments and a novice could compete against a nationally ranked black belt.   In my opinion, your belt should reflect your skill level in competition against others in your weight, gender, and age division. If you've promoted to brown belt but never won against anyone in shiai in novice division, your brown belt rank doesn't reflect your skill.   Most of the lower kyu ranks are doled out by senseis as they please. I wouldn't put too much weight on that. Virtually meaningless."

If they pull you down, throws like yoko-tomoe-nage is effective, but I would not focus on that at yellow belt. If they pull you down, try to 'go with the flow' and don't resist too much, if you do they will take advantage of it and throw you once you raise up. If they pull you down in shiai without actually doing it to attack they might get shido. To counter it you could attack with a low tai-otoshi or seoi-nage as your center of gravity is lower than that of your opponent :)"

What I found would happen when I was stuck in ruts, occasionally I would have a singular expirience, maybe even a single throw, or watch a single video that would really click, I'd really ""get something"" new, and I'd hold on to that and use it to look for the next thing new I could learn. Hang in there, we've all been there."

I've found that when I finally figure out a throw, and catch multiple people with it in randori, I won't be able to hit it again for months. It's possible, nay probable, that your training partners have been going easy on you, and rightfully so because they don't want to injure or discourage you. Now that you've proven some understanding of judo they will ramp up their judo to keep you challenged. You will not improve nearly as quickly (if at all) if you are not challenged. If you stick with it long enough, you will find yourself on the other side of this situation. Just because you get better doesn't mean it should get easier, and if you have a passion for growth, you will always be able to find challenges."

Some turn and try to lower themselves afterwards. That's too late though. It's also important not stepping too close for Seoi Nage or you'll obstruct your own movement.  The fastest way to get into a squat is to ""take both feet of the ground simultanously"", ""falling"" into the squat if you want, instead of lowering yourself with tensed muscles.  If you have problems doing a squat properly (as a result of an old ankle injury for example), try stretching exercises:   Point the toes away Pull the toes towards you Point the toes away again Pull the toes towards you, but try to bent the foot inwards at the same time  Point the toes away again Pull the toes towards you again, but try to bent the foot outwards at the same time    Hold the foot in each position for a few seconds, repeat the above sequence for a about a minute, multiple times a day.

judo,35suh4,jujiroll,1 point,Wed May 13 07:11:06 2015 UTC,From lefty try squaring them up first so you are perpendicular (in front) to your opponent not just sticking your leg in at a 45 degree angle. Try using o uchi to set up that perpendicular line.   This vid is useful  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvx6cHBitLs
judo,35suh4,ckristiantyler,1 point,Wed May 13 08:15:48 2015 UTC,"From what I can see, you are trying to finish the throw against the guy after he has re-gained his balance and there is no hope of getting him to go over that way.   Tai-otoshi is a hand throw, and it's done with a bit of space between uke and tori. As such uki has to be almost falling to the ground from your kuzushi phase, and your hands really just steer the guy down to the ground. You can't really force it if they are not already going over.  For ages I had the opposite problem to you: I could do tai otoshi in randori, but I couldn't really do it in ichi komi - uke just wasn't giving me the energy needed to make the throw work and I wasn't giving a sufficient tug at the start to compensate.   Anyway, here's what I think you should do.   1)  Have a follow up ready for when uke has stuffed your tai otoshi like this. You can't force the finish, so get good at switching to something else  2) Get better at recognising the openings for the throw better. This throw is one that really, really benefits from uke giving you the energy."

judo,35suh4,ckristiantyler,1 point,Thu May 14 00:50:21 2015 UTC,You telegraph your intention to throw Tai Otoshi in a very obvious way. It looks like it is the only throw you try. Unless you have a very dominant grip or far superior power this usually does not work.  It's usually better just to attack with the throw that suits a given opportunity best. If you have a prefered throw you can try to create appropriate opportunities though. Take a look at this setup for example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6C79XS9T4Y  Try O Uchi Gari and switch to Tai Otoshi if he takes his attacked leg back.

Notice at 53 seconds that your weight is almost all over your right leg: http://imgur.com/ZGnWYnI  Your arms are also being ""left behind"" because of this posture which means there is no strength in them.  This page http://thedifficultway.blogspot.com.au/2011/05/tai-otoshi.html has a great rundown of the throw.  To summarise:  - Keep at least half of your weigh over the leg stretched out in front of uke.  - Don't let your hands and arms get left behind you.

judo,35shkz,enjoyinginternet,8,Wed May 13 03:19:53 2015 UTC,"My perception, as someone who was born in a western culture, is that people here see a black belt as the end goal.  As you say, Shodan means 'first step'.  Most westerners do not see Shodan as a first step, they see it a mark of mastery.  They want it to take a long time and to be exclusive.  In a way, a black belt has a different meaning here."
judo,35shkz,gentlemanofleisure,3,Wed May 13 05:40:09 2015 UTC,"It's a cultural thing. In the US, they see black belts as a sign of mastery - in the East, black belt is like an understanding of the basics.   I'm Korean myself, and my Korean friends (who don't do judo) assume I'm awful since I'm still a brown belt, and it's common to see middle school black belts who've trained for 2-3 years. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Korean dojos in the US do that anyways to meet the expectation of the parents, especially if they're not part of the USJA/USJF.   I should also note, this is why it's unfair to compare a judo black belt vs a BJJ black belt vs a TKD, Karate, etc because the expectation of that rank can be completely different for these arts based on their cultural background."
judo,35shkz,onehungrybear,2,Wed May 13 05:46:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I mean, TKD's black belt got really easy attain mainly because of the commercialism. But in Judo, ""shodan"" and philosophy behind it is pretty clear. And I sort of feel like adhering to it is respecting the original idea.    I grew up in both Eastern and Western culture by the way, and I don't feel this is just coming from the cultural difference. Cultural difference does play a role, but I think there's more behind it.      Also, I'm sort of surprised that IJF did not establish more of a common expectation for kyu and dan. Let's say in case of TKD, Kukkiwon makes it clear the minimum years students need to practice to move on, and while it varies from country to country and instructor by instructor, but it's not as extreme as 1-2 years for black belt in one country and 6-7 (or even 8, it seemed) years in another.   But I guess it's because what matters in Judo is how you do in a match than the belt itself. Belt system matters less at the end. I mean, I can see where things are coming from, and I don't have a great thing against it. I just personally like to stick to an original version, thought, style and whatnot, not just for Judo but for everything. If I had a choice between two, I would've chosen Japanese path, not because it's a lot quicker to get a black belt, but Judo's from Japan. But it's just my preference."
judo,35shkz,onehungrybear,1 point,Wed May 13 08:01:30 2015 UTC,"I think you kind of answered your own ""question"" there. The key is that in certain martial arts, like TKD, there is an organization that dictates, at an international level, what the expectations are for a particular rank. With enough control you could enforce that philosophy worldwide. But, as you say, it doesn't seem like the IJF does that. Personally, that's nice - I think it de-emphasizes the importance of rank."
judo,35shkz,Kosoto_Gake,3,Wed May 13 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"I still see a black belt in the West as someone who has 'got the basics' but it is rather a different interpretation of 'basic'.  Over here a black belt usually means you have a rough idea of almost all judo techniques, a basic understanding of kuzushi and a few throws you can hit regularly - none of that equals mastery."
judo,35shkz,Geschichtenerzaehler,5,Wed May 13 10:02:16 2015 UTC,"When Judo came to the west in the early 20th century, people simply noticed, that the Japanese instructors wore black belts. Thus the black belt was seen as the belt of a master in the West.  The further subdivision of the kyu grades (probably introduced by the influental Mikinosuke Kawaishi) strengthened that impresson perhaps.  Nowadays it is considered ""common knowledge"", that a black belt is supposed to be a master in the west. Thus some federations put rather demanding conditions in place to acquire such a rank. Usually one has to go through 6 exams from white belt to black belt, there's often a minimum age and minimum time gap between the exams  (6-12 months between kyu grades, 1 or more years between dan grades, the higher the more), sometimes competition points are necessary as well. All this to make sure, that the wearer of a black belt lives up to the expectations of the public (the DJB dan exam guidelines actually say something along those lines)."
judo,35shkz,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed May 13 05:34:06 2015 UTC,"The big disadvantage of our ""slow grading system"" is,   that students do not grow and learn further, when they reach shodan with the existing belt colours being ""black"" from shodan to godan. If there were different colours for shodan, nidan, sandan, yondan and godan they would give more effort, to reach the next step (dan). Rokudan is so far away, that they dont even try to go for the next steps, when they are shodan. Another big disadvantage of the slow system and the same black colour from shodan to godan is, that youth plus competition (shiai) plus kata (form) doesn't go hand in hand. Good competitive Judoka go fast to black belt (between 15 and 18), do their very best in competition but mostly dont further advance in ranks (they stay shodan or nidan until 30) and when they are finished with sport judo, they quit and a lot of experience is lost.   Said this, Dan and high ranks were always an instrument for hierarchy, authority, influence, status etc. and thats quite the same in Japan and in the West.  In my opinion the best system would be: white for beginners (up to blue belt), brown for advanced (brown belt to sandan), black belt for teachers (4th dan to 7th dan) and kohaku belt (red and white) as a honour belt (8th dan) Promotions up to sandan all through batsugun in shiai plus nage no kata and katame no kata. For yondan (black belt) you have to do a teachers/instructors degree because good Judo or success in competition doesnt produce a good teacher. As it was in the very old days, when you got the teacher certificate and the secret rolls of your school ;.)  ."
judo,35shkz,JoeDwarf,2,Wed May 13 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"I believe in Japan, coloured belts are for kids and then only a couple (brown and sometimes also green).  For adults, it is white or black and as black is a beginners rank the belt colour is pretty meaningless.  This focus on a specific outward sign of rank here is why I believe many people stop.  If they could get a different colour at nidan, they would probably be more inclined to try.  In kendo, nobody wears any indication of rank and kyu is mostly for kids.  Nobody in Japan thinks you're serious about it until 4th dan, nobody considers you to be a sensei until 6th dan.  From 6th dan there are teaching ranks, renshi, kyoshi, hanshi that correspond to experience at 6, 7 and 8 dan respectively."
judo,35shkz,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed May 13 17:06:28 2015 UTC,"I posted this a view days ago:  ""The ""traditional way"" would be more a darwinistic approach - survival of the fittest. You go to shodan (advanced beginner) within two years and then you have two times a year a promotion shiai (red and white). You went through the ranks not based on knowledge AND not on time (very short minimum requirements) - by a line up of nidan, sandan, yondan etc. If you beat all ""of the next step (dan)"", you are going to the next rank (batsugun - instant promotion). You can be yondan (4th dan) at the age of 21 (with some remarkable exceptions, who were godan at the age of nineteen). Yondan is also the very first rank, when you are recognized as a teacher/instructor (sensei). As a sensei you also can say something and discussing Judo (mondo) but you can not give lectures (kogi).""  quote:  This focus on a specific outward sign of rank here is why I believe many people stop.

judo,35shkz,JoeDwarf,1 point,Wed May 13 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this approach for two reasons, one philosophical and one practical.  The practical reason is that due to size/strength it is very difficult to make a fair match-up in judo for this style of promotion, especially in smaller jurisdictions.  The philosophical is that a promotion test should be about displaying a certain level of judo, not just about being able to beat the other guy.  In kendo, promotions are based on demonstration matches with the other candidates, which is easier to organize because weight, height and even sex aren't that relevant in kendo.  The aim of the match is to demonstrate that your kendo has the attributes we are looking for at that level.  Of course you must be able to score upon your opponent, but it is not a match, and both sides can pass if they show the right qualities.  However you can also fail if you do not score in the proper manner.  We test up to and including 8th dan in kendo.  Pass rate for 8 dan in Japan is under 1%.  Putting it into judo terms, that person should not pass shodan if all he used were his physical attributes to beat the other guy.  Faster/stronger is irrelevant.  Did he use kuzushi?  Did he create opportunities?  Did he recognize opportunities when his opponent made a mistake?  At higher ranks there would be other things to look for.  If you are going for an instructor rank, you should have a certain dignity and elegance to your movement.  You should look like a good example for your students.  Etc.  In kendo we see lots of people failing at yondan because that is the first rank where we are looking for things other than nice technique and good movement.  I think it should be the same way in judo.  Perhaps it is - I am only shodan in judo and so I don't have too much insight into the processes above me."
judo,35shkz,fleischlaberl,2,Wed May 13 22:14:38 2015 UTC,"Before 1964 there were even no weight categories in Judo, only ""rank categories"" like brown belt, shodan, nidan, sandan, yondan divisions. In 1964 they changed to  light, middle, heavy and open weight. In the old system you had to adopt your style of fighting depending which opponent you have so technique was much more important than today, where the fighters in their categories all have about the same weight (exception is heavy weight). Maybe go back to the ""middle way"" would be the most interesting to heave the light, middle and heavyweight. 50 years ago it was light - 66kg, middle -80kg and heavy +80kg und open unlimited.   Judo is not a pure technical martial art and strength and physique is important. If you have not the top physique you have to improve your technique to advance and Judo gives you the opportunity to use the strength and weight of your opponent to beat him. If you cant, your technique is to weak or your fighting spirit, your character, mind etc. It should be impossible for a physically exceptional strong athlete to beat nidan and sandan only with brute force. As you can only teach if you are yondan and higher, a very athletic Judoka wwith poor technique should not rise via competition/shiai and batsugun (instant promotion) to the rank of a yondan/instructor/teacher. It never was possible - even Geesink with 6'6'' and 265lbs had to have some decent technique to win the Olympics open weight category in 1964.  ."
judo,35shkz,JoeDwarf,2,Thu May 14 12:19:13 2015 UTC,"Of course a higher dan should be able to defeat an unskilled opponent but shodan is not unskilled.  Let's be realistic here, an exceptionally physically strong, actively competitive shodan is going to give nidan or sandan people fits and it's the combination of skill, speed and strength that does it.    Do you really think we should reward people with dan based on their strength and fitness?  IMO dan should be a technical rank.  Here in Canada where the test is waza and kata demonstrations along with a written test I think it is insufficient - you need to be able to execute your waza against a resisting opponent, and also there are aspects to judo that you can't judge unless you see someone's randori or shiai.  However I don't think you should be required to smash all comers.  I think it's a perfectly legit thing for a knowledgeable and skilled older candidate to be yondan and still lose to a young, fit, active competitor who is shodan or nidan."
judo,35shkz,fleischlaberl,1 point,Thu May 14 15:14:09 2015 UTC,"Thats only because of your slow grading system. As I said, in the old japanese promotion system you could be Godan with 24 and so successful fighting and grading goes hand in hand. If your Judo is sloppy, you would get to sandan simply because you cant win against a line up of nidan (at the age around 20 ...). Its just that now in our slow system, the slow promoted teachers/instructors, who are nidan and sandan wouldnt accept a fast promotion of the youngsters, because they give the syllabus and time and age restrictions.   I never said, that you should compete as an ""old one"" against the youngsters, cause in the old promotion system you go via red and white tournaments  as far as you can go until you are 24 or 26 and if you reach yondan or even godan you can prolonge as a teacher/instructor. If you couldn't do this, you can not teach, cause you failed your test an eliminative and selective and pragmatic process.  Whats the fastest way and timeframe in your country to become godan? In my country its a combination of contest points and exams and you can be godan at 29 and one Judoka I trained with did exactly this. But its sad, that many excellent Judoka even at an international level doesnt rise up the ranks quickly. Its really no big effort to learn the different  kata up to yondan, if you have well rounded Judo (and if the ""kata experts"" doesnt take them self tooo seriously ....)  ."
judo,35shkz,JoeDwarf,1 point,Thu May 14 22:06:10 2015 UTC,"Nationally (Canada) it is the same as you, minimum age for godan is 29.  However, time to shodan varies by region and dojo in our country, as some impose time in grade restrictions at kyu levels.  In my dojo we can't challenge for shodan until 8 years experience minimum.  If you started as a kid you could get that shodan young enough to still make the 29 year old godan.  Having said all that, I think you should be able to start at any age and advance.  And I still maintain that dan ranks should be about demonstrating judo appropriate to that level, not necessarily being able to beat everybody ranked lower than you."
judo,35shkz,fleischlaberl,1 point,Thu May 14 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"I do understand your arguments and of course a given dan rank should be able to demonstrate judo at his level and also that someone, who came later to Judo as a 30 or even a 40 year old should be able to go to a teachers level (yondan).

judo,35shkz,dave_attenburz,2,Sat May 16 13:19:10 2015 UTC,"Conversely I've practiced with a japanese 1st dan and was surprised that his judo was a bit shit.   It means different things in different places and that's ok, so long as people recognise the difference."

judo,35shkz,TewsMtl,2,Thu May 14 22:54:31 2015 UTC,"Another point that I can't see mentioned here is the procedure to get a black belt.  In France, a sensei with a diploma from the national federation can deliver up to a brown belt. To get a black belt, you need to demonstrate your judo in front of a jury composed of 3 4th dan and higher.   This contributes to make a ""wall"" that gives the western ""skillful aura"" to black belts. However, shodan is a new start in France too, but this is acknowledged only by people that went through the process. For me somehow, my white belt was the beginning of my training and my black belt was the beginning of my study. ""You need to get out of the forest to see the mountain"" kind of thing.  And despite the culture, I've personally seen a guy get a black belt after 2 years, which seems to indicate that the rules don't necessarily delay the awarding of a black belt.  Sorry for any broken English."
judo,35shkz,nearlydammit,1 point,Wed May 13 21:35:36 2015 UTC,I am training 3 times per week every week for the last 1.5 years and I really believe I still legitimately suck at most techniques and I still haven't even learned half of them!  I mean Shodan in Japan might mean starting but I assume it expects you to know all techniques at least (and their names) no? Even at a basic level.  Otherwise why even have white belts. Just start Judo with a black belt directly.
judo,35shkz,immune2iocaine,1 point,Wed May 13 10:50:51 2015 UTC,"I have no real sources for this, other than I asked a similar question of my instructor a good long while back.  He told me when he visited the Kodokan, he found our (US) Shodan rank was roughly equal to their Sandan in terms of general skill, but that above Sandan it evened out considerably, and a person's Judo above that level was really down to experience, athleticism, and natural personal ability.    Of course there are exceptions, but if you took 20 random Shodans from the US and sparred them against 20 random Sandans from Japan, the fights would come out roughly evenly.  This isn't to disparage their training or ability, only to say that their progression is structured differently than ours is.    Basically, they might take 1 year to get to Shodan, but then take 6-10 more getting their next 2 ranks. Where here, our progression doesn't hit that dramatic slowdown, we just have a lot of time ""in-grade"" at each rank, and move up more slowly overall.    Overall, an individual's Judo is going to be a product of some combination of natural ability * quality of instructor * athleticism * time-on-mat.  A fit, natural born athlete training 12 months under an Olympic coach is going to be better than an out of shape person who has been training twice as long under a ""normal"" coach, obviously.  So long as you're not comparing extreme cases in any of the first 3 though, time-on-mat is going to be the biggest determining factor assuming all the rest is more or less equal.   TL;DR: we take 6 years to get to roughly the same place they take 6 years to get to, ability wise. We just call it different things along the way."
judo,35shkz,judokalinker,1 point,Wed May 13 15:18:59 2015 UTC,"In the US, I've seen 4-6 years a lot more common than 6-8 years to get a black belt."
judo,35shkz,kraegarthegreat,1 point,Wed May 13 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"As a westerner (Canadian), I can say that on average we are all pretty lazy. Most clubs don't train very much or very hard. While in Japan they will have judo EVERYDAY. So if you need say 1000 hours for shodan for the average person, they get there a lot faster. The shortest time I have seen a shodan in Canada was 3 years (team mate of mine). I got mine in 5 but then again I started pretty young.  As a result of us being lazy and not training very hard or frequently I would say that we don't have as effective learning per hour anyways. The infrequency of practice reduces this quick growth you could see in Japan or another country."
judo,35shkz,Tarygaryen,1 point,Thu May 14 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"There are probably many reasons for this and most are valid. It's my understanding that the colored belts here in America (yellow, orange, green, and then brown before black) are not the norm in Japan. So we have basically extended the time it takes to become a black belt but created landmarks on the road to it. I think the biggest priority should be to make sure that all things equal, these individuals are on the same level skill wise.  On a somewhat related note, when you contrast Judo or any other martial art with BJJ it seems like there is a big paranoia on their end about becoming a ""McDojo."" Black belts in Judo take an extremely long time to obtain and while they are quick to point out how ""easy"" or short it is to become a black belt in BJJ, they are actually the exception in the MA community and not the norm."
judo,35shkz,That_Stinky_Gi_Guy,-3,Thu May 14 20:15:15 2015 UTC,You pretty much nailed the reasons: commercialism and misperceptions of what a black belt represents.

There should be faster promotions via shiai like in Japan or only teachers (yondan etc. ) should have a black belt. In Japan you can be 4th dan via red and white shiai before your 21th birthday. This would also be a more realistic approach and a darwinistic selection. Today there are nidan, who never won a single fight in competition and do some ""dance kata"" for shodan and nidan. A shodan said to me before the fight in state championships: ""Don't go rough with me, I only need the fighting points for promotion ...""  ."

You should be fluent (to have the words at your tongue without even thinking) in a language, to call it ""my language"" and I am far away to be fluent in english. But I can read very fluently and understand even complicated texts.  To Shiai: ""randori"" is ""free gripping"" but many misunderstand randori as a pseudo shiai - which it isn't. Everybody likes to do randori with me, even the 15 year old kids, because its fun to toss around a dude with 120kg and get thrown by.  ""shiai"" is to test together and if you want to test your Judo, you have to do shiai ...  ."

Aikido is completely shit, it's all choreographed and has no benefit to any kind of fighting. Some people may take offence to that but it's the truth.   Having said that, if you don't want a combat sport and want the sort of martial art lifestyle then aikido would be perfect. Just don't expect to be able to defend yourself."

I doubt an aikidoka could do anything and I've seen nothing to prove otherwise.   Someone who focuses on kata no, someone who solely does kata with no randori will always be at a disadvantage to someone who does."

EVERYONE feels like that on the first day of Judo (and well beyond their first day, for some of us.)  Training with a room full of large, athletic blackbelts means you're learning the skills and the physical/mental toughness necessary to hang with physically and technically superior fighters. Would you rather learn the skills necessary to deal with smaller, weaker and clumsier people? If so, why?  You have a great opportunity here to become a very accomplished Judoka, but it needs a serious gut check. I suggest you harden up and keep going, because, if not, you're going to regret it."

It shouldnt matter but I can't turn my Japanese side off)There was also an overly aggressive dude who had a couple of classes, height and strength on me who resisted partner practice with his full strength.

judo,35sxik,newhoza,2,Wed May 13 21:05:26 2015 UTC,"There can be an element of that, but it varies hugely from club to club. Some places fall victim to this ""boys club"" mentality. Honestly, it only hurts themselves. Unfortunately some places are not able to identify that they have this issue.   Our club, for example, is actively trying to engage women and draw them in to the sport. We have taken steps to attempt to discourage and down play ""boys club"" mentality that can arise, use safer more inclusive language, provide clean facilities for both genders, and things like encouraging the use of a rash guard I am sure is appreciated, and so on.   Anyway, good luck. I hope you find what you are looking for whether it be at your judo club or elsewhere. I hope you don't get turned off judo as a whole from a first underwhelming experience."

judo,35sxik,Ahndru27,1 point,Wed May 13 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"A big thing for me was to get past what others thought of me. This was especially the case when I was an awkward youth. I would constantly compare myself to older, more experienced, more talented people and all it did was be detrimental to my own progress. Just run your own race.  It's easier said than done but as soon as I stopped giving a fuck what people thought (like, genuinely stopped caring. Not just saying it, but believing it) I found that I could apply myself so much better. I wish I could give myself that advice 15 years ago!  Grab a friend and go together. It can be great to share the experience. Don't go in assuming you will spend most of your time with your chosen friend though - that way you will both learn nothing. Split up and try to learn from the experienced members. It can be great to have that support come with you, you can debrief after the session and spur each other on.   I'd recommend you stick with it if it still interests you. However, I'd stick with it but with a proviso. The proviso is that unfortunately not all judo dojos, senseis, classes, students, etc are good. A lot are! Maybe even the majority are. But unfortunately not everyone is. I can not speak for the place you have visited, but keep that in mind. Sometimes a place just won't suit you and maybe you have to find a place the next suburb over.   For example, one time I went to a martial arts gym (street wear, not judo) and the instructor announced ""everyone, pull out your knives"". Everyone pulled out an actual knife right out of their back pockets for inspection, straight out of the clothes they walked in with. Most of these guys looked like psychopaths looking to honest-to-god kill someone. Keep in mind, I live in a country where carrying a knife or any concealable weapon is illegal, so this is a bit of a bigger deal than it may seem. I decided that I didn't want much to do with this club and left.  Don't use this as an excuse to quit! If it doesn't suit you, find another place!   Sorry my advice is a bit all over the place. Be confident in yourself, don't worry about what other people are doing. Bring a friend, and ultimately, if the club doesn't suit you go and find another club!  Good luck!"

He has been doing judo for maybe a couple of years tops and he is great. Given that he is a small guy like you he relies on good technique. His technique is better than mine, for sure. He's training with people literally twice his size. We joke that he is doing judo in hard mode, and that spurs him on.   I am sure that body size comes with it's own set of challenges (I'm 6'6"" and gangly like a pool noodle, so I have some different challenges of my own), but with time it won't be as much of an issue. Practice, practice.  Anyway, it can be done! I hope your local judo club is accommodating. If they alienate you and push you away they are only damaging their own club."

I try and attack in hybrid times (they are weird, most people can't clap along to them making it less predictable to them).  I also attended a clinic with the olympic men's team from Russia and they snap their wrists slightly to get the opponent to react and stiffen up slightly and then attack while they are stiff. This works really well.  Another clinic I was at with an olympic silver medalist from japan, she showed a lot of ashi-waza of which her hands were very different. Most people do one hand lift into them, while she does 2 or more, throwing them off. I will try and find a video on it because it is hard to explain.  Then there is the good old PULL HARDER.

judo,35o06f,BurmaJones,3,Tue May 12 05:18:37 2015 UTC,didn't really see the judo fighter throwing many (any?) punches which makes me wonder why did he want to fight a sambo fighter. in a fight where a wrestler is going against a boxer I can see the wrestler still gaining advantage but sambo has its own throws and grappling.

judo,35ok50,dzendian,4,Tue May 12 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"Study kumi-kata strategies, or gripping if you will, there's a lot of material out there. The fighting for grips is called kumite-arasoi, but you won't get a lot of hits searching that. Most just call it 'kumi-kata'.   If you feel that they are blocking by locking your arms they are probably outgripping you. To be able to fit into a throw there needs to be an opening, dominating the gripping sequence usually opens up that opportunity. Ask your sensei for help on the matter. It's a good idea to create a strategy, like; if they grab your left arm, you do this, if they grab your lapel, you do this, etc."
judo,35ok50,Ryvai,3,Tue May 12 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"Use your weight and use the leverage of your legs. Stay upright in posture and also with loose arms. You dont have to ""walk hard into them"".

I take a (any) grip and look, where we go. If I concentrate on something its my COG and my legs and to stay upright and sometimes my breathing. If you are taller and heavier than your opponent (and stronger) he simply can not stay in a static posture if you move. He has to follow. Most of Judo is going on from the navel downwards. We are just so focused on our arms, that we forget, where the movement and power is coming from. Give it a try and forget the arms in randori and also forget strategy. Nothing to lose, if you do randori twice or three times a week. If it doesnt work after three weeks, go back to your usual.  ."

Average class height, I'd say is like 5'6-5-8'.  Average weight is about 165-180 lbs.  I meant that I'm bigger than most of the class.

As a yellow and an orange belt you have some throws and have the naivity of a beginner, as a brown belt you have gone through that confusions and a lot more experience and stability/ balance.  Give it a try to move your opponents via your bodyweight and focus on balance. When you start with this, you don't have the total controll because its new to you and also a little chaotic. But ""ran dori"" means lit. ""taking the chaos"" ;-) Its more like a flow of movements and with more experience you will see and feel the openings for throws and combinations and close the distance. You then also know  how to use the locked arms of your opponents to your advantage.  ."

Ask your instructors foe more solutions, stiff arming is a big enough issue (especially at the beginner level) that most people have their own good tips and tricks."

But its a little bit a mechanic approach and we shouldn't forget, that two bodies are moving together and our own COG is only one part of the movement of tori and uke. In ""Essence of Judo"" Kyozu Mifune gives a very interesting explanation ""what is the very heart of Judo"". Moving like a ball, cause a ball can never fall and always adjusts natural to a situation. If pushed - turn to the side, if pulled - go with it to an angle.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnRl5pEdYHs#t=34m19s  ."
judo,35m0er,Ryvai,2,Mon May 11 23:05:48 2015 UTC,"I love the ball reference by Mifune, there's a lot of truth behind that. It all breaks down to the use of your center of gravity, which is called 'seika-tanden'. Shizen-tai is just part of that. If someone drops low, it's feasible to adopt jigo-tai. It's all fluid. Shintai is the movements in all directions, while tai-sabaki is the act or method of turning. All are relative to balance :)"
judo,35m0er,Ryvai,1 point,Tue May 12 06:58:18 2015 UTC,"Thx for your answer Ryvai, that does make a lote of sense.  To seika tanden: Its a concept from TCM, where the dantian is the center/storage/ ""sea"" of ""qi"" = life breath = energy. There are some circles of qi in the body and they speak of flowing qi and blocked qi. It seems that martial arts have adopt this concept and blend the dantien with COG, breathing etc.  http://isshindo.blogspot.ch/2013/12/seika-saika-upmost-most-extreme-tanden.html  ."
judo,35m0er,Ryvai,1 point,Tue May 12 09:43:07 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in the whole Qi stuff but I often refer to seika-tanden as the point in the 'hara' which acts as the center of gravity. Nice article, thanks for posting :)"
judo,35m0er,TCamilo19,2,Tue May 12 14:41:39 2015 UTC,"The Qi stuff is more a narrative approach to understand the human body and mind based on empiric medicine, herbs and some correlative thinking (five phases, yin yang, san bao etc). As a narrative its interesting to me because it has influenced the martial arts and how the old masters describe their system and their techniques - not to have some superhuman power. Its so easy to get lost in single Judo techniques and some kumi kata strategies etc that you forget about the fundamentals like COG (hara), tai sabaki, shin tai , moving in circles, shizen tai, waves, deep breathing, open and calm mind etc. On the over hand there are too many ""masters  and their followers"" in bullshido circles, which have no clue when its gettin serious in kata, randori and shiai.

judo,35iug3,reunitedsune,4,Mon May 11 08:04:49 2015 UTC,"The break falls should be beaten into you and the basic foot movement was getting there.  Just go in fresh like you are starting over and you'll be back into the groove quickly.  A lot of Judo takes practice and time.  And some of the most basic and useful skills are incredibly hard to pick up (eg: knowing where your opponent's feet are without looking down).  Frustration is par for the course anyhow.  When i'm tapped to teach new people break falls, I eventually mention something along the lines of ""This used to be the type of thing that you did only this for a month. When I started, we did the accelerated approach for about an hour.  This version will be faster, but we'll stop once I'm sure you won't hurt yourself"".   This wasn't meant to scare them, but merely emphasize that this is a skill set that is important and you aren't going to get quickly (usually when I said this it was after a lot of failed attempts).  Your body is old. It's going to take a bit longer to heal. You aren't going to be as flexible, strong, or as fast as you think you are.  Pimply face kids half your age are going to be giving you advice on how to do things better.  It doesn't matter if you are there for excecise, philosophy, or a skill set... ultimately it's supposed to be fun.  If you weren't having fun, then let it go (or at least find a different club before going back).  If you were frustrated, give it another shot and slow it down (even if you think you are holding others back... fuck 'em, you've got to have your feet under you before you can dance).  If you quit because you got banged up and you are wary, then breathe deep and jump back in.  You were having fun and that's what is important :D"

judo,35iug3,Ryvai,2,Sun May 10 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"As a white belt your priority should be to become excellent at ukemi as soon as possible. Ukemi kind of seems boring at first but it's incredibly to apply it correctly when thrown and negate most of the damage from the throw. Once you know how to be thrown, it will make you less hesitant to attack in randori because if you get countered you will be confident in your ability to break your fall correctly.    Clean up your diet and also have a meal ready (handful of almonds or a protein shake) waiting after every session - it will help with recovery."

judo,35iogs,dzendian,3,Sun May 10 19:26:19 2015 UTC,"Groundwork can be tiring. I happen to be better at groundwork than throws, so I work it because I'm more confident of my ability to escape pins/submissions and to attack them than I am confident in my ability to not get thrown. I'm not sure though, I feel like the standing game can be just as tiring.  Also, as the usually better ground technician, the person defending is usually expending more effort, I feel. It tires me, but it tires them more.  Interesting point about the racial characteristic. We just moved our club into a new location a year ago that's in a community center in the poorer, blacker part of town. Still no one joins, even though everyone else in the building, virtually, is black. (Literally, all the employees, kids for afterschool program, teens playing basketball.) I don't know why they don't join. Same thing, we're virtually all white and asian, with one kid from Kazakhstan occasionally, and some latinos, I think. We had one black guy who was a black belt instructor for the university club that we work with stop in occasionally. He just moved away, though.  I saw a documentary about a blind black guy who was in wrestling, and ended up transitioning to judo, ended up getting bronze for the US in the paralympics.   Other than that, it seems like it's a white sport in the US. France obviously puts out black guys in the sport, but I feel like they're more racially integrated than we are.  Hadn't thought about that before. Probably just momentum at this point. It's intimidating as a white person to go into a club where everyone is black. It's likewise intimidating for a black person to take up a hobby that none of your friends do and where everyone is white, I guess."

[...] Also, as the usually better ground technician, the person defending is usually expending more effort, I feel. It tires me, but it tires them more.   From what I saw, trying to hold a pin or trying to relentlessly choke someone who could just hold their position... was tiring as hell on the attacker.   Interesting point about the racial characteristic.    I like your points.  I think it may be because in the US, typically being black is stereotyped with being poor(er).  Judo is always on your own dime.  Seems harder to get a poor person to buy a gi (""oh, that'll be at least $80 for one gi"") and pay for judo classes (mine is $40 a month), promotions (brown belt promotion costs $50 with our yudanshai), insurances (why bother getting judo insurance if you yourself are struggling to get health insurance?  My insurance costs $75 for the first year and is $50 each year after.  No monthly payments on this), membership fees (IJF? USJA? USJF?).  Want to compete?  Hope you can afford gas money.  I'm lucky that I'm a software engineer and have money flying out of my ass for all this crap, but I think judo could be nicer and more accessible to poor people... the people that probably need it the most.    I am slightly annoyed that there's such a racial disparity (when you break it down by % of population by race) that the similar figures and percentages of the whole don't translate over to judo's reality and leaves almost no black people.  For 300 people I saw from all over the state of California, I should have seen more than 1 black person.  Actually, I should have seen about 19.  I only saw 1.  ""According to 2011 US Census Bureau estimates, California's population was 74.0% White, 6.6% Black or African American, 13.6% Asian, 1.0% American Indian, 0.4% Pacific Islander and 3.6% from two or more races."" (from wikipedia)."
judo,35iogs,fintip,3,Sun May 10 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"From what I saw, trying to hold a pin or trying to relentlessly choke someone who could just hold their position... was tiring as hell on the attacker.   A scramble where you don't have clear dominance is definitely exhausting--like, trying to secure a choke, that's equally tiring for both parties, and it is indeed very tiring.  But if the choke is pretty much in, then he is fighting the uphill battle, and I just have to make little adjustments to keep it set in. Likewise with the pin; getting into a pin position against a resisting opponent can be exhausting, but once I'm in a pin, I only have to tense up and make little adjustments. Uke has to flail for dear life with everything he's got.  There's definitely a point of diminishing returns. It doesn't always make sense to work the ground attacks. But if I end up with a slightly advantageous position, or if my opponent clearly isn't as skilled as me on the ground, or if he's clearly more skilled than me in tachi waza, or if I'm clearly more athletic than him and we'll tire at different rates... In those cases, it definitely makes sense to attack on the ground."
judo,35iogs,fintip,2,Sun May 10 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"As for race/poverty/etc.; yes, there are costs. Petition to get it in schools, offer a scholarship yourself, get other people together to offer a scholarship, petition the Judo orgs for funds to specifically offer help to impoverished areas, start your own club (or petition your own) to have a sliding scale for payment.   But someone has to absorb those costs.   Keep in mind, though, I'm really poor too. Most of my gis have been purchased used or have been free. We don't have promotion fees (that makes me uncomfortable, btw), and my coach has let me skip paying him when I can't afford it, and has even scholarshipped me to tournaments, used club funds to help pay for hotels for competitors. He runs it completely as a non profit on the side, what he gets he puts back into the club. Insurance is through USJA, I've never heard of having to pay for your own insurance... Is that a USJF standard thing?  My point is, it doesn't have to be expensive. For me, it has been very cheap. I'm leaning more on the cultural explanation."
judo,35iogs,Suey13,3,Sun May 10 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"USJF has a standard annual fee all members must pay and the insurance is built into that cost.  USJA uses the same system, most people just don't know about it."

I've seen quite a few in the boxing gyms I've been a member of and I saw several at the kung fu school I visited, but in 2+ years of BJJ/judo, I've only seen five black people consistently training in grappling, and two of those are no longer training.   Black people in America have a long history with striking arts. Their boxing heritage is legendary, and lots of black folks love TMA-dominated martial arts flicks. Striking arts appeal to them more strongly."

Also, make sure you warm up properly and stretch - work on flexibility on your own time, the stretches in practice aren't really enough to advance in flexibility, just enough for injury prevention in the class. You may have muscle adhesions which makes it easier to pull/injure something so use the foam roller."

judo,35hvm6,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,3,Mon May 11 09:51:03 2015 UTC,"Resistance bands are very good for training for strength in specific movements. Rubber band uchikomi will allow you to practice that pulling strength necessary for good kuzushi.  For overall muscular endurance and grip strength I have to endorse kettlebell workouts. A high intensity interval workout with a kettlebell is the closest I've found to mimicking the muscular fatigue of a hard randori session.   If you need more overall strength and muscle mass to protect your joints, and it sounds like you might, I'd suggest the Starting Strength or Stronglifts 5x5 program.  http://stronglifts.com/  Either one will give you a good template to build some linear muscle. You need to take your time with this, but if you follow the templates you WILL see some phenomenal strength gains.  Good luck"

judo,35hvm6,Vargman,8,Mon May 11 13:54:13 2015 UTC,"Take it easy. Give your body some time to adapt, intense judo training is pretty rough.   Really practice your breakfalls, it might be boring but you'll thank me later. Increase your flexibility, it will seriously reduce the risk of injury. I do some stretch exercises on a daily basis. Don't force it, stretching should never hurt. Increase your general strength. You don't need to go to a gym, do some daily exercises (15min/ day and some stretching afterwards). I do some push ups, squads,... don't forget core strength. You won't turn into the Hulk but it will help.    I don't know if this is the case but you might also reconsider your training partners. Do you get hurt by the same people every time? If so, find someone else when possible. When I do randori with some younger judoka or a lower grade, I throw them in a controlled way and not with full force. Injuries can happen but not on a regular basis."

judo,35hvm6,MDA1912,3,Mon May 11 09:50:34 2015 UTC,"Two things to do that will help reduce injuries.   1) stretch. Stretch everything. Legs, arms, torso, back, ankles, shoulders, neck. Even on non training days. Being limber and flexible is a must when it comes to martial arts in general.  2) strength train. Lift weights if you can, do body weight exercise if you don't have access to a weight room. Not only will the strength help you with your game offensively, but the muscle mass will help with your bodies durability. Feel free to pm me if you have questions about workout structure.   Did I say two things? I meant three.  3) recovery. You have to take care of your body post workout. Stretch, ice, and heat. Ice will help with swelling, heat will increase blood flow which well repair your muscles better. Massage sore muscles to get out any lactic acid or blood that has pooled up. And sleep. Do your best to get at least 8 hours a night. This is the ultimate recovery time for your body."

If you aren't doing enough warmup and stretches then do some before class! This is also a great method of reducing injury.

If you get thrown during randori then take the fall, don't try and resist too much. This is not an easy thing to do, especially as a white as you want to show the rest of the class that you are tough and are giving 100% but honestly no one cares whether you fall over easy, white belts are supposed to fall over.  The same thing goes for doing newaza randori, don't resist the submissions too much and try not to use too much strength and energy. If you get pinned or subbed ask what you did wrong.  I speak from experience here as when I first started Judo I got injured a lot from trying too hard. I gave up for 7 years before coming back to Judo and taking things a bit easier.

Some judoka have the attitude that they don’t need to be very strong in order to be successful. They think that because Judo is a martial art that emphasizes ‘maximum efficiency, minimum effort’ and using your opponents weight or strength against them then to use your own strength is somehow cheating or 'poor Judo'. This is not quite true.  This being said, I think we need to make the distinction between compensating for poor technique with excessive strength and the correct application of strength in the execution of good technique. You need to look at how these different uses of 'strength' can play out depending on the activity, i.e nagekomi, randori, shiai and distinguish between use of strength when learning a technique (always bad), practicing a technique (sometimes bad) and applying a technique in a ""live"" situation (often essential).  Sorry, I realize this did not really answer your question, but think it is a useful place to start thinking about this subject. I'm in work at the moment but will come back later and elaborate a bit more"

judo,35guvq,judokalinker,1 point,Tue May 12 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"I guarantee that numerous muscles in your body are stronger now from doing judo than when you were a novice. Even practicing judo alone will develops muscle, especially in a somewhat competitive club. We often attribute technique as the shining factor in higher grades, but this technique has come about through the development of other attributes such as strength and flexibility of the muscles involved in performing the technique.  Strength also helps you to perform technique better. All other variables being the same except strength, the stronger judoka will be using his strength more efficiently than the weaker one when throwing someone because of having to use less of his able strength."

I think you're far overselling yourself here. No doubt strength helps, but getting a little stronger is probably like 15% of what has improved my game. Technique is definitely more important; I can guarantee this because we had a visiting Israeli olympic team training member here for a few months, weighed less than me, threw the shit out of me.Now we have an Iranian national competitor that weighs less than me has an incredibly sneaky uchi Mata that I've had to spend months learning to defend, also smaller/weaker than me. But we also have a Romanian national competitor who weighs 90~ kilo, and he barely can throw me more than they did. I have thrown him once, and I never threw the Israeli, who was smallest of all.

I cannot even fathom how someone could even reasonably argue they are not.  Try doing any sort of throwing with a pulled back muscle.    You're intentionally and disingenuously shifting the time scope of Carlos13's argument from the moment of the technique from beginning to end to a scope that starts apparently when you lift your first piece of iron and then whenever you finish a technique, years down the line.  Not only that, there's some glossing over the difference between bodybuilding (which is good for hypertrophy but less effective for weightlifting) and weightlifting (which is about power generation but generally less effective at hypertrophy).  We could also get into the difference between compound and isolated exercises and the like to really get into this.

The title question is, ""What is the role of physical strength in Judo?"". One of Judo's two defining maxims is maximum efficiency. The point of Judo is doing as much with as little effort as possible. Increasing strength obviously raises your maximum threshhold, but it has nothing to do with the point of Judo, which is needing less to do more.   OBVIOUSLY Judo, like any activity, won't be possible without muscles, or with an injury that inhibits you from movement. You should go look up the straw man fallacy. I said nothing to imply that that was the case.

judo,35guvq,fintip,2,Mon May 11 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"Kano would described judo like this:   Suppose we estimate the strength of a man is ten units, whereas my strength, less than his, is seven units. Then if he pushes me with all his force, I shall certainly be pushed back or thrown down, even if I use all my strength against him. This would happen from opposing strength to strength. But if, instead of opposing him, I leave him unresisted, withdrawing my body just as much as he pushes, at the same time keeping my balance, he will naturally lean forward and lose his balance. In this new position he may become so weak (not in actual physical strength, but because of his awkward position) as to reduce his strength for the moment, say to three units only instead of ten. Meanwhile, by keeping my balance, I retain my full strength available for any emergency. Had I greater strength than my opponent, I could of course have pushed him back; but even if I wished to push him back, I should first have left him unresisted, as by so doing I should greatly economize my energy.   So he is a 10, I could be 12 instead of 7. Then when I attack, it can be 12 vs 3 instead of 12 vs 10. As long as I am using good technique, there is nothing wrong with being stronger."

During randori I try to use good technique rather than just spazzing (as a bigger guy, control means I don't break my training partners) bit strength will always play a role."
judo,35guvq,pk618,0,Sun May 10 08:31:36 2015 UTC,"""Strength is good. Technique is good. Strength applied through technique is best.""  In an ideal judo world the best is technique applied with an absolute minimum ammount of strenght and force. Why? The first principle of Judo is ""seiryoku zenyo"" = ""best use of mind and body"" = ""minimum effort, maximum efficiency"". So if you use the strength and movement and weight of your opponent with minimum strength and movement of yourself, that would be an ideal judo technique. There are some examples, which come very close to this ideal. With a perfect timed ashi waza (foot technique) you can throw an opponent which is double weight of yours if the opponent is unbalancing himself with bad bodymovements or closing his feet. There are also some techniques like Uchi mata sukashi, where the quick turn and speed of your opponent in Uchi Mata and failing to get his leg between your legs throws himself just with very little adjustment of your leg and minimum work with your hands .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOukoJw25hc  Said this, Judo in Randori and competition is not in an ideal world ;-)  ."
judo,35guvq,fleischlaberl,2,Sun May 10 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"I agree to a point. Maximum efficiency is an ideal I strive for, and I get beaten by smaller people using good technique all the time. But then I think about Kimura doing uchikomi so hard he uprooted trees... then moved on to a bigger tree (classic increased load for strength training). Judo even serves to make you strong as a side effect. Sometimes ""minimum effort"" is still quite a lot of effort. Ashi waza is certainly an area where fines and timing overcome strength (and where the older, slightly out of shape veteran judoka usually make me feel foolish). More power on tap is still a good thing though, even if you aren't depending on that strength to make your techniques work. I just get touchy when weak, untrained people expect a bit of judo will make them able to beat a big guy, especially a big guy who has also trained grappling.  Like you said, ""ideal"" judo almost never happens. But finesse judo applied with athleticism is visible even at the highest levels of competition... where everyone is strong as hell."
judo,35guvq,pk618,1 point,Mon May 11 09:01:52 2015 UTC,"""seiryoku zenyo"" can also be translated as ""best use of mind and body in a given situation"". Some situations need a lot of force to be used best even when you are using best technique.  ""strength"" in Judo is also misunderstood. For some reasons to throw some Judoka is very difficult. First and most important is, that they have good bodymovements (tai sabiki) to defend and that they are always centered (the COG is inside the support). They also can change between loose and tense arms and they move with their COG.  In attacking they have speed and they attack decisive and not half hearted.   Sato, the coach of Yamashita said. ""Yamashita has the balance of an elephant and the quick feet of a tiger"".  Yamashita was by far not the strongiest heavyweight of his time, but Jean Luc Rouge, who could bench press around 180kg, felt helpless.  ."

judo,35guvq,IFeelLikeBasedGod,0,Sun May 10 09:55:47 2015 UTC,"Kyozu Mifune!  Look at his smooth techniques and he his 10.Dan. In Judo the soft overcomes the hard and the weak the strong, the small man the big and the old man the young. Its only a matter of refining the technique to the very best and thats what Mifune sensei did to a perfection. Look at his videos - he tosses around much younger, taller and heavier Judoka and they are no beginners, they are third Dan to seventh Dan. Why would the japanese call Mifune the ""God of Judo""? The Judo before WW II was much better than Judo is now, there are a lot of efficient techniques lost. Even Tokio Hirano said, that its very sad to look at Ruskas newaza (two time olympic champion heavyweight) and Kimura - the legend! - said to Inokuma (gold medal heavyweight 1964) that even at his age of 47 he can beat Inokuma easily and in an interview in the late seventies he said, that Yamashita (9 time all japan champion, gold medalist in heavyweight 1984 and unbeaten in 203 fights) has no good Judo.  Conclusion: A modern judoka training for the olympics wouldn't have a blink of a chance against the 72 year old Grandmaster Mifune, God of Judo! Mifune sensei would defend with sublime shifting body movements and throw with o guruma and sumi otoshi left and right.  P.S.: Only a small group of Judoka in the North of Germany has preserved the original techniques of Mifune and Tokio Hirano. Their Grandmaster Tomelix refuses to send his students to open contests, because the old techniques are so sharp and efficient and dangerous, that it would be a massacre.  ."

He is so good that he awarded himself with hachidan (8th Dan) at age of 46.

judo,35ekpj,davomyster,5,Sat May 9 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on country, federation, club and instructor.  By Country (as far as I know)  As fas as I am informed, in France and Argentinia self defense is part of the Judo curriculum (that includes techniques forbidden in randori and shiai).  In Germany it's really complicated. In Eastern Germany self defense was a must in each exam (as far as I know). This stopped with the re-unification. In West Germany self defense ceased to be a part of Judo exams long ago, only to be re-introduced as an option a few years ago. With most of the local expertise extinct, the DJB now integrates Krav Maga and that German Selfdefense Jujustu stuff (which was originally a mix of Judo, Karate and Aikido) into their Judo curriculum. Most clubs I've seen around here don't practice self defense as part of Judo though.  Some Japanese Police Judo Dojos seem to practice self defense as well.  What Judo actually offers in that regard  There are quite a number of Kata that deal with self defense:  Seiryoku Zen'yo Kokumin Taiiko (Basic atemi, basic defenses)  Kime no Kata (pure self defense kata, uke's attacks are very koryu like though)  Kodokan Goshinjutsu (another set of self defense techniques, complements the Kime no Kata, uke's attacks are more ""modern"")  Joshi Goshinho (self defense for women, evasive movements and other stuff)  Torite no Kata (older selection of forms compiled for police purposes)  Jujutsu  Regarding ""Jujutsu""/""Ju Jitsu""/...  etc.. all the various ways of writing it are just transcriptions of the same japanese words, I'll just use Jujutsu here:  There's traditional Jujutsu. That's what the unarmed and lightly armed fighting methods of the Koryu Bugai (or Koryu Bujutsu),the old (Japanese) arts of war were called. There are hundreds of different schools and each of them has a specific name. Authentic, legitimate koryu schools are not easy to find, especially not outside Japan. Don't confuse other schools with them.  There's western self defense Jujutsu. This is usually a mix of Judo, Aikido and Karate (at least in Germany) and often they are not really good at any of it. There are exceptions of course...  Even worse are the pseudo-traditionalists, that created their own Jujutsu style and adopted sloppy, dumbed down or showy techniques, that were introduced to westerners by amateurs and Japanese showmen 100 years ago. Mix in some stuff from here and there and throw a cool sounding name made up from Japanese words on top. These Jujutsu styles feature ""highly ranked great-grandmasters"" who never put their ""art"" to a real test in their entire life.  Then there's Brazilian Jujutsu, a definitly legitimate martial art, which stems from Judo and puts a great emphasis on ne-waza. To make the confusion complete they often just call it Jujutsu.  Practicing Self-Defense  The biggest problem with self defense techniques such as shown in the video linked by OP, are the training methods. If we limit ourselves to practice such techniques merely in kata, but never use them in randori, it is a lot more difficult to use them in an actual fight."

judo,35ekpj,JIVEprinting,1 point,Wed May 13 01:51:52 2015 UTC,"thanks for the great, informative comment. I've known about the kata for a while and I even asked my traditional Japanese-style Sensei   about it but I just don't see much value in spending a bunch of time on kata, but then again I've only been practicing Judo for a year and a half, so what do I know? I understand why these can't safely be practiced in randori but I was looking at these techniques as tools for stopping a fight before it happens. For example, some bro is shoving you with one hand (it's happened to me several times), trying to intimidate or initiate a real fight, it'd be nice to be able to immediately take 100% control of the situation by putting the aggressor in a wrist lock. Again, I'm no expert so I'm willing to admit that my expectation of the reality of real-world self-defense situations is wrong. In fact, I moved away from Krav Maga because I felt it was too theoretical and we couldn't really practice the techniques 100%."
judo,35ekpj,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sat May 9 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"Kata are among the most misunderstood tools of Judo. Many competitors see kata as something useless. Some think they are rituals, shows, demonstrations or just a dan-exam harrassment.  In truth kata are meant to teach basic movements. Most of them were originally aimed at beginners, not highly advanced dan grades. Also one doesn't practice to do kata, one does kata to practice. In short: Kata are practice methods. They provide more or less foolproof situational templates to practice various techniques or just motoric skills. Of course one shouldn't settle with the kata as the ultimate or final goal of application. Instead kata provide a starting point.  Example: You want to learn Harai Goshi. This works best with a partner eagerly advancing forward with the same foot. That's exactly how it can be found in the Nage no Kata. Uke takes three steps forward and gives tori the opportunity to place his hands properly, exaggerate uke's movement and placing himself correctly for the throw.   Once you've mastered and understood this way to throw harai goshi you can modify the setup, where to step, where to grab etc...  Another example: Second technique in the tachiai of the sotai renshu in the Seiryoku Zen'yo Kokumin Taiiku. Uke takes a swing at tori (yoko uchi), who deflects the strike to the inner side and evades by stepping backwards/turning out. Tori then strikes Uke's face himself. That's one of the most basic self-defense moves you'll find in any Judo kata. Using this basic combination of deflection, evasion and counter strike, it's easy to create a cyclic flow drill where the roles of tori and uke switch all the time. Again: The kata provides the basic template to start with, but it is neither forbidden to go above and beyond nor taking a single form out of a kata and practicing it independently of the rest."
judo,35ekpj,OceanRacoon,1 point,Sun May 10 11:20:36 2015 UTC,"it'd be nice to be able to immediately take 100% control of the situation by putting the aggressor in a wrist lock.    Wrist lock like that is unlikely to work in real life, you don't have proper control of them, there's too much time to wrench out of it or move the rest of their body against you. Also, you'd probably have to go ahead and break it because they might panic and attack you even with it on  Learn boxing or muay thai if you want to be more confident in those sort of situations, knocking a person out with one punch is an amazing ability to have. Your judo should be able to beat most fellers on the ground, as well"
judo,35ekpj,OceanRacoon,0,Sun May 10 17:18:45 2015 UTC,"I have a background in TKD and Krav Maga so I'm not too unfamiliar with striking but I'm more interested in the wrist locks.  I've seen moves like the ones in the video in real life.  Cops are taught some of this and I've seen it applied in real life.  It was the one where they turn his wrist,  bring it to uke's back,  and force him to the ground. It looked like the cop could break the other guy's wrist in a moment's notice and had complete control of the situation. Your input is appreciated!"
judo,35ekpj,OceanRacoon,1 point,Sun May 10 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"That's a hammerlock and it actually targets the shoulder. The reason that has a higher chance of working is because the other guy can't as easily spin out of it once his arm is behind his back, and you're in a dominant position to push him around, onto the ground etc.  The difficulty is getting there in a full on fight where you're not a cop so the guy isn't worried about going to jail by fighting back or the guy is stronger than you"

From what I understand, Kano was very impressed with Funakoshi's teaching and invited him as a guest instructor. I'm guessing their contemporal development contributed to the atrophy of striking in Kano's jujitsu and grappling in Funakoshi's version of Okinawan karate. Why teach a less effective version of what the other guy is teaching when you can focus on your strengths?"

judo,35dqxe,fleischlaberl,2,Sat May 9 09:49:33 2015 UTC,"There is nothing ""weird"" what you are writing - I like your essay a lot!  First:  (quote)  ""Since then I have gone to the other extreme and become so loose that it is also a problem for my training partners. But this experience taught me something critical. Ukemi, or breakfalling, is taught as something Uke (the person being thrown) needs to do to prevent injury to themselves or to Tori (the attacker) when Tori throws them. Ukemi is only really observable after a throw, when Uke hits the mat. I discovered that Uke's contribution to the throw is much more than that. What Uke does in a throw is more than just the break fall. Uke actually participates with Tori's movement before and during a throw.  There is a way you must hold your body in order for a Tori's technique to work. [u]And so Judo throws are not really just a one sided attack that is solely Tori's per se; it is more like a dance movement; both partners must participate with one another for one to successfully throw the other. Both players throw one player. You have to participate to be successfully thrown. Once you can identify what that participation is; then you can refuse to do it with your opponent.[/u] I have found that if I hold my body like a drunk; my opponents cannot throw me easily; because I have turned my mind to my part of the throw; and refused to participate with it. ""    Very good observations! I dont know, if you know, that this ""drunken style"" is deeply rooted in Daoism especially Zhuangzi Daoism.  Quote Zhuangzi 19:  """"When a drunken man falls from a carriage, though the carriage may be going very fast, he won't be killed. He has bones and joints the same as other men, and yet he is not injured as they would be, because his spirit is whole. He didn't know he was riding, and he doesn't know he has fallen out. Life and death, alarm and terror do not enter his breast, and so he can bang against things without fear of injury. If he can keep himself whole like this by means of wine, how much more can he keep himself whole by means of Heaven! The sage hides himself in Heaven - hence there is nothing that can do him harm.""  Burton Watson translation ~  Second:  (quote)  ""This is nothing new.  There is a technique taught in Japanese martial arts called the ""Kiai"" . It's usually translated into English as a ""spirited shout"", but I disagree. Its used as a way to unbalance an opponent emotionally. The standard approach seems to be that you give a short punchy shout; with the intention of unsettling your opponent so that you may gain an advantage over them. You usually do this just before you try an attack. I have a different interpretation of what it means. The characters to write it are ""spirit meet"". I have taken that as meaning ""a meeting of the spirit"". If I Kiai against you; I want you to meet my soul.""    ""Ki Ai"" = 氣合 has a meaning, that even the japanese dont really understand. ""Qi"" is not ""spirit"", ""qi"" is ""lifebreath"" and general ""energy"". There is an old chinese concept, that all life is filled with ""Qi"" and if ""Qi"" is gone, emptied, lost, your life cames to an end. ""Spirit"" is ""shen"" or in japanese ""sei"" like in ""sei ryoku zen yo"" = ""spirit energy best use"". ""Ai"" means blending. If you translate  ""Ki Ai"" as ""blending energy"" you go exactly to the first quotation, which I did: Its very important to understand, that ""best use of mind and body (spirit and energy)"" is not only to use your own body in Judo BUT to use your AND your opponents body (and mind) and movements etc. because in randori/shiai these two energies are ""blending together"", they mix and if you are able to use your own energy and the energy (mental and physical) of your partner/opponent, then you are going to do really good Judo which is effortless, natural, simple, just in time, round, like a ball, like water and so on and you are not distracted by plans, will, concepts, fears, rank etc.  ."
judo,35dqxe,fintip,2,Sat May 9 13:23:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but kind of hard to not just wonder if it's just the ramblings of an emotionally friend brain. Wouldn't mind seeing a video, though.  Being hard to throw isn't difficult. You just lay on the ground, like a truly drunk person. That isn't really skill though. A drunk man may be hard to throw, but he is also poor at throwing. The 'participation' of uke is really that uke is actively trying to throw as well; that's why he is stiff, and when he is stiff. We are told to relax for precisely the fact that relaxing makes us harder to throw and predict, as you rightly notice. We tense up, ideally, only as we engage our muscles for movements into a throw, or as we redirect our force to resist our opponents' attempts at kuzushi. But actually throwing someone with very good balance and reaction time will unfortunately almost always require a lot of strength and stiffness, or successful prediction of their movements before they have made them so that you can counter them effortlessly then.  I'm reminded of the movements of mifune, gliding around, floating. His attacks were effective, though, because of precise timing.  I'm just rambling my thoughts in response, but my point is that being hard to throw isn't that hard; throwing people who are trying to throw you, is. I wouldn't consider your attempted style a success if it only has defensive merit."
judo,35civ7,dzendian,7,Sat May 9 00:10:38 2015 UTC,"Hm, they totally aren't.  In kosoto you have to unbalance your opponent to his back right corner and then you reap (gari) his right leg . Your attacking leg goes across your body, which looks kind of awkward, and reaps towards you. The way I was taught: the reaping motion must be parallel to the line formed by the tip of the toes of your support foot.  In deashi barai, you wait until he has no weight on his foot, and then you scoop it with a sideways sweeping motion (harai). At the same time, you use your hands to unbalance uke in a ""steering wheel"" action."
judo,35civ7,SVPPB,2,Sat May 9 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"Well said. I would add that with kosoto you are taking out the weighted foot, weighted because of your kuzushi to the back corner. With deashibarai you are sweeping the unweighted foot sideways (outside to in), looking to time it just as uke is either stepping onto or off that foot. Steering wheel kuzushi is timed with the sweep."
judo,35civ7,JoeDwarf,1 point,Sat May 9 04:53:41 2015 UTC,Thanks!
judo,35civ7,Ryvai,3,Sat May 9 05:42:31 2015 UTC,"One of the most distinguished differences between the two is the harai vs. gari element and how that is applied. 'Harai' (barai) is like brushing away a very light object, like a feather, off a table. There's no significant weight, it is just moved. In 'gari' there is a reaping motion, like when you hold a bundle of grass in your fist and cut it off with a sickle, abruptly removing it.  The 'de' in de-ashi-barai comes from the verb 'deru', which means 'to depart' or 'departing', sometimes interpreted as 'advancing' but that is somewhat misleading, as de-ashi-barai can be performed on an retreating opponent. So you sweep a leg that is departing, e.g. the weight is either transferred off the leg or the weight is about to transfer onto it, but is swept just before, or even when it is hovering for that matter. There is a misconception that in de-ashi-barai one must sweep the leg sideways. The concept is that the leg is swept before any weight is put onto it, usually this is done in the direction toes are pointing, or sideways.  In ko-soto-gari uke has transferred all or some weight onto the leg and it can no longer be easily swept away like a feather, a reap is necessary, which can be done in many ways. The most effective is to push against the hell of the foot in the direction the toes are pointing, while breaking uke's balance towards his rear. There are plenty of ways to perform this technique.  Hope that helps :)"

Personally, I have a lot of trouble getting the timing right, but they can be amazingly effective and subtle techniques."
judo,35civ7,miraoister,2,Sat May 9 12:57:52 2015 UTC,kosoto is a deeper movement to the rear of the uke.
judo,35civ7,dave_attenburz,0,Sat May 9 07:03:00 2015 UTC,Not relevant. Like the guy above says the difference is between reaping a leg that is holding all of uke's weight and sweeping a leg either just before or just after it has all the weight taken off it.

So the highest ranking sensei and students should be on the same end. Who sits on the sensei side depends on the club and situation.  For example when we host seminars some of the people who normally would be on the sensei side move to the student side in deference to the higher levels of our guest sensei.

To show respect to the others, who are practicing with you, to show respect for the second principle of Judo which is ""jita kyoei"" (lit. ""shining together"" or ""mutual benefit and welfare"" ) and some historical references like Kano or some hiearchical like bowing to your teacher or to the Nisshōki...  Its no big thing and I was first lieutenant and chief of a company of mountain infantriests. So I also have no troubles with authority, where formal authority and skills and organisation and speed of commands and obedience/loyality/trust etc are very important.  But do we need a formal hierarchic ceremony in Judo to start and end every practice/lesson?  P:S.: A society which is based on freedom and equality is the heart of democracy and constitution. ""Equality"" doesn't mean that the citizens are not different, it means that they are equal in foundamental rights and equal in front of the law. So quite contrary ""equality"" is the foundation, that we all can be different and everbody can follow his way of life, as long he doesnt go against the constitution, the foundamental rights and the law (if the law is based on the first and the second ...).  ."

judo,359y7d,fleischlaberl,5,Fri May 8 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I've made a few sketches to show proper 'reigi' during lineup. I must press that this is traditional and being formal about it is not that necessary except some minor points that should be followed. Many countries differ from the Japanese system, especially France. Personally I don't feel the need to be super traditional, the only thing I prefer is to follow example 1 without much hustle.    Example 1: typical line-up  Main points;    Shomen traditionally the area in the opposite side of the entrance. The highest ranking student or sensei sits closest to it in decending order. This line-up is most typical for sensei that are not of high-dan (8-10th dan).  Age is just as important if not more important than grade in Japan. If two are of same rank, age should determine who sits closest to shomen. The 'senpai' is usually of highest grade/age, an exemplary Judoka who is capable of mentoring the lower grades. In some situations this person can be the captain of a team. He/she usually sits closest to shomen. Guests are traditionally sitting at the end, but I've yet to encounter a dojo that enforces this rule. If you are visiting a dojo, it is however considered polite to sit at the end of the line, unless told otherwise by the sensei. At our dojo, we just mingle and bother with this practice. Usually black belts sits with the sensei. here's one example of this type of lineup. At this camp all the black belts who teach at their club gets to sit on that side. Not everyone uses this practice, but I've seen it many places. Of course you only do it if the sensei says so, otherwise follow normal protocol. Special scenario; some countries use 'mon' grades (half-grades) which is a white belt with the color of the rank as a stripe in the middle. This is used for children who are not old enough to practice kansetsu-waza or shime-waza, so their grade is not 'complete', until they come of age. These youngster usually sits after the kyu-rank judoka. This is because it is the person next to you's responsibility to look after you. Children can not be responsible for grown ups. This is also some of the reasoning behind age being a factor. Example; 3.mon (green) sits lower than 4.kyu (orange). I have not seen many countries use this system except for the ones in scandinavia.   Example 2: High-dan line-up with many Judoka  Main points;   The norm is that you need a very high dan grade (7-10th) for it to be acceptable to turn your back towards 'shomen', as it would be disrespectful otherwise. In some cases the highest dan stands in the middle (physically closest to shomen), like in this example, where T. Daigo (10th dan) stands in the middle and the others have 7, 8 and 9th dan, if I am not mistaken. But they are of sufficient rank to have their backs turned towards the shomen. When there are multiple students one has to make several rows. Then the highest ranked/age is usually to the right facing shomen. The rows then continue backwards as shown in the picture example.   Remarks  In my personal opinion this etiquette is very traditional and most places are not that strict when it comes to this. In my dojo the order of kyu ranks are reversed for example, so that the lowest grade sits closest to shomen. I don't mind this at all, but I am painfully aware that it might offend someone if we had a traditional visitor from Japan or I were to visit somewhere it is useful to know how their ways. The reason for the whole shomen/entrance thing is because in Japan it is customary, when visiting others homes for dinner, that the guests sit closest to the entrance and the most senior or of most importance sits furthest away from the entrance. This is because it is considered the safest place to be if there were to come attackers etc. Perhaps even attackers coming into the dojo, the sensei is protected from harm, the whole; 'you have to go through me first' kind of thing. This custom is still practiced today and is useful if one were to visit Japan. Culture is important."
judo,359y7d,Ryvai,3,Fri May 8 14:15:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for such a detailed reply Ryvai. Can I ask you a question and please don't take this the wrong way. You have a lot of knowledge on Judo especially for a blue belt. Is there a specific reason you have never graded higher?
judo,359y7d,judokalinker,3,Fri May 8 15:07:28 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. The time-in-grade requirements are strict in this club, I am not allowed to progress faster unfortunately. Knowledge is not rewarded, time is. I don't necessarily agree with that point of view, but that's how it is at the moment. The 'Law of Jante', comes to mind. I've studied Judo theory and history for 4 years and traveled a bit. One tends to pick up a thing or two, it just sticks to me because I'm passionate about it I think :)"
judo,359y7d,Ryvai,1 point,Fri May 8 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"The ""traditional way"" would be more a darwinistic approach - survival of the fittest. You go to shodan (advanced beginner) within two years and then you have two times a year a promotion shiai (red and white). You went through the ranks not based on knowledge AND not on time (very short minimum requirements) - by a line up of nidan, sandan, yondan etc. If you beat  all ""of the next step (dan)"", you are going to the next rank (batsugun - instant promotion). You can be yondan (4th dan) at the age of 21 (with some remarkable exceptions, who were godan at the age of nineteen). Yondan is also the very first rank, when you are recognized as a teacher/instructor (sensei). As a sensei you also can say something and discussing Judo (mondo) but you can not give lecture (kogi).  Summary: If you dont go through the ranks via shiai and batsugun to 4 Dan, you only have to train Judo and shut up ;-)  Draeger has some notes on traditional ranking system and promotion in ""Judo Training Methods: a sourcebook""."

judo,352alk,wookiejeebus,7,Wed May 6 15:30:30 2015 UTC,"I can't believe more- or should I say ALL- on here aren't getting behind this movement 100%.  Not being able to touch the lower half of your opponent's body isn't grappling- it's a disgusting, stupid, worthless bastardized version of what heretofore had been the greatest grappling system on the face of the earth.  The reasons for the ban on touching below the belt are strictly due to an incredibly shortsighted overreaction vis-a-vis Judo in the Olympics (or, as I like to call it, the Judo that is practiced by 1 out of every 100,000 Judoka).  There is no sound, practical basis for this ban; rather, it was a move made to forcibly differentiate Judo from Wrestling, which itself had just been banned from the Olympics.  That is an absolutely vile rationale for neutering an almost perfect art; an EGREGIOUSLY horrendous decision that has- and will continue to have- an extremely detrimental effect on our sport in the long run.  Simply put: the prohibition on leg grabbing (oh- sorry- leg TOUCHING) is literally insane.  Oh and btw- to those on here who profess the ""no one's stopping you from practicing the banned techniques""-mantra (thank God it's only a small portion of redditors), I say this: stop living in a fantasy world.  Obviously one ""can"" do whatever one wants-- but the fact is that 99% of Judo clubs belong to their nation's Judo association, with said association seemingly ALWAYS being IJF-affiliated.  As such, all contests fall under the IJF ruleset, which means no touching below the belt.  THEREFORE, people belonging to a club which is under the IJF's auspices don't/won't train banned techniques, since the use of said techniques in competition will get them- you guessed it- BANNED.  So no, sorry, hate to tell ya-- but the IJF holds incredible, unrelentingly powerful sway over the world of Judo- and their incomprehensibly awful BLANKET prohibition on all (fucking ALL!!!) lower-half techniques means- on a realistic, practical level (rather than a wishful, seemingly pretend one) that every single one of those lower-half-of-the-body attacks will soon go the way of the Dodo bird.    But lo and behold- along comes an organization that simply aims to have Judo be played as it always has been and was always meant to be, with no phony/false/absurd/needless/senseless/disgustingly misguided ban(s) on what are, after all, not only highly effective but also NATURAL, INSTINCTIVE Waza-- and yet they are receiving such tepid support on this board.  I don't get it.    Basically, freestyle Judo IS Judo-- as opposed to the IJF's pale, tepid, half-assed imitation-- so why aren't we going over to the good guys in droves?  Thank you Steve Scott for bringing some semblance of sanity back to our game.  Personally, I hope your organization Morote-Garis the FUCK out of the IJF."

Sure, there was some errors here and there, but to say that you lack skill is unreasonable. The bent over position you demonstrate is very common in bjj and props for trying to implementing some Judo towards that stance. However if I were to criticize, I'd point out that it's more effective to pull the opponent forward without pulling yourself towards him, it leaves you vulnerable. I also think it's best to use an lapel grip for tai-otoshi in the bent-over position. If one gets to grab their back, harai-goshi is probably more effective, lifting and reaping. This is because you might miss with the blocking leg and he can counter easily. Another point is weight-distribution, were you claim to bring the weight over to the blocking leg. Personally I think this is a mistake, as the distribution is usually 50/50 or 30/70, the majority of the weight being on the leg that is not blocking, failing to do so leaves you wide open for tani-otoshi or ko-soto-gari/gake counter :)"

I tried to be a gentleman about all of this and I'm labeled as an ""Illegitimate Black Belt"" and ""Immature""  I challenge each and everyone of you to make a video and post it here so that we can all see how perfect you are.  Some of you may be very good, and I'm sure the ones that are, were not the ones so quick to launch daggers.  Anyway, continue on with picking this apart so that you can feel better about yourselves.  I've wasted enough time with some of you, time to get back to the real world.  For those that question the legitimacy of my black belt, feel free to private message me and we can settle that easily.  These attitudes are the reason why we can't keep Judokas in the states.  Get off of your pedestals."

judo,351mnw,fintip,3,Wed May 6 21:33:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying what you're doing can't work, but in all honesty, that is one ugly tai otoshi. If you can find one instructional for tai otoshi that looks like yours from any other reputable teacher, I'll eat my hat, but color me skeptical. That is a long ways from orthodox, and just looks... lazy... at best...  Also, you didn't really teach the move. You just said 'lift, backstep, throw' 3 times, while doing it 3 times. No educational information imparted...  Personally, I find that kuzushi to be pretty stale and not real-world applicable; my opponent usually won't let me just lift them up. But kuzushi is obviously a more complicated subject, I suppose."

Two differences that make it not comparable: Tori looks super leaned over and easy to counter (bad) and has his right knee bent to a near-90* angle (good).  The second one is certainly more like NavyRN's, but it still looks like bad tai-otoshi. It almost looks like it deserves a different name than tai otoshi. Tori does not 'drop' at all, no elevation shift. He just puts himself in the way and then pulls uke forward. If Tori wasn't wearing a belt, there's no way I would assume he was a shodan.  Am I wrong? Possibly, on this video. But even that video is more passable than NavyRN's."

judo,351mnw,BabycakesJunior,1 point,Sat May 9 09:25:28 2015 UTC,It's just all that about his black belt being legit etc. It just makes the thread so toxic :p
judo,351mnw,fintip,1 point,Sat May 9 09:51:01 2015 UTC,"The guy that founded and organizes our club was a brown belt 5 years ago when he started it. He got his black belt sometime in the 3 years after that. He's very short, not super athletic, and in his 50's. In randori, as I'm more athletic, young, taller, and just naturally physically more gifted than he is, I typically throw him several times. I usually hold back, because it feels disrespectful, and focus more on working moves I'm not as good at executing in randori.  I still 100% have no question that he deserves his belt, though. He truly understands the theory, can teach it soundly, and can give an adequate demonstration of any technique I've ever seen him demonstrate. Most of the time, other, more skilled (and athletic) black belts teach our classes. He's not even a great teacher, frankly (though he is a great organizer, and a great guy). But he does the moves correctly enough, often enough, that I have no shame in training under him.  When I see someone that cannot do a move, in a way that shows technical understanding of the physics underlying the throw, even with zero resistance, I really can't help but raise an eyebrow and hold serious reservation when they also have a black belt wrapped around their waist.   That being said, I wasn't talking about NavyRN when I said that last line you are referring to; what's more, I worded that line very carefully.   If Tori wasn't wearing a belt, there's no way I would assume he was a shodan.   I'm talking about one of the videos you showed, the non-german one. And what's more, I don't say 'he doesn't deserve a black belt'; I don't have the qualifications to say who does or does not deserve one. I'm just saying, it surprises me, and in my (admittedly limited) understanding of Judo, his technique doesn't appear to me as shodan level.  I understand being sensitive to someone else going through something painful, and it shows very well that you're a kind person, but would it be better if none of us were willing to talk about the fact that his technique was very poor, and out of fear of hurting his feelings danced around the topic? It is an insult and an embarrassment to all of us when someone wears a black belt that doesn't deserve it. You can wear any belt below that, and the tolerance people will give you is much, much higher for mistakes, and you would likely find nothing but constructive criticism. But if you're sticking a black belt around your waist, I expect you to know some damn fundamentals well enough to do a demonstration without multiple glaring errors. When you wear a black belt, people have the right to demand that of you. No one is free from questioning simply because it is embarrassing.  My $0.02."

judo,351mnw,judokalinker,2,Sat May 9 00:00:49 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, his tai-o looks beautiful. He gets deep, low, sticks the blocking leg out sufficiently far such that uke can not just walk around, the kuzushi is pulling tori forward more than up, etc. Perfect comparison to show why yours is terrible.  For easy comparison:  Kuzushi  Kake  ^ In this throw of yours at 52~ seconds, tori does not even come off the ground. It's like he just spins politely around you. This would be trivially easy for tori to just step around. If I threw a tai-o like that for a video like this, I would have refilmed it or edited it out. It's a terrible illustration of what tai-o is supposed to be. And, frankly, any shodan should be doing this throw correctly at least when demonstrating. Pulling it off in randori, sure, we're not all Jimmy Pedro, but instead of just saying 'yeah, sorry, it wasn't the best, I know', you're actually defending it?  Doesn't look good for you."

There it is.  Challenge accepted and delivered.  Again, let me know how that hat tastes.  Oh, and please post your own video of you demonstrating the throw so we can also see the comparison."
judo,351mnw,Ryvai,1 point,Sat May 9 02:51:22 2015 UTC,"I still maintain that my point was your throw wasn't just ""not world class"", it was fundamentally wrong. The point was I was looking for you to post an instructional video showing a tai otoshi that looked like yours (with one characteristic of said tai otoshi being a completely failure to have the tripping leg project out in front of tori, and another characteristic being a failure to lower the body), which you absolutely failed to do. My whole point is your throw looks nothing like the one Jimmy Pedro did in the ways that it matters. Look at your knees and his knees; his are bent almost 90, yours are barely off of a 180. I just kind of assume you must have really bad knees or something, which sucks if true. But if so, you probably shouldn't be demoing a move you're physically incapable of doing.  And I train privately with a buddy on Mondays, I'll try to get it filmed then. I would be training tomorrow morning, but I'm sick at the moment. I'll be glad to deliver, count on it."

I get it, it would definitely sting to be getting responses like what you're getting. But there's not much to say, this really wasn't a very good video in any way. No instruction, poor demonstration, and unpassable audio (this just should never have been published for that reason alone, whatever your own opinion of your demonstration is). The mature response to that is to eat humble pie. And as for your challenge elsewhere, I have no problem posting a video of tai otoshi and opening it to critique here. That's actually a great idea; maybe I will do it just to get some feedback anyways. We can always improve our technique.

But frankly, that tai-o demonstration had me wondering the same thing. Anyways, a black belt is just an imaginary thing, and it doesn't mean the same thing everywhere, so in the end, whatever. I just make a mental note that I'm not too sure about that guy's quality from my limited perspective here, and move on.  What can one do if one does see someone who claims to be a black belt but doesn't seem to have the chops to back it up? I just ignore it, but it's hard to fault someone for wanting to call someone else out who potentially could be watering down the quality of what that claim means. Talk is cheap over the internet, though.  I guess what I'm saying is, if my rank was questioned after posting a demonstration video, I would be embarrassed and worried that something was wrong with what I had been taught, I think, and/or I would feel the need to point them to other videos to decide for themselves (I have several competition videos that anyone can watch).  I totally get that this would be very hard to stomach, like I said. But humility is unfortunately the only mature response here. I don't think he's been that bad in this thread, to be fair (""a giant FUCK YOU"" might be a glaring exception).   But the whole thing--video, thread, and responses--is a little strange."

I only watched a few seconds of it though when I was directed there instead of tai-o, no more interest, so I wouldn't doubt he makes other errors--some seem to say he does no commentary on transition to newaza, for instance."

The second throw, your variation for bent over, I recommend instead of grabbing the back or the belt, which really closes the distance, instead nderhooking the shoulder giving you much more space to hit the Tai Otoshi. Honestly hitting the throw that close is essentially a Koshi Waza.  Thank you for posting these videos. I love when other judoka are venture into the jiujitsu community.

Keep in mind that this is not a Judo techniques for Judo video.  This is Judo for BJJ video.  If you paid attention, the video explains that BJJ players start off much different then in a traditional Judo shiai.  There are no penalties for being bent over, arms outstretched in a defensive posture or for stalling.  The next thing you're going to tell me is that it's an illegal throw because of the leg grab."
judo,351mnw,left_star,6,Wed May 6 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"Aside form the poor kuzushi, you make no attempt to follow up on your position at the end of that throw - something which is vital if you are going to try a makikomi style throw in a BJJ environment. Right now you are giving up your back even if you some how managed to land that throw."
judo,351mnw,judokalinker,-1,Wed May 6 13:57:59 2015 UTC,"True you are potentially giving up your back, especially to higher level BJJ players.  This videos are geared for the beginners in BJJ. You and I are just going to have to agree to disagree with regards to the kuzushi.  I've hit this throw countless times in tournaments and randori/rolling.

What I should have said that if someone with little takedown experience performed the technique as you have described, they are going to get their back taken every time. Perhaps you can do the technique well, but you have left out a large part of it in your description. This is not a throw that automatically ends in a stable pinning position. Switching from a wrap style throw to a stable pinning position is a technical manoeuvre, and if you are going to teach this throw to beginners who want to finish in a position where they can continue with ground work, you need to teach the finishing  component which you have glossed over in this video."

For example, hip pressure and shoulder/crossface pressure on top, and how to escape from bottom from people who don't know how to stay heavy on top.  Attacking turtles is also probably fairly good-- anything but sankaku though, it's way too overused. Maybe chicken wings?"
judo,352lhi,langoustine,1 point,Thu May 7 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"This, agreed.  My three-stripe white belt BJJ game carries me pretty well in shiai, as I win most of my matches by newaza. Guard passing goes a long way, with an emphasis on passing open, half, and closed guard, as I've hardly encountered others in judo. I like sweeps from full guard and half guard, because it's easier to lock the situation down if I screw up than if I screw up a sweep from an open guard like DLR or spider. Butterfly guard sweep is very successful for me in randori, but I made a terrible mistake setting it up in a tournament once, so I consider it a little riskier than closed or half guard.  Early in my BJJ training, I set out to learn lots and lots of defenses and escapes and let the attacks sink in as they may. Knowing how to avoid and get out of bad positions pays dividends. Also, learn to attack from turtle instead of sitting there waiting for the ref to reset the match, getting to work and putting your opponent on the defensive also pays dividends."
judo,352lhi,fedornuthugger,1 point,Thu May 7 07:33:42 2015 UTC,"While I definitely did well in novice shiai in Judo, and had many pins and chokes, I remember shortly before reaching sankyu (which is brown in USJA), having just gotten my purple, I faced another green belt who was also about to get his brown who also had a purple in BJJ. We ended up being the only two in our bracket, and so we faced each other three times. Incredibly intense matches. Never assume your opponent doesn't also train BJJ!  (In our first round I gave up a crucifix because I realized I wasn't going to be able to choke him quick enough for Judo standards, but he immediately relentlessly tried to get a pin on me, and it caught me completely off guard. Another lesson learned that day: don't let go of a control position on the ground until the ref stops it, even if you know it's going nowhere.)"
judo,352lhi,dermanus,1 point,Thu May 7 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like I rarely see sankaku used as a choke, and more as a control position for pins in judo. Funny you say that.  That 'chicken wing' attack is kind of neat, though I think getting the arm of someone who is flattened out can be difficult against reasonably strong opponents.   The rules on shoulder locks have always confused me in Judo. I guess a standard hammerlock isn't legal?"

judo,352lhi,jujiroll,1 point,Thu May 7 08:18:29 2015 UTC,BJJ Sweeps for Judo would probably be your best bet. Half Guard (Go into some of that) and simple guard passes for Judo is a good start
judo,352lhi,miraoister,1 point,Thu May 7 08:52:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think quick, simple attacks against a turtling opponent should be pretty high on your list. There's a decent amount of competitive Judoka whose newaza skillsets amounts to ""turtle up and avoid newaza"". Preparing your club members to take advantage of that tendency should be a good idea.  So, think about collar chokes and quick, scooping armbars, I guess? If they're not already practicing turnovers-into-osaekomi, they should be."
judo,352lhi,Anthony126517,1 point,Fri May 8 15:14:00 2015 UTC,"Chokes. Lots of variations, lot of things to show, and people love them. Besides, they are easier to hit on beginner level than armlocks."
judo,352lhi,jujiroll,1 point,Sun May 10 05:17:08 2015 UTC,"I'd highly suggest the americana.  It's simple enough that judo dudes can own it pretty easily and then it gives them something reliable they can do besides pin.  and never too many sweeps, right?"
judo,352lhi,miraoister,1 point,Wed May 13 02:28:07 2015 UTC,"Even if the contest rules are very limited regarding newaza, this is no reason not to learn how to fight on the ground properly. in my experience most judoka don't know what to do when they are in someone's guard or how to use it properly. But the guard is a (maybe the) main concept in general groundfighting.  regarding competitions:   attacks against turtle/prone transitions from tachi-waza to ne-waza"
judo,352lhi,Anthony126517,1 point,Wed May 6 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"I tend to be very anti-guard; while I agree that it is a primary concept in ground grappling, I cringe at the idea that it's the most central concept.   I have noticed that breaking a closed guard is something Judoka typically don't know, I've gone over that. Transitions definitely."

judo,350x0j,lostMartinet,5,Wed May 6 05:20:13 2015 UTC,"It has a very old source in Antique China (Zhou Dynasty ca 1050 - 221 BCE:   萬 (wan) means 10.000 but lit. ""countless"" and ""innumerable"".  Chinese thinking came via Confucianism to Japan 1500 years ago and so learning and learning and learning and practice and practice and practice is deeply rooted in all cultures which are based on or rooted in Confucianism. Maybe the Koreans are the best Confucianists.  As Kano built Judo not only as a fighting system but as a pedagogical system (with moral and social goals too), a lot of his ideas were rooted in Neo Confucianism. But as Kano also says (and Confucius too) only repeating and repeating a countless time will not  get you to some mastery if you dont do this with your whole heart and an open mind. Kano often says, that Judo is a way (do) of flexibility (ju), were you have to adopt, create, be open, develop etc.  There are some old stories with/from  Kimura, a Judo Master from 1935 on (died 1993), who had a crazy approach on training  and did this principle ""a 10.000 times"" = ""countless repetitions"" to an excess. There is even a japanese name for this, which I don't remember.  There is also an old ""Budo Concept"" as a way/path to Mastery and its called Shu Ha Ri:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari  As a beginner, to learn and repeat and repeat and learn again is very important to learn the basics and foundamentals and refine - but always with full heart and an open mind.  Post Scriptum:  We had a little discussion on this ""10.000"" hours of practice, repetition some time ago  http://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/31zv3p/how_many_hours_of_judo_training_do_you_have/  ."
judo,350x0j,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed May 6 08:56:49 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I've not heard this before, but it makes a lot of sense. I had an old weight lifting coach that would tell us 2000 reps created really solid muscle memory. I would say that's pretty accurate in judo, especially for things like ukemi."
judo,350x0j,silvaphysh13,2,Wed May 6 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"Well the 10.000 repetitions are not meant literally, but the number is quite popular in martial arts.   I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.   - Bruce Lee  The idea behind this is, that you have to automatize complex movements and inscribe them into your socalled ""muscle memory"". You have to be able to use Judo techniques (or martial arts techniques in general) without thinking about them, otherwise shortlived opportunities to attack or defend will be gone before you can react."
judo,350x0j,I_like_turtles_dood,2,Wed May 6 12:47:31 2015 UTC,"I would say it isn't 10,000 repetitions exactly.  Instead, I would pitch that if you intelligently practice something for 20 hours, you'll have 80% of what you need in order to self-correct.  The 10,000 hour/repetition rule is a misunderstanding of the research since it was done on ""Experts.""  I n our case as normal human beings who will likely never become Olympic athletes, 20 hours of practice will give you all the basics you need to successfully trial and error a technique, thus 'learning' it to a sufficient level.

I've heard some bad stories, but then again, if I learn to fall safely..."
judo,350x0j,Kosoto_Gake,4,Wed May 6 08:23:11 2015 UTC,It won't be frowned upon but it'll be next to useless. The learning curve for judo is so much steeper than bjj and it wasn't till I upped my training to four times a week that I really started to improve.

I would say doing Judo once a week is fine. Yes you'll obviously learn more quickly if you did it more often but once a week is better than not at all. Providing you train hard in your once Judo class and think about the techniques when you are not at Judo (maybe try them in BJJ if you get to do some stand up) then you'll probably make you way slowly through the belts (about 2 a year) until you get to the darker coloured belts (green, blue brown) which may take a bit longer.  With regards to how hard it is on the body It depends on your age and how hard you train. If you do randori like your life depends on it you will get injured. You've just go to remember to take the falls and don't try too hard to resist being thrown."

judo,350x0j,silvaphysh13,2,Wed May 6 08:00:17 2015 UTC,"As a newbie you should be introduced to breakfalls (ukemi), which is a very important matter to learn at the beginning (and throughout your life as judoist).  Another thing to look out for, is how the instructors throw. Does the technique look slick and effortless? That's a good sign. If it looks clumsily and the instructor groans and mutters things like: ""This guy is too heavy"", that's a bad sign."
judo,350x0j,an_avid_brat,2,Wed May 6 12:32:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As a newbie, I would also perhaps look for schools that are a bit less competitively-focused, and more on the technical side.

judo,350x0j,silvaphysh13,2,Wed May 6 09:46:22 2015 UTC,"For many clubs, this is just a matter of practicality. Most members of most Judo clubs tend to be children, who tend to be far more interested in having fun with friends during their 6 weeks of freedom (or however long it is in your country) than going to Judo. Plus when they have all this free time, there will be more demands for their parents money from other activities.   Attendance for adults often drops in the summer months too, the allure of a BBQ or Beer Garden pulling people away from the dojo. Then of course, University based clubs do not run when it is not term time.  This nose dive in numbers makes running the class without operating at a loss difficult, so most cut their losses and shut up for the summer."

There's a place called powersourcema that I found that does judo and bjj but I can't find a ton of info about it online.  Secondly, how hard is this on the knee?  I tore my right act twice (7 years ago, and then 5 years ago didn't get it repaired the second one) but I've played other sports extensively with no problem.  Are knee braces allowed to be worn?"
judo,350x0j,emington,1 point,Wed May 6 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"Tohkan is an awesome club, I'm in Minneapolis and Tono Sensei visits often and is an excellent instructor. Looking at Power Source, they generally seemed a little less judo-focused. I would really recommend trying to at least visit Tohkan and see if you like their classes. If your first judo class does not consist of at least 20-30 minutes of falling practice, it's not a place you should attend. In regards to your knee, a brace that does not have hard metal should be totally fine. I've played with lots of people that have torn ACTs, and it's not been a huge issue."
judo,350x0j,dzendian,1 point,Wed May 6 14:55:48 2015 UTC,There is also Menomonee Judo Club. It's like 20 minutes south of Tohkan. Saves you an extra forty minutes. Probably worth it if you are north of Powersource.

judo,34yuuw,Judostu,1 point,Fri May 8 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"I did my second dan theory in April just past, I know 1st kyus are required to do part of the kata now, but not the full set as far as I'm aware.  The kata is on the grading sheet for the dan grade theory (the one with the Gokyo etc on) but if you do it competitively then you don't require as many points as a technical grading so kata is not a requirement.  The 7th dan who took my course is the leading coach in our area and oversees a massive part of the country's judo, he knows his stuff.  EDIT: If you were made to do kata, it might have been that other people on your day needed it perhaps? For my first dan, I barely needed any points whatsoever but as there were 3rd dans etc doing their theory there (not kata) we went through the whole sheet rather than what us first kyus (at the time) needed."
judo,34yuuw,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Fri May 8 13:51:38 2015 UTC,I got my competitive 1st dan via lineup and when I went on my theory course everyone there had to do kata.

judo,34yuuw,Judostu,1 point,Sun May 10 08:59:05 2015 UTC,"Like I said, you only need a certain amount of points from the grading sheet, as I understand it.

judo,34yuuw,judokalinker,2,Sat May 9 00:54:55 2015 UTC,"In Sweden it's like this for Shodan:  You chose either the competitive or the trainer/referee exam.  Then you do newaza randori (not shiai, the judges strongly emphasise this) if you don't know the difference, please learn it. You change partners 2-3 times.  Then it's time for randori tachi-waza, once again, with emphasis on randori, not shiai.  Those with competition points demonstrate the three first series of Nage no kata.  Trainers/referees show the full kata.  Next is the ""free"" program where Tori demonstrates a number of techniques of his own chosing.  Judges will next ask of you to demonstrate a few techniques of their choosing.  The judges will also ask specific questions regarding any mistakes you did in the kata, or e.g. ask when does kuzushi happen with a specific throw in the kata, to see if you have a grasp of the principles.  The judges may also ask you to demonstrate some newaza skills, like turning over uke, or you escaping and so on.  The trainers/referees may be asked to explain how they would go about teaching special aspects of judo, like ukemi or a specific throw.  For Nidan it is all the above but this time all have to demonstrate both the full Nage no kata and Katame no kata and this time with a lot more skill."
judo,34yuuw,Hippocampus88,2,Wed May 6 06:40:03 2015 UTC,"I wish it was like this in germany too. Full nage-no-kata + vast knowledge of tachi-waza and ne-waza techniques for us.

judo,34yuuw,obega,1 point,Wed May 6 06:27:25 2015 UTC,"In germany it's similar to the shodan test we have.   For Nidan it is: 7 predefined throws, (~20)samples of ne-waza techniques, some work in tachi-waza/ne-waza (nothing too special, just too much to list up), some further theoretical knowledge and last but not least a demonstration of Katame-no-kata (which takes the most practice time for most people)."
judo,34yuuw,beambeam1,1 point,Tue May 5 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"Randori, both ne waza and tachi waza (to show combinations, feints, escapes, counters and a variety of techniques, well, just randori) Nage no kata Katame no kata Q&A of sorts. Examinators ask you to show whatever they want to see, or whatever they want to hear about theoretically. This section can be short if great variety was shown during randori.    Being an instructor, referee or having won matches on regional level will give you extra ""points"" toward the final score.  Bad kata will disqualify you regardless of how good everything else is. Any section can disqualify you if it's bad enough, but that's rarely the problem if you're trying for nidan.   Edit: Bad boolean operator. Bad."

judo,34yuuw,judokalinker,1 point,Tue May 5 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"To preface, for my shodan I had to do: * The full randori-no-kata (nage/katame) as tori and uke  * Demonstrate knowledge of the full gokyo-no-waza  * Show a variety of improvised kaeshi/renraku-waza  * Show a wide range of ne-waza technique from different positions  * Answer lots of questions about pedagogy and principle    The philosophy of my sensei is that dan-grade tests should be much more about your personal approach to judo, and I was hoping to get some inspiration from things others had done. I appreciate everyone sharing!  Some ideas I've been toying with for nidan:  * Goshin-jutsu-no-kata  * Go-no-kata  * A demo lesson using a non-martial-artsy friend as a teaching subject (I'm really into instruction)  * Translating my several of my tokui-waza into a kata-like format, to examine the kuzushi and timing    Overkill?

judo,34x7ld,bozo78,2,Tue May 5 22:14:13 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely merit to using a throwing dummy if you can't get enough mat time. The issue is knowing what to do and how. Matt Dquino (sp) has a nice training dummy ebook that's worth looking at. Briefly though - you would use the dummy for nagekomi & fitness eg: 5 throws in 10 seconds, then shoulder the dummy and squat, then 10 te-gurumas etc. So, if you know what you are doing, you can get good at the mechanics of throwing (kake). Of course, you'll need to supplement that with a live partner as throwing a static dummy can only teach you so much.  I have a fairtex throwing dummy and enjoyed using it when I couldn't hit the mats. PROTIP: video yourself using it and then analyse what your doing. Why is the dummy landing off on an angle when you do ippon? How come it lands in makes that sound when you throw it with ogoshi? Etc"

Makes injury of surrounding tissue more likely, as well. Avoid it carefully.  Most likely (and usually) the pain will go away if you give it time. But there's a chance it's on a spot where it just happens to always apply pressure to a nerve and will never stop irritating you--it could essentially be the same as having a little pebble you always lay on on that side. Lame, but if that's the case, you'll eventually subconsciously adjust and find yourself just no longer laying on that side.   Cross your fingers."

Watch Katanishi: https://youtu.be/bievkFxqP4o?t=7m25s (watch from 7m25s until end)  I think your hands are used to fix uke to your back. The ""lifting"" (should be more like ""tilting"") happens because of the use of your legs and hips. Also there is no general rule to where your tsurite hand has to be. Do it, so it feels comfortable for you. Your description sounds like you doing a ude-garami on your self, so...my suggestion is to bring your elbow a little bit more towards your ribcage until it feels comfortable for you.

judo,34tlhc,ChristianDefence88,2,Wed May 6 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"Hey there, yes the Korean ""한팔 업어치기"" is the equivalent to ""Ippon Seoi Nage"" in Japanese.  One thing you may be doing is that you may be placing and lifting your ""upper-cutting"" arm too far behind your body back, instead of bringing your elbow in front of your body. Both arms need to work to pull the opponent forward. Hopefully this makes sense.  An alternative is instead of using your ""upper-cutting"" arm to lock the opponent arm, you can try grabbing hold of the opponent's gi (top part of the arm) then punching that arm up and forward as you go for the throw. See how you go with that."

I will definitely try to bring my arm more forwards. My teacher did show me the two armed version that you described today but I only got to try it once. It's also painful, haha, but this time actually because of crushing my elbow. I think I'll work on ippon seoinage for the time being so that I can learn how the other parts of the technique work, but it's good to know that there's that option."

When you are faced up against someone who is laying out a barrage of poor attacks, all you can do is defend and wait for the moment to counter. If he is stiff arming, that is his own wrongdoing, not yours, he is basically blocking himself and you from attacking properly. You could advice him mid-randori to loosen up, if it bothered you. His comment is unnecessary. He probably got upset that his failed attacks didn't work."

The young buck is paired with two partners. The partners switch taking falls and throwing. That allows a small recovery time, but ensures your young buck gets the workout he (or she–I realize buck is a boy, but you know what I mean) needs. You can always balance a practice in this way, and you can increase the group size until the frequency of throws matches your ability to take them."

It's not good for anyone, you or your partner, if you push yourself too hard and get hurt. It's important, I think, to understand when a drill is too much, and politely ask to take a short break. If your sensei absolutely refuses to accommodate, it might be time to start looking for a new dojo."
judo,34i173,fleischlaberl,2,Fri May 1 13:14:08 2015 UTC,"I am between 250 and 280 lbs too. As I train in the Dojo of the national squad the speed and power of training partners is high. It is an advantage, that the technique is also at a very high and international level BUT 265 lbs are 265 lbs. I refuse to do a lot of nage komi because its really high impact to fall with full speed on the tatami - even when there is a springfloor and ukemi is good. Most instructors were at their full moon between 130 lbs and 200 lbs so they dont understand that Judo with 170lbs is very different to Judo with 265lbs. One time I trained a national Judoka, who wanted to go from 84kg to 90kg because he couldn't make his weight ( - 81 kg) anymore. We did a lot of basic exercises like deadlift and squats and he had to eat a lot of calories mostly protein and fat. He went in 18 months at an age of 25 and 6 feet 3 inches from 84 kg to 100kg. I asked him, whats the difference in randori and shiai and he said: Its a totally different sport to do Judo and competing with 100kg. 265lbs (120kg) is in an own category and most of the real heavyweights are +115kg.  ."

I have recently dropped down from the +100 kg category, after finding that my ""meager"" 105-110 kg frame was no match for the bigger guys in this category.  Even in making this very slight change in category however, I have found some big differences in the style of judo that I need to play.  (Edit: For what it is worth, I too am a 38 year old judoka who regularly finds themselves up against National and Continental champions in randori and shiai - It's very tough sometimes to put in a competitive showing when you are trying to make up for skill, weight and age.)"

judo,34i173,H2Outbreak,4,Sat May 2 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"My instructor is old school Japanese with competition background and he takes into account age, rank, existing injuries/weaknesses, and the goals of the individual. Crash mats are used liberally.   He treats middle-aged, lower kyu grades like we are made out of glass. Middle-aged beginners are allowed to do mostly ne waza and very little standing randori. It used to frustrate me until I got to start stand up with the younger, more advanced players in the advanced class. I'm forty and come home feeling pretty battered and can't wait to pop Advil and stretch.  Juniors are allowed to spar at every session but he makes sure that there is at least one instructor to every pair doing stand up. Peewee's who aren't that great at falling get their skirts held by the instructor. Peewees might have poor judgement and technique but they're made of rubber.   Younger but experienced black belts have much more freedom.   The older players at my club are plagued with injuries and physical limitations. My instructor reminds us that we're not 25 anymore. We are told to go light, take it easy, and slowly build up our bodies so we can train harder in the future.  Encouraging, but I'm faiy certain that he knows that older guys training like a 20-something is a pipe dream."

Generally people treat me gently because I'm a beginner, but if necessary I'll simply tell my partner to take it easy on me and they always have.  If I need to sit out and rest during the 3-minute randori sessions I simply do so, I feel no need to explain or apologize for my behavior.  A couple of months ago during randori I took a bad fall and hurt my shoulder pretty bad, I've just healed up enough that I can get back to training again.  This reinforced to me that I need to be careful and just be assertive in being sure to not go beyond my physical limits."

It's the continuous breakfalling that I had to do over an hour and a half which broke me here. I'm literally talking I throw he throws and repeat with little to no break or rest so we i must have been thrown 100 times. The guy I was paired with is a nice guy and he was even throwing me left handed as I have an injury to my left elbow and didn't want to breakfall on that side. I am literally the only person this guy can be paired with at this club.

This technique is clearly a hip throw. There is a popular misconception that koshi-guruma is all about having the hand around the neck of uke and throwing over. The principle of koshi-guruma is actually 'wheeling around the hip', which implies that the hip is usually inserted deeply and uke is wheeled around it, the hip being the fulcrum.

judo,34h410,SVPPB,1 point,Fri May 1 12:57:15 2015 UTC,"It's not. Uke is wheeled upwards around tori's hip.  In Harai Goshi, uke is barely loaded on tori's hip, as in ukigoshi, and then the reaping makes her fall."

judo,34h410,SVPPB,2,Fri May 1 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"Tai otoshi is a hand throw. The main action is executed by the arms and torso, with the thrower's lower leg used merely to trip the opponent.  Harai goshi is a sweeping hip throw. You slightly unbalance your opponent, and then you sweep his legs from underneath him.  This one is obviously a hip throw, but there doesn't seem to be much sweeping. Maybe it could be considered a variation of Ogoshi?"
judo,34h410,Hesperus,1 point,Fri May 1 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"What confused was her leg going across and what looked like a tai otoshi movement, which doesn't happen with O goshi right?"
judo,34h410,fintip,1 point,Fri May 1 02:59:14 2015 UTC,"You have a memorable username. I've seen your username in /r/bjj.  I digress. O Goshi means 'big hip'. The orthodox, vanilla O Goshi doesn't have that foot out, but you could put it out if you wanted to, and it would still be O Goshi, because the defining characteristic(s) (a major hip throw) is/are still there.  Tai Otoshi's defining characteristic is not the foot, either. It means ""body drop"", and its defining mechanical principles are (and there are probably more) A) being a hand throw and B) lowering your body in relation to theirs. I might also add C) horizontal rotation, but I am not qualified to say.  I believe the Koshi Guruma variation call above is correct, for reasons he listed. As for Koshi Guruma vs O Goshi, Koshi Guruma is generally more fluid (no 'bump' or 'pop' of uke, just getting in front of them and pulling deep in one motion) and has deeper hip placement than O Goshi, which usually throws eke more diagonally."
judo,34h410,Ryvai,0,Fri May 1 07:01:12 2015 UTC,Why must you digress   So I asked above but maybe you will see this too... Her left leg coming across like that doesn't change anything?
judo,34h410,Hesperus,1 point,Fri May 1 07:24:37 2015 UTC,"That leg bump is a common way to compensate for not getting your hip low enough. As a tall guy, I use it often.  If you look at the gif, her center of gravity is actually higher than her opponent's. She can't go any lower, because she is clinching pretty close. So, she extends her back leg and does that little bump. Other than that It's still a hip throw, the basic mechanics are the same.  We actually had a thread a few days ago about this. Many people use an extreme version of this hip bump with seoi nage. Canonically, it's still seoi nage. However, it's different enough that some prominent judoka prefer to call it by the unofficial and technically incorrect name of seoi otoshi."

judo,34fhcg,Anthony126517,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:32:30 2015 UTC,We certainly see a lot of those kind of threads. Do you have any suggestions on which questions this type of FAQ might answer? :)
judo,34fhcg,Ryvai,2,Fri May 1 04:33:58 2015 UTC,"A few things I was wondering when I started. I haven't been practicing long enough to give thorough answers, myself. * Will I need to learn katas? * Why do I need to learn all these Japanese terms? * Which submissions are allowed/banned in judo? * Which takedowns are allowed/banned in judo? * What are the competition rules? * Why the upright stance? * Tips for not offending judoka."
judo,34fhcg,02-6611-0142-1,1 point,Sat May 2 04:09:38 2015 UTC,"1) you'll probably have to learn some kata for your shodan, but it's not a bad thing to learn and it depends on your organization.  2) learning the Japanese is learning the standardized terminology. It's not hard once you learn the few words that are used repeatedly. It's like if you had a BJJ student who constantly called a baseball bat choke the flying hockey stick... it just gets confusing so the Japanese names are the international standard. If you know them you can do judo anywhere.  3) Most chokes and arm locks are fine. No leg locks, and chokes that contort the spine (guillotine) are iffy.  4) Simple answer for competing is upper body throws are fine, leg grabs are banned, no flying scissors, no pulling guard.  5) That would take pages to explain. Overview is you can win by perfect throw, accumulated points from takedown and/or pin, and submission.  6) Keeping your hips under you and good posture keeps you in a stable but highly mobile position. Since leg grabs are out there is no reason to lean over in a poor imitation of a wrestling stance, in fact it will earn you a penalty (and it's breaking your balance forward which makes you less stable and less mobile and more throwable).  7) Mostly just don't be a dick, follow the dojo protocol, and don't assume you know more than them. Be open to what judo has to offer in and of itself as well as add to your overall grappling game."
judo,34fhcg,pk618,2,Sat May 2 13:36:06 2015 UTC,"1 May vary a bit. The Finnish federation, for example, requires the te waza portion of Nage no kata for 2. kyu, te- koshi- and ashi wazas for 1.kyu and the whole thing for 1 dan."
judo,34fhcg,Hrtzy,1 point,Sun May 3 16:59:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand the guillotine rule before, it's a spinal thing? Most modern guillotine variations are either a blood choke or a trachea crush, and you'd only get spinal torque if you messed it up.  I'm also confused by the ude garame/kimura being allowed while shoulders locks are banned. I understand that you could adjust your grip to attack the elbow instead, but the version that I see taught at the two judo clubs that I've visited is still the shoulder-attacking version I learned from BJJ.  So are submissions just banned on a submission-by-submission basis, rather than a joint-by-joint basis? And here's a related question: If I hit an omoplata or something while rolling (in training, not in competition) does that upset people? Or do judo clubs tend to play around with stuff that isn't comp-legal when they're outside competitions?  It's not that I'm trying to be an asshole and ""win"" while practicing, but more that I'm trying to build a cohesive game that I can apply across both arts without annoying people."
judo,34fhcg,02-6611-0142-1,1 point,Mon May 4 04:01:07 2015 UTC,"It probably varies per club. As far as ude garami, I've never seen anyone complain about too much of a shoulder attack. My club cross trains in Judo, sambo, no gi and BJJ a lot so you see a lot of subs that would probably be against the rules when we roll. If it's a new person and they hit a sub that would technically be against the rules I tap then explain why it would be against the rules just so they become aware of the competition rules. If it's a more seasoned player I just go with it. I usually advise BJJ players to work their escapes, pins, and turtle attacks instead of playing a lot of guard so they are developing those areas That are more emphasized in Judo vs BJJ in case they compete.   In most cases, you can always ask the Sensei what the club's preference is with iffy submissions."
judo,34fhcg,pk618,1 point,Mon May 4 07:02:13 2015 UTC,Common questions across most threads.  1.Can I use my BJJ Gi in a Judo class.  A.Yes mostly but ask your instructor first.  2.Is judo dangerous.  (You see this one a lot on /r/bjj when people are asking about starting judo.) A.Not if you learn to break-fall properly and throw safely(i.e. not onto uke's head).  Beyond that I don't really know I was hoping some cross trainers could chime in with some of the concerns they hear from other BJJ practitioners.

judo,34d9fx,vipchicken,18,Thu Apr 30 05:31:47 2015 UTC,"I think, somewhere along the line, you have erroneously associated strength and ""slamming"" with judo. It's not like that.  The techniques in judo are able to be performed by anyone regardless of strength. Technique is highly sought after. It is called ""the easy way"" because it does not rely on strength to perform the technique.  Quick answers:   Teachers of BJJ claim that a man with little strength can do extremely well against a man with lots of strength if the little man has better BJJ technique. Would you agree with this statement?   Yes, absolutely.   Respected people in BJJ have criticized Judo by claiming that it focuses less on form and more on strength. I would agree with this, seeing as how Judo seems to emphasize slams and slams seem to need power to perform, but then again I don't know jack shit. Would you agree with this critique of Judo?   Nope, not at all.   If I roll with someone in BJJ who is heavier, I can often get them to tap even though they're heavier than me (as long as the weight difference isn't more than about 40 pounds) if I have better BJJ form. But I believe it'd be harder for me if slams were mixed in. Would I be able to do win against a 40 pound heavier opponent in Judo (if I have better Judo form)?   Yes, absolutely.   Do slams need power or can a skinny guy take down a heavy guy with a particular slam?   If your technique is up to scratch you will have no difficulty throwing or submitting a larger opponent.    This is kind of a stupid question, but why is Judo called the ""gentle way"" when slamming is incredibly violent and you could be injured severely?   No such thing as a stupid question! We are all learning. It's called the gentle way because it emphases good technique, balance, timing, etc. You are trained to break fall and we don't slam anyone.    Is it true that BJJ is much less violent (due to less slams) and you would be less prone to injury if you do BJJ? I have a lot of respect for Judo, as BJJ comes from Judo. However, I also want to be safe and avoid spine/nerve damage and/or back paralysis (from slams). Should I just suck it up and join a Judo school or are my concerns perfectly valid and worth fretting over?   Sounds to me like someone has passed on a particularly jaded view of judo throws, by referring to them as violent slams and what have you. I highly recommend you join a club and have a look.  When practicing a technique, the tori (the person performing the technique) will usually hold your gi to allow you to break fall easily (ukemi). The uke (the person having the technique done on them) will have a working knowledge of break falling. This reduces the risk of injury.   EDIT: Some phrases by Kano Jigoro for your consideration:   Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort  Mutual Welfare and Benefit   These are concepts, or ideologies, that are associated with judo."
judo,34d9fx,Carlos13th,3,Thu Apr 30 05:57:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, your post cleared up a myriad of misconceptions for me.

judo,34d9fx,H2Outbreak,2,Thu Apr 30 08:49:06 2015 UTC,Even wrestling throws and take downs that look like they might be reliant on power are reliant on technique first and foremost. The power just helps.

judo,34d9fx,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:53:12 2015 UTC,As a new guy to judo they can be scary because you are not used to them but each time you get thrown they get a little less scary. They don't break you and injure you with every throw though. The guys in training are not trying to put you through the mat they are just trying to unbalance you and throw you. They will often tug on your gi when throwing you to let you land softer. (You wont get the same courtesy at comp though)Also you will be taught how to deal land safely from throws in training.

judo,34d9fx,jujiroll,6,Thu Apr 30 14:20:36 2015 UTC,"Teachers of BJJ claim that a man with little strength can do extremely well against a man with lots of strength if the little man has better BJJ technique. Would you agree with this statement?   Yes. And you may substitute ""BJJ"" with ""Judo"" throughout the text and the same holds true.   Respected people in BJJ have criticized Judo by claiming that it focuses less on form and more on strength. I would agree with this, seeing as how Judo seems to emphasize slams and slams seem to need power to perform, but then again I don't know jack shit. Would you agree with this critique of Judo?   In one word? Bullshit.  A more elaborate answer would be this: Some judo clubs don't do high quality judo and thus their practitioners rely on too much strength and too little technique. Those exceptions aside, throws or ""slams"" as you call them rely far less on strength than you think. Every throwing technque of judo, if perfectly timed and executed works against much heavier opponents.   If I roll with someone in BJJ who is heavier, I can often get them to tap even though they're heavier than me (as long as the weight difference isn't more than about 40 pounds) if I have better BJJ form. But I believe it'd be harder for me if slams were mixed in. Would I be able to do win against a 40 pound heavier opponent in Judo (if I have better Judo form)?   The better you are at Judo, the less the weight of your opponent will be relevant. See: BJJ stems from Judo. Maximum efficiency, making the best use of your physical and mental powers, was not invented by the Gracies, it is one of the core principles of Judo. BJJ does a great job at using this priciple of couse, but it's not exclusive to BJJ.   Do slams need power or can a skinny guy take down a heavy guy with a particular slam?   Yes, if you do it right. The idea of most throws is not to pick the opponent up like a weightlifter or anything like that, instead we try to topple our opponent via leverage, momentum and cleverly placed fulcrums. The problem is, that it takes much longer to learn to set up and apply such techniques properly than ground techniques. If timing is important on the ground, it is tenfold so in a standing fight.   Is it true that BJJ is much less violent (due to less slams) and you would be less prone to injury if you do BJJ? I have a lot of respect for Judo, as BJJ comes from Judo. However, I also want to be safe and avoid spine/nerve damage and/or back paralysis (from slams). Should I just suck it up and join a Judo school or are my concerns perfectly valid and worth fretting over?   If you practice breakfalls properly you should be fine. The greatest risk, as usual, stems from wild beginners and overzealous players, but if you avoid those the risk of injury isn't overly great."
judo,34d9fx,vipchicken,7,Thu Apr 30 07:57:08 2015 UTC,"Saying judo is strength based because of it's emphasis on slamming is like someone saying BJJ is based on strength because of pressure passing. First up there is more to BJJ than pressure passes, and secondly pressure passes are still very skill based even if they don't look that way on first appearance.   Lifting the guy up and slamming them down is not that common in judo. With most of the throws if there is any lifting component, it is just enough to lighten the amount of weight they are carrying on their feet so you can get their centre of balance away from any support and then drop them. This takes skill and strength, and the more skill you have the less strength you need. (The opposite is also true.)  A lot of the time though the throw is a straight up drop where you just clip their feet from under them by tapping them as they move - look at deashi barai for example. So if you are not that physically strong compared to your opponent you still have options.   If you train BJJ though, you should already be aware of the reality that strength is an important factor when you are grappling. There is no getting away from that whether you do Judo, BJJ or whatever."

There is no getting away from that whether you do Judo, BJJ or whatever.   I haven't done Judo so I can't speak on my performance in it, but in BJJ I don't really require strength much. I mean, I did when I started out; I would abuse my strength on lower belt guys and lose to higher belts.   When I grapple now, I just sort of ""ride the wave"" for a bit. It's hard to explain; I'm not really a ragdoll my opponent can just get into leverage positions with, but at the same time I'm basically ""playing dead"" as much as possible while making sure my opponent doesn't get a good position.   I was inspired to do this after watching Royce Gracie fight in the UFC. I noticed he'd rest a lot in the fight, while his opponent was just wasting energy away. I really admire that kind of fighting, where you don't even lose your cool and you still win eventually.   For me, BJJ is more like ""chess"", rather than a ""show of strength""."

I would agree with this, seeing as how Judo seems to emphasize slams and slams seem to need power to perform, but then again I don't know jack shit.    The first thing you learn in Judo is how to fall. You also practice falling basically every day you train when you do static repetition of throws. You shouldn't worry to much at all about getting hurt.   It's like getting hurt from getting your knee/shoulder twisted while on the ground. Chances are slim and usually it's only a few days of minor pain. But sometimes people do get seriously injured, but it's pretty much as often as it would happen in bjj.    Do slams need power or can a skinny guy take down a heavy guy with a particular slam?   Some of the guys I do judo with go to a college with a great sense. That guy is maybe 140 lb. and throws people over 200 lb. like it's nothing."

I would agree with this, seeing as how Judo seems to emphasize slams and slams seem to need power to perform, but then again I don't know jack shit. Would you agree with this critique of Judo?   Who are these respected people? I don't agree with this. Strength helps both Judo and BJJ but technique is what helps you beat the other guy more than strength. Strength may help a little more in  Judo than BJJ but you turn up to a Judo class strong but with no technique you are probably gonna end up facing the ceiling pretty soon. I got thrown yesterday by a guy who I had several stone on.    Would I be able to do win against a 40 pound heavier opponent in Judo (if I have better Judo form)?   If you are better than them yes. The larger the weight and strength difference the more of a skill gap between the two of you you need to bridge the size and strength gap. Same is true in BJJ or any art.   Do slams need power or can a skinny guy take down a heavy guy with a particular slam?   Judo does throws more than slams, slams in BJJ being lifting someone up and then slamming them down Judo throws tend to be one continuous motion not a lift then a slam. Leverage and unbalancing is what causes judo throws to work, strength makes them easier sure but its not the key point.   Is it true that BJJ is much less violent (due to less slams) and you would be less prone to injury if you do BJJ? I have a lot of respect for Judo, as BJJ comes from Judo. However, I also want to be safe and avoid spine/nerve damage and/or back paralysis (from slams). Should I just suck it up and join a Judo school or are my concerns perfectly valid and worth fretting over?   I would say there is less chance of injury in BJJ than Judo due to the high amplitude throws in Judo. But Judo also teaches you how to deal with these with break falls. Sure you get hurt sometimes but I don't think there is a significant risk of being paralised etc. Also if you go to BJJ comps you really wanna know how to breakfall from a throw. You don't wanna get thrown by someone with no idea how to breakfall.  Personally I don't think its a Judo vs BJJ thing. They are both great arts and complement each other really well. BJJ helps fill some of the gaps in Judo and Judo helps fill some of the holes in BJJ. Training both will improve both."

judo,34d9fx,t4c0b3ll,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'8"" / 140lbs and started about a few weeks ago.  The chap who showed me my first few throws is 6'2"" / 220lbs. When my technique isn't spot on (often for now haha!) he doesn't move an inch, no amount of my strength is getting someone with good balance at his weight down without the correct technique. What I'm trying to say is my strength would obviously not get him to move. Yet when I do a technique correctly he goes down so easily. It's almost unbelievable right now how easy it actually is when it's done right. It seems to be all about balance points and centres of gravity - putting your opponent off balance and using that against them. You are merely there to help the naturally occurring physics from that position. So yeah a skinny 5'8"" chap can take down a heavy set 6'2 chap with correct technique.  I think you've got the term slam wrong here. When a judo throw is done right and someone lands correctly there's a ""snap"" sound on the floor - mostly from a breakfall being performed. This is actually what makes it not hurt and not be a slam. If you didn't know how to breakfall this would hurt like a mother fucker. If you take a class and get thrown you'll know what I mean. A thud is someone landing pretty incorrectly it seems that I've done a few of these but you get the breakfalls down pretty quickly. The higher ups will usually guide you in your first times being thrown so you can get the technique down and not get hurt while learning to breakfall.  There's really not much strength used in the throws - more speed than anything else.  Give it a try, I'm loving it so far."

It doesn't hurt or feel that forceful if you breakfall. I don't even feel pain when falling 99% of the time, and when I do it's because I didn't fall properly. The worst that happens is losing your breath, and breathing out while being thrown combats that."

With HIIT, you're supposed to do the exercise (I prefer stationary bikes) at an all-out, 100%, running for your life as if you're being chased by a  tiger type of pace, then rest briefly, then do another high intensity interval, then repeat. It's not possible to go all-out for 2 minutes. If you can, then you're not working hard enough. Of course, this is all if you're talking about HIIT.

Repetition is key IMO to developing the technique to give the explosiveness"
judo,348sk3,academicninja,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:02:28 2015 UTC,I think thats a valid concern. But once you get the barebones down only repeated practice will reveal the faults. Then you can correct those with more practice and eventually get your explosiveness. I found my seio nage's improve dramatically when I started using the elastic bands (I had poor kuzushi).

judo,348sk3,t4c0b3ll,2,Sat May 2 07:44:55 2015 UTC,"/u/burritopete is probably correct. In most places I think they'll be totally okay with you using a BJJ gi, especially if it's Blue or White.   I've got a Fuji single weave somewhere, and in my experiences it shrunk a significant amount height-wise, but not so much in the body. However, I've got long legs and long arms, so that may just be my experience."

judo,348sk3,efa999,2,Thu Apr 30 15:08:54 2015 UTC,How do I make upward Kuzushi with my lapel(tsurite) hand for throws like Uchi-Mata? During Uchi-Komi we tend to just pull linear however a training partner pointed out I should be using more of a lifting motion to get uke's center of gravity disrupted and have uke's balance on their toes. Any good videos or advice on the mechanics of the tsurite hand? Thanks.
judo,348sk3,silvaphysh13,3,Wed Apr 29 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"I've found pulling down first to be very effective. Think of trying to pull uke's upper body towards your center of mass. Then, do not initiate major lifting until tsukuri is already happening. If you watch high-level judoka demonstrate throws, they often do this exact thing, albeit subconsciously."
judo,348sk3,academicninja,2,Wed Apr 29 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"Pulling up is right, but you should pull down before that. Watch this, very closely:  https://youtu.be/X3NrAXOQ1RI?t=1m48s  Do you see around 1:48, when he actually throws, the shortly and sharply pulls uke down with his hands. This is to make him rise his upper body as a reflex. The rise of uke's upper body shifts his weight towards his toes. It's a form of hando no kuzushi, destabilization by reaction. This works for similar throws as well."
judo,348sk3,Nymerod,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"You can already see that there are many dif opinions on this.   Pulling down is fine as a first step like others say, but its used as a feign to get uke to react (yes, use it)   The actual technique calls for an up and out style motion (Note: short people may actually pull down and out). I prefer to twist my lapel grip like i am trying to wrap uke's lapel around my inner wrist (so my palm faces me). This gets my elbow into the crook of his/her armpit area which helps me with my lifting pulling (because now i have some additional friction on my side)"

Obviously I knew it was gonna be much harder with an opponent actually defending but I don't know what I have to work on to be able to perform it in randori. :/"
judo,348sk3,geocattes,3,Wed Apr 29 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"Trust me, we all have this problem to some extend. Throwing a judoist who defends is very difficult. A few ways to deal with it are these:   Remain relaxed, don't aim at doing a specific throw and flow with the events. Feel out your opponent. Kumi Kata. If you are able to get a dominant grip on your opponent he will have great difficulties to resist your attacks or attacking on his own. Some frown about excessive grip fighting, but it is actually a way to make the fight go the way you want. Kumi Kata also includes learning how to get out of the grip of an opponent and thus taking away some of his ability to resist. Small opportunities are easier to find than big ones. Practice techniques like Ko Uchi Gari, De Ashi Harai, Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi and Okuri Ashi Harai. They may not be as cool as big throws, but openeings to apply them occur oftener. Combine attacks. The techniques mentioned in 3. may not hit all the time, far from it, but they often force your opponent to make akward evasive movements you may be able to exploit with other techniques. Drill combinations. A single technique can be applied in varaious ways. Practice throws with various entries like turning towars uke, turning away from uke, side way entries, circular entries and both left and right. The more options you have in your arsenal, the more likely it is that you'll find an opening you can exploit. Last but not least: More randori. Experiecene cannot be substituted by anything than more experience."
judo,348sk3,academicninja,2,Sat May 2 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"If they are truly being ""defensive"" (like arms locked out), use that to your advantage.  You can move hard with your whole body and they will go with you.  For instance, if you pivot hard with your right, back, foot in a turning/ripping motion, they'll come with you.  Leaving your left foot in place leaves you already at step 1 of osoto gari.  It's hard to enumerate all your options from this, as it's just an example.  What I like to do against a defensive person is to step in kind of deep with my right foot, and turn my body and do hiza guruma at the same time.  Also, you can experiment with stepping back really hard (which will pull them onto you since they're hanging on for dear life) which is kuzushi for a lot of throws.  Stepping into it probably isn't going to work, but you have at least 3 other directions to move/throw.  tl;dr: take advantage of their death grip and locked-out arms and their ability to react more slowly by not being supple by moving your body hard and watch them come with you"

judo,348sk3,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"you can still do o-ouchi gari from the belt sleeve grip. - you need to get really deep on your opponent - think shoulder on his ribs. Then same regular o-ouchi gari footwork bring the the sleeve grip up (grab the bottom of the sleeve not the top or this won't be possible) and towards the leg you are reaping and lean all your weight towards the leg you are reaping. It works well if you are able to feint a O-Goshi first to get that action reaction.   Alternatively you can use the o-ouchi gari from here to make the opponent take a big step backwards making the entry for your O-Goshi much easier.  As you get good at one technique it's important to think about developing your combinations and setups.   Note: The shoulder on the ribs should be used to bump the opponent off balance and along with the sleeve grip, to bring his weight on the foot you're reaping."
judo,348sk3,fedornuthugger,2,Thu Apr 30 07:54:25 2015 UTC,"About O Uchi Gari:  There are two basic forms (and endless variations of course). The first is applied against a standing uke:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muqe5SheOxc  The idea is stepping close towards uke, as if you were doing more or less standard uchi komi (just not turned as much perhaps). You pull uke towards you, while you do so. Not so much that he steps forward, but enough to trigger a slight counter reaction from him: make him shift his weight backwards. That's when you reap his leg with yours in a cricling motion from the inside to the outside. You own hips should be lowered a bit for two reasons: You'll be more stable standing on one leg when the knee is somewhat bent and you are in a better position to push into him with your mass.  The second one is applied against a moving uke:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWvibReYilU  Assuming a right sided standard grip, try to make uke circle around you to your right. Anticipate one of these wide steps past your right side and take away your opponents leg before he can fully settle it down. You hand at his sleeve guides the redirection of uke from a pull into a push. Make a circling motion with said hand as if stirring a bing pot of soup (look what Hiroshi Katanishi does in the second video).   About ""small, hyper dudes"" in newaza. If you are heavier than your opponent and thus slower, use your mass to your advantage. Grab their gi somewhere (preferably the limbs), and direct your weight downwards. In other words lean onto them, hang onto them and try to remain relaxed. Don't exhaust yourself, just try to be a really, really heavy bag of sand glued to them. Very soon their muscles will tire out and you can proceed calmly to make your move. Let your weight and gravity work for you. It's not elegant, it's probably not noble, but it's efficient."
judo,348sk3,fedornuthugger,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:11:10 2015 UTC,"Assuming you take sleeve grip with your left hand and collar grip with your right, give a small tug to your left as if you are going for Osoto-gari, then as he tries to re-stabilise to the center you should be able to get him to over-reach and place balance onto his left foot (your right). As you make your move for Ouchi-gari, use your collar grip to sort of slip the gi jacket off his shoulder, backwards and down as if undressing that shoulder, that will help send his balance back on his left foot. Now reap."

(sleeve grip goes either up towards the side you are reaping or pinned to his body strongly - while lapel grip goes down towards leg. note: you can also bring the lapel up and over the shoulder of your opponent to really drive the weight on their reaped leg.  It is also important to really ""paint the floor with the inside of your big toe"" when you reap to catch the leg at the heel and not up high back of his knee where he will resist easily. - see one of the other posts about the footwork and importance of bending the knees In newaza - you stop intensity by slowing things down. Fighting for position doesn't have to be fast- it can be strong and methodical. Superior grip fighting and positioning can negate strength and explosion. Without knowing the positions in which you get beat it's impossible to give technical advise."
judo,348sk3,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:54:52 2015 UTC,"Key with all those positions is to ebi-ebi (shrimp) to prevent your opponent from locking in the position and to work towards recovering guard or getting back to your feet. Key to kamishiho gatame is to keep your hips aligned with your opponents (do not let him get up high on you, so use ebi ebi). I would say make sure to learn 2 effective escapes from each position - during newaza practice ask one of your fellow judoka (the same guy if possible) to start in those positions and work your escapes (with them at 50% to start and each time you escape to increase the difficulty) - also have them correct technical mistakes you make while attempting to escape. It's important to take this approach for all your weaknesses and offer to do the same for your fellow judoka. Mutual benificence at work.   I can't stress enough how bridging and shrimping is important. Always shrimp when an opponent is passing your guard or about to get dominant positions - non stop shrimpring before they can lock down the position. It's important to make people work for positions- it forces your opponent to be more technical and it buys you time to recover position.   Take a page from our sister martial art BJJ - they specialize in newaza and have developed a variety of different escapes from each position.  Experiment to figure out which escapes fit your style, your body type and the style of your opponent. There is a wealth of resources on youtube that you can take advantage of.   escaping mount: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3Sdi6vT1oA  escaping side control: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l9tP2gRuOo  Escaping Kami shiho Gatame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoNiqF3E5RE  Escape Kesa Gatame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gszdlw8IzyM&index=3&list=PLJC1SXWMUy83ItuIy52xuz-wkVBxkQORv  Those are just a few.

That being said, you dragging your partner down doesn't really further this, as it keeps them from supporting you during the fall, as well as prevents them from being in a good position for control. It's also generally a dangerous practice to try to hang on to people, for both parties involved. If you do this on a really big throw, your ukemi will suck, and you'll likely get a gnarly bump. Conversely, I've seen toris get injured because they got pulled down onto someone's knee, etc.."
judo,348sk3,derioderio,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"I think that would depend on the throw. If my partner throws me with an uchi mata I am going to maintain my lapel grip so the fall isn't as hard. If tori cannot stay balanced then I'd consider it his issue. It also ensures your ukemi are in correct position.  Pulling down, of course, is different."
judo,348sk3,ckristiantyler,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:14:25 2015 UTC,IMO maintaining a grip is fine within reason. We teach people to hold on to a lapel grip on big throws so they can get used to and land properly. A moderate pull will dampen the impact of a fall.   But intentionally pulled tori down with you is dangerous and should be avoided. Also it tends to mess up your fall as you are less on your side and more on your back.

judo,347xsn,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"Respectfully Ryvai, I believe you are incorrect. Ude - Arm. Hishigi - Lock.  Arm lock is the general term, not armbar. When someone refers to an armbar, (a bar - a straight object) they are always referring to juji gatame. The technique shown in the video is juji gatame. And  no one uses the term ude hishigi, except in the most formal situation. (ex. maybe a written exam portion of a promotion) I've been to dojos around the world, and ""juji gatame"" or often just ""juji"" is always the nomenclature used for an armbar. http://judoinfo.com/jujigatame.htm"
judo,347xsn,bull_in_chinashop,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"You can say you disagree, that's fine, but it is not incorrect. 'Ude' means arm, 'hishigi' 挫 does not mean to 'lock', it means something along the lines of crushing, breaking or hyper-extension, basically it is the prefix that determines what happens with the arm.  It is correct that the classic armbar is abbreviated juji-gatame most of the time, I even say that and almost never pronounce ude-hishigi, there's nothing wrong with that, but if one does not understand what it is there for, it looses context. 'juji' means cross or perpendicular in this scenario, 'gatame' is something that is held in place or 'hold down' if you will, 'Juji-gatame' means that you hold the arm in the cross position, it does not imply anything about what happens with the arm, that is what ude-hishigi is for. Judoinfo.com is a great resource, but just because they abbreviate it juji-gatame does not change the truth. It's official name is ude-hishigi-juji-gatame, and that for the reason I explained above. Kodokan mentions their stand on the matter on their webpage in the following way;   Kodokan uses the formal name ""Ude-hishigi-juji-gatame"" or ""Ude-hishigi-ude-gatame"" instead of abbreviating the names such as ""Juji-gatame"" or ""Ude-gatame"".   It is true that when people refer to armbars they are usually refering to juji-gatame, but that is not always the case. I've seen waki-gatame, ashi-gatame, ude-gatame, etc. all referred to as 'armbar' by bjj practitioners. So, the correct way would be to say that 'ude-hishigi' is a general term for armbars (many different ways), but when referring to the specific 'armbar' shown in the video above, you are correct that it is ude-hishigi-juji-gatame :)"

judo,33zzps,Zorionto,8,Mon Apr 27 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"I used to be a competitive swimmer.  I am now a judoka.  I don't do much swimming anymore.  However, if I did, I would explicitly not focus on distance swimming, but would instead focus on interval training with the time clock on the side.  The reason why is that slow, plodding swimmers (or joggers, for that matter) make for slow, plodding judoka.  What you want is a combination of maximum and explosive power, and non-aerobic interval training will get you that, while long-distance aerobic training will actually take away from it."
judo,33zzps,ShinshinRenma,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight! I won't badger you with questions that I could easily find through google, but how long would an interval training session go on for?"
judo,33zzps,ShinshinRenma,2,Mon Apr 27 05:30:54 2015 UTC,"In swimming, probably 10-15 minutes of hard swimming intervals with brief rests in between.  No more than 20, for sure.  I would probably combine swimming interval training with a weightlifting program, as well.  I'm partial to kettlebells and barbells (particularly kettlebells are handy for home workouts), although I would also be open to gymnastics for strength training, as well (did that for a while.  I owe a lot of my strength and flexibility to that.  I'm a small guy, but pound for pound one of the strongest in my karate dojo where I fight.  I am unfortunately the smallest dude in my judo dojo)."
judo,33zzps,OnceNFutureNick,6,Mon Apr 27 05:35:09 2015 UTC,"I would point to Ronda Rousey as an example here. She started as a competitive swimmer as a child and switched to judo after her father died. In the lead up to most of her UFC fights you always see her doing two things: swimming and judo.  Plus, swimming is low impact, amazing cardio, and a full body workout. Now I need to find a pool..."
judo,33zzps,C4Aries,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:28:48 2015 UTC,"One of my senseis was just saying how swimming is a great work out for judoka, because swimming recruits so many muscles into your movements similar to judo."

judo,33zzps,H2Outbreak,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:01:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a middle-aged, recreational judoka, and not a great swimmer nor an endurance athlete by any means, but swimming is in my repertoire for maintaining my base cardio. I usually just do 4x400m once a week which is probably a light workout for most decent swimmers. Other times, I might row 5km or run 2-3 miles to mix it up.   I've participated in super sprint triathlons and short open ocean swim/runs just to push myself, but I personally wouldn't commit to endurance racing cuz I just don't enjoy it. I don't think distance swimming would ""hurt"" your judo unless you ignore other facets of your conditioning (phosphogenic/glycolytic pathways).  Ultimately, we all have a finite amount of time. Only you can decide what's best for you.  UFC fighter Nick Diaz competes in triathlons for fun. He'll probably never make the Olympic team, but he probably doesn't give a shit."

judo,33zzps,neohampa,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:28:44 2015 UTC,"I also like to swim for ""active recovery"" the day after hard randori or when my body just feels wrecked. I just leave my watch off and go for easy laps to get blood flowing. Much easier on the knees than running.   Another benefit is breathing control. Swimming forces you to be very efficient with your breathing and pacing. This helps immensely during ne waza. Panic breathing and spazzing for your life becomes a thing of the past."
judo,33zzps,OnceNFutureNick,-3,Mon Apr 27 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"It won't improve your judo any more than picking up choir singing.  If you want to improve your judo you need to train, study and compete more in judo.  If you enjoy swimming go do it for its own sake."

judo,33zzps,neohampa,-4,Mon Apr 27 12:30:20 2015 UTC,"Improving the body is a just a side effect of mastering the techniques.  Instead of thinking ""I need to improve a mussle group/cardio/flexibility"" think ""I want to master Uchi Mata"". Focus on uchi mata, what makes it tick, seek out teachers to study it from, do 1500 to 8000 correct repetitions, try from different angles, learn it left and right. What is the correct hand positions against shorter players, longer players. Find the correct timing for it.  Then you will improve your judo and get all the benefits that come with it, such as a healthy strong body.  Mindlessly wasting hours running, lifting weights or swimming will ultimately slow down your judo progress."
judo,33zzps,onehungrybear,6,Mon Apr 27 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but that is complete nonsense. All world class Judo players, and all world class athletes of any sport, will incorporate some level of cross training to improve their level.  No running? No lifting weights?! That's idiotic.   All the rest is good, you'll improve Uchi Mata doing 10,000 repetitions than by just increasing your deadlift. Now do both."

I have seen BJJ blackbelt takedown Judo blackbelt in BB Division. Judo guys tend to be good at standing however that doesn't mean BJJ BB are bad at it (some rather pull guard but not everybody is bad), Also what about Wrestlers or Sambo guys I would be surprised if they got a throw/takedown on a judoka and won, have seen this before."

I will look at both of you in this case.  You: If your gonna have a low stance shoot in don't just go around & around. Second break his grip right away so he doesn't have control to throw,sweep you or pull guard. Third don't let him put his foot in because he could have swept you off him. You got the armbar & the win so that's always good.  Now the other guy: Don't go around and try to pull guard like that. If your gonna do it jump guard is probably better since he doesn't have any stand up. Second could of gone for a sweep when he had his leg between (learn sweeps). 3rd - When you have Half guard don't be flat on your back, be on your side. 4th - Don't turn your back away because the got a free armbar because he let you have the position, stay relaxed you could put the other had on the knee and push off by grabbing from the inside.  Overall both are new whitebelt probably 1-3 months BJJ. I say congrats on competing you always learn sometimes win or lose. Always stay humble & check your ego at the door. Keep learning and getting better :)"
judo,33xzka,Anthony126517,4,Mon Apr 27 04:28:42 2015 UTC,"As a BJJ purple, you guys had a surprisingly competent match for your level, and that was a good catch on the armbar! I was expecting you to catch one on him for making a similar mistake at about 1:33, though. Looks like he had a lesson to learn and you were the guy to teach him.  There's always something to learn, but this video is nothing to be ashamed of.   Lastly, though, I think I wouldn't really post this in /r/judo.

Otoshi can be done with or without knees touching the ground. Nage can be done before or after the knees have touched the ground. It's about whether or not uke is loaded onto the back or just thrown down.

judo,33t8hp,fozzit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think this one is not so much a ""myth"", rather than a deliberate decision.  Guys like Koga and Ohlenkamp are pretty well informed on judo waza nomenclature, yet they still insist on calling that hybrid throw ""seoi otoshi"".   My instructor, who used it often in competition back in the 70s and 80s, also calls it by that name. In fact, he doesn't teach and strongly discourages using ""drop seoinage"", because it's harmful to tori's knees.  As a tall guy with long legs, I hardly ever throw anyone with seoi nage. However, I've found that the shoulder/hip throw variation we wrongly call seoi otoshi is a very viable option for me.  In my humble opinion, that throw deserves it's own name, whatever it is. It's distinct enough from seoi nage to be considered more than a mere application. In fact, unlike seoi nage, it can be executed with a standard sleeve and lapel grip, which in my view puts it closer to tai otoshi than to seoi nage"
judo,33t8hp,SVPPB,4,Sat Apr 25 12:18:43 2015 UTC,"That's another thing I would call a myth: drop seoinage (there is this other name suwari-seoinage?) is bad for knees.  Is there any evidence for this? Or is it just another anethodocial judo-standard with no real proof? I know of one study CK posted on the judoforum: http://judo.forumsmotion.com/t1930-suwari-seoi-drop-seoi-nage-and-its-dangers  Than it's always a matter how you do it. In the video with sophie cox it's really a hard drop, because she turns standing and than just drop.  But if you drop to you knees but you are more ""sliding in"" like go tsunoda does: https://youtu.be/k7NfHgbhDeA (except he doesn't drop but you can see the turning in is already a height level lower than standing) the drop is not that hard I feel an impact on my shins rather than my knees.  So i'm not really convinced of the ""drop seoi nage is bad for knees""-thing."

judo,33t8hp,fleischlaberl,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:45:10 2015 UTC,"Well, if you do it quickly, it is a bit of a hard landing.  In class, there was one very talented and extremely fit blue belt that would throw drop seoi nage almost exclusively. He quit doing it after a while, because his knees were getting banged up pretty hard. Now he does a more conventional standing seoi nage and then he slowly rolls on his knees as in a soto makikomi."
judo,33t8hp,SVPPB,0,Sun Apr 26 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Good post trumf. Suwari-seoi is a nickname for those seoi-nage we label 'drop seoi-nage'. 'Suwari' means; kneeling or seated. I prefer that reference instead of the dreaded 'drop' naming, which does not belong together with the normal terminology, it also creates the misconception we are seeing so much right now. The reason we drop down low for seoi-nage is to get underneath uke's centre of gravity and raise upwards. It requires very little energy to throw, especially if you are a bit shorter than your opponents, like me. I never drop down directly onto my knees, instead I dampen it with my shins. Here's an example from last year where I drop down, but it becomes nage as I raise up afterwards to project uke forward."
judo,33t8hp,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"Guys like Koga and Ohlenkamp are pretty well informed on judo waza nomenclature, yet they still insist on calling that hybrid throw ""seoi otoshi"".  My instructor, [...] also calls it by that name. ...   I assume they call it that way, because they learned it being called that way. And like I wrote it is a very prevalent misconception, at least if you classify techniques from the Kodokan's point of view. I don't know where the problem originates, but it has probably been around for very long."

They have a big space and nice mats. Also one of the cheaper clubs. There's Kensington Judo Club in East Van, very good club, smaller space, good people. Slightly more price wise than the UBC club. There is a club downtown in a rec center called The Gathering Place that has Judo fridays, for $10 a year. They like their newaza there so be prepared. There is Burnaby Judo Club that is from my understanding a competition club, maybe not the best for beginners. (I've never been there) There is Steveston Judo Club in Steveston which is south of Richmond BC.  Hope this helps."

Classic example: seoi nage to kouchi gari. If the seoi nage is weak or fake, against an experienced partner, tori will not illicit a strong enough response from uke such that uke is unbalanced, and therefore not vulnerable to follow on attacks.  tl;dr  combinations=good  feint=bad (for beginners)"

judo,33qx4r,aids_demonlord,9,Fri Apr 24 19:50:17 2015 UTC,http://www.beginningbjj.com/BJJ%20Roadmap%201.3.pdf  This should be everything you need!  Look up beginner bjj guides and understand the different positions and passing from one to another. If you get caught in a bad position learn 1 escape to get back to guard and then learn 1 guard sweep. As you get better you can incorporate more escapes and sweeps.
judo,33qx4r,daleech1,6,Sat Apr 25 09:17:32 2015 UTC,"When I began learning Judo, I was taught pins locks and chokes, but little to nothing about transitions like guard passing or defenses, etc. We practiced like one sloppy guard pass and a few turtle turnovers or how to attack someone lying flat on his stomach. Pins and pin escapes were the most common stuff. We just forced our way through. There was no real system and very little ""How do I get there?"" My ne-waza was forged in lots of randori. Ugly ne-waza, but at least with a great focus on controlling the opponent.  When I many, many years later, started to look into BJJ (I think comments on the Internet triggered my interest) it was a revealation. I started looking into videos, got the book ""Jiu Jitsu University"" by Saulo Ribeiro and began to refine my game.  My system is still the same: I encounter a specific problem in training, like:""What to do if my parter tries to dig his elbows in my inner tighs when I hold him in my closed guard?"" or ""I always get into that situation (halfguard for example) and don't know what to do next."" Then I focus my research on that single problem and pick up 1-3 possible solutions and experiment with them until I found what I need.  Parallel to that approach I also started training Sambo and BJJ. I am still not great at ne-waza, but compared to my former self I made a lot of progress.  So my suggestion for you would be this double approach:   Find a way to systematically built your ground game starting with the basics. Taking BJJ classes would be the best option for this. There are many finer points you won't get from reading books or watching videos. If unavailable you might look into Sambo clubs, if their ne-waza looks slick you may pick up some ideas there as well. If you want to/have to try a book instead, try Saulo Rebeiro's. There are also tons of BJJ videos on youtube, that, while often not ordered systematically, will give you ideas. This leads to approach number 2.... Tackle your problems in ne-waza one at a time. Go to training, do randori, and when you get into a situation you don't know what to make of (how to continue, attack, escape, deal with...), try to remember it and focus on finding an idea to solve it until next session. This way you might be able to solve one or two situational problems per week.

judo,33qx4r,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sat Apr 25 09:23:48 2015 UTC,awesome reply. I will definitely look into it for sure. How do you find your newaza skills now?
judo,33qx4r,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:30:07 2015 UTC,"How do you find your newaza skills now?   Improving. :)  I am much more relaxed when it comes to ne-waza randori now. In most situations I have at least a clue what approaches I could try. I run out of ideas more rarely. Transitions and submissions I have drilled work more often than before (except Sankaku Jime, the triangle choke, although I drilled it a lot I just can't get the hang on it.)"
judo,33qx4r,silvaphysh13,4,Sat Apr 25 09:48:07 2015 UTC,"At my club, we do two drills that might help you. The first we call the cage drill, which involves putting your partner is a loose mune-gatame, and letting them struggle for a couple minutes at medium intensity. As they move, try to gain a sensitivity for where the openings are as they move, and try to exploit them to your advantage. The second is basically knocking someone down in a really crude ashi-waza (mostly with their cooperation) and having them turtle. This helps simulate the often frantic scramble after a non-ippon throw. Then, have at most two or three turnover techniques in your head, and just work on diving down and slipping it in. Remember, you don't always have to win with submissions, osaekomi-waza are often overlooked."
judo,33qx4r,trumfnator,3,Fri Apr 24 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"Can you be a little bit more specific? Do you mean transition from a particular position? Guard for example? Do you mean transitioning from a pin to a submission (which is essential for general ne-waza but not that important for competition because...you already have a pin.) or do you mean Transition from tachi-waza to ne-waza?  My Newaza went over 9000 (relative to my randori partners...ne-waza is not a huge thing in my area) after training after some fundamental bjj clips from e.g. Kurt Osiander, Pedro Sauer, Jason Scully and more."
judo,33qx4r,Hippocampus88,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:33:45 2015 UTC,Well what we do is usually have the more senior members (1st dan and above) start from a prone or turtle position while us weaker players will attempt to pin or submit them.   I like the over 9000 phrase. I could imagine an imaginary ranking going up in relation to everyone else in your dojo. haha   specificity: knowing what to do when confronted with a newaza situation be it overcoming guard or from guard. I'm quite a bit of a mess at the moment. I know some moves but nothing that can link it up effectively in different situations
judo,33qx4r,aronnax512,5,Sat Apr 25 08:34:47 2015 UTC,"First of all: as a white belt, you don't need to have mastered ne-waza.  When it comes to ne-waza in Judo, there are only a couple of situations you really need to know: turtle, belly down and guard. Most things are a variation of these. ask your sensei to show some transitions/turn-overs for each of these 3 situations and you have something to try in randori. It will most likely not work on more experienced judoka, as we know the basics moves and their defenses of course. But you will develop a feeling to what brings your enemy in danger and what attack might bring you in danger. There are literally endless possibilities when it comes to attacking your enemy in ne-waza and each will only work in a specific situation (shift of weight, placement of ukes arms etc), so it takes time to find out."
judo,33qx4r,Hippocampus88,8,Fri Apr 24 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"When it comes to ne-waza in Judo, there are only a couple of situations you really need to know: turtle, belly down and guard.   I strongly disagree with this. Beginners should learn basic pins and pin escapes first. There are plenty of times where you see a waza-ari or yuko throw that lands close to some type of pin and a new player should know how to either escape or take advantage of that situation.  Turtle, belly down and guard are fairly neutral positions in shiai as it's relatively easy for the guy on the bottom to defend/stall long enough to get a standup. The guy on top has to be significantly better on the mat to be willing and able to force the action.   New players should be learning about turnovers and how to deal with/work from the guard but that's fairly deep knowledge and really won't come together until much later in their development. The basics for new players really should revolve around osaekomi."
judo,33qx4r,Hippocampus88,2,Sat Apr 25 13:13:18 2015 UTC,"I agree in general with you. If you don't know the techniques itself, there is no use in learning turn-overs as they lead nowhere.  OP already said that he is familiar with pins (and I assumed with escapes as well), he practices for 3 years now and especially asked for advice on transitions and attacks."
judo,33qx4r,dzendian,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:12:06 2015 UTC,I have been doing this for 3 years now; I never got round to doing the grading. My issue is with having a plan or knowing how to link my disparate knowledge of submissions/pins/transition in a link to deal with different situations.   How did you approach this? Did you have a set plan from which you added different paths or was it more of an organic thing?
judo,33qx4r,dzendian,1 point,Sat Apr 25 08:40:16 2015 UTC,"We just had ne-waza randori as warmup every single lesson, after some time, you just know what works when. usually you start with one or two turnovers. as uke defends these turnovers, he will open a new gap for you to hook an arm or a leg in. with this hook, you can turn him over better and then need to secure him from rolling back to his belly and can transition to a hold closest to the position you are already in.   This advice is very general, as I said there are two many variables to give specific advice for each situation. this is something your partner or trainer has to do.  MY personal ne-waza plan differs a bit as I specialised in juji-gatame from guard. that's why I personally try to shove myself under uke, but I can do the other stuff as well. that's why I wouldn't recommend such a specialized plan to a ""beginner""."
judo,33qx4r,miraoister,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:06:17 2015 UTC,"Purposefully start putting yourself into bad positions.  Allow yourself to get almost pinned.  Escape.  By being pinned and escaping, you'll learn the pins and transitioning better and then it'll get more flow-y, in my opinion."
judo,33rebc,derioderio,3,Fri Apr 24 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"Though judo can be said to be widely practiced in Japan, I would say it is not very accessible for recreational and especially beginner adults. The Kodokan would suit you needs, but it's in Tokyo. Police dojos can be great for hard and higher level drop in practice but only if you have a shoukai (personal introduction).  It's a bit like American football in America. Pretty tough to find a way to get into it as an adult."
judo,33rebc,yknik,2,Sat Apr 25 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"OK, that makes a lot of sense to me in context.  I suppose that's because it's really a professional sport more than a martial art that people do as a hobby."

Be humble and polite, and they will let you in,(you will stick out like a sore thumb, but once you are in, everything will be fine, after that, they can help you out when you go to different cities, and make the contact with other senseis and train in different dojos. Just be polite, do not be cockie, and after the training session (2 hours maybe)  everyone goes out for a drink, so that way you can get to know them. Just be really polite when you make first contact, japanese people love groups, and they love to keep foreigners or people not from their group, out of their group. Like the last guy said, Kodokan is the easiest way, its in Tokyo, they are familiar with foreigners, but in small towns the dynamic is different.

judo,33r7dg,bear-knuckle,2,Sat Apr 25 06:07:31 2015 UTC,I was being facetious. But it is a throw I'd like to learn.
judo,33r7dg,H2Outbreak,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:51:37 2015 UTC,"I hate the IJF rules with a passion.  However, I still believe morote gari is a shitty throw. It's difficult to set up, easily countered by tawara gaeshi, uke tends to land on his ass, and often with tori inside his guard.  BJJ and MMA guys like it because it's  a quick and easy way of taking the fight to the ground. But from a judo perspective, I think it's kinda meh."

judo,33r7dg,capt_hapa,3,Sat Apr 25 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"Master ogoshi and uki-goshi; they are the mold  for many (almost all) forward throws. Example - haraigoshi, hanegoshi, uchimata, ashiguruma, oguruma, tsurigoshi, koshi guruma, seoinage (yes, really), uki-otoshi (not kidding), taiotoshi (still not kidding) sode and many makikomi throws are all directly informed by either ogoshi or ukigoshi. So yes...from one (two) things, learn 10,000"

judo,33r7dg,soulscream_,2,Sat Apr 25 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"A few simple counters are always good to learn. Tani otoshi is very simple, and very easy to get right. Just make sure you don't land on your back ;). Ko and O uchi gari are usually considered foot sweeps, but can be used very effectively against most other foot sweeps and some standing throws."
judo,33r7dg,celluj34,2,Sat Apr 25 03:55:23 2015 UTC,"The word you are looking for is ""tokui-waza"", and you have to find what works for you. I think it's a good idea to have one forward throw and one backward, plus sweeps."
judo,33r7dg,JoeDwarf,2,Sat Apr 25 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"Like many have posted before, it all depends on your body type, weight class and personal preferences.   In my opinion it's important to have a good Ashi-Waza. These throws will teach you how to get your timing perfect and will require almost no strength when you've mastered them. They're fast, effortless and can done regardless of bodytype on your opponent, unlike some throws like uchi-mata which is pretty hard to when your legs are a lot shorter then your opponent.  When you're gonna look at the bigger throws, your specialised techniques will show itself. For me these are Uchi-mata, Harai-goshi and Sumi-gaeshi. For some reason I just feel way more comfortable doing these then a seoi-nage, which I've learned as one of my first throws."
judo,33r7dg,simbazz,2,Sat Apr 25 09:42:26 2015 UTC,"One of the most important throws to understand is actually tsurikomi-goshi. Not the kata variant, but regular one. This is because the tsurkomi movement with the sleeve and lapel is the foundation for a plethora of throws."
judo,33r7dg,Ryvai,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you fight and who you are fighting. Just try it during randori in your training and you will see that it depends how your enemy fights, what you prefer. For example I got some guys at my club that I always throw with a soto maki komi, but I cant manage to thrown them with a seoi-nage. And there is the totally opposite people that I only manage to ""catch"" with a seoi-nage or with something completely different.  Just try it out what suits you!  What I for example try quite often are different combinations , like uchi-mata -> kouchi-maki-komi -  or harai-goshi -> O soto gari . or seoi-nage ->kouchi maki-komi , sometimes they fall and sometimes it wont but just try :)"

A lot of Judo guys honestly just love Judo and are willing to donate their time and effort to teach others. No joke.  Not sure.  It's hard to know if a Judo group is bad or not. But I can tell you one thing for sure, don't go to a Judo class expecting to do BJJ. Judo isn't BJJ. You will surely wipe for the floor with some experienced Judo guys, but that doesn't matter. And they will probly toss you around like a rag doll. Expect to play a different game."

judo,33qyq1,pandawdy,2,Sat Apr 25 05:13:26 2015 UTC,"a lot of judo competitions offer master/newaza competitions, I've known BJJ and wrestling guys who have fought in them with little to no judo experience as far as legitimacy, I'd say you should look for schools with students who compete or who could be successful in competition. If they have competing students and train accordingly, eg lots of drilling and instruction on finer points of what will and won't work in competition, then it's likely pretty legitimate. Schools that focus much more on randori aren't necessarily illegitimate, but that type of training doesn't yield the same results as drilling and focused practice price wise I wouldn't consider that a red flag, my school is slightly more expensive. That said, I'm willing to pay that because the school offers high level training for competition, I wouldn't pay as much if all I got for it was an open mat and two hours of randori a week judo is definitely becoming more sport than anything else, and the loss of leg grabs maybe does hurt judoka fighting against wrestlers or BJJ guys. On the other hand, most of the American judoka dominating international competition (Marti Malloy, Kayla Harrison, Travis Stevens) do so with phenomenal newaza and gripping, both are skills that are highly important to grappling in general."
judo,33qyq1,Whatever_mannn,3,Fri Apr 24 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"While judo is extremely sport oriented I would argue that it is actually very good for self defense.  Throws are quite effective for self defense, and practicing them at full speed against resisting opponents makes you good at executing them.    Having an opponent that isn't expecting to be thrown makes it even easier, and most people are looking to prevent/avoid strikes or tackles while in a confrontation, not throws."
judo,33qyq1,GymIn26Minutes,2,Fri Apr 24 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"Another thing to look for, in my opinion, is a well-rounded judo club. If you find one that's focused 100% on competition, you're only getting a portion of the whole judo picture. At the very least, look for instructors who are knowledgeable about things like etiquette, kata, terminology, and judo history. Though judo as of late is primarily a sport, that is not the be-all-end-all of what it offers as a pursuit."
judo,33qyq1,silvaphysh13,2,Fri Apr 24 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"Good judo looks effortless. Take a look at how the instructors throw.

judo,33pkx9,Pyronaut44,3,Fri Apr 24 13:41:24 2015 UTC,"It actually wasn't Ippon. The description below the video reads (emphasis by me):   Remember a fight isn’t over until the bell goes. As Team Superstar’s Ushangi Margiani (GEO) demonstrated in Quarter-Final of the 2015 Tbilisi Grand Prix, when he scored a Wazari in the last second of the fight (having been down a Yuko).   Still though... it looks like yuko at best."

judo,33pkx9,Suey13,2,Fri Apr 24 13:43:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the yuko thought, it was very slow and rolled rather than impacted upon the back. That being said, it was a fairly smooth and clever transition into newaza."

If you've just started, it's probably because you're stiff. When your muscles are tense, you hemorrhage energy. Try to make a conscious effort to relax and stay loose.   Ultimately, you need experience to stay loose and comfortable, so ""do more judo"" is the best advice.

judo,33nc9d,necrotelecomnicon,4,Fri Apr 24 00:44:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I believe you need both.  When practicing judo you [should] focus on expending as little energy as possible to achieve your techniques; it's about economy of motion and conservation of strength. To increase stamina and maximum strength you need to do the exact opposite; exert yourself as much as possible to stimulate muscle growth and increased oxygen uptake.  Certainly, you will see improvements in strength and endurance while practicing judo, especially if going against heavier opponents, as someone else mentioned, but only to a certain level. Beyond that you need strength and endurance training to push you further. It also gives you ways to improve outside of classes, or when you can't go to the dojo.  Don't get me wrong though, you should still practice judo as much as possible; efficient technique beats sloppy strength. :)"

I suppose HIIT would be the only form of running that could come close, but then you're hardly using your upper body at all, and therefore not working on the anaerobic endurance of your back muscles. Maybe short distance swimming (eg. 200m) could be an alternative for varieties sake."

More that to land directly into osaekomi (pin) without over-rotating your own body you sometimes must lower your hips and straighten your posture mid throw and your feet happen to come off the ground.

judo,33ifr0,Anthony126517,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:46:53 2015 UTC,The names in Japanese are actually quite descriptive and help classify why the throws are done the way they are.    Tani otoshi translates to valley drop. Since the throw is a sutemi waza it means tori has to sacrifice their own position to achieve it. The tori's leg that slides down the back on the ground doesn't have to attack anything for it to be tani otoshi.   Traditionally it doesn't touch anything as /u/Kosoto_Gake has mentioned. (YouTube 1) (YouTube2)  However throws can be done many different ways but it's the 'concept' that determines the throw which the name often hints to.   If it was kosoto gari there'd be reaping and she wouldn't have been leading with her body on the way down.
judo,33o5qy,cheeri0so,8,Fri Apr 24 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"Sigh  Someone's trying to dig trenches again, eh? At least the title sounds like it.  Generally spoken:  BJJ usually puts more emphasis on ne-waza, judo usually puts more emphasis on tachi-waza. Many judo clubs don't teach any systematic approach to ne-waza (except one, none of those I ever visited did). BJJ gyms usually do. Average BJJ practicioners spent far more training time on the ground than average judo practitioners.   Thus it is not surprising if there is someone who intensely practiced systematically ne-waza for one or two years, still is ranked white belt (but probably has 3 or 4 stripes) and is better at ne-waza than someone who spent like 6 years of occasionally practicing ne-waza without a systematic approach.  Anyway, we don't know anything about those two guys in the video. How many hours per week do they train? Do they only practice BJJ or Judo? Do they crosstrain in other arts? If yes, for how long? What about their physical condition? Talent? Shape of the day? Are their instructors good or not? How easy/hard is it to get a graduation from them?  In the end it boils down to this: The better fighter wins. And the style is just one of many, many other factors like experience, rules, circumstances and others.  Comparing arts to each other and saying ""this one is better than that one"" is kind of childish and immature.  Judo, BJJ, Sambo... I like them all. :P"

Just a quick question, probably a dumb one, what is everyone saying in Japanese? For example at the beginning of class, we kneel and bow to the sensei (I think they say sensei-ni? and then we bow to each other or at least towards each other, and then a picture of Jigoro Kano, I think) and there's also a kind of chant at the beginning of class? Like someone says ""Ichi"" and the class responds, and then some other stuff I haven't caught on to. And what do we say when we bow? I think at the beginning of randori we say ""onagoshi mas""? and then after we say something similar but I'm not sure. Sorry for the noob questions, I just want to get the hang of things!"

Sensei-Ni (to your head sensei) and Shomani (Jigoro Kano), followed by a ""Rei"" (""bow"")   I think at the beginning of randori we say ""onagoshi mas""?

judo,33hgef,saatanansaatana,3,Wed Apr 22 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"The literal translation for ""onegai shimasu"" would be ""I'm making a wish"", but the meaning is closer to ""please grant my wish"". So in a way, it's simply expressing your trust in your training partner and their will to try their best during the training.  However, due to fundamental differences in grammar, there is no way of translating the phrase literally in a way that would also carry the exact same meaning without an explanation."

judo,33hgef,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"Kamiza:       Kamiza (上座 ?) is the Japanese language term referring to the ""top seat"" within a room, meaning the place of honor; the term also applies to the best seats in air-planes, trains, and cars. The antonym, meaning ""bottom seat,"" is shimoza (下座). In a room, the kamiza is the seat or position that is most comfortable, usually furthest from the door -- because this is warmest, and was safest from attack back in the feudal period. In a traditional washitsu room it would often be a zabuton placed so the person sitting there has his back to the tokonoma; the kamiza is the spot closest to the tokonoma or simply farthest from the door in a room lacking a tokonoma. In a Western-style room it would be a comfortable armchair or sofa, or the head of a table. The term is general, and does not only apply to Japanese culture.

judo,33hgef,Ryvai,2,Fri Apr 24 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"It seems like your dojo is very traditional, and there's nothing wrong with that. Personally I like it, as it contains tons of respect. At the beginning and end of class there's always a bow (rei). When they say; sensei-ni-rei, it means something along the lines of; 'bow to the sensei'. It just a gesture of showing respect to the teacher. When you bow to the picture of jigoro kano one usually says; 'shihan-ni-rei', but i've heard 'shomen-ni-rei' as well. I've not seen many preporatory chants before the rei, but I have seen some clubs saying 'za!' then 'rei', as in 'zarei', where the 'za' means you should posture up and look presentable with respect before the 'rei'. When someone says 'onegaishimasu' before randori it is a gesture of mutual respect. It means something along the lines of; 'may we prosper together'. It's like, you take care of me and I'll take care of you. It is very 'jita-kyoei', or mutual prosperity, if you will. You should bow in reply and achknowledge it, it's a very respectful thing to say."

judo,33hgef,PoachedEggsOnToast,4,Wed Apr 22 18:45:41 2015 UTC,From what I've noticed/heard the Japanese tend to be more traditional and their throws are often in the kodakan style (kaeshiwazaki). The Russians and Georgians often have wrestling backgrounds and tend to make bigger throws and often lack a ground game (tchrikishvili). My sensei (GB) has described the French as sneaky. They tend to be very fast and have both mean foot sweeps and a deadly ground game (loic pietri). I would also say Mongolian judo seems to be very similar to Georgian style judo.

judo,33hgef,BootsLikeMafia,3,Wed Apr 22 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"From my time training in Japan, and the hours upon hours of competition I've watched in person and on the internet, Japanese fighters tend to favour more classic throws with less esoteric grip variations. Of course this is a generalization, but you'll see Japanese fighters throw a lot of morote/ippon seoi nage, uchi mata, and harai goshi, along with strong ashi waza. They aren't so into throwing the Georgian, pick-up style Ura Nage or throws that rely on a lot of strength. Also, their fighters who are good at ground work are very methodical. Which is not to say that other international fighters aren't, but the Japanese grow up going to schools that focus on judo, and it's drilled into them at an early age. A lot of Japanese fighters Like Ono, Inoue, Takano, etc., really like going for throws that score ippon. They don't seem to rely on winning by shido or minor point scoring strategies as much as continental fighters.  Again, these are all generalizations, but I think they have some merit to them."

Later, when I continued (about 7 years ago) with much greater motivation than in my youth, I chose the wrong place to practice. I spent some years in a dojo, where I had big trouble finding a partner to practice with for a dan exam. No one wanted to practice kata, especially the dan holders there didn't want to. Anyways... over the years I spent there I realized how limited and flawed the knowledge of my ""masters"" was. I started looking elsewhere for information of theoretical and practical nature and began improving my technique using new found sources. Much to their dislike. Interestingly I probably wouldn't know what I do know now, if their shortcomings hadn't forced me to help myself. I can say that my practical abilities and theoretical knowledge are greater than theirs, not because I am so good, far from it, but because they are so bad. Let me put it this way: in the end, shortly before I cut my ties with them, I didn't even want a black belt from them anymore, since it would have been meaningless, as much as the little federation they belong to.  Now I practice at a different place with no affilation to any federation at all, which means I cannot get graded there, but at least my new sensei is openminded, competent and so much better than me, that I have trouble to stay on my feet for more than a few seconds, which I am thankful for."

I'm very small in comparison to almost everybody that I train with at 165cm and 59kg (5' 4"" and 130lb), and I find that the beginning of ne-waza I am invariably forced down into a turtle position from which I am effectively useless until I can find a way out, which only really happens with partners of similar or lesser experience than me.  So, my question is: what do I do?  I get the feeling my best bet would be to pull guard every time, but I feel as though this is contrary to the general spirit of judo groundwork as it is inherently defensive, I would like to avoid doing this unless you guys can convince me there's nothing wrong with it. I've tried trying to jump into shime- or kansetsu-waza with varying degrees of success, noting that after it's worked once, the probability of it working afterwards has dropped markedly. Shime-waza in particular seem quite ineffective when they begin with both of us kneeling upright, as I still end up on my back, even if I have a grip of the lapel.   Simply trying to brute force my opponent backwards or sideways into a favourable position works very rarely, as one would imagine, but I've had a little bit of success converting their efforts to move me into a roll where I end in a favourable position.  That's a summary of all I've tried so far. Anything I should focus on or haven't thought of?"

As a starter bring both your feet to the inside of your opponents thighs sit up and hug your opponent tight with an under over hook and roll backwards. As you both roll extend the leg on the under hook side and roll sideways to the side of the bent leg. Shrug your opponent off and switch your hips into kusure kesa gatame.

If they try to push your head down, shoot* and force them to go into guard, and do your passes from there (or try to catch them with sode guruma jime). If you roll with leg-locks you can go for that as well; kata-ashi-hishigi variations are the easiest from that position.  *Always be on your toes (literally) when starting from the knees, so you can push off quickly when you need to."

There is a line between entertaining and nonsense BUT this one was clearly at the side of entertaining with content and surprise and creativity.  There was a time, when Judo had some ""magic"" in the west (up to the 70's) and its a pitty, that these times are gone. Like in chess the audience mostly doesnt understand the effort, mastery and subtility which is included in good Judo so Judo demonstrations should be like this 4 man cereographed performance, to entertain, surprise and enjoy.  ."
judo,33gjop,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:11:11 2015 UTC,"I remember when I took some karate at my university (my first experience with proper martial arts instruction) my instructor told us not to be intimidated by the movements of the kata we had to learn, because doing kata is just like dancing. Find the rhythm, drill the repetition, and your body can perform any kata in time.   I had no idea what she was talking about (since I had no prior dance experience either) but she ended up being right. I see that in this video: choreographed rhythmic movements, and done with a partner no less. It reminds me of capoeira, where the line between dance and the more martial aspects of it can be quite blurry. Or Aikido; some of the demonstrations look quite dance-y with how graceful and flowing the movements can be."

judo,33ffd8,udegarami53,5,Wed Apr 22 02:08:34 2015 UTC,"Some of Zantaraia's prefered techniques are hard to classify.  This technique intesects with the principles of three different throws: Tani Otoshi, Ura Nage and Yoko Gake. In any way we can say it is a yoko sutemi waza, a sacrifice technique with tori falling to his side.  Why this could be Tani Otoshi:  Tori steps partially behind uke and throws him towards his back.  Why this could be Ura Nage:  Tori's final stance is close to the side of uke with both feet on the ground and lowered hips. He hangs himself onto uke and pushes his hips forward to give the technique more snap.  Why this could be Yoko Gake:  Since tori uses his leg to block the leg of uke instead of extending it ""to throw his weight"" into the direction of the throw, this is a tiny bit more like the mechanical principle of yoko gake than tani otoshi.  Personally I'd put it in the Ura Nage category, but considering the observsations listed above, I could be wrong."
judo,33ffd8,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:26:32 2015 UTC,"My thoughts upon first seeing it were that it is a weird yoke gake, for the leg-blocking aspect."
judo,33ffd8,zaccbruce,2,Wed Apr 22 13:04:24 2015 UTC,"One of my coaches showed us that throw, and said ""like ura-nage"". My coaches are often vague about technique names/classifications."
judo,33ffd8,Ryvai,2,Wed Apr 22 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"As I've mentioned before, Kodokan terminology is not perfect and it can sometimes be difficult to fit a modern technique into a category of principle. In this case I believe this is a form of ura-nage. The gist of ura-nage is that tori lifts uke up and attempt to throw him backwards, in part sacrificing himself in the process. It is mainly classified as ma-sutemi-waza (supine sacrifice throw), however most  sutemi-waza has variations that are ma- and yoko. Take hikikomi-gaeshi for example, it has several variations that are yoko-sutemi-waza. In the case of zantaraia's throw he closes the distance, goes slightly behind uke to lift him up and throw backwards. There is no 'otoshi' in this technique, uke is lifted and thrown backwards."

judo,33cgsd,Geschichtenerzaehler,19,Tue Apr 21 12:09:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with atemi waza in judo is it is just like grappling techniques in TKD. They aren't practiced in a live scenario so they are essentially worthless. I've had a 3rd dan in TKD tell me that there are some throws and grappling techniques that are part of tkd. I wanted to laugh. Certainly many schools address some, but there is little emphasis and much less expertise. This is why I put a huge disclaimer whenever discussing atemi waza in judo. Atemi waza is a very small part of judo, and i think the best response to people asking if there are strikes in judo is ""kind of, but not really"". While they are acknowledged, the efficacy of strikes trained without a sparring scenario pale in comparison to those which are, in my opinion. And yes, I do understand that the practice of the sport/martial art does not define Judo, but not addressing how the world is actually practicing Judo would be very disingenuous."
judo,33cgsd,judokalinker,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:40:59 2015 UTC,"They aren't practiced in a live scenario so they are essentially worthless.   Yes, that's a big problem.   This is why I put a huge disclaimer whenever discussing atemi waza in judo. Atemi waza is a very small part of judo, and i think the best response to people asking if there are strikes in judo is ""kind of, but not really"".   That's a honest position. While I like to rise awareness of Judo's options and potential beyond a mere sport, I tell newbies, that few judoka ever look into atemi waza and that expertise in the matter is rarely found. There are national and federational differences though, thus I don't want to generalize too much.  I agree with you, that it is necessary to point out what the club/training/instructor has actually to offer and what it is realistically good for."

However... while it's technically true that judo includes strikes, realistically speaking, you're unlikely to get effective training in striking while learning judo. I have read that Kano wanted to develop rules allowing atemi to be used in randori, but obviously that never happened. I wonder what that would have looked like."

Another rumor I cannot confirm at the moment is, that at the Butokukai, the greatest rival school to the Kodokan, atemi were practiced in full contact sparring for some time shortly before or during the war.  I know of a small circle of Judoka who practice judo that way (bare knuckle full contact) from time to time, but I had no chance to take a look at their atemi technique or randori yet.

judo,33cgsd,H2Outbreak,6,Tue Apr 21 21:39:49 2015 UTC,"The part I find most amusing is that even if those things didn't exist judo would still have extremely dangerous techniques.    Throws are extremely dangerous to people who don't know how to break fall, and even dangerous to those that do know break falls on many surfaces.    With a little adjustment to drive them down head/neck first you could cripple someone with a well executed uchi mata."
judo,33cgsd,fedornuthugger,4,Tue Apr 21 18:57:27 2015 UTC,I would argue that a solid throw on a hard surface would be devastating no matter how good you are with ukemi. This is particularly the case since a competent throw would mean that the tori has control.   Didn't some show or another do a test on judo throws and determined that an uchimata or something on a hard surface was equivalent to getting hit by a car at 30-50mph?

Tachi-waza and ne-waza challenging enough to master. With a finite amount of time, does it make sense for judoka to start incorporating striking as part of judo training? Most judo senseis are not qualified to teach effective atemi waza  One point of view would be to learn atemi waza outside of judo in arts that specialize in striking (boxing, muy thai) and don't mess with judo curriculum (~75/25) tachi/ne waza. But this argument can be even taken further to apply to newaza... train BJJ for newaza and narrow judo's focus to standing. Ultimately, this path leads to what the OP stated:   The problem is, that techniques, that aren't allowed within the restrictive competition rules, are soon neglected, omitted and finally forgotten (the recently banned leg grab techniques are threatened by this situation as well).   Sport has the potential to dilute and change the art, but the art needs the sport to validate its effectiveness.  I have no point or answers. I have questions."

I cannot say, because I think it depends on the individual Judoka. If you want to be a top competitor, you don't have any time to waste on techniques you may not use and it might also prove a problem if you automatise movements such as leg grabs. Such a reflex can get you disqualified. If you are interested in complete judo at least dabbling in ""forbidden"" techniques now and then might be a welcome change and might keep training from getting dull. If self-defense is your goal, you should spent a significant ammount of your training time practicing the necessary parts of judo, including atemi-waza.  A club should offer its participants the opportunity to chose their path after a certain point. As life, judo should be what you want to make out of it.   Most judo senseis are not qualified to teach effective atemi waza   This is one of the biggest obstacles of course.   One point of view would be to learn atemi waza outside of judo in arts that specialize in striking (boxing, muy thai)    This is probably the best option, if the judo training doesn't offer the time or expertise necessary.   Sport has the potential to dilute and change the art, but the art needs the sport to validate its effectiveness.   I consider sport judo an important and necessary part of judo. We just have to keep in mind (and offer) the other options that exist.  That's one reason why I wrote this article.  Many people who enter a judo club for the first time come to learn self-defense, but sport judo doesn't provide this, at least not the complete package. This drives away a lot of possible future judoka. I assume that's one of the reasons why judo is a declining art in Germany.   I have no point or answers. I have questions.   I know that problem all too well."

judo,33cgsd,fozzit,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on why you're doing judo probably. If you're doing it to win competition or stay fit, forget striking. If you're doing for self-defense, you're not really learning it unless you practice strikes, at least defensively.  I'm a BJJ guy and the same debate exists here, but much more loudly, because BJJ is much more closely linked with MMA and has a recent street-fighting history. However, there's added flexibility there - people who want to fully incorporate striking just go to an MMA school, which virtually always incorporates both striking and submission grappling, usually BJJ.  We (at a more traditional BJJ school) do, however, still practice original Gracie striking defense techniques as part of the regular curriculum. Not enough, I'd say, that we could consider ourselves experts at street fighting, but enough that we could probably survive haymakers, and get around to taking down and submitting a typical untrained asshole. Many people that only care about sport BJJ don't care much for these, but I think they're vital to preserving the nature of the art. Once in a while, we even put gloves on and go full speed, although the punches are supposed to stay quarter to half power at most. One of my favorite drills, actually."

judo,33bpkm,Judostu,3,Tue Apr 21 22:21:51 2015 UTC,"it's actually more of a block than a sweep, the same goes for Hiza Guruma but I get your point about them being effective throws that allows tori to remain standing afterwards"
judo,33bpkm,silvaphysh13,4,Wed Apr 22 08:34:54 2015 UTC,"I second the o-soto-gari comment, it's my understanding that it's the most heavily utilized combat throw by the Toyko Police force."

judo,33bpkm,onehungrybear,2,Tue Apr 21 14:35:13 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to know why you're curious about this.   First off, I don't recommend judo for fighting multiple opponents. I don't recommend you get in that situation to begin with, but, with my limited knowledge, I would say any grappling style isn't suited outside of one-on-one settings. It just requires so much time and big movements to execute techniques - you'd be open to getting hit by a second opponent all the time.   Having said that, my vote would be osoto-gari. It's incredibly simple to pull off, you don't need as much space, you don't expose your back, falling with the opponent will often land you in an advantageous, top position, and the throw can be absolutely brutal.   Here's a great example by one of the best in the game today: https://youtu.be/FfmRciXVlTI"
judo,33bpkm,Hotguy657,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think my question was misunderstood. I don't plan on getting into any situation where I will need to fight any single opponent, let alone multiple ones.   I wanted to know what moves intermediate-advanced practitioners / experienced judoka usually end up choosing, and how they pull it off in a competition.   Thanks for the link, that was the kind of example of I was looking for."
judo,33bpkm,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:52:29 2015 UTC,"I did, indeed, misunderstand your question. So you can ignore my comment, but my answer is still the same! Osoto-gari is probably the first or second throw every judoka learns, and it remains in most of our arsenals throughout our ""careers."""
judo,33bpkm,SWEPOW,2,Tue Apr 21 19:15:35 2015 UTC,For me I would say tani otoshi. As a counter I can almost always nail someone with it as soon as they turn in and land in an advantaged position.

judo,33bpkm,ShinshinRenma,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:12:29 2015 UTC,"flashy moves as in wrist-to-arm locks, the leg locks that require a judoka to quickly use both legs on an opponent while balancing with his arm on the ground at the right moment , stuff like that.   What i was looking for was more of the simple ones that are not so complicated to use."
judo,33bpkm,sasquatch007,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:08:24 2015 UTC,I don't think i've ever seen a move like that in Judo. Are you thinking of BJJ? They tend to be a bit more flashy.
judo,338teb,fleischlaberl,12,Mon Apr 20 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"It is an important skill to cultivate. Specifically, efficacious grip-fighting should lead you closer to a technique with every successful adjustment. It can be easy to distract yourself fighting for your ideal grip just so you have it. If you have no idea or plan of what to do once you get there, a lot of time and energy is wasted for no gain."
judo,338teb,wingingitman,2,Mon Apr 20 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is, because Judoka are so focused on their tokui waza, so they need specific conditions to get into ""their throw"". But Judo has endless possibilities and you allways get a grip on the opponent. If you have a solid homebase in center of gravity and body movement, why do you need a specific grip?  No critics, just some questions and open to learn. I am in heavy weight division so maybe there is also a  difference to the lighter categories.  ."
judo,338teb,wingingitman,6,Mon Apr 20 19:07:44 2015 UTC,"I would agree, it is not about any given grip and focusing too heavily on a single grip can be detrimental. My approach to kime kata is that each step in the series of grips I take opens up a different ""set"" of techniques for me, while helping to shut-down a ""set"" of techniques for my opponent. I can move forward in the sequence, I can move backward, at some points I can jump to a different place entirely. All of this gets adjusted based on your opponents movements and how they counter your grips. Certainly I can attempt nearly any throw from nearly any grip, but one of the purposes of judo is to find the easiest, most efficient way to do that.  On top of all of that you have to be thinking about how your grips force your opponent to move and counter and how you will have to move and counter in return. It is sort of like a dialogue, or a debate. You are attempting to control the conversation and come to a resolution that you want. It is one of the more strategic elements of judo.  Training kime kata is important because it helps contribute to your understanding of what makes a throw work and why in a large variety of situations. If you focus on what you're doing and don't just grip randomly that knowledge can be applied to other aspects of judo. Eventually all of this gets locked in your head and you can do it reflexively."

judo,338teb,silvaphysh13,9,Mon Apr 20 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Excessive focus on grip fighting early in a judokas career can really hamper their technical development. I think it is a good idea for all judoka below blue belt to start most randori sessions with both participants already in neutral standard grip.  Whilst it is obviously an essential component of success in Judo, I am of the opinion that grip fighting should be one of the final pieces of the puzzle, not the first.  I also think it is worth distinguishing between grip fighting and gripping in general. How to grip correctly and why gripping different parts of your partners gi allows you to control them in different ways or facilitates different techniques should be taught early and often.  Fighting for grips and various gripping sequences to get what you prefer are important, yes, but should be saved for later."
judo,338teb,dave_attenburz,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I'm of the opinion that a judoka should endeavor to develop responses to any grip, and let their opponent grab on right off the bat. The demo I use constantly with beginners shows why: I have them grab onto me, as tightly as they can, and tell them not to let go. Then, I completely release my grip, step back and pivot, and throw them with sasae. I think there's often way too much time and energy spent on trying to break your opponents grip, that could instead be spent on responding to it."
judo,338teb,nicekid81,2,Mon Apr 20 17:10:49 2015 UTC,I don't completely disagree but the first goal has to be establish your own grip. Judo is an offensive system and imposing your grip is the first step to mounting an attack.  If you fail in imposing your own grip then I absolutely agree that you should be able to still work from a disadvantageous position.
judo,338teb,aronnax512,10,Mon Apr 20 18:50:30 2015 UTC,It's 80% of who wins.
judo,338teb,Ryvai,3,Mon Apr 20 16:54:20 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate? Why? Give some examples?  .
judo,338teb,KarateCowboy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:01:22 2015 UTC,Having dominant grips means I can throw you but you really can't throw me without breaking my dominant grip (not easy to do).  There's a reason so many dominant grips have been banned or severely restricted.
judo,338teb,langoustine,3,Tue Apr 21 01:34:59 2015 UTC,"It's a way of bringing the odds in your favor. On competitive high level it is often what determines who wins, because both judoka are usually very skilled at waza, whoever get's the perfect grip first will have the advantage and thus win. Judo is all about the opportunity to attack and apply waza, having the dominant grip opens more windows than not to do so. The question then rises, is it a good idea for relatively young judoka to focus on it? It 'can' inhibit bio-mechanical understanding or feeling the opportunity arise, but then again by knowing some kumi-kata one will discover new ways to apply waza. I consider it to be one of the fundamental things to learn, but should not be the main focus, by any means."
judo,338teb,KarateCowboy,4,Mon Apr 20 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"The significance of grip and fighting for it is partly why no-gi is so popular in sister BJJ. IIRC a fellow recently asked Eddie Bravo if he would consider a gi competition in the next year, and he responded ""Absolutely not. The world wants submissions not tug-of-war"". That says a lot about how important grip fighting is when wearing a gi."
judo,338teb,fedornuthugger,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"Grip fighting still occurs in no-gi and wrestling. Obviously there's less, but one can stall forever with gripping in any rule set."
judo,338teb,KarateCowboy,-1,Mon Apr 20 21:40:59 2015 UTC,"I can't quite put my finger on it, but for some reason gripping the actual body seems different than grabbing a sleeve or collar."
judo,338teb,fedornuthugger,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:45:20 2015 UTC,I think it says more about how - submission grapplers want to transition to MMA (where the money is) - where skills learnt when fighting in the GI is of little benefit.

judo,338v87,aronnax512,3,Tue Apr 21 06:02:33 2015 UTC,"It's perfectly legal, as it does attack the elbow joint. If you ride out the pain your elbow will separate. There's severe discomfort due to compressing the flesh but it's an armlock, they don't feel good. If you don't like it, tap."
judo,338v87,judokid78,2,Tue Apr 21 01:39:37 2015 UTC,"From what i have been told it is illegal. However, almost no referee is going to know that it is even a submission, so it's legal in that regard. Most judo players won't tab either because they won't recognize the move and will continue to fight despite the pressure on the biceps. It is dangerous because you can actually tear your opponents biceps tendon. It's a good way to sweep your opponent from guard though."
judo,338v87,aronnax512,2,Mon Apr 20 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"We regularly train them at my club, it's a reaction to people that develop a death grip on their gi as a defense to juji."

According to some youtube video description, it was a favourite of neil adams, which would presumably make it a legal technique (although youtube video descriptions are not reliable sources).  I have also asked a former nation kids coach, a former international competitor, and my sensei (who has practised for around 40 years). They all said it was legal, although a bit mean."

One suggestion I might make for the first fight is unless sacrifice throws are your tokui waza, try not to rely on them as much. They're generally really low percentage throws and can get you in a really bad position if there's little to no kuzushi. If you are gonna try them, try setting them up with ashi waza or circling. Too many guys get into a situation where they're essentially standing still and then try to go for a lackluster tomoe nage.  Keep it up though!!"

Wrestling can probably be substituted with Judo under the old rules. I mean grappling is grappling. The techniques generally evolve to be the same given the same rules. Just we do have different rules and BJJ+wrestling due to the lack of gi fits better with the MMA ruleset.

judo,3381v7,dermatix,2,Mon Apr 20 11:36:05 2015 UTC,"I love the quote; ""Sometimes a good offense is the best defense"". I think it suits Judo pretty well. Defensive techniques is called 'bogyo-waza' in Judo. Furthermore; attack initiative is called 'mitsu-no-sen', which divides into three categories; sen-sen-no-sen, sen, and go-no-sen. I've uploaded a picture for you, of an outtake from T. Daigo's book Kodokan Throwing Techniques that explains these principles. 'Bogyo-waza' falls into the category of go-no-sen. If you can predict an opponent coming in for an attack, that is step one of launching a successful counter-attack, which already shows insight. There have been made several unofficial kata that demonstrates these principles, namely go-no-sen-no-kata, and I think you can find some inspiration in these. Here's an example. Good luck."
judo,3381v7,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:42:48 2015 UTC,"Focus on natural, upright posture  (shizen tai) Move yourself and your opponent with your feet and your COG (center of gravity). Dont spend much time on grips and tricks. Focus on feeling of balance and unbalance. There are eight directions to throw and not only one or two. be decisive: If you see the opportunity go ""all in"" watch higher grades doing randori. If they are good, they don't waste much energy and the technique is smooth. Think about, why it is smooth.   last: you can not allways progress and its normal to have plateaus.

judo,3381v7,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:14:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that the basis should be a stable shizen-tai posture, but knowing when to change from shizen- to jigo-tai is just as important, in my opinion. Defending hip-throws are mostly done by an upright posture and pressing the hip forward, turning slightly, but I take it that was just an example from his part.  I like that you brought up COG, or use of 'hara'. I usually express this by explaining that there is a skateboard under your feet and your COG should never go outside the area of the ""skateboard"". What do you think of this analogy?  Everytime I've reached a plateau, my solution have been to study something else and focus on that. At 3.kyu I was struggling with my right-handed throws, I seemed to not pull them off anymore, but then I decided to try left-handed stance, and that opened up a whole new world for me and got my out of the 'bad circle'. I made many discoveries that way and it really improved my Judo :)"
judo,3381v7,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:59:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that the basis should be a stable shizen-tai posture, but knowing when to change from shizen- to jigo-tai is just as important, in my opinion.   I agree.  First and most important is natural upright posture. From there you can do allmost everthing. Its an open position to attack and to defend and you are centered ""feet-cog-shoulders-head"" and your center of gravity is within the support of cog. There can be moments in randori/shiai were you have to change to jigo-tai to defend.  If somebody who is just one year in Judo asks for advice to progress, I only give general answers, because the basics are so important.  If you are more advanced there are a lot of possibilities to open up the mind if you are stuck in custom habits. Even Yamashita was given an advice by Sato, that he should do/learn something completely new, when Yamashita was at the top of his game.  ."
judo,3381v7,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"The reason you can suddenly see throws coming is experience. The reason you can't seem to put together a defense is lack of experience. Which seems perfectly representative of someone who's been in it for a year. You are beginning to enter the equivalent of the awkward teen years of judo.  There's a lot of good advice in the other responses here, but I'll throw in my 2 cents anyway. If someone can see a throw, but not stop it, I find it may mean they are anticipating the contact and tensing or overreacting. My advice would be to relax and not care whether or not you fall. You probably have enough experience that falling no longer intimidates you, but it sounds like you're still really actively trying to avoid the falls. Just keep moving and go to your next attack. If you fall, who cares? You'll get some solid ukemi practice.  Once I stopped worrying about falling, I fell less. My randori got smoother and I felt like I was working less for better results. I also got fewer injuries. Although the caveat to all of that is that all of those changes could be explained by me simply putting more time in on the mat and getting better. I will say when I give this advice to the players I coach, they seems to have similar results."

As a reminder for beginners:  http://judoinfo.com/randori.htm   There is no winner or loser in randori, so focus on attacking freely without regard for being thrown. Relax and retain free movement of your body and mind. Keep your arms loose. Hold on lightly, but don't let go. Follow through with each technique. Don't get in the habit of going in half way. Follow-up each technique with another. Never refuse a practice partner. Seek out those partners who are better than you. Try new tricks. Keep the balls of your feet on the mat. Kiai for extra power. Keep control of your breathing.   .  .  ."

Work on your grip fighting - drill the first 10 seconds of grip fighting over and over with someone much better than you and ask for continuous feedback. Sometimes you think too much about the throws and forget that if you lose the grip fighting battle you'l never get a chance to counter or throw in the first place.

judo,335uhw,fintip,4,Mon Apr 20 03:40:57 2015 UTC,"when I first started judo they made me roll around in a corner -by myself- for six weeks until I got my ukemi down. only then was I allowed to play with the other students. At the time I was indignant, but now I realize that ukemi is the most important white-belt skill.    here we have a guy who doesn't know how to get thrown, being thrown by a guy who doesn't know how to throw someone safely. Tori cares more about winning than his opponent/training partner's safety.  I do not want to sound condescending, or discouraging of either the grapplers involved or the sport of BJJ, but I would highlight the ways in which BJJ could improve its strategy for practice and competition. This video could have easily been an debilitating injury, or even fatal and that is bad for all martial arts.   ukemi first."
judo,335uhw,Paladin_PDX,2,Mon Apr 20 04:54:39 2015 UTC,I think takedowns and throws being allowed in BJJ but takedowns and more importantly breakfalls not be emphasized at low levels causes a higher risk of injury needlessly.

judo,335uhw,Omittedlucidity,7,Sun Apr 19 21:03:20 2015 UTC,"Tori dropped to his knee after he had uke in the air, and drove him headfirst into the ground. He wasn't trying to land his opponent on their back as you would in Judo, and for that matter this throw would not have scored. He was most likely trying to get himelf low to the ground so he could engage on the mat. It's a good instinct to have in BJJ, but he's lucky he didn't seriously injure his opponent with his poor execution.   That being said, tori had good timing and he took advantage of the situation. It was his lack of technique was the downfall."

His guidance of uke was bad. That was a koryu worthy kill throw, but should not happen in competition.  And it is very likely that uke now suffers from a concussion. The effects often don't show immediatly but hours later.  EDIT: Forgot a word."
judo,335uhw,fleischlaberl,0,Mon Apr 20 07:37:00 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree.  You dont have to look at the end of the throw - uke landing on his head - you have to look from starting on. Uke tries to do some sloppy o soto gari (with no tension of his center) and tori takes this sloppy movement and turns immediatly in (sen sen no sen) a seoi nage/seoi o toshi and like in a well executed seoi lit. ""takes uke on his back"". At this point the throw is over for uke - he has no chance to block or to counter. The only responsibility for uke from that moment on is to take his fall properly. But what does uke do at this moment? He doesnt ""go round with his body by tucking his chin and rounding his shoulders etc."" - he stretches his body and gets stiff and sticks his head out ... Its ukes fault - not toris - that uke is landing on his head.  By the way - the throw was not so powerfull. It only looks like ""powerfull"" because tori used the momentum of uke (the sloppy o soto gari).  ."
judo,335uhw,academicninja,2,Mon Apr 20 09:23:42 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more. Timing was well done and the power was there but the the technique was not. Power drove it, not technique.   Tucking his chin would have done nothing as there was no room left for him to land on his back. Now if tori had turned and tucked the circle could have been completed.   Competition is not worth head trauma and saying Uke has to take his breakfalls, in this instance, seems akin to victim blaming."
judo,335uhw,fintip,2,Mon Apr 20 07:53:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you were downvoted. If uke had tucked his head, he would have rolled to his back. Dropping a knee to the ground is acceptable variation of technique that happens in Judo competitions all the time. Getting low to the ground is good Judo, both in terms of elevation shifting and getting ready for the groundwork--which you should be doing in Judo as well.  Are you seriously saying that would not have scored? Definitely looks scorable to me. One of our black belts commented that this was definitely a legit throw and all on uke. I strongly agree."
judo,335uhw,academicninja,2,Mon Apr 20 03:44:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, IMO. Tori never tucked or turned to allow uke to fall on his back. It was straight over and down. There was simply no room, IMO, for uke to breakfall properly.   Don't get me wrong, dropping a knee is fine but if he drops and extends outward like he did, without completing the kuzushi circle or turning it sends Uke facefirst to head-trauma land."

The throw was a well executed seoi otoshi and uke had plenty of time to tuck his chin and take a fall properly. There can be two reasons, that he didn't tuck his chin: First, that he didn't want to take the throw second that he had no clue about proper break falling. I think it was the second. If I am going to competition I have to trust my opponent, that he did learn proper Judo/BBJ and that I don't bring him in danger with proper and well executed throws.   ."
judo,335uhw,academicninja,2,Mon Apr 20 09:09:42 2015 UTC,"I watched the vid several times and I just disagree with your analysis. First of all, it was a crap throw because uke landed on his face. In Judo we are trained to score by throwing on the back not the head....so just not a good throw by judo standards.  Tori has primary control over the trajectory and velocity of a throw.   Based on what I saw, the positioning wasn't right for a seoiotoshi and there was no follow through by Tori to allow uke to land on his back. That final tiny circle at the end (or turn) by Tori is what would allow uke to fall safely (regardless of Uke's poor ukemi). There was simply no room for Uke to call well -- tori extended him outward and didnt tuck at  the end.   I am trying to review the vid again to see what you're seeing but it seems its been pulled.  A slow motion gif would be handy for further analysis."

At any rate, I think I phrased things badly to give others the idea to misconstrue what I was trying to convey. What I meant originally is that the concept of applying a rank, whether or not it's accurate, to Kano was to quantify that he was the true master of judo. Understandably, he didn't assign himself a grade, but he was the sensei to others and so forth. To say he doesn't have a rank is a bit hard to consider, because anyone who hasn't begun the process of learning judo could also be considered to have no rank. That would put Kano on the same level as any someone with literally no experience, and that would be worse than considering him to have a higher rank.  I've also read conflicting sources that say that an 11th and 12th dan exist but (obviously) have never been awarded. Do you have any information about those?"
judo,3345nv,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Most of the answers are hidden within the passage I already quoted here:   Since there is no limit on the amount one can progress and improve due to the study of the complete Judo, there is theoretically no limit on the grade one can receive. Therefore if one does reach a stage above 10th Dan, and, here it must be stressed that the philosophical aspects of Judo with a complete understanding of the principle of ""Maximum-Efficiency and Mutual Welfare and Benefit"" would be more than essential, there is no reason why he should not be promoted to 11th Dan. If he should be of such mettle as to deserve further recognition he would be raised to 12th Dan and given the title of Shihan, which until now has only been applied to our founder. Shihan would be more the equivalent of ""Doctor"" or ""Pastmaster"" although there is no word in English which describes fully the meaning of this word when applied to a person such as we describe. A further idea of Kano Shihan is that when one reaches this stage, one transcends such things as colours and grades and therefore returns to a white belt, thereby completing the full circle of Judo, as of life. For the purposes of recognition, however, it has been decided that the white belt worn by a Shihan should be about twice as wide as the ordinary belt, so that there is no chance of a beginner, for example, making a terrible mistake.   Thus there is theoretically no limit to dan grades. An 11th dan would be truely exceptional though. A 12th dan even more so, that the he could be considered equal with the only Shihan of Judo, Jigoro Kano. That's the only rank Kano holds in Judo: Shihan, the explanation is hinted at in the quote.  Anyway, only 15 people have ever been ranked 10th dan in the history of the Kodokan. Other Judo federations/institutions have ranked some Judoka 10th dan in some rare (and sometimes controversial) cases. No one ever got a dan grade above the 10th.  Although it would be theoretically possible to rank someone beyond that, it's considered unlikely, since it would be seen as a devaluation of the 10th dan holders. You can consider it a taboo."

judo,3345nv,judokalinker,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:23:23 2015 UTC,"CK spielte ein wenig Lazarus und ist im deutschen Judoforum kurz aufgetaucht und hat dort - wie immer ex cathedra ganz beiläufig aus seinem Gedächtnis ... ;-) - auf einen Beitrag geantwortet mit dem Thema ""Wieviele Dan Grade gibt es?"".   Zitat CK:  ""The situation about the existing dan-ranks as described in this thread is not correct. Kanō Jigorō determine determined the following, as expressed in his own words in the only jūdō book he ever wrote, (Kanō Jigorō (嘉納治五郎). Jūdō kyōhon jōkan (柔道教範 上潘) [A textbook of jūdō]. Tōkyō: Shushiki Kaisha; 1931, p. 7 [in Japanese]):  From shodan to 5th dan one wears a black belt, from 6th dan to 9th dan a red and white belt, and 10th dan and above a red belt, but aside from this they can also were a white belt.  This is the final determination of dan-ranks by Kanō. There is some disagreement as to whether this system was created in March 1926 or March 1930.  It is clear that the system thus does not specify the upper limit of the dan-rank system, nor does it say anywhere that these white belts would be any wider. Kanō himself virtually always wore a blackbelt belt while in jūdōgi. However, there do exist only a few very rare pictures, such as one of the summer schools where everyone is wearing a black belt, but where Kanō is wearing a white belt.  Kanō himself did not hold a dan-rank in jūdō; his title was the shihan of the school of Kôdôkan jûdô. Similarly, Ueshiba also did not hold a dan-rank in aikidô.  However, the system as created by Kanō was changed shortly after his death. I can't remember the exact date, but if I correctly recall it was between 1938-1940. At that point, the Kôdôkan formally determined that there would never be issued (and thus would not exist) any dan-ranks above 10. In other words, 10th dan became the highest (theoretically) obtainable jūdō rank. It also changed the colors for the red and white belt to no longer bridge 6th through 9th dan, but only 6th through 8th dan, and the red belt would not start at 10th dan but at 9th dan. Later these colors largely became ceremonial, likely because the 10th dan-holders promoted by Kanō himself do not seem to have worn any belts other than black. It is unclear if before Kotani, any 10th dan holder other than Mifune ever wore belts other than black.  Women would remain at a maximum of 5th dan until 1972 when the first joshi 6th dan-ranks were issued and the system changed. When women received the first 8th dan rank (Fukuda in 1995, and also Niboshi) the belt for them was red and not red and white. However, this was changed later when in order to meet legal requirements and eradicate differences that potentially could be seen as discriminatory and open the Kôdôkan up to legal problems. Hence, when Umezu in 2006 became the third female 8th dan holder, the belt now was red- and white exactly as in males, with the sole difference being the horizontal white stripe which is present on female belts.  Another difference in belt colors is that children starte out with a light blue belt, followed by white and brown. Those wearing a light blue belt were not called mudansha but hosshin-sha.  The above is how the system historically evolved within the Kôdôkan. Whether another jūdō organization will continue to adhere to the same requirements and limitations is an entirely different issue, since organizations have their own rules and could make whatever rule they want.  The stories about a specific dan rank for Kanō, such as a 12th dan and a broad white belt, is found generally in books written by Western authors without any reference, who never consulted any primary source and who just copied hearsay from each other. However, there appears to be one bizar precedent in a Japanese text, and if I recall the 1956 version of Illustrated Kodokan Judo contains a reference to precisely this issue. Since this text was published in various Western languages such as English and French, it is likely that it is the text that is responsbible for creating the impression of the existence of an 11th and 12th dan and of a broad white belt. What or who caused the inclusion of this suggestion in the 1956 textbook, I do not know, but it certainly was removed in the 1986 version.  The question was asked to the Kodokan and published in the translated version of Judo Kodokan of November 1963, issue 3, page 2573, where the question is asked ""Do the 11th and 12th Dan really exist"".  The answer is No, but it is added that they are theoretical gradens never awarded, and that the classical hierarchy stops at 10th Dan. However, as there is no limit to the level of knowledge that can be acquired by improvement, there is no limit to the grade that one can receive as reward. If someone reaches the stage above 10th Dan, there is no reason to refuse to give him 11th Dan. But the official reply ends by saying: ""But we are in the field of theory and the Kodokan at the moment does not envisage any nomination to these grades.""  It is difficult to convert these nuanced replies into a hard statement. In the end it is obvious that judo knowledge by far is not the only and perhaps not even the main criterion to be awarded 10th dan. It has been more than 60 years since the rank of 10th dan has been issued to anyone not residing at the Kodokan, which can be interpreted as one requirement being that one needs to be connected and employed by the Kodokan itself, no matter how advanced one's knowledge. In other words, there are still people in judo in Japan with very advanced knowledge, perhaps even more advanced than current Kodokan instructors, but they are never awarded the top ranks, clearly because they are not AT the Kodokan. They remain stuck at 8th dan at the most even though they may have held this rank for 25 years.   For the same reason I find it highly unlikely that the Kodokan would ever consider changing the upper limit to dan-ranks implemented after Kanô's death. Besides, one also needs to consider that the Kodokan in its 135 years history has issued the rank of 8th dan only 4 times to a non-Japanese, which gives a pretty realistic view of where the judo knowledge of Westerners is considered by the Japanese.""  ."

Uchi-komi and nage-komi are usually performed on an non-resisting opponent, most get a wake-up call during randori or shiai, myself included, once you actually have to make the kuzushi 'happen' without exposing yourself. It's magical once you get it right, but it just takes practice and study. Action-reaction mostly. Almost anyone can use strength to force someone weaker into a bad position, but this is not the best use of energy. Achieving the same result with little effort however is difficult. For your harai-goshi the hands need to work prior to your hip or feet moving in, but in practice kuzushi and tsukuri happen at the same time. Debana is the opportunity for attack, capatalize on that to provoke kuzushi onto your opponent which opens up for tsukuri. Practice action-reaction movements and the tsurikomi-action.

judo,3343bc,fleischlaberl,2,Sun Apr 19 11:24:49 2015 UTC,"As you do extensive research on judo - even if you don't see the details lack of practice and experience and so on - you know, ""principle"" is only one part of kata demonstration.  Look at the following demonstration of Koshiki no Kata:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7-IjzEK77g  You will see the difference in ""fluidity"", ""vivid"", ""realistic"", ""natural"" and so on quite quickly ...  As my english is poor and I would have to put too much energy in translating my thoughts from german to english some words of CK instead:  ""I am posting this clip to allow people interested in learning or studying Koshiki-no-kata to see that one indeed is supposed to actually throw in this kata rather than following the today more common mannerist copycat approach that makes no sense. Kata is still performed without the Kotani-introduced diagonal positions for movement 5 through, and the kata is at least alive not concerned with metric replication. Most important is that one learns how to appreciate the actual principles that underpin a throw when one actually throws; one learns to comprehend what is possible and what not and why. I encourage you to appreciate the positive things in the clip, rather than on the things that need improvement. That is really all I want to mention. For the rest it really is mastering the actual throwing that helps you consolidate grasping the basis of this kata. Inner calm, ki, and higher principles are to build on that, not the other way around. Enjoy !""  ."
judo,333aeg,H2Outbreak,9,Sun Apr 19 02:49:45 2015 UTC,Yes! Or grip right and learn left throws!
judo,333aeg,Category_theory,3,Sun Apr 19 03:17:21 2015 UTC,Give it a try. You can always change your mind later if you like.
judo,333aeg,Carlos13th,3,Sun Apr 19 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"Most people are right handed and will naturally expect a right handed throw. Knowing both left and right is a huge advantage.  Also, as Category_theory said, learn to left throws with a tight grip.  That will make things very unexpecting."
judo,333aeg,GrandMasterofFlowers,3,Sun Apr 19 07:38:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely yes! Left-handed fighters are much harder to deal with so you would have an advantage right there. If you 'feel' lefty already at white belt, there is absolutely no reason to go right. Train lefty, become a lefty. Develop grip strategies for kenka-yotsu, as this will be the situation you will find yourself in most of the time. I've switched from righty to lefty a year ago and I'm not looking back. The best is to be able to switch from lefty/righty at will."
judo,333aeg,Ryvai,3,Sun Apr 19 08:21:45 2015 UTC,Around fifty percent of world and Olympic judo champs are left handed or fight with a left handed stance.
judo,333aeg,realyfunky,3,Sun Apr 19 10:09:34 2015 UTC,"There is also a third possibility: to stand neutral with a double lapel grip and no leg advanced.  I do this from time to time. You can throw left and right without changing grips. But you have to have a very good stability and balance, if you want to try this (you are vulnarable to deep forward throws like seoi nage/otoshi).  As an example Angelo Parisi:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSuS8iOwXek  An advantage is also, that you controll both sides/shoulders of your partner/opponent and it doesn't matter, if he is left or right.  ."

judo,333aeg,manzobar,2,Sun Apr 19 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a little on the MMA boards, and the consensus seems to be that you should stick to the fighting stance that you learned first.  For example, if you started as a right-handed grappler (judo or wrestling) where you lead with power side (right), you should learn striking as a southpaw. If you started as a right-handed striker (karate/TKD, muy thai, boxing), you should learn to grapple as a lefty. There seems to be exceptions and switch fighters, but it makes sense to keep the same stance for all arts.   I have no intentions of doing MMA, but I spent years of my early teens greasing the neurological circuits to fight orthodox. As an over-the-hill judoka, it's a hard habit to break. Not sure if it's worth trying to break."
judo,333aeg,fintip,2,Sun Apr 19 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"I saw an excellent study that evaluated handedness of judoka. They found that at the amateur level, people were strongly one-hand dominant, but at the level of national and international competitors, throws were roughly 45/55% split between right and left handed for individual competitors--in other words, if you want to hang with the best, you have to be a threat from both sides.  The reason is that your combos are exponentially more threatening if you can shift to either direction. Your game goes from one dimensional to two dimensional.  At the amateur level, though, being a lefty will take you a long ways just on its own. It's just not what people are used to defending against."

judo,32ypun,cujo26,5,Fri Apr 17 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"In most judo clubs you shouldn't have any problems wearing a BJJ gi. Anyway, better ask at the place where you want to train, just to be sure. When you stay with Judo for longer though, a white gi would be better.  Varies widely. It depends on the focus of the group (competitors or not, and if what level, etc.). In the west it is typical to have either 90 or 120 minute sessions, which start with 30 min warm up. Other common exercises are breakfalls (ukemi), sparring on the ground (ne waza randori), standing sparring (tachi waza randori), technical instruction and drilling. The order, length, quality depends on the day, the dojo/club and the instructor(s). Don't be reckless. Practice breakfalls. A lot! Depends on where. In Japan you shouldn't just show up for training. Some dojos allow only invited visitors in. Everywhere else in the world: Never heard of just showing up being a problem. But it's better to call or write anyway, since you can make sure, the training session is not called off or something."

judo,32ypun,StabbyRobot,3,Fri Apr 17 23:16:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on your instructor, we train both on the same night so BJJ gi's are ok. I keep a nice judo gi for competition and train in it really only during competition prep since it is a bit heavier than my BJJ training gi's. Similar to jiu-jitsu, expect a technique or two. Sometimes a combination. Expect lots of drills and much less live sparring. Speaking from my perspective, expect a proper warm-up consisting of stretches, sit-ups and judo push-ups, ukemi (breakfall practice). Relax. In my third year of Judo and I haven't had any serious injuries. If something feels funny, take time off. If it really feels funny go see a doctor. Same as jiu-jitsu, just make sure you are getting proper rest and recovery. Call ahead. Because courtesy."

judo,32ypun,bigbaze2012,2,Sat Apr 18 07:50:51 2015 UTC,"As general advice I would like to give most people coming from another martial art/combat sport:   Be humble. Accept instructions and always attempt the techniques instead of assuming they're ineffective because they go against your instincts. Never start teaching unless the sensei tells you to. This includes while you're working on the ground, one-to-one, with another judoka. Every sensei I have worked will agree because it's disrespectful to the sensei. Mind you, this is a temporary etiquette until you've gained some respect within the club.   I know this isn't what you asked for but it's something I would like to tell anyone in your position."
judo,32ypun,dreamsindark,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:00:01 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! I appreciate any and all advice you can give me
judo,32ypun,dreamsindark,2,Fri Apr 17 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone!  So as I stated in my title, I'm coming from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to Judo (There are places to train both in my town and they conveniently alternate training days). I have a few questions to ask before I pitch up and make a fool of myself.   I have a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gi, but it's black, would it be disrespectful to wear it? Should I buy a white gi instead? What can I expect from a typical Judo lesson? Do you have any general tips for avoiding injury? Can I just rock up, or should I call ahead?   I believe that's all I have to ask for now. Thank you all in advance for reading and answering.  Edit: added a question   1) It will be acceptable in most places, but you will stick out like a sore thumb. You won't be allowed to compete in it. BJJ gis are cut slimmer, and they are a bit harder to grip. In randori they confer a tiny but distinct advantage.  2) warmup, ukemi, maybe some groundwork fights to get you started, then a bunch of technique drills (typically about 80% standing and 20% groundwork), and finally some stand up sparring.   3) lots and lots of ukemi. For the first few weeks you will feel like you were run over by a train after each class, and you'll get a bunch of small injuries every time you do randori (bruises, bent toes and fingers, etc.). Then your body gets used to it, and you'll feel fine. Be warned that being on the receiving end of some of the throws (like sode tsurikomigoshi or kata guruma) can be a bit terrifying at first.  4) Generally you just show up, but I suppose it varies from place to place."

judo,32ypun,altiuscitiusfortius,2,Sat Apr 18 07:54:47 2015 UTC,"I do both BJJ and judo   Its acceptable for a couple practices, but you should get yourself a judo gi. They are very different- BJJ gis are normally more fitted to the body and less easy to grab, where is Judo gis are less fitted with enough material to easily get a grip. Warm up, Drills (uchi-komi), maybe technical instruction, newaza (ground fighting) followed tachiwaza ( standup fighting) Wear knee and elbow pads in tachiwaza, if you're getting thrown, accept the fact that you've been caught, do you breakfall, get up and fight again. Also chose more experience partners- black & brown belts are good to work with, because they will have cleaner technique and less likely to hurt you-- but don't be an idiot, because they'll punish you for it. Just turn up, like BJJ clubs- Judo clubs love fresh meat :)"
judo,32ypun,goldboxG,2,Sat Apr 18 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is disrespectful. Get a white judo gi instead. Warmup, drills, technique, randori, technique, newaza, cool down. Train with blackbelts only if you can. If you feel someone is dangerous, avoid training with them. Try to keep your back straight, even if you see some people in competition that hunches over, it is not a good posture and not needed for judo. Just show up"
judo,32ypun,pk618,2,Sat Apr 18 04:43:21 2015 UTC,"It seems most the major points have been touched on here, but I'd like to highlight something. During randori, stand up straight. BJJ fighters have a habit of fighting much lower like a wrestle. This will make techniques hard for you to execute and you'll get tossed alot."

judo,32wd30,dave_attenburz,3,Fri Apr 17 18:02:45 2015 UTC,"So, on the one hand, I totally agree.  i like the idea of making your own tools and training equipment, especially if you aren't all thumbs.  On the other hand, if you are a professional dojo, it's best to look professional.  Electrical tape peels up, slides, and there's that residue.  Self made stuff is great if it's just you and a partner, but dozens of people moving across it, especially when it's not in use, isn't going to stand up.  Meanwhile, this is a specifically printed mat that looks professional, and is durable."

An object lesson in the power of hubris.   It's haunted him ever since and he has a real chip on his shoulder about judo owing him a living. He's a major player in the ijf pushing to make judo a spectator by changing the rules to make it exciting.   From fighting films player bio: ""But even greater disappointment was to follow at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Having stylishly thrown and arm locked his way into the final, he faced the unknown German, Frank Weineke. With the fight clearly under his control, he underestimated Weineke, and for the first and only time in a contest he was thrown for ippon, with a right Uchimata/left Ippon-seoi-nage combination. It was the lowest point in his career."""
judo,32vvo8,Zack53827,10,Fri Apr 17 03:33:06 2015 UTC,"Since it isn't clear as to which one you are, the first throw was a definite ippon, match should have been over.  If you are one of the fighters, relax. It is much easier to get a grip that you like when you aren't stiff and have bad posture. When you are stiff when you have a grip, your opponent can feel any change in balance or kuzushi that you have, therefore makes it nearly impossible to throw them unless you overpower them.  If you are the referee, not bad. But call the score first before looking at your judges. If they feel it is wrong, it is their job to correct it. But it is not their job to score the match themselves.   The one judge who was closest to the camera did a huge no-no. Once you lift your arm for a score, you do not change it. Even if you say yuko and the other says it was an obvious ippon, then still keep your arm down. The way it is scored, is that majority rules. In this case, 2 officials said waza-ari, the other initially said ippon. Even had his arm stayed for ippon, waza-ari would be the score called. If the other judge said yuko, so there would be yuko, waza-ari, ippon, then middle score wins.  Again, not sure who you are, so I tried to be critical of everybody"

judo,32vvo8,BootsLikeMafia,5,Fri Apr 17 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest calming down when you're going for grips. You seem to be flailing and jumping around quite a bit, which isn't a good habit to get in to. Try to remain calm, and work on getting your favourite grip. As soon as you get your favourite (or a workable) grip, go for a throw.  And yes, that counter he threw you with should have been ippon in my opinion.  Keep at it though!"
judo,32vvo8,BootsLikeMafia,2,Fri Apr 17 04:34:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I am generally super slow in training, so I figured I wanted to emphasize speed, not that much though ha."
judo,32vvo8,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Fri Apr 17 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"No, I totally get that, and we've all been there. Rather than be speedy and hyper in general, in the future try to save it for when you're setting up a combo or entering for a throw. Your gripping can be both quick and measured, but it shouldn't be reckless.   Keep competing and training though!"
judo,32vvo8,Billbobb2,4,Fri Apr 17 06:36:45 2015 UTC,"The first throw (which I'd classify as Ko Uchi Gaeshi) was ippon imho, though one could argue the control wasn't overly good.  Anyway, your posture isn't good, it's kind of ""afraid"". Physical postures have influence on your mindset (there's a TED talk about that somewhere). You should aquire a more upright and ""confident"" posture. It will improve your movement and your mindset as well.  Your Ko Uchi Gari attempt wasn't bad. The timing was good, but your stance and/or pushing direction was off (hard to tell from the vid), but your opponent found a gap to exploit.  Your opponent had BJJ experience (as if his gi wasn't a big hint) and probably more competition experience."

Oh, and you didn't panic and immediately tap when he got you in an arm bar. Overall I think you did well and it's a great learning experience against a much more experienced judo/BJJ opponent.

judo,32thlx,yogurtrider,4,Thu Apr 16 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"Cool. Glad to here you found a better place to train. The last one you described sounded like a scene from the original karate kid. Training partners should never aim to hurt each other. That's very true. But like most sports judo involves aggression, and I hope with time you embrace this. For example if you're used to randori where your opponent gives you a good grip without resisting, he's trying to help you get up to speed. This won't last, and the better you get, the better the opposition will be. That's not a bad thing. It's good to have training partners that are competitive and push you to be aggressive. Don't be afraid to tell someone they need to tone it down but also don't fear the natural drive behind all martial arts."
judo,32thlx,monkeycycling,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely respect and want the aggression. But I think technique should come before aggression. Once I should know better, a little more tough love is more than welcome.

judo,32thlx,Wilthuzada,2,Fri Apr 17 14:01:13 2015 UTC,What are you learning so far? Id like to know because I just started an i may be in the wrong club for me as well. Ive learned 20+ techniques in 3 days and i cant remember how to do 90% of them. Ive also taken some bad falls. Obviously my fault since im new...but id like to be brought along more slowly. What are they teaching you at this new club?
judo,32thlx,TransientSilence,4,Fri Apr 17 13:20:35 2015 UTC,As a teacher and judo student. You have no possible way to remember all those throws in that time. Re fucking diculous. If you remember 10% you are probably ahead of the curve for newbies. Find a favorite throw and learn it. Experiment with others but first find your throw everyone is different

judo,32wezl,anuncommon,3,Fri Apr 17 07:20:08 2015 UTC,"If your back went out from twisting motions it may just be your back was the weakest link or that other supporting muscles failed you first. The best solution in my experience is to strengthen the whole area, from shoulders to hips.  Once you feel on top of your PT stuff, add in some progressively heavier resistance training. Stuff like squats, deadlifts, and hip thrusts don't involve twisting, but do involve activating a lot of stabilizing muscles that you need to prevent lower back injuries. After a few months of these I predict your back will not bother you any more."
judo,32wezl,farkoman,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"It's odd though, I've been doing judo for years and never hurt it from a turning throw before. That said thanks for the tips, I should strengthen the whole area just in case. Any other at home workouts for activating those stabilizing muscles? I don't have access to a gym right now so it's mostly bodyweight stuff for me at the moment."
judo,32wezl,farkoman,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"That's a real challenge. Certainly people get strong on bodyweight exercises, though personally I feel like it takes a special personality to be able to commit to that form of training, which is really mentally very demanding. I guess color me skeptical. Nevertheless you can check out /r/bodyweightfitness to get an idea of what's involved.  On a similar tangent would be kettlebells. Again, personally, I don't think they substitute for barbells, but for rehab/mobility/work capacity applications they seem to be gaining a lot of steam. So much that I'm on the verge of buying one myself.../r/kettlebell has answered some of my questions and could answer yours as well."

Tried to pendulum my legs from outside in and just felt some light soreness. Didn't think much of it.  Next judo class I felt sharp pain during breakfalls. Did more kesa escapes. By the time I got home, I could barely lift a pot off the stove. Coughing and sneezing was extremely painful. Sleeping on one side was painful too. Took 4 weeks off until I couldn't feel it at all.  Few weeks later, I hurt it again practicing kesa. Pain wasn't as bad, and I didn't take any time off. The dull pain persisted for several weeks.   Few months later, a partner fell on top of me hard,and I felt it again. Pain lasted about two weeks.   It will get better, but it will always be sensitive to pressure."

He gave me a prescription to take for three weeks no matter what, and I'm to take it a fourth week if it still hasn't gotten better by then.   The difference is night and day.

While I felt like my bracket was pretty easy, the middleweight bracket actually had one Judoka who is on the Olympic roster--several guys who train with Hrbeck in San Antonio were there, with Nina Cutro-Kelly coaching them.

judo,32l3l8,dave_attenburz,3,Tue Apr 14 19:56:50 2015 UTC,It's hard in judo because most guys are good enough that they can stop you from getting that grip. However it's totally different in BJJ where most guys have very little standup training and if they do it's likely to be wrestling which isn't as strong in the clinch - particularly in gi.
judo,32l3l8,dpahs,2,Tue Apr 14 21:15:37 2015 UTC,That's why grip fighting is so important.  Try working kumi-kata more frequently and see if this doesn't improve your positioning.

judo,32l3l8,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Wed Apr 15 11:53:25 2015 UTC,"He's exaggerating his movements in this demo. Eye-witnesses of his demos said so. A lot of movements, that may be ""dangerous"" for tori under normal circumstances aren't, if the right conditions are given. If uke's weight rests on the ""wrong"" foot at the time you pull such a stunt, he cannot attack you. Same when his balance is already broken or he is forced to move to avoid exactly that. Hirano's judo is incredibly complex and many, many different things happen here at the same time. There are forces at work, that not only work in the horizontal plane, but also vertically (notice how he ""waves"" his partner up and down in many instances). His actions provoke counter reactions or trigger reflexes in uke which he exploits.   Tokio Hirano's judo is very hard to read, but let me assure you, he was very successful with it.    In 1952, Hirano went to teach Judo in Europe. Within six years, he had accumulated over 4,300 wins. In order to promote Judo, Hirano would fight all black belts in the city where he taught Judo. In November 1954, in Mannheim, Germany, Hirano scored all ippons in 34 minutes against 54 black belt opponents (1-3 dan).   More in this article: http://judoinfo.com/hirano.htm"

Very easy to beat All Japan[ese]  (in skiing not in Judo). Or a chess champion like Bobby Fischer playing in Arabia or Africa.  In the 50's there was only Jean de Herdt as an europian, who could stand the Japanese and even Daigo at his top level. He resisted Daigo for 22 minutes and the fight was declared a draw.  ""En 1951, alors qu'il est déjà sextuple champion de France, il devient champion d'Europe 3e dan. Il se voit alors proposer ainsi qu'aux neuf autres meilleurs judoka Français par la Fédération japonaise un combat avec leur champion Toshiro Daïgo (6e dan) en prévision de l'organisation des premiers championnat mondiaux (1956). Le combat a lieu au Vélodrome d'Hiver devant 17 000 spectateurs. Daïgo décide de combattre en conservant sa ceinture de 6e dan (rouge et blanche) ce qui interdit à ses adversaires moins gradé de le faire tomber, de Herdt résiste pendant 22 minutes aux assauts de son adversaire et le combat se termine sur un match nul historique"".

Another story, which Jean de Herdt is narrating, that after his fight against Daigo in front of 17.000 spectators, the japanese judo federation took influence that de Herdt could not participate in international competition as the 1. World Championship in Tokyo 1956 (Pariset and Courtine were the french participants)  ."

judo,32m83t,Spooky-Forest,6,Wed Apr 15 11:43:13 2015 UTC,"If your partner is playing dirty that is fine. If your partner is playing dangerous, or outside the rules, then screw him.  Some people play dirty judo (knuckles into the side of your jaw when you are trying to prevent their entry for a choke). It's a little mean, but that's technically fair. This is the guy you avoid when you don't want to do rough randori.  When you have a person try kani basami, that's a double whammy; it's an illegal move, and it is outside of the permitted techniques allowed. This is the dangerous person you want to avoid, and talk to your sensei about regularly.  This guy sounds dangerous, as kani basami is a banned technique for good reason."

For instance, I've seen him try to kani basami someone else during randori.  For instance, he arm-barred me last night.  You can't arm bar in Nanka under the brown belt level.  He's been yelled at by the sensei about this before.  Luckily, I escaped it quick enough (to something like kamishiho), and sat my sweaty/swampy ass on his face.  Slightly ... uh... gay, but I didn't want to be actually aggressive back to him.  Sensei yelled at him, and laughed at what I did.  Whenever him and I do randori he does something (cheap/dangerous) that sensei usually ends up yelling at him about.  I strive to not get yelled at by sensei and play by the rules, but I want some passive way of saying ""hey dude, don't play dirty.""  I would say that, but his understanding of english seems un-good."
judo,32m83t,flowgod,5,Tue Apr 14 23:46:37 2015 UTC,Tell him you're not going to do randori with him if he doesn't behave.  There's nothing unclear about that.

Either this person respects the reigi and the rules of Judo or find somewhere else to taint. It appears his attitude is not in line of the spirit of Judo. Sensei should be more strict with him and give an ultimatum."

judo,32m83t,Bluurgh,4,Wed Apr 15 07:39:03 2015 UTC,It seems he has an attitude problem that is the root of the problem. He needs to understand what Judo is all about to the fundamental level. The sensei should give him a lesson in reigi.
judo,32m83t,TransientSilence,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:08:28 2015 UTC,"It seems that he pulls the cheap shit with me because he's intent on winning, no matter what.  I'm usually pretty hard to throw (I like to work on shifting my weight around without being defensive because I'm gearing up to compete) so I think he starts pulling from a bag of shitty tricks because of that.  Someone should tell him that randori isn't about winning, it's about perfecting your technique... oh wait, sensei says that every time this guy is in class. :-/"
judo,32m83t,Bluurgh,2,Wed Apr 15 17:55:23 2015 UTC,Have you tried talking to him? For instance you could ask him if he has any idea how dangerous Kani basami can be if not done correctly and point out the reason that it is not allowed in competition. He honestly may not know what he is doing is wrong so try and educate him first. If this fails then just avoid training with him altogether.
judo,32m83t,davomyster,1 point,Wed Apr 15 09:16:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, but he didn't try to kani basami myself.  He tried that shit on someone else... who didn't talk to him about it, either.

He's been yelled at before for arm-barring, but it wasn't quite a ""do that again and you can't train here""-yelling.   If this fails then just avoid training with him altogether.

judo,32m83t,davomyster,3,Wed Apr 15 17:52:01 2015 UTC,my favorite is the guy that says 'lets go light and really work on some clean techniques'  Then straight away hits you with the heaviest throw he can and power drives you into the mat.

judo,32m786,tranypanda,3,Tue Apr 14 22:22:00 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's a no go. Pulling guard gives your opponent ipon. Unless you have the triangle are armbar locked in prior to hitting the mat I wouldnt go for it.
judo,32m786,flowgod,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:34:29 2015 UTC,I believe the juji would be legal because they were still connected to the ground. As soon as they fully lift off the ground they will call mate.
judo,32m786,MrReality173,2,Wed Apr 15 02:49:56 2015 UTC,"As soon as they fully lift off the ground they will call mate.   Not anymore. A recent rule change allows for continued shime/kansetsuwaza when lifted off the mat. If you still aren't making progress, they will call matte."
judo,32m786,judokalinker,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:11:23 2015 UTC,Not according to IJF's refereeing rules for 2014-2016. Could you link me to the documents?
judo,32m786,MrReality173,2,Wed Apr 15 04:39:33 2015 UTC,"When a contestant performs or attempts to perform Kansetsu-waza or Shime-waza from the standing position and the result is not sufficiently apparent.   From here, page 4.  'Sufficiently apparent' being the qualifier. Basically, if you have a submission going and they lift you up, it isn't an immediate matte. If there isn't really a submission going on, they will break it up, but if I have your are fully extended, and you lift me up, they will give me a chance to finish it.  This is how it has been explained to me from some national level refs."
judo,32m786,judokalinker,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:44:56 2015 UTC,This to me doesn't even sound like it relates to newaza at all. I'm reading the point directly above it.
judo,32m786,MrReality173,2,Wed Apr 15 05:24:52 2015 UTC,"He is right. It's no longer immediate matte when you are lifted off the ground, given that you have something 'going' for you submission-wise."

Flying armbars are legal in judo, as long as you don't extend the arm fully until they are on the ground. This was basically just jumping guard, which is pulling someone into newaza without a technique, which is illegal."
judo,32m786,judokalinker,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"This is correct. 'jumping guard' is defensive though, and will be penalized with shido unless you are offensive otherwise. Skillful entry to ne-waza is perfectly acceptable as long as there is some technique being attempted."
judo,32m786,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:58:53 2015 UTC,First part: A.k.a. false attack?
judo,32m786,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:00:11 2015 UTC,"If you pull guard with any offensive technique in mind, it's shido for defensiveness I think. If you lay down without even pulling guard it be  can intepreted as a false attack. If you jump down to pull guard and immediately attempt to sweep him, by e.g. grabbing his ankles and push backwards, it's considered skillful entry to ne-waza :)"
judo,32m786,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:06:11 2015 UTC,But you can't grab him by the ankles the way you describe.  That's hansokumake for sure.
judo,32m786,fintip,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:08:45 2015 UTC,"This is where the rules gets complex. If there is a clear stop in technique (e.g. no player can score with waza) and one or both judoka are by definition in ne-waza, then you can grab the legs. So to pull this off is not really worth it in my opinion, as it takes very good timing."
judo,32m786,Ryvai,2,Wed Apr 15 08:15:28 2015 UTC,My understanding is that one player on the ground cannot touch the legs of another standing player... Are you saying that's not the case?
judo,32m786,fintip,2,Thu Apr 16 10:18:58 2015 UTC,"Not always, no :) if there is a clear stop in waza (no player can score with waza), then both players are allowed to grab the legs. The most common example is a failed tomoe-nage attempt, at which point are you allowed to grab the legs? The moment uke has stopped the technique to the point where tori cannot score anymore with waza, nor uke to score with counter, then both players are allowed to grab the legs."
judo,32m786,Ryvai,3,Thu Apr 16 11:46:55 2015 UTC,"That sounds incredibly fuzzy for something that can be hansokumake... These kind of distinctions/gray areas make me so grossed out with the state of Judo. Kano's original Judo had no points, no weight classes, just throw or fail. How did we get to this? -_-"
judo,32m786,Hippocampus88,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:48:55 2015 UTC,"The sport aspect of Judo requires rules and weight-classes to be fair-play. Being an Olympic sport just places more strictness into that part, it's not more complicated than that. We are still part of the Judo as it was intended, that has not changed, what has changed is that our training sessions are based on those competition rules, so we are taught this 'limited' edition of Judo. So what most of us know as Judo is the regulated version. I don't have a problem with it personally, for me the only part which I am ambivalent about is the leg-grab rules. Much of the other competition stuff is reasonable."
judo,32m786,Hippocampus88,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:58:23 2015 UTC,I posted this LINK some time ago where at 2:12:52 you can see a choke in a similar situation.
judo,32ly5r,fastr1337,2,Tue Apr 14 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"I had a 3-5 year old class the last few years and it was hard to figure out how complex a game could get.  If YOU need a small break and maybe the kids as well, I liked to play the ""mouse game"". It's a simple game of catch, where kids won't run into each other and they learn a bit of respect and courtesy because of the NO THROWING rule included:  the kids sit down in pairs of two (thouse are their mouseholes) and two start standing up. One of them gets the cheese (which was a foam ball we had lying around) and because mice are afraid of EVERYTHING, the other mouse runs away. if the running mouse gets caught by being touched with the cheese, the cheese will be handed over (NOT thrown). As soon as the former catcher lets loose, the roles are changed. The running mouse can escape by sitting down in a mouse hole, and the mouse that sits on the opposite side of the same hole will get pushed out and will be handed the cheese.  Another game is a simple command game. Called Fire,Earth,Water,Lightning. You can really be creative with this one. I play it like this:  In a defined area (we have a 6x6 field of different colored tatami) the kids run around and you shout a command (e.g. earth). Then the kids have to follow the command. The slowest responder has to do 10 jumping jacks (yes, 3 year olds can do jumping jacks ;) ) AND may shout the next command (standing outside the field). I start with only 1 command for 3-4 times then add a second and so on. If one kid is a bit slower, I like to give the command when this kid is close to the right position anyway. And sometimes I ask the fastest one to give the next command so he doesn't feel left out. commands are:  Earth: Lying face down anywhere  Fire: Stand on the edge of the field  Water: standing in the middle of the field (2x2m)  Lightning: Squat down as you should in real lightning too!  (Special Bonus) Thunder: After lightning comes the thunder which is made by the kids with backwards breakfall  Another simple game of catch is petrification (in german it sounds catchier and easier :D) I play it again in the 6x6 area as I wanna stay away from walls. One is selected who will be ""it"" for the next few minutes. Whoever is caught, turns into stone in a position you show them beforehand which is convenient for the move you wanna drill. Everyone who is not caught can free the statues by doing the predefined exercise. With me it's either crawling through the legs (ONLY FROM THE FRONT! otherwise heads will collide) or throwing O-soto-gari (but only if they hold onto the arm, or else they will always just do the simple ""push over the leg""). It needs to be clear that whoever is currently in the act of freeing someone CANNOT be caught."
judo,32ly5r,Hippocampus88,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"One I helped with a while back was to practice side falls from squatting. If you have enough people, have them all stand in a tight circle, then squat down, each extend the same leg into the center, then tip one person over, and watch the domino effect as they perform ukemi. Certainly entertaining, and helps lighting the mood. Also, a good segue into what we call ""fish flops"", which are alternating side falls performed while on your back, kicking your feet up and together to lift up, then falling to one side, then the other."

judo,32ly5r,Gibbo151,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"A personal favourite of mine is bulldog on your knees, have two Areas either end of the mat area parrell to eachother and the kids on there knees must run to each are on the haijime command, and have one catcher but each person caught must join the catcher, but there's a twist. Once everyone's past the halfway point count down from 5 and anyone outside the area is on.   Another is everyone to for a circle, hold onto eachother sleeve grips and use any means necessary to get the others in the ground there's general two winners just to make it easy, and if they a big I'm balance in skill level then you hope into the circle and defend or attack to change up the winners.   I also recently discovered with kids aged 6-13 they really wana do cool stuff like walking on there hands, or kip ups, stuff like that. The best part you don't even need to do it, just get them doing the exercises and they'll discover it themselves. Like walking on your hands is straight forward get them gains a wall, upside down hands about 0.5-1ft away from the wall and to use alternating hands (after awhile) to touch they hips, it took my class about 3 months but they all think it's the coolest thing ever."

judo,32lssi,jayyftl,3,Tue Apr 14 20:35:27 2015 UTC,"Have you washed it in hot water several times?  It will shrink. Have you worn martial arts gi before?  I'm not sure that what you think is 'comically loose' is really loose for a judo gi.  Have you asked your sensei/coach or other experienced judoka if it really is as loose as you think?   Additionally, I'm almost the exact same weight/height as you are and I would probably wear a size 5 gi, looking at their size chart.  Since we are pretty thin for our height (compared to other judoka of the same height), the gi will be fairly loose, since they make them for people with bigger builds.  But the gi just folds over anyway and is only held closed with the belt, so there is a decent amount of leeway you can make up for.  The other option is to go down a size, but then the sleeves would probably be too short for competition."

Fighting films, adidas, Essimo but you'll be able to find a calculator somewhere.   I'd suggest a 180cm gi and wash it cold, you can shrink most gis but you can't unshrink them afterwards."
judo,32lssi,Billbobb2,2,Tue Apr 14 21:18:02 2015 UTC,Judo gis shrink a great deal by washing them in hot water and putting them in hot in the dryer. I just bought a 6 Adidas that I was swimming in.

judo,32jhp9,fleischlaberl,2,Tue Apr 14 13:44:13 2015 UTC,"That's why hate the belts. They bring up a lot of pointless politics and pecking order bullshit.  The Federation in my country has been criticized for allegedly handing out dan promotions to friends of the officials, or to people who paid for seminars. As in, you pay 400 dollars, attend a week-long clinic, and then you get promoted for shodan to nidan or whatever.  To me, grown people bickering over the color of their belts is one of the silliest things in martial arts."

judo,32jhp9,SVPPB,2,Tue Apr 14 17:53:03 2015 UTC,"However, my main concern is my respect for the assistant instructors decision to not be mistaken for lack of courage to not speak up for myself.    That makes no sense whatsoever. Are you worried the assistant instructor will think you are a push over? Do you care?  You are giving too much thought to the color of a strip of cloth.I'm sure neither your head instructor or his assistant really care about of your belt.  After all, it's not entirely unreasonable of your AI to ask you to wear white. You probably look sloppy as hell, and you are probably getting your ass kicked by beginners.   Maybe he thought someone would see you and it would reflect badly on him as an instructor (""So that guy is a green belt, huh? This place is a McDojo"")  Maybe he was worried you would be mismatched in randori, and get frustrated or embarrassed.  Maybe the dojo has a no armlocks below a certain level policy, and he was worried someone would get hurt and he'd get in trouble.  What I'm saying is, ultimately it's a non-issue. Just learn judo, enjoy yourself, and you'll be wearing a green belt in a few months."
judo,32jhp9,Spooky-Forest,5,Tue Apr 14 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"Figure out what you want to go with; pick a belt you want to work from, then talk to your head sensei about it.  Some reasons you might want to keep your green belt on:   To not have people tell you how to do moves like they would a white belt (since you just need to refresh yourself, it's different from learning from scratch) So you don't have to have other low rankers tell you how to do moves (may or may not happen depending on the people at your club)   Some reasons you might want to take a white belt:   To avoid having the target on your back that the lower ranking belts will see on you in randori. To avoid having other peoples expectations of you being foiled (whether its a teacher, classmate, or guest). Also in tandem with not feeling like you have to ""live up"" to being a green belt. This point is largely in your head. To not be ""stuck"" at a green belt for awhile. To experience the field from the point of view of a white belt again, since that's almost what you are (having taken such a long break after only a few years of training).   It doesn't really matter. It's just a coloured piece of cloth that you tie up above your ass. Your ability or progress is based on what you can do.  Don't over-think it, and just choose whatever you feel more comfortable with."

I'll let me technique and performance speak for itself and let my instructors promote me as they see fit. After all, the point of Judo is to learn, what better way to learn than to start at the bottom. I'll speak to my head instructor privately about starting from scratch, so that he doesn't mistake my decision for lack of courage to speak up for myself."

judo,32jhp9,SVPPB,2,Tue Apr 14 08:58:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd start again as a white belt.   The journey is half the fun, when I started judo I always thought how much it would mean to me to get a black belt. Then, when I did, I was elated for a little while but I'd put that much into it that it wasn't nearly as satisfying as the journey to get there.  Not only that, if I go on the mat with a white belt I throw people at probably 30% speed, if I go on with a green belt it would be nearer 60-70% speed. If your technique and conditioning is sloppy at the moment, I wouldn't want the higher belts to assume you're sharper than you currently are, or they'll go harder."
judo,32jhp9,jujiroll,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"As I posted before, I was in the exact same situation.  Just wear white, apply yourself, and in a few months you'll be wearing green again.  White belts are the guys everyone goes easy on, they keep getting corrected, and their technique is sloppy.  Green belts are expected to know the basics, handle themselves in randori, and have passable technical knowledge.  Just go to class, learn and drill a lot, and after a while it will become obvious that your skill level is above a white belt."

One of the golden rules of training is that if you are ever unsure of something you should ask for clarification. Just be careful that if you ever have a question about something you think might be sensitive, ask in private."
judo,32jhp9,JeamBim,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"I'm very surprised that you were told to go back to white belt, that's absurd. Judo will come back fast, just like riding a bicycle, no reason to send you back to white. The kyu grades are not (or shouldn't be) very strict anyways, in my opinion. There's a large variation in skill and ability within a single grade depending on whether the judoka is an active competitor or strictly recreational, and whether they're in their 20's or in their 50's, etc. If your sensei gave you a green belt, you're a green belt, I don't care how long you took off."

judo,32f5cn,BootsLikeMafia,6,Mon Apr 13 08:11:27 2015 UTC,That was my exact thought on first viewing as well. I think it's HTML5 video. The quality allows you to see the referee's gaze pierce through the soul of the fighter :p

judo,32f5cn,shimewaza_specialist,7,Mon Apr 13 14:00:12 2015 UTC,"i don't think there's a rule, but from what i have heard if you do it, then you get an earful from the ""more experienced"" referees about not looking dignified. this coming from guys who wouldn't know a proper newaza technique even if it was being applied to them!  what a load of horse shit. i was seriously considering becoming a ref after i am a shodan, but forget it if i will be subject to criticism for actually wanting to be able to observe the action and be a good referee."
judo,32f5cn,rjgreen85,2,Mon Apr 13 18:30:21 2015 UTC,i get shit for this all the time. you know what i think's dignified? kneeling down so i can see what the fuck's going on :)
judo,32f5cn,shimewaza_specialist,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"it's a serious issue.  judo in the US (and i suspect elsewhere) is being overtaken by BJJ, it's suffering at the grass roots level and there is a distinct lack of referees.  being a ref is a crappy job. everyone hates them, everyone second guesses them, and if you think it's annoying to deal with rule changes as a competitor, then imagine that it's even more so as a ref.  with all that going against them we need to encourage people to become referees. issues such as this, where someone (like me) who is passionate about judo, and who is willing to step up and deal with all the bullshit, is less likely to do so because my perception is that i would be prevented from doing a good job if not allowed to follow the action.  this sport is changing with the times, and like it or not, newaza is getting more attention in judo. senior referees who won't allow the sport to change to reflect the times are in my opinion killing judo."
judo,32f5cn,Suey13,-8,Thu Apr 16 02:11:15 2015 UTC,If you can't take criticism from someone with more experience than you have then maybe you need  to re-evaluate what judo really means before you get your shodan.
judo,32f5cn,shimewaza_specialist,7,Mon Apr 13 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"to be clear they were not criticizing me but rather a nidan at my dojo who was nice enough to volunteer to become a referee. this is a guy with a ton of judo experience as a competitor, up to the world masters level, who definitely has as much or more judo experience than the refs in question.  plus he wasn't being criticized for how he was making the calls, they were on him for going down on one knee to get a proper view of the action in newaza, you know, the kind of thing that keeps judo just a little bit safer for all of us, and these stuffed shirts for lack of a better term were telling him it was ""undignified"" for a referee to do that.  you know what's bad for judo? having someone get choked unconscious because you couldn't see them tapping from way up in your ivory tower, or having someone's shoulder torn up because you couldn't see properly to call matte in time.  so i'm so sorry that your panties get in a bunch when the referee has to actually do a good job and not look like a fucking statue there, but i think that the safety of the players and accuracy of the calls are more important."
judo,32f5cn,sfw84,2,Tue Apr 14 01:10:53 2015 UTC,that ref (his name escapes me right now) always looks like that. watch him go around the ring. he looks like he crapped his pants and is trying to power through the round. good ref though. just a weird stance.
judo,32f5cn,PhoneySoprano,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:19:26 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain what's going on here?
judo,32fw20,Judostu,13,Mon Apr 13 13:48:50 2015 UTC,"In randori, I tend to apply (mostly juji-gatame) quickly to the point of resistance and from there on only slowly further. some guys get out of it and afterwards brag that they didn't lose to me (as I'm THE ne-waza guy in our club), but who cares.  I got the feeling that this gives me a slight disadvantage in shiai, as I won't break arms instantly by training this way. But who cares, we're no professionals and got jobs/go to school besides Judo. So I can be a nice guy."
judo,32fw20,Hippocampus88,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"I apply my kansetsu waza all in a very similar fashion as the above has stated. To me, it gives me the ability to ensure control over my opponent, too. If they can get out, I didn't have the best control.  Chokes can be a bit different. As long as it's a blood choke, apply it as fast and strong as you can.  Ultimately I'm there to work WITH my teammates so there's no harm in letting them escape."
judo,32fw20,MrReality173,4,Fri Apr 17 05:42:42 2015 UTC,"I take it easy, it's randori.  If you are in the position where it is being applied on you, you've already made a mistake and should try to learn from that whether or not the lock is on immediately or is effective."
judo,32fw20,JoeDwarf,3,Mon Apr 13 14:03:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, in class I like to see how slow I can throw them on and maintain control. Let them feel it, see it, and make an attempt to get out. If I can hold and maintain a nice, slow control to finish through their escape attempt then I know everything is working as it should. If they aren't tapping (especially lower ranks) I will always let it go and transition. Hurting a partner doesn't help me get better. Lower ranks also get a tapping lecture and if that doesn't take they get push-ups until it does. Doling out punishments like that is not my style, but some lessons are very important.  This is true for me both in BJJ and judo, barring that I am not a BJJ instructor so telling others what to do is not my role. My BJJ teammates tend to have a similar attitude (they're good people), but do often go a little faster.  My biggest issues are with low ranks who have no idea how subs work and people who want to ""prove"" something by submitting the black belt. What was your partner's rank?"
judo,32fw20,wingingitman,2,Mon Apr 13 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"He was a four stipe white belt, so yeah one of those guys who is probably close to getting his blue and maybe has something to prove. That said he was a nice guy and i'm sure there was no malice intended. Still that doesn't help my left arm which still hurts two weeks on."
judo,32fw20,Ryvai,3,Mon Apr 13 14:59:04 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this is true for BJJ but they say there's nothing more dangerous than a white belt learning ashi-waza :D your shins will hurt for days!

judo,32fw20,wingingitman,2,Mon Apr 13 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yup, that experience range where they know enough to be dangerous, but not necessarily enough to be cautious.  Range of motion exercises are definitely reccomended if you aren't doing them already. I neglected those rehab-type activities on some early injuries and a few of my joints are still reminding me.  What are  you throwing on it for support? I have used something like this in the past. It helped a little."

judo,32fw20,Pedro_Hizzo,3,Mon Apr 13 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"Besides flexion and extension of the elbow, wrist work (flex, extend) is also important since a lot of muscles that originate at the elbow insert at the wrist. I also found some rotational stuff helpful, for example bending the elbow 90 degrees and  doing a windshield-wiper-like motion against a resistance band (good for shoulders too). Also pronating/supinating the hand with resistance band wrapped around the it is a good exercise.  If you google around you can probably find better descriptions and a larger variety of exercises, but here is a decent pdf with some brief descriptions and things you don't need resistance bands for if you don't have any around.  If it keeps bugging you, poking your head into an actual PT place might be worth it, but I've never bothered for minor elbow stuff."

judo,32fw20,Ryvai,2,Tue Apr 14 13:30:04 2015 UTC,"I go slow and keep applying pressure. But sometimes it happens. Sometimes your bodies are moving in ways that the arm bar happens quicker than the both of you would expect. It's happend to me a while back as a blue belt gong against a purple. Elbow popped before I could say ""tap"". On the other hand I've gotten arm bars in scrambles and my partner had to yell out ""tap"". There was no pop, but I'm sure it was pretty close as I heard the ergency in his voice.  So, it happens but we don't really slap on submissions full force %100. But we don't go really really slow all the time. So given that you tried an escape and he readjusted the arm bar sounds to me like it was just an accident.. I hope."
judo,32fw20,Brian175,2,Fri Apr 17 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"Slow and steady with joint locks for sure. No one wins randori, so it's not worth hurting people for the tap.  My wife has a permanently wonky elbow frome someone cranking a juji gatame. For chokes I go a bit faster but generally try to work my way to as technically perfect a choke as possible so the tap comes fast when the final application comes. People taking randori too seriously is a pet peeve of mine (and the reason I'm out of competition with an ACL injury)."
judo,32fw20,LactatingBadger,2,Sat Apr 18 12:52:23 2015 UTC,"How dare you bring up BJJ? this is blashemy! Just kidding. I never go 'full tilt' as you put it, especially not in randori. Randori was developed for this very purpose, to safely practice techniques without getting injured this way. If I can feel that I can control the arm to the point where he has no weapon to defend it I slowly ramp up the pressure so that I don't injure my opponent and uke is given the chance to experience his threshold for pain and the limit to his joints. If you are rolling to escape, this is particularly dangerous, only an asshole will go full retard on your arm during a roll, the forces are just too great. I even sometimes let go of the submission when I'm against lower belts if I see that this is going to be ippon for sure and let them try to escape it instead. I learned something and they will as well.  EDIT: By the way, I read your topic wrong the first time. I thought; how hard do I slap? you mean how hard I tap?  Hehe"
judo,32fw20,silvaphysh13,2,Mon Apr 13 14:01:18 2015 UTC,"It was meant to be ""How hard do you slap on a submission"" Anyway I felt slightly aggreived that this guy went full tilt straight away but then maybe that had somethign to do with the fact that he knew he was rolling with a Judo black belt and he wanted the scalp"
judo,32fw20,dermanus,2,Mon Apr 13 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"There's always someone who wants to prove a point. Being a black belt you probably get your fair share of flak. At least tell him to ease up on the submissions next time, he might hurt somebody badly being like that :)"
judo,32fw20,Anthony126517,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:50:42 2015 UTC,A lot of it is how hard you roll too. Two guys going 80-100% are going to crank on submissions harder. It's just the way it is.
judo,32fw20,onehungrybear,2,Mon Apr 13 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"I tend to go hard until I think its close to coming on and then apply pressure slowly. I think it is not so important how quickly you apply pressure, but that you increase pressure at a constant(ish!) rate so that your uke can feel when it is going to be too much and judge when to tap properly.  Edit: forgot the other half of your question!  No, I don't think it was your fault. Your partner should have been more careful. That being said, maybe you have to have something go before you fully appreciate just how important that is! My ligaments can attest to that!"
judo,32fw20,shatinahat,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"I personally see no reason to jam into a submission full speed in practice. The expression one of my training partners is fond of is ""Why break your toys when you can play nice and have them longer?"""
judo,32fw20,DysonMachine,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation. There are a couple guys at my club that I know like to go hard. Against them I'll go a bit faster, but I still slow down near the point of resistance. If I'm facing a lower belt or someone who doesn't move as well I'll go more gently.  For example one of our older black belts has major problems with his left shoulder, to the point where I only have to get in position for the juji gatame and he's ready to tap. I'd never slam it on in that situation since it could seriously hurt him."
judo,32fw20,DysonMachine,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"Well it depends in BJJ when I slap on a submission it's mostly vs higher belts blue (few stripes),Purple,etc. You can go faster with submission but at the same time be cafeful not to pop his arm. A whitebelt probably was just happy to tap a Judo blackbelt for the first time and maybe got carried away it happends lol. You can go as hard as you want tho"
judo,32fw20,jujiroll,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like to tap early most of the time. There are moments where I do let my pride get the better of me, and it puts me in dangerous situations, but I try to tap as soon as I feel that they got it. I have nothing to prove, but I have a lot to learn, so why risk missing practice?   On the flip-side, I never go 100%. I go really, really, slow when I think I have an arm bar - I've probably got my partners to tap on a juji a total of 10 times or less. Also - I get irritated by guys who go hard/fast enough to risk injury like that. I know they don't mean harm, but it seems unnecessary in plain randori."
judo,32fw20,jujiroll,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:36:32 2015 UTC,"Niiiiiiice and slow. If your technique is good, then it will take a lot of energy for them to get out. Then just keep wearing them down. Eventually, they will be too tired to try those hail mary escapes and tap."
judo,32fw20,jujiroll,0,Tue Apr 14 05:42:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's your fault.  Especially if you were wearing your black belt.  They resent that shit.  (I'm a shodan as well and I wear my white belt to BJJ)  It's because you were rolling out.  I would do the same.  If someone starts rolling out of a sub they shouldn't be rolling out of, they are going to get it."
judo,32fw20,jujiroll,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:09:17 2015 UTC,"I wasn't wearing my black belt as I am a BJJ beginner but the guy was aware of my Judo rank. I was rolling out of an attempt to armbar that hadn't worked. The Armbar was not on. I may not have explained myself very well in my original post. It was more like armbar attempt, fail. Then second armbar attempt put on full pelt giving me no time to tap before my elbow popped."

judo,32fhka,fleischlaberl,3,Mon Apr 13 11:10:44 2015 UTC,"Respect, conditioning, technique, understanding of the rules, a degree of aggression, tenacity to win. That's off the top of my head.  And a love for Judo, of course."
judo,32fhka,pk618,3,Mon Apr 13 12:14:20 2015 UTC,"All of the above and some more. A good fighter needs;   A rigid mental attitude: The nerves can get to some people. To perform under pressure and a lot of spectators and to become empowered by the the butterflies and nervousness can be the difference between winning or loosing. That is why pot is actually a performance-enhancing drug. It can help to calm their nerves to perform better in front of millions of spectators. Physique and conditioning: Your physique needs to be good. As stamina diminishes, so does concentration and focus, thus allowing you to make mistakes. Be trained to endure 10 min golden score fights. A good physique also allows for more techniques, otherwise not possible. Character: Having character on and off the mats gets you respect and will make people support you, support that you will need to succeed as the level of competition increase. Being a role-model to the ones around you is part of Judo; jita-kyoei. Having character can also help you attract more sponsors, which come in handy. Sponsors love Judoka with a huge fanbase. Determination: The saying; 'hard work beats talent, when talent doesn't work hard', is one of my favorites. One needs to be willing to work hard and keep at it, despite downfall. Fall down two times, rise up three times. Intelligence: The ability to fight 'smart' is important. Deploying clever game plans to defeat your opponent can be more effective than strength and technique combined. If the opponent is not allowed to do anything he is used to, forcing him into your realm of Judo can completely demolish an opponent otherwise superior. Mark Huizinga said in an interview that he was not particularly talented and not the best physically. Instead he worked hard and used clever tactics and unorthodox techniques that caught his opponents off-guard. Hard work beats talent. He has an IQ of 142, so it figures. Skill: Any of the above is useless if one does not know how to use the advantage given to you. The fundamental essence of Judo still applies. It's like having a huge toolbox with no tools in it. Having the best tools can sometimes get the work done better."

judo,32djbw,saatanansaatana,3,Sun Apr 12 22:08:20 2015 UTC,I've been training with a broken toe buddy strapped. At first I didn't do much while it was still sore but eased into training and using different techniques (no tai-otoshi). At the moment I have no pain and don't feel like it is giving me any problems during training and competition but it has been 8-9 weeks and it hasn't healed yet. My case is a little different because where the fracture is also where the bone has a cyst so essentially the bone is hollow. I've seen a specialist and was told to expect a longer healing time.  I have been warned that the risk with not allowing it to heal that a non-Union fracture could occur which is painful later on. I'm curious if anyone else has experience with healing times with toes?

I taped it up and continued two rounds of randori as it wasn't too painful at the time. Boy, after a few hours I could feel it.

judo,32djbw,baccaruda66,3,Mon Apr 13 07:08:11 2015 UTC,Pretty much anything that doesn't make it hurt MORE while it's healing is OK. Discuss it with your instructors and training partners. You may wish to omit randori in place of structured practice designed to avoid aggravating the injury. This is a great opportunity to work on form and/or katas.

However, even the thought of randori makes my toe hurt!"
judo,32djbw,Judostu,2,Sun Apr 12 22:57:48 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I'm not practicing for the time being as I'm too busy with school for another year and a half, but I remember a few big-toe injuries I had and what worked for me. I actually rolled my big toe under its own foot and injured the joint (both toes - not simultaneously!) .. I did take a couple of weeks off each time, and then chose lighter practice - assisting the kids or doing non-dominant side throws. You can probably trade throws with a partner as landing from any throw they choose shouldn't hurt your toe ;) ... good luck!"

judo,32djbw,shimewaza_specialist,2,Mon Apr 13 18:00:09 2015 UTC,I've had a few broken toes in my time. Some from playing football (Soccer to my American cousins) and more recently from Judo. My big toe on my left foot only bends one way but all the other toes still function. I always tapped them up and carried on training but this doesn't mean its the best thing to do.

The Toraki will cost you around £100 with postage etc as it come from Canada and Blitz no longer make the Shuurai lite so you are out of luck there.   If you want a decent gi then you are going to have to pay £70+ so my advice, if you are on a budget, is to be second hand from eBay. The benefit of buying second hand is that the gi will be pre shrunk so all you have to do is ask for the measurements before you buy and then you won't have to play the Washing/Shrinking game."

judo,329kfq,jasonleeobrien,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"As always when discussing injuries: go see a doctor (if it lasts more than some days or gets worse in any way!)  The inner ligament (not a tendon!) of the knee can be tricky. If it's just a torn inner ligament, it will heal in time (but no sportsy sports). BUT the inner ligament is connected to the inner meniscus, so there is a chance that this is also damaged and as you might know, a hurt meniscus is rather bad news. Also chance for bleeding inside the joint, so if there is swelling immediately go to an ER.  I hope it's nothing after all and a few days of rest for your knee will fix it."
judo,329kfq,Hippocampus88,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:09:03 2015 UTC,It feels better today thankfully. Yeah if it doesn't get better I'll definitely go get it checked out. Also no swelling from the beginning which is good  Thanks!
judo,329kfq,wingingitman,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"I would still recommend a visit to an ortho or a sports doc. The inner tendons of a knee are really poorly vascularized, you could still have an injury or a rupture with no swelling. They also have far more stretch receptors than actual pain fibers, so a true acl/mcl rupture isn't always painful (meniscus, on the other hand, has all kinds of pain fibers and any damage tends to be excruciating).  Might be jumping at shadows, but better safe than sorry. I trained on a compromised ACL for over 3 months and the lack of stability could have easily damaged the knee more (thankfully my coaches at the time were not shy about making me sit on the side, despite my objections). Probably the dumbest injury-related choice I have made in judo. Had surgery, got a new one bolted in, 6 months later back on the mat."

Some are frightend, others are overconfident, some are not focused, others are not open. Some have courage but not a lot of fight intelligence, others are vice versa.  Complete different coachings.  If someone is a slow starter cause of trying to be perfect or fearing to lose, I say to him/her, that his/her fight lasts only for one minute and that this fight is the only one for today so he/she has to decide the fight in one minute.

judo,328mjs,Ryvai,2,Sat Apr 11 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"If one doesn't have one or hasn't been able to turn it on, how do you develop it?   This is something I've pressed for in my club a lot: regularly scheduled mock shiai. With new judoka coming in, the biggest thing is that people don't get a chance to feel what a real tournament feels like, and actual tournaments go by so quickly that they don't get a chance to recognize their mental flaws.  Now, the important point to this isn't necessarily practicing competition judo, but instead familiarizing them with the feeling of competitions. In practice we joke around, get serious, rep, go between 10% and 90%, all standing or all ground. At no point is there a real chance for them to get familiar with the feel of tournament play enough to focus on it.   And as far as development, I have heard of taking on so e one with less skill, and using that to your advantage to build confidence.    In my opinion, this doesn't do anyone any favors. If I go wipe the mat with a white belt all the time, it doesn't help the white belt get better and it doesn't give you a chance to improve. What I try to do is a little of both at the same time. In groundwork for example, I'll go for something like a pin and give them a bit of extra leeway to try and get out, usually enough to see what it is they're going to do. If it's a sensical kind of move, I'll test myself by letting them advance. After our round is up (and sometimes in the middle of it), I'll debrief with whatever wisdom I can come up with. It gives me a chance to reflect on it for my benefit and coach them a little bit for their benefit."
judo,328mjs,SonicEuthanasia,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:44:49 2015 UTC,"Think about what I want, think about how hard I worked for it, go out there and get it. I have found that gets significantly harder the less I train and the fewer comps I go to. It is all mental for me, but someone giving me a few good shakes by the lapels never hurt.  The problem I ran into a lot in the early years, and again occasionally after not competing as often, was adrenaline dump. I would work myself up, step onto the mat and run the show for about 30 seconds, then be a worthless sack of jelly until I either got thrown or enough time passed (2-3 minutes for me). So there has to be a middle ground.  Some of the guys I coach need a pep-talk, some need their headphones and no one talking to them, some need to rattle off a handful of uchi komi. Everybody has their thing and going to compete is really the only way to find it."
judo,328mjs,wingingitman,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:31:40 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's all about your mindset.  That comes from within.  I have a bit of an aggressive ""don't back down"" mentality in most aspects of my life.  I try not to escalate, but I don't allow myself to be pushed back.  I've always visualized it like this:  Imagine there is a ring on the ground emanating from your feet, and it extends twice the radius of your reach.  Everything inside that ring belongs to you.  Your opponent isn't standing on the mat, they're standing on your fucking mat, and it's time for them to leave or risk becoming a permanent fixture of your goddamned motherfucking mat.  Would you let someone waltz into your house and boss you around?  Put their hands on you?  No way.  This is your house, and this idiot isn't invited.  This is pretty much the same philosophy I have all the time.  If someone is being aggressive, I stand still.  If they enter that ring, it's game on."

judo,3280rd,-eeski-,3,Sat Apr 11 14:03:20 2015 UTC,"BJJ culture is very informal. Some more sport-orientated BJJ clubs (the one I attend) do the gauntlet because getting a new colour belt is quite significant. We have a few rules though that other clubs might not do - don't hit the head or the groin region, ideally hit the back. Others (classical Gracie Jiu Jitsu) promote on the basis of a test. Keep in mind, not only do BJJ clubs do the gauntlet, but they also slap hands and fist bump.  You generally don't do that in Judo."

judo,3280rd,Hippocampus88,2,Sun Apr 12 22:21:48 2015 UTC,"We used to have a similar practice one or two times at our club for juvenile classes (about green/blue belt). It was pretty much competitors only at our dojo and I think it was because all of us very pretty lazy in this session. But the alley stood pretty tight, so the whipping wasn't very strong.  Another similar practice was a variant of the 'catch' game. the one who was 'it' had to hop on one leg and catch someone. If he used his second leg everyone was allowed to whip him on the back and if someone was caught, that one could be whipped (both until they reached their 'safeplace').  I personally didn't mind these things, as it didn't hurt that much. the second game was actually fun. When you're a bunch of 15 year olds such things can get some steam out of your systems. A bit like this card game we played in school where your hand got physically punished if you lost.  Now being over 10 years older, I don't like the thought that the belt is used for physical punishment (rope-skipping with it is at least training). The game I mentioned might not be in canon with the Judo principles, but I still think it can be fun if you know your kids are ok with a bit of rough play."

For brown it’s the same but you run the gauntlet twice Finally for black belt you have to remove your gi bottoms as well and run the gauntlet twice.  You also get whipped when it’s your birthday and if you forget your belt or have been disrespectful to the instructor and anyone not whipping the other person hard enough gets whipped.  I’ve never graded or forgotten my belt and coming from Judo I am always respectful to the instructor so can’t comment about how much it hurts.

But I had no preconceived notion as to what it would be like. I've seen many people come to the Kodokan expecting something else. What exactly they were expecting? I'm not sure, but it's not what they thought.  My only advice is to make sure your expectations meet reality."
judo,327gfa,reviling,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:41:35 2015 UTC,How did you afford to live there for 5 years? I know there are jobs out there but was the reason you lived in Tokyo because of the Kodokan or did you live in Tokyo and happen to go to the Kodokan?
judo,327gfa,reviling,6,Sat Apr 11 06:45:11 2015 UTC,"I chose to live in Tokyo mainly because I lived in small towns all my life and wanted a change.... so I went big. I happened to like Judo, so I made it a point to check out the Kodokan. It seemed nice, so I stuck around there. Slowly moved closer as time went on.  I taught English to get over there and have a visa that lasted more than 90 days.  My original plan was to live in Japan for a year to get away from everything that was me. Experience some new things, make new friends, have some fun, etc. I liked it so much I just stuck around. The only reason I stayed for 5 years was because I became complacent. Not that it was a bad thing. I kind of want to move back."

If you are there for tough randori, then I'd recommend tokai university, but as an orange belt that might be a bit too much. If you are there for technical improvement and discovery, then it will probably be an eye-opener for you. The Japanese  'know their shit' when it comes to Judo. I was thrown by a 86 year old to the point were I was horizontal in the air during randori at the Kodokan, that really opened my eyes to 'ju yoku go o seisu' (softness subdues hardness)."
judo,327gfa,death_of_field,1 point,Sat Apr 11 09:20:52 2015 UTC,"I think if you want to get the most out of the Kodokan, you'd have to train there for more than 3 weeks, otherwise it'll feel like the equivalent of a quick touristy experience.  It's pretty much the whole experience of immersing yourself in Japanese culture which will really add to the whole Kodokan experience.  Guaranteed -  you will get a whole lot more out of it.   Having said that, if all you have is 3 weeks, it'll help a lot if you are already fluent in Japanese and you plan your trip very well.  The Kodokan has a timetable for when you can and cannot train, and there will be lots of long hours when classes are not on.  IF your Japan trip is all about training, then I'd research surrounding Judo/grappling schools where you can train as a drop-in to fill up your downtime.    If you're planning to just relax and be a regular tourist during downtime, then plan, plan, plan.  Again, if you can speak Japanese it would be very helpful in connecting with the locals.    *edit - also, I can't recall exactly but I think if you were to live at the Kodokan it will be relatively costly.  Someone who lives in Tokyo should be able to advise you of what living/renting options you have which are more affordable and possibly giving you more time in Tokyo for your money."

I think it should not be ippon as it appears that he landed on his shoulder with the other side of the body slightly off the mat. The only argument for it being yuko would be that he was not controlled enough, since he was able to completely roll out of the situation afterwards. But yes, in my untrained eyes, definitely waza-ari. Try not to wait for referee to give score, don't look at him, punish your opponent for not defending himself after a throw, continue with ne-waza. Oh, and good job! nice sutemi-waza. Keep it up :)"

However once he went over, white followed your overrotation and the first thing that touched the ground was the back of his left shoulder. Essentially, he had successfuly spun himself in the air to avoid an ippon.  You still had control, and there was both force and speed, and when he landed it was largly on his left side with no elbow underneath him so I would call it a yuko"

When you consider the fact that their players grew up practising without sleeves or trousers their pick up/ hug in for hip throw/ disdain for ne waza game makes a lot of sense.  Two of their top guys competing at home recently: http://youtu.be/W77zCIjhfkc  Wrestling is essentially the national pastime so they have a huge pool of talent to pick a judo squad out of.   As for that technique, the principle is that you're lifting the guy with inner thigh contact so I'd call it uchi mata. It's also prevalent in mongolian judo, which is similarly based on an indigenous jacket wrestling style."

judo,3257xt,Hippocampus88,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"also, 'khabarelli' usually is thrown to toris outer side and thus classified by IJF as obi-tori-gaeshi (sutemi-waza). The linked throw is direction-wise more similar to hip throws."
judo,3257xt,Ryvai,2,Sat Apr 11 08:17:59 2015 UTC,"This particular throw was discussed in a post earlier not too long ago. There exist no category that it fits into per say. It's more of a chaotic throw in terms of principle. One can view it as a form of ura-nage where the leg is helping with the lift, but then again, it's a somewhat different principle. A Judo scholar called sacripanti has called this form 'ushiro-uchi-mata' if I am not mistaken, as it comes closest to describing what is actually happening. Uke is lifted using the thigh to the inside of uke's thigh, only in a face-to-face orientation. Once uke is in the air, he is turned and flipped over. When it comes to Kodokan terminology I am at a blank with this, but my guess is that it is closer to uchimata than to ura-nage. It uses several principles, blended into one."
judo,3257xt,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Fri Apr 10 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"I watched this like 5 times now... I think you are right, it's an Uchi Mata, where tori clings frontally to uke and enters with his leg at an odd angle.  It's not a Khabarelli."

Kami-shiho and tate-shiho  appears to be similar but actually follows different principles. 'shiho' just refers to 4 sides, as in 4 corners of stability, or something along those lines. In tate-shiho you sit on top of your opponent along the longitudinal or the vertical axis, whether you hold here or there doesn't make a difference to the principle. However in kami-shiho ('kami' meaning something along the lines of upper or top-side) tori holds uke from the head-side, if it is symmetrical (holding under both arms or over both arms), it is stable and regarded as kami-shiho-gatame. If one differs from this, e.g. holding asymmetrical hands, one under and one over, or otherwise, it becomes kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame, because the stable symmetrical position breaks apart and one has adjust the grip to hold on to uke. In kami-shiho it is the hands and chest which holds uke and tori together, but in tate-shiho your are sitting on-top. The position of your hands doesn't change the principle of tate-shiho, that is why there is no 'kuzure' in that situation :)"

I don't doubt the skill or knowledge of the master. Mifune was known for having plenty of names that does not conform to the traditional waza curriculum. Perhaps he felt the need for an expanded classification system, who knows. The fact of the matter is; Kodokan has taken a stance on what they consider principles and we should follow them. They've even made an remark on their web-page on classification of waza, stating that;    ""Kesa"" and ""Kami-shiho"" are the only wazas which has ""Kuzure"".

If someone else has a better idea that contradicts the kodokan then let's go with that instead. I don't see any benefit in slavishly following an organisation just because it happened to be the first judo club."
judo,323vf3,Toptomcat,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:17:36 2015 UTC,If it had not been for the Kodokan attempts and wishes to keep Judo pure you would be fighting in red and blue gi's right now.   Oh god forbid. As if that would have been worse than anything happening to judo in the past 10 years.
judo,325szh,zjxyovf,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"this kind of injury usually heal without surgery. your doctor might've been an ass, but gave you solid advice. tape the fingers together and try to go easy on it with training. Ligaments will grow together in time, but the more movement they have during healing, the longer it will take. This is why it's impossible to tell you how much it longer it will be. If you still have major problems after 2 months you should see a sports doctor or a surgeon about it."
judo,325szh,Hippocampus88,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:07:53 2015 UTC,"Do you think i'm taking a risk if i train? Should i compete next week?   solid advice anyways, thanks"
judo,325szh,Ryvai,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:30:34 2015 UTC,"Joint pains and ligament damage is pretty common in judo it seems. Most high-level athletes tape many fingers and joints, but they are still able to compete. If you feel comfortable with the buddy-taping the fingers then go for it, but ultimately you need to evaluate the risks. I've done randori with a broken toe and finished a tournament with dislocated pinky finger, they survived and are fine now. If the injury had been more severe, say knee's/neck/back etc. I would strongly advice you not to, but fingers are usually not a big problem, unless you are a piano player, in which case I would advice you to let it fully heal."
judo,325szh,Hippocampus88,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"If the competition is something important for you then do it, you won't lose your finger from it (except someone bites it off). If you feel like it's more important that your finger will be ok in 1 rather than 3 months, skip the competition and grip training (including heavy randori).  Ligaments are pretty forgiving when it comes to healing, but take long as it is not living tissue like muscles."

judo,323c58,SVPPB,2,Fri Apr 10 11:17:09 2015 UTC,"'Nidan' just means two-step or two-stage 'something'. In the case of nidan-kosoto-gari you reap one leg then continue to the other (far leg), but using the same reaping leg, in a two-stage sequence. In this case he initiates with osoto-gari (tori's right leg) before finishing off with kosoto-gari on the far leg (tori's left leg). If one follows the incorrect notion that reaping the opposite leg is 'nidan' then osoto-guruma would become nidan-osoto-gari, which it is not. Here is a great example of  nidan-kosoto-gari :)"

Many of those people think your belt shouldn't be washed because it rinses away your magical ki power.  Your belt says ""Ki"" quite prominently. While I know it is a brand name, I was using the name similarity to make a jab at the aforementioned stupid belief.  (no digg on you, congrats on the promotion)"

judo,31zdk8,Ryvai,3,Thu Apr 9 10:04:52 2015 UTC,"Tough call... one could claim they had already entered ne waza before he turned his opponent over.   Looking at it from a traditional/martial arts point of view, this decides nothing.  By the rules, if we count this as a throw, since it was neither forceful nor well controlled it shouldn't get more than yuko imho."
judo,31zdk8,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Thu Apr 9 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"Well, he got a score and won the fight and the referees are very competent, even with the care-system taking a second look. What I'm asking is what is your opinion, should these kind of things score a point? I'm ambivalent. It's certainly not pretty, and looks very awkward. Definitely nothing more than yuko :p"
judo,31zdk8,Hippocampus88,1 point,Thu Apr 9 10:55:01 2015 UTC,"If you ask opinion, I would say no. because if you think further, if THIS scores, why won't it score after you have been thrown?  Imagine the exact same situation as in the video, but white landed on his side first. This would mean definitely yuko for blue, BUT wouldn't have changed anything for the ""throw"" white scored with.  Or, White attacks with something like O-uchi-gari, blue can't stay on his feet, rolls onto his back while hooking his leg in for sumi/hikkomi-gaeshi. By that logic waza-ari for both (if the sutemi-waza scored accordingly). (This situation happened to Marc Odenthal in Tbilisi GP, HERE is the clip to it)"
judo,31zdk8,Hippocampus88,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:20:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely not easy judging those scrambles. In the video you providing blue got the score because white lost control and blue took over the technique, probably for yuko :)"
judo,31zdk8,Suey13,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:45:49 2015 UTC,I'm probably biased because I was in a team with Marc some years ago. But the taking over of the technique is really arguable for me as it could be a poor attempt after having lost control.
judo,31zdk8,tomk11,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:19:08 2015 UTC,"After the o-uchi-gari attempt by white, blue had the ability to plant his foot and turn white onto his back.  If white was truly in control would he have landed on his back?  Or did blue use white's momentum and kuzushi to take control?  I believe the latter."
judo,31zdk8,Suey13,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:31:33 2015 UTC,I have too say I would definitely have awarded that to white. To me it looks like blue doesn't have much real control. But maybe a more trained eye sees something there that I don't.
judo,31zdk8,flowgod,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:35:23 2015 UTC,"As they were both still attempting to throw it can not be considered ne waza.  For it to be considered ne waza at least one players has to have attempted some form of ne waza technique, which is why if someone were to attempt a drop seoi-nage and drop down almost completely into a turtle position while attempting to drive their opponent over, the uke could side-step and ashi-waza the tori onto their back and have it still count as a throw."

judo,31zdk8,JoeDwarf,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:34:10 2015 UTC,yes because it was one ongoing  action with no interruptions that began while standing. not worth ippon but at least koka  haha ( or yuko) :P

judo,31zdk8,JoeDwarf,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:54:11 2015 UTC,I think yuko is OK but the scorecard said 10???  No way was that ippon even by the old standard.
judo,31zdk8,Suey13,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:35:29 2015 UTC,10 is wazari.  100 is ippon.

judo,31zdk8,Suey13,2,Thu Apr 9 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"A standard scoreboard uses three columns.  1 1 1 with the left being the ippon column, wazari middle, and yuko right.  It is meant to help individuals not familiar with judo understand the score because if your number is higher than the other player, you are winning. 0 1 1 beats 0 0 1, and so forth."

judo,31zdk8,JoeDwarf,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:31:35 2015 UTC,"Wazari.  The referee let the action continue as both players were attempting to attack (or counter-attack).  Finishes with a rolling action throw, which usually ends in a wazari score."
judo,31zdk8,wingingitman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the current rules is that only initial impact is scored and we're finally trying to kill the gross, slow rolling ippons.  What would sell me on a yuko would be another angle so I could look at blue's transition off his knee to his back. If he truly got ""thrown"" off the knee plant, the angle of impact after that would help me score it, but we have what may be the least helpful angle that could be provided. For all I know he did land at an angle sufficient for a waza-ari, but I'm not convinced. I am a pretty stingy ref though. It was golden score anyway, so a yuko would have done it."
judo,31zv3p,fleischlaberl,8,Thu Apr 9 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"The problem is; if you training Judo for 2 hours, how much of that is actually Judo-training? Do you count warm-up, games and listening to the sensei speaking. It's hard to determine how much effective training one gets. 10 years of Judo says nothing, it's how that time is spent, which leads me to one of my favorite quotes;   There's a difference between 10 years of experience and 1 year of experience repeated 10 times.   I think it's impossible to mathematically predict the moment you master something. It just takes years, how much effect those years have had on your progress is up to a whole bunch of variables :)"
judo,31zv3p,Ryvai,2,Thu Apr 9 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Also, I think that saying is usually applied to jobs, in which you work 40 or 50 hours a week.   Outside of elite athletes, I don't think many people train more than 8 hours a week of judo. And even at that rate, it would take over 20 years to become a ""master"".  Edited to add: Teddy Riner started judo 11 years ago, at age 15.  Unless he spent all this time steadily putting in 20 hours of weekly judo training, he still hasn't reached the level of ""Mastery"". Bear in mind that even elite full-time judoka usually only devote about 10 to 15 weekly hours to judo practice. The rest of the week they do cardio, weights, and cross training."
judo,31zv3p,SVPPB,2,Thu Apr 9 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"My point exactly, which leads me to believe that the 10k hours claim is not valid. If it counts the hours you spend watching Judo on YouTube, reading articles, reading about terminology, then perhaps yes. But 10k hours of pure Judo training is an extremely high amount. Oh and the the quote;    There's a difference between 10 years of experience and 1 year of experience repeated 10 times.   .. Translates perfectly to Judo! My point is, if someone tells you on the tatami that they have 10 years of Judo experience, how much do they actually know about Judo? If you have 5 tokui-waza, that you have been practicing for 10 years and only know a dozen other techniques, you have basically taken 1 year of learning the techniques and repeated them for 9 more years to improve them. But do you really have '10 years of broad experience?' I think it's useless to say how many years you have done Judo, because one must ask themselves; how many hours on the mat is 1 year? I've met Judoka with 40 years of experience who still can't tai-otoshi properly, who can't tell the difference between soto-makikomi and o-soto-makikomi, who can't break balance without using muscle. But then again I've encountered those who have had 5 years of Judo who just 'get it' and do things with their body I didn't know was possible. Judo mastery and knowledge does not come from how many years you've spent 'doing' Judo, but it's the quality you've achieved. I'm pretty sure that 1 year of training with the likes of Hiroshi Katanishi, Tokio Hirano, or at Tokai, etc. is worth more than 5 years of training at the average dojo, if not more. But then again, that is just my opinion :)"
judo,31zv3p,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:57:58 2015 UTC,Less chat - more splat ;-)  You have - as a blue belt - 1000 hours on tatami? (4 years with 4 to 6 hours estimated)  How many hours do you think you have in research?  .
judo,31zv3p,Ryvai,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, I've never really contemplated that :)  A sensei was asked once; When do you train Judo? 24 hours a day, he answered."

If you go to 4th dan (which is the first dan as a sensei = teacher) you need about 11 years = 10.000 hours.  So 10.000 hours isn't that bad as an approximation for ""mastery"".  ."
judo,31zv3p,SVPPB,2,Fri Apr 10 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"The 10,000 hour thing is a myth. Studies have been done on olympic athletes and about the highest average number of hours an athlete puts in by the time they're at the Olympics is 6,000. With that said, it's still a ton, don't get me wrong.  I practice Judo 9 hours a week (2 hours each Mon/Wed/Fri and 3 hours on Sat) and teach for 2 more to kids.

judo,31xd2k,OceanRacoon,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:09:45 2015 UTC,"I get the headache problem every now and again, sometimes from not realising I'm not actually tucking my chin.   Breathing out as you land seemed to help me a bit, and of course staying very hydrated.   But also it could be that your neck isn't that strong, which I think is a contributing factor in my headaches, because there's times when I know for a fact I didn't bang my head but landing hard sends a shock up into my brain.  Definitely start doing neck/wrestler bridges, get a neck weight brace and another exercise to do is to put light weights into a towel, lie down and rest the towelweights on your head and do neck ups, I'm going to call them, by lifting your head towards the ceiling. Be careful not to use too heavy a weight or jerk your head about violently, light weights and controlled until you get used to the movement.  You can do them looking at the ceiling to target the front of your neck and lie on your sides and put the towelweight on the sides of your head to target the sides of your neck.  A strong neck is super important in judo, so check it out."
judo,31xd2k,Merciless1,3,Thu Apr 9 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly the headaches make me think you aren't hydrated enough. Make sure you don't just show up hydrated, but also sip water during, and after a class. You may also need a sports drink to replenish electrolytes, and take in lots of fresh fruit. You should really strive to make hydration a normal part of each and every-day, it will make a huge difference on your overall energy levels. In addition to just drinking more, try drinking four ounces of water, every fifteen minutes, during your next judo session (or regular workout, etc.) this will help combat water loss through sweat.  How many falls do you take in a night, on average?"
judo,31xd2k,ARoyaleWithCheese,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:27:25 2015 UTC,I was thinking hydration might be the cause too but as sore as I am after a class it just feels a little too punishing. I take quite a few falls each night. We went back to back on morote seoi nage for probably an hour.

judo,31uq7e,Geschichtenerzaehler,4,Wed Apr 8 08:35:15 2015 UTC,"how do I develop ""spirit"". I seem to lack something in tachi-waza randori.

Although he's considerably shorter and smaller then me, in hindsight his presence when we go at it ""feels"" way bigger."
judo,31uq7e,Ryvai,2,Thu Apr 9 04:48:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm... it's difficult to tell where this problem stems from.   Are you comfortable with falling? If not, practice ukemi more. Once you are not afraid of falling anymore, you can attack more freely in randori. You'll still be countered often, but you won't be afraid of it and after a while your attacks will get sharper and harder to counter.  Do you have difficulties to switch the mental fightmode on? Judoists use various tricks to get into fight mode, like slapping thier own face, having someone violently yank their gi, etc...  Maybe you are just too tense? Relax. Try to be the dead calm eye of the storm. Make the (controlled) chaos happen around you, not inside you."

When your attacks comes natural as a result of reflex of being in a position, that is when the magic happens. Feel more, think less. This is almost impossible to do at a white belt level of course, it will happen with time. Keep at it in training and try to feel when there is an opening for an attack and let it happen instead of trying to force a 'perfect' situation. Once you realize it is there it is often too late. Your sensei is correct in that if you wait for too long you give your opponent the opportunity to attack before you, but this is not an easy thing to do because of the things I've already mentioned. Don't worry, you will be attacking in no-time as long as you stay on that tatami and absorb as much experience as you can :)"
judo,31uq7e,ninjasaywhat,3,Thu Apr 9 08:40:15 2015 UTC,any tips for closing distance without losing balance?  I'm always too far when going in for the throw and it's kind of a reflex/habit i want to break. some people told me that I lack kuzushi but it isnt an easy concept to understand/learn.
judo,31uq7e,mobius_striping_inc,3,Wed Apr 8 22:11:59 2015 UTC,"Practice tai sabaki, half and full body turns.  Refine your technique while practicing Uchi Komi (throw entries without throwing). Go slower than usual, until you got the distance right, usually placing your first step 30-40cm in front of uke's feet should do the trick (where exactly depends on the throw). Make sure you break your partners balance every time you do an Uchi Komi. The trick is not to pull super strong while you turn, but maintaining a subtle tension to keep them just a little unstable until you are in throwing position. What you actually do depends a lot on the specific technique though.  There are various ways of breaking uke's balance, some of them can be combined with each other.   Imagine a line connecting uke's feet. If you push or pull in a 90° angle to it, he has to take a step. Use this to make him move or block his movement into that direction somehow and throw him. Exaggerate uke's movements. If he moves somewhere, push or pull him further into that direction to make him lose his balance. Or do the opposite, break his movements. If he moves somewhere, hinder either his upper body to follow his feet or hinder his feet to follor his upper body. Either way, he'll lose his balance. Use Hando no Kuzushi: Destabilization by reaction. Push or pull uke into some direction, forward, backwards, up, down, sideways, around you. If he reacts with resistance, redirect your push or pull into the opposite direction, to add your force to his. Use this principle often. Use the third dimension. By lowering your own hips in the right moment and into the right direction you can increase the power of your own pushing and pulling actions. Use the third dimension, part 2: If Uke is bent down and rises up, he'll become unstable to the front, since his weight shifts towards his toes when he straightens his upper body. Combine this with principle 4. Pull him down and wait for him to rise. Then pull him up and forward. Torque: When you push or pull uke, adding torque to their body will make it a lot more difficult for them to resist said pull or push. Circles are your friends. Move around in cricles and make uke move in circles. If you control the circular movements of yourself and uke well, you can make him take bad steps or stances. Use this to your advantage. Combinations: Use techniques like Ko Uchi Gari, De Ashi Harai, Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi and O Uchi Gari a lot to either throw an uncareful uke or at least to drive uke's feet where you want them."

The worst part is that I feel like I've plateaued and haven't improved in weeks.   In other words, my judo ain't pretty.  Is this normal? And if so, how the heck do I get to the next level?"
judo,31uq7e,Ryvai,3,Wed Apr 8 10:22:02 2015 UTC,"Happens to everyone now and then.   Keep going. Try to review your technique, ask your coach or other advanced players for input. Drill the refinements.   Typical problems people run into are:   Wrong turning distance. Many try to get too close to uke too early and block their own movement. Too much telegraphing. If you are too stiff or your attempts too direct and obvious, your oppoenent can easily avoid them. Bad posture or footwork. Try to remain upright, don't take big steps, let your feet lightly slide across the mats. Practice tai sabaki (half and full body turns, with and without lowering your hips)."
judo,31uq7e,Ryvai,2,Wed Apr 8 10:40:03 2015 UTC,"Your judo becomes pretty when it's fluid and natural. This can take months, years or even decades. Some just 'get it' right away and some use a lifetime to discover it. I firmly believe that in order to understand judo one must start with the basics. After I started studying the fundamentals, things like movement and legwork, I made sooo many discoveries and flaws in my game. I probably have decades left of discovery before I can say I 'get it' and it all comes natural, but at least I've improved. I recommend you keep training hard, but do so with the mindset of curiosity and discovery, not a quick fix. Look at tai-sabaki and how to actually create unbalance. Feel, don't think."

judo,31uq7e,TS1307,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:13:48 2015 UTC,Something a brown belt told me yesterday. -When you get used to doing throws at arm length in drills it really works against you in randori because the opponent has so much time to stop you. You need to find a range that works for you.  Maybe try getting in their face a little more.

Anticipate the walk.  Take advantage of the natural kuzushi they have just by stepping one way or the other.  If someone is circling around me, I usually go in the direction they are with a taiotoshi.  If someone's pulling me into them for a backward throw, I like to step in hard and go for osoto gari, sometimes a really deep kosoto gari/gake.  Try not to work on the throws, but try to work on your timing.  Also, make sure to practice in randori the throws you're bad at."

This can be found in ""Judo - Formal Techniques"" by Otaki and Draeger for example.  More generally spoken, in a sacrifice throw we don't just want to sit or lie down and get uke somehow to follow us. Instead we have to take him with us when we go down. Otherwise our ""sacrifice"" would have been pointless.  Here are some examples with Tokio Hirano. As he goes down, he shifts his weight into the direction he wants to throw in by outstretching his leg:  Tani Otoshi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B166K9X-wDA  Yoko Otoshi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB1S18NL46M  Uki Waza (last one is different): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-w0CHH2PJA  In most of these samples there is little or even no leg contact at all."

judo,31uq7e,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:51:26 2015 UTC,Having a hard time closing the distance for any throw that needs me to turn my back any tips? I get foot sweeps sometimes in BJJ & Judo. I have decent defense training in both (Gi & No-Gi) however the throws are tricky. Oh I'm a lefty. Tips are welcome
judo,31uq7e,TS1307,4,Wed Apr 8 10:15:07 2015 UTC,"Don't try to cover too much distance when you turn in for a throw. Many get too close too early (with the first step) and block themselves.  Also try to get into position more quickly try to jump/slide with both feet into position simultanously. Work on the preparatory movements. Setup your throwing attempts properly. Small foot sweeps are excellent openers: if they don't hit, they get your opponent moving at least. Don't try to pull and stem strongly while you turn, this doesn't work. Merely maintain a certain control to keep them on their toes. Pull them into you once you've fully turned."
judo,31uq7e,Ryvai,2,Wed Apr 8 10:46:03 2015 UTC,"If you are a lefty and fighting against a righty his powerhand (lapel-hand) is probably blocking you. You need to grab his lapel on the inside of his arm to enter more easily. I'd also work on some difference angles. Try to attack in the open base between you by moving him left or right to create an opening and attack 90 degree to your left/right, not turning around all way 180 degrees :)"
judo,31uq7e,TS1307,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:20:45 2015 UTC,"Just curious but if judo is based around the premise of having a smaller opponent take on a larger opponent, why are there weight classes?"
judo,31uq7e,iushiush,5,Wed Apr 8 21:27:32 2015 UTC,"Because it is still a sport. And even if it is designed to be able to use against bigger opponents, the bigger opponents also know Judo, and being bigger, taller and stronger definitely is an advantage. That being said, there are some open weight classes in some tournaments."
judo,31uq7e,iushiush,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:31:26 2015 UTC,Open weight classes would be pretty cool but I see what you're saying about experience. If they expect to be thrown and know what they're doing it makes it much harder to throw them. Do you think height is really an advantage though? They're going to have a higher centre of gravity which seems like a disadvantage to me. Plus they have to get lower for throws.
judo,31uq7e,iushiush,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"There are techniques for everyone in Judo. Taller fighters usually have longer legs and arms. Their reach enables them to use leg/foot throws (Ashi Waza) very well. Tall judoka should be successful with Uchi Mata, Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi and O Uchi Gari for example."
judo,31uq7e,iushiush,1 point,Thu Apr 9 07:08:14 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I really gotta work on my sweeps then. They're terrible.
judo,31uq7e,iushiush,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea. The key to sweeps is timing, which takes a lot of practice.  Don't neglect other techniqes though, even if some are more difficult to execute for a tall person. Usually all throws can be done with all body types, even if the margin for error is a lot smaller for some. Also you never know when they might turn out to be useful."
judo,31uq7e,ammra,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:38:04 2015 UTC,That's true but I think I've been neglecting my sweeps. I come from a wrestling background so sweeps weren't all that common even though they'd probably be devastating. Any tips on the timing of a sweep?
judo,31uq7e,ammra,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"The ""trick"" in De Ashi Harai and sweeping variants of Ko Uchi Gari is, that you have to sweep uke's foot in the short time frame between unencumbered and full weight bearing. When one takes a step and is about to settle the foot down (already ""sending weight to that foot""), is the right moment. To get this right in randori, you have to practice a lot."

judo,31ujne,AofEk,5,Wed Apr 8 06:57:42 2015 UTC,"That's actually an interesting topic I wanted to explore further some time.  Butterfly sweeps are very similar to certain Sumi Gaeshi variants.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aH8aNK08ds  Some turtle turn overs are very similar to certain versions of Hikikomi Gaeshi. The first technique here is a Hikikomi Gaeshi variant (although the video says Daki Wakare), that can also be used against a turtled up opponent:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3u82xa5pkI  A different approach with Hiroshi Katanishi (Obi Tori Gaeshi is actually Hikikomi Gaeshi):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3ncqx1UUyQ  Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi works really well from a kneeling position. Think of this situation, both you and your opponent are on both knees each, but upright and not sitting on your legs while holding each other in the standard grip. Now, if you are agile enough, bring one foot to the front and prace it at the outside of your opponents knee. Now twist him over it to the side. You land on him in side control or Kesa Gatame.  ""Laats' Dive-In"", an  Uki Waza variant can be used as a turtle escape:  http://youtu.be/Htm2UDhEC_Y?t=2h50s (2:50:00)  Same with Seoi Otoshi. If your opponent forgets to plant his hooks before he reaches over your shoulders, you can pull him down over it."

judo,31ujne,OceanRacoon,5,Fri Apr 10 11:21:48 2015 UTC,"I hate to sound so closed-minded but ""knee wrestling"" will imo inhibit both your bjj and your judo. It is impractical to fight for takedowns from there as neither sport is ever in those scenarios aside from practice. The whole point of starting from knees is to omit takedowns due to spacing, pain or inexperience issues. You don't wanna be the guy nobody wants to practice with. Even if you become very good at knee takedowns, it is not making you better at newaza and it is not making you any more coordinated at judo, a sport with some of the most agile people on the planet imo. Its like you'd be showing up to flag football practice trying to tackle everybody. So in your scenario you are not in judo, just bjj right? and you're trying to learn judo while practicing bjj? i'm sure if you just hint at asking your jiu jitsu coach for takedown/judo drills, he'll at least let you do some uchi komi reps after practice or something. bjj guys brown belt and up are no slouch in standing either. But if you must do standup practice while in newaza, work on your grip fighting & posture control especially from bottom butterfly. It translates very well into standing. Again, sorry to sound so condescending, but in my judo and bjj practices we run newaza the exact same: from knees until someone concedes guard or turtle occasionally. Remember, these two sports aren't just about winning in practice; it is about learning and being a great partner that can simultaneously give his teammates a learning environment."
judo,31ujne,opsomath,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:14:21 2015 UTC,"No offense taken.  I'm not looking to compete in points based tournaments.  I very much try to be a good partner.  Tonight I was working with an injury, and basically just did enough of the technique myself to work it a bit, and then I gave most of the time to my partner to work it on me.  He said he was happy to pair with me tonight.  My academy teaches both Judo and BJJ, but I'm not currently taking Judo (I hope to in a few months).  We don't do much knee wrestling, but sometimes my partner prefers not to start standing, and I'll go with their desire.  I was mostly just looking for something to mix in that wasn't just me pulling guard, etc.  And, yes I should play more butterfly.  Thanks for your thoughts."
judo,31ujne,Hesperus,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:57:46 2015 UTC,my dojo has (at my suggestion) started a policy where the lower ranked player gets to call what position newaza randori starts in. it has mostly eliminated knee wrestling from our practice and makes newaza time more productive.

There's a throw on the knees a guy in my club would do, you get your standard grips and then turn and put your leg out, sort of like a kneeling tai otoshi. It was good and makes for a change from the usual aimless tussling on the knees or instantly pulling guard.  I can't think of any way in which adding throws from the knees would actually inhibit either your bjj or your judo; it makes you stronger on the ground in bjj if you want to be on top and it gives you an idea of the mechanics of a throw when you start working more on standup.  People on this sub are just negative Nancys most of the time"
judo,31ujne,Kosoto_Gake,2,Thu Apr 9 19:42:00 2015 UTC,"If you have to start from the ground, start from a realistic position. I like butterfly / seated guard, closed guard, and half guard, as these are places I find myself often. Heck, let them start with a solid osaekomi and work your escapes."

judo,31ujne,ScratchBomb,2,Wed Apr 8 11:33:41 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to say none, but there are few things you can do. Grab around their neck and twist them down, similar to koshi-guruma. You can grab both of their sleeves bring them up and cross-shape them (into an X) and twist them down for some sode-tsurikomi-goshi action. You can lean back with a lapel and sleeve grip using one of your legs to push one of their knees back for some.. yoko-otoshi action perhaps? You can try to overhook one of their arms, and grab the sleeve of the other, to twist them down. I really wouldn't recommend thinking about working on the knees as real training for standup-game, as the name implies, it requires standing up to actually work."

judo,31ug9g,homosexual335,3,Wed Apr 8 06:13:44 2015 UTC,Brown belt in bjj here..  This isnt a very good platform for submissions its more of a transitional position. Generally I use this position to settle someone down by transitioning  between this and regular side control (head and underhook). Once they are settled down far side ude garami ( kimura ) and juji gatame (armbar) are the standard attacks.  If you're in judo go for the pin from here.
judo,31ug9g,judoscott,3,Wed Apr 8 14:17:15 2015 UTC,"Let's say I am lying to the right side of uke holding him in the most common form of Kuzure Kesa Gatame (my right arm under his left arm, instead of around his head).  A positional switch to Ude Garami as /u/Ryvai suggested would be my first choice as well.  Another option would be grabbing his collar deeply with my left hand (my thumb touches the back of his neck) and stepping over with my left leg over his head and planting down my heel next to the left of his neck. Then I pull with my left hand and choke him. If he tries to rise I can lock him in a reverse triangle from there.  His best option of defense against this move is preventing me from stepping over with my left foot. To do so he has to push it away with his left arm. One can catch it easily from there and either go for Ude Garami again or push it down across his body and crush him with Kata Osae Gatame (which is a pin, a choke and a shoulder lock, all in one)."

judo,31ug9g,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Wed Apr 8 10:47:50 2015 UTC,"I was shown that technique first in Judo by a 6th dan who specializes in ne-waza, he hates naming things, so he didn't call it anything other than something painful, hehe. It is definitely not kagato-jime, which is more like the gogoplata in BJJ where you choke with the chin or the dorsal of the ankle. I asked Katanishi about it, but he said that 'kagato' means heel, which would be the backside of your ankle, so that would not make sense, and rather called it (the gogoplata I showed him) ashi-kubi-jime. 'Ashi-kubi' being the dorsal pedis area of the ankle. As to the name of the specific choke you mentioned it is generally called hasami-jime because you choke by creating a scissor motion between choking hand and the leg that creates pressure of the other side :)"

I knew Kagato means heel, but it actually always bugged me, since we choke with the other side of the foot. I assume some westeners with no understanding of Japanese coined that name then.  ""Ashi Kubi Jime"", ""Hasami Jime""... I can live with those. :)  Anyway none of these official Kodokan names it seems. I just looked over the Shime Waza list, but none is even close to these."
judo,31ug9g,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Wed Apr 8 12:14:04 2015 UTC,"That is correct, these names are all just nicknames for special variations and not part of official names of the Kodokan. I think many of these names are old-school, where instead of studying them like we do they had to just learn them from demonstration and the sensei would describe what they were doing instead of following a principle. Most choking or armbar techniques with exotic 'description' names follow a Kodokan principle, like the infamous kannuki-gatame is actually a form of ude-hishigi-te-gatame."

Very true. There are ""rogue-names"" out there, confusing the sh*t out of people who try to learn judo.  Anyway many things seem insufficiently covered by the Kodokan denotions in ne waza."
judo,31ug9g,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Wed Apr 8 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"kuzure-kesa-gatame has an enourmous amount of variations, like ushiro-kesa-gatame, makura-kesa-gatame and so on, which means that the possible submissions are practically endless. But the most standard kuzure-kesa-gatame, where you hold under your opponent's shoulder instead of around the neck is the most basic. From there you can go straight for ude-garami on the far-side arm, or if uke tries to twist out of it, by turning towards you, the arm is usually exposed so you can go straight into udehishigi-waki-gatame, which is perfect for demonstration purposes on gradings for example. The fancy version is, as you mentioned, udehishigi-ashi-gatame, where you trap the opponents arm and bend it using your legs. The most viable variation of those is that you use your hand to bend his hand (L-shaped) upwards and hook your leg around it so that his hand is in a similar position as it would be in ude-garami, except you are using your leg to bend it backwards. L-shape leg vs. opposite L-shaped hand, if that makes sense. Some people refer to this as kesa-garami, but that name is pretty nonsensical :)"

judo,31ug9g,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:10:51 2015 UTC,"If you go for ude-garami you need to switch your feet to be face down, preferably trapping his other arm between your legs, similar to the mune-gatame position."

judo,31ug9g,benevent,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:11:07 2015 UTC,The arm bar you're talking about is possible but is also a real pain to get - I've had a lot more luck just slipping into standard kesa-gatame and shooting the arm triangle.  Much easier to catch and hold on to and an easy switch from kuzure kesa-gatame.

Instead, it performs an upwards lifting/reaping motion that looks somewhat like an osotogari or an uchimata, and uke is thrown forward, as in seoi nage.  My teacher requires it for Sankyu, so I had to learn it recently, but he is satisfied with a static nagekomi demonstration. I haven't seen anyone ever pull it off in randori, or even practice it other than for the grading.  According to my teacher, this is because it's an overly complicated throw, and a Harai Goshi is always preferred for the same situation.  I have however been thrown with it by shodan friend, as a demonstration. Done right, it certainly is one of the nastiest, hardest hitting throws."

judo,31ti0k,Ryvai,2,Thu Apr 9 08:23:45 2015 UTC,"As /u/SVPPB mentioned, Yama-arashi 山嵐, the 'mountain storm' throw is different from harai-goshi. The most significant difference is that harai-goshi is a koshi-waza were uke is thrown around the hip with the help of sweeping the leg. Yama-arashi is te-waza where uke is lifted up with a special same-sided grip and thrown down and over using a slight sweeping motion with the leg already contacting uke's leg. Daigo sensei added a small detail to this throw in a recent seminar I watched on YouTube were he wanted the assisting leg to somewhat curl up behind uke's heel, so that your toe points downward almost contacting the mat behind uke's heel. The hands do the work in this throw, the leg is just there for guidance. I also recommend you read up on the fantastic story behind this epic throw. It is probably the most historically significant technique in Judo, when it comes to the development of the Kodokan, because the legendary tournament where Shiro Saigo, the inventor of this technique, demolished his opponents using Yama-arashi."

I believe the Kodokan is currently working on some new additions to the current classification system, which will see the light of day soon. I think the closest with the current system is ura-nage. However Sacripanti, a well respected Judo-scholar, classifies this throw as 'ushiro-uchimata' (backside/backwards-inner-thigh-throw), and I stand by that assertion.

judo,31k325,booleanerror,9,Sun Apr 5 23:07:47 2015 UTC,"Design follows the function.  In the days Kano practiced Tenjin Shinyo Ryu (late 1870's), his gear looked like this:   http://munndialarts.com/francais/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/kano_17ans.jpg  These are more or less informal everyday garments I guess. They are sleeveless. Everyday clothes were not tough enough to deal with judo for long. Kano had to fix his jacket often and sewed a thicker lapel to it. He used fishing line for sewing , because other materials were not strong enough. His gi finally looked like this:  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eB-TL5eSxX4/UnqN19skgEI/AAAAAAAAFhM/QprvAaNVxXo/s1600/Kano%2BGi.jpg  Why longer sleeves and trousers?   EDIT, found this in the German judo forum:   Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo, lengthened the short sleeves of the jujitsu uniform with the idea of increased safety. This improvement enabled Jigoro Kano to widen and vary the number of offensive techniques. For example, more te-waza and ashi waza could be applied as there was more opportunity to off-balance an opponent with longer sleeves.   - Yoshiaki Todo (Tsukuba University) “The History of Randori in Judo:  the Origins and Development of Randori”, From Bulletin for the Association for the Scientific Studies on Judo, Kodokan, Report VII, 1994, Copyright, Kodokan, Tokyo, Japan.  So it's ""the idea of increased safety"". Makes sense: Short trousers and short sleeves leave the arms exposed, this increases mat burns, abrasions and the risk of contagion with skin diseases.  EDIT 2: Another interesting quote, from the English judo forum:  http://judoforum.com/index.php?/topic/20870-koshiki-no-kata-from-kito-ryu-originally-posted-as-kime-no-kata-from/page__p__306523&#entry306523   ""Interesting to note, Judo gi was modified the same year [1906] into a new type, longer sleeves, longer pants.

judo,31k325,02-6611-0142-1,0,Mon Apr 6 03:14:54 2015 UTC,"It's been speculated that Kano based it on heavy hemp uniforms that japanese firefighters wore, called ""hanten"". I presume it was because he needed an article of clothing tough enough to support a person's bodyweight without ripping. The belt system was created because Kano didn't think that white people would be able to stick to something unless they felt like they were being regularly rewarded. I presume the gi and the belt system were used in other martial arts as a marketing tool, to cash in on the sense of mystery that japan and china had in the western world at the time. There's not really any practical use for a gi in a striking art, especially since they tend to use a thinner and easily ripped variation."

judo,31ixu4,Ryvai,2,Mon Apr 6 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that choke is called hasami-jime (scissor-choke), jigoku-jime is where you strangle controlling both arms of uke."
judo,31ixu4,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:13:30 2015 UTC,Hasami means to hold between 2 other things.  Shes controlling one arm and using the other to choke so im pretty sure it would be a Jigoku Jime. http://judoinfo.com/chokes.htm
judo,31ixu4,lanster100,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure 'hasami' 鋏 means scissor. Most chokes where you choke with one hand and a leg, more often than not, becomes hasami-jime. In jigoku-jime you control both arms of uke and choke using your hand or assist with one leg. It was called the 'hell-strangle' because it was an immensely powerless feeling being held in this position without any arms to defend with, it was dubbed 'hell'. Jigoku-jime is one of my tokui-waza and I've never seen any variation baring resemblance to that choke. But I think I know where  the confusion comes from. There is a variation to jigoku-jime where you assist the strangle with one of your legs while controlling the other. Here is the Kodokan explaining jigoku-jime, @0:38 you can see the variation I am talking about :)"

What really bugged me is, who the f*** taught that seoi otoshi to that kid? Poor opponent was face planted of course. Don't teach that stuff to kids, or if you do, do it so that they don't throw people on their head."
judo,31ixu4,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"No matter what the throw is, droping or not, the uke should know to turn their head and take the fall rather than keeping their head straight out to face plant. I'm not a fan of drop seonage but if that is what the child was taught, then he doesn't really know better than to use it. Whether it was taught in that dojo or one before that."
judo,31ixu4,hitgirl08,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:38:02 2015 UTC,"I'll elaborate.  The technique that (unfortunately) goes by the name ""Drop Seoi Nage"" is in the most cases a Seoi Otoshi (that's when uke is merely pulled down by kneeling tori without rising his hips back up as fulcrum).  This both-knees-down version of Seoi Otoshi is very popular, but since it (a) is about giving up one's stance and (b) jumping down on both knees doesn't sound good for the knees in long term, I'd refrain from teaching it to beginners who still need to learn throwing from a standing position properly and youngsters who might damage their knees. (c) There's a mechanical problem related to this throw: There is just not enough space for the head if uke is just pulled down. Standard ukemi are insufficient to prevent him from hitting the ground with his head (I got injured myself this way in a training situation). (d) To prevent this from happening, uke must know an emergency ukemi variant, which is usually not taught, or tori must pull uke's arm towards his knee in the last moment, which the boy in the video did not. He either forgot, wasn't taught properly or couldn't control the technique. Either way, all these are good reasons not teaching this throw to a little kid. I blame the instructor not the kid, if this isn't clear."

judo,31lozm,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Apr 6 10:01:25 2015 UTC,"Low back pain:       Low back pain or lumbago (/lʌmˈbeɪɡoʊ/) is a common disorder involving the muscles and bones of the back. It affects about 40% of people at some point in their lives. Low back pain (often abbreviated as LBP) may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain.  In most episodes of low back pain, a specific underlying cause is not identified or even looked for, with the pain believed to be due to mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain. If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by ""red flags"" such as unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant problems with feeling or movement, further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem. In most cases, imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful and carry their own risks. Despite this, the use of imaging in low back pain has increased. Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs, and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause. In those with chronic pain, the pain processing system may malfunction, causing large amounts of pain in response to non-serious events.  The treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain is typically with conservative measures such as the use of simple pain medications and the continuation of as much normal activity as the pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful, with acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) as the preferred first medication. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve within a few weeks from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.

judo,31ibbo,Dry_Tatami,2,Sun Apr 5 10:13:11 2015 UTC,For okuri ashi barai the off balancing is huge.  You need to be gradually turning them like they are a huge wheel as you make the steps; lapel grip going up and over and the elbow grip going across in the other direction.  On the final sliding step move it in a bit towards uke and catch his/her foot before it is planted.  If you've done the off balancing correctly uke will go horizontal with the floor.

They are still part of judo though. Unfortunately few judoka ever practice them, except when they do the Katame no Kata, in which the last technique -Ashi Garami- is a leg lock.  One of the few judo sources on that matter is the old book ""Higher Judo Groundwork"" by Moshe Feldenkrais.  I never used leg locks in Judo of course, but in BJJ and Sambo, where they are common and even allowed in sparring and tournament (sometimes depending on the grade or ruleset of the day).  About 2, 4, 5 and 6 from that page:  Nr. 2. Practiced that once in Sambo, never used it.  Nr. 4. Practiced that in ""self defense jujutsu"" and some variant of it in BJJ. The latter might actually work.  Nr. 5. I do that quite often, but usually not to lock them, but to immobilize them. The pain is often insufficent to make the opponent submit.  Nr. 6. and 7. are just variants of 4. This is old nomenclature (probably never officially updated), but the mechanic of the lock is the same in all of them.  How applicable these techniques are, depends on the setup you use. If you are serious about learning it, I'd point you to some sambo club."
judo,31hxy1,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sun Apr 5 07:18:06 2015 UTC,"No. 4 is a Calf Crank/Crush and is definitely a legit submission and is classified as a compression lock.  It is most commonly done as someone kicks and spins out of a knee bar, toe hold, or heel hook.  Your shin will slide into place at the pit of the knee and you finish by pulling yourself into your opponent (bear hug/belt/grapplers lift).  It has even been pulled off in the UFC a couple of times.  Here is Charles Oliveira pulling one off. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FacL7mTGSvs.  If I recall Joe Rogan accused Charles Oliveira of doing it on accident, obviously it was deliberate and the move has been around for over a hundred years."

judo,31hxy1,ManicParroT,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:17:56 2015 UTC,"Well, that leg locks are still part of Judo, can be easily proven: The last technique in the Katame no Kata, Ashi Garami, is a leg lock1 . The Katame no Kata is part of the 2. dan exam in many federations worldwide. Thus quite a number of judoists practices at least one leg lock.  Another point is, that not every judo club has given up upon training self defense techniques or for self defense purposes. In France this is done at least in parts I hear, same in Argentinia for example. I would be surprised if they didn't practice leg locks to some extend.  Another question is, how you define Judo. Personally I see Judo as more than a mere sport (although it can be), for me it is a martial art.

I would try a different one or ask if there are other groups/trainers you can attend. Don't give up on judo. It is a great sport, will help you during police academy and is generally low on injuries."
judo,31fhrb,theunpire,2,Sat Apr 4 16:48:46 2015 UTC,"It's definitely competition based. A few of the guys have been to international tournaments. It didn't seem like getting carried away, it was just straight up yelling. I might attend a different one just to see. I appreciate the feedback. It seemed really cool, I don't want to give up on it."
judo,31fhrb,fedornuthugger,3,Sat Apr 4 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, normal behaviour would be to - tell both beginner students to slow down - correctly place the hands on the lapel - guide them through the choke. Then reset the randori once both students have an understanding of the correct technique to be applied."
judo,31fhrb,wingingitman,12,Sun Apr 5 15:46:25 2015 UTC,"Depends. For my school at least, if you walked in on a competition team training, you would see a lot of ""tough love"". Not quite that bad, but we definitely expect more of them and that comes out in coaching.  The thing is, especially in randori, criticism has to be direct and it has to be fast and to-the-point. A good coach (in my opinion) know how to buffer that with positives. ie ""COME ON COMBO! BAM GOOD AGAIN!"" Our coaches are good in that they spend time learning what each athlete responds to best, but it is a fine line to walk. I would argue that given that particular context it can be appropriate coaching, however we make sure students are aware of that and are given other options.  Contrast that to our ""normal"" workouts and you will see a much calmer atmosphere, gentler criticisms, and a lot more patience. We still might call out our competition team members, but even that gets toned down. It helps keep the club accessible to everyone. And, most importantly, it still produces skilled athletes (perhaps at a slower pace).  For injuries... they happen. The higher the intensity, the more likely they are, but even our more relaxed workouts see their share of injuries. It most often happens to lower ranks, especially when playing against other lower ranks.  Should you continue to train? I can't say. I don't mind the aggressive coaching, personally. If somebody were slapping my hand I'd be irritated because I understand words just fine. The big questions to ask yourself:   Am I comfortable training here, does it feel safe? Do I think what this club offers is in line with my personal goals (including style of teaching, level of instruction, competition focus, etc)? Assuming so, will there be enough support for me to reach those goals? Will this be fun for me, or something I end up forcing myself to do, until I eventually quit?   Obviously there are other considerations and finding the ""perfect"" school can be really difficult. If you are unsure, there is nothing wrong with taking it a few weeks or a month at a time. Maybe write down your impressions of each practice you attend and then look back on it to help make a decision.  Judo is great and I hope you find what you're after."
judo,31fhrb,NittanyOrange,2,Sat Apr 4 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for all the feedback. Apparently some of the students are doing a big tournament soon, so that might be where it's coming from. I would like to compete, but to be honest I don't think I'll ever go to the level some of these guys are competing, they just seemed really intense. I appreciate all the advice. I'll keep looking and learning. Thank you."
judo,31fhrb,flowgod,5,Sat Apr 4 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"It seems a bit more intense than normal. Not too far out of the realm of believability for sure, but a bit odd.  A bunch of injuries is one possible piece of evidence that a club isn't following the 'mutual benefit' part of Judo ethos."
judo,31fhrb,Hippocampus88,2,Sat Apr 4 17:39:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. Yeah I just don't know if the intensity is right for me.
judo,31fhrb,Hippocampus88,5,Sat Apr 4 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds normal for a gym that emphasises competition.The reality here is that you are training to fight. Being nice and soft during practice allows bad habits to form and doesn't prepare you for a fight. That said, that kind of training isn't for everyone. If you just want to learn technique, but don't have any desire of ever using it practically then you may want to find a different school."
judo,31fhrb,runningwithsharpie,6,Sat Apr 4 21:17:17 2015 UTC,"I know that kind of drilling from lessons with very ambitious competitors. This is usually for people that aim to compete nationally or higher and need that kind of drill. When I go to these lessons, I know what to expect and it's fine to me, but I'm doing Judo for over 10 years, so I can handle it. On this level smaller injuries can happen (like a concussion, a broken toe or some bruises here and there; bigger injuries are very rare though.  BUT for people without full contact experience this can be dangerous and demotivating. If you just want to learn Judo moves and do something for yourself, go look for another academy."

judo,31he0b,kfa4303,3,Sun Apr 5 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"This technique is known in Judo as Ude Gaeshi.  This is not official Kodokan nomenclature. If you want to go by the official name, it depends on the conclusion of the technique. If the technique ends without an armlock, it is classified as a throw: Yoko Wakare. If it ends in an armlock it is just considered to be that: an armlock. The name would be Ude Hishigi Te Gatame then."

judo,31he0b,carasci,1 point,Sun Apr 5 05:52:14 2015 UTC,"To nitpick a bit, depending on who you talk to the classification may not depend on the ending so much as the way in which uke is forced to fall.  In Yoko Wakare, uke is thrown by being pulled downwards and forwards in a rotating motion which usually leads to them traveling directly over tori's body.  This is a regular unbalancing motion, but distinguished from other sacrifice throws because it doesn't incorporate a trip - sort of like Sumi Otoshi while falling.  Ude Hishigi Te Gatame, on the other hand, forces uke to fall via a twisting force on the arm.  Rather than uke traveling over tori, this usually leads to uke falling north of tori's head as tori spins them down.  Thus, even if they're classified based on the end, the two are almost completely different in terms of setup and execution."
judo,31he0b,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"Well it is not a standard Yoko Wakare of course, but a variant. The classification of Ude Gaeshi as Yoko Wakare (if it does not end in Ude Hishigi Te Gatame) is not my idea, the former Kodokan page said so (the specific page does no longer exist).  This one looks a lot more like the standard Yoko Wakare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dC_Mm8Do-s  EDIT: Here's the statement on the old Kodokan site, look for ""Common waza names apt to be used incorrectly"":  https://web.archive.org/web/20100731015014/http://www.kodokan.org/e_waza/index.html   Ude-gaeshi: When you throw with completing any Kansetsu-waza, it is not regarded as nage-waza.  When you throw without completing any Kansetsu-waza, then it is regarded as ""Yoko-wakare""."
judo,31he0b,carasci,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:00:25 2015 UTC,"Well it is not a standard Yoko Wakare of course, but a variant.   That was mostly what I was trying to get at.  The Kodokan is using Yoko Wakare as a catchall for ""any failed Kansetsu-waza that nonetheless results in a successful throw,"" but that doesn't mean that an intentional Yoko Wakare has much in common with the variant.  It's a useful distinction as a referee, perhaps, but kinda useless for someone trying to sort them out themself.  Notice how in the ""more like the standard Yoko Wakare"" version there's no actual pressure or torsion on tori's arm, and thus no standing armlock (even though uke is thrown in such a way that the throw can be followed by a ground armlock)."
judo,31he0b,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:56:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, so we agree it's a variant, but still Yoko Wakare?  This ""catchall"" principle by the Kodokan, using broad categories, is actually a good idea imho. If we tried to have official names for each and every possible variant and subvariant it would end in complete chaos and thousands of names no one could remember. Putting principles first helps keeping an overview. It's true though, that in a few cases there is overly conservative traditionalism at work, which can be a hindrance.   there's no actual pressure or torsion on tori's arm   Hard to tell. It's possible that uke reacts before here the torque becomes too bad or he just isn't that flexible.   but kinda useless for someone trying to sort them out themself   Well, it is not forbidden using your own names for specific variants. Even Japanese masters of old did so: ""Tengu Nage"", ""The crushed Lantern"", ""Nanma Otoshi""...  Once one accepts, that each technique name actually covers a wide range of possible ways to make use of a certain biomechanical principle at it's core, it gets easier to deal with this stuff in research.  One can look at other techniques and ask: Hey maybe I can do that differently?  There are variants of Ippon Seoi Nage and Uki Goshi for example, that use torsion and/or arm locking as well (some of them unsafe for use in sport context)."
judo,31he0b,carasci,1 point,Mon Apr 6 07:08:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, so we agree it's a variant, but still Yoko Wakare?   The Kodokan's the final authority in any case, but even if we set it aside I'd say there are several reasonable definitions that would group the two techniques.  However, if I'm understanding the way they're being performed I'd say they're still a lot further apart than kouchi geri/gake or o/tsuri goshi etc.   Hard to tell. It's possible that uke reacts before here the torque becomes too bad or he just isn't that flexible.   Possibly, but after watching it in slow motion a couple of times I'm not sure tori could have applied any torque to the arm even if he tried.  What allows for the torque is tori's position off to the side of uke, where tori's spin ends up twisting uke's arm with respect to the body.  When tori moves in front of uke, tori's spin instead winds uke's arm in towards tori's body and pulls uke forwards.  Tori's spin remains largely the same, but the change in position shifts its direction relative to uke - instead of the spin being pointed almost into the arm, tori is now rolling away from uke.  I haven't had a chance to play with it or anything, but looking at a few examples I don't think I'd be able to apply similar pressure to the arm from the front, at least not without a very visible change in execution.  Imagine it sort of like a weird gyaku ude garami with the hands reversed, and it's easy to see why it would probably stop working when moved to the front.  (Well, that or you'll think about it and go ""that doesn't make any sense,"" in which case I'm not explaining it well.)   This ""catchall"" principle by the Kodokan, using broad categories, is actually a good idea imho. If we tried to have official names for each and every possible variant and subvariant it would end in complete chaos and thousands of names no one could remember. Putting principles first helps keeping an overview. It's true though, that in a few cases there is overly conservative traditionalism at work, which can be a hindrance.   For the most part I agree with you, but it seems like really adopting that would require a pretty extreme change in how techniques are defined and described.  If nothing else, going in that direction would completely eliminate all geri/gake pairs, uki/tsuri/o goshi (not to mention koshi guruma, sode tsurikomi goshi etc.)....probably close to half of the core techniques could legitimately be eliminated as variations on a handful of basics.  There's definitely a difference between reaping a planted leg, sweeping a lifting/falling leg and blocking someone over a stationary leg, but all three are far closer than many of the ""variation"" techniques out there.  It's even possible to make a case for consolidating the soto/uchi ashi-waza, though I wouldn't go that far and they're not really a source of confusion.   Once one accepts, that each technique name actually covers a wide range of possible ways to make use of a certain biomechanical principle at it's core, it gets easier to deal with this stuff in research.   It's that first part where I was really on the fence.  In the side-along version, if tori loses uke's elbow it looks like uke could just let them spin down without having to worry.  In the front version, the elbow control seems largely irrelevant (i.e. having looked at a few dozen of them while poking at this I haven't found any where elbow control is present, yet it still makes people fall over), and the technique is more of a classic unbalancing augmented by tori's bodyweight.  Hence, I was wondering whether or not they were ""really"" based on the same biomechanical principle despite being fairly similar visually.  It's almost a philosophy thing....in some ways they're basically identical, in others they're nothing alike, but in general they seem to be a lot more alike than different.  I'd say you've given me some insight into the justification behind it, and I think my reaction is mostly coming from the fact that I've always drawn a very hard line between ""joint-locking throws"" (kote gaeshi et al.) and ""everything else.""  If nothing else, I've moved from wondering why these examples were under the same umbrella to wondering why various others remain separated.  Either way, thanks for taking the time to explain."
judo,31he0b,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:27:14 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to explore Ude Gaeshi further is trying it on the mats.  I've used it a few times in standup randori, but didn't really commit to it, because I was afraid of hurting my partner. Thus I had little success with it. You can use the same movement in ne waza randori as well though and catch kneeling oppoents who use the vulnerable overarm grip. I did this once in a while. Kind of sweet when it works.   ... and I think my reaction is mostly coming from the fact that I've always drawn a very hard line between ""joint-locking throws"" (kote gaeshi et al.) and ""everything else.""   Understandable. It's a very rare thing in modern judo. Looking at the origin of many throws though, there's a lot of locking and twisting involved. I was shown a very old school Ippon Seoi Nage variant recently, where one caught and twisted uke's arm in a way, that he basically had to throw himself to escape the torque.   Either way, thanks for taking the time to explain.   Welcome!"
judo,31he0b,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:59:21 2015 UTC,"This thing about ude-gaeshi is that if an armlock is applied, it is not considered nage-waza, thus the end technique is what determines the name. If an armlock is not applied, it becomes yoko-wakare, if an armlock is performed, it becomes skillful entry to ne-waza and ude-hishigi-te-gatame :)"
judo,31he0b,carasci,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"That's true, but not quite what I was trying to get at.  I do understand what the Kodokan is doing, and technique classification's obviously their purview.  However, given the different methods (and the distinctions drawn, for example, between techniques like ko-soto-geri and ko-soto-gake) I was trying to find a way to articulate that while their official classification is based on the ending their actual execution (as I'm seeing it, anyways) is different and not substitutable.  That is, the version shown isn't just ""yoko-wakare with a slightly different grip so you can get ude-hishigi-te-gateme at the end,"" it's  involves a significantly different body movement, positions tori differently in relation to uke, and relies on very different body mechanics to get uke moving.  Thus, while knowing the official classification is useful it's not very helpful for understanding what the technique is and/or how it works.  Well, that or maybe my own background is just causing me to seize on a minor difference that everyone else is viewing as unimportant - let me try to describe it.  What I'm seeing is two totally different and mutually incompatible approaches to the throw: one that applies a standing armlock and then forces uke to fall forwards by twisting the arm forwards (ideally landing into an armlock on the ground), and a second which throws uke using a more ""textbook"" approach which doesn't place any pressure on the arm but instead rotates uke forwards and over tori (but also offers an armlock on the ground).  Both of these can obviously lead into an ude-hishigi-te-gatame on the ground and both can lead to an effective throw while failing to succeed at ude-hishigi-te-gatame, but other than that they feel very different.  Specifically, look right about 9-10s into the first video, where tori seems to be locking uke's hand to his armpit and then twisting forwards, using the braced lapel arm to torque uke forwards using pressure around the elbow (i.e. a standing armlock used to throw); compare to right at 13s in the second, where there's clearly no torque at all on uke's arm or elbow and uke falls due to the diagonal pull forwards.  In the first case, it feels like if tori loses control of uke's elbow (and by extension the torsion on the arm) uke could just let him spin down and there'd be no hope at all of a controlled throw to the back, but in the second case tori doesn't even try to control uke's elbow because the change in positioning leads to a pull on the arm instead of a twist.  The first version almost seems closer a weird variation on gyaku ude garami with the hands swapped (imagine how it would look if uke's arm were much more bent), though I know that's a weird way to look at it.  As I said, probably just me looking at it funny."
judo,31he0b,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:00:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for the clarification. In this context, does ""Yoko"" denote ""side"" as we use it in Aikido (ex. Yoko menuchi = strike to the side of the head)?  I would've probably called it some sort of mune doir, kaiten nage (lapel grab to barrel roll), or something like that, but that didn't seem very accurate."
judo,31fgei,MMonReddit,5,Sat Apr 4 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"The throw you mentioned might be a seoi nage entry that changes to ouchi gari, but without knowing which leg you are sweeping, which leg you are using, and if you are coming form the inside or outside, I can't fully be sure.  Unfortunately, technique names are REALLY specific sometimes.  There is nothing wrong with asking the sensei ""What is this called?"" or just asking after class.  You can also ask someone higher ranking than you, as they might know.  Your other option would be to look up a list of Judo techniques, and just go down the line, and look up videos."

For foot throws, you should mention if you move your leg inbetween our outside of your opponents legs. And 2nd thing, if you're attacking in the direction of your toes or your heel of the attacking leg.  that way you can look it up yourself as most of the names follow this nomenclature:   Ko=small (toe-wise); O=big (heel-wise)  soto=outside; uchi=inside  the move you learned could've been ko-uchi-maki-komi; o-uchi-gari or even tani-otoshi (you see, this one does not follow the ""easy"" nomenclature of foot throws)."

judo,31ccr2,Merciless1,3,Fri Apr 3 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"Kenka-yotsu battles tend to revolve around the battle for that tsurite grip and this one started no different. When Figueroa got the lapel, Cherniak was able to come over the top from outside and get Figueroa's lapel, apply pressure down on the elbow to break her posture and harass her with ashiwaza pretty well.  When Cherniak got inside first, Figueroa did try doing this (coming over the top from outside) herself, but that was never going to happen, so she got left with the armpit grip which is never good in that situation as it was too easy to drag her head down.  She will probably be annoyed that she got caught on the wrong foot for the first wazari when that big arm got thrown over the top, though it seemed a little 50/50 initially, maybe there was an uranage or she could of shot her hips infront if Cherkiak was not controlling the sleeve, pulling it up and away from Figueroa's body.  After more of the same tsurite battle and as time wore on, it looked like maybe Figueroa was reaching deep round the back/waist herself, surrendering that top grip to go for something else, then classic story, came on too strongly and got thrown.  I know you didn't ask for a play by play, but I think next time they meet Figueroa needs to have something planned from an underhook/round the waist type position, because she is not getting over the top of that arm and anytime she gets the lapel herself, Cherniak can do so too easily.   To be frank, if I didn't know better I would never guess those women were in the same weight class from the height difference. Not sure if Figueroa is a short tank or Cherniak is a lanky stick..."
judo,31ccr2,TCamilo19,2,Fri Apr 3 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"Now I am not an expert at tactics at this level, but it seems to me that Figueroa didn't have any answer for that power-arm that is dragging her down and dominating her posture. As mentioned earlier kenka-yotsu tends to be a fight about who can secure the power-hand in the best possible position. I'd use every trick up my sleeve to diminish the opponents chances of ever securing the high-grip. My favorite counter for the high-grip is what I call the 90° seoi-nage. You grab the hikite of the opponents power-hand with your left hand, you then cross-grip the opponents collar with your right hand. Pull down once to create a reaction, as uke is coming up rotate slightly to your right, the opponent now has to move slightly to posture up, as this happens I attack forwards with seoi-nage perpendicular to the power-hand, as in 90° to my left. This creates an awkward situation to deal with for uke and is very effective. This move got me a 15 second ippon in last year's nationals :p"

If leg grabs were still an option, there might have been an opportunity here or two...  With her opponent being taller and going for the collar grip, keeping a bit more distance in grip fighting (going for the sleeve ends) may be a way to go. It's hard to go for the offense from that far though when being shorter.  As for techniques to try: Ippon Seoi Nage (trapping the arm coming for the collar grip), Sode Tsuri Komi Goshi, O Goshi or Uki Goshi.  At 24:00 she has close hip contact at the side of her opponent and an underhook. I don't know if it would have been possible, but there's a trick: if locked in such a situation, one can try a hip push, create an opening, enter with one's own hips and throw Uki Goshi.  Again, all easier said than done. I'm a nobody and those are international top players."
judo,31b2ir,RatioFitness,11,Fri Apr 3 13:30:16 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from and I would agree that from a self-defense perspective remaining standing, or landing in a pin-like position are superior outcomes.  However, the thing to consider is that the level of resistance from opponents who understand and practice the same art is significant compared to an untrained individual. If I want to throw a resisting judoka of comparable skill, sometimes I have to try to bury them. That often means putting more energy into my actions (not necessarily force, but certainly enthusiasm). I can't always put on the brakes, remain standing, or land in a strong control position.  Is my follow-through into a roll an application of technique purely for sport? Yes. Does that make it an inferior throw? I would argue, based on the context in which it is applied, no."
judo,31b2ir,wingingitman,5,Fri Apr 3 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer, I train Danzan Ryu Jujutsu (DZR), but it has many similarities to Judo.  I find that the amount of energy that you need to put into a throw depends on how much your opponent fights, and how well they are defending against what you are doing specifically.  For example, in DZR randori, the other person knows you want to throw them.  They are specifically defending against this, and even when you get them to go, they know what is generally coming and resist.  In some of these cases, I will have to go whole body into the throw,  On the other hand, when I do Krav Maga training, they don't emphasize throws there.  If I go to throw someone, I have an easy time.  As far as real world goes, you're going to get a mix.  Your opponent may be strong, and you may need to really go into the throw to get them down because you NEED to get them down at all costs, or the position that you are in is such that if you don't get them down, it will be to your detriment."
judo,31b2ir,Black6x,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:10:39 2015 UTC,"Think you hit the nail on the head. It depends why you're trying to throw them in the first place. I cross train BJJ and with hip throws I drop my shoulder into my opponent (competition only) but I would NEVER let myself fall with a shoulder throw, that is just asking to be choked."
judo,31b2ir,improcrasinating,2,Fri Apr 3 15:35:26 2015 UTC,"A ""superior throw"" would be one, where you do nearly nothing and the opponent throws him self with his own weight and movement, following the highest judo principle ""sei ryoku zen yo"" (best use of energy, maximum efficiency)  Maybe Uchi mata sukashi in go no sen (reaction to attack):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOukoJw25hc  In sen no sen (own attack) maybe something like Ko soto Gari.  Sacrifice throws have a lot of ""ju no ri"" (principle of yielding)  ."
judo,31b2ir,fleischlaberl,2,Sat Apr 4 09:32:59 2015 UTC,"I also prefer to stay standing or land in a pin, but I view the whole ""throw yourself and your opponent version of throwing to be as much an aspect of judo as the other styles of throwing.  It takes lots of energy and control, and is often necessary at a high level of competition.  Not everyone focuses on competition though.  I only get bent out of shape when people can't perform a throw standing and always go to the mat, even during more compliant nagekomi type drills."

judo,319j8z,xin05,5,Fri Apr 3 11:49:48 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell cuz we can't see their hips/legs. Body positioning (hip distance) looked less like a throw and more like an arm torque/drop. Guessing aikido.  He was being nice though. Didn't bounce him off that pole. And the video cut but it looked like he was checking on him.  EDIT: Found it, ""kote gaeshi"". It's hard to find a demo without ten kan and follow up, but these Jiujutsu guys demonstrate just the lock well. A supinating wristlock is more about radioulna/shoulder bind and the dickhead can't relieve pressure and basically throws himself.  https://youtu.be/3bGH9v6OYa4"
judo,319j8z,infernalspacemonkey,3,Fri Apr 3 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"Having done a lot of aikido/japanese jujitsu, I don't think it's kote gaeshi: the inside (right) hand comes to the inside of uke's right elbow as he throws.  If it's kote gaeshi, tori would have done the wrist lock entirely with his left hand, which I suppose is possible, but very unlikely and unorthodox.  I also think kote gaeshi, done on someone who doesn't know ukemi, doesn't result in that sort of fall.  This looks more like one of the aikido ""kokyu nage"" techniques, where the throw is done without a lock, but instead relies on manipulating uke's posture/balance.  I think we have a similar technique in my Japanese jujitsu school (it's hard to tell because the video doesn't show what tori's body and hands are doing).  Something like this at around 0:26 where tori's left hand is on top of uke's right hand on tori's lapel to trap it, and the throw comes from dropping uke into his loss of balance point on his right by tori turning hips to extend uke's arm and then dropping some weight through uke's elbow."
judo,319j8z,chengjih,1 point,Fri Apr 3 10:31:42 2015 UTC,I think you're right. Although the nage's body is blocking our view this looks more like the technique without the momentum it does look like kata tetori.

judo,319j8z,infernalspacemonkey,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:44:46 2015 UTC,I started my training in Japanese jiujitsu before coming to judo. I often hear judoka and Brazilian jujitsu guys talk about how unrealistic these aikido-like standing wrist locks are and started to believe I had wasted my time learning them. It's actually cool to see a real world example of it working!
judo,319j8z,user079,2,Fri Apr 3 08:03:46 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on context. These days MMA is considered the gold standard for what works in a fight and taking somebody down there with a wrist lock is a one in a million shot. However, MMA is not really representative of the majority of real-world fight situations and, like here, sometimes you'll get a chance to surprise an untrained idiot that's sticking his arms out."

Pavia is my personal pick for gold at Rio in u57, though it did not occur to me that Silva would be on home soil. Off the top of my head I think they are tied 2-2 against each other. Looking forward to their next meeting when Pavia returns from injury.  Some good newaza from Lipertiliani at around ten minutes.

Pavia is great but she has some difficulties with the japanese.  P.S.: Had to laugh cause of your statement to Adams. This were also my first thoughts, when I heard the video the first minute.

Like many others I'm just waiting for the next Koga or Inoue to idolise I guess.  Yeah Pavia has had a lot of trouble with the Japanese, maybe it's a psychological thing, though she recently beat Udaka (great harai-makikomi, can't remember which event) after losing to her in the semi finals at Chelyabinsk, so maybe she has overcome that mental block."

I doubt you will find anyone who can tell you both a comparison of foam/tires for falling on AND the nose-reducing properties of both.  I would do the following:  Look at our video and the one on JudoInfo.  Make your plan.  Submit your plan to your landlord and describe how you think it will improve things.  Get your landlord's approval in writing.  If you do everything without that last step, your landlord can just come back and say ""Not enough noise reduction.""  There's no way you can make things silent, so noise reduction will be very subjective and there won't be a way of knowing how well it works until it's done."

You need a decent idea of what your floor structure is currently to be able to figure out what means will be most effective for addressing noise- typically it takes a combination of mass and resilience (i.e. springiness). So a sprung floor will help, but if you're looking to fix the problem you probably need to do more research."

He was married to Kim Kyong-hui, the only daughter of former North Korean supreme leader Kim Il-sung, the only sister of former North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-il and the aunt of Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader of North Korea.    Although the precise extent of Jang Sung-taek's power and position cannot be confirmed, in 2008 South Korean government officials and academic North Korea experts suggested that he had taken on de facto leadership over North Korea while Kim Jong-il's health was declining and when Kim subsequently died.  Jang was vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission, a position considered second only to that of the Supreme Leader.  He is believed to have been promoted to four-star general around the time of Kim Jong-il's death as his first appearance in uniform was while visiting Kim lying in state.  Jang was considered a ""key policy adviser"" to Kim Jong-un.   In December 2013, Jang was abruptly accused of being a counter-revolutionary and was stripped of all his posts and expelled from the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). His photos were retroactively removed from official media and his image digitally removed from photos with other Korean leaders.  On 13 December, North Korea state media announced he had been executed.  There have been external reports that his entire extended family had also been killed.

judo,313ttl,judokalinker,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:17:31 2015 UTC,I think the new rules would suit his style again now. Gone are the tailored jackets that you couldn't get a grip on. He has a nice stand up style (no leg grabs) and a range of big throws to the both sides. Those left handed harai's were awesome. He weighed in at 110kg and just over six feet tall. To be fair all of his line up were giving away weight to him but he was surprisingly mobile for a big guy. Covered up on the ground but damned good judo.
judo,313ttl,realyfunky,2,Thu Apr 2 01:31:57 2015 UTC,"At this demonstration at the Budokai in 1989 Angelo Parisi was five years out of competition (6th dan) and was far away from top shape. As some heavyweights he gained a lot of weight after competing. As you said todays rules and gi's would favour Parisis style. He was able to the throw the really big guys (120kg and more) with left and right taio and harai and had cause of his speed and timing also a decent game with ashi waza. When the japanese (Yamashita, Saito) couldn't participate in the Olympic Games in Moscow 1980 (olympia boycott cause of Afghanistan invasion with the USSR troops) they said, that Angelos Judo was the most worth looking at.   ."

I think the new regulations towards better gripable Gis is a good thing. with the old, very stiff gis classical judo throws like morote seoi nage were very hard to pull off.  And in the end, judo is about gripping, throwing and learning. Not about about wearing armor, so nobody can grip/throw and nobody can learn.

judo,310yh4,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Wed Apr 1 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"As usual I'd like to kick off the discussion with a bad example from my video link lists. This time we have this Tai Otoshi:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJyXWSe7_ys  Do you agree it is bad? Why? Why not?    The entry point to the video link lists can be found here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/2qh230/go_kyu_no_waza_first_set_video_list_the_good_the/  I keep updating it. If you have suggestions for additions or omissions, please let me know."
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,2,Wed Apr 1 06:30:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree it is very bad. There's lots to get into but two of the most glaring issues;   Look how poor his posture is when he is at the point of throw. It's hard to see the first time because uke is blocking him, but he is crooked as a question mark, with far too much weight on his left leg and head forward of his toes by quite a way. The position of the tsurite (sleeve) arm. More noticeable on the second throw he performs but it is flared, with his elbow pointing in the air rather than at the ground as it should be.   Edit - tsurite not tsurikomi."
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,1 point,Wed Apr 1 09:56:25 2015 UTC,"I think you mean tsurite?  Anyway, yes I think you are spot on. And there's a lot more to point out about this video.  Uke is bent forward as well. As far as I understand it, one has to ""make uke tall"" before one can throw him with Tai Otoshi. Uke's bent over pose is a direct result of the wrong use of the hands you pointed out. As a result uke can easily shift his weight back and prevent the throw."
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"That is what I meant, have edited my original post.  I can forgive the errors in this video more than some of the other bad examples as the people involved are Kyu grades, and quite young at that. But then I have to wonder who has encouraged them to post it online? I wonder if any of them will ever see some of these conversations and respond..."
judo,310yh4,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"I follow some unwritten rules when I select bad examples:   No practice footage: It would be unfair to criticise people who try to learn stuff and were filmed doing so. Same with people who explicitly say, that they are merely showing their current progress. No cheap shots: I won't use footage of people who obviously lack the physical or mental ability to do better or are unable to assess their technique. In other words I won't criticise little kids or handicapped people for example. No beginners. Let's say a whitebelt was filmed demonstrating a technique during an exam. Even if it is a demo I wouldn't consider it fair, including such footage in my list of bad examples.   (I ignore all these rules when picking good examples though.)  Those two young men in the sample clip have created an entire channel dedicated to judo, showing the whole grading programme of the DJB from whitebelt to brownbelt. Over two hours of footage. While I must admire their effort to some degree, I can only shake my head about the terrible grasp of technique they have. Two hours of shitty judo is still shitty judo.  The problem is, that they try to teach in their videos. They advertised their channel with the tagline ""the perfect selection for all judoka up to brownbelt"". One should at least point out, that this is not perfect, because there are beginners out there, who may not be able to tell rightaway. Some of the stuff they do can actually be harmful for uke or even tori."
judo,310yh4,Anthony126517,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:46:35 2015 UTC,I think those are some pretty solid guidelines to follow.   I'd 100% agree that anyone who has the intention of teaching should absolutely have their technique held up for scrutiny. It would be wrong not to do so really.
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,2,Wed Apr 1 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"There are probably a dozen things to point out. But I think the easiest flaw to grasp for beginners (also an extremely prominent one) is the fact that when tori is moving backwards with uke he suddenly steps back into him for his entry, effectively stopping uke from moving forwards to unbalance him. Instead there is a complete stop and the movement is lost, so uke is then forced over the leg instead of pulled over by unbalance and the work of the hands. Just take a look at people doing seoi-nage moving backwards, almost everyone forgets this. When moving backwards one needs to create space :)"
judo,310yh4,fleischlaberl,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:17:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, the ""hikidashi"" here is atricious. One can turn in place, but not for this throw (at least not like this) and not at this distance. And one may not take a break. Also the amount of hip action involved clearly shows that these guys haven't grasped the idea of this hand throw.  It's a bit like watching some kind of cargo cult. The actions somewhat resemble the real thing, but they are completely bereft of any functionality."
judo,310yh4,Ryvai,3,Wed Apr 1 15:27:25 2015 UTC,Anyway to improve balance standing?
judo,310yh4,fedornuthugger,3,Wed Apr 1 08:33:27 2015 UTC,"In Judo, often poor balance = poor posture. I'd look into seeing if you have any of the typical posture problems, ie anterior pelvic tilt, forward head etc and if so, work on improving these.  After that, exercises that improve core strength will help with maintaining good posture in judo situations and you will find your balance not being compromised as often.  Then of course there are lots of exercises that can help develop your 'sense of balance' such as balance boards/yoga balls or things like shadow uchikomi that others have mentioned."
judo,310yh4,Ryvai,2,Wed Apr 1 09:50:56 2015 UTC,"Shadow Uchi Komi is the first method coming to mind. Practinging the entry movements for Uchi Mata, O Soto Gari, O Uchi Gari and other throws where tori stands on a single leg may be helpful.  Another user mentioned standing on a yoga ball and as an advanced exercise standing on a yoga ball catching and throwing a medicine ball."
judo,310yh4,H2Outbreak,2,Wed Apr 1 09:12:58 2015 UTC,"Thats a very important question!!  Why?  To have a good balance is your defence and games are first won by good defence! Its like a homebase, an area, where you can not/hardly be touched. If you have a good balance, you are much more relaxed, if you are relaxed, you dont spend much energy, if you dont spend much energy your mind is free and open to move like and where you want to, to see the openings of uke and to act (sen no sen) and to react (go no sen) very quickly.   There are three keys for good balance:  shizen tai = natural posture  tai sabaki = body movement in balance (your GOD is always within the support of GOD)  tsugi ashi = movement of feet  ."
judo,310yh4,silvaphysh13,2,Wed Apr 1 10:21:15 2015 UTC,"tsugi-ashi is a specific movement of the feet where 'foot following foot'. It's like fencers usually move where one foot leads up to the other. There's also ayumi-ashi, which is more like regular walking, where the one leg goes further than the other. Suri-ashi is where the feet slide almost in contact with the ground. Both ayumi-ashi and tsugi-ashi can be done with or without suri-ashi :)"
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,2,Wed Apr 1 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"Basic gymnastics floor work did wonders for my balance. Like others have said, core strength exercises are key here. Practicing your balance is also important, whether it's with balance boards or whether you simply test your balance daily on the balls of one foot while you wait for a bus. Your balance will only get better if you practice/train regularly."
judo,310yh4,silvaphysh13,2,Wed Apr 1 11:51:42 2015 UTC,"Bad balance is often the result of improper movement and or bad posture. To improve that I'd practice how to properly switch between the two main walking patterns in Judo; ayumi-ashi and tsugi-ashi, crossing your legs is often a beginner mistake. Also it's a good idea to practice shadow movement for certain throws. Tons of exercises can be seen in  this video :)"
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,2,Wed Apr 1 12:12:53 2015 UTC,The conventional advice for gripping seems to be - pick a stance (right or left) and stick to it to develop your game and assert your strategy in shiai. My questions are:    1- What are the drawbacks of a right handed person developing a left handed game from the beginning.  2- Does anyone successfully employ an ambidextrous game by not engraining a sidedness...  take whatever grip becomes available during a fight and capitalize on it.
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,2,Wed Apr 1 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"I would say there are no intrinsic drawbacks to either side, as every technique is completely ambidextrous. I know a number of right-handed people who play left. While most people strongly favor one side, it's always a great idea to have a couple moves for each type of grip in the back of your mind. My usual approach is to let my opponent take their favorite grip, then react to it accordingly. Some would argue that this is a risky tactic, but I feel that it's ultimately the most judo-like way to handle kumi-kata."
judo,310yh4,sawskankredemption,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"I'd take issue with your first point. Whilst every technique is ambidextrous, every person isn't. I like to think of ambidextrisity (is that even a word?) as a sort of spectrum. At one end you have those who can do everything left and right with equal ease, then there are those who are entirely useless with their wrong side at the other, with plenty of space in between.   My experience coaching novice judoka tells me that the majority of people definitely have a preferred side, or a side they find much easier to start learning their techniques, though it does not always correlate with what hand they use to write their signature."
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,2,Wed Apr 1 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I was just saying that there aren't any techniques that can only be done on one side. I agree completely about the ambidexterity spectrum, as well. I've also found that it usually pays to try a new throw on both sides after you've done it for a bit, because there's the occasional technique that, for whatever reason, works better for you on your non-dominant side."
judo,310yh4,derioderio,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"Fair point, guess I just misunderstood your response in relation to the original question.  I'd agree, for me sumi-gaeshi works much better left handed, though if course things are not always as simple with sacrifice techniquea."
judo,310yh4,TCamilo19,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:35:00 2015 UTC,"This is a good question, think you might get a lot of long and varied answers. Here's my view on it;   This is going to be highly dependant on the individual. Someone less coordinated will have a harder time doing so, especially if he is working with other beginners and is finding himself often in kenka-yotsu (left v right). The symmetry offered by ai-yotsu (left v left or right v right)  makes grasping the positioning and turning in stages of a throw easier along with movements like tsurikomi just being simpler in general. Judo has a pretty steep learning curve as it is, why make it steeper? On the other had, if someone is coming to Judo with some boxing experience, their natural inclination will be to stand the opposite way to what we in Judo would consider normal. ie a right handed boxer would have his right foot back instead of forward like a judoka. I think such a person could probably get away with it, sure, it may even make the early stages easier. There are probably many people who advocate a 'come what may' approach, acting reactively and try to throw both sides. I'm not sure how successful you could be in the competitive environment with this approach, but it would seem to align with the principle behind 'ju' and I am sure it is probably something a more 'traditionally' minded judoka may champion. Though of course, you can always throw right sided from a left handed grip, and vice versa. I think a more pragmatic approach would be to say that every judoka should have at least one 'wrong sided' technique in their arsenal. Then of course many techniques such as a lot of ashiwaza, I tend to think of as not really having a left or right 'side' and most judoka should be working on attacking either leg equally."

judo,30xst1,newhoza,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"I just had my first shiai too!, however my experience was completely different. There was only 4 competitors in my class and won my first match by shido. The other two I lost by ippon. The difference with your experience is that I noticed I was stronger than 2 of my opponents and about the same against the other one. On my first match, I was able to move him around and even scored a wazari, he went completely defensive (maybe because he was also tired) and i kept attacking, he got 4 shido by not attacking, the match lasted 4 minutes. The other 2 matches , I lost really fast, even tho I felt stronger, I just couldn't against their technique, they were far superior and that made me actually happy, I knew I was stronger but got beaten anyways because lack of skill/experience."

Watching judo and supporting your club/team is just part of the experience and will make you a better judoka and person.

judo,30w5tv,Ryvai,3,Tue Mar 31 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"Ude-gaeshi is just an unofficial name for a specific variation of yoko-wakare that is very popular. Same goes for the popular te-guruma, which is just a variation of sukui-nage. Kodokan does not recognize these unofficial names, but it's helpful to know them. Cause everyone who know's what ude-gaeshi is will immediately know what you're talking about :)"
judo,30w5tv,fleischlaberl,2,Tue Mar 31 22:25:00 2015 UTC,"It's ""ude"" and ""gaeshi"": ude is ""arm"" and always, if you see some ""ude"" in Judo names, there is something important going an with the arm. In ""yoko wakare"" 横分 (sideway/cross separate) the grip is a classic one = sleeve and lapel, in ""ude gaeshi"" (arm turn/back) you grip with the one hand from the lapel to the opposite arm (ude) of uke and throw him with a one sided double arm (ude) grip.  But its a very difficult throw anyway, if done correctly and not only drag down  and roll other somehow.  ."

judo,30s2n2,Spooky-Forest,7,Mon Mar 30 05:42:32 2015 UTC,"Making your arms stiff is a habit you need to break. It causes a few problems. First, you end up telegraphing what your going to do to your opponent. Second, you end up ""blocking"" yourself from entries into throws, or push your opponent away. Third, it gives you a false sense of security because you feel like your preventing your opponent from attacking you. Fourth, you tire yourself out for no good reason. There's plenty of other reasons why it's bad.  To break this, it's mainly a mental block you have to get past. You will end up holding yourself back in randori if you keep it up. When you relax your arms, you will be thrown around a fair bit at first, but you will learn to move into and out of throws more easily. You will also learn when it's appropriate to actually use the strength of your arms to move your opponent or ""block"" their attempts to throw or move you. Relax your arms, but keep your fists firmly gripped."
judo,30s2n2,silvaphysh13,3,Mon Mar 30 06:11:44 2015 UTC,"I agree completely with Spooky-Forest. My sensei will always say that if you're having trouble consciously relaxing, then go do 100 push ups, and see if you can still stiffen your arms."
judo,30s2n2,lostMartinet,2,Mon Mar 30 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"Stand so close to your opponent that you can't stiff arm. You'll feel insecure and like you're opening yourself up but if you are unable to just not do it, then this is a good way to force it.  Once you can do this then you can work on moving to whatever distance you like and just being cognisant of not locking your arms up. Again, you'll feel insecure but eventually you'll realise that it makes things easier in terms of not making your intentions extremely obvious and reacting to what your opponent does."
judo,30s2n2,microflops,1 point,Mon Mar 30 08:12:01 2015 UTC,"This is natural for a newbie. Best thing you can do is try and choose partners you trust in Randori. Tell them you are having issues with iron arms and keeping relaxed, and ask them to remind you to loosen up if you become too rigid.  Just watch out for the people who fight to win. Few guys I refuse to do randori with as they are so much fitter, more senior and knowledgeable and just love to win. I find these are usually the younger guys but they don't compete with a newbie or an oldy with an appropriate level of support. E.g. They just beat the crap out of you. I kid you not I saw a 1st Dan crack a 35ish year old guy with an extremely nasty co ouchi gari. He had no remorse.

After that I'll grapevine my legs and spread his out then I will force his head up and go for the rear naked choke.   That's my go-to move, sometimes we do drilling randori where we have to try to turn them over so I do other techniques but if it's just freestyle randori try that."
judo,30qhbu,fedornuthugger,2,Sun Mar 29 23:16:28 2015 UTC,This is what I do as well. I've had training partners do this to me and it just pisses me off. I make sure that have the joints of my hands and wrist dig into their neck as I fish for the RNC because I feel they need a painful reminder of why what they are doing is stupid. I know exactly what OP is talking about and I find it something disgraceful for a martial artist to do.

judo,30qhbu,TheSubGenius,2,Tue Mar 31 11:29:04 2015 UTC,Probably not as effective in judo since the ref will stand you back up but in bjj I like to push on their upper back/shoulders with all my weight to make breathing very difficult. When they start pushing on the ground to fight it I let go and choke them as their head springs up. Only takes a few seconds but in judo you don't always have that :/
judo,30qhbu,TheSubGenius,2,Mon Mar 30 04:29:09 2015 UTC,"If you can, ride his back and hook your left arm de into his right, at least up to the elbow ( or the other way around if you want). Grab his skirt and figure four your grip ( like for a key lock). Jump off towards the side your hooked and pull towards the head at a 45 degree angle whilst pushing to roll him. Works quite well and haven't seen it used much anywhere else."

If your best defense is to lay on your belly, I think you deserve a little bit of misery before you find a more effective way to protect yourself.

Good news for you is that relying on stalling tactics like that is a very good way to stagnate development in your game, so this particular case shouldn't give you trouble for too long before the turtle shell cracks.    In the meantime, I saw some good tips for lifting him and getting your hooks in.  If you do get your hooks in and he decides to belly out again, just arch your back and drive your hips into him.    If I'm picturing your problem right that should get him flattened out with his arms trapped under his chest because he was protecting both lapels.  From there hadaka-jime should be a breeze."

judo,30qhbu,pk618,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:52:27 2015 UTC,"We learned a really good attack on this the other day actually - I'll try and describe it as best as I can.  (Coming from the right side - swap 'left' and 'right' as appropriate).  Coming from the right side, get your right hand as deeply into his collar as you can (if he's guarding his collar with his hands, then make him pay for that by really grinding your hand against the underside of his jaw as you wriggle it in - that will at the very least give you some room for grip and make him suffer for a bit). With your grip on his collar, bring your left leg over him and plant your foot flat on the ground, knee up straight, foot right next to his arm. Bring your left hand over and either grab his left sleeve, or (even better if you can) wriggle your arm through his and take a hold of his lapel. Then, yank him up towards you. If you do it right, he should find himself trapped - he can't lie back down because your leg is holding him up, and he cant fall backwards because you're there. Keeping a tight grip with lots of control, tip back onto your side, so you end up in an almost spooning position (yes I know it sounds weird, but that's the best way I could think to describe it). Finally, hook your right leg inside his to get control, and reach your left hand under his arm through to take his right lapel. Now, you have control of his gi collar and his lapel, as well as his legs. You can now apply a strong okuri-eri-jime and tap him out.   NB: Make sure you roll onto your SIDE, and not flat onto your back with him on top of you. I was doing the latter at first, and you're then in danger of having him control you. Also, you can apply the choke a LOT tighter when you're on the side than when you're on your back (My sensei demonstrated this on me, and when you do the side approach it comes on almost straight away, trust me).   Hopefully I have explained this well enough - it DEFINITELY works and if you can pull it off hopefully this guy will stop resorting to boring unhelpful training tactics."

judo,30nhq1,NDNguitarguy,2,Mon Mar 30 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"TBH Your language here kind of proves /u/dave_attenburz's point. We live in a world where we're conscious of the effects that language can subtly have and make minority/disadvantaged groups feel. When you say, 'quit being a pussy' what you mean is obviously 'you're being overly sensitive/weak willed.' The use of slang terminology that refers to a feminine trait is not really fair; why should we perpetuate the usage of language designed to degrade a group for being different from the social ideal? It alienates a group and makes them feel unwelcome, creating an atmosphere where deviating from the 'norm' (in this case masculinity) is somehow bad [as evidenced by you conflating sensitivity with femininity, and insulting another user by calling them feminine.]  Similarly, when Osiander uses historically or currently homophobic language, or joking about the sex acts of a group whose sexuality has been the reason for their marginalisation, he risks perpetuating or normalizing the language or attitude, even if he holds no malice towards the group. In the context of martial arts or sports in general this becomes particularly dangerous; the environment already has an issue of acceptance of non-traditional straight, male groups. So what /u/dave_attenburz  is saying is not Kurt Ossiander is a mean, awful person, but actually that the language used by Kurt Ossiander is historically malicious and harmful to marginalized groups, and that he would expect a reasonable person in this day and age to be more sensitive to how you talk about these groups.

Is this correct? It seems to me that rotating uke's thumb to point down (in relation to uke's head/feet) would put the arm in a weaker position for an arm-bar because uke's elbow can naturally rotate to turn away from tori (and the fulcrum) the more the thumb is rotated that way, and this starts to put a little bend in uke's arm."

Yes, absolutely. Boxing and jiu-jitsu gave me a strength of conviction and mental fortitude, and I'm sure judo does as well (by the time I started judo, the transformation was complete). But whether the next person in your club will receive those benefits is completely unknown. Different people react differently to the same stimuli. Results are not guaranteed.   I do think 1v1 sports breed a toughness that's completely different from team sports, though. In team sports, there's almost always someone else to blame for failure.

judo,30m7ce,shackra,8,Sat Mar 28 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"Summed up very briefly, Kano postulated three goals for judo:  Being a martial art, a form of physical education and a pedagogy system.  Kano was pretty convinced, that judo had the potential to be more than a martial art. Here is an excerpt from the book ""Mind over Muscle"", a selection of texts by Kano:  https://books.google.de/books?id=7NUw4CLby9YC&pg=PA68&dq=%22In+one+respect,+moral+education%22&hl=de&sa=X&ei=kBAXVeaoAdfmauWOgpgO&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22In%20one%20respect%2C%20moral%20education%22&f=false  We have to face certain realities though. While Judo is or at least has the potential to be a effective martial art and regular, reasonable practice will make you physically fit, the moral development aspect is and has always been problematic. Even in Kano's days there were feuds, rivalty and judoka with a winning at all costs mentality.   Kano's work had great impact on marital arts, but I wonder if any student of pedagogics, who doesn't practice martial arts, has ever heard of him.  Judo seems to have the potential to instill good and bad characteristics that borderline each other: Self confidence and conceit, mutual respect and rivalty, diligence and exaggerated ambition. Maybe judo doesn't improve our character, but merely reveals it?"

I was in the process of leaving the military at the time, so that was what brought this questions relevance to me at that particular point in time.  He gave me some very memorable advice: It's important to remember its military background, and develop in that direction if that's your direction you're traveling in, and if you're traveling in the way of Sport, then develop in the direction of sport. And at times we change the roads we're on, and at times the roads come together to be the same road.   I hope one day to be as wise as my sensei."

It's a martial art with a progressive philosophy behind it that gives a framework for the students to become better individuals. However, the competition aspect and especially the IJF has no moral high ground over other combat sports or mma. The current rule set does not promote maximum efficiency or minimum effort. It promotes showmanship, taking bad break falls to stop points and it promotes giving your back to your opponent after a failed throw. This is not inline with the founding principles of Judo.   The founding principles of Judo often give way to the competition aspect of the martial art. Mutual benificience is usually the first one that gives way in a highly competitive environment."

There needs to be communication, feedback, and a sense of empathy, which are all unspoken aspects of randori, and to a lesser degree uchikomi/nagekomi (and kata).  To summarise, the mindfulness that one should bring to judo practice can very easily be extended to sharpening one's sense of morality, compassion, and empathy. In my experience, the least mindful practitioners tend also be people I don't particularly like."
judo,30m7ce,langoustine,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Saying judo is a martial art means it originates as a way to train soldiers (ju-jiutsu, which was simplified to yield judo, does), not that it bears some sort of higher philosophy. Now, don't get me wrong, it obviously has all the moral improvement capabilities of similar sports, e.g. wreslting. But that's pretty much it. In Japan, because of the (possibly religious -- in an east-asian way) symbolism or culture or what have you, it might be different. But I'm not Japanese. Nor east Asian, for that matter. Open mindedness is cool and all, but I'm not getting my way of life from some relatively modern sport in a country ten thousands miles away from home; there's plenty of wisdom already -- right on my doorstep.  And it's not me wanting to stir people up. I mean, I look up to that mustachioed dude when it comes to throwing people around, not so when it comes to how I should behave : the only thing I got from the whole 'ethic' was basically friendship and humility. Well no offence, but that's not very original.  So yeah. Judo : good for throwing the baddies around, good for your health, probably good for learning sport ethics - not much for dictating behavior. Imho"
judo,30m7ce,Ginzly,2,Sat Mar 28 22:48:52 2015 UTC,"It's overly ambitious to believe that Judo can change all the ills of mankind or is the end all be all of moral dogma.   However, mutual benefit (jita kyoei) is an important and significant principle of Judo even within the context of training judo. This is something that the founder of Judo emphasized and that is unique compared to other martial arts. Do you think Tyson's training partners got much out of training with him?  Compared to what a nationally ranked judoka would get from training with Iliadis or Kayla Harrison? This is what I love about Judo. Judoka are super conscientious about sacrificing their time and body for your benefit.   Kano was asserting that if people applied such principles/behavior in other aspects of social interactions, the society would benefit. Kano wasn't trying to teach you how to serve God, reach eternal salvation, or claiming that he invented humility, friendship or leverage."
judo,30m7ce,H2Outbreak,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:52:22 2015 UTC,"I mean this is something in my opinion is also done in BJJ, but the topic comes up quite often from Judoka about BJJ and MMA practitioners being morally apprehensible. I also know not all Judoka learned this sort of behavior. I know Hector Lombard is known for beating the crap out of his training partners. So while the art, and probably all grappling arts, believe in mutual benefit because they can be sparred safely, it certainly doesn't bestow that mindset or virtue to it's practitioners."

Still, that's imho far from groundbreaking... or are you telling me the ideal of mutual benefit was unheard of before judo, or outside Japan?  Also, saying top notch judokas go out of their way to practice with their sparring partners in a way that is less than optimal just for their partners' sake is as preposterous as saying the same thing of Tyson."
judo,30m7ce,Ginzly,2,Sun Mar 29 10:08:13 2015 UTC,"it's not that it's unheard of, it's that no other martial art, as far as I know, explicititely makes mutual beneficience part of its founding core values."

judo,30lxbr,H2Outbreak,5,Sat Mar 28 16:07:10 2015 UTC,I think that this very thought was the moment that all of judo turned around for me.... I began watching a lot of Russian and Georgian fighters and started adopting a lot of my techniques from a right grip to a left throw... For example I basically throw this: http://youtu.be/v5nLpP_TUV8 very deep seionage as a lefty throw or turn it into a deep single leg ogoshi if I get a back grip... The great thing about these is that I let my opponents get a high collar grip so they come forward then throw with these... They never see it coming... And when they finally catch on I do a kosoto... :)  that al being said it took years of getting my left side throws any where near my right side but it was well worth it!!

My dojo did a left-hand seionage from a right-hand grip, with a normal left-hand entry; you get good pull from the lapel, but you have to continue the pull much further than you may be used to.  You will still clip uke's left arm with your left arm in this variation.  Tai otoshi feels like it could be more difficult to do with this reverse grip, as you have to lead further out.  On the other hand, it could just be a ""practice practice practice"" issue to acclimate how far out you maintain the pull."
judo,30lxbr,pk618,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:15:12 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy to hit ledt uchi mata with a right grip. Get a high sleeve/armpit grip with your left and keep your collar grip. Take a turning step with your right leg and steering wheel with your hands to that side. That should create the correct kuzushi situation that you can fit in and reap with your left leg. It tends to be a ""leg style"" uchi mata but it's quick and unexpected because it's an abbreviated turn and a left throw off right grips.  It also works off double lapel grips."

The only times my back hurt after a throw was when I did something wrong or cooled down too much before we started throwing.  Maybe something is off about your technique? Without seeing we can't be sure though. Could you film and post it?

judo,30l8cm,judokalinker,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:00:07 2015 UTC,This is exactly what happened to me when I started judo. You are definitely using your lower back and trying to just power him over top.
judo,30l8cm,H2Outbreak,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's from seoi nage?   I had a fairly strenuous randori session last night and my right side lower back is pretty toasty today. For me, I think it's from resisting/defending throws more than attempting seoi nage. My spinal extensors are fried from trying the straighten my back and stand upright when partner attempts a throw without much kuzushi."
judo,30l8cm,pk618,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"My best guess is you need to drop your level more. When I see people tying to stand upright and torque someone over it inevitably creates a bowed lower back which is an injury waiting to happen.  Also make sure you are rotating your shoulders and not trying to ""bow"" them over. A nice que for this is to watch your uke's feet through the whole throw.  This will force you to turn your head and shoulders and give both more power to your turn as well as a nicer landing for uke (especially if your non-sleeve hand is controlling the shoulder of uke like it should be)."
judo,30l8cm,PartyPope,1 point,Sun Mar 29 10:19:43 2015 UTC,Common/10  Strenghten your core especially lower back. Also you should try to get a better timing and pull because the back pain only happens when you muscle through as I would call it.
judo,30l8cm,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:41:41 2015 UTC,"That sounds really off. In seo nage you should be loading uke onto your hips, and then raising the hips, the upper body is used to pull forwards rather than lift.  Even when I'm practising seo with someone close to twice my weight (I'm 81kg) my knees hurt not my back."
judo,30l8cm,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sat Mar 28 13:30:30 2015 UTC,"my knees hurt   Do you know...   In seo nage you should be loading uke onto your hips, and then raising the hips,   ... if you are doing this correctly?  Don't try to lift uke up. Topple him over you,  using your back as tilting platform. Your lowered hips should push back and up in a quarter circle while your arms pull him forward. Uke is basically rotated around his center of mass like a figure on a foosball table.  Look how Hiroshi Katanishi explains and demonstrates it here:  https://youtu.be/bievkFxqP4o?t=7m39s"
judo,30l8cm,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:19:08 2015 UTC,"I think so. I mean I'd need 40 extra years of judo training before my seo nage looks like that, but I'm happy that I have the basic movement down.  The fact that you connect with uke with your hips so close to the centre of mass pretty much guarantees that as you raise your hips, you also raise uke, even if it's only by an inch."
judo,30l8cm,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"with your hips so close to the centre of mass   They shouldn't be, but well below. Take a look at this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4B6K0orRXg"
judo,30l8cm,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Sat Mar 28 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"That's because there is around 2 foot in height difference.  You need to make contact with the torso and because the centre of gravity is roughly inline with the belt, you must contact near the centre of gravity. This is clear in the bit with the skeletons, because the girl is so much shorter, you can see the guy's groin collides with her upper back, and bends the spine.  Basically, I'm going to keep trying to do seo nage like 6:30 in the first video, and not like I'm a tiny Japanese girl fighting a giant.  Edit: obviously there are advantages to going lower in seo nage, but that video is completely misleading. The main advantage is that it is much easier to bring them over the top of you, rather than turning them from the bottom as the film claims."

It could be a number of reasons, but its likely the result of one or more poor breakfalls; it could be a factor of being thrown in a way your not used to, thrown too hard, or just improper breakfalling.  All that being said, it could be whiplash or a concussion. See a doctor."
judo,30krat,Spooky-Forest,1 point,Sat Mar 28 06:38:07 2015 UTC,Ok I think I will. I was in a practice session on Thursday with a guy who was definitely throwing me too hard. This guy was a bit over excited and was throwing me with (probably) poor technique and too much power. I can see in hindsight I should have said something but I didn't think that I could get hurt since I felt like I was break-falling properly.
judo,30krat,dave_attenburz,1 point,Sat Mar 28 07:31:23 2015 UTC,In general how you fall is your own responsibility. If your partner is having too think about your landing there's more chance of him fucking something up and really hurting you.
judo,30krat,LeiLoons,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed with this. I'm a beginner (only been learning for a few months), but I had headaches following practice that lasted for days. I was told that my fall technique was sloppy, i was flopping onto the floor rather than tucking my chin. I finally understood when I was told to try to make like a roly-poly when I fell. Once I bettered my falls, the headaches subsided. Thankfully for me they werent concussions"
judo,30krat,Paladin_PDX,1 point,Sat Mar 28 11:47:52 2015 UTC,"tuck your chin, hard.

judo,30kr4x,Dillinjer882,3,Sat Mar 28 05:53:36 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying you should always see a doctor for any heavy-contact sport injury, even if it seems very minor. I have had a similar jaw experience, however.  If you think your going to be fine, then sleep on it and see if you feel better tomorrow. If you don't, then go see a doctor.  When I was younger, I was playing jackpot with some friends and a football. Me and a friend were running full tilt for the ball from opposite directions, while looking up at the ball in the sky. We collided and my jaw hit the side of his head quite hard. Afterwards, my jaw felt misaligned, and I could not close my jaws. I went to the doctor and he told me I was fine and that the muscles would pull it back in place within 24 hours, and they did."
judo,30kr4x,Spooky-Forest,1 point,Sat Mar 28 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm assuming that will be the case because I have had a similar instance where a friend had me in a crossface and I only tapped when I heard my jaw start to seperate. Even with that, I couldn't close my jaw for a few days, but this time and in that case it's probably a swollen muscle."

I had a broken lip once as a result of a similar situation. I was throwing a yellow belt with a ken ken ouchigari, and right as he lost his balance he attempted to turn it into a tomoe nage, hitting my face with his knee."

Good throws to win against really tall and heavy competitors are the small reaps like ko soto gari and ko uchi gari.

In the clip you can see how he checks the giant's attacks by gripping his pants.  When a guy has legs that long, and doesn't have to worry about you grabbing them, he can just use his superior range to apply any ashiwaza or attack with a leg style uchimata."

On the other hand if he's big and has a lot of BJJ experience already they may be thrilled to have him want to train with them.  Who knows?

judo,3098cl,8872999714,6,Thu Mar 26 05:47:50 2015 UTC,"But that's not how income tax works...  Edit for the sake of clarification: with the way income tax works in the US (and in most other places), being in a higher tax bracket doesn't mean you pay the extra rate on ALL your income - just the portion that's in that tax bracket. So it doesn't matter how much you're making in income and whether charitable donations are tax deductible; if you're donating money to some charitable cause, you're losing some amount of money.  If that donation is 100% deductible and the entire amount is in a 50% tax bracket, then you're only really losing out on half the money (because 50% would have gone to the taxman anyway), but you're still losing money."

Making a complete 5-month plan, that fits you, is almost impossible without more information and takes some time to do. A short version would be;   Maintain a decent shape, how you do that is up to you. Take all that Judo knowledge you already have and systemize it to fit your national/local exam syllabus for shodan. That might mean that you have to change some details of your techniques, fine tune some of the details or even just explain why yours deviate from the standard curriculum. Write down, on paper, systematically how your grading would look like. e.g. start by demonstrating ne-waza, which techniques and in which order for example. This also helps you to memorize it and identify what you need to practice more to get right. If the sensei asks for certain techniques to demonstrate it, at least you have a mental shelf to place that technique. In many cases people struggle most with the kata. Start studying it immediatly and find good partner to practice with that wants the same as you. Most of all, have fun! 36 years is long overdue, look at it an achievement for all those hours spent on the mat.

Make sure you are solid on all of the specific requirements.  You also need to be solid on everything required for ranks below shodan as well.  You are supposed to be improving everything as you study, not just doing things once and leaving them behind. Practice your nage no kata. As many times as you can, both uke and tori.  Perhaps set a goal of doing the kata at least 50 times in the 5 months you have Polish up your reigi (etiquette).  Make sure your bow is up to standards(bow, don't bend) and that you can kneel into seiza and get up without looking like a dirty laundry landslide. Review your terminology. remember written Japanese is pronounced more or less like Spanish. Buy a new Judogi in time for the examination.  You probably need one anyway.  Show up in a bright white freshly launderd gi. It does not have to be brand new but should be in good repair, not raggedy, and fit properly You seem to be worried about physical conditioning.  It is always good to have a motiviation to get in better shape.  However, if you work on all the things listed, plus throw in some regular cardio like running, cycling, etc. and maybe some light resistance training.  Usually the only physically chanllenging part of the examination are test matches, or a ""slaughter line"" (facing 4-5 brown belts in a row).  Given your age, I do not think they will ask this of you. As an older Judoka of great experience your greatest strength will be technical knowledge and understanding of Judo.  No 58 year old is still a great fighter.  Polish up what you know and fill in any gaps.

I have been doing judo on and off for over 10 years at multiple different clubs, and one of the main reasons it has been on and off is because I get incredibly nervous before each class. I get so nervous to the point of almost throwing up and thinking of any excuse to bail. Because of this my progression has suffered greatly (it took me 6-7 years to get a yellow belt from a school that only graded off of tournaments and I am only now orange). I love doing judo and talking about it, and when I haven't been in a while I have dreams about it. I would even love to make shodan and open my own club one day. I have been going pretty consistently recently, but still avoiding ""randori"" Sundays. Does anyone have similar experiences or advice? Thanks."

In that case practicing ukemi would be very important (and doing it right: exhaling, slapping the mat, tucking in your head, etc.. ).  Are you afraid of losing? In that case remember this: Randori has no winners or losers. It is just practice. If pride is a problem for you, well... leave it at the door.  Are you afraid of performing badly? Again: Leave your pride at the door.  If you go to training regularly, you already defeated the hardest opponent there is: Yourself.

I've never really thought about it before. Regular practice like uchikomi does not make me nervous. Randori makes me very nervous. The idea of failing in front of everyone isn't a good one, but I am not completely sure why. I am not a very prideful or aggressive person and I really don't like confrontation."

First it has a lot to do with much too high expectations and second with getting judged by others. The feeling that everybody is looking on you doesn't represent reality. You are building your own prison. As Geschichtenerzaehler (story teller) said, randori is free practice and has no winners or losers. Its just practice.   One thing you can try is focus on your breath. Breathing deep and constant can give you some deflection for your thoughts and emotions. Breathing deep - short inhalation and looong exhalation - gives you also a good rooting in randori and lowers your COG. Empty your thoughts and enjoy the practice. I know that this is easy said and difficult to do BUT if you can focus on the presence its a big gift not only for randori but also for life.  ."

From what I understand, the uki should be tipping over and pulled down to execute the kake. This is more like Uki Goshi without the hand behind the back."

judo,3085jo,sawskankredemption,2,Thu Mar 26 00:46:14 2015 UTC,One counter we've been taught several times is to step over tori's leg and turn into a kosoto gari or kosoto gake. This is the general idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdlE_vbVRUs

This can be a good way to make space for an escape, or to get them into sankaku-jime.   Kami-shiho-gatam: Change the angle of your body so that you and your opponent resemble a ""V"" rather than an ""I"", then, grabbing the back of their gi with both hands, do a bench-press motion combined with a bridge, then drop, and roll into the V at the same time.   These are just the two that came to mind off the top of my head, I can come up with a couple more, if you'd like."

judo,307uft,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Wed Mar 25 06:33:11 2015 UTC,"And the competition rules, especially those related to prohibited and dangerous acts. And also the etiquette of Judo; don't yell at the judge, don't make rude gestures, etc. This would portray the club badly."

judo,307uft,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Wed Mar 25 10:19:46 2015 UTC,"That's a really odd question, why would someone without any grappling experience enter shiai?   Outside of being a beginner in judo... no wrestling or any other non-judo background.  How does a beginner in judo know he is ready? Skill wise? Hitting 100 throws in randori, being able to throw in 2, 4, or X directions, 10,000 uchikomis for each throw, at least 100 hours of class time, mere personal desire?  When would you say, ""you're ready"" or not."
judo,307uft,fleischlaberl,3,Wed Mar 25 12:51:47 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Judoka should start shiai from early on, if they learned ukemi, a few throws, some pins and the rules of competition. There is no reason to give competition an extra high status. As you know, it means ""test/proof together"" and this is what even yellow belts can do. Its also important to get used to the emotions of competition and this you only can learn in shiai, cause a lot of ego is involved in terms of wishing, wanting, fearing, dreaming  etc.   ."
judo,307uft,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely. Think of shiai as just another tool to help improve your judo. I imagine it kind of like doing a scrimmage game in basketball. It's not critical who wins, but rather that you're simulating using your skills against opponents who know what they're doing. Even if you lose every match, it'll give you food for thought and new goals to work towards."
judo,307uft,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:30:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see.... well you are always ready to gain experience, ready to win... that's a different kind of matter.

judo,307uft,Mountainous-Bear,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:46:13 2015 UTC,I did my first competition about 1 month after starting as a complete novice. It was a great experience as I won a few lost a few but learnt a lot about actual competition. It was especially good because as a heavyweight I don't get any real practice with people my size so a tournament was the perfect way to fight a few heavyweights.
judo,307uft,pk618,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"If your instructors think you are ok to compete, go for it. Your ukemi should be to a certain level and you should have a throw or two that you feel comfortable with but everyone reaches those things at different speeds."

judo,306082,bull_in_chinashop,2,Wed Mar 25 02:14:25 2015 UTC,why do judo discussion always degenerate into discussions about nomenclature and manners. I swear most judokas I meet know a lot of Japanese and very little judo.
judo,306082,Brian175,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:44:33 2015 UTC,"The nomenclature defines the mechanics of the throw. So in discussing the mechanics of why it worked, you basically have determined it's nomenclature. They go hand and hand."
judo,306082,fedornuthugger,3,Wed Mar 25 05:09:09 2015 UTC,"the nomenclature usually translates to gems like ""1 point shoulder throw"". They don't define the mechanics they are basic Japanese terms. Memorizing words doesn't help with actual randori."
judo,306082,Brian175,3,Wed Mar 25 05:14:44 2015 UTC,They help in discussions with other judoka about technique. That's about it.
judo,306082,02-6611-0142-1,0,Wed Mar 25 13:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah they do. For example the difference between a seoi-nage and a seoi-otoshi despite looking similar is in the mechanics of what makes the throw work. The other day someone asked what a throw was and even though it appeared to be a harai goshi, and probably started out as one, it was actually an osoto gari. The outer leg reap was the mechanics of the throw rather than a sweeping hip motion."
judo,306082,Brian175,2,Wed Mar 25 05:19:08 2015 UTC,"The mechanics of seoi nage would be three or four paragraphs of writing describing each of the working parts of the throw and how they interact with one another to reach a desired outcome, with a lengthy description of the exact motion and purpose of each section of each limb, and what effect it produces in each section of each limb in the body of your opponent. ""Seoi Nage"" is just a title, a shorthand description."
judo,306082,SVPPB,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:43:13 2015 UTC,"Of course if you wanted a detail breakdown. The 'drop' in seoi otoshi is the key element that makes the throw work. You can vary or do other parts of the technique wrong, but if you don't drop it's not a seoi otoshi."
judo,306082,user079,-1,Wed Mar 25 12:42:09 2015 UTC,that's what i'm saying... the nomenclature isn't important
judo,306082,Brian175,3,Wed Mar 25 06:45:06 2015 UTC,"Can you demonstrate that throw were you kind of like turn your back to your opponent and then while half of your chest is in contact with your opponents chest and his balance is on his front right foot, you sweep with your right leg above his knee?"
judo,306082,Brian175,1 point,Wed Mar 25 07:55:36 2015 UTC,"You mean, like you lift and pull on uke, and then you sort of prop your leg in front of his ankle so he trips over it?   If only throws had highly descriptive names that allowed us to understand their mechanics!  Edit: Now I understand! You mean the one where you load him over your back and then sweep his legs. Maybe we should name it ""sweeping hip throw"" or something like that..."
judo,306082,OnceNFutureNick,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"I am not really following you there… I am talking about the throw where you kind of step in with your right foot, step behind the right foot with your left, put the weight on the left foot and while you are pulling him forward and making chest contact, you kind of pivot slightly and then finally the right foot comes forward and then sweeps back at his standing leg and he goes flying in a beautiful arch. Any of this sound familiar to you?  Oh, I wish there were like simple names for these things, a nomenclature.  ""sweeping hip throw"", eh? Is that what it is? I like that, it has a certain ring to it. Maybe we could give it a japanese name? You know, because of reasons."
judo,306082,iamchase,3,Thu Mar 26 07:17:02 2015 UTC,Actually it helps a lot of people to understand what to do when learning a new throw. Suppose I know seoi nage and tai otoshi. Now I'm told of seio otoshi. I already know what the two separate parts of the name mean so already have a good grasp of what the throw will be like. Most bits of throw names in judo are interchangeable like this and actually help make learning easier once you know what they describe.
judo,306082,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Mar 25 08:05:14 2015 UTC,"Does knowing the term ""jump shot"" or ""fade away jump shot"" help you play basketball? Judo they obsess over names rather than just doing judo."
judo,306082,mrpopenfresh,2,Wed Mar 25 05:52:36 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we go through lengthy discussions of what a technique is in BJJ too. They are just usually related to passes and maybe escapes. The right nomenclature isn't something regulated to Judo. Also you made an analogy to a game that has very few techniques versus a martial art that may have hundreds of techniques and variations.
judo,306082,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Wed Mar 25 12:40:37 2015 UTC,maybe on reddit people go into lengthy discussions about the names of BJJ techniques. In BJJ gyms they don't.

If I said ""do-osae"", or ""juji gatame"" most people would have no clue what I meant. They have all these moves that Maeda didn't teach to the Gracies, and some guy 'discovered' it, and they name it after him. Some of them actually call a gi top a 'kimono'."
judo,306082,KarateCowboy,8,Wed Mar 25 00:58:04 2015 UTC,"They have all these moves that Maeda didn't teach to the Gracies, and some guy 'discovered' it, and they name it after him.   I dont think that is a fair characterization.   To start, Judo is huge in Brazil and the Gracies often competed in Judo tournaments and did well.  They were certainly exposed to Judo and Judo terminology.  The judo technique names are for the most part descriptive and hold no particular special significance.  Other countries making direct translations to their native languages is hardly anger-inducing.    Moreover, while the end point (the submission) may have existed, you cannot deny the innovation bjj has made relative to set ups, technique strings, or the various guard systems.  BJJ has a meta game all it's own and has made leaps and strides independent of judo.  Not only that, but naming a key lock the Kimura after a famous victory is the same as Ali's strategy being immortalized as the Rope A Dope.  That is just what happens when famous people do famous things.    As for not bowing or other forms of respect: for one, many bjj guys bow all the time.  For another, bowing has cultural significance in Japan, but not in the Americas or Europe.  IMO, shaking hands, bumping fists, or a hug after the match is the exact same thing as bowing in our cultural context, exchange of respect.    Edit: grammar."
judo,306082,Brian175,3,Wed Mar 25 02:32:11 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more.  Especially in regards to the bowing thing.  My Judo coach is from japan and would tell us to NOT shake hands after a Judo match.  He says ""You already bow.  Why shake hands?? Same thing.  Why do again??"""
judo,306082,derioderio,-1,Wed Mar 25 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's not quite the same thing, in that a handshake after a bow is like adding blue to black"

judo,306082,KarateCowboy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe most interesting in a japanese/judoist perspective is the japanese colour aesthetic.   ""Black"" traditionally has meanings of death, misfortune, fear and sorrow but also is a colour of formal.  ""Blue"" as the colour of Water has the meaning of calmness and stability and as a watercolour represents more the feminine (yin) - in opposite (correct term would be ""polarity"", cause they interfere, blend, change etc.) to fire/red/man (yang).  Why the ""black belt""? I don't really know ... Some say, it has a buddhist context, that black is representing the ""emptiness"". Even you mastered ""some Judo"" as a shodan, there is a long road to understand judo on an advanced level and there is still a lot to learn even if you are a godan.  ."

It is true that the Japanese names are descriptive; latin biological and scientific names are descriptive, but we don't teach our kids about the tyrant lizard king, deceptive reptile, and roof lizard.   The nice thing about bowing is that it is a very deep sign of respect. The handshake shows friendship because the hand holds no weapon. The bow shows graciousness and honorability. Respect is extra important in the ju-arts because if you respect your opponent or uke then you won't hurt him.   ED: In the spirit of the discussion, I wanted to add that your user name is cool, but it's Japanese alternative, ""Shoryuken"" would be even cooler. Very apropos."

judo,30549o,Geschichtenerzaehler,5,Tue Mar 24 22:48:19 2015 UTC,"There are a few things you need to know. Sorry if you already do, but here they are:   There is actually no lifting in most throws. Instead you are supposed to tilt them over you. Look what Hiroshi Katanishi does here: https://youtu.be/bievkFxqP4o?t=8m39s He doesn't lift. Instead his hips push back while he pulls uke forward. As a consquence of this, you don't have to be very powerful in your legs and you can drop really deep without being afraid of collapsing under the opponents weight. How to get that deep and especially quickly? The quickest way to squat down is to ""take both feet of the ground simultanously"". ""Fall"" into the squat, don't ""push"" yourself down into it. This works best when you jump into the squat position, or at least begin to lower your hips while you step into position. Don't turn first and lower yourself afterwards. To be able to position yourself properly, you need space. Don't step too close for Seoi Nage and its variants. Pull Uke onto you after you turned. He'll fall easily over you, if you accompany this with the hip push/arm pull mentioned above. To get better at this, practice 180° turns. Quick jump turns where your feet slide just above the ground. Begin standing, jump and turn, end squatting, back upright, but without losing your balance to the back."

judo,30549o,OceanRacoon,2,Tue Mar 24 22:48:40 2015 UTC,"""Seoi Nage"" means lit. ""to carry on one's back and throw"".  To classify Seoi as a ""shoulder throw"" is somehow misleading ...

There should be almost no sound. This gives you good balance. I think it was Katanishi who demonstrates this, I can't quite remember."
judo,30549o,Merciless1,2,Wed Mar 25 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"Lunges help a lot, in my opinion. At least where I train we say after kuzushi comes the level change meaning your first step into the throw should be when you bend your knees and change level. You shouldn't come up from that lowered position until you execute the throw. You shouldn't generally be bending at the waist to lower yourself, only during the throw (and even then it's less than many beginners think)."

I step in like I'm going for a regular Harai, but then as my opponent moves to block, I switch to a left-side harai attack WITHOUT changing my grips.  I often hit this in MMA as my opponent (often a wrestler) digs in deep for a strong underhook on my left-side. I trap the arm, clamp down on his left-tricep and rip the left-handed harai.  I'm probably somewhere around an 85% success rate on this one attack and fully expect the IJF to ban it soon."

I think 7-6 is about as early as practical, although I know many clubs (including my own) take young kids all the time. I'm not against it on any other grounds that it doesn't really help them at all. It's for the parents.  Toddlers should toddle, not do combat sports."
judo,3004bc,skytomorrownow,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"This is the typical approach, and it's not without reasoning, however there are important issues that most do not address here. I attended a judo-seminar in Italy last summer. In an between-sessions event one of the senior Judoka held a lecture on 'children and Judo'. I don't remember his education but it was related to either psychology or neuroscience, or even both, I don't remember. His lecture was about his research related to physical and psychological development in children doing sports. Since he is a Judoka himself Judo was obviously part of it. What he discussed was how children develop from a very early age and what contributes to that growth. He made some amazing points on how good Judo can be for children psychologically and physically. Fine, they don't learn that much 'Judo' in itself, it's more what Judo can offer the children in terms of coordination challenges and how neuro-synapses form in response to this. I don't have my notes right here, but I was absolutely convinced that Judo contributes positively to their development. The test subjects in his tests trained Judo, very basic of-course with play an physical challenges, performed significantly better in school and developed sosial-networks faster, compared to the control-groups that either did not partake in any sports or did ball-sports like football."
judo,3004bc,OceanRacoon,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"What you are describing sounds great, but, I just feel since that begins to be somewhat remote from what we are supposed to be doing in judo, I feel it should be kept separate.  For example, my old club used to have a 'baby judo' class. This was really more about tumbling and learning basic body skills than anything -- developmental, as you describe, and not a lot of actual judo going on, other than the wearing of gi. I thought that was appropriate and prepared the children well for when they actually joined judo. The number one goal of baby judo was to get them tumbling and learn ukemi, but in a 'play' format.  So, I'm not religious about it at all. I am fine with tots on the tatami. What I do think is ridiculous though, is shiai for toddlers."

judo,2zymvg,sawskankredemption,6,Mon Mar 23 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but personally, aggression fucks me up. I wear myself out trying to tear the other guy down. I try to keep a calm, methodical state of mind. That way, aggression and defensiveness are tools to employ rather than a style I'm committed to. If the guy's exposing himself, play defensive and look for the counter. If the guy doesn't react well to pressure, turn it up.  How much does your dad know about judo? Because from the sidelines, getting handled can look like ""not being aggressive enough"" when in reality your opponent isn't giving you any opportunities to score. Take his advice with a grain of salt."

If you feel you slipping and your opponent is gaining momentum try to stop and continue fighting your fight. Does that make sense?  I've always been taught to not let the opponent get comfortable, once you have your grips attack. Obviously do not recklessly but you know what I'm saying."

judo,2zwoi1,Geschichtenerzaehler,5,Sun Mar 22 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"I have almost 2 dozen judo books I guess. If I learned something from reading them, then it's that teaching judo with words is even more difficult than teaching it on the mats, and that few people are able to express the full concept and necessary details of a technique.  Most books are written by senior judoka, who sometimes omit important details they deem obvious. Others focus on the most ""basic"" form only and describe something that may be helpful to start with, but never go beyond that to something actually applicable.  Another problem is the lack of setups in many books. They tell you how the throw works, but not how to get there.  Another problem is the question of ""How much?"", as in how close, how far etc..   Last but not least, there is the problem of emphasis. A single word in a long descriptive sentence may have big importance or not. When a judo book says about O Goshi:""straighten your knees and push back and up with your hips..."" people may overlook the ""back"" part.  Don't get me wrong: I like good judo books. They can be hard to identify and even harder to read for a beginner, though. Also judo techniques are so complex, that a single source will often not be enough to fully grasp them. What I am trying to say is: If you want to learn a throw properly, use all available sources. All books you can get,  all videos you can watch, all instructors you can ask and especially do all the practice and experimenting you can do."

""Judo through the looking glass"" is a great read as well: Collected antecdotes about judo and biographical memories by a british senior judoka.  There's also John Steven's book about Kano and his students. But, while interesting to read, there seem to be some factual errors in it. Some legends were included without actual fact check.  Horst Wolf's books are great, based on Kawaishi's judo though. That's why some of the names and techniques in them are not Kodokan standard. One also gotta skip the GDR propaganda at the beginning."

One of the best books about old chinese philosophy by Ralf Moritz does the same. I enjoyed reading the Pyjama Game and re-read it from time to time - a lot of passion for Judo very well and funny written.   The best historical overview for Judo with some philosophical background I found, is the paper by wdax. What I don't have is the dissertation from Niehaus but interesting as literature for budo is ""Der gemeinsame Weg von Schwert und Pinsel"" by Julian Brown and the Classic ""The unfettered Mind"". I dont think that Judo is rooted in Zen. I see strong roots in Neoconfucianism (learning, selfperfection, moral and social education, contributing to society, peace and harmony) and in Daoism ( ju no ri and seiryoku zenyo, which both are rooted in simplicity and naturalness and a calm and clear mind - core values of Daoism).  ."

But if a judoka wanted to learn groundwork, I wouldn't toss him my copy and say ""here, this will help."" The book is designed to be read, digested, and played with/tinkered on through drilling and live rolling. Most judoka don't get the opportunity to roll, so as great as the book is, it would be useless to them. If, however, they had access to mats and willing partners, I'd say they could learn a thing from the text. They'll learn less than what they would from a live instructor, but hey, they'll learn something.   I don't own this book, but the same applies. If you don't have partners willing to drill with you and roll from standing, give it up and pull guard. If you do, study the book as best you can and augment it with YouTube videos.

judo,2zv8lz,emperor1509,2,Sun Mar 22 11:24:47 2015 UTC,With these compilation videos/highlight reels they always only show the 'spectacular' ippons. Many people (non-judokas) wouldn't find a 20 second hold or a barely visible strangulation any thrilling to watch.
judo,2zul3p,duchessHS,21,Sat Mar 21 22:38:14 2015 UTC,"I've got some theories about Rousey's dominance, specifically. I know more about her than about Ishii (mostly from Reddit chatter), and I think it's helpful to look at which of her advantages come from Judo and which don't.  Rousey's advantages that aren't tied to Judo (and other considerations):   Rousey's just got more years on the mat than most of her competition. Her mother was a serious competitor and trained Ronda from a young age. One thing Rousey's been praised for is adapting her Judo to MMA. Grips are different, obviously. She blends strikes into grappling in a way she certainly didn't learn from Judo. Rousey's style of Judo was focused on groundwork, and because of that it carries over to MMA better than a style based on throwing for ippon would.   But here are two places I think Judo serves her especially well:   It's not BJJ or wrestling, the two prevailing grappling styles in MMA. A Judoka approaches the ground game differently than other people. Done right, it's intensity can catch Jitsuieros off guard. I imagine wrestlers are less used to watching for submissions. I have a personal theory that Ronda Rousey displays an ippon-based gameplan. She approaches her fights like Judo matches. She is not interested in wearing her opponents down and slowly developing a dominant position--she is looking to end the fight as soon as there's an opportunity, starting at the bell. I think that focus on an immediate endgame is something you get from Judo. BJJ, by contrast, is more okay with developing slowly and making incremental improvements."
judo,2zul3p,war_lobster,2,Sat Mar 21 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"Also I think the difference, apart from her competition being mostly dogshit, is that it's a lot harder to throw a strong and heavy man without a gi who is punching you than it is to throw a 135lb woman who's been training for a handful of years, Sara McMann's embarrassing performance not withstanding.  I think that's the main reason you don't see judo utilised too much in men's MMA, OP, you have to be preposterously good at it to adjust it for MMA and then pull it off against a guy during a sweaty fight. The guys who might be good enough to do it are still winning medals in judo, but even then, who knows if they could pick up the striking or have the stomach for an MMA fight"
judo,2zul3p,OceanRacoon,49,Sun Mar 22 15:07:47 2015 UTC,You all have been reported and banned by the IJF for discussing MMA.
judo,2zul3p,Kung_Fu_Cowboy,14,Sun Mar 22 00:38:50 2015 UTC,MMA allows striking and it makes judo moves more difficult to pull off. Stances that are perfectly acceptable in judo will get you punched a lot in MMA. Also it is very very very hard to focus on doing a proper executed judo move when you are trying to keep your head on straight. People who can pull off amazing throws or trips while avoiding strikes and throwing their own strikes back are experts who have trained a lot.  Source: amateur MMA fighter for 6 years
judo,2zul3p,Chimneychong,13,Sat Mar 21 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"Additionally, the differences in striking power/ability between women's 135 (Rousey's weightclass) and men's 240 (Crocop's) allow Rousey to pull off techniques and eat shots that would be close to impossible against heavier or more skilled opponents."
judo,2zul3p,dissidentscrumartist,2,Sat Mar 21 23:35:51 2015 UTC,"I get that it's tough to pull off stuff like ippon zeoi and stuff that relies on a sleeve or lapel grip, but don't moves like hip throws flow pretty seamlessly into MMA? I think what's confusing me is that I don't see as many of those sorts of throws as often as I expect (Ronda being the exception.) Granted, I'm not exactly an MMA geek, so maybe I'm just not paying enough attention. But, I see fighters like Ishii and he just trades strikes or Aoki Shinya who tends to shoot for singles if I'm not mistaken. Seems like judo isn't being utilized properly by the majority of fighters, but that's just me."
judo,2zul3p,Hesperus,7,Mon Mar 23 00:12:15 2015 UTC,Why are some (anything) so good at MMA while others seem more average?
judo,2zul3p,Anthony126517,5,Sun Mar 22 02:14:31 2015 UTC,"In terms of Grappling. The main problem for Judo is the Gi, 80% of moves are in the Gi and unlike BJJ if you don't train No-Gi your gonna to have a hard time with grips and how easy it is to get out of things. Gi & No-Gi BJJ for example are two different games, this also applies to Judo. Judo can be done without a Gi but you have to train no-Gi to understand how to use it and most clubs don't. In terms of MMA the striking stance would be a huge problem if you turn your back you will get knocked out. That's why Wrestlers have the best base for MMA shoot from the in/outside and it's got the stand up covered. Only very few fighters know how to use Judo this way (Ronda,Fedor,Ishi,etc)"
judo,2zul3p,DominicHustle22,3,Sat Mar 21 23:55:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. We have both a wrestling and a judo class at my gym, and the gi makes a huge difference. It really changes the game."
judo,2zul3p,langoustine,3,Sun Mar 22 00:39:18 2015 UTC,"It's because it's like anything else. They're directly unrelated, but indirectly related I guess. You can pose that question to any fighter, or any style. Judo though is done, with significant pure dedication, by a very small majority of fighters. Because of that, on a chart, the effectiveness of said fighters will vary to the extremes and skew data. There's a bunch of shitty boxers and wrestlers but there's also some really good boxers and wrestlers. It has to do with the gameplan yes and moreso how well the fighter can adapt and setup his technique. The gi makes it harder and hip/shoulder tosses rely on such explosiveness and accuracy with minimal telegraphing.  As for Rousey, women's mma is too new IMO to really evaluate. There's bound to be someone head and shoulders above the rest of such a young division. You had Carano, then Cyborg, then whoever. As the division ages people will either become less susceptibile to her judo throws or she'll still dominate just as she always has; in that case it's because she's a great fighter period not just judoka."
judo,2zul3p,caseharts,4,Sun Mar 22 06:43:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a problem with just judo. Plenty of crossover athletes from all disciplines, while very good at their initial martial art, fair middlingly in MMA. People have already mentioned style as a reason, but I imagine there's a lot of ""x factor"" like mental adaptability and flexibility. Age is also sometimes a reason."
judo,2zul3p,Denny_Craine,2,Sun Mar 22 00:29:08 2015 UTC,Some can take a punch some can't.  Some are trancendant athletes meaning they'd be good at almost any sport.  Judo can be very specialized and some are more technicians than athletes. A guy like Lombard is not common athletically. Also rouseys dominance is mostly dye to the disparity in skill and ATHLETICISM.  Most of those girls started training at 20+ and are mediocre athletes. She's been doing it 20 years and is a world class one.
judo,2zul3p,aronnax512,2,Sun Mar 22 12:09:00 2015 UTC,I'm Rouseys biggest supporter but she's never ever faced a female equivalent of Cro Cop. That dude has completely trashed some of the most vicious grapplers in the world.  I mean the dude TKO'd Kazushi Sakuraba for christs sake

judo,2zs4cz,BigBizzle151,8,Sat Mar 21 05:17:01 2015 UTC,"Someone more experienced might come along and give a better answer or correct me, but:   In Judo to win you need only score Ippon. This can be achieved in various ways, one of which is throwing someone onto their back (with certain criteria relating to control and power fulfilled), thus if this is achieved there is no need to follow up. Because of the ""land on the back"" requirement, Judoka will often maintain their grip in order to ensure that their opponent doesn't spin out of the throw. More broadly, a Judoka is likely to do whatever it takes (including certain movements that would give their opponent their back) to make certain of a back landing. There is no concern for what happens afterwards as the fight will be over.   Obviously one of the concerns is that sometimes someone will do something that compromises their post-throw position and then not be awarded a full score by the referee, thus finding themselves in a situation where they are in trouble."
judo,2zs4cz,lostMartinet,8,Sat Mar 21 06:05:58 2015 UTC,"In short? Strange rules breed strange behaviour.  One way to win in contest it to throw your opponent on his back. How, is more or less up to you, except for certain actions. That means you can sacrifice your own stance and use your own weight or momentum to it's fullest to take your opponent down without fearing what might happen after throwing your opponent on his back.  The rules are also the reason why judoists assume turtle position that often. If one plays defensively on the ground and the opponent doesn't make any progress quickly, the fight will be interrupted and continued in standing position. Many competitors thus don't want to waste their energy on the ground.  This means that some judoists have to rethink their game when they deal with different rules or no rules at all."
judo,2zs4cz,Geschichtenerzaehler,4,Sat Mar 21 08:03:21 2015 UTC,"In Judo we also follow-up with ground work and grappling, however if we manage to throw someone cleanly rewarding an ippon (full score) the match is then over, you've won, so there is no need to continue grappling, which would be a waste of energy for the competitors.  Most of the time throws are not that perfect, so they are rewarded medium and minor scores, then the match continues after a throw with ground-work and submissions etc.   Why is it so? The philosophy is that you can view the 'ippon' as a signal of 'death to your opponent', from ancient times. In Japan the samurai wore armor. When their sword broke or they engaged in hand-to-hand combat the goal was to kill their enemy, a great way to do so was to throw them to the ground and use their tantō (short-blade) to finish off the enemy. Laying on the ground in heavy armor makes you vulnerable to being killed. So the ippon is a representation of that, you've been thrown cleanly onto the ground, your enemy now has a chance to kill you, you've lost."
judo,2zs4cz,Ryvai,2,Sat Mar 21 08:27:55 2015 UTC,"Because in the context of competition judo it's meaningless. Often, the match is won and finished the moment the opponent has been thrown on his back. Other times they've gone out of bounds and will be reset in the center. Gaining rear position scores no points."
judo,2zs4cz,yknik,2,Sat Mar 21 07:08:23 2015 UTC,"As with every sport, rule set dictates strategy.  Judoka throw to land with the opponent flat on their back with control and force as priority. Other sports have other priorities, this is generally the judokas priority (as is my understanding as a blue belt)"
judo,2zs4cz,internet_heyyo,2,Sat Mar 21 11:29:29 2015 UTC,"The throw is emphasized in Judo because if you get someone with a clean throw on the street and slam them into the ground, possibly landing on top of them, they'll surely not fighting at full strength after that, and possibly KO'd or dead. As far as ground attacks, they have to be quick and explosive. Much unlike bjj, where you can effectively play from top or guard with all the time in the world, in Judo you will be stood up if the bottom recovers guard, or if bottom is not pinned or submitted in 30 seconds. At least this was the case in the rules of the one tourney I competed in. Hence: Ronda Rousey."
judo,2zs4cz,rollin_ronin,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:25:52 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about this the other day - we always teach beginners to remain standing after a throw, but in competition I see a lot of people diving into a throw and even being rolled through immediately and retaining little to no control after the throw. Yet these throws, if done in such a way that the other person lands on their back, are still awarded ippon. This makes no sense to me."

So maybe that would require less ground work. source training traditional ju jutsu"
judo,2zselu,nicememeboss,5,Sat Mar 21 07:49:39 2015 UTC,"I did the exact same thing.   From day one, the teacher told me to wear a green belt (sankyu).  ""But I was 13!""  ""I don't care, you can't give up your judo rank. Many people have forgotten their judo, and they don't lose the belts.""  I still refused and wore a white belt, and got teased for it every class. I just worked at my own pace, remained humble, and tried to learn as much as I could.   After a while, it became obvious that i was above the level of a white belt. I could hold my own in randori with orange and greens, and it was kinda awkward.  9 months after I started, my teacher held gradings, and he allowed me to grade straight for green. I think Im going to stay at green for a long while, since I still need to work a lot on my harai goshi and my uchimata, but I don't see myself that far behind the other sankyus.  If I were you I would just wear white, be polite, and pay attention to class, and you'll probably get promoted early to orange. And that's it. At the end of the day, classifying people by the color of their belts is kinda silly."

judo,2zselu,r12477,3,Sat Mar 21 17:37:55 2015 UTC,"I've seen it go both ways at my club.  For myself, I only had a yellow belt as a junior, so it seemed very natural for me to start back from white as an adult.  For a couple of other guys who had blue or brown as juniors, they wore a white belt until their skills were back up to scratch and then picked up their previous coloured belts once more.  Ultimately, it will be a decision for you and your sensei to work through.  The only thing that I can add from my own experience is that it can be quite liberating working through the belts once more as an adult - There is less pressure to be able to perform once again at your previous level and it allows you to consolidate your skills once again.  More over, it gives you a chance to bridge the gap between what you could remember doing as a child/teen with what your body shape (and injuries) allows you to best do now."
judo,2zselu,Ryvai,2,Mon Mar 23 04:18:02 2015 UTC,"You will probably have to learn re-learn everything from scratch because your body has changed. The brain needs to re-adjust. But a belt stays with you for life, claim it, but be humble."
judo,2zselu,SVPPB,3,Sat Mar 21 08:19:41 2015 UTC,"In my experience, not really. Some of the basics, like the ukemi, really stay with you.  And the techniques come back very quickly, it's much easier than learning them for the first time."
judo,2zselu,Ryvai,3,Sat Mar 21 13:22:50 2015 UTC,"Well of course, it stays in your blood. But you need some readjusting. The osoto-gari from you where 11 is not the same as when you are 30 (biomechanically)."
judo,2zselu,r12477,2,Sat Mar 21 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely relate to this!  As a early teen, tai-otoshi was one of my favourite throws, but as a returning adult, I found that the dynamics of this throw were very different for me as a adult against other adults as opposed to a teen against adults from my previous experience.  It has taken a lot of re-learning to consolidate this difference in memory and body dynamics as an adult."
judo,2zselu,lostMartinet,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue. Used to be an orange belt when I was 11, and also got a green belt in ju jitsu in between.

judo,2zq076,bigbaze2012,9,Fri Mar 20 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"Please be aware that anything I say in this post I do not mean in an insulting manner.  I preface what I'm about to say only because sometimes I can come off as abrasive and I do not mean to sound that way.    For starters, it's my opinion that Judo has a big problem with mass appeal and I tend to blame it on the way it's structured and taught in most countries.  It sounds to me what you are doing is running a beginners class.  Now, I think your class structure if fine if you are running a class with experienced Judoka.  I think a 10 minute warm up is sufficient.  Personally speaking I can do without the uchi komi because most people don't do it properly anyway.  In my opinion if you want to get better at throwing, you throw.    Anyway, while I think your class structure is fine for experienced Judoka I think it's problematic for a beginner.  Think of it this way...as a beginner I walk in without a Judogi and all of the sudden I'm swept up into a warmup doing exercises that are completely foreign to me.  Not so much running but ukemi and shrimping.  It's very daunting for a beginner to be told to do something they don't know how to do.  So all of the sudden the warmup becomes the lesson.  Do you see what I mean?  Then, as you say, you do uchi komi for 10 minutes.  It appears to me that the first 30 minutes of class is essentially warm up and many of the things during that warmup is completely foreign to a beginner.    Perhaps a good way to go about it is to have a 10 minute warmup followed by actual lessons on ukemi which is followed by a basic technique.  As for randori, when I taught beginners I would be the only person doing randori with them and I would allow them to throw me.  Basically, it wasn't randori at all but dynamic moving throwing drills.  I would trip them from time to time to help them improve their balance and posture but the only person doing the throwing would be the student.  That is until they have enough basics down to even attempt randori."
judo,2zq076,Rockpyle,4,Fri Mar 20 19:00:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have come off abrasive at all here. This is really good advice.  I think your point about ""the warm up becoming the lesson"" is spot on. A good way for OP to think of it may be this; Imagine that a beginner is only able to learn, and actually remember, one or two things each lesson. If you are running through a load of drills that are entirely new to them in the first twenty minutes or so, by the time it gets to learning techniques their brain will already be frazzled.  A lot of the typical ""drills"" that happen in judo clubs, such as shrimping, are really skill development exercises. A beginner has no skills to develop yet.   Instead of introducing the shrimping action as a 'drill' or exercise at the start of the class, introduce it organically in newaza instruction. Escaping holds, creating space etc, then after a few weeks of this when they are familiar with the movement, encorporate it in the warm up.  You may be getting disheartened at this point with attendances so low, or think it's too late to encorporate some of the advice you're getting here. At the end of the day, Judo is hard. Teaching judo is even harder. Few judoka make great Sensei or even assistant coaches. Mostly because a lot will give up too early when it is hardest. Keep at it, keep learning and keep improving. Then try again next semester. Maybe look into some coaching courses on in your area or reach out to some successful clubs in other parts of the country/area you live and see if they can give you some advice."

I was thrown in with other beginners as a beginner and because of my speed and athleticism I was on the giving end of injuries to other beginners.  I threw a guy with kata guruma without ever being taught it (saw it in Best Judo book) one month in and knocked him out.  He wasn't ready or prepared for ukemi from a standing kata guruma.  I never meant to injure the few people that I did but cmon, two beginners doing their best in randori is chaos.

I've heard so many people say everyone will die and get injured, but not one of the students in the club I'm in have been truly injured in randori after a few classes.   I guess we've been lucky in that we don't have anyone who's an asshole or has to win at any cost or is mean in how they do it, I can understand how that might be dangerous.

If they think your instruction sucks or something like that, you need to know. If they have constructive ciritcism, listen to them. Your shedule looks good. But keep in mind that ""the same procedure as usual"" may bore even the most diligent student after a while. Switch the tachi waza part and the ne waza part once in a while. Use a wide varity of warm up exercises. Do a ""circle of techniques"" now and then (the students move from position to position after a minute or so, at each position they have to do a different exercise). Ukemi practice can be done in many different ways as well (including partner drills). Seek various ways to the same goal. Find out what newbies actually want/expect. A short survey might be a good idea. Some may come for fitness or competition, but there may also be a lot who want to cross train (coming from BJJ, wrestling or MMA) or learn judo for self defense. If there's an audience for it, offer no gi classes, lively kata training, self defense drills... there's a ton of options in judo if you are willing and able to teach them. Let newbies do randori. Very light and supervised of course. Set easy goals. Of course you have keep them safe, but I am sure you can think of various ways to let them at least get a tiny taste of fighting."
judo,2zq076,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Fri Mar 20 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"The students claim my instruction is good, I always ask after class if there is anything they would like to learn or have questions about. Alot of them say it's because they have schoolwork, but I'm a full-time student in a relatively tough major myself so sympathizing with them is hard.   Newbies usually don't what to expect. The few I have talked too after practice, had zero idea what judo was prior, some where disappointed it was not a striking art. Yet these same people will then complain that joint locks hurt too much, and that getting thrown hurts their back. It's very frustrating   A couple of BJJ and wrestling guys have come in before, and I do BJJ aswell I can help them out with changing some throws to fit BJJ. These usually don't come back either.   As I mentioned I try to make the first practice as exciting for beginners as possible. Usually a black belt will move around with them a bit during randori just so they get an idea."
judo,2zq076,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"So let's see ... students are overly busy with schoolwork. There are plenty of other martial arts available and some of the newbies are wusses... ""great"".   How about social networking? How is the social interaction with the practitioners before and after training? This can be an important factor as well. Is is possible to have a tea together before the training or a beer afterwards?  What about the training time? Would other days or times work better?   some where disappointed it was not a striking art   Well... judo has atemi waza ... if you know a few things about striking and kicking you actually can make it part of the training. At least how to deal with them from a grapplers perspectivity."
judo,2zq076,altiuscitiusfortius,2,Fri Mar 20 20:01:24 2015 UTC,Randori in my first class at university was what got me hooked and made me come back.  It was fun enough that I could put up with the drills in the first half of class.
judo,2zq076,waylonlove,3,Sat Mar 21 06:17:07 2015 UTC,"I started  the Bjj club at my university. We had a wrestling club and mma classes at the same facility, so most of the students came from there. Other than the email announcements sent out by the student association and a FB page I just talked to guys in the other clubs. Attendance was decent, 10-20 students usually.   One thing that you should consider is shortening class times. I saw people struggle with a 90 min class, 2 hours might feel like the min amount of time for a decent training session, but it is too long for most folks until they get serious. Hell, it looks like many Bjj schools have even cut back their classes to 60 minutes."
judo,2zq076,jujiroll,2,Fri Mar 20 23:11:37 2015 UTC,"I used to run a university club and when I took over it was really in the dumps, like I would go into classes and it would be just me and the instructor. In the space of two years I had it up to abut 10 regular attendees and enough casuals that we would usually have about 12-15 people per class, which is about as much as we could handle on our mat-space. We also won our national university championships, which was nice.   Now I don't know how much of this was down to me, and how much was just the natural ebb and flow clubs go through, but here are some of the things I think are important:   Get people invested: People have to feel that this is their club and not like it is just a class they attend once or twice a week. Get people involved in running things, get them invested in the club's success. This will make them more likely to turn up to class, and it will make them work to recruit more people. Promote the social aspect: Again people need to feel that it is more than just a class. Make sure you are friendly and welcoming, and make sure that the other students are welcoming to new people. Watch like a hawk for that new person who looks a little lost and doesn't have a partner. Don't let the regulars pair up with each other all the time. Have the occasional outside of class event, just don't let it turn into a drinking club with a judo problem. Focus on beginners: It's kind of short-changing the more experienced people who have put in effort, but unfortunately it has to be done. Focus on basic stuff in class, explain everything clearly, don't do too much in one class. Don't put people into randori too soon. I don't mean you have to keep them on the sideline for months, but throwing them in on their first night scares more people off than it attracts. Of course if they want to give it a go, let them, but do not even imply that it it is expected of them."

I'm the secretary at my university club, and we're lucky enough to have a local ""sponsor pub"" - we go along once a week for a few hours, buy drinks and they give us free food. Usually chips and nachos or individual chilli bowls. On top of that, after our midweek training session a lot of us tend to go to the student union and grab some food afterwards. I'm convinced that that social aspect encourages folk to keep attending."
judo,2zq076,OceanRacoon,2,Sat Mar 21 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same boat as you, OP, my college club had about 4-7 people in it last year but this year started off great, a bunch dropped off but we still had 15-20 and I thought they were a solid group but now most of them have bitched out as well.  Judo just isn't for most people. The amount of people who would come for one class and never come back (we stopped giving out gis to people this year because we learned our lesson last year), despite them saying they'll be back or they like it, or even that they'll come in the first place. You really start to stop believing people who say anything about committing to it.  It's coming towards the end of the year, so that probably has something to do with the loss of attendance, and work is piling up. Judo just isn't a priority for other people the way it is for us. When they feel sore after practice, it makes them not want to come back. When they can't seem to get a throw to work, it makes them want to quit instead of practice more. There's just way more easier things to spend your time doing than working hard at judo in your free time, with it's long learning curve.  But a lot of people probably don't know the club exists, go to the gym and talk to people there or leave up signs. You'd think a fit person who does nothing except work out would want to use their body for something"

There was a time when I stabbed the short sword into my abdomen to see if I could really die or not. I thought, okay – if I just pull the sword now then it’ll be done. So first is the match, then I just have to pull it in one swift stroke. Then I was at ease – I had proven to myself that I would be able to die.

Kimura's ""double and tripple your effort"" isn't modern training but japanese were influenced by this approach and it is rooted in japanese culture (learning and learning and learning). Seisenbacher as one of the first Judoka discovered in the 80ies, that you have to have some periodisation of your training to reach the very highest level.

That being said, learning the internal arts (which Aikido is suppose to be, but few dojos really are) takes a long time.  The primary reason is that you have to change the way you create movement in your body.  You cannot do two different operating systems at once and expect to gain anything useful.  Aikido with Aiki (internal power) is simply crude and not so realistic jujitsu.  Aikido with it..... I love playing with other arts now.  As an ""older"" man, people wonder how I can do what I do :)  I would say, stick with one or the other.  It would be a waste of your time to try and spend a little time getting a little from Aikido."

So far, after about 4 years of Judo I've yet to encounter a situation with skin-infections. I've heard about one case of ringworm, but that was probably due to someone borrowing the dojo and bringing it there. The fact that we use gi's limits the threat of infection somewhat as there is limited skin contact compared to say wrestling. From my experience it seems that dojo cleaning procedures are good, compared to many other sports. If someone in the dojo do get some kind of infection the sensei must be informed immediately. The entire dojo needs to be cleaned thoroughly, all Judoka must wash all their gi's (including belts) and the person must not return to the mats until the infection is gone +1-2 weeks to make sure."

Generally, on your first few classes you only do groundfighting, and maybe some very gentle randori against high level students.  It's not very safe to pit beginners against each other when they don't even know how to breakfall.  This shouldn't discourage you!

judo,2zn1aj,silvaphysh13,3,Sat Mar 21 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you had fun in learning the basics.   The techniques you learned are probably ""O-soto-otoshi"" (very roughly translated to big-outside-throw) and the hold ""Mune-gatame"". Especially with throws it is useful to know the terms, as they describe the throw oftentimes and make it easier to remember them.

Most Japanese technique names are super literal, with the odd poetic term like yama arashi or kuchiki taoshi thrown in for good measure."

It's even more confusing now too, since my Sensei actually complimented me on my ouchi gari during my grading, and pre-grading, only to say I was doing it wrong a few days ago because my head was over the opposite shoulder.  I prefer head over opposite shoulder because of the chest contact, and it works well in randori.  However, when demonstrating, I'll probably do it his way."
judo,2zmiux,newhoza,2,Tue Mar 24 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"The way my teacher likes to explain; is that to achieve proper kuzushi you have to imagine you are shooting an arrow into the ground to uke's left and behind him.  Your right hand pushes uke's shoulder to his back left, your left hand pulls upwards to his front right, so it looks like you are aiming and drawing an imaginary bow. At the moment of contact your head goes forward, with your sight fixed on your imaginary bowshot's point of aim.  As for the legs, your big toe is supposed to draw a circle on the mat as it reaps. My teacher makes us do endless repetitions of shadow uchikomi across the mat, and if he doesn't hear the toe brush the tatami, he chews us out.  Finally, your support foot has to rotate on it's ball, making the rest of your body turn."

judo,2zmiux,yknik,1 point,Sat Mar 21 08:52:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're worrying too much about what your hands are doing. My personal approach is to have a relaxed, normal grip, turn perpendicular to the direction uke is facing, and take a small sidestep away from them. Then, take an uke-goshi like side in towards them, while making as big of a circle as you can with your reaping leg, trying to keep your big toe brushing along the ground. Then, if you still need extra kake (which I find I rarely do with this setup) you can ""undress the shoulder"" of the side they're falling on. I've gotten several ippons now in shiai with this, and many, many more in randori."

The sensei will usually say something like; clear your thoughts, focus on your breathing and think about something that you enjoyed about the session, something positive that you felt you did right, he will then shout out; mokusō! After a little while the sensei should say; mokusō, yame! which means 'stop'. Everyone opens their eyes, now in a more relaxed state and we perform za-rei and end the practice feeling awesome :)"
judo,2zlc05,Ryvai,3,Thu Mar 19 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification! Wasn't sure how it was meant to be written. My sensei will usually say ""Everyone think of one thing that went well tonight."""
judo,2zlc05,silvaphysh13,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"黙想 means ""silent thinking""  there are two different forms of meditation: one is ""jing zuo"" 靜坐 (quiet sitting) and derives from Neoconfucianism and the other is ""za zen"" 座禅 (sitting thinking) which derives from Chan/Zen. They are same in form but different in aims.  There is also a daoist form - its called ""zuo wang"" (sitting and forget).   ."
judo,2zlc05,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"In Japanese those characters appear to be used to describe mokusō and in a Judo-sense used for meditation. Mokusō is a kind of meditation where we sit in seiza and think positive thoughts and reflect on the training-session. Those other forms are interesting, but they look Chinese?"
judo,2zlc05,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Synchronizing exhalation with certain actions like ukemi, or the kake phase of throws or atemi is very important. It protects the lungs and creates body tension when needed.  In randori I try to keep calm and maintain a steady breathing rhythm (except for certain key moments as mentioned above). In Ne Waza I use Osae Komi Waza and other positions as phases of recovery. My goal is: Make him work hard while I relax.  For recovery after strenous exercises special breathing techniques exist. Kyuzo Mifune describes one in his book, the Canon of Judo: Standing upright, pulling the shoulders back, extending the chest, inhaling as deeply as possible. A similar technique is rising the arms up towards the ceiling while inhaling."

judo,2zimfv,Awlks,3,Wed Mar 18 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"He is violent and threatening against the staff-member. He might have a gun for all they know. Those kind of people needs to be taken out before it gets dangerous. The police officer was in the right doing so. Keep in mind we don't know what led up to this situation, he might have stabbed someone in the face with a bottle for all we know."
judo,2zimfv,dave_attenburz,3,Wed Mar 18 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind we don't know what led up to this situation   Regardless of what has happened before, the cop has his hands on him, turn him around and put the cuffs on, job done. The guy wasn't even resisting being lead away.   The cops aren't there to act as retribution for something the guy did earlier, they're there to arrest him. He could have killed that guy with that throw, there was absolutely no need for it and like most American cops on video, he seems to have little regard for citizens' wellbeing.  And if you say, ""Well he's arresting him,"" you're falling into the same trap he has. That doesn't make it okay and it's ridiculous of him to escalate an easy arrest so dangerously and with such disregard for the guy's safety, even if he is a dick"
judo,2zimfv,Ryvai,2,Fri Mar 20 04:10:13 2015 UTC,"He might have a gun        Anyone out there ""might have a gun"". Doesn't sound like a reason to whack someone's head into asphalt."
judo,2zimfv,dave_attenburz,4,Fri Mar 20 04:49:30 2015 UTC,I'm of the opinion that the police have an obligation to at least attempt dialog before engaging physically.
judo,2zimfv,Ryvai,5,Thu Mar 19 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they have tried before, this is just the escalated segment of the situation. If they approach him calmly from a distance he might pull out that knife or gun he might be in possession of. Additionally this guy has already escalated the situation to violence. Once he acts in that manner it is beyond calm dialogue and the Police needs to think safety for themselves, the people in the area and not to mention the perpetrator himself. Assess the situation rationally from the Police's point of view, they are protecting you and your children from crazy out of control people like that guy."
judo,2zimfv,dave_attenburz,-1,Thu Mar 19 00:10:26 2015 UTC,"Police brutality has a lot of factors, if this technique is banned for that type of officer than this is police brutality.   A lot of countries have banned police from using any choke holds because people have died, so even if an officer is a skilled judoka and knows what he is doing it is brutality.  We see a throw we would use in self defence but the public sees a slam that could kill him if he lands improperly. It's up to his higher ups and judges whether this was appropriate or if he needs some training on an alternative way to take people down."
judo,2zimfv,Ryvai,2,Thu Mar 19 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"From the evidence presented here the guy was shouting and aggressive but hasn't injured anyone. This cop has steamed in and dumped his head carelessly onto tarmac. With total impunity as well, the cop isn't going to face gbh or assault charges if the drunk ends up with a concussion or worse.   If the cop wasn't trained to safely take someone to the ground he shouldn't have engaged."
judo,2zk3lw,bigbaze2012,5,Thu Mar 19 05:46:08 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you've got your terminology right? The defining characteristic of the DLR guard is the DLR hook (see white's left foot), but you don't even mention that in your post.   Anyway, there are lots and lots of different open guards people use in BJJ, it's not just DLR. In BJJ, either using the guard (open or otherwise) or passing it is huge, and many matches spend most of their time with one player playing guard. Naturally, BJJ people have developed many strategies for this situation. In judo, as people have mentioned, due to limited newaza time and standup rules, the guard is much less relevant, and consequently there are fewer strategies for using it or passing it."
judo,2zk3lw,sasquatch007,2,Thu Mar 19 10:47:43 2015 UTC,"This is a position that occurs for very short moments only in judo. We trained it a bit in our club, but it's nothing special. We trained how to block the standing up partner with our feet properly, as he tries to pass on either side.  There's not much to do as either not much will happen from there and you're stood up (as Ryvai said), or you quickly progress into a position you already know well (he passes your feet, or comes close and ends up in guard)."
judo,2zk3lw,Hippocampus88,2,Thu Mar 19 10:15:25 2015 UTC,"It hardly occurs I believe, but if you come off of a failed sacrifice throw of flying armbar you might have a second or two to work with. I think you would get stood up if you don't sweep really fast though."

After you learn, say, 20 throws or so, you start developing your own arsenal that fits your style. A lanky guy like you can excel at leg sweeps. A short, quick judoka can use hip throws.

judo,2zfs52,dermatix,7,Wed Mar 18 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"Good video. I think it is essential here to understand, that an uke, who tries to regain an upright posture shifts his weight towards his toes (if you don't believe me, bent forward and then get upright again, you'll feel your weight shift back to your heels when you bent down, and you'll feel it shift forward when you bent back up).  I really like how Nomura provokes such an action from his opponent. He has him pulled down and steps close to his opponents foot, making him pull it back. Unfortunately for the opponent he cannot do that without getting upright. Sweet trap."

judo,2zfjis,SVPPB,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"kouchi game?  kouchi gare?  I fear you got the names wrong.  The technique (very, very badly) demonstrated here is Ko Uchi Gari. There are two very distinct variants of this technique:  One were uke assumes a defensive posture with his weight resting on his heels. In this case attacking the foot requires actual reaping, meaning it is truely a ""gari"" technique then, because uke's weight is resting on that foot.  The other variant is executed, when uke takes a step. The foot is swept in that case after uke begins to send his weight to that foot, but before the foot completely rests. This is very similar to De Ashi Harai, but applied from the inside instead of the outside. There has been some discussion to rename the latter variant to Ko Uchi Harai, but since it is a classical Gokyo technique, the Kodokan decided against renaming it. Thus both variants go by the name Ko Uchi Gari."

judo,2zfjis,anypoo,1 point,Thu Mar 19 06:06:09 2015 UTC,Well hopefully I get this right;  a) No Kuzushi  b) Position of tori's body in relation to uke is too perpendicular. Tori's body should be more square to uke's to prevent being countered.  Really can't see anymore (first time critiquing a technique)
judo,2zfjis,anypoo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 07:42:17 2015 UTC,"a) No Kuzushi   That's one of the biggest problems here.   b) Position of tori's body in relation to uke is too perpendicular. Tori's body should be more square to uke's to prevent being countered.   Actually the setup in the clip is so shitty, that discussing what his best angle for the attack would be, is kind of useless. ;)"
judo,2zfjis,Ryvai,2,Wed Mar 18 16:45:41 2015 UTC,Am I wrong in thinking there is some kuzushi? It appears he's pulling uke down towards the leg he plans on reaping and also lifting up in a wheel motion with the other arm.
judo,2zfjis,anypoo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:38:46 2015 UTC,"Tori does something that somewhat looks like the movements necessary to apply kuzushi, but it seems like an empty gesture. Uke falls because he does it by himself, not because he must. Also just pushing there will never work in randori. It has to be part of a more complex action.  Take a look at Jane Bridge's Ko Uchi Gari  for comparison. She demonstrates the hand action excellently here imho:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ITwapP2hqw"
judo,2zfjis,Ryvai,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"The head controls the body.  For this grip and this throw, I'd be pushing the heel of my tsurite hand into the chin / jawline - this ""encourages"" the head to move backwards, which pulls the body with it, which puts them in a nice position for kouchi. Same applies for osotogari, for example (for certain grips) - the friendly version is pushing aggressively over the shoulder, the competition version moves the head.  Hence - the head controls the body.   I googled for 'tsurite kouchigari' and came across this blog, which explains a lot of this nicely: http://thedifficultway.blogspot.ca/2011/01/attack-chest.html  That's just one aspect of the missing kuzushi, but one of the more egregious imo. The wet fish uke doesn't really help either."

judo,2zfjis,anypoo,3,Wed Mar 18 07:41:16 2015 UTC,"A month? Don't worry, it's completely normal not hitting with anything after that short time, especially against more experienced partners.   Keep on trying. Don't get afraid of counters. Keep attacking. Try to prepare your throws better. Make your opponent move. Test out their reactions to certain actions, act accordingly. Check back with your instructor. Do you do your throws right? Is the distance right? Do the hands do the right job ? Don't give up."

Bruce Lee's words: ""I don't fear a man, who has practiced 10.000 kicks, I fear a man, who practiced one kick 10.000 times."" The same holds true for judo throws."
judo,2zfjis,ckristiantyler,2,Fri Mar 20 09:19:20 2015 UTC,"Ask your instructor for guidance. If he watches you during randori he/she can quickly identify mistakes. I think most instructors appreciate a student being humble and asking for their expertise. What worked for me was studying some of the best instructors in world from seminars on YouTube, trying to get a grasp on what they are actually 'doing'. After a while I started making progress. I think it's been referred to as physiological intelligence or something like that, the ability to see someone do something and be able to mentally picture yourself doing it and emulate. At some point your brain will learn it and you get that 'Aha!' moment where you just get it. Good luck with your training :)"

judo,2zfjis,silvaphysh13,2,Thu Mar 19 05:10:57 2015 UTC,"I like to grab uke's right elbow and pushing it down and inwards (the arm is bent a bit Ude Garami style). If he resists and tries to rise his elbow up, ideally rising his upper body as well, I jump-turn (tobi komi) in for Ippon Seoi Nage.  A similar trick is gripping kenka yotsu, he has his hand at my lapel and I have mine at his lapel on the same side with my arm is over his (be careful this can be exploited by him in various ways). I pull him down and towards me with that arm while pressing down his arm at the elbow. Again: If he tries to rise up, I take a quick jump turn and throw Ippon Seoi Nage.  Another version of this is gripping his right sleeve at the end near his wrist, then taking a sideway jump to my right while pulling his arm down and to the right. If he resists, I turn on my left foot. It some kind of Mawari Komi entry.  Other ways to use ISN are ""the dive"" meaning you forcefully ""worm"" your arm forward over his left arm and under his right arm. Anton Geesink describes this ins one of his books. The idea is entering ISN  in a straight, diagonal line first, securing arm and shoulder of uke and then taking a short half turn, instead of entering with the arm during a full turn.  Yet another way is anticipating a collar grip form uke, taking his extended arm and turning away from him into ISN with a Hikidashi entry.  Note for all these entries: A certain distance to uke is necessary, otherwise he'll block your hips."
judo,2zfjis,nicememeboss,1 point,Thu Mar 19 06:23:08 2015 UTC,"If you are fighting BJJ players its likely they have a very bent over stance. My instructor teaches me to 'dive' into seio in this case, basically concentrating on getting your legs as far through your opponents as you can with your body leaning sightly forward and I have had a  decent amount of success with this in BJJ."
judo,2zfjis,nicememeboss,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:41:50 2015 UTC,"Anyone do sode tsuri komi goshi in this way: instead of putting the arm straight ahead of you, you put the arm to the diagonal and squat low as they go over your hips?

judo,2zess9,dermatix,6,Tue Mar 17 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really remember mine, but I think one of my teammates hit his tonight. He's been plateauing pretty hard lately, even getting thrown by newer guys, so I've been staying after class to work with him one on one. We were doing light randori, and I was trying to demonstrate the concept of reading the opponent, laying traps and throwing in combinations. I demonstrate with one of my favorite combos: ippon seoi nage to kata guruma. He thinks about it for a while, then gets up, and instead of going for seoi nage, he goes for ouchi gari. I back step to avoid it and he catches me completely off-guard with a smooth seoi nage.   I asked him what his thought process was, and he said he realized that I would back our a certain angle, and that he intercepted me just like I told him to - just with a completely different combination than I told him to. He understood the concept well enough to apply it generally rather than simply mimic the lesson.   I think his plateau is over."
judo,2zess9,bear-knuckle,3,Wed Mar 18 02:25:17 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I've had so many of those moments that I don't think about it much anymore.  My first was probably as a 2nd kyu when I started to feel a lot more loose in randori and had a couple of decent throws."

It was pure reflex, not thoughts involved. It was the most beautiful ippon I've ever done. Clean landing on the back and I stood there with an internal pride bigger than the statue of liberty."

I had my green belt at the time and I am all for learning other combat sports so my friend took me to his BJJ school. When it came time to roll, I was very confused at first. These guys were doing things I was taught to specifically not to do. They were keeping very low, shooting for leg takedowns, pulling guard, I wasn't used to this shit. First couple rounds I got my ass handed to me standing and on the ground. Then around my third roll, I faced a skilled blue belt. He went for a double leg takedown, I sprawled and quickly threw him with sumi gaeishi. I was ecstatic that the technique I learned could be used even in a strange environment. Soon after I adjusted my game a little bit I was able to throw most of the other players in the lower rank like my self.  After about a month of practice, when it came time to roll , most of the white and blue belts wouldn't even bother standing up with my, most would pull guard or go into del a hiva."

The picture for Seoi Otoshi depicts a Seoi Nage for example (it is taken from a video of people who didn't get the difference either).  I fear you try too much at once. If I were you, I'd just pick one technique for now. Research it well, check and compare with various sources. Make a special feature, just about that single technique.

It is a devastating to your opponent both physically, psychologically and whatever else.  imagine getting tackled at the chest with no where else to go but down because your legs postureis getting ripped out from under you.  Fucking Osotogari. Be wary of it's transition into osotomakikomi.  only then will you learn true pain."

judo,2zd79v,newhoza,2,Tue Mar 17 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"At first you drill osotogari with other white and yellow belts, and it's sort of a little sweep and a shove to the mat. Sometimes, you get locked up in a shitty entrance against a balanced opponent, and you end up awkwardly pushing each other without a clue of what to do.  Then one day you get hit with an osotogari in randori, by a heavyweight brown or black belt. That's when you truly appreciate the power in that throw. Fucking brutal."

But do you not think removing leg attacks (with the hands) and all the crazy rules on cross gripping, belt gripping, etc are not going too far?  being ""different"" from wrestling is not a good reason for removing effective techniques in my mind.

judo,2zf18n,dave_attenburz,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:00:41 2015 UTC,"I do agree that it's retarded. But the reason its retarded is because morote gari, kata guruma (still possible without touching legs), kuchiki taoshi etc embodied the principles of judo, not that kano introduced them.   Judo owes a lot to kano but is now bigger than him so it doesn't really matter what his personal opinion or actions were."

Do they think we are idiots?  The irony for me is that I NEVER used morote gari, (im a sucker for hip throws) but I wrestle outside of Judo and its a move that i feel like is absolutely necessary to know how to defend against.  When I tell wrestlers that singles and doubles (as they know them) were banned from judo they literally laugh in my face.  Kata guruma is a throw that I love and is also popular in wrestling, and they also raise eyebrows when I tell them its now for all intents and purposes illegal.  I mean i guess you can do it without touching the legs but one small mistake is going to cost you points now."

judo,2zc30n,Ryvai,12,Tue Mar 17 09:57:58 2015 UTC,"The problem here is this:  When tori executes Seoi Otoshi like this, uke cannot protect his head using standard ukemi. Uke has to post a hand (which isn't ideal either) or will fall on his head and may (even on mats) suffer a concussion.  For safety reasons instructors should do two things:   Teach the emergency ukemi variant necessary for this. Teach proper Seoi Otoshi, where tori pulls uke's arm towards his knee and thus allows him to fall properly.   Historical sidenote:  Technically, throwing uke on his head isn't wrong from a martial arts point of view (it is merely counter-productive for sport and practice purposes). This is actually the way how most throws were executed, before Kano changed that (simply for practice purposes). In real combat, throwing the opponent on his head was an effective way to kill or seriously injure him."

She is so small that her uke is in danger of hitting his head on the floor. He naturally puts his hand down to protect it.  That's basically it, but you have to keep some important points in mind:   Plant your hand about where your head would hit the ground. Do not straighten your arm. Keep it bent and flexible. Just enough tension to protect your head. Do not try to stop the throw. Just cushion your fall a bit. Otherwise it is like taking a roll forward. Keep you chin tucked in all the time, as usual."

If your opponent resists being thrown on his back and thus lands badly, it is his fault. If you apply an armlock and give him time to surrender, but he doesn't, it is his fault.  I wrote ""doing this intentionally"" (you know what that word means, do you?). If you throw somebody on their head with the intention to do, meaning you aim to make them fall on their head and not on their back, then you are willingly endangering their health."

The 1965 edition was also translated by someone else. The language is (from what I heard) rather flowery, but closer to the Japanese original. I bought the 2004 edition new for like 40-50$, which is a good and fair price for it. The translation of the 2004 edition still seems flowery (thus I guess the 1965 is even harder to read), also the text doesn't seem to match the pictures in some occasions. The layout is a bit confusing at times.  That aside it is a great source, especially if you are the research type of judoka who likes to compare judo then and now.

There's no amount of learning the history of Judo that will make your technique better.  At my club learning about the ranks and history is a greater focus in the kid's classes. It's understood that adults who have an interest will do the research themselves. That being said, if those types of lessons are something that would allow you to get greater enjoyment out of Judo, then I don't see any reason you shouldn't seek that out."

Go to your sensei with your questions and pay attention, because you claim your sensei ""teaches you how to make your throws more hurtful,"" which goes against judo principals."
judo,2zb3th,monkeycycling,4,Tue Mar 17 03:37:24 2015 UTC,"I started a couple months ago. [...] And though I can defend myself in  randori (lately) and execute a couple throws, I still have problems.   That's totally normal. Learning Judo takes a lot of time.   I also expected to learn some formal aspects of the way   This depends largely on the instructor and place you attend. Some insist more on certain traditions and ""rituals"", others do less so. It has little to no influence on the technical quality of the instruction or how well you will learn to fight.  Some instructors consider judo to be a sport and focus mostly on competition and it seems your sensei belongs in that category. That means the good thing to take away from here is learning how to fight within the rules of the sport (not more, not less).  There are also groups that go the opposite direction and put too much emphasis on rituals (often making them an end within itself while forgetting about the real purpose) and do little to no randori. People wearing nice belts and gis, doing lots of bowing, but unable to fight.  Best would be a place that allows you to explore all aspects of judo (which can be hard to find): The competition sport, the martial art, the physical education and the pedagogy system, including randori of all sorts, detailed technical instruction, freedom to explore, kata, self defense...  So what should a judoka know about formalities? It isn't much, but it should be done right.   Bow to your partner before you start practicing/sparring together and afterwards. Do this in the mindset of mutual respect. You signalize him, that you respect him as a human being, that you'll keep him safe and you'll do your best to support him in making progress. You also thank your partner this way for his trust, time and effort in helping you making progress. Bowing shouldn't be a gesture of submission. If a picture of Jigoro Kano is present in the dojo, do a bow in it's direction when you step onto the mat. He's long dead and it's just a picture, but I think it is important that we keep in mind that we are standing upon the shoulders of giants, not only in science but also in martial arts and that only great effort and persistance will get us anywhere. It is a good time to reflect about these things while showing one's respect towards the founder of our art.   About belts: There isn't much to know about them. They hold your gi together. They come in different colors which are supposed to indicate a certain rank. What color represents what rank is different from country to country and even federation to federation. The rank says little about the actual technical or martial ability of the wearer though. There are many many wannabes with high rank belts in martial arts and unfortunately, although they seem somewhat rarer in judo, our art is not free of them."

judo,2zarzr,Not_Nigerian_Prince,6,Tue Mar 17 00:58:56 2015 UTC,"I personally love going for the o soto gari, as it's one of the more successful moves for me during randori. The key thing with O soto gari is that you have to position yourself and your opponent so that when you move in for the sweep, they are already more unbalanced than you are. What you could do to help, is to add in combinations to it.   Honestly though, O soto gari has a lot of intricate details for it to be performed successfully. Here is a youtube link that explains it better than me. Also, it's very helpful!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHAlYRNMt-E"
judo,2zarzr,etanolx04,5,Tue Mar 17 01:15:02 2015 UTC,"I was having some problems with catching a good o soto gari in randori as well. Remember a few things:  The throw does not start with the hands. While the hands do play a big part of the kuzushi, early hand motion also telegraphs the upcoming throw to uke. Start the kuzushi with your hara, letting the hands complete the kuzushi.  Try to match your partner's rhythm during randori. Then, as you start your entry into o soto gari, speed up a bit. Not two steps before your entry, but during the entry.  If your partner stiffens up, that's fine. He/she just gave you an advantage. Time for hane goshi, tai otoshi, seoi nage, or any number of throws. Straight-arming a partner and stiffening up leaves you vulnerable to follow-up techniques. Combinations are one of your best methods for successfully throwing a defensive partner (and maybe teaching them not to be so defensive).  Hope this helps. And one more thing: follow through!"

judo,2zarzr,war_lobster,2,Tue Mar 17 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"In general, ""hara"" means your abdomen or your core. Or, as my sensei says, ""about two inches behind your belly button."" If you take a moment to think about how you walk every day, you will probably find that you start your motion from your legs, and your legs pull you around. It's just how we typically walk. But in Judo, walking around taking big steps will leave you open to a lot of foot sweeps. Instead, let your hara lead your legs. I don't mean stick your belly out, but imagine a rope attached to your abdomen. Feel that imaginary rope tug at your hara. Let that move you. It's kind of a weird concept, and I probably didn't write it eloquently enough, but I hope this gives you an idea."
judo,2zarzr,da_choppa,2,Tue Mar 17 23:09:50 2015 UTC,"A proper osoto gari is sort of a low percentage move by itself because it's a powerful throw, and like many power throws, it's easy to telegraph. A typical concession is to do a ""ken ken"" or hopping osoto gari, where one can start the throw more from an outfighting position, and gradually hop inwards to finish the throw.  Generally, I only get a proper ""power"" osoto maybe 1 out of 5 to 10 times I do osoto. However, the real power of a proper osoto is in combinations, because the threat of a powerful (yet low commitment!) move like osoto will force reactions and opportunities. The first thing would be to learn how to do a proper osoto, then learn some basic combinations. I recommend reading this blog post, it summarises how to do a proper osoto and has the two basic combinations I use all the time to great effect. Osoto to ouchi is really elegant if uke overreacts in defence.  Osoto is also a great finishing throw in a combination sequence, especially when you have uke backpedalling and breaking his/her own balance in the very direction you want to throw-- combining ashi-waza (leg techniques) are key if you want to finish with osoto. If your playing style is pressure, osoto is invaluable."

judo,2zarzr,pandawdy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:03:50 2015 UTC,"The most common way to apply osoto-gari is by what I call 'hook, hop and reap'. You basically use yours hands so that the opponent has his weight on the leg you want to reap by twisting his torso, you then hook your leg behind their kneecap, use that hook to hop in to the standard osoto-gari position, then continue with the hands so that they are completely out of balance. At this point you can reap the leg, while still contacting it. It is most often what is done in competitions. You can see Ono perform it this way here. Some people refer to it as the kenken-osoto-gari (hopping osoto-gari)."
judo,2zarzr,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Mar 17 07:50:41 2015 UTC,O soto gari is quite difficult to get if you are attacking straight into uke.  I like to step out at about a 45 degree angle.  It helps collapse a stiff arm and you can finish either with a standard or hopping reap.  Timing your hands and feet with how uke is stepping also makes a big difference In creating kuzushi.

Once you have to turn your head and smack the mat with your palm, it feels like your body is naturally dropping itself which causes momentum to help you manipulate your weight with little energy compared to sitting up. You'll also notice in the video how his foot naturally plants on the mat after the roll and the other leg sits on the knee. This is so second nature that no one even talks about it but you'll catch people do it all the time. I remember being so fatigued that I stayed still with my legs behind my head until my toes naturally accelerated to the floor. This made my weight shift into an energy conservative back roll, all in slow motion. I felt like a blob.   Richie doesn't mention how to get up when flat on your back since his lecture starts from sitting up. When spread out like a starfish, bring your hands in front of your face like you're expecting to get punched. Perform a bicycle kick with one leg by pedaling your knee towards you and then kick the air to create momentum that can be borrowed to effortlessly explode a sit-up. Also punch both arms out to help sit up faster and cut energy use. Your kick's nearside arm stays extended to protect your face while the other hand snaps to the mat parallel to your center line (hips) to make a base. Don't let your heel touch the mat after you kick, immediately shoot it towards your groin to make a base. The posting hand and heel is what's holding you steady and will noticeably feel comfortable. You're leaning slightly to the side where the hand is posting so to make that post stronger and more comfortable. This brings you precisely to Richie's starting point. These steps were emphasized by my instructor. It seems so subtle I suppose some folks don't catch it. Sit-ups push-ups and squats however are what'll simplify sitting up, pushing up to your knees, and squatting back up. :)"

judo,2z7nvf,fedornuthugger,2,Mon Mar 16 14:02:48 2015 UTC,"As a Judo player who transitioned into BJJ, I've found a good way to take advantage of tendencies wrestlers have.   1- Win the top grip and sleeve(or elbow) grip  2- they almost always take this as an invitation to duck under your top grip and shoot on your lead right leg for a single   3- When they duck under you need to turn the top grip behind their neck into a same side lapel as they duck or even before they duck for the single (if you want to be more agressive) do a circular motion for your elbow and arm over their head to get your forearm cross face and lapel on same side as the sleeve/elbow grip. This Elbow and cross face will give you the space to defend the single - and your proper sleeve/elbow grip will prevent him from getting his right hand involved in the attack.   4- once you have your cross face same side lapel and sleeve/elbow you can proceed to ragdoll them or pivot for a reaction + o-soto gari or pivot and do a monster ippon seoinage.   Once I get this position I usually shake them down to break their posture up and down - side to side and get some good kazushi before a big throw.   The key is many wrestlers find the position advantageous in no Gi - but in gi the lapel grip completely blocks the single if you maintain your sleeve/elbow grip. Once you have same side lapel and elbow/sleeve grip most of them wont have the experience with grip fighting to know they are in trouble.  I have had great sucess with this. You need to be able to grip fight. The natural crouch of a wrestler's stance usually gives you the top grip pretty easily. The issue is being technical with the grips, fast and strong enough to catch the sleeve and elbow grip and tighten it up. Once you get the position, if you are experienced in Judo, Uchi-Mata, Ippon seoinage, O-soto Gari and Drop-Seoinage are all there for you - so is the Kazushi. I have finished some bjj matches from the impact of this seoi nage before. - it is also a very quick transition to Kaze-Gatame after your throw. You just need to be careful not to give up your back."

judo,2z6xts,chadmiral_ackbar,5,Mon Mar 16 02:46:36 2015 UTC,"Lack of progression. If you're not working towards something (and at least slowly getting there) it gets reset. Technically if you are consistently working then the groundwork can go the entire match. If your opponent is just defending and you haven't been able to break their defences after a while then it will be reset.  Some referees are less knowledgeable on the ground though so sometimes things are missed. Happens more often at lower levels but can happen anywhere.  Note that there has never been a ""time limit"" for ground-work, that is a myth.  Another thing to keep in mind is that because of the ""sudden death"" aspect to a quick loss by throw many Judoka will ""give up"" on working for something on the ground if they don't feel they will get it easily enough in order to conserve energy. This can happen even if the person giving up is much better on the ground than their opponent as it is (somewhat) easier to hold off an attack for a short period than succeed in getting one."
judo,2z6xts,porl,3,Mon Mar 16 03:36:46 2015 UTC,"This. The ref's either want to see progression or an technique-in-action. If your opponent takes you down in some form, don't just pull guard and play the chess-game. Immediately set something up that at least looks like it might be 'something', then move from there. If you take your opponent down, use the most effective guard-passes, use techniques that clearly shows progression and make sure it's visible to the ref :)"
judo,2z6xts,Ryvai,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks - that totally makes sense. :)  It's interesting though - when I roll in BJJ, I feel like most progress is seemingly invisible. My opponent might shift weight slightly, or I engage a muscle that shifts the balance in my favor, allowing for a sweep or submission. Progression like that would likely be invisible to a ref, though.  Two sides of the same coin..."
judo,2z6xts,fedornuthugger,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:25:54 2015 UTC,Yep - that and a lot of the refs aren't super educated on the ground work. I've been stood up while having a high guard and setting up a triangle/armbar many times.
judo,2z6xts,Sirkkus,3,Mon Mar 16 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"/u/porl has a good answer. To add a bit, keep in mind that groundwork in competitive judo is supposed to be transitional, i.e. if an attack from either side is unsuccessful and the players end up on the ground, the action can keep going in a continuous flow into groundwork. If the continuous flow stops, then the action that was initiated by the attack from standing has ""ended"" and players are stood up.  This framing of groundwork is obviously very different from a sport like BJJ, where the groundwork is the focus of the contest."

Its much easier, if you can get some distance, because than you can even move a heavy opponent in circles and you can allways jump out of distance of the throw of a heavy one. If you are close as a heavy one, you can use your weight for many throws and counters.  To sutemi waza: You have to be skilled and fast as a heavy one to do an explosive sutemi waza.

Here are some Kuzushi tricks...  ... imagine your opponents feet were connected with a line. If you push or pull orthogonally to that line, your opponent must take a step to regain his balance. Use this to your advantage.  ... whenever your opponent takes a step into any direction, try to exaggerate that movement.  ... the weight shifts to the toes when a bent body returns to an upright posture. Pull uke down a bit and pull him forward when he tries to rise again.  ... try to provoke reactions. Push him to make him push back, pull him to one side, to make him pull in the opposite direction. This is called Hando no Kuzushi.  ... circles and sideway movements are your friends. The human body is able to move rather fast forward and backward, but if you force somebody into a fast sideway or circular movement, he'll have to fight to stay on his feet.  ... Use the third dimension. Lean into your opponent or lower your own center of mass to influence him more. Pulling down first then up as mentioned above.  ... Combine attacks. Small foot techniques are great to set up big throws.  .. Try to get your opponent into akward postures. Try to apply torsion on his upper body. He'll be far less able to resist a throw."

judo,2z362p,bear-knuckle,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"You should be aware of it and aware that your partner doesn't want your sweat on them. If you find that during the course of class your sweaty chest is making contact with your partner's body (not gi), you should probably consider getting a rashguard. But in my experience, skin-to-skin contact doesn't happen much in judo. YMMV, especially if your club does heavy ne-waza."
judo,2z362p,Hippocampus88,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:16:25 2015 UTC,"I usually wear a simple white t-shirt under my gi for training. It soaks up some of the sweat so the gi won't get that nasty. Also prevents from some rashes, but I don't really care about that.  I could use some shin-guards though, as my shins are pretty much permanently yellow-brownish from those poor ashi-waza attempts."
judo,2z362p,Paladin_PDX,1 point,Sun Mar 15 09:33:14 2015 UTC,"I did judo without one and was usually fine. Sometimes I would get a little rash under my armpits or around my back. Then I started doing BJJ, after two practices my back and pits were completely raw from ""Rolling"" around on the ground for 2 hours.   moral of the story, lots of newaza and/or uchikomi merit a rashguard."
judo,2z362p,groteborsten,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"Not just newaza.  If you're uke for Korean morote uchikomi, you're going to want a rashie.  Your pits will be red raw after 20ish fits of them."

Besides, the ones I have have a habbit of rolling up over my stomach, which is quite uncomfortable, unless I tuck them into my underwear, which I suspect wouldn't be as effective a measure in Judo."

I like the comfort factor, and I find that it helps me go harder, longer during workouts.  Plus, I'm a sweaty son of a bitch, so NOT wearing a rash guard would end up up with me dripping on people. Which is disgusting."

judo,2z2fu9,hb187,3,Sat Mar 14 23:06:34 2015 UTC,"Ko-uchi-maki-komi is also a nice option, as the leg grab is a part of the throw itself (before the leg grabs being banned of course).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z53QFG915hs is a nice demonstration of some leg-grabs. I actually prefer the diagonal grabs, cause uke can't hook his leg.  Another combination to think about is, when you got the one handed leg grab going (straight and not diagonal), you can step in for o-uchi. This will not be as much action for you knee as standard o-uchi."

Throw a ko-uchi, then twist, keeping the lapel grip, and reach across your chest to grab the ankle you just reaped for a kibisu-gaeshi. It's a pretty sick throw. I like morote-gari more as a surprise move against a very judo-centric player, especially right as they reach for you."
judo,2z2fu9,SVPPB,2,Sat Mar 14 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"A similar one is deashi barai to kuchiki daoshi.  You sweep his foot, he lifts it out of the way, you grab the ankle and pull him down while you go down on one knee."
judo,2z2fu9,SVPPB,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:40:43 2015 UTC,"kibisu-gaeshi   Thanks, I didn't know the name for the judo equivalent of a single leg. I googled ko-uchi to kibisu-gaeshi and it showed the Kodokan Throwing Techniques combination - Although in that book, he keeps the lapel grip and rather than reaching across just goes right down with the sleeve grip for the ankle. I think I can try this next time we practice stand up. I guess solo drilling this would just be shadowing and visualization?  Edit: Actually there are a ton of ideas in this book."
judo,2z0ncp,fleischlaberl,5,Sat Mar 14 13:41:42 2015 UTC,Im a national amateur competitor in sumo and I have definitely noticed an improvement in the subtlety of my movements. Because in ama sumo after the initial charge bodies get locked up in a overunder position like Greco roman with both competitors having a strong low base. Therefore any movements into throws or trips can't just be forced through as that rarely works if ever. I have also noticed my balance has gotten better and my defensive base is as strong as ever. The timing and effectiveness of my trip game has also benefited.

judo,2z0ncp,bazzana,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"You tend to keep your weight centred and low and your feet planted during most of the fight that is kind of crucial or you are not gonna last long on the dohyo. Feet movement are similar to judo somewhat but u lift them off the ground even less generally. Psychologically, matches are so short that you have to make the right decision and go through with it  no second guessing. You make a mistake 9/10 you lose."

It is safe to assume though, that sumo played a little part in it as well. Young Kano  interviewed a sumo fighter, when he looked for a technique to defeat a strong, tall ""rival"" of his. The questioning remained fruitless in this specific case, but I would be surprised if Kano and his students didn't look into sumo at other occasions. The only example for Mifune's Daki Sutemi, a double belt grip throw, I know of, I found yesterday in a sumo video.  The sumo throw I-zori has been used in judo as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpPDYU2gGAY"

judo,2yzwpa,jonoy52,3,Sat Mar 14 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much this Tori is pulling you up, but generally speaking Tori should pull you up a bit. If the way this Tori is doing it though is hindering your ukemi then speak up about it, your both there to practise and to learn as much as possible so there  should be no worries in speaking up"
judo,2yzwpa,SVPPB,5,Sat Mar 14 10:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that pulling uke slightly is just common etiquette when you are doing uchikomi.   If I'm testing a throw I'm not wholly familiar with in uchikomi, and I accidentally go overboard and break uke's balance, I will try to keep him from hitting the mat too hard, help him up and keep working.  I don't see how a slight, controlled pull on the jacket or the sleeve might interfere with the breakfall.  Of course, if we are doing full-on nagekomi, I just throw like in randori.  On the other hand, the opposite problem is much more dangerous. There's a huge chubby white belt at my club (about 1.90 and 100 kg), who keeps clinging as uke. Whenever I throw him, he panics and holds on to whatever part of me he can on the way down. That's definitely a safety issue."

judo,2yzwpa,celluj34,2,Sat Mar 14 17:15:26 2015 UTC,If the tori is holding your sleeve then it might actually be aiding your break falling.  If they are holding up your weight more than that then it might be worth mentioning to your partner that you would find it easier to break fall if they let you go.

Firstly, she was no world beater even when she was actually doing judo full time.

judo,2yr0z0,anjodenunca,2,Thu Mar 12 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"Leg grabs; It's mostly political. Since Judo is an Olympic sport the IJFs want to segregate themselves from other sports like wrestling. Judo is not just ""jacket-wrestling"". The fact the greco-roman wrestling was suggested removed from the Olympics also gave them a scare, I think. So, they wanted to remove these leg grabs that produced a lot of bent-over strategies (not so differently that wrestling), with a lot of leg-based take-downs. They looked at statistics for the big signature Judo throws and noticed it was not as high as they wanted because people were hesitant of committing themselves, which exposes them to leg-grab counters. The new rules does indeed increase the statistics of good-posture stand-up big throws, but then again there are other concerns. But for the IJF it looks good on paper and TV, and that matters to them.  Ban on MMA cross-training for high-level competitors; The reason the IJF stand behind this rule is due to the differences in principle philosophy between the two. They don't want Judo to be ""tainted"" by MMAs brutal style. My theory is that the IJF is probably afraid that MMA can offer more money to the competitors, and are right to do so. In practice this would mean that top-level competitors, who are not by any means rich, would prefer the MMA event over an IJF-competition simply because it offers 5x the money. In the long haul this would be devastating for the sport.  I am not by any means defending these rules, I'm just saying that after being involved in politics for 7 years, I understand the politics related to it :)"

That's not to say you should never think about what your leg is doing, of course you should, but don't get caught up in it.  Far more important is the movement of your hips, they are where the reap begins and ensuring they 'snake' into position, getting in close and tight to your opponent,  quickly and effectively is what makes or breaks the throw."

This is essential for getting found in search results. Make sure you have a good image.   You know Facebook. Post at least once every few days, but really at least once a day is best. Constantly take pictures and tag your members in them on Facebook. Try to create a constant dialogue and get people talking publicly about your club or Judo in general. This will then become visible to their friends and potentially spread.  Try setting up an easy website with Wordpress if you have the time and funds. Keep it simple. It doesn't need to be fancy, just professional and straightforward. It's really not that hard to do Wordpress, and it is cheaper, but if you want to go really easy and are willing to pay a little extra you could try something like Squarespace.  I definitely like the idea of trying to create a relationship with the local BJJ gyms. From my experience there is a lot of intermingling there. You may also be able to try to create some type of relationship with other martial arts gyms.  For getting bodies in the door. Definitely do the standard offer of a free trial week.   Another idea off the top of my head is offering free self-defense seminars once a month or so. Post these free seminars on local community bulletin boards both online and physically at gathering spots. You can also leverage your relationships with surrounding martial arts schools by asking them to post your fliers for these on their bulletin boards. The seminars can cover some of the simple old school Judo self-defense techniques. Be sure to have someone take plenty of pictures (ask first) and let people know that they can find them on your Facebook.  The real trick is getting people to stay once they've come. The answer is creating a sense of community. You want people to feel welcome and comfortable. Try your best to create a dojo that is like a family. Take care of each other.

If they were to teach this technique saying that it is o soto gari, then i would take issue with that. teaching the technique under whatever name they call it? no problem here. do you get my point?"

Here you can see situations with side-landing with elbow that results in no score. Landing on the buttocks. The score, wazaari or yuko, depends on several factors. Example of kouchi-makikomi with buttocks landing (wazaari) vs. full-on back landing (ippon) can be seen under '06 - Difference Ippon Waza-aari' example #2 in the competition examples link. Bridge landings"
judo,2yrbxv,Ryvai,2,Thu Mar 12 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"A throw that includes all four aspects, labeled as force, speed, control, and landing largely on the back constitutes an Ippon. There is also something called super Ippon, the rules should be read up on that one with video examples, it's difficult to explain.  Waza ari includes landing largely on the back, but lacks some of the other aspects. So a throw where uki lands on their back but control was not maintained, or it lacked force, that is a waza ari. So osoto gari, where uki lands on his back, but butt first then rolls backwards due to force from tori or something like that, usually that gets a waza ari.  Hope this helps!"
judo,2yrbxv,MischaG,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! The original post was typed on mobile. Re-reading it, I wish I had edited it better.  The main point of contention was landing on your elbows. If you land mostly on your elbows rather than your back, does that eliminate the 'landing largely on the back' aspect? You still got thrown, but you're not doing a clean ukemi  because you don't want to lose the match.  We couldn't agree on what the letter of the rules were, only that it seemed against the spirit of judo to take a risk like that just to avoid losing."
judo,2yrbxv,MischaG,2,Thu Mar 12 05:10:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say necessarily it's against the spirit of judo, since people are able to turn out of throws as well and it's not frowned upon. There is, however, a danger with putting your elbows down. It happened in an international competition once, I forget who it was, but uki was being thrown and stuck his arm out, his arm snapped at the elbow. It's dangerous, and recent rules have made bridging through a throw to avoid falling on your back an automatic Ippon to encourage judoka not to do that, since they risk hurting their neck.  If they land on their elbows, I would mostly call it a waza ari. Of course once again, it all depends on different circumstances. I remember back in the day, landing on the butt with an arm extended to stay up was a yuko. Idealy, uki shouldn't be physically able to stop themself with an elbow if it were an Ippon throw, so that's why I would say waza ari. I would need to see a video of course of different circumstances to say exactly how I would call it, but that's my take on it"

judo,2yn2d7,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Wed Mar 11 03:30:34 2015 UTC,How does one get the rotation for uchi mata? Been trying to hit it in randori and i always manage to get the leg in but cant seem to get the rotation to finish it off? is it because i'm not getting enough kuzushi (always mindful to try and get it)
judo,2yn2d7,dermatix,3,Wed Mar 11 05:52:44 2015 UTC,"I am far from being an Uchi Mata expert, but as far as I understand the technique, there are multiple rotations involved (of which some happen at the same time or are linked to each other). For a classical, right sided Uchi Mata (Ashi Uchi Mata, sweeping up the inner left tigh with your right leg without real hip contact) you should lure uke into stepping forward with his left leg. If you position yourself correctly while doing this -""T-ing"" up-, you only have to turn by 90° further after that. It is important to take uke's upper body with you while you turn. Your right arm at his lapel may not fall behind.  When your right leg goes up, you upper body must go down. Your entire body, except for the leg you stand on (which should be slightly bent at the knee for more stability), works like a long lever. At the same time you must pull uke's right arm around you with your left arm. This pull must continue until uke falls!  For good examples of Uchi Mata, you may want to look into this video link list:  http://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/2qxal0/go_kyu_no_waza_second_set_video_list_the_good_the/  The List is in the comments, Uchi Mata comes 8th in the list."
judo,2yn2d7,MischaG,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:21:30 2015 UTC,"The ways I do Uchimata with some success, is the rotation comes from how you get your initial kuzushi. Same as Tai-Otoshi, (assuming you throw right sided), your left hand is gripping behind the elbow, your right is gripping the lapel. When you get your kuzushi, the right elbow stays on the same side as your right hand, but pushes up under the armpit. Your left hand pulls back and you turn your wrist to face you, don't drop your arm. This causes a lot of rotational momentum in the kuzushi itself.  The reap, a lot of people like to do it like the ending of an Osoto-gari reap, just with a straight leg and lifting it into your opponent. What I do, what I feel gives a lot more momentum to knock them over, is to kick kind of like a horse. Bend your leg first as you life it straight up, then kick back where you intend your leg to be as you straighten your left leg.  To finish the throw, simply rotate your upper body to face down towards the mat and since your elbow is in uki's armpit, they come along for the ride. Make sure to not leave your elbow behind your shoulder, as you'll lose a lot of power.  Hope this helps"

judo,2yn2d7,MischaG,2,Wed Mar 11 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"uchi-komi, lots and lots. Also, if you get another partner to stand behind uki and hold their belt down so you can't throw them, try your hardest to throw them anyway. When you practice, you should over-compensate with kuzushi because in competition, you never get quite as much as you do in practice. So if you over compensate and exaggerate the hand movements a little (not too much), it will help your competition throws in the long run"
judo,2yn2d7,geocattes,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:37:52 2015 UTC,Thank you for your help. Can I just ask - is there a reason that doing uchikomi rather than completing the throw will improve the kuzushi?
judo,2yn2d7,sawskankredemption,2,Wed Mar 11 14:57:20 2015 UTC,"Practice makes permanent.  because in Uchikomi, your opponent isn't resisting.  In randori/Shiai/Tournament they are. By overcompensating in Uchikomi you're actually arriving near the required exertion level to complete the said throw. and ofc, Throwing 100 times take a lot longer."

judo,2yn2d7,MischaG,2,Wed Mar 11 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"You need to work on judo from the ground up. Work on your footwork as well and make sure you are confident in the steps you are taking to get into a throw. Finishing the throw, although important, is pointless to learn unless you understand all of the fundamentals of entering into the throw itself.  In order to improve kuzushi, you can also take a bike tire tube, wrap it around a pole, and do fit-ins on there to help improve your pulling.  One very important point, kuzushi isn't about yanking your opponent off-balance. It should be gradual so that they still come off-balance, but they don't react to a jerking motion and stiffen up"
judo,2yn2d7,geocattes,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:50:46 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for explaining it. It's really helpful to know! :)
judo,2yn2d7,bigbaze2012,2,Wed Mar 11 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"I like to use resistance bands and wrap them around a tree or something and do uchi komi if you don't have a partner.   Also just a tip for sasae, make sure your arm with the collar grip lays on your opponents chest when you do kuzushi. Alot of beginners make the mistake of sticking their elbows out and this loses power."
judo,2yn2d7,geocattes,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:47:13 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm going to see if I do that with sasae!
judo,2yn2d7,geocattes,2,Wed Mar 11 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi is not an easy throw. You might want to look into these clip with Hiroshi Katanishi:  Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghIvAVb77Zg  Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so_DogUR-js  Here's a shorter clip with the same setup:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX40YVjaN7M  He feints an O Soto Gari Attack, then simultanously pulls him by his left shoulder, pushes him on his right elbow and blocks the foot to throw. It is a form of Hando no Kuzushi, meaning it is Kuzushi making use of a conter reaction by uke: The feint creates counter pressure which is used to unbalance uke.  You can use the same principle in many ways for other throws."
judo,2yn2d7,geocattes,2,Wed Mar 11 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clips. :) Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi is also one of the throws I have to do for the yellow belt test, so I want to practise it more. I'm going to try this set up :)"

judo,2yn2d7,MMonReddit,2,Wed Mar 11 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's okay, because the way I was taught throws to my right side. I'll double check, though. Even more thanks! :)"

Some of our tatami are getting old and hard because replacing them isn't really an affordable option. When I'm getting thrown by a 260lb man who is landing on top of me, I want my mats to be softer than the concrete underneath.  I'm wondering if any of you have had any success raising money for your clubs, or if you have any good ideas.  Mats are pretty expensive!"
judo,2yn2d7,MMonReddit,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that gathering money may be something your form of organization may not do or has to pay taxes for.  Funds can be raised in form of donations, dojo sales (think yard sale), a tombola or via sponsors for example.   A public demonstration may include well coreographed techniques, single throws, squences, mock randori, kata, self defense demos, spectacular ukemi etc... Combine this with selling coffe, soft drinks, self baked cake and cookies to the audience. You can also ask for donations and even attract new members.  Dojo sales could work like a yard or garage sale or flea market. Ask members to look through their stuff they'd be interested in selling and putting a percentage on each item they are willing to donate to the dojo. A tombola could work in a similar way. Members and their families could donate stuff and other members can buy raffle tickets  to win these items. If your judoka appear in public often, at local tournaments for example, you may attract a sponsor (think of group t-shirts or hoodies with the logo of your sponsor on it)."
judo,2yn2d7,MMonReddit,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:21:12 2015 UTC,"How long does it usually take to advance from white belt? I googled a bit but I couldn't find vary precise answers (e.g. many places said 6 months, but they didn't list how many times or hours per week or month). If it helps, I am a blue belt in jiu jitsu; I got promoted maybe  3 months ago now. I only do one judo class per week (after a takedowns / jiu jitsu class wherein we start standing and drill standing grappling, so that includes judo but certainly isn't focused on it). But I want to know generally how long it takes as well."
judo,2yn2d7,counterpig,2,Thu Mar 12 05:10:26 2015 UTC,"The reason you find varying answers is, that it actually varies from country to country, from federation to federation and even from instructor to instructor. And also you personal progress of course. Normal are 6 months to one year for white belt to yellow belt for example."

judo,2yn2d7,silvaphysh13,1 point,Fri Mar 13 07:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a big guy and I tend to do this a lot as well albeit accidentally. The short answer is no, If you do this you're not really learning anything. If the person is significantly shorter than you practice footsweeps or other ashi waza for which brute strength isn't that helpful. If nothing else it'll get you more accustomed to moving around the mat.  Randori is about experimenting with new throws and learning what it feels like to have people try and throw you, not winning."
judo,2yn2d7,fleischlaberl,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"Do you really learn anything if you just outmuscle your opponents?  What will happen when you come up against someone of equal strength?  I love getting thrown.  I can feel the subtle differences between partners; the way they step, pull, push, lift, etc.  Then I try to incorporate those things that really seem to work in my practice."
judo,2yn2d7,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:49:58 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself this:  Why are you doing Randori?  Do you just want to win? Or do you want to learn? Because I guarantee there's people out there who are bigger than you and stronger than you, who also move like a panther and have many years of expertise behind them. And you don't get to their level without learning how to perform the skills, and not just by bundling people over.  You have a couple hours a few times a week at your judo club. Isn't it better to spend that time learning and practicing your skills?  I wrote a long response to what was pretty much this exact question recently - I'm too lazy (maximum efficiency!) to type out the details, so: http://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/2xn504/as_a_light_weight_this_is_what_randori_can_feel/cp32cgh?context=3"
judo,2yn2d7,dzendian,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"Well, the more time you spent on using muslce only, the less time you spent on actually trying judo. In other words you are just wasting your time instead of learning and for what?"
judo,2yn2d7,NeuroCore,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"So, my first question after reading this is, why is there pain involved? If you're getting hurt in randori, you should tell your partner(s) to give you better support. The point of randori is not to annihilate your partner with big throws, but to practice your techniques in a random and dynamic way. As a big dude myself (270 lb) I run into a similar problem, and I think for people like us good ukemi is absolutely critical. If you don't worry about getting hurt from being thrown, it lends a lightness to your style of judo that will discourage smaller players from working too hard to slam you."
judo,2yn2d7,dzendian,1 point,Thu Mar 12 07:55:03 2015 UTC,"Bit of an odd question here, I've noticed that I tend to be quite a slow starter.

Any tips on getting into my judo groove on faster?"

Common tricks that you see at competition are:  Listening to music through earphones, right up to the point where the referee calls you onto the mat.  Slap yourself in the face/chest/ears/thighs before going onto the mat.  Take a whiff of smelling salts before going onto the mat."
judo,2yn2d7,lostMartinet,3,Wed Mar 11 12:38:32 2015 UTC,"I've had a similar problem in shiai, and right before my first match, I like to have a buddy grab me by the lapels and basically violently yank my gi in different directions. Helps take away that initial shock of someone latching on."

judo,2yn2d7,NeuroCore,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:39:33 2015 UTC,"Why haven't I been promoted yet?    Hear me out (not complaining):  I started the first week of January, and I've been at 3 classes per week, 2 hours per.  I have previous judo experience (about 3 years), and one semester of BJJ from when I was in college.  I have the best attendance in the class, by far.  I'm always there I don't skip warmups (a lot of people do).  Yet, in the past two weeks, I've seen people that have joined the club after I have, asked to wear a white belt (like I was), and have much worse attendance than myself are getting handouts from the sensei where he will say ""study this"", and it's the green belt test requirements.  I have not gotten that at all.  The syllabus says that time from green to white is 3 months (or less if you compete).  I have not competed for this dojo, mainly because I'm still trying to get my cardio up to levels that please me.  I'm NOT wanting to collect belts like crazy, but I'm not allowed to do any arm locks or sacrifice throws until I'm a brown belt, so this is motivating me.  I feel like I can't use all of the judo that I did learn and that bothers me.  I feel like I'm playing chess with just pawns when the other person playing me can use all of the pieces.  Other than some default answers of: ""maybe you're just not very good"" or ""you're overthinking it"" or ""man up"", can we maybe come up with some answers to this... perhaps things that I can work on?

Perhaps your instructor is mainly concerned with duty of care stuff but it sounds overly cautious to me, especially if you're intending to compete.

judo,2ylpy6,porl,7,Tue Mar 10 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like to answer a few of the misinterpretations in this thread. What he literally says and what message he tries to put out can easily be misinterpreted. Here is my understanding of what he said;   Bas is just saying that many of the techniques in Judo is not easily applicable in MMA due to the fact that the opponent is slippery and the risk vs. award is not worth it. Ending up in a bad position can get you knocked out. He also states that while some flashy techniques, like shoulder-throws (e.g. seoi-nage) does work, you have to be someone like Karo Parisyan to pull it off. Basically he is saying that those techniques work, but needs a high degree of expertise. He mentions that the submissions Judo brings to MMA is not very different from other martial arts, e.g. submission wrestling, BJJ, and so on. This is probably due to the fact that only no-gi submissions are applicable. At the end he says that he likes certain aspects of Judo, particularly the ankle picks.    I like to point out that Judo does bring certain variations to the table. Ronda Rousey's Juji-gatame, in itself, is not by any means spectacular technical-wise, but her ability to put almost anyone in a position to take advantage of it is unique. I've seen plenty of UFC footage where I clearly see obvious openings for techniques that does not require a gi, rarely seen in the UFC, but is mainstream in Judo. The reason we don't see them very often is not neccecarily because they don't work, it's just that not many high-level Judoka are engaging in MMA. That might change and we will see more of them.  Harai-goshi and foot-sweeps are vastly popular in MMA, people just don't usually link them to Judo. A Judo player has VASTLY greater expertise in these techniques, so that is a huge advantage in the ring. Just look at Ronda Rousey's arsenal."

It was at a very legit gym with good players, it was basically no-gi grappling. I was able to use most of the throws I learned very effectively, I didn't have a huge issue throwing without the gi. I would very often get sumi gaishi, kouchi ouchi, ogoshi, harai ogoshi, and kata guruma.  I did to make a few adjustments with my grips (overhooks underhooks, head and arm opposed to collar and sleeve), but after I played around with it a bit it came natural.   My biggest grievance was what judo did not prepare me for. I wasn't taught to sprawl so anyone with even a shitty double leg could take me down. I had no idea what do when someone took my back, often resulting in the full on body slam. Didn't know how to do any joint locks with the legs, when I had a leg I would usually let it go and reset.   I feel if someone put in an effort to making a no gi judo class it could be very successful. The material is there, the will is currently not."
judo,2ylpy6,anjodenunca,5,Wed Mar 11 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"That's part of it, though I think marketing and name recognition plays a role too. The Gracies established the dominance of strong ne waza and because of that people wanting to do mma will pick BJJ if given the choice between the two.  BJJ comes from kosen judo so if they had called their art kosen judo or if they called it Brazilian judo or even jiu-do then you'd probably have a lot of guys seeing it on TV and going to judo dojos to learn because it sounds close to their ears. I mean, judoka could take off their GI tops and do the same thing as BJJ guys if they want to."

How BJJ has developed in the later years, and where they have taken their inspiration from over time is probably from many places, but my point was it's origins in Maeda's 'Kodokan Judo'. Many BJJers are resisting this fact like a stubborn child instead of embracing it. I really don't understand the hesitation. It's just history?"

Uhm, greco-roman wrestling has it's roots from the ancient Greek Olympics. Sambo was created by Viktor Spiridonov and Vasili Oshchepkov in the 1920's and also has roots from Judo. Oshchepkov studied Judo in Japan under Shihan Kano Jigoro himself. You label Judoka by saying 'most' Judo guys are like children saying that BJJ is just like Judo, which is simply not true.

judo,2ylpy6,JumboReverseShrimp,2,Wed Mar 11 02:34:27 2015 UTC,Depends on your philosophy. Many high-level practitioners hate berimbolo's because they don't 'work' in a real fight or aren't 'street-realistic'. The Gracies take this stance :)

Better to say which Gracie's you mean.  I think the arguments against stuff like berimbolos is a little silly tbh. If you are teaching them to white belts then sure. But things like a berimbolo is an effective way of getting the upper hand against another highly skilled Bjj practioner. You are not gonna pull them off unless you already have a decent grappling foundation.

Second, BJJ'er train No-Gi and a Judoka who doesn't train in No-Gi will have a really hard time without any grips. Leg sweeps/picks work great.  Third,Throwing some body could leave you open to getting knocked out. This why not alot of fighters have a Judo base in MMA.  Fourth, the level of ground work in BJJ is so much better for self-defence & MMA over newaza. There's just a higher level & BJJ'er train blocking strikes which judo doesn't.  I train both and love them but you have to understand MMA is a different game. Thinking you have an idea and knowing is to different things"

I dunno, if I'm in a self defense situation, transitioning to the ground is the last thing I'm going to want to do as it pretty much kills my ability to make an opening and escape fast. The utility (and crucially the legal implications) of standing techniques in self defense seems a far more important consideration if choosing a martial art for that use."
judo,2ylpy6,jimplaysdnd,2,Wed Mar 11 11:09:55 2015 UTC,"That's a true and often not considered point.   Pins and fighting for a superior position are probably more applicable to self defense than submissions.  To a layman (like the judge and prosecutor), you can explain away pinning someone, or even punching them into submission.  A choke carries a different connotation, especially after Eric Garner.  An armbar... How do you explain it to the judge?   ""...So I attained a dominant position, sat on top of him and then managed to grab his arm. He continued to resist, so I broke it."""

Secondary should be to chock him out from the bottom if its one vs one or sweep end up on top and chock him. Third should be your last thing to do is break his arm or leg (top or bottom) or throw strikes from mount and get out of there. I have been in a fight were i knee bar the attacker because he was bigger so I ended the fight by breaking his leg that was the last thing I wanted to do but in a fight everything is different strikes,grips,size,etc"

I don't want to use unnecessary force.  I don't want to be sprawling around on the ground.  The ground is the last place I want to be.  If I do end up on the ground somehow,  I want to stand and run,  not try causing injury.  At most I want to pin my attacker until someone can get the police."

I advice them to fight properly and tell them, that they can only attack from an upright position.  If they are not willing to learn, and I still have to do randori with them in lack of other partners (or being in shiai of course), I just take a big step back and send them face first into the mat. In randori, they learn that landing on their backs is more comfortable and in shiai they get a shido (if you do it the right way).  As you are an orange belt, it shouldn't be your job to teach others. Have a talk with your trainer that you are annoyed."

We basically try and snap them down - grip the collar and sleeve, open your arms (flare your elbows) and then snap them downwards, bringing your elbows together. Make sure their head doesn't smash into your face as you do so.  We've got a couple of sequences off this - snap down all the way, snap down twice and then go for a ko-uchi as they straighten up. I've also experimented with an over the shoulder belt grip and hip throwing off that. Another idea is sumi gaeshi off the georgian grip. Easy to get this grip because he's bent over and ofc in judo he can't just double leg you.  See what works for you.  If the guy faceplants you can always take his back and work newaza if you feel confident with this.  Ofc, people in this thread telling you that this is bad judo form are entirely correct."

judo,2ylct9,fleischlaberl,3,Tue Mar 10 22:25:54 2015 UTC,"Very gooood question ;-)  Head down with stiff arms forward is a very weak position. Even as an orange belt - as the thread opener - there are a lot of techniques. First - its very easy to move the opponent/partner, if he takes such a weak position. You can take a sleeve/high collar grip easily and move the opponent with steps backward and circular steps. You are in a complete dominant position. Early beginners have troubles, because they learned some osoto gari, o goshi and seio nage and are completly focused on this throws and have some static pictures in their mind, how these throws work. But Judo is an open mind in movement and the movement comes from the feet, the legs and the middle (hara). Tai sabaki (body movement) is the key.  ."
judo,2ylct9,bear-knuckle,2,Tue Mar 10 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"Because the low stance is purely defensive. If their legs aren't underneath them, they can't enter for throws - well, they can, but they'll be telegraphed and thus countered. If a judoka takes this stance, he has no opportunity to mount any offense, which means he's not actually trying anything, which means he's not actually learning. He's just stalling, and frankly, I value my mat time too much to spend an extra minute or whatever creating an opening. It's suboptimal for me and useless for him.  It's like if a basketball player was so nervous about keeping the ball that he didn't dribble, didn't move - just curled up with the ball so no one else could take it. No one on that team is benefitting from that."

Feeling the tatami was probably a big motivation factor for me to get back into training. Some boundaries I probably stretched a bit too far at times. It was a bit silly of me, but I even did a tai-otoshi with my soft-cast on (shh, don't tell the doctor). After some pain here and there on the tatami during recovery-time the leg became stronger and stronger each day, but my ankle is now stronger than ever before with no complications. I'm glad I came back to the tatami as soon as I was able. Don't go too soon though, listen to your body.   Were you afraid of getting hurt after returning?; At first I was very cautious, gradually experimenting. I tried not to be afraid, but it could sense my self hesitating. Instead I focused on techniques that did not involve too-much ankle-sweeps. I also took the opportunity to develop my kenka-yotsu stance, defending my weak ankle in the back-lines. At some point, perhaps after I removed the screws that was in place, I began trusting it again and now i see it as one of the strongest weapons at my disposal. Regain trust in that part of your body is very important.  How did you overcome the fear of sustaining the same or another horrible injure?; Plenty of times! But that was only when I was still recovering. I think it's a good strategy to strengthen that part of your injured body to the point where you see it's counterpart (the other ankle in this case) as the weakest link, further motivating you to train it even more. I think at this point I'm not afraid anymore, I see it as one of the strongest part of my body now.  Right now I am back in the same boat as you again though. 5 weeks ago I suffered a type-3 clavicle dislocation in my shoulder during a snowboard accident, which resulted in surgery. They say it will take at least 7 more weeks until I can lift something heavy, but expect a full recovery. It sucks big time! I'm confident that i'll return to the tatami as soon as I am able, but it will be a painful process to recovery. My doctor has told me to not use a sling, unless absolutely necessary. It will be very painful, he said, but the recovery time will be shorter and movement should return faster. My love for Judo and the willingness to return to the tatami is what drives me. Without it I would probably be sitting at home eating nutella, which is bad, unless it's on someone's booty."

Currently have had a set of ""unknown"" injuries that I got from my first competition on the 22nd.  I haven't been able to see a doctor or get any x-rays yet, which is why I say unknown, but a rib injury which is definitely not just a bruise, a shoulder injury, and a wrist injury.    Most rib injuries seem to say a good 6 weeks is needed for recovery but I am going crazy here."
judo,2yku58,newhoza,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"Had similar injury on a tournament. It won't be ""like nothing ever happens"", I believe it is more or less permanent. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it requires a supporting bandage, but nothing too bad. My response to this is paying more attention to position I'm in, being light on my feet and not fighting the good throw when I'm missing one - pretty much what I had to do from the very beginning. If I'd follow those rules I'd never had this injury in a first place."
judo,2yku58,berest,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"I had a similar injury, but it was before judo. In high school I tore my ACL, MCL, and meniscus playing football. If I could do it over again I would regularly visit the physical therapist to make sure that my muscles grew back and I could retain range of motion. Right now (even 7 or 8 years later) my left leg is noticeably weaker than my right, and I have relatively frequent pains when I do more than just run. It doesn't stop me, but I am always thinking about it. These things just happen, and it sucks. I hope you can do better, and good luck!"

judo,2yin0d,fleischlaberl,5,Tue Mar 10 12:13:55 2015 UTC,"Certified Regional Referee here.  It is illegal to go into matwork without a clear attempt at a throw. So if you go into a tomoenage that is clearly not designed to throw them over, you will receive a false attack shido. At least in USJF, they are getting very strict over these rules and will give a shido to what was demonstrated in the video because it is clearly not a designed attack to get a point from a throw, but rather it is an illegal transition to matwork, which will result in a matte and a shido for tori"
judo,2yin0d,MischaG,2,Tue Mar 10 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"Could you help me out on this one?  Is the USJF using the IJF rules, or do they have their own subset?  Either way, could you link up to the rules or at least give the # of the section you are referring to?  I may need this info in the future.  Thanks!  edit I guess what I am getting at is that Article 16, section 2 d of the IJF RULES 2011-2012 directly contradict what you just said above.    http://www.intjudo.eu/editor_up/up/IJF%20REF%20RULES_Final%20print%20vers_2011-12_ENG_Final_amended.pdf  Is there a newer version you can point us to that shows that this is no longer the case?  edit edit Found the current rules on another site.  http://judopedia.com/index.php/International_Judo_Federation_%28Refereeing_Rules_-_2014-2016%29    It's still there.

judo,2yin0d,DysonMachine,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much.  So would flying juji be legal, because it is a recognized technique?"
judo,2yin0d,MischaG,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:16:49 2015 UTC,"There are different rules about it, a lot aren't specified very well. Flying juji is still allowed in USJF, since, to my understanding, if uki is to land on his back when tori still has control, it can result in a score from a throw. However, with these attacks shown in the video where it almost directly leads to guard, those are not allowed in judo.  The desired direction that they want to take with these rules is to make judo a more spectator friendly sport. That is why they did away with leg picks because too many people were bad at them and it led to matwork, which led to nothing, to standing back up into another leg pick.  False attacks are also going on a broader spectrum. Not only with drop seionage anymore, but also with tomoenage, certain footsweeps/blocks (like this one), and a few other throws that are meant to not throw the opponent, but more to halt the action into a stalemate."
judo,2yin0d,rjgreen85,2,Tue Mar 10 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"This all sounds like an arbitrary interpretation.  What throw is uke counter-throwing tori with during a flying armbar? Daki age?   The leg picks were taken out because of the resemblance to wrestling.   The above attack is not a 'false' attack. There's no stalemate.   I'm wondering if USJF's rulebook differs from USA Judo/IJF?   I personally discussed the legality of this specific technique at length with the referee emeritus of the PJC at our state games in November, and I'm parroting what he told me, which is also what the rules state?"
judo,2yin0d,MischaG,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"Judo refereeing is arbitrary. It's not like refereeing fencing or any other martial art that has a scoring system of ""it hit or it didn't"", any call is up to the referee's discretion as long as the jury agrees with it. A throw can be an ippon to one person, a yuko to another. It depends on the interpretation, which is arbitrary.  Above, there is no intention of getting uki on their back. This is for the intention of going straight into matwork without the immediate use of an armlock, like waki-gatame or hara-gatame from nage-waza is allowed to transition to ne-waza even though there is no throw present. This, however, is a false attack."
judo,2yin0d,rjgreen85,3,Wed Mar 11 02:10:34 2015 UTC,this is why our sport is dying.
judo,2yin0d,rjgreen85,2,Wed Mar 11 03:50:19 2015 UTC,and you're still wrong.
judo,2yin0d,MischaG,0,Wed Mar 11 03:51:14 2015 UTC,"Alright, I may be wrong. It's a terrible looking attack and honestly, I hope I never see it in competition. It looks dangerous to the knee, it doesn't look like it requires any skill whatsoever, and IJF tries to keep judo from being like other sports, but yet they allow this when it's basically Ju-Jitsu. I don't agree with many things IJF changes and allows nowadays. So I may still be wrong, but it's an attack that I, if I were refereeing the match, would initially call a false attack to."
judo,2yin0d,MischaG,2,Wed Mar 11 04:03:48 2015 UTC,Did you look at the gifs that rjgreen85 posted? I think that the attack looks very impressive. He takes his opponent from standing to submitting within seconds.
judo,2yin0d,rjgreen85,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:06:41 2015 UTC,I had not before I commented. I looked at the video and based my opinions off of that
judo,2yin0d,MischaG,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:31:40 2015 UTC,So you're butthurt.
judo,2yin0d,rjgreen85,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"What? I admitted that according to the IJF rules, I'm wrong. However, as according with my earlier statement, in my opinion, it is a false attack. I think it should still be a false attack. Are you really that hyped over being the one who needs to know everything, and even when I admit that I'm wrong, you still poke at it?  I'm wrong, but I still don't like the move. I've done judo since I learned how to walk, I'm allowed to have an opinion. Sorry you constantly feel the need to be above people that you simply can't be nice to somebody who disagrees with you. Maybe when you get a black belt and are certified to teach people, you can learn that other people have different opinions from you. But all I see is some self righteous child who is pointless to argue with. Have fun winning against white belts who are the only ones who will fall for this move but when you're ready to fight the big boys, let me know."
judo,2yin0d,rjgreen85,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:02:33 2015 UTC,"Dude, even if you don't like the move it's not a false attack.   False attacks are feigned throw attempts to circumvent the noncombativity penalties for stalling and such, like spamming bad drop seois or just kicking at shins and such.   I don't have a problem with you disliking the move, I have a problem with you misconstruing it and flying armbar as 'illegal' - by citing the wrong penalty no less - all because you don't like it.   It doesn't matter if I'm right, what matters is that we've got a duty to enforce the rules as written regardless of whether or not we like them. Not make up bullshit leaps in logic to justify our prejudice.   As for that second paragraph, respect is a two-way street. Your black belt entitles you to nothing. Read what you wrote one more time and tell me if you think that's how a black belt should act?"

judo,2yin0d,judokalinker,3,Tue Mar 10 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"No, it is illegal in competition to take someone down for the sake of getting them to the mat, without attempting a recognized throw. This is why you can just use wrestling arm drags to take people down and pin them easily. Ask me how I know :("
judo,2yin0d,audiaudioxenfree,2,Tue Mar 10 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"How do you know?  But flying juji is still legal, isn't it? Is that the only standing submission that is allowed?"
judo,2yin0d,audiaudioxenfree,3,Tue Mar 10 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"The ""ask me how I know"" was rhetorical. He has probably been penalized for it.  Flying armbars are under the classification of skillful takedowns, which are legal.   You would be better off trying this off of a Tomoe nage."
judo,2yin0d,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:15:32 2015 UTC,"I started playing judo in 2008, when I was a senior on a competitively ranked college wrestling team. Being brand new to Judo, I of course started with a white belt, but I was able to throw anyone short of a competitive black belt with kata-guruma (it was legal then), as it is nearly 100% the same technique in judo competition as it is in wrestling. Those that I didn't set up with the throw I would simply let try to throw me and then get on top and pin them. I then got the brilliant idea to just arm drag them to the ground and pin them, but I was quickly penalized."
judo,2yin0d,porl,-1,Tue Mar 10 20:46:24 2015 UTC,I didn't say standing submissions weren't allowed. This one cleary isn't standing.
judo,2yin0d,Hippocampus88,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:17:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what I meant is transitioning from standing directly into a submission without attempting to throw them."
judo,2yin0d,-Fabiow,2,Tue Mar 10 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"This is perfectly legal under competition rules. It is defined as 'skillful entry into ne-waza'. However, if the attempt is poor, e.g. it looks like you just fall down to the mat, then you might receive shido. However, if it is correctly executed and it's clearly visible for the referee that you are attempting an technique, it's allowed."
judo,2yin0d,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:48:54 2015 UTC,Definitely.
judo,2yin0d,judokalinker,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"I prefer to do it with a half-assed tomoe-nage.  It doesn't take uke down as nicely as this ""kick"", but won't get me a shido right away if it doesn't work."
judo,2yix02,JYJS,5,Tue Mar 10 04:25:43 2015 UTC,"Cauliflower ear can be avoided by just taking some time off if your ears start to hurt a lot.  The only people I've seen with cauliflowering are those who compete at a very high level and are constantly training. It's because these folks can't afford to slow down due to tournament schedules, etc.  You will probably develop cauliflowering around the same time you are flying around the world to compete in Internatonal tournaments. So don't worry about it."
judo,2yix02,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,2,Tue Mar 10 09:59:31 2015 UTC,"I know some top-athletes in the clubs I train in with cauliflower ear and some who don't. Mostly it comes from excessive ground fighting.  As a hobby judoka there needs to be A LOT of bad luck to get those, as it is a result of a series of injuries.  And even if you got severe ear injury and it swells with blood (that's where the cauliflower ears come from), just go to a surgeon and get it treated with an incision.  But take my word for it, you won't come across this as a hobby Judoka."
judo,2yix02,Hippocampus88,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:53:07 2015 UTC,Don't need an incision. They can just drain it with a syringe. I've had it done twice and so only have a very small bit of cauli you can't even see
judo,2yix02,qwak,2,Tue Mar 10 13:22:22 2015 UTC,"It's not enough to just drain it. Pressure also need to be put on the ""void"". I used a sort of clamp on my ear with cotton to keep pressure on it for a while, from doctors advice. Otherwise it will just fill up with fluids again. Speaking from experience :)"
judo,2yix02,Ryvai,2,Tue Mar 10 15:05:53 2015 UTC,Yeah they packed it too. I was only speaking about the need for an incision
judo,2yix02,qwak,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:14:31 2015 UTC,"what you describe is not state of the art, as it tends to build up again. standard procedure is incision + pressure bandage. source: I'm learning for my med exam right now."
judo,2yix02,Hippocampus88,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"You should be fine man, as you aren't taking major strikes (kicks and punches) to the ears like in many other combat sports. But I think there are a few who wear headgear just in case. Most people are cool though and won't give a shit if you do wear gear."
judo,2yix02,bear-knuckle,3,Tue Mar 10 04:38:57 2015 UTC,Grapplers usually get more cauli than strikers because strikers wear headgear during sparring. No one in my boxing club had cauliflower ear. 2/3 of my BJJ gym does.
judo,2yix02,judokalinker,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"I still have no cauliflower, and no one in my club does, even the highest ranking members. You can definitely wear headgear if you are worried about it."

judo,2yix02,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:56:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say every high level competitor has cauliflower ear that i've noticed.   Personally, I've had a few cases where it would feel bruised for a few weeks then go down but it hasn't really flared up."
judo,2yix02,infernalspacemonkey,1 point,Tue Mar 10 09:36:29 2015 UTC,"Cauliflower ear will occur anytime there's repetitive trauma to the ear. Even if you get it, you can drain it with a small needle syringe.  The only reason people have it is either a) ignorance or b) they want to look 'tough'."
judo,2yix02,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Mar 10 14:48:25 2015 UTC,When I was doing greco-roman wrestling when I was younger our trainers used to rub our ears and tell us you're not a real wrestler until you have cauliflower ears. Absolutely terrible!
judo,2yix02,registeredexpert,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:08:01 2015 UTC,"I got cauliflower ear about 6 months after starting judo, and  again about 3 months after that. From not being smart enough to take a break when my ears started hurting.  I'm the only one in our dojo who gets them, but I've seen some pretty mangled ears out there. Some people are more susceptible to them than others I guess.  I picked up some ear guards online that I wear during randori and it works great. But even the children make fun of me."
judo,2yix02,Machcharge,0,Sun Mar 22 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"There aren't any strikes in judo so you don't have to worry about those, and it's almost impossible to land on your ear after a throw if you've done break fall training at all. It's nothing to worry about, I don't wear it, many people do not wear it and still have intact ears. I wouldn't recommend it due to its gaudiness."
judo,2yix02,02-6611-0142-1,5,Tue Mar 10 04:47:17 2015 UTC,"You can still get cauliflower ear, the initial damage usually comes from having your ear folded while you drag your head against something, escaping tight chokes is a common cause.  It's not a big deal though, if you ever get cauliflower ear symptoms, just go to your doctor and get him to drain it. But do it quickly, you want to do it within 24 hours if possible. If you leave it a few days it hardens, but if you get it drained early your ear will look the same.  If that's not feasible, you can learn to drain it yourself at home with syringes, but I wouldn't recommend it."
judo,2ygieh,LegiticusMaximus,2,Mon Mar 9 17:03:01 2015 UTC,Do you ever just turn around and go straight backwards with a ouchi gari? Its pretty effective if they are leaning back hard to avoid the throw.
judo,2ygieh,themoneybadger,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"Once in a while, but it sounds like I need to do it more often.  Do you just turn or should I have a small hop inwards, too?  Rather than doing the super deep uchi mata where my hips are right in line with theirs, I typically have my hips slightly more to one side."
judo,2ygieh,themoneybadger,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:01:14 2015 UTC,yea I kind of turn and hopefully just use their momentum against them.  I struggle with all of the leg trips bc im really short but this was has worked for me.
judo,2ygieh,nexquietus,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"The hardest part can be making sure you land in good grappeling position, as much of the time you land in between their legs, and if you are doing this for BJJ, that could suck.  Just make sure you are on the move when you hit the mat.  My brother and I did this quite often when we were competing in Judo.  It's a good combo."
judo,2ygieh,Ryvai,2,Mon Mar 9 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"There is also the infamous uchimata/ouchi-gari feint to tani-otoshi. Sumi-gaeshi is also used a lot after the leg is lifted (you can see Ronda Rousey likes this technique), but then again we are now diving into the realm of sacrifice throws :)"

judo,2ygieh,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:55:16 2015 UTC,What is the first one?  They pull their leg back towards their other leg to avoid the ouchi-gari and then you go into tani otoshi?
judo,2ygieh,TCamilo19,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"Matt describes the general principle midway in this video, I could not find an exact example, but this is generally the idea, just more forcefully. You want that reaction :)"

judo,2ygieh,silvaphysh13,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"The things you listed are pretty good, I'd keep working on them.  This is probably going to be hard to describe, but I like to combine uchimata with a variation of sumi-gaeshi. When you swing your attacking leg backwards, but not enough to throw them or the throw just fails, hook the inside of their far leg, with the 'laces' of your attackin leg touching the back of their knee, then rotating back the way you came as you go to the ground, use the foot as leverage to control them and flip them over.   Pretty awful description sorry, I'm on mobile so can't like to a vid, will do when I get home if I remember. It works better from an unorthodox grip, same side or Russian style typically."
judo,2ygieh,vipchicken,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:24:19 2015 UTC,This! I've never managed to actually pull that trick off in practice but I've loved it since we got taught it about a year ago. Although the version I learned was hooking the leg on the side you tried to sweep. Going for the other one makes a lot of sense though.

It would be helpful to tell us at how long you have been studying Judo, as that would be give us some perspective. When it comes to 'not feeling ready' I would listen to your sensei and trust in his expertise and belief in you. Perhaps you actually are at a green belt level, and it is unfair of you to wear the orange belt. Be honored by your sensei's wishes and accept the promotion, but earn it and pass with flying colors. He would probably not advice you to grade unless he has already seen that you can do it."

For technical there is no competitive aspect but the technical standard the applicant is held to is much much higher. Some people think this is lesser somehow.  If this guy was promoted to first dan some other way then it's not an official grade.   Technical is probably a more realistic route to 1st Dan as someone starting late but if you're still fit and healthy no-one is stopping you.

judo,2ycqaj,jimplaysdnd,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:37:22 2015 UTC,time in grade is something like 6 months to 1 year from 1st kyu to 1st dan. you can accumulate your 100 points in that year or do a line up.   promotion by line up consists of beating 5 people with ippon on the same day at a grading event. you get two or three prelim fights with a break in between and if you qualify for the line up you have to beat three guys by ippon without a break in between. if you fail the line up but get points they go into your cumulative score and still count towards 1st dan.
judo,2ycqaj,dave_attenburz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 08:44:33 2015 UTC,"Doing the lineup was one of the most intense, and most rewarding, things I've done. It's definitely a trial by fire. Back in the day though the BJA had a fairly easy theoretical component (no kata until 3rd dan, for example) - no idea if it's still the same - I'm no longer in the UK - but I did feel that although I was on point competitively my knowledge of Judo was probably a little limited. Hopefully I've changed that now!"

judo,2ycqaj,Kosoto_Gake,2,Tue Mar 10 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"While I cannot speak for the UK, the Masters (30+) judo competition categories are very active here in Australia.  This being said however, in Australia at least, competition points from Masters competition cannot be used towards grading.  Instead, competition points need to be achieved through Senior (16+) competition, where there is no exclusion of available competitors - This does make things harder for us older judoka who are lining up in shiai with guys who are in their prime and fighting for National selection, but all the more satisfying when we can prove that age and treachery can overcome youth and skill."
judo,2ycqaj,iambob4ever,3,Mon Mar 9 03:01:19 2015 UTC,"35 is not too old to compete.   There's a first kyu at my club in his fifties who just got his first 10 points towards his shodan recently and we have loads of guys in their fourties who compete.   I'm biased but I advise sticking to the BJA and not the BJC. The BJC are too traditional and narrow minded in my opinion and have inferior competitors.   If you train hard it is theoretically possible to get your shodan in 18 months but you'd likely have to train everyday for that. We've got people who've been brown belts for years as well though.   Train hard and don't worry about the belts too much, if you do it solely for that reason then you're never going to make it to black anyway."
judo,2ycqaj,beambeam1,2,Mon Mar 9 13:17:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know how the British do it but for shodan (1st degree black) in Canada you need 120 points, 30ish of them need to be from competition. Honestly seems pretty crazy, anyone who get's a black belt any other way then performing the Syllabus + points is bullshit."
judo,2ycqaj,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:55:32 2015 UTC,Its actually 40 points. This only applies if you under the age of 21.

Where do your kids train judo? Perhaps someone here could recommend you a great local club?  I find given that you already have the skills in one martial art, you should pick up a black belt in judo in no time in the right environment. My own mother from sitting on the sidelines watching me and my brothers was eventually able to get hers in a year at about the same age as you are now!"
judo,2ycqaj,Kosoto_Gake,2,Sun Mar 8 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"Judo and karate aren't even similar to each other, suggesting that it'll be easier to improve in judo because of a karate background is ludicrous.   There's not a chance that is true regarding your mother if it was a BJA club.   Firstly, it's impossible to get your dan grade in under eighteen months and that is the MINIMUM. It takes most others at least five years, some people I know took thirty years.   Secondly, there's a reason you do tens of thousands of uchikomi and throws on your way to shodan and it's because you need the muscle memory to perform throws or get the 'feel' for standing or ground grappling.   If anyone could watch on the sidelines and then perform it adequately then why would anyone bother with training so hard? No legitimate club would ever give out belts like this because in reality a two month white belt has infinitely more experience.   Not to mention that if you do not earn your shodan competitively then there is a minimum five years in grade at first kyu.  TLDR: your mother's black belt is a joke."
judo,2ycqaj,newhoza,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:25:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, someone is being a bit precious about this. A joke? Not that I have to justify to yourself but this is the same person that was also a competition official for several years and held her level 1 coaching certificate at one stage.   She was far from a casual observer on the sidelines. Whilst I can't accurately recall how long it took her exactly I will when possible get a copy of her licence that will feature dates/details of gradings. She graded through proper contests and not simply over a course of time. (It's entirely possible that I made a mistake and she took over a year.)  My reasoning for the karate - judo statement that you also jumped on was that having learnt one martial art, it would be easier than starting from a total novice.    I know myself from years of breaking down techniques into separate components before drilling the complete technique that my adaptability to Muay Thai a few years ago was much more positive than novices that started at the same time.   It is a far from ludicrous concept that someone already well skilled in one art wouldn't be quicker to grasp another. The willingness to learn and the understanding of their own body mechanics already gives them that advantage.   Anything else you're hung up on that I failed to address?"
judo,2ycqaj,beambeam1,2,Mon Mar 9 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between being actively involved in judo and training than sitting on the sidelines though. Regardless, getting to dan grade whilst barely training is unheard of. If it wasn't then you'd have a load of guys watching YouTube videos then turning up for gradings - it just doesn't happen.   Well the absolute minimum for getting a dan grade is 18 months now in the BJA but the only people I could imagine doing that are wrestlers, BJJ guys or people that train everyday.   We have a lot of ex boxers, military guys who are generally well coordinated that still struggle starting judo from scratch. I'd boxed and done Muay Thai before judo and I can't really say it helped.

I'd boxed and done Muay Thai before judo and I can't really say it helped.   These are generally quite different from judo, but for instance, Shotokan Karate has a few things taken from jiu-jitsu/judo, and also share a lot of ideas about momentum and center of gravity.    Also, a lot of the formal stuff is almost exactly the same, meaning less time has to be spent there too."

It was a more a question on possibility, and the way that the club put me on the back foot straight away - I wondered if it was the norm, or if it was a BJC thing full stop.  One of my boys trains BJA, the other BJA and BJC (at different schools to where I went). We are quite limited in our area but I have been told of one 20 minutes drive away so I am going to probably check that out and see.   Your mum achieving a BB in a year is immense - how is that even possible without any dilution of knowledge and ability?"

It was an easy transition for her and she was quite gutsy when it came to contests!   Your grade matches your skill level and most clubs should be encouraging you adequately. I think, IIRC, you can grade up once every few months so it would be staggered over a period of time.  I have seen some club members of your age go from novice to black inside three years with twice a week class attendance.  Obviously, this would be quicker if you were participating regularly in gradings where you can gather more points towards your next grading.  It must be a BJC thing, I don't know why they would straight out tell you that you won't reach black belt status starting so late (which isn't late at all to me). It makes no sense.  In all honestly, across 20 years of judo all over the UK, I have very very limited experience of BJC events, clubs or players."

Anyways the reason said you would never get a blackbelt is because in Judo I think you have to compete and that's the only way to get it. In Canada if you train without ever competeing you will only ever make Brownbelt but if you fight/win tournaments you can make Black after 40 points. Anyways belts don't mean shit. If you like something train if your goal is a belt then your training for all the wrong reasons lol
judo,2ybzzp,cheejiayuan512,2,Sun Mar 8 12:51:52 2015 UTC,"I often have the same problem, when executing uchi mata with standard lapel/high lapel and sleeve grip. although i always practice with correct tsurikomi i just can't pull it of in randori/shiai. But getting a classical tsurikomi in randori/shiai is (as i see it) almost not possible anyway.  The thing is, to pull it off like in your picture the other parts of the throw have to be correct. Kamigawa's opponent is full onto his hip and an exaggerated bent at the waist combined with the ""lifting elbow"" keeps him there. Ono does this pretty often: http://youtu.be/edNpLKPSWIQ  But your support foot has to be pretty deep to ensure hip contact. At least that's how i explain it to myself. But i'm looking forward to read more advices regarding tsurite for uchi mata in randori/shiai-situations."
judo,2ybzzp,trumfnator,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"Getting the arm pulled back like that is a common error. It's still possible to pull off the throw (as Inoue did in the image you have linked), though it's still something to avoid, not least because you risk damaging your shoulder.  So, how to stop it? Getting into this position is often a symptom of not having enough space to rotate your body during the tsukuri phase of the technique, if you are too close to uke when you start the technique, then when you try to turn in, there is not enough space for body and arm, so the arm gets left behind.   I see from your response above that you favour an over the back grip, if you want to  do your uchimata from here then you are automatically going to be much closer to uke from the off. Are you gripping deep on their back, locking their shoulder into your armpit ""Russian style"" or gripping higher, say around the top of  their shoulder blade and trying to keep your elbow infront of them and pointing to the floor so as to force them into a bent over position? I am going to guess whichever grip you are using you are entering quite deep with your hip, going for the koshi waza, rather than ashi waza variation of the throw. In which case, I'd suggest maybe switching it up, going for the ashi waza version whereby your hip does not go as deep and you are really attacking their near leg.  Hope that helps, if you can provide a bit more detail on how you do the throw, we may be able to help a bit more."

Judo should embrace this time of change not only to attract more students, but to cement itself as one of the pillars of grappling. I agree with you btw."
judo,2y9anm,xin05,22,Sat Mar 7 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't understand the thought process behind distancing judo from mma.   There are multiple thought processes at work here, depending on who you are talking to...   The Gentle Way faction: This type of judoist (or other martial artist) believes so strongly, that their exotic asian martial art is  actually a philosophy of peace and a path to enlightenment, that it borderlines esoteric nonsense. To them judo's most ""violent"" form is a chivalrous, fair and clean sport. In their knowledge and point of view, dangerous techniques do not exist in judo and the absense of such ""cruel and unfair"" methods is all what judo is about. These people don't know anything about the rules of MMA and think there aren't any. The cage, the occasional blood and the trash talk don't help that image (MMA organizations are not innocent in creating that image btw.). Anyway: To this faction MMA represents everything Judo should not be (brutal, rude and flashy). The feudal lords: Powerful or influental functionaries are afraid of competition and want to defend their territory. They hide behind the arguments of the Gentle Way faction and (ab)use good words like ""tradition"", while they kill the traditions of judo whenever it suits their interests. The opportunists: Politicians, especially of the conservative sort, prey upon the fears of people who do not know or understand new things. A politician who positions himself against the ""barbaric display of violence that MMA is"", may attract some voters.   Interestingly, the battles in the early days of judo were more violent than MMA is today.   In his later years Kano invited instructors of other martial arts to the Kodokan and gave them support. He also sent his own students to other teachers, so they could learn new things to improve judo. Digging trenches and building walls to seperate oneself from others never did anything good.  EDIT: Just to avoid misunderstandings: I am not against fairness, respect and safety in training or competition. In fact I consider them essential. And I am sure not only most judoists, but also most mma practitioners would agree with me.  In the founders intention, judo is a martial art (which includes self defense application), means to physical education and a pedagogic system, following the guidelines of maximum efficiency and mutual wellfare. Reducing judo by excluding, neglecting or distorting any of these aspects harms the art. We need the exchange of ideas with outsiders in the strife for maximum efficiency, and we need to welcome those who come from other martial arts to learn judo in the mindset of mutual wellfare."

He travels to learn ground techniques from bjj instructors and teaches them throwing techniques in return. A symbiotic relationship. He's currently looking for a way to reform tachi waza for the use in a bjj context (where people often voluntary go to the ground).

Go with Tom to a Club of the Bundesliga and he should do some randori - inluding all throws with leggrabs (so there is no excuse...) - and then there is ""game over"" for the hachidanfrankhiranomifunekanouchideshi ;-)   Frank tried to systemize the Judo of Hirano and there are some concepts, which they did understand and are useful even now.

To Tokio Hirano: There are some good works in the internet and you know them all. The one on judoinfo.com about changing kuzushi and tsukuri, the other from CK about waves and circles, the videos from the summerschool in Belgium? and the Hirano Kata, which is also very interesting because of the principles shown before the throw and there is one work about his ""hopping entry"" compared to the classic ones. There is also a paper - even a book - announced by Carl de Cree for 2015 and I do hope, that he really write on his book after stoping posting and use a lot of (useless) energy .   To me most important is the flow of Hiranos Judo as an expression of seiryoku zenyo and moving in waves and circles and the understanding of unbalancing an opponent with preparing body moves. Hiranos Judo is round as a ball and not like a square.  I have no chance to copy Hiranos Judo cause I don't have the mobility and I am much to heavy (120kg).

judo,2y5iet,fedornuthugger,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"One thing I realised I was doing wrong in randori was not turning into the throw, I would unconsciously keep my eyes on the opponent or feel like the throw had failed already.  If this is actually you're problem, you need to properly turn as you're throwing, the person will follow if you have them. You should do drills where you move about the mat and then go for a throw for real, take off into, at this stage you're probably just lacking the muscle memory to enter and throw in randori"

judo,2y5iet,caseharts,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"good ashiwaza will setup your seoinage. You need to learn some effective ashiwaza to keep your opponents guessing and setup the openings for your bigger throws. A good feint of O-Ouchi Gari (by bumping your opponents leg that you would normally attack) - will make them take the big step you need to drop seoi right under them. You need to stop thinking in terms of ''i'll execute my throw'' and start thinking about ''how can I use Kazushi, feints and ashiwaza to get my opponent to react in a way to facilitate the setup of my throw. Another tip for seoi is you need pull your opponent's posture down - then when they react by resisting upwards you pull them up and downward again with your drop seoi or non-drop. Bring their posture down-up-down - this can be done with a quick shake down - up then down again. I also can't stress enough the reality that you need to dominate the opponent's sleeve grip (if right on right or left on left) to effectively execute most big throws."
judo,2y5iet,caseharts,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"I've found ippon seoi nage works really well. You've gotta manipulate them into opening their elbow or capitalize well on a mistake, but with good kuzushi, it should serve you well - especially in BJJ where people have a tendency to stiff-arm. Drop seoi nage chains well into kata guruma, which is illegal in IJF judo but fair game in BJJ.  I would definitely invest some practice into uchi mata as well. It takes some effort to perfect, but it works well against people in the defensive wrestling stance.   If you're a guard player, sutemi-waza like tomoe nage could work well for you since the worst-case scenario lands you in guard. Just don't fall into the jiu-jitsu trap of only using sutemi-waza - learn the whole judo!"

judo,2y2nfw,deinonychusturtlepie,2,Fri Mar 6 04:51:20 2015 UTC,"Utsuri Goshi is kind of an odd throw, at least the way it is executed nowadays. Take a look these examples here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBTuQZmaaOc  http://youtu.be/0zOqET8-clY  All those are great throws. But something strikes one as odd: We have to lift/push uke up for a proper Utsuri Goshi, do we? This is quite a feat of strength isn't it? Makes one wonder how this could be the maximum efficient way to throw from here.  Recently, when I visited a very competent 8. dan, who put quite some research into the more old school way of doing judo, he showed me an interesting way to throw uki goshi. Basically I am standing close to the side of uke with his arm around my neck and my arm around his back. Exactly the same starting postion as for Utsuri Goshi as seen in the videos above.  Instead of moving my hips in a complicated way in front of his to enter uki goshi (you probably know that game when both players try to get their hips in front of the other one for a hip technique) you do something different: Push him away from you with your hips to create a gap to enter for uki goshi. While practicing this, he told me, that this is the actual, original Utsuri Goshi. It doesn't require tossing uke up into the air as taught nowadays, but merely pushing him away with the hips so we can enter with them.   I can only speculate that some of the masters in the early days of judo were so strong and quick when doing that, that their opponents feet left the ground already during that push or that it looked as if and the later generations believed that it actually had to be that way.  So, as long as you don't aim to show it that way during an exam (it is unlikely the examiners will accept the old school form), you can try the non-lifting method."

Then they counter ashiwaza:   Okuri ash harai countered with tsubami gaeshi. (I believe the counter; I don't believe the set-up.) Kouchigari (which isn't in nage no kata) countered with hiza guruma. Ouchigari countered with tomoe nage. Sasaetsurikomiashi countered with sumi otoshi.   Finally they counter koshiwaza:   Uchimata countered with tai otoshi/ashi guruma. Hane goshi countered with kari gaeshi. Harai goshi countered with ushiro goshi. Hane goshi countered with utsuri goshi. Uki goshi countered with yoko wakare. Ogoshi countered with ippon seoinage."

Ko Tsuri Goshi looks a lot like O Goshi, whereas O Tsuri Goshi is fairly distinct.  Here's a video of Iliadis going over them, probably explains it a lot better than I can."

I guess it might eventually help to educate the fans though, if winning throws were identified."
judo,2xw02o,death_of_field,5,Wed Mar 4 11:23:58 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I think the MMA audience would not remember the many Japanese terms from one match to another, which is the whole point. He goes a bit overboard with the 10th-planet terms sometimes because that's his thing, to the point where even BJJ guys don't know what he's talking about, but at least ""twister"" is easier for an average American fan to remember than ""uchi-mata"".  One thing he could do (and this might not be popular here) is use wrestling terms, which are familiar to the many Americans who have been around wrestling and are easier for English speakers to remember, like ""double-leg"", ""hip throw"", or ""lateral drop"". Most no-gi takedowns have wrestling equivalents, after all, but there's not necessarily a one-to-one relationship with gi throws."
judo,2xw02o,pryoslice,2,Wed Mar 4 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"I agree about using English terms.  Say the original name as Kano taught it, and then a quick English description (eg. hip throw, foot throw, sacrifice throw etc).  Muay thai techniques are very seldom described (if ever) by their original Thai names, for example.  But then, the Thais aren't too fussed about which language is involved.  Judo has a far stricter tradition when it comes to nomenclature. Judo is taught all over the world using the Japanese names for each throw, the opposite is true for a martial art like muay thai.    I suppose for the average UFC fan or casual fan of MMA, they don't have to learn the Japanese names.  If they were really interested in taking up judo then of course they'd learn the proper names.  But for the average MMA fan, an English description should be acceptable."

judo,2xw02o,Brian175,2,Wed Mar 4 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"One of the best bonuses of using an agreed-upon term, regardless of language of origin, is cross-cultural understanding. You could tell person who speaks no English that your tokui waza is hane goshi, and if they're a well-trained judoka, they'll smile and nod."
judo,2xw02o,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see this argument a lot. I really wonder what the ratio is of beginner's having to learn Japanese terms in their host country versus Judoka traveling abroad and being able to train adequately using an agreed-upon term. Nevermind, you won't understand anything else amongst each other."
judo,2xw02o,Brian175,4,Wed Mar 4 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"In my experience, both as the outsider, and receiving international students, I find it reflects poorly on the sensei if you have students that can't communicate due to lack of terminology knowledge. Ultimately, if learning a couple dozen words helps you do more judo with a larger group of people, I'd say it's worth the extra effort."
judo,2xw02o,silvaphysh13,3,Wed Mar 4 19:56:53 2015 UTC,"I did another Japanese martial art for a while that had the same approach, but, unfortunately, never had a chance to train with people that didn't speak English. However, the experience in Brazilian jiu-jitus suggests that the language barrier presented by training terms is not that big of a deal. Most techniques have been translated to English (with a few exceptions, like ""omoplata""). I've heard a number of accounts of people going to train in Brazil without much language background. Generally, they either figured out what they're supposed to be drilling by watching others or the instructor showed them. After all, the name of the technique is not sufficient for proper training (unless you're just getting reps in, which you could do at home). It's a lot of ""put your foot here, no, more over here, now get a grip here"". That requires a bit more Japanese (or Portuguese) than you would pick up in class."
judo,2xw02o,pryoslice,0,Wed Mar 4 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"That's only because you expect them to know Japanese. Otherwise, you would not care if they knew Japanese terms only that they be able to throw or not throw. My chances of doing Judo outside an English speaking country is pretty slim. So perhaps I'm just being selfish and there are a ton of international students who benefit from it, but somehow I doubt it outweighs the learning curve we are presenting to non-Japanese students."
judo,2xw02o,Brian175,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think learning serveral dozen words in another language is that tall of an order. Firstly, it's reinforced through the actual learning and application of the technique, so it's not as if students are being asked to do soulless, rote memorization. Also, just because you personally don't envision yourself doing any judo internationally doesn't mean that the discipline as a whole doesn't benefit from having common terminology.   I think you might possibly be guilty of exhibiting an English language bias. It's not that steep a learning curve. If one can learn to throw another person using their body in a number of different ways, asking them to learn some new terminology isn't so arduous."
judo,2xw02o,BootsLikeMafia,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:29:39 2015 UTC,"Of course I'm exhibiting an English bias. I speak English. I get it, Judoka are very traditional and learning Japanese has been the tradition since it was envisioned and used to spread Japanese culture. But what I'm saying isn't some one off complaint. It's a very common critique and I'm sure there can be many studies done on learning dissonance when using unfamiliar terms to identify items or techniques. It's not that it's just so arduous. It's just unnecessary.   Wrestling continues to be a big international sport despite the lack of universal terminology. It's just a fact that most people spend their time learning Judo in their home language. We're adding an unnecessary task and learning curve in order to spread Japanese culture, a doctrine started during Japanese imperialism, for very little benefit. I get it, it's always been this way, you don't see it why it should change, it'll always be this way. It doesn't make it the most efficient way of doing things."
judo,2xw02o,Brian175,2,Wed Mar 4 22:48:02 2015 UTC,"Then we'd have to say inner thigh throw not only in english but also French, German, Spanish, Russian,Mongolian and 150 other languages."

judo,2xw02o,judokalinker,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:15:51 2015 UTC,Limited language barrier? It would still be very great. You would just have a universal terminology for techniques you already know while still missing the added details he's putting in there from his home language. You gain nothing over a physical demonstration. Guess what people train BJJ in Brazil all the time without universal terminology. What we do is a physical sport. It can be demonstrated. You guys are really overstating this whole international thing.
judo,2xw02o,Brian175,6,Wed Mar 4 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"Having trained with people who don't speak more english than ""hi,my name is so and so"", and it is easier communicating with words than having to grab an uke and demonstrate what you are talking about. Coming from wrestling, I love how much easier it is to talk about techniques with people in judo. Even within the US, (and within different parts of a state), people have different terminologies for things.   No, it isn't a cornerstone of the art, but I think it is pretty nifty. You don't, and that is fine too."

judo,2xw02o,Brian175,2,Wed Mar 4 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"When I was in France, I was so thankful for the Japanese terms. Having a ""common third language"" in the dojo really is helpful. My French was passable, but to learn judo requires vocabulary you don't really learn in the classroom.  The point of universality is that no matter where you are, you know the name of the term. For example, I don't know what rear-naked choke would be in French. But if I said hadake jime, then my French-speaking partner would know what I meant."

Sasae tsurikomi ashi would be ""derribo levantando y trancando un pie"" or some shit like that.  I like having an universal nomenclature, and Japanese is actually much easier to enunciate than English. Phonetically, English is harder and more ambiguous than Japanese. Boxing and BBJ are two martial arts that use English terms, and most people I meet struggle to pronounce them right. As a consequence, the terms become misspelled, bastardized, and end up losing their meaning and/or falling into disuse."

And yes as crazy as this sounds VERY few throws/takedowns in judo don't exist in wrestling im not going to use the japanese term when Ive used one term most of my life. I wouldn't expect a korean wrestler to say the ENGLISH version of my wrestling moves? Adding those names adds nothing to my game. Acting like it does is naive. It has usefulness if I train in like belarus with some judoka maybe? Not worth it for me. For a white belt you defend the shit out of judo tradition.

My rank doesn't have anything to do with how much I love martial arts as a whole. I've played sports my entire life (which hasn't been that long, early 20s) and have always admired martial arts from afar, when the opportunity opened up I jumped in. I just happened to have an affinity for Judo/grappling. It could've been greco-roman, sambo, or muay thai, etc doesn't matter. I love all the little quirks and differences in the techniques, the rule sets AND the culture. I don't want or need a streamlined version of wrestling, it's all wrestling, but it all comes from different places in the world and I love it and respect it.

I believe there is still a stigma around learning the japanese names because of the karate boom from ""The Karate Kid"". Anytime you mention a japanese martial art all anyone can think of is mr miyagi and daniel-san painting fences. This makes using the names seem somehow ""uncool"".

I figure if she is in the same weight class as her opponent she would probably do pretty well. Naturally i dont even know what her weightclass would be on the male side.
judo,2xv9vg,TheIronMoose,11,Wed Mar 4 07:25:35 2015 UTC,"No. Men are massively stronger than women and can take a huge amount more punishment.  It's why national judo teams tend to train women and adolescent men together, with the main male team separately. There's basically two ways it can go. Rhonda manages to completely out class her opponent, and it looks like her normal matches or it turns into a career ending bloody beat down. It's just not worth it."
judo,2xv9vg,DoorsofPerceptron,0,Wed Mar 4 09:41:00 2015 UTC,"In general yes men are stronger than women, but a woman's pain threshold should be the same or higher than a mans. The strength differential should be able to be trained against though.  I know it would be ugly but I feel like if she was against a male opponent of a similar weight class, and didn't completely outclass her in strength, she would probably do pretty well.   I know she has no incentive to fight against the male side when she can just dominate the female side for a while, it was just a curiosity."
judo,2xv9vg,TheIronMoose,2,Wed Mar 4 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"It's not about pain thresholds. Men aren't tougher because they don't mind being hurt, they are tougher because they have higher bone density, thicker bones, more muscles and stronger tendons than women.  If you compare Olympic lift records, then in roughly the same weight category, men consistently lift 30% more than women, and 75kg women are noticeably weaker than 56kg men.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_records_in_weightlifting"
judo,2xv9vg,DoorsofPerceptron,3,Wed Mar 4 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"On top of that the talent on the men's side is much higher. She wouldn't have the huge skill disparity that she has on the women's side.

Most of them said that they had to put a fair bit of effort in, even fighting a novice, just because of the size difference.  And then the first time you grip up with someone the same size as you and you realize ""My god, they have to put up with this all the time!""."
judo,2xn504,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:17:07 2015 UTC,My tallest and heaviest opponent in shiai was 6 feet 7 inches and 350 lbs ...  Thats very fascinating if you are 260lbs yourself and used to be the heavier one.  .
judo,2xn504,jimplaysdnd,1 point,Mon Mar 2 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"Fought a couple of larger guys, in that mid 300 range. I quite like that to be honest, probably because they feel so slow after spending so much time with lighter fighters; and because much of my own judo is based around ashiwaza or taiotoshi. Make them step, that's the trick with the really big guys. They're used to being static so not only does making them move put them out of their comfort zone, once you can get them to take a step you can roll out the deashiharai / kosoto etc and help them along."
judo,2xn504,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"That's a good gameplan.  I had a different one (or non ...). When he tried a Harai Goshi I blocked and won with Ura Nage. If you are not on roids there is a limit of strenght and the heavier opponent isn't stronger - he is only heavier. As you said, if someone is out of the support of his center of gravity, it doesnt matter how heavy he is, if you can move him. So Ashi Waza is the most elegant way.  Most troubles I have is with opponents which are stocky, 5 feet 8 inches and 100+ ...  Any advice?  ."
judo,2xn504,jimplaysdnd,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:46:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on your own proclivities and tokuiwaza to an extent. Personally I'd go for dominant grip, either neck or down the back, and look for osoto / harai / uchimata / makikomi of some flavour, sasae if you want options for the opposite direction. Have to watch for uranage / sukuinage, so don't stand around with the dominant grip, use it."
judo,2xn504,fleischlaberl,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice!  Maybe I should use my strenght and not try to do ""beautiful judo"", if there is no way to do some. It's also a habit from randori, because there is no Judo if you dominate a (much) lighter pertners with the grip top/down. But in shiai the short and heavy ones are difficult to beat with a classic lapel-sleeve grip, because the COG is so low and they are difficult to move, because they are strong and fast too.   By the way - I like the Judo of Muneta!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU8Rym-OpaI  Horrific ;-)  ."
judo,2xn504,jimplaysdnd,8,Tue Mar 3 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"I want to be brutal here, and say there's so much wrong with this comment.   But firstly, let's separate out some components. Shiai, or even randori for the purposes of shiai, is always going to be driven by the desire to win, and that comes with utilization of all your physical faculties - your judo skill, but also your strength and stamina and everything else. But: the difference between judo at low and top-end levels is how your physical attributes are applied. A good judoka is applying their strength through good judo fundamentals. No amount of brute force is going to matter if you have no kuzushi. But you can recognise 'beautiful judo' even in watching someone like Muneta - his ashiwaza, his seoinage counter, there's a big number of things in that video that are amazing - especially in the light of the fact that the people he's moving are both very big and very strong (and very skilled). And this is from Muneta, of all people, the blobbiest judoka to walk the world. His footwork in particular is just, frankly, amazing.  I should point out that, to me, there is a distinction between 'classical' judo - that exemplified by kata; and competition judo, which as noted above comes from the end product of winning. There's a series of judo books called the Masterclass series, each of which usually concentrates on a single technique. They're an interesting look into how a 'basic' technique is adapted for the purposes of winning - dealing with different bodytypes, handedness, counters etc. Each variant is an answer to a particular problem. Those have evolved purely because of shiai.   So as for training - I don't know if you're beginning judo or a ways through your journey - but based on what you've written I'm going to say this: at this point, forget about your strength. When you do randori you should always have a goal, it shouldn't be just 'mini-shiai', something I think happens at a lot of dojos - it should be done at a variety of intensities. Once the fundamentals are ingrained - you have good uchikomi, you know some throws to either side - most of your randori should be throw for throw, but using movement to set up your throws. You and your partner grip up lightly - at first with 'classical' grips, but developing gripping options over time - and you move with your partner. Not pulling and pushing, but just flowing in movement with them. It's almost like a dance. Now during this dance, first they are going to throw you, and then you are going to throw them, over and over. But here's the thing - this isn't a full bore, teeth gritted throw - it's a throw that has to come from the movement. It needs to become something almost instinctual - I feel my partners bodyweight shift out of line, so I adjust to their position and throw. Kuzushi from movement at this stage. No strength at all.  And here's the thing - even doing this you'll recognise differences in bodytypes. You'll find the movements and throws that develop from fighting a huge monster versus a tiny tiddler are going to be different. It's understanding those fundamental differences that leads to competition judo when you start building strength back in. And once you have some basic feel for these drills, you can play with options (you're going to throw and get thrown anyway, so why not try ideas out). How does it feel going collar / lapel versus person a versus person b? How does a traditional grip feel versus a high lapel grip versus behind the neck, and how does it vary depending on the throw you're using? When I started, because of my height and size I was pushed towards a back-of-neck grip (by coaches who had both coached and competed at very high levels, so they knew what they were talking about). But I found through this kind of experimentation that a lot of my judo worked better with a high lapel grip instead of behind the neck. This is the crucible where you work these things out for yourself.  Once you have a good feel for this, then you start to integrate strength. Not in gripping at the start - you need to learn to integrate strength into the kuzushi and tsukuri (preferably not too much into kake unless you hate your partner). So when the movement dictates you throw, you move into the throw aggressively. At this level uke can start to resist, meaning you have to use your strength as part of the throw. This is not to mean your tachiwaza should become ugly, or that you should try and makikomi every throw - it's to make you become aware of when and where strength needs to be applied. The judo should still be crisp and clean easily recognisable techniques - the strenghth shouldn't bastardize what you intended.   Once you build judo through movement, then you can start playing with full application of strength on fully resisting partners - sometimes using randori-as-shiai, sometimes still doing throw for throw, but with partner doing everything then can to not get thrown.   Randori is collaborative, with you both intending to learn - this is how you do so.  And finally: Heavyweights, more so than any other class, have to rely on strength - sorry, it's just the harsh truth. I'm almost inclined to call it a totally different sport from the other weight classes, just because of the difference in styles that comes with fighting people who are much bigger and stronger - there tends to be less movement, less combinations and more 'decisive' throws - which leads to slightly more defensive judo. But at the higher ends you can't have that without good basic judo skills. It's (usually) not as pretty as lighter weight classes - sorry - but there's a beauty in raw power too."

A lot of times in BJJ, we raise up the elbow during a kimura, and that's when it goes from an elbow lock, to a shoulder lock. Also, with an omopolata, you have to basically get in the final position, and break your opponent down to their stomach (they probably will be anyways) and lean into them to keep their shoulder trapped and on the ground. Then when you move the wrist forward, it will be the exact same kind of pressure as a kimura."

judo,2xllew,Geschichtenerzaehler,0,Mon Mar 2 12:44:15 2015 UTC,"As your interest in Judo is wide, I want to give you a link to another view of Budo. You can look at Judo from a mechanic or physical point but also in a more narrative way with the experience of old masters. Its just a different concept or angle or ""story telling"" ;-) but sometimes also eye and mind opening:  http://www.budopedia.de/wiki/Sabaki  ."
judo,2xllew,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 13:49:57 2015 UTC,"Uhm ... I read a bit into that, until the content began to feel odd, then I scrolled back up and noticed the name of the author: Werner Lind. The name sounded familiar. Then it clicked. He wrote the ""Lexikon der Kampfkünste"". Since I read what he wrote about Sambo in there, I do not trust his research anymore."
judo,2xllew,Geschichtenerzaehler,0,Mon Mar 2 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't hear anything about Lind before reflecting on taisabaki and ma-ai two weeks ago so I can't say anything to  the qualities of the author - and I am too old, looking for a ""budo master"", the best, the genuine, the one and only - so I am not an uchi deshi or a fanboy of Werner (read he died last December ...).  But as you too I am fascinated from the riddle of Judo and it is a complex one for body, mind and character. As Judo is rooted in the past before ""sports"" and ""science"", its interesting, how the ""old masters"" explained their practice and knowlege. They use different concepts/words/definitions and are often speaking in metaphors or stories and I think that in this way listen and learning is  better (a good alternative) as looking to youtube videos and copycat. Its open for thinking and creativity and can be experienced via practice.  ."

With this you could probably just call their office and get a good answer.  But on the Judo side of things: in 10 years I've received 2 concussions, one of them moderately serious. You can play as safe as you want, sometimes you work with someone who has sloppy technique and you get hurt, that's just how it works.   The risk of getting tossed on your dome is high enough that I would consider waiting a couple of years if I were you. You only get one set of eyes, but Judo will be here forever. If you're hell bent on grappling, go do BJJ for a couple of years until your eyes develop. It's way easier on your head, and you'll come into Judo with beastly ground skills. I wish I hadn't waited so long to start training BJJ because they're basically two sides of the same coin."

Ronda is 10 years beyond anyone else in WMMA she may not hit as hard as some or be as fast or have the best strikes but the way she moves against her competition is like watching mens MMA in the early 2000's one guy plays the game and the other guy is a professional at the game.

judo,2xjaw6,shootdrawwrite,19,Sun Mar 1 06:24:01 2015 UTC,"It is not a throw. Ronda hooks her arm around her opponents neck, for something like Koshi Guruma perhaps, but her opponent is already falling face down. It's too late to enter a throw, they are already transitioning into a ground fight. Next part is hard to see, but Ronda immediatly closes her grip around neck and torso of her opponent and ""rolls"" without any delay into a turtle turnover. It is a ground fighting trick without a specific name. The goal is to force the opponent to take a forward roll over their head on their back to make her open for a control position. To do so Ronda ""rolls/cartwheels"" forward by herself and takes her opponent with her. She comes out on top and immediatly goes for side control or kuzure kesa gatame (broken scarf hold), ther opponent turns away though (big mistake), Ronda takes her back and finishes off with Ude-Hishigi-Juji-Gatame. The transitions are incredibly smooth and testament to thousands of hours of intense drilling.  EDIT: It looks like Zingano didn't just fall forward, but tried a throw, using an underhook, but failed. It was enough though to trigger Ronda's cartwheel-turnover reflex... damn... Ronda is good.  EDIT 2: Look at frame 78 of this gif, go a bit back and forth ...   http://gfycat.com/BlondApprehensiveChanticleer#?frameNum=78  What Zingano tries here doesn't look that stupid anymore. Had she turned her hips more to her left, she might have hit an uki goshi... well... not taking into account she tried this on a former olympian athlete... . Against someone else this might actually have gotten her somewhere. I also guess Zingano had way too much momentum to get a proper stance for a throw."
judo,2xjaw6,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Sun Mar 1 08:43:32 2015 UTC,"Here's a different angle.  Looks like she plants her right foot to keep from following Zingano down, then cartwheels off of her shoulder/neck."
judo,2xjaw6,shootdrawwrite,6,Sun Mar 1 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"Looks like Zingano got an underhook in and tried some kind of throw,... that must have triggered Ronda's cartwheel-turnover reflex... olympian judokas are scary..."
judo,2xjaw6,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"Ude-Hishigi-Juji-Gatame   The videos for this look like a typical arm bar, with the aggressor using his hands to secure his opponent's forearm, not how Rhonda trapped the arm under her armpit, or is it a variation on the same technique?"
judo,2xjaw6,shootdrawwrite,4,Sun Mar 1 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"Ude-Hishigi-Juji-Gatame is the typical armbar. The classical situation has the one who executes it - tori- lying in an 90° angle to the one who receives it - uke -. Tori's legs are placed across uke's body, one over the throat, one over the chest or stomach, uke's arm caught between them and stretched across tori's body. Looked on from above their bodies resemble a cross.  Now understand that the key mechanism is what says what technique it is, not the postion or entry used to execute it. The mechanic works just as well with tori and uke face down, or tori lying on his back and uke sitting or standing.  So the key mechanism is somehow catching uke's arm between one's tighs (of which not necessarily both have to cross uke's body) and overextending the elbow joint.  There are endless variants of this technique. Some of these were given a name, but neither are those are official Kodokan names nor are they standardized.  To see the Ude-Hishigi-Juji-Gatame in Rondas' fight here, look at the standard form again, lift both fighters from the ground in your mind, turn them like a pancake and place them back on the ground. Same technique, just executed upside down."
judo,2xjaw6,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:50:58 2015 UTC,"It is the typical armbar. In judo you generally drill at least four variations: Standard: one leg over the head and one foot below the back. Kami: both legs over his chest Yoko: side version on an opponent lying face down. Gyaku: inverted version on an opponent lying face down.   I  believe this one falls under they gyaku juji gatame category, because ronda has both legs under cat, but it's also executed sideways. Maybe gyaku yoko juji gatame?  The armpit thing is a very neat trick, but I don't think it's an essential part of the technique."
judo,2xjaw6,SVPPB,18,Mon Mar 2 09:35:14 2015 UTC,"You drill specific, discrete techniques, to learn the principles that work.  When you're actually going at it, you'll be applying variations on the techniques, since you're never quite in the ""perfect' situation like during practice.  But when you have a grasp of the fundamental principles, you can learn to improvise effectively by jumping into what are essentially variations of drilled techniques.  I say that like i know what i'm speaking about.  Watching Ronda roll, she has a mastery of the principles at a level so far beyond my own it's mind blowing."
judo,2xjaw6,wonko221,5,Sun Mar 1 06:46:07 2015 UTC,I had an argument on twitter with someone (who obviously does not train) about how masterful a judoka Ronda is. She is truly something special & no female mma athlete (with the possible exception of Cyborg is anywhere near her level.
judo,2xjaw6,psychotropy,14,Sun Mar 1 14:14:03 2015 UTC,"She reminds me of an exchange i read about a master violinist who, after a performance, was approached by an audience member.   ""That was beautiful!   I would give my life to be able to play like that.""  ""Thank you,  ma'am.  That is exactly what i have done.""  Ronda appears to eat,  breathe,  and sleep judo, mma, competition,  pushing herself,  and kicking ass.    People complain that it's not fair that there is no one to challenge her....  I imagine that,  as hard as others also may work, there are few in the world that work as hard as Rowdy."

judo,2xjaw6,Trainer_Kevin,10,Sun Mar 1 09:28:07 2015 UTC,"Wait, did you just come into a judo sub and say ""because in Judo you lose a point by being on your back or something""?

judo,2xjaw6,Trainer_Kevin,6,Sun Mar 1 10:20:03 2015 UTC,"She said her judo instincts kicked in, her quick transitions that her mother trained her in since childhood.   In judo you win the match if you land the opponent cleanly square on their back with a throw.   But if you don't get a nearly perfect throw,  you need to be prepared to move directly into grappling.     Which means if you have just been slammed on your back,  you don't have time to shake it off.   You need to start working for advantage right away.   In BJJ you can get points during grappling for making advantageous transitions.   In Judo you do not.   You have added bits to Ronda's comment that she didn't actually say."
judo,2xjaw6,wonko221,4,Sun Mar 1 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"Something also to point out with Ronda's judo vs bjj, or just judo vs bjj in general, is that in judo you transition quickly. As opposed to bjj where players are more accustomed to slower transitions.   I only mention this with Rousey because with a lot of her throws she's transitioning as soon as she hits the mat.   I almost have to believe that she sets up her armbars with throws. I don't know who else does that? She's that good."
judo,2xjaw6,AceDeuceThrice,4,Sun Mar 1 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yes.  (Non-smartass answer: past a certain level, the distinction between those things isn't as strong as you might think. This isn't the kind of thing that's explicitly trained in every judo dojo, but some people do make it something of a specialty, and it is a natural outgrowth of the fine control of your own balance and body positioning that long training in judo develops.)"
judo,2xjaw6,Toptomcat,7,Sun Mar 1 06:29:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty ""standard"" Judo scramble at the upper elite level. Person getting thrown will avoid ippon (match ending throw on the back with considerable force and speed) by spinning out, both players will anticipate the throw being wazari or yuko (not match ending) and move right into newaza (groundwork). Ronda did both.  During the scramble, nothing is really textbook technique. She developed 6th sense for transitioning into groundwork from competing since she was 11.  How many other women in MMA have been training in a combat sport since 11?"
judo,2xjaw6,H2Outbreak,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:29:51 2015 UTC,She just scrambles. Zingano was crazy for wanting to grapple with a Judoka. We are used to these situations and often ends up on top. She finishes it off with a beautiful 'ude-hishigi-waki-gatame' :)

The only difference is the unusual way of holding the wrist with her armpit.  To be a waki gatame, she'd have to be using her armpit as a fulcrum, and that is definitely not what she is doing."
judo,2xjaw6,SVPPB,0,Sun Mar 1 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"What I am sure of is that it is not juji-gatame. The debate, in my opinion, is whether it is hara- or waki-gatame. If she had pushed her belly forward it would become hara-gatame, as the belly would then directly put pressure on the elbow. In this case she is locking the hand in her armpit and leaning backwards with it. But then again I am not an oracle :)"
judo,2xjaw6,Ryvai,2,Sun Mar 1 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"Really?  In hara gatame, you use your belly as a fulcrum because uke's arm is across your body.   Ronda has Zingano's arm between her legs, so he uses her hip as a fulcrum."
judo,2xjaw6,SVPPB,3,Mon Mar 2 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In this case I have to disagree with /u/Ryvai as it is the hips doing the pressure. I've done this variation a number of times (from the top though, not with the opponent facing down) and it is definitely the juji-gatame principle at work."

I think it's more accurate to describe it as IJF/competitive judo evolving into something that's more censored. Not sure how long you've been training, but the ban on leg grabs is something fairly recent, implemented 5 or 6 years ago. Traditional judo had an extensive range of techniques that involve leg attacks like kata guruma, sukuinage, obi-otoshi, etc. But I agree that all the gokyo stuff should still be taught, simply because I don't know what the future holds for these rules, and leaving them out in schools really dilutes the art."

judo,2xdkq7,audentis,2,Fri Feb 27 19:41:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. Holding the leg like he does makes uke fully rotate and not slam his head into the mat. With a belt grip it will be much harder to reliably steer uke.

judo,2xdkq7,fleischlaberl,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:29:12 2015 UTC,Its a Sukui Nage - classification follows principle.
judo,2xdkq7,ReddJudicata,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:23:36 2015 UTC,the kharabelli throw is a hikikomi gaeshi. That is the principle.
judo,2xdkq7,fleischlaberl,1 point,Sat Feb 28 06:08:59 2015 UTC,"Hikikomi gaeshi is a sutemi waza. Do you see any ""sacrifice"" in the ""Khabarelli""? To ""sacrife"" means to ""give away the body"" (捨身技) and I dont see that in this throw of georgian wrestling. ""hiki komi"" means ""pulling down"" and I see a pickup with the hand (like in sukui nage) and the knee in the ""khabarelli"". How can both be the same or even similar?  ."
judo,2xdkq7,ReddJudicata,1 point,Sat Feb 28 11:44:49 2015 UTC,"It means pulling in, actually. The Kodokan classifies it as hikikomi gaeshi.   Suteru means to throw away, by the way."
judo,2xdkq7,fleischlaberl,1 point,Sat Feb 28 14:43:23 2015 UTC,"You are right - I didn't check the Kanji/Hanzi. Its ""pulling in"". Thx!  ""suteru"" means to ""throw away"" like ""discard"" and this leads to ""sutemi"" = ""give away the body"", what you do, when you do a sutemi waza. In a specific way its maybe the best expression of ""Ju Do"" as an Method/Way (do) to be pliant (ju) and yielding (ju) and an expression of ""seiryoku zenyo"", to use a minimum of own energy for a positive outcome.  Why does the Kodokan classify it as hikikomi gashi? I see a different throw - as I explained above. Daigo classifies it as ""some sort of Sukui Nage"" and I also think there is much more lifting action as sacrifiing like in a hikikomi gaeshi. The only part which is the same is ""pulling in"" as tsukuri."
judo,2xdkq7,ReddJudicata,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Because it is.  You pull your opponent in and then pull him over.

judo,2xdkq7,dave_attenburz,0,Sun Mar 1 16:19:09 2015 UTC,There's no way to finish the khabarelli without following your opponent to the ground. What do you think sacrifice throw means?
judo,2xdkq7,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"... without following your opponent to the ground. What do you think sacrifice throw means?   Just entering the discussion for a more general thing to say:  In a sacrifice throw one doesn't follow uke to the ground, one takes him there. Tori sacrifices his own balance and standing position and uses his own dropping mass to take uke to the ground."
judo,2xdkq7,fleischlaberl,0,Sun Mar 1 18:36:56 2015 UTC,"""following your opponent to the ground"" doesn't mean to ""sacrifice"" like in a sutemi waza. You can follow to the ground as a transition from a not perfect completed throw (no ippon) or as a consequence of a throw to complete absolute conroll to the very end of the throw (zanshin) and also in a wrapping motion (like in all makikomi). In all sutemi waza you are ""sacrificing the body"" to your back or to your side and never to the front - like in Khabarelli.    ."

judo,2xdni0,Geschichtenerzaehler,7,Fri Feb 27 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"NEW, ODD & CRAZY THROWS  ""Reverse Seoi Nage""  This modern competition technique comes along in a wide range of variations itself, which makes classifying it rather difficult. Depending on the actual mechanic that makes the technique work, I see Seoi Otoshi, Seoi Nage, Kata Guruma or Sumi Otoshi in it:  (1) Tori drops on one or both knees and pulls uke down over him, either forward or backwards, I'd say it is a Seoi Otoshi.  (2) Tori remains standing, his hips or shoulders work as a fulcrum. I'd say it is a Seoi Nage.  (3) Tori kneels down and wheels uke over the back of his neck. I'd say it is a Kata Guruma.  (4) Tori remains standing but uses no fulcrum but pulls uke down to his back corner. I'd say it's Sumi Otoshi.  Good examples:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmp6uDP02d4 (Compilation)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzxFxQVlQaE  http://youtu.be/LDbmyR5OR_4?t=30s       (0:30-0:36)    I-Zori  I-Zori is actually a Sumo technique:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxsNO77a-oo (I-Zori in Sumo)  http://www.sumoreisen.com/Kimarite/img037.jpg   (Picture)  Overview of Sumo Techniques (German):  http://www.sumoreisen.com/html/kimarite.htm  Toshiro Daigo mentions I-Zori in his annotations to Kata Guruma. It bears similarities to Kata Guruma, but imho also to Ura Nage and perhaps to Idaki Sutemi (Canon of Judo p.206).  Why did I put I-Zori on this list? Watch this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpPDYU2gGAY (Tournament footage)    ""Laats Dive-In""  The Dutch Laats brothers made this technique popular. By many it is considered to be a Kata Guruma variant, but being a Yoko Sutemi Waza, I'd call it an Uki Waza.  http://youtu.be/Ebmp_Xa82ZM?t=36s   (Johan Laats; tournament footage)  Good examples:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu0gU0RHe3c  http://youtu.be/19CCbI4xuuU?t=49s  http://youtu.be/Htm2UDhEC_Y?t=2h50s (2:50:00; Ne Waza!; Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki demonstrates the same technique as a turtle escape)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlQHMFlIs4Q  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPTXkVmldM    ""Khabarelli""  This throw is named after the Russian Georgian Judoka Shota Khabarelli. The IJF classifies it as an Obi Tori Gaeshi (Hikikomi Gaeshi) variant. In Toshiro Daigo's opinion it is a Sukui Nage variant, probably because Uke is grabbed by his leg and picked up. There seem to be versions without picking the leg nowadays (!).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzh9QXtgBcs (Shota Khabarelli; Tournament footage)  Good examples:  http://youtu.be/XCCnChieZTc?t=2m46s (2:46-2:50 and 2:54-2:58)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCRkFTOSx0 (No leg grip; tournament footage)    ""Crazy Judo Throw""  Before I write more about this, watch with your own eyes:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZGTAVATPoI  The kake is executed with the hips. Uke was pulled onto the hips by the belt. Imho it is a Tsuri Goshi variant.    Unknown counter to Uchi Mata  Take a look:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzargRLqz4   This is labeled as Uchi Mata Gaeshi, but is it? The throw looks a bit like Uchi mata Sukashi, but tori uses his foot to pull uke's foot up. I wonder if this is a Ko Soto Gake variant...    Double-Knee-Jump-Roll  A beautiful throw:  http://youtu.be/UN-T47_ffvQ?t=44s   (0:44 - 0:50)  I'd call it a (Yoko) Tomoe Nage.  Here's another version of it:  http://youtu.be/kLDf4Ty12yE?t=16s   (0:16 - 0:22)    Hikikomi Waza  This is not a single technique, but an entire group of techniques. Hikikomi (or Hikkomi) Waza are techniques used to pull uke into Ne Waza. Many of them are variants of Hikikomi Gaeshi, Sumi Gaeshi, Uki Waza, Kibisu Gaeshi, Yoko Wakare, Kuchiki Taoshi, Kata Guruma,  Seoi Otoshi, Kansetsu Waza or Shime Waza with entries from a standing position. There are so many of these takedowns, that I'll just stop here and give you some videos to get an impression. You'll probably recognize some of  the clips/techniques listed above or in the other lists...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN-T47_ffvQ  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDf4Ty12yE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjpeDX94uEs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I0hsxyaf5M    Ko Uchi Maki Komi meets Tai Otoshi ?  There has been some discussion below about this:  http://youtu.be/3WHWJ8bJ9fk?t=1m33s  Don't ask me what it is. We couldn't agree on something. Sumi Otoshi, Tai Otoshi, ""Ko Uchi Gake"" and Kushiki Taoshi (using the leg instead of the hand) have been suggested.

judo,2xdni0,fleischlaberl,2,Sat Feb 28 08:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking ko uchi gake as he is using his foot as a hook/block and driving uke over it. It would probably come under ko uchi makikomi by most people's usage but to me it doesn't have the ""wrap around"" of a makikomi (which doesn't stop the term being used for any throw where tori falls for some reason).  Amazing turning action though."
judo,2xdni0,fleischlaberl,1 point,Sat Feb 28 08:53:03 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... I noticed though, that the tori doesn't use his leg to ""gake"", meaning he doesn't ""rip out the roots"" (pulling ukes' foot off the ground). This video illustrates what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAXkIQpyJQk  Uke's foot is merely blocked instead, not swept, reaped or pulled up... thinking about this places the technique in the Kuchiki Taoshi realm (with tori using his leg instead of his hand to block uke's leg). I remember CK making a similar call for a somewhat similar technique.  The Hand action, the way uke is pushed over to the side reminds me of Tai Otoshi instead...   Again I am not sure.  Thank you for your input!"

judo,2xdni0,Hippocampus88,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:08:08 2015 UTC,"... it can give interesting insight into what is happening.   Yes. Having names to associate with mechanisms is actually helpful. It helps understanding techniques. We just have to be careful not to be railroaded into rigid thinking.  Some of the ""veterans"" of the German judo forum don't bother much about the differences between techniques anymore. Insisting on differences has led to some very bad developments in German judo in the past. By over-emphasing the differences between techniques the applicability became secondary in some clubs.  Any seperation of techniques is artificial, while in reality the lines are completely blurred. I think the diversity of ways to execute ""Reverse Seoi Nage"" illustrates this well. Or just look how similar some instances of Hane Goshi and Koshi Uchi Mata are..."

I am guilty of this. :)  But to my, or our defense, having names and terminology supports not only communicating, but also thinking about a matter. Sometimes you must name an idea or concept before you can properly process it. I am fully aware though, that rigid categorization can become an obstacle in the very same process.  In the case of Hirano's judo insufficient understanding is a big problem. His Judo is unique and complex. I haven't seen much of it though, mostly what has been posted on the internet and a tiny glimpse I learned from a Judo teacher I know.  Hirano totally breaks out of some common concepts or had a deeper understanding of how throws are supposed to work than most people alive now."

judo,2xdni0,dave_attenburz,1 point,Mon Mar 2 08:56:46 2015 UTC,I see it as a sumi-otoshi variant. It's pretty clear that it is te-waza. The leg hook seems to be needed so that uke cannot take an evasive step (similar to o-soto-otoshi). So maybe it could be labelled as 'Ko-soto-otoshi'.
judo,2xdni0,dave_attenburz,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:41:25 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear that it is te-waza.   I agree. The emphasis on the use of hands places this more deeply in the Te Waza realm than in the Ashi Waza realm, since, other than blocking, tori's leg remains passive.   I see it as a sumi-otoshi variant.   The direction speaks for it, yet the leg block says either Tai Otoshi or even Kuchiki Taoshi (except using the leg instead of the hand to block uke's leg). Tori's leg in O Soto Otoshi is not passive (or at least shouldn't be).   So maybe it could be labelled as 'Ko-soto-otoshi'.   I'd be careful about arranging Japanese words in a new way... ;)  Anyway shouldn't it be ""Ko Uchi Otoshi""?"

Is Khabarelli just a beast or what am I missing?  edit: I know that Khabarelli was famously a monster but even monsters have to follow the biomechanics of the human body.
judo,2xch8k,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Fri Feb 27 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"I think what's going on is Khaberelli goes round and then in. The arm is only strong initially as a direct block, once you start moving at an angle towards the other side of the body it's extremely ineffective.  So, he steps out with his left leg, and then draws his right hip off to the side before stepping directly in, but by this point he's moving diagonally across the arm, and towards Uki's far hip rather than straight down the arm towards the shoulder joint.  It's clearer in the slow motion repeat."
judo,2xch8k,GothSnoopy,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"Good observation, the arm is pretty useless at stopping him given the rest of the context."
judo,2xch8k,jujiroll,2,Fri Feb 27 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"He came in with his hips at an angle, like previously stated the arm is only strong as a straight on block, so when he threw his hips in for the throw moving essentially away from the block he broke the barrier in the process. Brilliant really. On top of all that he took a really deep step and FULLY committed so there wasn't a chance for anything to go wrong."
judo,2xbt6v,ckristiantyler,6,Fri Feb 27 06:33:45 2015 UTC,"You really need to work on your grip fighting, you were letting the first guy get whatever grip he wanted without either breaking them or getting one of your own to counter his, if that had been a judo match you would have gone flying.  Also you need to be more active at maintaining your base when you're in someone's guard, you let yourself get swept twice by just sitting there while both guys sat up and quite obviously were gearing up to sweep you"
judo,2xbt6v,OceanRacoon,2,Fri Feb 27 08:23:02 2015 UTC,"What threw me for a loop was the left vs left stance, this was the first time I'd fought lefty as a lefty.

judo,2xbt6v,shatinahat,1 point,Fri Feb 27 09:03:53 2015 UTC,Posting can leave you open to getting caught with a kimura. First line of defense should be getting your hips higher than their's. Prevention would be stiff arming to keep their back on the mat in the first place.

judo,2xbt6v,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Mon Mar 2 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"First fight:   Your posture didn't look well when he had you in his guard.   Why didn't you at least attempt a hip escape (shrimp out) when you had you in side control. Make him work for that position.  Second fight:  You had him in side control, but he quickly escaped with a ... uhm.. weird move. Work on your sidecontrol, learn how to shift your mass to keep him from escaping. Sidenote: That's what the Katame no Kata is actually for.  Nice armbar attempt. Practice more ""openers"" to get his arm. There are many, many tricks for that. You had it long enough to try all of them. ;)  When switching between your pins, you basically let go of your opponent for a moment. Big no. Always secure him in some way while you move into a new position.  Your Kesa Gatame needs work, too. Keep your head down. In a submission only match, you can switch into ""Makura Kesa Gatame"" (not an official Kodokan technique name) an hook the hand that holds your opponents head in your own knee (makes his head rest on your arm and tigh like a pillow; Makura = pillow). This means you no longer have to pull with your other arm to keep him secure. You can attempt a lock on the arm you hold now.  Then he mounted you and had like no idea what to... neither did you. Go for an Upah! When he planted his hands be basically invited you to catch one and bridge him over... or just shrimp out of there. He wasn't really good at securing you either."
judo,2xbt6v,fedornuthugger,2,Fri Feb 27 10:42:35 2015 UTC,"In match #1 I really should have turned back into him, which I only realized near the end.  Second match, the dude was hella flexible! In the moment I really didnt feel like I could break that grip, and was hoping that he would make a mistake. I felt like the guy was so slippery I shouldn't go for those arm locks as it would give up my position. When he mounted me, I wanted him to stick a hand in my collar so i could grab and roll. He didn't so I should have tried something else Thanks for the reply! Really appreciate it!"

judo,2x93e5,LegiticusMaximus,9,Thu Feb 26 17:33:17 2015 UTC,"It's normal to prefer certain throws - so normal, in fact, that there's even a Japanese term for it (tokui waza). Many of the greatest judoka of all time rocketed to glory on the perfection of one or two techniques (Inoue's uchimata and Koga's seoinage come to mind).  However, the continual use of sacrifice throws can be a crutch for us jiujiteiros. We tend to be comfortable on our backs, so sutemi waza are low risk. But to improve your overall grappling, you need to create an arsenal that can threaten the opponent in any direction and from any position. Sutemi waza throws are mainly forward-facing throws, so if that's all you've got, it's just a matter of positioning your plane such that you're difficult to throw in that direction. You need attacks to flush your opponent out. Rear throws like ouchigari and osotogari are probably a good start."
judo,2x93e5,bear-knuckle,3,Thu Feb 26 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"Just for clarification, o uchi and o soto are rear throws.  Seoi nage and tai otoshi are considered forward throws.  Most use directions like ""forward"" and ""rear"" in the context of which direction uke is headed."

There's nothing wrong with doing sacrifice-throws as your favorite-techniques. You can alter them for the offence as well as counter techniques and into almost any direction, not just behind the back of uke.   It shouldn't be the only techniques he does, but if they work there's no need to stop using them."
judo,2x93e5,SendoTarget,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"No, he really should stop doing them for a while.   And I say this as someone with tomoe nage as tokui waza.   It's very common for BJJers new to Judo to like sacrifice throws (and, especially, sacrifice throws as counters).  It's easy to understand why: they're pretty easy if your opponent isn't very good and they're doubly good if you're good on the ground.  Unskilled players present many easy counter opportunities. You can wreck the white belt division with a good sumi gaeshi and tani otoshi.    But when they start playing better people they discover that those easy counters are not there and their opponents don't bend over for sumi gaeshi.    Sacrifice throws are terminal throws.  There's no where to go from there.  They end combinations.   If you focus on them too much, too early you don't develop the gripping, moving and combination attacks you need."
judo,2x93e5,ReddJudicata,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:02:10 2015 UTC,"I guess I see it differently since I use sacrifice throws as attacks quite often. They're the end-goal in a lot of my combinations. I'm relatively small by stature (170cm) and getting closer and closer by different tactics is my go-to move. Uranage and sutemiwaza in general are my forte alongside seoinage-techniques. There's a lot of gripplay to use before you can get into a good uranage-position. I think they encourage good positioning and better grip-play because if you half-ass them you're in trouble.  Definitely the emphasis for a beginner should not be on sacrifice-throws though. They should know them, but they should learn a multitude of technics and what is possible for them to develop their own style."
judo,2x93e5,SendoTarget,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"Uchi mata, O soto, and seoi nage are good, basic throws that give you options moving forward or when your opponent is moving forward.

One thing on judo especially only going once a week is be prepared for a steep learning curve for throws.

Though being used as a floor mop sucks, it does give you a good benchmark to study for progressing your technique. I would say keep plugging away at your regular training, with a focus on randori, and the next time you're in a shiai situation, your should not necessarily think about winning, but rather focus on not making the same mistakes twice. My sensei, after every single shiai, asks me ""What did you learn about your judo?"""

Randori is a whole another story though. From what my teacher says, I don't commit to a throw completely I just feel out if the throw is there and then I pull back too quickly. I guess it comes from a fear of being stuck in a bad position. But is there any way to know when to throw and how to fully commit to the technique?  Obscure question I know,"
judo,2x32x1,hb187,4,Wed Feb 25 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"Aside from what /u/hb187 wrote (do more randori!), I gotta ask: How good are your ukemi? Do you feel safe when you are thrown? Are you afraid of it? If so, my advise would be to practice breakfalls more. This will lessen your fear of being countered in randori.  Another thing is letting go of your ego in randori. There are no winners or losers there. Thus you have nothing to lose if you try a throw.  Yet another problem may be that you just feel that something is off when you attempt a throw in randori. Maybe you wasted your energy during the entry? Maybe you feel how uke blocks you? Maybe you have problems maintaining your balance? Once you identified the reason, you can actively look for a solution."

I don't think there is a way to truly know when to throw you just have to feel it by learning through practice some of my best throws have caught me by surprise as well haha especially ashi-waza. I believe that while training you should be striving for beautiful judo but this can be a hindrance for completing the throw so you have to understand that it's ok to throw for a yuko. In competition a messy throw that scores is better than a beautiful one that doesn't. There is a balance to be found though because beginners can find early success in messy judo but it doesn't carry on if you aren't trying to perfect the technique. Once your mind is ready to commit then all you have to do is keep your grips, keep pulling or pushing, keep turning and keep driving with the legs. Also if they manage to create space change technique and keep going till they're on the mat. Score or no score. I learnt to commit to ashi-waza while training for a little while after training for a week I had big bruises on my shins because when they attacked they did it for real whether or not they got the timing right.

In randori I can play by whatever rules I agree with my partner on. My current sensei let's us train as we like: With or without leg grabbing, with or without IJF grip fight rules. So if I felt like it, I'd still use all those techniques.  More generally spoken: It's up to us how we train judo. Judo should be free as art. That's what Kano wanted.   You don't still teach it do you?   I rarely teach judo. If I did it oftener, I'd even include atemi waza (strikes and kicks) and leg locks in my curriculum, at least as far as I am able to teach them.  What I don't get, is how someone can believe that IJF judo is all there is or should be. Judo has the potential to be a lot more than that and we are free to explore this potential to our liking."

judo,2x32x1,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"So I've decided to start practicing a sode tsurkomi goshi with a left collar grip and a right sleeve grip, any pointers for retaining control? I practiced it last class and it felt off compared to both sleeve sode. Also I do mine not like a morote gari but stick arm out to the side and dropping my hips in front."
judo,2x32x1,judokalinker,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"Well, technically I believe that's now just a regular tsurikomi goshi, ala the nage-no-kata version. A couple points on this throw that I find help me out: take a higher collar grip, and think ""knuckles forward"". That will help keep your arm from getting pulled backwards as the throw starts. Second, this is a LOW throw, I usually think butt to knees. Lastly, this is a very tsurite-focused throw. You must pull continuously with your right hand to achieve smooth kake. Hopefully these make sense!"

judo,2x32x1,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling I already know the answer (do more randori!) but here goes anyway...  Randori kicks off and I'm immediately fighting for my life. If we're standing up, I'll usually manage to get grip but that's about it. if we're on the ground, I get pinned quickly and spend my time trying to get out of it. I never seem to get to the offensive part.  I'm fairly new (got my yellow belt last night), so I'm wondering if this is the natural process? Should I be focusing on certain things (ie. trying to get more offensive)?"
judo,2x32x1,academicninja,2,Wed Feb 25 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"Everyone struggles at the beginning. Eventually you will see openings for things that you never noticed before.  Having said that, when I was coming up as a new whitebelt, our randori was structured for the newbies. The first round the upper belts could only defend, then they could only do foot sweeps, then it went live. My upper belts also took the time to give me pointers and correct the mistakes I was making after they threw me or pinned me.  Ask your upper belts to give you some pointers during live randori. Most of all, don't give up. When you get to competition, you'll have already had your butt kicked in every way imaginable in the dojo, so you won't give up easy to a stranger!"

The text really evolved as the video was produced, and creating/redoing audio for it would have been too much. I wanted to create a straight forward, detailed, well-diagrammed learning tool, and felt text was better suited for that.   Throws are so often a blur of actions, so I wanted to present them as a series of moments/stages that illustrate the technique within."

It feels like a long (wrong) way to turn in at first but once you are under you are locked and loaded. In most of the examples shown, they secure both arms to their bodies and launch themselves. I teach beginners to this throw to make your upper hand (lapel) like superman as you turn and slide under and tuck the lower hand around your waist to get the rotation. Remember to bend your knees and keep those hips rotating forward, almost in a corkscrew. Make sure you use a crash-mat because with both sleeves tied up you don't have anything to break-fall with so it can be a bit heavy on your partners. Go Judo Mat Lab."

judo,2wu2d0,vipchicken,3,Mon Feb 23 03:50:29 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: The below method is not pleasant and not particularly good for you and if you fuck it up or have any underlying health issues, you can do serious damage to your kidneys or other organs. So unless this is a Regional Title, National Title or ranked tournament, I wouldn't bother cutting. Just play with the big boys.  You can drop that weight relatively easily in the timeframe specified, but unfortunately it will definitely make a difference to your strength and stamina.  If weigh-in is the night before, you're golden and the post-cut meal will return 95% of your strength. If it's the morning of the competition, be prepared to suffer a moderate to large loss of strength and stamina, depending on how long between weigh in and competition.  To drop 3.4kg you'd be wanting to start drinking a lot of water right now. And by a lot, I mean 2 gallons (about 8 litres) in the next 24 hours.  In the 24 hour period following that, 4 litres.  The day after that, 2 litres.  The day after that, 1 litre.  The day after that, 1/2 of a litre.  The day after that, 1/4 of a litre.  As soon as you hit target weight, keep that level of water intake until weigh-in. If you're one of the lucky ones that gets to drink 1 litre of water the day before competition and still weigh below the threshold, you'll retain 90% of your strength and stamina.  Your diet during this time should be carb free except for what few carbs you get from leafy green vegetables. When I say carb free I mean no bread, rice, pasta or potatoes... these make you retain water. Your meals will look like this, twice a day for six days in a row:   1 x serving of meat (not cured meats - they have too much salt) 1 x serving of vegetables (but not starchy ones) One cup of strong coffee with no sugar and limited milk   Also no added salt to anything. Be prepared for your food to taste like cardboard. Also from about day 3 onwards your mood is going to be awful. You'll be depressed and lethargic. Be prepared for your significant other or housemates to hate you. You'll be a miserable shit.  During the cut, supplement your diet with multivitamins to make up for the stuff you might not otherwise get.  As soon as you step off the scales, drink two litres of water with hydrolite or similar mixed in, then chow down on rice and chicken, salted cashews, chocolate and bananas. Not to the point where your stomach hurts, but where you feel satisfied.  Dry to digest as much as possible before you step onto the mat. Good luck!"
judo,2wu2d0,MrStretchnuts,2,Mon Feb 23 07:29:27 2015 UTC,Also if you haven't cut before be aware that it can mess up your body and you might gas out - my friend couldn't open and close his hand and his calf seized up from a bad cut (he was fine in a couple of hours but obviously he lost the second match).
judo,2wu2d0,geocattes,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:58:25 2015 UTC,That's a bloody good answer. You've given me plenty to think about. Thanks heaps for such an informative response!
judo,2wu2d0,dave_attenburz,3,Mon Feb 23 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"the most useful part of MrStretchnuts' answer for you is the disclaimer.  all other things being equal, the difference between an elite athlete appearing on the podium or losing in the first round may be the weight category they entered in.   for a novice entering their first competition there is no point cutting weight. fair enough if you weigh in at 100.2kg go to the toilet and weigh in again but apart from that your time is better spent practicing judo than worrying what the scales say."
judo,2wu2d0,kg2bee,2,Tue Feb 24 13:04:15 2015 UTC,100.20 kg?! That's 400800.00 bees
judo,2wu2d0,dave_attenburz,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:04:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think the disclaimer has really emphasised the seriousness of this method (and you taking the time to point it out!).  At the time of writing I was 93.4kg, but I usually hang around the 92.x - 93.x mark. The next day (without cutting) I was 92.5kg. I am not quite as close to the limit as your 100.2kg (200 grams over) example, but, I'm still pretty close (or it feels that way, at least).  I am tempted to try to sweat it out because it feels like my goal is actually really close. 2.5kg is a good sweat and poo away, right? :P"
judo,2wt0fg,vioan,2,Sun Feb 22 22:30:18 2015 UTC,Adidas Gi's are generally your best bet. They're light and comfortable and the skirt isnt too long. adidas Judo 500 very cheap
judo,2wt0fg,econtbh,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:13:35 2015 UTC,do you know if is a big difference between J500 and J650? on this web site http://www.ippon-shop.com/en/sports/judo/uniforms/adidas-j500-training-gi.html they mention that J500 is suitable for kids and I am worried about the quality. Adidas is an option because I can order them here in Germany.
judo,2wt0fg,econtbh,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:15:12 2015 UTC,J650's are more suitable.
judo,2wt0fg,zaccbruce,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right. I ordered both of them and after seeing them I decided to go with J650."
judo,2wt0fg,Hippocampus88,2,Tue Mar 17 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"Mizuno keiko is a so-called 1.5 weave, a fair bit lighter than a double. The guys that wear them at my club have been pretty happy- but mind you they haven't yet worn them for a period of years. So who knows how they last compared to a double weave, if that is a concern for you."
judo,2wt0fg,Hippocampus88,1 point,Mon Feb 23 10:00:33 2015 UTC,"I was looking to that one, as well. So, right now the list is: Adidas J500 and J650, Mizuno Keiko and Hayato. Fuji single weave will be an option as well, but I can not find it here in Germany, so will be difficult with returning if the ordered size will not be right. They are not too expensive, so, if they will last 2-3 years should be ok, I guess :)"
judo,2wt0fg,Hippocampus88,2,Mon Feb 23 10:09:27 2015 UTC,"Why not get another Sensei? I own the same Gi (size 170S) and I really like it for training (though my pants are a bit too long). With the 2015 IJF regulations, the skirt needs to be longer (and the fabric is limited to 750g/cm²); so you shouldn't look into the new models even though they are light enough. With Adidas, you should try it before you buy one. As a fairly slim person those were WAY to baggy for me. I now settled with a Green Hill suit, those are very tight, but might be too heavy for you with 950g."
judo,2wt0fg,TheSubGenius,1 point,Tue Feb 24 09:11:02 2015 UTC,"I really like the Sensei, 170 regular is perfect for me,  but I have the feeling that will be a bit too hot to train with it during the summer. That's the only reason why I am looking for one a bit more lightweight. Yes, I will order them, try each and the one who is not suitable I will send it back, that's why I prefer to buy it from Germany, because they agree to send them back if is not suitable, because you ordered them online."
judo,2wt0fg,porl,1 point,Tue Feb 24 09:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'm german too, you should've come to the grand prix last weekend. all the big manufacturers had a stand there, that's where I bought the green hill.  If the 170 (without S) fits you, you might wanna try the 165 J650 Adidas suit. It has a high polyester content, so it feels even lighter. Can't say much about the skirt, as a didn't try on that model."
judo,2wt0fg,porl,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, DanRho Sensei 170 (without S) fits me perfectly even after first 30 degree wash. I have just discussed by phone with a lady from ippon-shop.com and she told me that (for J650) size 175 would be perfect for me (178 cm, 82 kg). I am thinking to order 170 and 175 and send one back after I will try them to see how they fit me. I guess 165 will be  to short for me, especially after washing (30 degrees) it 2-3 times. I was also told that J500 is really mostly for kids (even if they have 180 size) and perhaps I will not be happy with it :)"

It won't do you any good. But you know that.  Would you mind elaborating on your technical findings? I'd really like to read an in depth, step by step description of your approaches. Writing it down may also help yourself to gain a deeper understanding of it. Once you got that, you can start drilling it and you'll surely be able to use it without drinking after a while."
judo,2wr5xc,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sun Feb 22 12:32:55 2015 UTC,the best i can offer you right now is some notes that i took down while training.

judo,2wr5xc,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sun Feb 22 13:05:06 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. I quickly glanced over it. The technical descriptions seem kind of difficult to follow ... gotta look more closely at it.  Would be really great if you created some videos.
judo,2wr5xc,bizquisite,2,Sun Feb 22 13:42:40 2015 UTC,"Nice post. The effects of alcoholic intoxication that immediately jump out to me as being possibly beneficial to judo training, and which I noticed evidence of in your descriptions, are a relaxed physical state and lowered inhibitions."
judo,2wr6mx,nearlydammit,19,Sun Feb 22 12:21:55 2015 UTC,"Don't ban it. Banning techniques should always be a last resort.   Instead, just incentivise people to rely on it less. Allow some form of pinning against an opponent who is on their front, for example, or only call matte when the turtler manages to regain some kind of guard.  Or even give shido for it. I don't know how they can justify giving so many shidos for lack of aggression and banning certain grips because they promote stalling, while not penalising a position that is literally all about stalling."
judo,2wr6mx,Gluckmann,9,Sun Feb 22 14:06:12 2015 UTC,"Or even give shido for it. I don't know how they can justify giving so many shidos for lack of aggression and banning certain grips because they promote stalling, while not penalising a position that is literally all about stalling.   You got a good point here."
judo,2wr6mx,Geschichtenerzaehler,5,Sun Feb 22 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"Actually yes, I would be all for such a rule."
judo,2wr6mx,Geschichtenerzaehler,8,Sun Feb 22 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Ban turtling, make newaza more fun and more real   I agree with you. ""Long term"" turtling should be banned or at least give the opponent some points.  By long term I mean staying in that position for defensive reasons. I am okay with it if it is only used as a short timed transitional position.  Unfortunately the decisions of the IJF don't aim at making Judo a better martial art. Their decisions are driven by selfish motives."
judo,2wr6mx,NittanyOrange,4,Sun Feb 22 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, sure. Transitioning through it would not be so bad. Maybe penalize people for staying in it like /u/Gluckmann said."
judo,2wr6mx,H2Outbreak,5,Sun Feb 22 14:25:35 2015 UTC,"The IJF has a very... interesting view of Judo, and clearly isn't shy on imposing that view.  Unfortunately, that view doesn't include significant newaza, and so they're OK with keeping newaza to a minimum. Turtling is basically saying, 'I don't want to do newaza with you' and since the IJF is OK with that, we won't see it penalized any time soon."
judo,2wr6mx,daveliepmann,4,Sun Feb 22 13:30:06 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted about it, but I haven't developed a strong opinion one way or the other.   I've turtled during newaza usually when I find my self in a disadvantageous position... after escaping a pin but still with my opponent on top of me.  I've also turtled during scrambles when I lose balance, and I'm completely gassed. When my partner tries with all his might to turn me over then quits out of sheer exhaustion, I do feel like douchebag for turtling.   HOWEVER, when my partners turtle, I see it as a fun opportunity to work on turnovers. Depending on the skill of my partners, sometimes I can roll them into a choke or triangle or into a pin. It's a fun part of the ""game"" that we play."
judo,2wr6mx,DoorsofPerceptron,4,Sun Feb 22 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with Gluckman. Apply the rules for stalling on the feet to stalling on the ground: if it's clear that a player is playing completely defensively or stalling for a stand-up, hit them with a shido. Immediately turtling will become much less appealing and newaza will become much more dynamic."
judo,2wr6mx,hb187,5,Sun Feb 22 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"If you banned turtling  you are taking away my last remaining chance to double leg.  My favorite turtle defense, is you drop to turtle, they kneel on one leg/ both legs in front of you, probably looking for sankaku jime, and you just smash them off the mat with a giant moroto gari and into yoko shiho gatame.  The most difficult bit is not giggling like a school girl as you do it."
judo,2wr6mx,daveliepmann,3,Sun Feb 22 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"I watched an MMA bout last night where a guy wound up turtled, protected himself from punches for a good minute, escaped turtle, and went on to win the fight. I really can't agree that it's suicide."
judo,2wr6mx,NDNguitarguy,8,Sun Feb 22 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"Modern MMA has banned knees and kicks to the head of a downed opponent, making turtle a lot more safe to hang out in. It's still not a great position. People escape from being tate-shiho-gatame'd and go on to win the fight—that doesn't mean being pinned in tate-shiho-gatame is a tactic we should encourage."
judo,2wr6mx,hb187,2,Sun Feb 22 16:18:36 2015 UTC,Forgot elbows to the back of the head. Back in the Vale Tudo days those would be huge fight finishers.
judo,2wr6mx,hb187,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:48:26 2015 UTC,"Because there were obviously rules in place preventing his opponent from stomping on his head, spine or football-kicking him in the ribs. Also I could bet that it was not this pose that made him win the fight :)"
judo,2wr6mx,OutOfThBottomlessPit,1 point,Sun Feb 22 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you (or you, davelipmann). The OP said suicide in a martial art, not suicide in a street fight. I turtle in BJJ when appropriate, and turtling also has it's place in MMA.   I do think that turtling is overdone in judo, and going to turtle is a bad habit I have in BJJ from doing it in judo. That being said, it has its uses in other martial arts and even in a street fight. If someone is on top of you and behind you, you're better off in a tight turtle than in any other position (although, of course, you never want the other guy both on top and behind you). Also, when you think about someone who has no martial arts training, they won't hit nearly as hard and wont have the stamina to keep it up. If you somehow find yourself in the position (which is of course bad, I'll repeat), you may just survive or win even without MMA rules to protect you."
judo,2wr6mx,MrStretchnuts,2,Sun Feb 22 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Also, turtle has a few offensive options. If someone is in front of me with their arm in the right place, I can sit out and take the back or wake gatame. If someone puts their leg in front of me from turtle, I can ankle pick and take top position. If someone reaches over me from the side I can hook and roll."
judo,2wr6mx,MrStretchnuts,2,Sun Feb 22 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"There's some pretty effective techniques to attack turtle. Sankaku-jime, koshi-jime, and ushiro ryote-jime are some good ones off the top of my head."
judo,2wr6mx,yknik,5,Sun Feb 22 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion incoming  I agree that turtling can be pretty piss-poor sportsmanship and would get someone murdered in a real fight. Now here's my unpopular opinion:  Regardless of its roots in Jiu Jitsu and by extension, the battlefields of Feudal Japan, a Judo match is not a real fight. It's a sport, with rules and politics and differing schools of thought on what's ""right"" and ""wrong"" and ""sportsmanlike"".  IJF Judo is so far removed from the true martial arts that we are now going as far as taking hosting rights away from countries where there is even a hint of partnership with another combat sport. We even banned top-ranking players from competing in BJJ tournaments for fear of corrupting the ""spirit"" of the sport. I'd go so far as to say that Judo as I play it is now closer to soccer than a real fight.  As a Judoka who dislikes newaza (I'm not terrible at it. I just find it boring compared to tachiwaza.), I consider turtling under the current ruleset to be a legitimate (and yes, I admit it, a monumentally aggravating) technique. There is a subtle art to preventing the dominant player from turning you over or submitting you from what should be the world's most submissive position.  As the last defence of the practise of turtling, I would point out that in Shiai if you end up being thrown and twist out of it but land in the disadvantaged position, sometimes turtling will be your only option to prevent a quickfire hold down or submission from your opponent. In that case, it becomes necessary to be able to turtle effectively, ride out the turnover and submission attempts and wait for the ref to call Matte.  Just a little hint to appeal to the sadistic streak in every Judoka: if your opponent turtling is really getting to you and you want to punish them or make them reconsider being so passive, take the back, make your index and middle fingers of both hands into a point (i.e. bent at the second knuckle) with your ring and pinkie fingers bent at the base knuckle, and drive that point down at the earlobe along the jawline. Feel free to be as rough as you want; after all your opponent gifted you with this opportunity. Your opponent with twitch and squirm and try to grab your hands, just keep driving the knuckles down. Once you reach roughly where the carotid artery is, simply squeeze directly in to either cut off the blood supply or crush the trachea.  Not pretty, semi-effective, always painful. Whether your opponent taps or is stubborn enough to ride it out, once you do that twice in a row they will almost invariably not turtle again.  tl;dr: turtling ain't that bad and sometimes it's necessary. But if you don't like it, there are ways to dissuade your opponent from doing it."
judo,2wr6mx,MrStretchnuts,3,Sun Feb 22 13:35:07 2015 UTC,I agree. You can make an art out of everything. Including turtling or even getting people out of it. It actually gives me a kind of satisfaction managing to throw a turtler over. However I still feel slightly insulted when during a fight the other guy just turns his back on me and stops fighting. I think Gluckmann's post would probably be the best solution.
judo,2wr6mx,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Sun Feb 22 14:28:50 2015 UTC,"I can understand the feeling of being insulted and I agree that u/Gluckmann has some good ideas about it.  If a player pulls a turtle simply to stall for time, that's against the competitive spirit of the sport and yes, should be penalised. Where it needs to be tempered is that in shiai, sometimes (not always) turtling is the only reasonable alternative to being submitted or held down. I don't think it's overly fair to penalise a player in that situation although a good argument can be made that if the player had been more aggressive or made fewer mistakes, they wouldn't be in that position and should therefore be penalised for it..."
judo,2wr6mx,MrStretchnuts,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"You must be pretty inexperienced or are a fucktard moron. Try that knuckling shit to the ear and neck very often during newaza randori at any respectable dojo and you will get an equal amount of unpleasant tactics returned to you. If not by the randori partner you tried it on, then by the line up of dojo BAMFs the sensei will arrange for you to do randori with until you learn some dojo etiquette."
judo,2wr6mx,DoorsofPerceptron,3,Sun Feb 22 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for 21 years and the last 11 of those have been at international level, so I guess by your standards I must be a fucktard moron.  The Dojos where I train are more geared towards competitive players, so tactics like those aren't punished nor are they considered poor Dojo etiquette. Particularly if your opponent pulls a defensive move like a turtle.  If your Sensei(s) discourage that behaviour, that's cool. Not having cauliflower ears means you'll always be pretty, and that's important in today's day and age :-)  I'm not sure what a line up of Dojo BAMFs is, but it sure sounds scary. I'll be sure to show that the proper respect if we ever have the pleasure of training together and I knuckle your ears. Please know I'd only ever do that out of love and not because you pulled a stalling tactic.  Looks like nobody else upvoted your comment yet (but there will probably be others who agree with you. They'll come in time), so here: have a free internet point from me for taking the time to reply to my suggestion, even if you didn't like it."
judo,2wr6mx,yknik,2,Sun Feb 22 22:16:27 2015 UTC,"Ha. Honestly, if people want to appreciate tactics like that, they should just roll with a grizzled 5th+ dan. There's real technical ability that goes into making these little tweaks hurt enough to break a stall or make someone flinch at just the right time.  It's definitely part of the art."
judo,2wr6mx,MrStretchnuts,2,Sun Feb 22 23:39:47 2015 UTC,"The first competition coach I had used to love his painful techniques:   Rubbing the top of his head against your forehead and face during randori Making a fist beneath your back in osaekomi then squeezing whenever you breathed in Grinding the knuckles into your collarbone in kumikata Knuckling the ear The ude garami takedown (now illegal) Ude gaeshi   The guy has a sadistic streak a mile wide. Wouldn't have changed my training with him for the world.  He's definitely grizzled and last year, he got his fifth dan."
judo,2wr6mx,yknik,2,Mon Feb 23 03:49:45 2015 UTC,"That takes me back.  I used to wrestle before judo, and one of the older guys used to drive the top of his head into everyone. But he was completely bald, and one of the popular counters was to tuck your chin down and sweep it left to right across the top of his head, giving him stubble rash.  That and we used to pick people off the floor with a standing ude-garami variation that led beautifully into a sweep."
judo,2wr6mx,Azuriem,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:23:15 2015 UTC,"Well maybe I'm a fucktard moron for thinking that kind of shit wouldn't be acceptable at every dojo in the world. Maybe your dojo is a particularly hard ass dojo. Newbs should probably find out if sadistically knuckling at every practice is within etiquette, otherwise they may get told, one way or another, that their dojo is not as hard ass as playing for 21 years and the last 11 of those have been at international level MrStrechnuts.   ps. Honest question, how does one do judo for 21 years with the last 11 of those at international level and stay at shodan? I myself am only shodan, but I was only on the national team once, and that was as a juvenile."
judo,2wr6mx,IFeelLikeBasedGod,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:18:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I try not to use knuckling or any of the other painful techniques on new Judoka or those who I don't think can handle it. They're reserved for the more experienced players and those who want to learn the more competitive style that we tend to teach.  That being said, i've been guilty of doing it to a few particularly aggravating junior men players coming up through the ranks. One of them kicked me repeatedly in the head trying to do that jujigatame turnover where you push your back leg through the gap and use your front leg and torsion on the arm to turn Uke over. That was his response to my turtling. When he did the same, I knuckled him. Turnabout is fair play and i'm happy to report we went and got beers afterwards and whinged about our various hurty parts.  And yes, the three dojos I train at are geared to competitive players. Randori and drills take up most of the training time. There are clubs in the area that cater to those who are learning or those who just want to train for fitness and fun where I'd never dream of knuckling the ears or doing some of the more risky throws like ude gaeshi, but I only ever attend them for seminars and the occasional guest coaching role or similar.  In answer to your question regarding the grade, it's equal parts laziness and circumstance. I missed out on Olympic selection in 2007 and took a five year break to concentrate on my career. Since returning, I simply haven't bothered to grade.  I've got the competition points in spades but badly need to brush up on my kata. Will be doing that this year.

It's more like Judo newaza then BJJ however they are more skilled on the basic's and have alot of BJJ sweeps and leglocks from your normal Judoka's I have seen. Will be hard to find. I think the guy was from Tokyo or some other places.
judo,2wneka,yknik,2,Sat Feb 21 12:08:57 2015 UTC,That looks incredibly risky.
judo,2wneka,jujiroll,2,Sat Feb 21 13:20:12 2015 UTC,"Appears white was applying a choke from the top, blue was forced to turn or would have had to tap."
judo,2wneka,Suey13,2,Sat Feb 21 18:19:37 2015 UTC,"As it's hard to see, here's my step-by-step guide:   left hand under ukes left arm as far as you can to ukes right neck/shoulder area grab your right sleeve with your left hand and grab ukes gi at the front of his left shoulder with your right. move from ukes back to the teopof his head (your head pointing to ukes left side and uke centered somewhere in your belly area. lay on your right side, turn into hulk and turn uke over. as soon as uke is turned more than 50%, move your feet in a counter-clockwise motion, so uke doesn't come down on you, and you are turned on your front."
judo,2wneka,Hippocampus88,3,Sat Feb 21 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"Cool turnover from White, but what on earth was Blue thinking? White repeatedly gave him opportunities to take half-guard control from the top, but he just kept trying to turtle up. No attempt to defend the hooks, either."
judo,2wneka,Scrofuloid,2,Sat Feb 21 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"The initial technique that white is attempting is actually extremely effective.  From the back you reach under uke's left arm and grasp the shoulder near the neck while your left foot slides inbetween the legs from the left side and you go on your left side.  You must have ahold of uke's gi on the right side, and bridge/pull them over onto their back, bring your left knee in to escape the scissor, and you have the pin.  Try it sometime."
judo,2wneka,Suey13,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks weird  but it works. It looks kind of like uke can take half guard but he can't because of the grips."

judo,2wneka,sasquatch007,3,Sat Feb 21 23:48:13 2015 UTC,"Even from a judo perspective this was strange. In judo, if you are trying to defend on the ground, getting half guard is very valuable as once you lock it in you will almost certainly get a stand up from the ref.

What is not OK is doing so within the same legal entity. One has to create or affiliate with another one. This is because the federation wants to keep being the judo federation, not the MMA federation, and does not want the legal trouble of dealing with MMA. This looks perfectly reasonable.  Edit: Also, creating the legal entity ('association loi 1901') is free. It's just paperwork. Most Judo club will probably let the teacher host the other course in the dojo for free."

This is good enough a reason to forbid teachers from teaching other sports within the legal framework of a Judo Club.  This is not primarily about MMA being illegal or not, this is about the Judo federation  not wanting to adopt yet another sport (they already have Ju-jitsu and Kendo IIRC). What they are saying is : If you want to train for MMA, do it in your own club.  Legblocks are illegal under the federation rules, if somebody breaks your leg doing one, you can launch a civil lawsuit. A teacher that teaches and encourages his students to do legblocks would be barred from the federation as well. This is not about MMA specifically, but about anything that isn't Judo."

judo,2wmwf2,fleischlaberl,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:48:22 2015 UTC,In training?  Yeah at high level tournaments people get injured and don't always get up.    The danger in mma is mostly head trauma. But most fights get away with that being not much of an issue.   You can disagree with me.  I think all Combat sports have similar chances of you ending up dead.    Boxing probably has the highest due the really extensive head trauma and Length of matches that's the worst.  But in judo or wrestling you can have several matches a day and I've seen my fair share of torn acls and broken bones at them.    You don't have to be rude units yours like to show some stat that proves in wrong and even then you can be polite.  Combat sports are all dangerous.  Judo being up there.
judo,2wmwf2,jujiroll,8,Mon Feb 23 01:01:13 2015 UTC,"I sometimes think r/judo is becoming a bit of an ideological echo chamber when it comes to these issues, so I am going to try and play devils advocate.  Firstly, there are the commonly repeated claims that the IJF are destroying Judo, making it increasingly irrelevant and that it is 'dying out' as a result. Fortunately, this is not the case.   Internationally, participation is actually on the increase. In Brazil Judo, and not BJJ, is the most widely practiced martial art (outside of Rio, which is something of a global hub for BJJ). Whilst the emergence of countries such as Mongolia on the world circuit in the last few years shows that competition at the elite level is closer than ever. Further, since the Grand Prix circuit started in 2007 there are now a greater number of larger events than there have ever been. Well attended events at that, with arena that are full several days in a row. Which has amongst other things led to a steady increase in the earning potential for the best Judoka, with prize money on offer at these events increasing exponentially in recent years. Another hugely positive and relatively recent development is that most of these top tier events are also streamed live to most parts of the world, for free.   Just because Judo is suffering in the US and UK, does not mean that this is the case globally. I would also say that this is not really the fault of the IJF, but rather the incompetent NGB's that we are sadly lumbered with.  It is also worth pointing out that MMA competition still remains illegal in France (not saying I agree with this) and as such, is it really surprising when something like this is announced? It is easy to sensationalise, but sometimes it is better to keep wider contexts in mind."
judo,2wmwf2,OutOfThBottomlessPit,3,Sat Feb 21 11:48:04 2015 UTC,"I fully agree abut the echo chamber. I think that situation is par for the course when you have a small community like this. Just because it is an echo chamber doesn't necessarily mean that the views being expressed are wrong, but it does mean that we should make some extra effort to consider other sides of the story and try and look at all evidence available.   Internationally, participation is actually on the increase.   I'd be interested in seeing what the real numbers are on this. I know that not so long ago my NGB was sending out letters boasting about their own record numbers of registered members, yet I could see myself that a lot of clubs were struggling and then about a year later they were cancelling quite a few competitions due to lack of participation.   It turned out that the ""record numbers"" were more down to them making the clubs get absolutely every kid that stepped on the mat registered (for insurance reasons, of course) and the real numbers of participants hadn't really increased.  I've been training long enough that I have seen BJJ go from being a fairly obscure style to being one of the most common ones in my area with the largest schools. Yet if you asked for the number of registered BJJ students, you wouldn't be able to get accurate numbers at all as there is no association. (Well, actually there is an association but no one wants to join it.)  What I can tell you is that the classes are packed, and there are so many tournaments I can't keep track of them all. In the judo world, outside of a few clubs, it seem that most are poorly attended and lots of tournaments have been cancelled due to lack of attendance.  That is just my country, and I realise that I shouldn't generalise, but that is my experience.  As to incompetent NGBs, I think you are right and this is a real problem. The thing is thought that a lot of the NGBs seem to be incompetent, and even with the ones that are considered competent, there seems to be a lot that just focus on developing competitive judo players and leave the grass-roots in the dark.  I'm in Ireland, and a lot of foreign guys who train with me tell me that they are amazed that they can come and train as adults just for fun. I've been told by a Brazilian, a Spaniard, and a Pole that you can usually only start training as a kid there, and unless you are winning competitions you are not encouraged to continue training as an adult.  I hate to be one of those people who go on about Kano soke's wishes, but the guy was against competition being a huge focus in judo. It was supposed to be part of your training, a tool to help sharpen you up, to test you both mentally and physically. Now it is the end goal as far as most organisations are concerned.   I don't think that judo ever reached the level of world wide popularity where the NGB's could sit back and concentrate on just regulating competition, yet that seems to be what has happened for a lot of them. I've seen the sudden rise of BJJ from being a niche to being a pretty common style. I've seen wrestling be removed from the Olympics - briefly anyway. The one-on-one nature of Judo means that it will always face the threat of being removed from the Olympics to make way for an event where they can get the whole thing done in a few heats.   I think a lot of people feel that judo will outlast the MMA fad, and they may even be right, but it is in no way a certainty, and I don't think it is a good plan to just dismiss it as some barbaric side show."
judo,2wmwf2,Pyronaut44,1 point,Mon Feb 23 11:29:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points. I make similar observations in germany. Judo is recognized as a child sport here (with a few fighters as ""elite""). The syllablus is made for judoka who start their journey with 6 to 9. Several very important (but somewhat advanced) principles about judo (technique-wise and randori) never reach the grass-roots. The dropout rate when judoka reach adultness is huge."

Maybe judo isn't dying out, but the emergence of said countries (like mongolia, georgia, etc.) is imho not caused by the love for judo, furthermore because being a elite judoka is a chance for the people living there to rise on the social ladder. Become Olympic Champion in Mongolia and your life is set. Lucky for the individual, but this is not really the purpose of judo.  Regarding Grand Prix circuits: i would like to see hard data for this. When I watch judo on youtube I often see half empty arenas except for competitions in France, Japan or other countries were judo is something like a national sport.  I tend to agree with you regarding ""incompetent NGBs"" (you mean the national judo federation for each judo country?). But at least here in germany, i can't expect anything from the NGB regarding anything non-olympic-judo related because the German federation is under the german olympic federation, so the main goal of the NGB is to get olympic medals.  The whole IJF circus around Marius Vizer is like FIFA and Joseph Blatter only smaller: Sport business. In the end, no matter if there also happen to be ""good things"" for judo, they are only gonna happen if there is money for the IJF-officials. The whole IJF-idea of judo is inherently flawed."

The past two and current Yokozuna (grand masters and reigning champions) are all from Mongolia.  Also there has been a large influx of wrestlers from Georgia, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, etc.  A lot of traditionalist (i.e. borderline racist) Japanese scratch their heads and say ""when are we going to have a native Japanese champion again?""  The answer is probably never, at least as long as the current world socioeconomic situation doesn't significantly change.  It's the same reason why the majority of pro basketball players come from poor, black, and urban neighborhoods, or why so many world-class sprinters come from Jamaica, or world class marathon runners come from Kenya and Ethiopia.  These are all cases where excelling in a sport can catapult you from 3rd-world living conditions to 1st-world comfort and standard of living.

The reason for the rule changes is that there was a lot of stalling in high level competition, and lots of fighting in bent over stances to keep the other guy from grabbing at your legs. The new rules extremely limit grip fighting and prohibit touching the legs in order to encourage big throws from upright stances and a sleeve and collar grip, like you see in old school judo.  There is another, unstated reason: people with wrestling experience (especially from Eastern European and Asian countries with strong folk wrestling traditions) were becoming too successful, to the point that olympic judo was beginning to look like wrestling in a gi. So the IJF got scared that judo would be cut from the olympics, and they would lose all that sweet tv income.  At my dojo we fortunately train by the old rules, but the general consensus is that the no leg grab thing does cripple the self defense value of the art, and judo is indeed on its way to become the TKD of grappling."
judo,2whz5f,SVPPB,3,Fri Feb 20 02:11:14 2015 UTC,"That's a bummer. I don't mean to beat a dead horse. I was honestly hoping that someone would come in here and give an optimistic answer with some reasons that I hadn't considered.   For instance the big upright throws might be better than a double for self defense because it is easier to remain standing from them if your opponent is less skilled, and they would damage an assailant more."
judo,2whz5f,SVPPB,4,Fri Feb 20 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"That does make sense. I've heard people say that specializing on upright throws is better for self defense because it's the kind of grappling that would occur in the clinch, whereas the bent over wrestling stance leaves you open to punches.  There may be some truth to that, but personally, I don't think it compensates for the loss of throws like te guruma and morote gari. Moreover, grabbing the legs is a very instinctive self defense move, and you should be prepared for your opponent to resort to it."

There's no leg grabs in Boxing for example, and boxing is arguably the best thing to learn for dedicated self defence (after running...).

Also, while I do agree automatic hansoku-make is a bit harsh, I'm one of the few that don't mind the new rule set. I was a wrestler first before I picked up Judo, and let me tell you, the new rule set really forced me to improve my Judo. Instead of going for easy double legs, single legs or fireman's carries, I really had to polish my seoi-nage, tai-otoshi and uchimata. Furthermore, leg grabbing techniques are such a small part of Judo, I don't understand why people complain it too much. In my personal opinion, if your tokui-waza was double legs or single legs, you were doing Judo wrong anyway."

But I soon realized the new rule set actually forced me to break away from the wrestling mentality and explore other beautiful techniques in Judo, so I don't use those leg grabbing techniques anymore, b/c honestly you don't have to!"

People in this sub tend to really emphasize self defense and effectiveness of a martial art, but in this day and age, what does that mean?

If you're thinking of the latter, TKD, boxing, Muay Thai, Judo, BJJ and etc all can do that for you.   Well, yes. I feel that a martial art should serve you well in case you ever need to defend yourself.  Current WTF TKD rules reward high spinning kicks, ridiculous foot-fencing, strongly discourage punching, forbid clinching, and encourage fighters to keep their hands low. Strikes have to be only powerful enough to score, and the bout is stopped after each point. All those rules arguably make for a compelling sport, but create very poor habits for self defense.   In the same vein, fencing has become less of a simulated sword fight, and evolved as a sport with its own rules, that would probably get you skewered in a real duel.  Frankly, I'm afraid judo may very well follow the same path."

I think judo is still highly effective without leg grabbing attacks in terms of self defense."
judo,2whz5f,sasquatch007,3,Fri Feb 20 19:46:03 2015 UTC,I believe the assertion is not that a judoka must practice leg grabs to be effective in self defense. It's that a judoka must practice defense against leg grab attacks.

TKD is a beautiful art, and it teaches kicks that may haver never been learned or developed without the very specific ruleset that they have developed. My issue is more that I want an art that is a sport while not sacrificing fundamental self-defense qualities.  I know there are still traditional TKD schools that spar hard, and there are practitioners who emphasize hard hits and punches to the head; but unfortunately because of the ruleset most schools are incentivized not emphasize these skills."
judo,2whz5f,DoorsofPerceptron,3,Fri Feb 20 22:47:11 2015 UTC,"It's all about the big ippons. If you watch really advanced judo, over time it's evolved into a much more defensive sport. If you can get some small yukos and you force your opponent to get penalties, then all you have to do is freeze your opponent out until time.   All of the new rules are geared towards forcing action. And avoiding looking like wrestling. I'll admit, the leg grabs rule sucks, but if it makes the pros work a little harder at their sport, I support it."
judo,2whz5f,judokalinker,4,Fri Feb 20 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"I think the rules on ipon winning the match drive people towards a more defensive judo anyway.   If you could go in for a big exciting technique that will score an ipon two out of three times, but leaves you open to a large counter, it makes sense to instead go for a small safe throw that will never get ipon, but doesn't expose you to an ipon counter.  On the other hand, if the match just continues and they count the ipons at the end, it favours risky techniques that frequently pay off."

Ask them to teach you some of the banned stuff and many will be happy to! If they don't (probably for the sake of the rest of the class) find somewhere doing freestyle Judo or even Sambo. If you ever go to Japan, make the Kodokan your first stop.  Only downside is, kiss any hopes for regular competition goodbye.

Wrestling has changed many rules to 'force action' and BJJ is now looking to stop stalling also.   We are also seeing a time where people are cross training like never before. 25 years ago when I wrestled in high school there was maybe 1 or 2 Judo players in wrestling. Now there are multiple people who train wrestling, Judo, or BJJ in any given class that I am in.   My schools Master is a red belt in BJJ and a black belt in Judo. We learn Judo throws a few times a week. The school offers wrestling one day a week. We are considered a BJJ team, but we do wrestling and Judo. Some of us do MMA also.   This leads to issues to keeping each sport unique as opposed to them becoming one grappling art. Its ironic that grappling is more popular now than ever do to its practical use in fighting, but to keep this popularity growing the sports commissions are looking to make it more of an entertainment sport.   That being said this is not the first time that this has happened. Look at the history of catch wrestling. The carnivals used to have open fights to anyone in town who could beat their fighter. They learned catch wrestling and would always win these fights. Eventually the sport grew, but they decided that catch wrestling was not exciting enough.

Once I have my other leg locked over my straight one, I rotate back right to the front.  2 You're going to want to keep his trapped arm either straight in front of him, or across his/your chest. This keeps the pressure on his neck. If he can rotate it backwards, or pull it out somehow, you've lost the pressure.  3 You're going to be adding three kinds of squeezing to finish it, and missing one makes it MUCH harder to finish. You're going to squeeze your knees together (most important one I think), you're going to pull your top foot down over your ""straight leg"" (the one against his neck), and then you're going to squeeze your abs and do a sit up/crunch. This essentially does the same thing as pulling the head, but from the front, instead of the back. If you really feel the need to grab the head, you're probably missing one of those 3 squeezes. If you've checked and made sure all 3 are squeezing and you're still not getting it, reach up and grab your own knee and pull it down. You will be much less likely to get a foul."

judo,2whcnh,SVPPB,2,Thu Feb 19 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"As you said, it works fine as long as you keep holding his trapped arm crossed.  If he is laying on his side, you should also use your free arm to control his body, so he doesn't wiggle out of the choke."

We've had a green belt kid come back to Judo after a five year hiatus to finish his schooling and degree. He's 21 or 22 now and about to become a physiotherapist. He moves pretty fast and doesn't seem to have forgotten anything technique wise, although we still need to teach him the new rules for competition.  A few nights ago during randori he tried breaking my lapel grip with both hands. I relaxed a bit and let go of his sleeve with my left hand to explain about the new rules. I started to say ""So they've changed the gripping rules..."" and before I could finish the sentence he spun in beneath me for the cleanest yama-arashi I've ever been thrown with. Seriously, it was picture-perfect. Absolutely textbook stuff.  I first started teaching that little shit when he was twelve. I was impressed, although I'll have to have a quiet chat with him about throwing me around like a rag doll when I'm explaining stuff."

judo,2wdi8q,silvaphysh13,2,Thu Feb 19 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"Thats good and bad at the same time ...  Mifune shows good movements to shift his COG (in the old times you would say ""hara"" ) BUT this is a prearranged demonstration to show specific moves of tai sabaki (body movement) to avoid a throw via shifting your own COG. Whats the aim of tai sabaki? At first to keep your COG allways within the support (rooted feet). Second to move your opponent and unbalancing him. If you are really good in this you move the opponent with your COG and with your feet - and not via pulling and pushing with the arms. The arms are like a chain - sometimes loose and sometimes a bar (working via your shoulders together with your COG).  The strenght of a human body is in the center/hips/limbs and in the legs and not in the arms. Even in boxing the power of a strike comes throm the legs and the hips and the lower back and not from biceps or triceps.  By the way: The ""old man"" in the video was a very strong man in his youth. Like all ""old masters"" see Kimura, Tokio Hirano and others.  ."
judo,2wdi8q,Ditdajow1,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"I would agree, though I'm not sure how pre-arranged everything is. Spot-on observation about COG, though. I always tell beginners to grab onto me, tightly, and don't let go. Then, I release my grip completely, take a large circle step, and hit them with a big ko-uchi-gari. I find it's a useful, simple demonstration of how arm strength is not the end goal, or the means to achieve kuzushi. Furthermore, I also agree on the videos of Hirano and Kimura, those were some tough old dudes!"

So get ability to strip grip is a combination of get leverage knowledge abd her strength for her size, especially since she does it against bigger people."

judo,2w7h0b,JudoBewbs,3,Tue Feb 17 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"Hi, good luck in the competition. The first thing I would say to you is get plenty of rest before the day. Some people might disagree with this and say go mad and train really hard the night before but if it's me I like to rest and not train the day before. There's nothing worse than competing with sore and tired muscles.   Also make sure you get plenty of food so you aren't hungry before the fight but have it earlier so you aren't full up. Cereal,pasta,meat, fruit, veg are some examples and a little bit of chocolate/sweets can't harm you! Just don't go over board:)  In terms of the fights, get a good warm up. I like to do some jogging, rolling, uchi Komi, nage komi, gripping, moving and newaza techniques and progress them into a small fight-like situation. My coaches always said after your warm up it should feel like you've already fought your first fight. Not sure if everyone will agree but this warm up always prepared me:)   When you go on to fight, think positively. You wouldn't be fighting the Nationals if you weren't good enough! Don't rush anything, during the right things might not be going your way or you can't get attacks in. Just take your time and it will come, move your opponent and try break up their balance.   I can't tell you what throws/combinations you should do since I don't know you but there is lots of choices for you. Id stick to ones you've practiced but sometimes things can happen out of no where. Break up techniques like ouchi/kouchi Gari and heeza guruma may be good to use if you do a hip throw.   Sorry for the long text..don't think about it too much and enjoy yourself!

judo,2w7h0b,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Tue Feb 17 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"The point is to make your conditioning as close to competition as possible.  If you're into running tabata training or high intensity interval training is closest to competition. You should be looking at sprinting for 20 seconds, then jogging for 10 and repeat for the duration of the match (plus stoppage time) then stop make sure you recover fully and do it again.

We always want an absolute answer for an in-absolute problem, or in this case, an ideology that you are trying to extract. Fresh-Dodo responded exactly how most of us who have begun to understood the concept of using your own body to move uke by saying that there is no forward movement = backwards throw and vice versa. Judo, or any martial art for that matter, is never a combination of equations that you can integrate together to guarantee a desired outcome.  Let's use a real example for the sake of this argument. I'm going to assume you understand how a canonical seoi nage is executed. The ""ideal"" seoi nage involves moving backwards and using a fast backwards sweeping motion with your back leg to turn and generate torque. However, you can also execute a seoi nage by pushing your opponent backwards so that you begin walking forward, and the moment he pushes back into you, you step in a for a seoi nage. Although the throw is a uchi mata, the concept still applies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMCDglwY_CA go to 2:50 and notice how Ebinuma causes the uke to shuffle step backwards and lean forwards; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beWCLHaGyxM go to 2:51, tori is walking forward executing a uchi. Effectively, you are using his momentum against yours, yet you two are moving in the opposite direction of the ""proper"" seoi nage.   Lastly, let's think of executing a seoi nage going sideways. Let's assume you are a righty and you are sidestepping together to your left, when you hit your stride and uke's weight is on his right foot, you cross step in front of him, turning your shoulders and hips while loading him/her onto your shoulder/back. This throw will look more like the uke is doing a cartwheel as opposed to uke doing a front flip over the shoulders.*   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yTnOMhxX_4#t=86 this is a good video that shows a lot of great examples of throws being applied going in directions ""opposite"" of the canonical forms that you see during demonstration *at 2:00 you can see a morote seoi being applied while the uke is moving sideways"

Let your uke place his hand (in a fist) on your palm, he may not let go of the contact between your hand and his.  Now move around slowly, move in circles, you on the inside, him on the outside.  You will soon get the feeling of you controlling him and you will feel when the opportunity comes for a throw.  Now note that you are doing this without pulling or pushing uke, you are ""only"" moving about, this is the importance of tai-sabaki.  ""Don't move your partner, move yourself."""
judo,2vyven,fleischlaberl,-1,Sun Feb 15 13:28:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your insight. However this does not answer my question. Perhaps I was not clear enough. From what I know, one part of Judo is using the opponents momentum against him self. That is why I ask, what attacks are available if uke is moving backwards and tori forward (ignore the pushing and pulling reference I made earlier as it is irrelevant) What attacks are available if uke is moving forward and tori backward. What attacks are available if tori and uke are sidestepping."
judo,2vyven,H2Outbreak,4,Sun Feb 15 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do know what you asked but it's not really that simple.  I can give you a list but it will not be a ""true"" list.  Example: You can do a right-handed osoto-gari when uke moves backwards, forwards and sideways.  This also applies to a number of other throws. It depends on your skill."
judo,2vyven,Ionya1337,1 point,Sun Feb 15 14:19:19 2015 UTC,"""Example: You can do a right-handed osoto-gari when uke moves backwards, forwards and sideways.""  Very good answer - but allways the weight of uke is on his right foot heel.  Most important for throws to look at is not were the legs are and in which direction uke and tori are moving but to look at were the weight of uke is: balanced? right or left? toes or heels? outside or inside?  Good Judo depends a lot on good tai sabaki (body movement for defending and attacking) and on understanding, were the COD (center of gravity) is shifting and then on decisiviness and technique (waza).  ."
judo,2vyven,bull_in_chinashop,-1,Sun Feb 15 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"I found a nice article partially explaining the situation at hand.  http://judoinfo.com/movement2.htm The Mutual Relationship of Throwing and Movement Directions in Judo: When one scrutinizes the repertoire of judo throws, it becomes apparent that most throws will fall into a particular 'Direction of Throwing' category. To be specific, the direction of throw is that which exists at the moment of kake and relates to the opponent and not the attacker.  Throws such as Harai Goshi, Koshi Guruma, Tsurikomi Goshi, and O Goshi are techniques with a throwing direction generally to the opponent's right or left fcont comers, depending on the attacker's gripping preference.  Throws such as O Soto Gari, O Uchi Gari, and Ko Soto Gari result in a throwing direction generally to the opponent's right or left rear comers.  Before discussing the issue of the mutual relationship of throwing and movement directions, some comments are warranted regarding what is known as attacking and throwing spaces.  When referring to space as it relates to the two players, it is basically the space existing between the two players at any given moment. The two common spatial terms are known as the attacking and throwing spaces.  An attacker prior to launching into a throwing technique normally requires maximum attacking space between the two players. This then allows the attacker to generate the necessary momentum to pull off the technique.  At the instant kake is reached, the space between the two players is minimal or zero, depending on the type of technique attempted. This space is the throwing space.  For the two players standing in a natural posture, the natural attacking space would be full extension of the arms. This space is affected to some degree if the player(s) adopted a crouching (jigotai) posture and/or some shoulder rotation was evident.  A common belief among some judo practitioners is the philosophy that it is best to attempt to throw the opponent to his/her front (right, left or direct) while the defender is moving backward.  The author believes that this thinking is based on the premise that the attacking space is maximized when the opponent moves away from the attacker. This of course is not true. As indicated earlier, attacking space is controlled solely by the hands/arms. Therefore, direction of movement does not govern the attacking space.  To illustrate the mutual relationship that exists between the throwing and movement directions we will examine O Soto Gari and Seoi Nage. These are examples of forward and rearward throwing direction techniques. O Soto Gari will be examined first.  When the attacker and defender hereafter called 'A' and 'B' respectively, are moving, and no pulling or pushing exists, the two players for all practical purposes move as an entity. The total momentum thus generated can be said to be speed of movement multiplied by the sum of the two body masses. Let us now consider that 'A' attacks 'B' while 'B' is moving backward. In this case the throwing direction matches the direction of movement and the direction of the generated momentum. What 'A' now has to do is close the attacking space followed by a tightening up of the throwing space. To accomplish this, 'A' needs to slightly increase his own momentum while 'B' is still moving backward. Thus the overall momentum is increased without any disturbance to that which already existed for 'B'. At the instant the power point (Kake) is reached in the attack, (where 'B's leg is reaped away) maximum force will be achieved. The power point was thus reached without a change in movement direction or momentum of player 'B'.  The same attack (O Soto Gari), made while 'B' moves forward is a different situation. The throwing direction is unchanged. 'B' is to be thrown to the rear. It will be readily noticed that 'B's direction of momentum must now be changed. In order to throw 'B' to the rear, 'A' has to offset the forward momentum of 'B'. 'A' must still close the attacking space as in the previous example. But he also has to in effect reduce the forward momentum of 'B' to zero, then build it up again in the opposite direction! Therefore 'A' is required to do far more work to achieve the same result. We can conclude from this that it is far more effective in terms of energy output to make a rear throw while the defender is moving to the rear.  When Seoi Nage is examined, the rationale for determining the energy output of 'A' is similar. A basic difference for Seoi Nage requires that 'A' turn his body to perhaps a full half turn. This is a physiological requirement imposed on 'A' to effect the technique. The throwing requirements remain essentially the same (i.e. driving leg, attacking leg, if required, locking hand, etc...). Again, if 'A' were to attempt to throw 'B' forward while 'B' was moving backward, the same problem arises as that encountered while attempting O Soto Gari while 'B' is moving forward. That is, the direction of momentum must be changed in order to throw 'B' forward.  From the foregoing, we can conclude that minimum energy requirements are met when 'A' throws 'B' to the rear when 'B' moves backwards or throws 'B' forward as 'B' moves forward.  The foregoing observations are based on scientific principles. It must be remembered that no two individuals are alike and that judo skill is made to fit the individual and not vice versa. If students feel better and find it easier to do techniques which appear to violate scientific principles they should not be coerced into changing their method of approach.  Finally, consider the Nage No Kata. Every technique in this form complies with minimum energy requirements. That is, throwing direction matches the Uke's direction of movement.  One throw in the Nage No Kata would apparently appear to contradict the foregoing discussion for justifying the existence of the mutual relationship of throwing and movement directions.  That throw is Yoko Guruma. This is one of the four blow throws with Uke moving forward to attack tori. The defensive/offensive moves of tori involve his first attempting Ura Nage followed by Yoko Guruma. Uke's reaction to the Ura Nage attempt by tori momentarily reduces his momentum to zero. However, he generates an opposing force to the Ura Nage which allows the tori to attack with Yoko Guruma. Uke's resultant Ukemi impact zone is basically directly to either his direct right or left of his initial direction of movement.  In formulating the Nage No Kata, Dr. Kano has presented a classic example of his judo maxim of ""Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort"". No throws are made in a direction opposite to the Uke's direction of movement!  Simplified answer: uke moving back = Osoto gari. Uke Forward Ogosi or Ippon seionage."
judo,2vyven,kenbu,3,Sun Feb 15 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"Simplified answer: Tori moving forward = Osoto gari. Tori Backward Ogosi or Ippon seionage.   No. Uke moving backwards = Osoto gari, Uke moving forwards, O-goshi or Ippon Seoi nage.  No, that is not the same thing. You have to understand the difference.  Note that these are general directions, not absolute directions."
judo,2vyven,jonoy52,1 point,Sun Feb 15 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"What attacks are available if uke is moving forward and tori backward.   It's not a matter of gross movements in a given direction.  For example, seoi nage is considered a ""forward"" throw.  That does NOT mean uke needs to be walking or pushing forward into you.  Uke can be retreating backwards.  If you move with uke and sublty push his center of gravity (COG) backwards over his feet, uke will react by attempting to move his COG forward back to center... This is when you can off balance him further forward and enter for seoi nage."

The idea of having an 'advantage' shouldn't really be entering into your mindset when you are practicing techniques and doing uchi-komi etc. If people aren't able to practice and develop their judo because I am wearing a cardboard-collared gi which prevents them from getting a proper grip, then I am failing as a training partner and denying my partner the courtesy they have showed me of helping to develop their techniques.   Of course, if it's a bit harder to grip me in competition, I don't mind :P but generally you should want to help your training partners - it's the same reason for why when you are being an uke you don't stiffen up or squirm out of people's techniques when they are trying to develop them. There's a time for advantages/disadvantages/resisting/'wrecking people's grips', and that is called randori or shiai."

It started with trying to preserve the spirit of judo in competition by refining rules to make it so that judo purists weren't getting manhandled in our own competitions, which was in itself due to a lack of well-rounded training because of said fear of other martial arts invading and corrupting the underlying concepts of judo. Now we're in a period where we're actively shunning marketing and recognition because of arbitrary values.  Like it or not, judoka like Ronda dominating in a sport like UFC only seed the interest of future judoka.

According to sensei, IJF prohibits anything under brown (or black, not sure) from doing arm locks (anything other than chokes).   ... You have a very strange sensei...! There are rules for kids and youths, not to use arm locks or chokes, but the grown ups are allowed to use them.

Doesn't sound like the IJF rules.   the way we drilled tani otoshi (back in my V1 training) was as a counter to seoi nage. Is this wrong?   No, that's okay. Tani Otoshi is commonly used as a counter technique for many throws. One shouldn't rely on it too much though.    Ah. The way I learned it was to reap the far leg/foot similar to how you would reap for kosoto gari/kouchi gari. Is this incorrect?   Well, it can work, but it is not how it is supposed to be done. Tori's leg is not stretched to block uke's legs, it is stretched to shift tori's center of mass along a vector pointing down and backwards from uke.

Look how he uses his leg to shift his weight past uke and downwards:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B166K9X-wDA  The problem with getting close to uke's legs is the risk of injury.

When done correctly with a properly instructed uke they are as safe as all the other throws.   That was my understanding.  In the V1 iteration we did learn the standing kata guruma with a really thick mat to throw them on (we only used this to learn tomoe nage), specifically for learning the throw (in case it was done wrong).  Once we had done it a few times we could then do it it on the normal mats.   ... You have a very strange sensei...! There are rules for kids and youths, not to use arm locks or chokes, but the grown ups are allowed to use them. I also understand prohibiting whitebelts from using such techniques, but other than that... weird. Doesn't sound like the IJF rules.   Yeah.  His training seems a little inverse (not backwards or broken).  The way he teaches (techniques) is good, but he teaches things in the reverse order, I feel.  I asked him for ""counter techniques"" (which other sensei have always happily shown them from time to time to me), and he said he doesn't go over counter techniques until shodan minimum.  So, hypothetically, if I'm competing in an IJF event, I may be able to sacrifice during a tournament without getting disqualified?  The sacrifice is something I don't plan on doing, I just want to know the rules.  I tried reading the 2014 IJF rules, but it's really long so I watched the youtube video of it.  It doesn't seem to say that I can't do them.  Most of it seems to be built around pacing of the match.   Well, it can work, but it is not how it is supposed to be done.

Is ushiro goshi frowned upon (in the same way as tani otoshi) as a counter to a blocked seoi nage?

judo,2vwmrv,flyingkneebar,1 point,Sun Feb 15 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"Relax a little. You worry too much about too many things. :)  Under IJF rules you can use all judo throws in tournament, except for those where you touch uke's body below the belt with your hands (which is a stupid rule, that has nothing to do with safety) and some rare throws you probably never practiced (kani basami, kawazu gake).   Is ushiro goshi frowned upon   Ushiro goshi is mostly a counter technique (that works best against koshi guruma). There isn't anything wrong with counters in general. You shouldn't wait for a chance to counter all the time, but attack yourself. That's what some frown upon: People who are totally defensive and only wait for you to attack to counter you. One doesn't make progress that way and never learns to attack properly. But, if you can counter a throw, there's nothing wrong with doing so (except you want to help a beginner learn and allow him/her to throw you). Just don't be passive."

Double- and single leg takedowns are -unfortunately- forbidden in tournaments under the current IJF rules. That's what so many judoists ""bitch"" about as you say. The reasons for this have nothing to do with safety, but with ""visual attractiveness"". The IJF wants judo to be more popular on TV, which means more sponsors, which means more money. The leg grab ban is about money, nothing else. And every serious judoist should be against that stupid rule. It's not about ""bitching"", it's about defending our martial art against greedy people who hold positions they shouldn't have.  Judo has quite a number of techniques in their canon, that require touching the legs with the hands. All of them are fobidden now in IJF rule tournament. This includes:  Kibisu Gaeshi, Kushiki Taoshi, Morote Gari, Kata Guruma, Sukui Nage. Other throws can only be done in certain ways only (without touching the legs with the hands): Obi Otoshi, Ko Uchi Maki Komi, Tama Guruma. There may be others I just couldn't remember.  Kani Basami is forbidden due to a certain risk of injury: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1EFPB5IWqA  Same with Kawazu Gake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vElhU7dJSrE   Do you have a list?

judo,2vvdz7,fleischlaberl,5,Sat Feb 14 13:50:30 2015 UTC,Better technique means that the power you have is multiplied when the technique is done correctly.   100% power put into a technique that is done 100% correctly is much more efficient than putting 100% of power into 20% of the technique  That's the simplest explanation that I can give.

""seiryoku zenyo"" is the underlying and very unique to judo - but you can use this principle not only in judo but in everyday life.   To understand the principles of the techniques is a much better way than to ask for tricks like ""if - than"". But its also a limitation only to look at the mechanical principles, because in free practice (randori) you have to feel what works without thinking and analyzing.

As I don't train a lot and I'm past my super-competetive time, I would have a hard time learning new moves. New moves need to be done several thousand times to get into 'muscle memory'.  My consequence is, I focus on the few techniques I'm very good at (this is foot sweeps like de-ashi-barai and juji-gatame). I try to think of ways to make these things work. Either bring uke or myself into situations where I can apply these techniques.  I might not do big spectacular throws or compete on national level, but on my level I win most matches and in randori I can throw bigger guys from time to time and win most ne-waza randori even against heavier guys.  tl;dr the time I have to improve is limited, so I just improve the few things I am good at."

I do agree there are upper body take downs and throws that are underutilized but all those moves exist in wrestling.    Wrestling is the best base for mma. Mma is not in a gi. Wrestling is an overall more effective art than judo imo. And the talent level in wrestling seems a bit higher.   A lot of the great judoka that you might think of have wrestled at some point.    Judo is fantastic. One of my coaches is a black belt on judo as well and quite good and wrestled and I'd find it hard pressed for him to remotely think this. There are tons of amazing judo  That would be awesome in gi. But if the takedown works in no gi. Chances are it's wrestling.  Wrestlers don't only do shots.

You have No-Gi style takedowns so learning BJJ would come alot faster then somebody without any experience. Of course there are some bad habits you need to break but that's fine. Wrestling has good takedowns & defence and shoots from in/outside and also MMA takedowns get you points so yes for mma it's a good base. Judo is hard base to change for mma since out only 20% of the throws work however in the Gi it's a base for bjj over wrestling because Gi & No-Gi are different. Judo in the Gi & Wrestling for mma. However Judo is a tricky base in mma need to see more Judoka in the UFC but like I said for mma you need to know wrestling & BJJ anything after that is a pluse Judo,Sambo,Etc"
judo,2vucpn,caseharts,0,Sat Feb 14 09:56:54 2015 UTC,I must say it is a good article. Judo had tons of value in bjj and mma. In more ways than one and vice versa (judos political bs) I just think the issues in gi dealing with wrestlers dont disappear with judo. Wrestlers can shoot from out side and if you tie up in the stand you're going to get handled. Judo hand fighting isn't bad but in bjj while it is on a gi seems to be different. I think that's a lot in due part to everyone being bad a stand up but also the goal being different between the two positionaly.
judo,2vucpn,caseharts,-3,Sat Feb 14 10:18:28 2015 UTC,You did say that but I disagree with judo being better for gi in ways to but totally recognize the other side of that.  I don't think that learning judo because you're getting taken down by wrestlers is necessarily  the best idea.  Judo players have tons of issues with wrestlers in gi. Look at a guy like agazarm whose clearly better in no gi. But still does quite admirably in gi. even in mma jacare uses wrestling you rarely see his judo. Judo just isn't as applicable imo. Wrestling /bjj/sambo are the best imo. With judo being in the next tier. Maybe some more judokas will come over and prove me wrong in mma and bjj. If guys like Chad mendes went into bjj he'd do really well. Believe that.

If you can wrap your  head aroud that a judoka can throw a guy in the ring with the same basics he does when he throws with a gi.  Hip-throws, sweeps, sacrifice-throws are all applicable without gi. There are a lot of examples of this in MMA. Ronda Rousey is being a good idea on how judo can be used  The grip-play in judo is fast and the grips have power. A judoka can easily change that to hits.

Lombard is top ten but rarely shows his judo.  against shields I saw it live and it was great.   The reason I keep it below is because it seems judoka out the organizing body doesn't like mma and discourages crossover.

It's true wrestlers give Judoka a hard time however the reason I say Judo is better for the Gi is because they mostly train in the Gi so when doing only grappling there use to it and I have seen wrestlers find the Gi to be an awkward thing because there are now new grips they never had to deal with but Wrestlers can still be hard to deal with and still could win. But take a wrestlers put him in shorts in (No-Gi or MMA) he should be fine there are no grips for someone to pull him. Judokas I have done no-Gi with have a hard time applying there Judo without the Gi but with time can learn how to change there grips and do fine,Wrestlers don't have to change much.

judo,2vtapt,Anthony126517,-4,Fri Feb 13 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"This is why MMA & BJJ are a overall better Sport & martial arts. They are the two fastest growing martial arts in the world, why you ask it's because they keep evolving and growing as a sport,martial arts & more.  Judo in today's day really sucks. Well it's a great throwing art it's not really a martial art anymore it's a poor sport with annoying banning of throws,submission & grips. It's lost it's way, Judo events suck to watch and are poorly run compaired to BJJ events. Go to a IBJJF,Naga or a local bjj event and there run really well. IJF have ruined Judo as martial arts/sport. The UFC could have done so much for Judo it brings in people,money and more. Judo as an art is great it should be on the same level as bjj but honestly it's not. Judo lost its way most judo newaza is poor,they don't ever do any self-defence,banning moves limiting its effectiveness and adding confusing rules every year to its sport (judoka/viewers watching get confused), Judo should get taken out of the Olympic like wrestling did maybe a scare like that would shake things up. I don't know who runs Judo these days but they need to step down. Judo is a great grappling martial art it's a shame what people did to it :("
judo,2vtapt,Kosoto_Gake,6,Sat Feb 14 03:31:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted. As much as I hate to admit it, you're right.   I love mma and bjj but if someone asks me what my sport is I'd say judo; that doesn't mean I'm going to blindly defend it though.   The changes have ruined judo and only a massive shock could change things or maybe we'll get sambo which could be nice."
judo,2vtapt,Anthony126517,2,Sat Feb 14 11:43:49 2015 UTC,"Lol it's because everybody has there own view on Judo and that's wonderful. As a BJJ crosstraining Judo I'm abit disappointed that the IJF has ruined Judo. I like Judo & have a ton of repected for all Judoka, finding all the throws amazing and to be honest BJJ & Judo carry over into each other. MMA & BJJ have been the 2 fastest growing sports in the world because they keep growing and changing. Judo should be right there with them. Don't get me wrong i really like Judo it's more then a sport and should be treated as such it's martial Art First and a sport second. Kano's Judo is not the same as it is in 2015. Judo is awesome."
judo,2vtapt,Anthony126517,3,Sat Feb 14 12:26:13 2015 UTC,In my opinion MMA and BJJ have grown so quickly because the Gracies and the UFC were great at marketing their product and in the early days especially because they were entering a market in the southern states of the US that was dominated by McDojo's and as such it was easy to appear legitimate and credible in comparison.
judo,2vtapt,Anthony126517,0,Sat Feb 14 13:02:34 2015 UTC,There many opinions on that. Yours is welcome however they proved there point and as for legitimate & credible I think the first 4 UFC prove that. Ken Shamrock & Dan were legitimate & credible at there time. Now if talk Judo it could use better marketing which in my opinion there very bad at. Can't blame UFC or Gracie's for good marketing & businesses to get there product out there to the public
judo,2vtapt,dave_attenburz,1 point,Sat Feb 14 14:28:12 2015 UTC,"My comment was not meant as a criticism at all, just an observation. I definitely agree that judo has a lot to learn when it comes to marketing itself.  I will maintain though that the earliest UFC events were full of fighters that were carefully chosen in order to make BJJ look as dominant as possible."
judo,2vtapt,Anthony126517,0,Sat Feb 14 14:53:10 2015 UTC,Lol I agree to that statement
judo,2vtapt,yknik,2,Sat Feb 14 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"the ijf hasn't 'ruined' judo. as someone with limited, probably recent, experience you'll have been exposed to a lot of internet griping about annoying rule changes. but fundamentally judo is still the same aggressive, physical, skillful and fucking difficult jacket wrestling it always was. ijf =/= judo for the vast vast majority of judo players in the world.   i'm as confident as i ever was that i could take the apocryphal high school wrestler in a gi and since i never practice no gi i probably couldn't have even when i was a decent morote gari and te guruma player. if morote gari and te guruma were the be all and end all of my judo it would have been a pretty sad situation.  to say that the ijf has ruined judo demonstrates you don't know what you're talking about."
judo,2vtapt,Anthony126517,0,Sat Feb 14 17:12:06 2015 UTC,Lol I have to disagree with that. My Family has been doing Sambo & Judo for a long time. Back when I was a kid watching my uncle he was always winning with leg grabs & fire men's Carey's and breaking grips with two hands now a days you can't do that it's a different game that has watered down Judo to the point were its not the same as it was years ago
judo,2vtapt,yknik,2,Sat Feb 14 19:41:34 2015 UTC,You state your opinion very strongly for someone with such a seemingly superficial knowledge of judo. Where did you gain so much confidence?

judo,2vp2l4,newhoza,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"Keeping the arm close is important for safety as well. If tori pulls uke's arm to his body AFTER tori's back is on the ground, he risks injuring it because he has less control over it. Falling backwards and then yanking the arm down fast is just asking to hyperextend the elbow before you have a stable grip established.   If my sensei saw someone drop to their back without taking the arm with them, he would stop them right there. The technique is already incorrect; there is no need to risk injury at that point."
judo,2vp2l4,TransientSilence,2,Fri Feb 13 10:27:09 2015 UTC,"From a BJJ guy, this is really important. When done right, your opponent should be tapping about halfway between sitting and laying back. If she isn't, your butt is more than likely too far from the shoulder."

judo,2vp3ge,SVPPB,6,Thu Feb 12 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"Judo's atemi waza are derived from the striking techniques of the Tenjin Shinyo Ryu, the first Koryu Bujutsu Kano studied.  The most basic form of judo's atemi can be found in the Seiryoku-Zenyo-Kokumin-Taiiku, postulated by Kano as an excercise for younger judoka in 1924:  http://judoinfo.com/seiryoku.htm  Unfortunately it's pretty basic only. The kata teaches essential motoric skills (in the solo exercise part), a little about deflecting blows and other attacks (in the partner exercise part), but it won't teach you how to apply strikes against a freely moving opponent.  The other self defense themed kata contain atemi as well, as others pointed out already.  Kata do not provide aliveness, only technical refinement, thus practicing these kata won't help you much learning how to actually apply them.   I know of a group of old school judo enthusiasts located in Germany, that practices judo atemi in bare knuckle full contact sparring. But I had no chance to really check them out yet. Their teaching lineage goes back to Tokio Hirano.  Other than that there seem to be very few dojos / instructors only who know anything about this matter let alone being able to teach/use them in an applicable way.  Thus practicing Muay Thai or another striking art for complementary purposes is a good idea.  So, how do the atemi waza look like? And how do they look like in application?  There's very, very little good footage of this.  Here's Tokio Hirano demonstrating a little bit:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ0brJb15Lw&feature=youtu.be&t=40m50s  Mifune's self defense (goshin jutsu) techniques contain atemi waza as well:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx23BoTIJ0s  Here's some postwar training footage from the Kodokan:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjsWPVve4Y  Textual sources:   ""Kodokan Judo"" by Jigoro Kano (aside from the kata very info like technique names and some striking points only) ""My Method Of Self-Defence"" by Mikonosuke Kawaishi (no terminology; supposedly the french original is a bit more elaborate) ""Modern Judo - part 2"" by Charles Yerkow (no japanese names though) http://www.ejmas.com/jcs/2004jcs/jcsart_Koizumi_0704.htm an article by Koizumi Gunji sydhoare.com/ATE-waza.pdf  (Be careful, I get a MALWARE warning from that site nowadays... )   How does it look like in alive sparring? Hard to tell. I've never seen that, but I assume it wouldn't look too different from karate kumite or combat sambo, except there are no kicks above belt level in judo.  Combat Sambo:  http://youtu.be/wK8XE5muif8?t=1h7m7s  Karate:  http://youtu.be/tKrfJuQjTP4?t=39s  Full contact Jiu Jitsu (this is no traditional Jiu Jitsu though):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX4KRLc1DQ4  EDIT: Remembered another source:  Here's a photo album of  (10th dan) Yoshitsugo Yamashiata's visit in the U.S. (he's called ""Yoshiaki"" instead of ""Yoshitsugo"" here), demonstrating judo, including some atemi waza:  http://scua.library.umass.edu/ead/muph006  Here's the Kimi Shiki, the middle third of the Seiryuko Zenyo Kokumin Taiiko demonstrated by the two 10 dans Samura and Nagaoka:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FqDhG9p4G4"

judo,2vp3ge,silvaphysh13,4,Mon Feb 16 07:57:18 2015 UTC,"The goshin-jutsu-no-kata has a number of atemi-waza in it. Generally, as I understand it, they were used not necessarily as a means to incapacitate in and of themselves, but rather as a method of achieving kuzushi. My sensei, for a time, also did weekly ""street judo"" classes, which had some gnarly strikes involved."
judo,2vp3ge,judokalinker,2,Thu Feb 12 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"As with nage no kata. The strikes that lead the uke to being thrown by ippon seoi nage, uki goshi, ura nage, and yoko guruma."
judo,2vp3ge,silvaphysh13,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:27:00 2015 UTC,"Sort of. In goshin, there are moves where, for example, you uppercut uke, then as they rock back from the punch, you throw them with a kote gaeshi."
judo,2vp3ge,judokalinker,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:27:17 2015 UTC,"I don't understand ""sort of"". The four throws I mentioned all stem from the other person throwing a strike"
judo,2vp3ge,silvaphysh13,1 point,Fri Feb 13 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"Right, but in goshin-jutsu tori does the striking against uke, not the other way around."
judo,2vp3ge,burritopete,2,Fri Feb 13 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"Ask your training partners at the MT/MMA place to spar. They're probably much more receptive to incorporating grappling into their standup than judoka are to incorporating striking into their judo. My judo school is pretty focused on competition judo, I think most guys would think its a waste of training time to do things that aren't judo, whereas an MMA guy will want to be exposed to judo-style takedowns."
judo,2vp3ge,Anthony126517,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:22:21 2015 UTC,Goshin-jutsu and kime-no-kata both have strikes.  Strikes exist in judo but it isn't a focus and since it isn't allowed in competition pretty much nobody does it.  The Kodokan Judo book only offers up two pages of information on it.
judo,2vp3ge,TransientSilence,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't that Japanese Jiu-Jitsu. You are better of with a other art to fill in the gap for striking. Maybe Boxing,Muay Thai,etc, It would be cool to learn Judo for self-defence on the street."
judo,2vnnp6,ItsJonesey94,5,Thu Feb 12 15:08:08 2015 UTC,Thirst thing for good kuzushi is not pulling or pushing: its taisabaki (body movement)  Second is maai (the correct distance for a throw)  Third is not thinking of kuzushi or a specific throw: thats the hardest part  .
judo,2vnnp6,fleischlaberl,2,Thu Feb 12 15:14:44 2015 UTC,Interesting - I think I understand what you mean but could you elaborate please?
judo,2vnnp6,silvaphysh13,9,Thu Feb 12 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"There's a word in Japanese that's good to ponder: mushin. Mushin refers to a state of placidity, and is the meant to be the ideal mindset during combat. The idea is that when you are completely relaxed, your body will react on it's own accord, rather than you concentrating on doing a particular task. In judo, this only can really be achieved after years of randori and uchi komi. I'm shodan, and I only really ""get there"" for a few minutes at a time. That being said, all my best throws had me asking what I did afterwards.   I also agree completely with fleischlaberl about taisabaki and maai. Remember, you create kuzushi by moving your hips and shoulders, not pulling with your hands. I like to demonstrate this by having someone take a very tight grip on me, any that they like, and letting go with my own hands. Then, I do a nice big circle step, letting my shoulders follow my hips, and watch them take a big lunging step to keep their grip.  This illustrates how important it is to use your position, rather than your grip, to create kuzushi."
judo,2vnnp6,silvaphysh13,1 point,Thu Feb 12 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I will try that exercise out, thank you! I understand what you are saying that kuzushi involves more than just the hands and wrists, but the movements of the hands on the gi ARE important to kuzushi aren't they? Or am I thinking about it completely the wrong way?"
judo,2vnnp6,silvaphysh13,2,Thu Feb 12 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"They can be useful in setting up the kuzushi, and in assisting with the kake. In some throws, the hands are more important than others. But it every throw, where your feet are placed is maybe the most important piece of positioning. I've found my best throws happen when my arms are pretty relaxed, actually."
judo,2vnnp6,fleischlaberl,2,Thu Feb 12 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"So I need to generally relax my arms, but also concern myself more with moving my whole body around in order to take them off balance? What I seem to end up doing a lot is being in the position for the throw, but finding myself trying to remove their entire body weight from the equation right at the end rather than taking out an already unbalanced target. It's particularly common with turning throws like tai-o-toshi, harai-goshi, uchi-mata etc. I end up trying to yank them into my throw with strength, which I know is a really bad habit and not good judo at all! Do you have any more exercises like the one you already suggested that I might try?"
judo,2vnnp6,fleischlaberl,3,Thu Feb 12 16:34:16 2015 UTC,"Tai-otoshi: All about timing, you need to practice your entry such that the foot you're attempting to block is just coming off the ground when you start to re-position. A common mistake is to turn, but it's not really accomplished that way. Instead, when you're in position (knee down, heel up) picture a hula-hoop resting on the back of your calf. Attempt to throw uke through that, versus trying to throw them to your front, where you'll be trying to pull them through your own body.  Harai-goshi: I would start by looking at uki-goshi. Think of it like a perpendicular o-goshi. I like to imagine a big hook coming out of your leading hip, that's trying to snag uke's belt knot. Don't forget to transfer your support foot in before lifting with the hip. The main difference, then, that makes it harai-goshi: swinging the leg back in an o-soto-gari like reap.   Uchi-mata: I really love the nage-no-kata setup for this throw. I'd recommend watching the video of it, and trying to go for the rotating ""load them up"" entry onto your back. Then it's basically an instance of making an o-soto-gari-like leg sweep back, while pulling continuously on their sleeve to keep the rotation going.   Apologies if this is a bit rambling, let me know if any of this makes sense."
judo,2vnnp6,aids_demonlord,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"Those do make sense, thanks a lot! I think a main problem I have is that I'm too concerned with the throws as a whole and am not considering the small individual and most basic parts enough, which leads to me rushing the technique and getting to stage 3 of a throw having not done stage 1 (kuzushi) properly."
judo,2vnnp6,Hippocampus88,6,Thu Feb 12 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"Kuzushi is not breaking ukes balance - it is unbalancing uke out of the support of his COG (center of gravity). Judo is a flowing and round motion and not zigzag. The movement comes from your center of gravity and your legs and the legs are rooted to the tatami with your feets.  Most people look at the wrong part of the body, when they watch judo. They are looking at the arms and on grip fighting (kumi kata). But the power of your body is about 70% in the legs and in your hips/lower back/abdomen and they are incredible strong IF you know how to move both in attacking and defending.  In randori/shiai the throw (nage waza) isn't exactly like the theory of kuzushi-tzukuri-kake: its one as a whole. Throwing is mostly toppling and twisting (seldom lifting like in all tsuri komi). This has to do with the COG: toppling over or twisting outside. If in your head is the textbook lifting of the sleeve to ""break"" the balance, you will get bad throws. Judo is ""good use of spirit and energy"" or ""maximum efficiency"" and this will lead to work with taisabaki, rooted to tthe tatami with your feeds and a free mind to see the moment (debana) and create or close the distance (maai and tsukuri).  Excellent example silvaphysh13!  ""Remember, you create kuzushi by moving your hips and shoulders, not pulling with your hands. I like to demonstrate this by having someone take a very tight grip on me, any that they like, and letting go with my own hands. Then, I do a nice big circle step, letting my shoulders follow my hips, and watch them take a big lunging step to keep their grip.

I definitely see what you mean, I definitely have been focussing on the grips too much as the source of kuzushi - what you say makes a lot of sense. Very excited to try this out in training tomorrow."
judo,2vnnp6,fleischlaberl,1 point,Thu Feb 12 20:54:17 2015 UTC,I would love to see a video demonstration of this.   I think I have learned more about kuzushi in this thread than many decades on the mat.
judo,2vnnp6,fleischlaberl,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"Last advice:  Don't forget decisiviness (isshin) and controll (zanshin).  Many Judoka I see, lack isshin (one heart). They try a little bit to throw and dont go ""all in"". If you have an opportunity (debana), you have to go with full speed and no fear. If you do the waza, controll the technique to the very end. Focus on what you are doing.  ."
judo,2vlp1c,judothrow777,29,Thu Feb 12 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"I don't consider myself to be particularly small at 140 and 5'5"", but I'm usually one of the smallest in the dojo (and female), so I'll weigh in.   Work at using technique, not strength. This is going to be hard if you've just started because you don't necessarily have a lot of technique yet, and it's easy to resort to muscling people around (I assume, although I've rarely had the luxury :P). This is where you ask your partner to help you. I suggest ""hey, I'm trying to work on technique, so let me know if I'm just muscling you around."" Randori is for learning, not for winning.  As far as the ""brutality"" of choking goes, your sexism is showing. It's not any nicer or meaner to choke a man than a woman. If they're uncomfortable, they'll tap. If their faces are getting red and they're not tapping, you're doing the choke wrong.  Personally, I love rolling with the big dudes because it's so darn satisfying to catch them with my sneaky tricks. If I'm injured or slow one day, I'll let my partner know- that's just sensible. I'm out there on the mat because I love judo- and while I'd rather be on the choker rather than the chokee side, I'm totally fine with the fact that it goes both ways."
judo,2vlp1c,rsv123,3,Thu Feb 12 01:58:50 2015 UTC,"By far the best answer. I'm also at a smaller club so all the belt levels train together. When you're at an advantage, use it as an opportunity to focus on your weak points.  As an example, today only two students showed up. Me and a brown belt. This guy is smaller than me, but much more experienced. If he had attacked me full on, he would have mopped the floor with me.  He didn't. When we did randori, he didn't block my throws. He made himself step out of them. It let me work on my setups, and still made the training productive for him."
judo,2vlp1c,dermanus,3,Thu Feb 12 05:20:25 2015 UTC,"^ What she wrote! Take the strength out of the randori, focus on the technique."
judo,2vlp1c,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Thu Feb 12 06:47:46 2015 UTC,"When I'm in that position, regardless of its due to weight, gender, experience, etc I do as others suggested focus on technique.  However I also put a greater emphasis into counter throws. I fight very defensively, and this is a great time to use their momentum against them."
judo,2vlp1c,microflops,0,Thu Feb 12 10:39:08 2015 UTC,"Excellent answer. However I just want to critique one thing that you said that I don't agree with. You called it sexist for him to think this way. I would just like to point out that it's a natural built-in instinct, from an evolutionary stand-point, that we men have developed, that tells us it is not 'ok' to brutally beat a woman. True, religion and certain societies can overcome this urge to protect women and there exists psychopaths, but most of us have this instinct to protect and not harm. You should be glad for this by the way, otherwise society would look very different.  So, back to the point. Is it sexist to think this way? No. If he thought you had nothing to do on the Judo mat, and rather stay home making sandwiches, or thought of you as inferior just because you're a woman, that would be sexist and wrong. Personally when I roll with women I usually don't hold back as much, unless I have a stupendous advantage, and they appreciate that, but there is always that part of me that says it is wrong to choke a woman. I don't bother thinking about it, I just notice that it is there. I rather think to myself; I am equipped with the correct morality standards from nature's side. Only overcoming them for sport :)"

judo,2vlp1c,stuckoverhere,4,Sat Feb 21 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"I have my judo Shodan. I started BJJ a couple of years ago. There was a purple belt female who was probably a good 15-20 kg's lighter than me. For the entire time I was at that club, 100% of the time she would tap me out, and I could not even get a stalemate.  There is plenty of room for improvement for you and your opponents both. Weight is not the only game changer. You should challenge them, even with your strength."
judo,2vlp1c,kenbu,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:37:05 2015 UTC,Agree. The best way to get over one's inhibition to choking your female teammates is to have one of them tap you over and over again (assuming one has access to some higher level players).
judo,2vlp1c,giuseppeSD,3,Thu Feb 12 18:04:34 2015 UTC,"I always feel out my partner during Randori. See what their strengths and weaknesses are, male or female. It doesn't matter if it's a guy or a girl if I'm incredibly stronger then my partner and I can repeatedly smash them then I'll switch focus to fine tuning my techniques. I might also ask my partner if they would like me to keep doing what I'm doing so they can practice gaining advantage.  tl; dr: Adjust accordingly for Randori, whether man or woman."
judo,2vlp1c,ArMcK,3,Thu Feb 12 02:03:45 2015 UTC,"Do you think you're doing them any favors by coddling them and giving them a false sense of confidence? They are taking judo so they can fight off bigger, stronger opponents."
judo,2vlp1c,giuseppeSD,2,Thu Feb 12 10:59:10 2015 UTC,I think this is a big-little conundrum or challenge (as opposed to a male-female one).
judo,2vlp1c,damasque,2,Thu Feb 12 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"focus on your technique, you'll dominate as you are physically bigger so put yourself into compromising positions to see if you can get out."
judo,2vlp1c,jonoy52,2,Thu Feb 12 03:39:24 2015 UTC,"Already mentioned, but seriously. Try and work on your technique and not on winning. You don't learn judo by doing half assed techniques with great strength. Think of what judos intent is ""maximum effect with minimum effort"". From what you describe, this is not what you are doing right now, which probably is because you are a white belt and not sure what you are supposed to do yet. And with the girl thing, drop that shit. Whenever you are doing newaza or randori you are doing it with other judoka, not some gender stereotype. If they are brown belts, then great! Take it as a possibility to learn technique since they will have better technique than you."
judo,2vlp1c,borrek,2,Thu Feb 12 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"As most people have said, think of it as an opportunity to work technique. Already mentioned is the trick of not using a grip or grabbing anything. If you learn that skill and restraint, it will pay off when you're up against guys your size and they want to get involved in a strength based tug of war. You'll be relaxed and know alternatives when they want to squeeze and pull and get tired.   As far as chokes go, I saw it mentioned that because of choking on domestic violence situations the player is uncomfortable applying chokes. Personally I think that is the opposite of how training should be. Keep in mind that randori is a chance for both people involved to learn. The reality is that the young lady you're rolling with is most likely to be attacked by a male much larger than her. If no one tries to choke her in class, how will she know to defend against it? The trick is to make sure you don't grind it out. Grab the lapel and pause there before going to the next step. She'll know what you're doing, and you'll know she knows, so it's a chance to academically learn those mid-course corrections. A perfectly applied choke should be immediately effective. If someone can hold out for more than 10 seconds against it then you're doing something wrong. Figure out what that is when you don't have to use strength and it'll serve you better when you do."
judo,2vlp1c,blackknightxiv,4,Thu Feb 12 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, I don't know why you're being taught chokes as a white belt.  It is your sensei's prerogative to teach them to whomever he/she wants, but chokes are pretty hard to do correctly and I generally wait until students have some rank before introducing them.   I would offer this advice, if you find yourself leaning too heavily on any technique, remove it from use for 6 months.  Just don't use it.  This will help you expand your repertoire and keep you from being a 3-trick horse when you're a brown belt.  Next, I'm 6'4"" and was fighting in the over 125kg division: not a small man.  Big guy to big guy: learn to take strength out of the equation.  Yes, we CAN physically pick up the 75kg girl and fling her to the mat using no skill, but that's not judo.  Same thing in newaza:  Are you bench-pressing tori off of you to escape the hold down, or are you using position?  It's HARD to unlearn to use your strength, but it will make your judo better, and will help you beyond telling when you go against people your size.  Insofar as fighting women:  They're in a martial art, they expect to be manhandled.  So long as you're using technique and not strength, it's ok.  Also, when you do randori, are you fighting to win or fighting to learn?  If you're trying to win at all costs, yeah, they probably think you're a jerk and a bully, but if you're playing judo with them as a learning experience, then they probably think you're a cool guy, even as you choke them out.  As a side note, if your uke is ""gasping for air"" when you choke them, you are doing it WRONG! Judo chokes are designed to cut off blood supply to the brain, not crush the windpipe.  If you find yourself consistently causing people to cough or gag, stop using that technique until you can get some more instruction from your sensei.  Long and short, if you feel choking the girls makes you a bully, stop using shime waza altogether.  If you feel like you're using too much raw power against the girls, you probably are.  Learn to use technique instead.  If you feel that your ego is getting in the way during randori, that's probably the case, too.  It's ok to lose.  It's ok to lose to a girl.  It's ok to lose to a girl that's smaller than you. (One of my first senseis was ~.66 my height and less than half my weight and she whipped the tar out of me consistantly.  I learned!)  Check your ego at the door, realize everyone is there to learn, and have fun!"
judo,2vlp1c,porl,7,Thu Feb 12 06:33:37 2015 UTC,Depending on where you are from it may be necessary - the Judo Federation of Australia requires one or two strangles as part of the yellow belt grading. I know at that level there is leeway within the club for requirements but it is definitely not uncommon to teach from the outset and can be done safely.

judo,2vlp1c,academicninja,3,Thu Feb 12 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I am misreading what you are saying. But experienced or large Judoka (ideally) should be playing to the level of their opponent.   Smashing white belts into the ground isn't helpful for them and despite what you say, it isn't being timid...randori is not a competition, its free form learning. Part of that learning is knowing what it feels like to execute correctly but if you're preventing that, its counter-productive for their learning.   And by going light you can learn new things too or restrict yourself to your bad side or poor throws. Learning for both."
judo,2vlp1c,rjgreen85,2,Thu Feb 12 09:49:59 2015 UTC,"i completely agree. re-read what i wrote and see how the first part didn't come off crystal clear:  randori isn't a contest. nobody's keeping score. stuffing every throw a white belt tries is going to frustrate them. jumping into every half-ass throw attempt you goad out of them is going to frustrate you.  i use randori against a less skilled opponent to work on stepping around or twisting out of throws. they don't have to know i'm timing everything they're doing, they can just think i'm BARELY getting around things every time.  i'm there for people to get better. i got where i am thanks to partners who were willing to throw my ass through the ground and extend a hand to help me back up. i figure i return the favor.   edit: the 'playing timid' line in my OP refers to them, not me. nobody should be scared to randori. i want smaller and less skilled partners to come at me with almost full abandon. i want them to be trying to toss me the best they can with whatever technique they can.  there's no pride in cleaning the mat with a lower rank."
judo,2vlp1c,academicninja,2,Thu Feb 12 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Yeah, I agree sometimes smaller people are far too timid when attacking bigger guys.   Perhaps they dont realize the upper belts/big guys are going to play to their level and let them learn.   I often find myself getting frustrated with some of the junior instructors because I see them going all balls against lower ranks. Nothing dangerous of course, but I see it as unhelpful to the beginners to get thrown again and again. To each their own, I suppose."

You can power through stuff, yeah, but it will catch up with you later in the form of crap technique. Also it sounds like you might need to tone it done a notch anyway...randori is a free form learning exercise not a death struggle.   If your chokes are causing the reactions you describe, you're likely doing them incorrectly (or are doing the slower less efficient ones). Ask for corrections.   If a Judoka, female or male, is uncomfortable with choking or another technique they will tell you.   I learn from people of all shapes, sizes, and ranks....even really small people. Everyone has something to offer.   Its good that you are aware of these issues and asking for suggestions."

judo,2vlp1c,internet_heyyo,1 point,Thu Feb 12 10:11:25 2015 UTC,"When working with smaller (assuming theyre not more skilled) training partners focus on using precise technique, the amount of strength you have to use is inversely proportional to how good your timing/technique is. You wont improve and will actually train in bad habits if you rely on strength so just remember its in your own interests. If their attacks are technically accurate and they are the same or lesser skill level its okay to give it to them a little but for the most part people need to learn for themselves what is their best plan of attack against big people. Personally if im against a huge person i find my only hope is typically getting on their back. Its a tricky balancing act but dont stress just remember yer all at training to improve your abilities and some times that means getting choked a whole lot."

judo,2vkotx,Hippocampus88,1 point,Thu Feb 12 11:06:39 2015 UTC,"First of all, you need a good uke. The throw is meant to use to momentum from a hit towards you, so a resisting uke will take away that momentum.  Here are my advices for tori:  Get low. Get slightly to ukes right side as you take the step forward. Place your right hand just above the belt on ukes belly, finger pointing upwards. Your left hand goes on the middle of toris back. As you start the throwing motion, thrust your hip forward, as if you want to lift a box that is taller than you."
judo,2vkotx,Hippocampus88,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:15:48 2015 UTC,"That is the way most people perform it, but that is not the correct way to do it.  Uke's punch to Tori's head should be made so that uke keeps his balance and is standing firmly.  Then Tori moves in, pulls uke towards him (kuzushi) ""sits"" down and just before he hits the floor he arches."
judo,2vkotx,silvaphysh13,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I get all that but it does not work for me.  What can uke do to be a better uke? Is uke supposed to be straight, slightly resisting, bending over or what?"
judo,2vkotx,silvaphysh13,1 point,Sun Feb 15 11:08:50 2015 UTC,"If you study the video you reposted yourself, you see many little hints for what to do as tori AND uke.  the hit needs to be executed like you wanna drive a knife straight downward into the skull. if you wanna put some force into that, you need your weight on your front foot and slightly(!) bent over.  this makes it easy for tori to tip him over into a breakfall.   This might be a thing to practice first: get close to uke and with the hands in the right positions, just sit down. this will pull uke forward and either he will tumble onto you, or do a breakfall over your shoulder after you released your grip(this needs to be cooperative). If this works smoothly, replace the sitting down motion with the proper motion. (thrusting your hip before you hit the ground so your first ground contact is with your shoulders and make the throwing movement with your arms)."

MRI showed full thickness tear of my acl and complex tear to my meniscus. luckily, it was 5 days before the deadline to sign up for obamacare so it would be active on 01/01/15. after all that, im scheduled for surgery in 9 days (02/24/2015).   im confident when it comes to making a full recovery. i had a friend who had a similar injury (except his meniscus was only torn but in anyway affecting his ROM and had a partial acl tear) made a full recovery and is doing well."

Confusion often arises when the attack starts standing and there is a transition to the ground where uke ends up tapping. It can be pretty hard to determine at what point the shime or katame waza was actually applied.
judo,2vidfp,staticfocus,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"There is no ""beating"" the bjj stance. If you are going to compete in a bjj tournament, you need to have a bjj gameplan. If you go into it with a judo mindset, you will get caught. Speaking from experience.   That being said, I hold rank in both arts and treat them both relatively separate. For bjj in particular, throw pins out the window as that will not win you a match. In modern bjj, right around 80% of matches end up with one person pulling guard. BUT, I have succeeded with Osoto Gari and Harai Goshi in bjj competition."
judo,2vidfp,Mountainous-Bear,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:52:50 2015 UTC,"How do you get to seting up the osoto and harai is basically what im asking, of course you shouldn't stick with pins in bjj. But what off balancing a gripping strategy should I be thinking about? (I do have a plan in mind)"
judo,2vidfp,TCamilo19,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"The stance is much lower in bjj, so it is easier to get an overhand grip. The first time I hit Osoto it was because I took that grip and he backed up and I attacked. The harai was from a similar setup, it just happened to be a harai to the side instead of Osoto.   I generally don't do many throws in bjj anymore unless they are heavily advancing on me. I usually drop down into De La Riva and work for a sweep to put me on top."
judo,2vidfp,Mountainous-Bear,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:45:30 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I'm 6,6 about 120kg and was wondering what throws I should be looking to use in competition as I will probably be the taller but may be the lighter guy. A lot of moves I've learnt so far don't seem to be hugely effective against big guys, especially with height difference, for example seoi nagi. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
judo,2vidfp,TCamilo19,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"The hardest thing for any openweight judoka looking to compete is getting enough time training with people in your weight category, so do anything you can to do more of this.  As to your question, osoto-gari is a classic big man's throw for a good reason. Yamashita has great videos on it.   Also, Inoue has a section of his DVD boxset devoted to the judo he used in the openweight category, a good place to start if you can get your hands on it."
judo,2vidfp,adamcino,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:29:34 2015 UTC,"Okay awesome, I've found myself automatically favouring osoto-gari in randori so its encouraging to know I may be doing the right thing. Could you specify which Inoue DVD it is as he seems to have a few different ones. Could you also let me know what the first throw is in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roM4lJk94x4 The taller judoka seems to favour it over his stocky opponent. Thanks again for all the advice."
judo,2vidfp,user079,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:33:19 2015 UTC,"It's an Uchi Mata, not a beautiful one though. A common choice among tall judoka. The length of their legs makes it easier to catch the opponent with this, while retaining their own balance. O Uchi Gari belongs into this category as well and is a good combo with Uchi Mata."

judo,2vdz8e,lostMartinet,4,Tue Feb 10 05:18:28 2015 UTC,The throw was awarded Waza-ari. Obviously at least one of the corner judges agreed. I'll leave it up to someone else to find out what the criteria was for waza-ari in 2010. https://judo.com.gr/world-championships-tokyo-2010-bronze-73kg-isaev-rus-wang-ki-chun-kor/
judo,2vdz8e,zaccbruce,1 point,Tue Feb 10 08:50:37 2015 UTC,In 2010 continuation of the throw was taken into account when scoring.  Back then it could have been considered waza-ari.

judo,2vdz8e,skytomorrownow,2,Tue Feb 10 22:38:04 2015 UTC,"No, there is no longer continuation. It was allowed for a while, but resulted in a lot of lower scores being 'alligator rolled' into ippon. Continuation was an idea put in place to deal with acrobatic defenders bridging out of ippon, etc. So, they allowed tori to continue to drive and 'finish it'. But as always, it got a little distorted, so they've removed it. It's sort of: a cat to kill a mouse; a dog to kill a cat; a bear to kill a dog; etc. endless chain reaction.   Personally, I don't think there really is a good rule set out there that will remove the human drive to exploit the rules, and thus, their attempts to legislate behavior will forever fail."

I don't know what it is, but at high levels, they love to score it for Ippon on even the sloppiest ones. Like you said, nothing about it has any considerable force, sometimes speed, and arguable control.  In contrast, I have used Sumi Gaeshi to roll an opponent over my head, and continue into a full mount pin. Because they rolled (which is how I think the throw should be done in the first place) I was only awarded waza-ari."

judo,2vdz8e,silvaphysh13,0,Tue Feb 10 20:10:57 2015 UTC,"This being called ippon is somewhat symptomatic of modern competitive judo. In their push to make judo more ""exciting"", I feel like some large governing bodies, like the IJF, have marginalized the spirit of the original rules. You may have guessed it, but I'm also not a fan of the shortening of osaekomi times either."
judo,2vdz8e,Hippocampus88,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"I have to say that I like the shortened osae-komi. If you can't get out of a hold in the first ~10-15 seconds, you will not get out, except tori can't maintain the strength the hold you. The longer the hold, the more it will be a competition of strength and not technique.  I would like more ne-waza time in general though."
judo,2vdz8e,Suey13,0,Tue Feb 10 22:33:16 2015 UTC,"Minus the fact that a head-dive could have potentially been called on white, it is no score.  Initial impact was on uke's front, yuko requires impact on the side, with the arm not tucked between the mat and the player.  No continuation is permitted."
judo,2vahyi,michachu,26,Mon Feb 9 11:39:24 2015 UTC,"Fellow BJJ-judoka here. Everyone else has given quality answers to your actual questions, so I'm going to address the differences between the teaching styles of your two gyms and why your BJJ gym probably doesn't suck.   Jiu-jitsu is a deep, deep game. There are hundreds of possible moves and thousands of combinations. If you're trying to finish an armbar from mount but the guy won't give it to you, you don't keep working on it. You try something else, nbd. Your playbook is deep, so if you keep flipping pages, you might find something to wreck him with. A high-level jiu-jitsu match is part arms race, part chess match - combatants try to predict each other's counters and force them into a position where they can employ their best techniques. Many jiujiteiros have made names for themselves winning tournaments with new techniques like the D'arce choke or the berimbolo; one has to keep up with these new attacks and maybe even create one's own.   Judo's toolbox is a lot shallower than jiu-jitsu's. Very seldom is a high-level match decided by one player's ignorance. A high-level match plays out like this: both fighters try to establish their preferred grip, then they try to manipulate each other's planes to set up their favorite technique(s). The opponent knows what is possible from any given position and will act accordingly, so the technique has to be perfect. If the throw doesn't work, you MIGHT have one or two follow-ups, and if those don't work, you're back to square one.   This is all to say that the metagame of the two arts have created a difference in training ethos between them. We have a lot more to learn (numbers-wise) in BJJ, so we adjust our pace to accommodate it. In my BJJ school, we typically learn one technique (say, the windmill sweep) and then go over a handful of follow-ups, because chances are that how we follow the sweep may be more important than the sweep itself. In judo, there's less to learn, but the margin separating victory and defeat often come down to the proper execution of one or two moves. So in my judo school, we do a little drilling of new techniques and tons of drilling for our favorite techniques.   Neither way is wrong; they're perfect for their goals."
judo,2vahyi,bear-knuckle,6,Mon Feb 9 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"This is a really great observation. I'd had vague notions similar to this floating around in my head, but you've crystallized them in a very satisfying way."
judo,2vahyi,Sirkkus,3,Mon Feb 9 18:14:39 2015 UTC,This is the best comment I have ever read in this sub.  Good job.
judo,2vahyi,DysonMachine,4,Mon Feb 9 20:30:53 2015 UTC,Fellow cross trainer here.  At first I was going to disagree with your statement but the further I read and thought about it I realised you were exactly right.  Great post.
judo,2vahyi,porl,2,Mon Feb 9 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"Great post, thanks very much.  I just wanted to mention that if you think about boxing, it's perhaps even further on the 'shallow toolbox' end of things than judo. In boxing you've got the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Nothing else, really, but the difference between a Manny Pacquaio and a random amateur is the massive depth of knowledge and skill and timing and footwork it takes to land all these blows with skill and force while not getting hit. You could spend a lifetime working on that."
judo,2vahyi,ManicParroT,3,Tue Feb 10 13:39:36 2015 UTC,"I box as well, and I completely agree. You've got six punches in boxing, roughly seven targets and only so many ways to avoid whatever strike. Floyd Mayweather wins practically every round of every fight - not because he knows more techniques than the competition but because he's honed every one to a razor's edge.  The shallower the toolbox, the narrower the margin for victory. A quarter-second more of reaction time can be enough to elevate a top fighter miles above his peers."
judo,2vahyi,bear-knuckle,4,Tue Feb 10 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"Floyd Mayweather wins practically every round of every fight - not because he knows more techniques than the competition but because he's honed every one to a razor's edge.   I think you're mistaken. Mastery of boxing is not about mastery of any one individual technique, or even about mastery of every individual technique.  Boxing is not orthodox stance, soutpaw stance, jab, cross, hook, uppercut, step forward, step backward, step left, step right, slip left, slip right, duck, rock-back, weave left, weave right, and clinch. All these things are of boxing, and in boxing, but they aren't the meat of the thing.   Even if you were to catalog all of the variations of all of the above in exhaustive detail- southpaw jab to the head, southpaw jab to the body, orthodox jab to the head, orthodox jab to the body, etcetera etcetera ad infinitum- you still won't have scratched the surface of what boxing actually is.  Boxing is the relationship between all of its constituent parts. It's the way the jab sets up the cross, the way the cross sets up the hook. It's an intimate grasp of the timing between the jab and the cross, the cross and the hook. It's a jab going well with a step forward, and a right uppercut going badly with it. It's a cross to the body taking the wind out of an opponent, making their hands dip lower- where they can't respond as effectively to a follow-up to the head. It's the change of the angle that the jab and cross must take to hit an opponent in southpaw stance rather than in orthodox. It's catching an opponent with a left hook when they're in the middle of stepping to their right. It's facing a man with a mean left hook and never stepping to the right.  You can study the dictionary for ten thousand years, learn every minute detail about the words therein, develop elaborate and brilliant taxonomies for them. And at the end of it all, you still won't be an eloquent public speaker.  You can painstakingly handcraft pistons, valves, crankshafts and spark plugs- make them masterpieces, file them and polish them and oil them and repair their every fault. And you will never end up with a running motor.  It's about the system- not the system's components. The same is true for all martial arts."

The depth of the meta game as you call it offers an explanation as to why defeating a ""bigger and stronger opponent"" can happen more easily in BJJ.  That said, there are dimensions to BJJ that are not trained very extensively and stand-up is something judo and wrestling are just better at. It's also easy to underestimate the value of speed, timing and sheer tenacity when you're used to technique winning out.  Thank you for typing this up.

Relax and let yourself be thrown, fighting the throw will only make it hurt more. Never reach for the ground, its there I promise you. A good Sensei will make all the difference. A Sensei can make the difference between plateauing 6 months in to continuing to learn way into your Dan grades.  Most schools do a bit of randori (free practice) alongside their regular training session. Its important to have a bit of free practice alongside more technical classes in order to grow as a judoka, but beware of schools that only do randori. Look for a school that has people roughly your size, its no fun to practice with people who are massively different size to you. You may learn a lot from a club that has a lot of black belts, especially if they are patient and willing to give you tips. But its also fun to do it alongside people your level also growing at your speed. You already have a good amount of BJJ experience, so your 6 months will go smoothly. They are related martial arts so you will excel in Ne Waza (groundwork), but don't act cocky, always be willing to accept tips and approach it with an open mind."

I'll try to keep an open mind as much as possible (though honestly, that hasn't been hard as the instruction I saw was top notch).  So far the biggest surprise was this: a friend warned me that falling was the first thing I'd learn. I didn't realize I'd spend so much time learning it. I think I spent an extra 10 minutes practicing breakfalls in that introductory class because it was my first lesson, and I'm expecting more of that in the months ahead."

You might have learned breakfalls in BJJ, but in judo, they're a necessity.  Train them until they become natural.  You should look for a sensei who is both attentive to detail and willing to make his students work hard.  You should leave every class sweaty and exhausted, but still feeling like you're learning something. My main club has open mats, but they're more nonstop randori sessions, than problem area focusing drilling sessions. You do want a good mix. You will learn more from drilling and sparring with dans, but you won't be able to actually throw any of them in randori without trying shit on fellow noobs. In 6 months, you will have learned how to take falls without knocking yourself out and give a passable approximation of a few throws.  From the moment you learn a throw, it usually takes MONTHS of training just to get them reasonably down.  It's one thing to be able to throw a compliant partner, but another thing entirely when they're fighting you."

This is gonna be a hard first 6 months."
judo,2vahyi,ReddJudicata,3,Wed Feb 11 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"It's definitely common in my experience that judo clubs don't have open mat time. Not sure why exactly this is, or if it's different in certain countries (I'm pretty sure I've heard that the Kodokan has an equivalent of open mat time, but it may be special). However, a good judo class should have lots of time for randori (free practice, the equivalent of ""rolling"" in BJJ). In my opinion, if a judo class didn't spend around a third of the total class time on randori I wouldn't be very interested in it (of course, there may be specialized recreational classes in certain clubs where people are looking for a less randori-focused experience).  For picking schools, I would look for a handful of people around your weight at slightly higher rank than yours (one or two belts ranks). Obviously, the higher ranked judoka will help you a lot, but I think that practicing with people a bit closer to you, but still of higher skill level, can be more rewarding since you might occasionally be able to throw them without them letting you.  One thing to keep in mind about judo is that you won't get the most out of your cross-training by focusing on trying to learn how to perform the throws properly. It's relatively easy to learn the principles of a throw and demonstrate them on a cooperating opponent. What BJJ practitioners usually lack (in my experience), is knowing how to move around, keep balance, good posture, know how to break posture, and timing of attacks. These are things that are difficult to teach and best learned by lots of practice, so progress may be slow at first."
judo,2vahyi,cheeri0so,3,Mon Feb 9 16:10:37 2015 UTC,"In my experience judo clubs don't have open mat time because they don't have their own dedicated mat space. That and the coaches are volunteers so have limited time to supervise practice, which might be required for the club's insurance."
judo,2vahyi,OceanRacoon,2,Mon Feb 9 19:12:06 2015 UTC,"That sounds reasonable, although I've trained at clubs that do have dedicated mat space, even owning the building. I think the later sounds right though, since most judo clubs are not run for profit and rely heavily on volunteers."

judo,2vahyi,ckristiantyler,2,Wed Feb 11 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"Really concentrate on the unbalancing aspect of judo, it's the start of moat successful throws and something you often forget when you start.  Footsweeps and well timed pulls/pushes and leading your opponent around the mat are all important for unbalancing the other guy and getting your hips underneath them or tripping them.  Also don't push too hard into your opponent or he'll throw you"

In BJJ we learn how to do the throws, and the basic concepts around push/pull misdirection, but it's way deeper than can be put into words or drilled in a couple of lessons. Sensing where an opponent's weight is never came naturally for me in BJJ, so I'll have to work a bit on this aspect along with timing (etc).  Thank you for the thoughts. I honestly can't wait til the day I'm able to perform a simple footsweep on a resisting opponent (Judo or BJJ)."

Try to stretch your whole body after a workout.   Deadlifts and weighted pull ups may be the best starting workouts for developing power in your core, hips and tightening your grip."

When it comes to compound work I like to do these movements in terms of strength: Deadlift, heavy Pull ups, Front Squats, Overhead press, heavy Dips.  Compound movements between 8-10 reps: Pushups, rows, pullups, single leg squats.  Lots of cardio and yoga aswell."
judo,2v6fjd,blitzrain,0,Sun Feb 8 17:28:00 2015 UTC,"Kettlebell Sport. It's basically endurance Weightlifting. Instead of focusing on 1RM strength in the clean&jerk and snatch it's all about multiple reps with a submaximal weight within a (usually)10min set. It builds strength and endurance at the same time with quick, ballistic movements.  Here is a great place to get started on technique and the vfworkout channel on youtube is a great resource as well."
judo,2v3kj7,TCamilo19,11,Sat Feb 7 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"Link and copy/paste for lazy:  The USJA Board of Directors would like to advise our members of actions that have taken place last week. Following the resignation of one our office staff it became apparent there was a huge backlog in processing registrations, promotions, sanctions, etc. To this end the BoD decided to do a site visit and evaluate the status of the office as well as lend a hand catching things up.  Upon arrival it became obvious that the Office Manager was going to resist any help offered regardless of the overwhelming backlog. By refusing to cooperate even to open access to the USJA property for the BoD had little choice but to terminate him for insubordination. Because it was impossible to discuss these serious issues with Executive Director who had refused to return from vacation without a five year employment contract, she was also terminated.  Several members of the BoD remained at the National Office in Florida the rest of the week including the President, a computer expert, as well as numerous volunteers that immediately stepped in to help learning and supporting the smooth running of the office. While often changes are regrettable, the planned recovery resulted in catching the office up on its two month backlog.  Be assured your BoD are dedicated to all USJA clubs and members. Any changes that might be under consideration will be well thought out and will only be implemented in the best interest of the Association. We advise everyone that the USJA remains strong and dedicated to judo and our membership. There should be little in the way of any major negative impact.  If you need more information rather than listening to rumors and gossip, please call any member of the BoD (http://www.usja-judo.org/board-of-directors/ ) who are here to serve your best interest.  Respectfully and officially submitted, USJA Board of Directors February 7, 2015, thanks."

For the record I think this is a step in the right direction, and I seriously appreciate that they announced it, but the US has three ""governing"" bodies for Judo, and it ain't for the benefit of the players, I'll tell you that much.  I say this as both a lifetime member of the USJA, and as a close friend to several people high up in the organization.  EDIT: Apparently the office manager who was fired gave herself a 1,500 a month raise, on top of 15,000 dollars disappearing from the USJA coffers. Then she hired a bunch of her friends and went on a 3 week vacation sick leave. Money well spent!"

judo,2v3kj7,burritopete,2,Sat Feb 7 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"The reason there are three governing bodies is because the leaders are all friends with each other and want to keep their jobs. It's nothing more than ""you rub my back and I'll rub yours."" That's why the USJA has been pushing this ""grassroots"" Judo more and more, to differentiate and justify its existence when compared to USA Judo."

As for ""governing"" bodies, only a very select high level players care about that. With judo membership dropping in ALL judo associations, it's sad to see this. It's also surprising that almost no one is talking about this."

It might be different if they each had something to offer, but as I see it, they should merge, what is left of the user can focus on grass roots as it has been. Usja can focus on military relations, and let usji keep its elite focus. The trick is reorganizing in a way that we don't loose those people who are productive and help move judo forward in the US in the process. But reducing the redundancy would be vital, and of course a possible need to keep people honest with better checks and balances with finances."
judo,2v4h7l,Hippocampus88,3,Sat Feb 7 20:42:41 2015 UTC,Lapel choke with the help pf a leg grip. I think it's considered as a okuri eri jime variant. Neil Ohlenkamp describes something very similar in his book as a counter to ippon seoi nage. Other than that it's not too rare in BJJ.
judo,2v4h7l,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Sat Feb 7 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, the BJJers call it a bow and arrow choke. I've seen it named as jigoku-jime by Komuro."
judo,2v4h7l,jonahewell,2,Sun Feb 8 07:57:51 2015 UTC,"Looks like a variation of what's known as the bow-and-arrow choke in BJJ, except it's usually completed on the ground when you have someone's back. Pretty fast application of the choke."

judo,2v4h7l,psychicus,2,Sun Feb 8 08:39:25 2015 UTC,I got the feeling that it's 'in dubio pro tori'. Preferencing the more active competitor and punishing the attempt to 'flee' into ne-waza or tachi-waza from a technique.

judo,2uzrp8,silvaphysh13,5,Fri Feb 6 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"Woah... good luck finding someone... that's a rare kata. From what I learned Kano considered it a work in progress. He wasn't happy with it the way it is, but never got around to fix it. He said something along the lines of:""You can practice it if you want, but you don't have to.""  Here's a video of  Toshiyasu Ochiai 8th dan performing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBUPcWYdck  As far as I know he's considered to be one of the few judoka who know the kata well.  EDIT / I found a little more info:  The user ""Jonesy"" posted this in the old http://JudoForum.com   Jigoro Kano wrote this in the November 1921 issue of the journal Yuko-no-katsudo on the progression of learning kata: “Go-no-kata or at times called Go-Ju-no-kata, I remember having taught it some time in the past but my study was not complete; three or four out of the total ten forms in it, I did not like. I had thought of reviewing it but left it as it was. In this kata, at first both [tori and uke] will push, pull or twist each other hard and in the end one [tori] will win by surrendering himself to the force. I am thinking of completing it in future and teach it in the Kodokan. As for now, you may study it or not study it, which is up to you.”"

Judo needs some big change, Judo events don't really draw people in as BJJ and MMA do because there not execting. The rules need to change as well every year there different banning moves (throws,grips,submissions) this can be confusing for people watching and the Judoka taking part. As a Martial Art Judo needs to change the tradnational way should be more modern abit and go back to Kano's view (sport & self-defense) maybe a little bit of both would be the perfect mix. Before anybody gets annoyed by what I said this is my view. :) the UFC doing this Judo could be good. MMA/BJJ have been tied at the hip from day,Judo could use some of that!"

judo,2ux4uc,Hippocampus88,2,Fri Feb 6 03:25:34 2015 UTC,because it's more strangling than choking. this makes it more dangerous than traditional chokes with hands or collar. The same reason why you are not allowed to use the belt for choking.
judo,2ux4uc,Kosoto_Gake,3,Sat Feb 7 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't know it was banned, but if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say it's probably because it cranks the neck a little.   What is DZR?"

judo,2ux4uc,dave_attenburz,3,Thu Feb 5 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"Danzan Ryu Jujutsu.  It has some historical lineage that ties it to the Kodokan, in that the founder trained in it and had a black belt in it, and the founder, Okazaki, was asked to join DZR under the umbrella of the Kodokan, but he declined.  It has a greater emphasis on groundwork than Judo, and some of the techniques that are in both arts are slightly differently named.  The biggest thing in DZR is that there are two schools of thought on training.  There are dojos that literally do nothing buy kata.  Just kata.  No randori.  Then there are others (like mine) where randori is heavily emphasized.  What this means is that you can get two VERY different stories about DZR training, depending on where they trained."

Its a safety thing.   The gerbi choke was always illegal but the ref who let her score with it didn't recognise it was a skirt choke. It happened again and the rules were clarified.   In the fight vs the ijf try not to cry wolf or legitimate complaints will be drowned in the noise."

judo,2ux4uc,dave_attenburz,2,Fri Feb 6 19:23:39 2015 UTC,"Of course some techniques are banned because they pose undue risk of injury, and of course hurting your training partners is a bad idea, and of course undue risk of injury is a legitimate reason to ban a technique.

The sensei and some of the black belts are also Judo Black Belts and compete.  At some point, I became good at chokes like this one, and we still teach it in training.  Last night, I tapped another brown belt with it, and one of the black belts mentioned that it was now banned in Judo.  HE referred to it as the Girby Choke.  Looking it up brought me this video.  Is there a reason that it's banned?  Since DZR people regularly compete in Judo comps, the discussion of banned techniques (e.g touching the legs) comes up in class."

judo,2ux4uc,TroxX,2,Fri Feb 6 20:07:01 2015 UTC,It was banned because it was already borderline illegal according to IJF rules at the time.  This particular choke was a gray area and the referee made the right call. No one wants to see a gold medal match at Worlds be decided by a referee.

judo,2uv0a2,burritopete,12,Thu Feb 5 11:03:25 2015 UTC,"Hello, competitive kata player here.  Been playing approximately six years, ikkyu.  We complete in four katas right now; katame, kime, goshin, ju no.  We also do itsutsu, nage, and koshiki but have not competed in them.  To me kata focuses on technique.  In our regular practices I find me correcting other players on kuzushi and body placement regularly.  It also allows me to practice some of the old techniques that have been banned.  From a competitive aspect, the reason my partner and I like doing kata is that we're competing against ourselves.  We know when a particular kata has gone well or not so well."
judo,2uv0a2,silvaphysh13,4,Thu Feb 5 11:37:24 2015 UTC,"Kata is an excellent tool for learning proper kuzushi, tai-sabaki etc and don't forget the role of uke.   If the attack is wrong, the timing is off or if uke's ukemi is bad, everything looks bad.  Kata is a good self regulating tool for finding errors."

To me, kata has been absolutely invaluable in improving my technique. I believe the people who dismiss kata often lack the patience to understand it's value. I try to think of it as a very long, elaborate throwing/matwork drill. Once you've practiced the stepping and bowing, etc. long enough, you being to realize that it's an awesome way to carefully examine the mechanics that make each -type- of throw work. Ask any of the great Japanese players, Yamashita, Inoue, and they all mention going back to kata from time to time to regain focus. It is, in my opinion, one of the more challenging things you can attempt in judo."

Those who claim that kata are useless do not understand what they are for.  From here I'll just quote myself from an older post:  Kata are not a show, a dance or an end in itself. And particularly they were not intended to be a dan exam harassment.  Kata (the word works both in singular as in plural) are a preset form of exercises. They are nothing more and nothing less than a basic teaching and learning tool aimed at beginners. When we use the word kata discussing Judo, we often specifically refer to classical kata like the Nage no Kata, Katame no Kata, Kime no Kata etc. The word kata itself could refer to any preset exercise though. Even one a coach just made up, because he thinks his students will benefit from doing it.  Thus: One doesn't practice to do kata. One does kata to practice.  Now to the question: What value do the classical Judo kata have?  It depends imho. As any didactic tool its usefulness depends on the judoka it is aimed at and also how it is used (imho there isn't ""just one correct way"" to do a kata).  If some students have yet to learn how to do a basic harai goshi for example, the Nage no Kata provides a fool proof pattern. If you have advanced judoka, who can do harai goshi from all sorts of situations, they won't benefit anymore from this part of the kata.  Thus I have come to the following conclusions regarding the use of kata:   Kata are essential to learn judo (the classical ones, as well as others) classical kata should be taught to beginners (yep, starting at white belt), preferably in the order given by Kano (Ju no Kata, Nage no Kata, Katame no Kata ...) Kata don't have to be done and taught as a whole. You can pick parts from them as you like! One shouldn't overstate the look of a kata. Imho it doesn't matter how many steps uke and tori do. The correct distance for attack and defense matter. The first law of design is: ""The form follows the function"". This applys to kata as well (kata actually means ""form""). Kata may be modified. I think it's totally okay to depart from the basic form once you've mastered it. Let uke vary his attacks, react appropreately. You'll learn a lot more.   Do the classical kata teach the optimal way of doing judo?  Honestly? I doubt it. Forms are by their nature static. But judo -as the translation indicates- is the universal principle of flexibility. Thus kata cannot define the end of development. They don't even define the middle of it. They provide a starting point. That's why judo should start with kata and not end with it.  Think about this analogy:  Imagine Kano had invented maths and not judo. Now think he had written a book of basic exercises teaching you how to add and multiply. Of course there are many ways to learn math. There are even many ways to add and multiply, some even more efficient than others. Now think his followers would use the same exercises from the book over and over again to teach beginners. Okay, nothing wrong so far, but now imagine there were followers who are already experienced at higher maths and now go back to the basics and practice them. And not only that, they try to write every calculation down exactly in the same manner to the dot and line. Sounds weird, does it? Now imagine multiple mathematicians writing a simple multiplication table on a board in front of an audience and a jury deciding who wrote it down best. It's getting downright stupid, does it?   I hope this illustrates what kata are and what they are useful for.  Bonus: Here is a video of two yellow belts doing the ju no kata: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mygd8Eoisk Now this doesn't look as polished as other versions out there, but hey... it doesn't have to. If these two judoka improved their coordinative abilities while doing it over and over, it was useful to them."

I disagree with this.  Judo is much more complicated than simple maths and, just like shiai, you can learn a great deal by competing.  Not only by studying what other players do for each movement, but often judges will take time after a tournament to give their opinions on what was right and what was wrong.  I agree that kata should be modified.  Even a change of partner can make a huge difference.  I occasionally get to practice ju-no-kata with a player slightly taller and heavier than me, with two titanium hips, and it makes a huge difference from my usual partner that is much smaller and lighter than me.  Love the video. :)"
judo,2uv0a2,TsurugiTakuma,2,Fri Feb 6 12:50:14 2015 UTC,Good post. Thank you. I like this article from Donn F. Draeger about Kata: http://judoinfo.com/kata.htm  The right understanding about what kata is supposed to be never reached the west.
judo,2uv0a2,dermanus,1 point,Fri Feb 6 19:44:54 2015 UTC,"Indeed.   I'm sure this is a terrible first post to be making, but the anti-kata crowd strike me as tragically ignorant. Draeger, an exceptional martial artist by any measure, answered the very arguments against it that people make today decades ago. Was this because he was afraid of randori? Of course not, but that's what I hear said of an interest in kata.  (The caveat of course being that many of us in the west never even got the chance to learn it properly, considering the amount of judoka who picture TKD dancing when they hear the word kata and don't even realize that Japanese kata are different.)  I sound bitter, I know, but as someone studying judo in the west it's sad that so much of the fundamentals seem cut off because we've passed through a few generations of people who barely tolerated them. There's a wealth of judo to be learned even within the ever-shrinking parameters of the IJF but I don't know why the walls need to close in because the low-rent EU bureaucrats that are the IJF have no interest in Kano."
judo,2uv0a2,fleischlaberl,5,Sun Feb 22 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"I do kata pretty regularly because it's one of two classes I can make it to in a week. I also find it helps me pick up the techniques faster since I'm used to learning kata from my karate background.  We do mostly nage no kata, with a bit of the others thrown in for variety.   At minimum having 15 off-hand throws is useful. I also appreciate the time as uke since it helps to understand the mechanics of the throw better."
judo,2uv0a2,fleischlaberl,3,Thu Feb 5 13:12:49 2015 UTC,There are three ways (do) and methods (do) to practice Judo:  Kata (form)  Randori (free gripping)  Shiai (test together)

judo,2uv0a2,Aratoast,5,Sat Feb 7 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think most people should know kata. It was a requirement for shodan for many years and i hate that some schools are straying away from it now-a-day. id say learn the nage no kata and see how you like it.  the fun thing with kata, if youre strictly a judo fighter, is that there are strike defenses, so i like to show students that judo does indeed have striking.   you cant be hurt by more knowledge about the martial art."

When it came to learning them as an adult, I still had that mind frame, and I think that prevented me from opening up to realise the tradition to the art.

If I had the option, I would say remove it from the syllabus and make it its own art. Like competition is. Or atleast give the competitive fighters a different grading system"
judo,2uv0a2,Kosoto_Gake,10,Thu Feb 5 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"Requiring kata was/is a good way of passing on and preserving technique. Obviously in competitions there are variations, but kata keeps the 'basic' mechanics of the named throw the same, ensuring continuity and preventing less common techniques from being lost.  I guess views on this differ between those who consider Judo as a sport and those who still practice it more traditionally as a martial art."
judo,2uv0a2,Aratoast,2,Thu Feb 5 15:45:14 2015 UTC,"Been doing Judo for about 15 months, am at yellow belt, and have done one session on the first set of the Nage No Kata and a few sessions on the Katame No Kata. Also been to a couple of ""Judo for self defense"" sessions which included a couple of techniques from the Kodokan Goshin Jutsu.  I'm under no illusions that Kata are at all easy, but I do regret not getting to practice them more regularly (they're only a requirement for...I believe 1st Dan in the syllabus of any of the UK governing bodies so they don't tend to get taught regularly from the get-go) as I see them as being of great value to learning from the get-go, and it's a shame we seem to have forgotten the reason Kano put such emphasis on them."
judo,2uv0a2,Kosoto_Gake,5,Thu Feb 5 11:34:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent work.  Please don't regard kata as a future requirement for a Dan graduation, see it as a learning tool.

Besides simply having to learn a bunch of completely unfamiliar movements, etc., the biggest challenge for me is that judo is a lot more physically demanding than anything I've done before.  In terms of both cardio fitness and regular physical strength I'm far below the average for the dojo, and by the end of class I am completely drained and exhausted, I'm gasping for breath and my legs are so weak I can barely stand.

There will be some friction with clubs wanting to train within the constraints of judo rules that aren't applicable to mma (only gi training, no leg grabs, etc) and the needs of an mma fighter. Either the mma guy will have to suck it up and train for judo competition or he will have to find individuals willing to train more freestyle within a club or he will have to find a club that trains hard but not for the official ruleset.

I do judo now but my coach only teaches the technique none of the other stuff but we use the names.  He wrestled like me so he teaches it like that which I like.   But I do not care for the formality or katas I think they are pointless. And that's just me but I get why people do them but I can't see why anyone wouldn't respect practicality.
judo,2uqwqg,SVPPB,6,Wed Feb 4 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you, a judoka who doesn't appreciate your practical attitude did."
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,2,Wed Feb 4 16:20:57 2015 UTC,I dont downvote anyone in here unless theyre one of those crazy people who supports the recent ruining of the sport. cheers.   Screw that Judoka Il double leg them. I still don't know what Kano is. I know what Kata is since I did karate for many years. I got a lot out of karate but mostly it was speed and distance measuring. I didn't become a better person because of Katas. I became a better person through hard work and dedication.
judo,2uqwqg,academicninja,7,Wed Feb 4 17:35:46 2015 UTC,"Honest question: have you tried learning the randori no kata (Especially the nage no kata)?  I used to be against katas until I started studying them.   The nage no kata requires you to learn fifteen throws from both left and right stance.   Moreover, it makes you practice specific ways in which to apply these throws (some you have to do against opponents rushing you, others are done while walking, others require you to spin your opponent around, etc)  And finally, the clockwork timing required to perform the kata makes you develop a sense of precision and puts you under a certain mental pressure that isn't usually included in drills.  I think the nage no kata makes you a better judoka, and the overwhelming majority of judo governing bodies agree with me, since it's a very common requirement for grading as an ikkyu or shodan worldwide."
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,5,Wed Feb 4 21:53:45 2015 UTC,"Kano was the founder of judo. You should do a bit of reading on Wikipedia or the like. He's the guy in the picture at the bottom of this website. One of his significant insights about martial arts was that safe sparring is essential for effective technique and competition is a great way to create seriousness and motivation in training. He had some grand visions about judo's potential role and impact on larger society that will be less appreciated by the more practical minded. All the same, part of ""doing judo"" vs ""learning throws"" is having knowledge of its history."
judo,2uqwqg,Carlos13th,0,Wed Feb 4 17:50:10 2015 UTC,I know who Kano is I thought this was a term like Kata. It was not referred as if he was a person I thought it was a name sake. I can appreciate it and think a lot of the formality is stupid. You can respect the ideals of the founders and still think katas are dumb.
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"How long have you been practicing?   Because I think you need to do more before you give up on the usefulness of kata. The formality is about respect- respect for the teachers/art, respect for your partners, and respect for yourself. The discipline is also engrained in this formality.   Many of the tenets of Judo go beyond the mat. Its a lifestyle as well as an art. But you will not grasp this if you have a closed mind."
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,1 point,Thu Feb 5 07:58:57 2015 UTC,A couple years on and off. I respect it mate. Everyone in here is upset. I come from wrestling. Its different and I prefer that ideology. When I go to Judo I want the technique and thats it. I have immense respect for my partners wrestling taught me that I just show it different and have a different ideology I guess? I dont see anything wrong with just wanting the technique it shouldn't be an all or nothing issue.   People don't like that around here. Il keep practicing my coach prefers that with me so we can be the weirdos.   edit: Im not just some random first year grappler or something. I have grappled for almost a decade and competed in wrestling for a good bit in college. I just don't enjoy formality. They exist in wrestling to a llesser extent but respect is at a all time high.
judo,2uqwqg,SVPPB,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:10:15 2015 UTC,Kano is the founder of judo. Pretty cool dude. Took jiu jitsu got rid of the stuff that was apparently to deadly to spar and then got everyone to spar/randori all the damn time to make sure they could actually use what they were learning.
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,0,Thu Feb 5 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"If you don't do kata, you know nothing of judo.  You think kata is easy?  Compare this crap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOvi_qjVnZM  To this excellence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5bKW06LkkY"
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,2,Thu Feb 5 10:28:21 2015 UTC,If you read most of this thread we had a misunderstanding of what katas are and it seems most people here disagree. I thought it was more subpar to karate katas where you basically do choreography with fake opponent's. Then someone else said just drilling.  I don't know what the truth is though.  It's not really clear.   If it's just drilling I do that if it's the other than that's your opinion
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,-1,Thu Feb 5 10:34:04 2015 UTC,"My opinion? Really? You must be young and/or ignorant.  Don't worry. You will never reach any significant level of judo knowledge anyway.  Give kata a try and tell me how ""easy"" it is."
judo,2uqwqg,KarateCowboy,-1,Thu Feb 5 10:38:55 2015 UTC,Did you read what I said or just get defensive?  I clearly stated there's a confusion of what the hell kata is. I have very transparently stated on here I was mistaken or at the very least not clear on katas. This was very explicit and ignorant of it not to recognize.   I am trying to figure it out and by the way I haven't called it easy I just said what in my mind was a kata was something I wanted no part in. Whatever it is I wish someone throughly explained it.  Way to get but hurt though.  I don't plan on going anywhere in judo. I already got pretty far in wrestling and have been pretty successful in bjj. Your not going to make me feel bad about my grappling acumen.  Edit:got insta down voted by old people.  This is why I don't like blindly respecting people. I have been quite transparent in my lack of info on this topic of katas.  But I'm young and ignorant.  Totally..... this is why judo is dying because of your mindsets.
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,1 point,Thu Feb 5 10:45:58 2015 UTC,"So, basically, you don't have the faintest idea of what a judo kata is, yet you feel qualified to say they are ""stupid"".  And then you wonder why people get offended and downvote you."
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,2,Thu Feb 5 22:24:16 2015 UTC,I thought I did. Now that I have seen it I wasn't far off. I can not enjoy Kata's. I respect that people enjoy them and its apart of the history but you can learn the techniques without it. People in here are really defensive of Kata's. I honestly thought after I was corrected it would be like wrestling drilling. Its not its more akin to Karate Katas albeit more functional but all the same.   I apologize to anyone in here if I was rude. I love judo. I love the judo I train. It may be rude but I will cherry pick what I want from the art. If some see it as a all or nothing well thats their prerogative.   I was wrong to call it stupid. It has its value as it is beautiful in some ways but for the people who don't want to do it there should be issue with it.   This is very telling of the differences in cultures in wrestling and Judo. If you think I am an ass do not let that reflect on wrestling I may have been brash but upon watching what was sent to me I feel confident in saying I don't have any urge to ever learn Kata's of any martial art. Though I can appreciate it.  Again sorry /r/judo I love this sub. Sometimes Im a bit bold but I get pissed at what Judo has become instead of what it could be.  cheers.
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,1 point,Thu Feb 5 22:47:24 2015 UTC,Watched your vids. I want no part in that 'excellence' I have nothing against it but I can not want any part of it and respect judo.

judo,2uqwqg,KarateCowboy,0,Thu Feb 5 10:51:39 2015 UTC,Lol. Because I see no value in getting good at that?  My god you traditionalists.  Some people only value those techniques there's biting wrong with that.  I feel for you if you aren't open to other people wanting to pick and choose what they want.    I've learned most of judo in wrestling almost all those throws exist in some form in wrestling.  There's over lap. I feel for you because you don't understand this.  Hopefully one day it's all just 'grappling' I hold no real loyalty to a art other than wrestling because it's the most effective.
judo,2uqwqg,caseharts,2,Thu Feb 5 10:58:42 2015 UTC,"Practice without principle becomes hollow. It's all about winning and nothing about the spirit of learning, growth, and development. Know what's practical? Doping. It makes you stronger and thus helps you win. It's very practical in that way. Doping is a great example of the disadvantages of the practical mind. An everyday life example: if you have a tear on a cushion on your couch, it would be practical to use duct tape. It's quick, easy and duct tape is strong. Much faster than taking it to be stitched --or stitching yourself. However, the solution lacks grace and in the long run is not as good as the principled approach of stitching the tear."
judo,2uqwqg,farkoman,3,Wed Feb 4 17:03:42 2015 UTC,You use some great examples but there is practicality within norms and you did not represent that well. I disagree that its hollow. Maybe we are not seeing eye to eye on what practicality is but in wrestling none of this exists and I far prefer it. I love Judo but I am not a fan of the old world tradition even if I respect it.
judo,2uqwqg,KarateCowboy,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"how is there no tradition in Wrestling? it's just a different type. As far as im considered tradition in Judo for the most part is a great balance, it's smack in the middle of 'cult-like' and 'anarchic' . It all serves a purpose, whether direct or indirect."
judo,2uqwqg,mrpopenfresh,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:18:54 2015 UTC,there is definitely tradition but the formality is very limited. For example singlets are looking like they might be phased out over the next few years. At least theres a push for it and I hope they do. Singlits are dumb. A good example of formality in wrestling that is annoying is when youre in a tournament and a team has an injury or is missing a weight class. youre wrestler has to go out there and get his hand raised. In reality its stupid and most dislike it but it exists to this day. Another is shaking hands in wrestling stance before the match/shaking the opposing coaches hand win or lose. I like those things. Those similarly respectful things in Judo I have no issue with. But there is no such thing as a Kata in wrestling and we don't need lessons separate from wrestling to reinforce our wrestling. The art of learning and competing molds you. your team mates push you and your coach instills fire and respect in you.   Wrestling has formalities and traditions I do and don't like but there are far less and IMO wrestling is more efficient of a martial art on and off the mat at building a effective martial artist and a good person.
judo,2uqwqg,Brian175,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"It is what it is I guess, as long as you don't bother training time then it's all good. I've met people sort of like you who enroll but then bitch and whine and completely bring negativity into training time.   My sensei equates Kata to just exersice. Practicing O-goshi = kata. doing push ups = hypothetically a kata. So would practicing a suplex not equal a kata, just in Japanese terminology? I mean you can't always do randori 100% of the time and you can't go all out wrestle all the time and you can't knock people out in stand up all the time. You'd run out of training partners and get hurt before a real match real quick.  mcdojo karate and taekwondo, they started this ""kata competition"" crap for the casuals, moms, dads, kids."
judo,2uqwqg,SVPPB,0,Wed Feb 4 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"LOL. thanks for the kind responses and characterizing me as bitching and whining. I've been to judo gyms where they do katas just like karate and I would say that the actual skill level of the teacher was decently high. Your sensei may equate kata to drilling, but that is not as common in my experience. There are legit Judo gyms that have that stuff. Under your sensei's definition drilling seems to equal kata which is fine.   Anyone who bitches about drilling is an idiot. Bitching about what I referred to Katas is not the same thing. I hope you can understand that. But again thanks for trying to equate me to those people. That would be like me immediately thinking you're one of those dumbasses who supports the rule changes and banning of leg attacks. I didn't do that because I don't make assumption immediately. edit: spelling"

judo,2uqwqg,Brian175,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"Oh Yah! There's definitely value within practicality! I didn't mean there is no value. Those were examples of raw practicality in the extreme, without a mind for principle. A nice mixture of principle and practicality is desired. The old world traditions are good so long as they maintain their original purpose. In his ""Tao of Jeet Kune Do"", Bruce Lee talked about ""The classical mess"", where traditions were there simply for the sake of tradition. In another book, he spoke of when he was studying kung fu in Hong Kong, about how schools would have actual exhibition fights between schools, with no pads or gloves or anything. He said ""Nobody really got hurt because the styles weren't all that effective"". That was because of the Classical Mess he was talking about, and you are alluding to. Whole styles and methods of fighting that could be mostly worthless --like moving like monkey or something, all because some revered teacher centuries ago thought it was ""neat-o!"" and tradition has maintained and proliferated it.   For the most part, in my experience, the Japanese arts maintain their traditions without falling into the Classical Mess. Perhaps that's why Lee was willing to praise the Japanese for doing, as he described it, ""establishing a regimen"" to classes, training, and advancement. As long as the traditions and rituals have meaning that they fulfill, and that purpose is taught along with the tradition, then the Classical Mess will generally be thwarted. For example, in Aikido you bow and say 'onegeishimasu' before drilling with your partner. Why? Because your partner is giving you his body to practice a dangerous move on, so you should be careful not to hurt him. Bowing is a sign of respect, and the action imbues respect, and if you respect your partner you will be careful with him('onegeishimasu' is basically a verbal term that expresses respect -a verbal salute). Besides, as my old sensei liked to say: if you break your toys you have nothing to play with. If the sensei claps his hands to get your attention, then you bow quickly and say 'domo arigatou'  before hustling over to crowd around sensei before he demonstrates something. The bow is to respect and value the training you just did, acknowledging the effort and companionship, as well as to say thank you for your time and effort. EDIT: I, personally, always found this little ritual encouraging. It acklowledges the value of the drilling you did, even if you made mistakes, and even though it was only a little. Kind like logging weight lifting in a journal. There's a certain satisfaction to it that helps keep you going; little rituals that prevent burnout and frustration."
judo,2uqwqg,mrpopenfresh,3,Wed Feb 4 18:49:54 2015 UTC,I don't think we disagree here. I just hate formality. Even in wrestling there is a bit its just very limited. I do hate what you refer to as the classical mess. I also hate belts. I hate rankings with them all that crap. I care about what you can do on the mat and what you have done. A belt means very little to me and in general I am not very fond of martial arts using them. Even in BJJ I hate them with a violent passion. Formality IMO is bad for martial arts. I would prefer if all existed in the way wrestling does. but wrestling is unique in its culture and thats fine. I appreciate all the others I just dislike how they are taught in some ways. Its just a personal belief of mine. I believe in cutting everything down and being simplistic. Respect is earned never given and a belt is not replacement for me seeing someone on the mats and rolling with them.
judo,2uqwqg,Brian175,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:08:48 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of Classical Mess in Japanese systems, including in aikido, traditional jujutsu, lots of karate, and yes, some in judo.  Judo has randori and shiai, which tends to resolve a lot of Classical Mess problems, but most other Japanese systems have no equivalent. And no, point sparring is not an equivalent.  As for all the bowing stuff, it seems kinda silly to me, but I can't imagine it helps or hurts as much as many westerns think. Substance is more important than style."
judo,2uqwqg,mrpopenfresh,2,Wed Feb 4 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"It's true that point sparring is not the equivalent of randori. After all, the tap and the ippon allow you to go full force. Nevertheless, karate is not so flowery as kung fu, especially the animal styles. Hence, it is more practical and less Messy.  Personally, having spent a fair amount of time in Japan, across several trips, I feel the bowing and showing of respect is substance and not style. The courtesy and respect of the Japanese is a wonderful thing. I remember coming home one time I actually went through a bit of a reverse culture shock. Lined up in customs, the person being seen was finished and left. The man at the counter didn't even look up at me from the desk. He just waved his hand impatiently ""NEEEEEEeext"", in an annoyed fashion. I was taken aback. Respect matters in how we treat people, and especially so in martial arts; this is a matter of combat arts, which were designed to submit, destroy, and kill others."

judo,2uqwqg,mrpopenfresh,4,Wed Feb 4 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"As a non-native English speaker, I'm perfectly cool with the Japanese names. Japanese serves as an universal language and allows us to talk judo with anyone, anywhere.  If I mention seoi otoshi, you know exactly what technique I'm talking about. If I say that I prefer the Ippon Seoi Otoshi variation, or  Eri Seoi Otoshi, any judoka in the world will understand.  I do think that translating the names is much more newbie friendly, and that's why my club has a readily accesible set of large wood sheets with the picture of each waza, the Japanese name, and a Spanish translation.  BJJ people have to learn names that are every bit as mystifying as Japanese (Ezequiel choke? Americana?)."

judo,2umj99,Suey13,2,Tue Feb 3 22:44:56 2015 UTC,"I go to a community judo club. The monthly rate is $75 CAD, and includes 4 1.5 hour classes a week. We often have to miss a few classes every month due to conflicts with other groups using the same space, so it works out to about $3.50 CAD per hour.  I would pay more than that if I could (as far as I'm concerned judo is a necessary expense like food or rent). On a graduate student stipend paying much more than that would be difficult, but I'm very lucky that our head sensei has asked me not to pay anything anymore, and I help out as much as I can at the club."

judo,2ui8od,geographicfap,3,Mon Feb 2 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"One problem I foresee could be a small safety issue. One of the main principles of judo is mutual benefit and welfare, and as such, we're taught to give our partners an amount of support during a throw, to minimize injuries during training. This is primarily done by pulling up on the sleeve a bit as they land, to cushion the fall a little. In the past, I've run into difficulty with the more tight fitting BJJ gi, which has a tendency to pop out of your grip more easily. Make sure you devote a lot of time to practicing your ukemi waza (falling techniques) to avoid taking some big thumps."

judo,2ui8od,Scypio,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:39:14 2015 UTC,This is a common misconception. Cheap judo gis are cheaper than cheap bjj gis.   Expensive judo gis cost more than expensive  bjj gis.

As a few people have already mentioned, you couldn't compete in one.  Also, some big judo clubs will buy a bunch of decent white judo gi's in common sizes and get a good price that beats internet one-on-one pricing, so it never hurts to check on this if you get started somewhere.

judo,2uexuu,WonkeyGiraffe,7,Sun Feb 1 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"I don't coach kids but I've helped in the past.   I can't help much on warm ups but they absolutely love bull dog at the end of the session, you can make it judo orientated by having them on their knees and only when they've been turned onto their back are they 'caught'."
judo,2uexuu,Kosoto_Gake,3,Sun Feb 1 18:12:59 2015 UTC,Someone at my club referred to this game as 'injury roulette'.
judo,2uexuu,poor_code_monkey,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:58:43 2015 UTC,This was my favourite part when I was younger. You can also use this opportunity to have your kids practice pins if you implement a rule where they are only caught when pinned for more than 3 seconds.   I strongly recommend this!
judo,2uexuu,Killahills,3,Tue Feb 3 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"As a regular watcher of my sons judo class I can confirm that bulldog is always popular. For warm up games they often all get in crab or bear position and play tag, when tagged they have to hold position until someone crawls under them. Another popular game is where they get into pairs with someone of similar size and then line up on opposite sides of the mat from their partners, each pair is allocated a number and then coach throws a knotted belt into the middle and calls a number, the two kids have to crawl to the belt and try and get it back to their side of the mat. It generally turns into a little tug of war and is good for grip strength etc."
judo,2uexuu,H3llsJ4nitor,3,Sun Feb 1 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"I coach kids as well. Usually I split practice in a few parts. Warmup, techniques, randori and then games. It can of course vary, you dont want to always do the same thing. My two favorite games for after randori would be(translating from german here) ""Mat fight"" and ""werewolf"".  For mat fight you use one of those thick mats that you can fall on really softly. The kids are split in two teams, put in order of weight or strenght. Each team starts off with their lightest, they have to get on the mat, it starts and ends like a judo match. The goal is to get the opponent to touch the ground, to basically throw/push him off the mat. The winner can stay on the mat and the loser has to sit back down.  In werewolf you designate a number of kids who have to get on their knees and have to chase the rest. If they catch someone and pull them to the ground this kid is also a werewolf. It goes on until only one is left, it can stop there with a winner or go on until everyone is a werewolf.  Hope I could give you some ideas!   Edit. I'd actually love to hear about how other coaches here structure their practices and if you have some advice or ideas!"
judo,2uexuu,Killahills,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:10:55 2015 UTC,"Ha....they do something like 'mat fight' at my sons club but in the UK we call it 'King of the Castle'. Similar game, all the kids line up in ascending size order then the smallest two face off on a crash mat. They start in a kneeling position and no standing is allowed, have to try and push the other kid off or at least until a body part touches the floor. Winner stays on and next biggest kid steps up. If you don't have crash mats they also play a similar sumo game by marking a ring out with belts."
judo,2uexuu,IFeelLikeBasedGod,2,Mon Feb 2 00:38:56 2015 UTC,Thanks to you all so far :-) bulldog seems to be popular everywhere! All these ideas are really helpful. Hope there are some more by tomorrow
judo,2uexuu,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Sun Feb 1 21:55:52 2015 UTC,"King of the Mat is always fun, no matter how old you are.  The two smallest people go, then the winner faces the third smallest, then that winner faces the fourth and so on. I don't know how old of a group we're talking about, but if the winner is at least like 12 or thirteen or something then have the winner face you or another coach.  We did this a ton in middle school wrestling, and I as heavyweight would come 1st or second a lot. I feel like Judo would give the smaller kids a decent chance, as it is much less strength dependent."

judo,2udbnx,rockermx,-7,Sun Feb 1 04:11:43 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's uchi mata. There isn't really the springing hip action that is characteristic of hane goshi.
judo,2udbnx,BootsLikeMafia,10,Sun Feb 1 07:16:02 2015 UTC,There is even less inner thigh that is characteristic of uchi mata.

judo,2udbnx,dave_attenburz,1 point,Tue Feb 3 12:46:20 2015 UTC,Tori's right leg is clearly touching the right leg off uke. So I'm not sure what you are seeing.
judo,2udbnx,judokalinker,1 point,Tue Feb 3 13:14:21 2015 UTC,Yeah but the important contact is still on the inside of that right leg. You can attack either of uke's legs with uchi mata.
judo,2udbnx,dave_attenburz,1 point,Tue Feb 3 15:29:09 2015 UTC,the inside of that right leg.    Still not seeing that. Looks like the front of the thigh to me.
judo,2udbnx,judokalinker,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"Draw a line down the middle of your thigh, anything on the crotch side of each leg is the inner thigh.   Uchi mata is any throw that lifts an opponent using contact of tori's lifting leg on these faces while torquing his upper body with your arms.   At least imo. But if the argument for this not being uchi mata rests on the idea that the leg contact is not on the inner thigh it doesn't hold up."
judo,2udbnx,dave_attenburz,3,Tue Feb 3 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone is debating hane goshi vs. uchi mata. It did look more like a hip throw to me than uchi mata, but I was more impressed with uke's ukemi. You could put that in a textbook."
judo,2udbnx,dermanus,4,Sun Feb 1 16:48:22 2015 UTC,that's not uchimata. that's hane goshi
judo,2udbnx,c0de2010,2,Sun Feb 1 09:14:33 2015 UTC,Is losing your balance and landing in an inferior position considered good judo?
judo,2udbnx,SVPPB,2,Sun Feb 1 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"Generally, no. It's fine for competition to commit to a throw, but a good judoka should be able to throw with a minimum of effort. At minimum you should be in a position to quickly apply a pin, choke or joint lock.  Kind of like how often you see people pulling guard in BJJ competitions. It wouldn't be a good idea if you were in a self-defence context, but it does make sense given the rule set you're competing under."
judo,2udbnx,dermanus,2,Mon Feb 2 01:40:52 2015 UTC,"I know, I was just pointing it out. In my opinion, overcommitting like that means that you lack control over uke, and therefore the throw should be scored as waza-ari.  You can then reflect on your mistakes while your opponents pins or chokes you."
judo,2udbnx,SVPPB,1 point,Mon Feb 2 10:20:50 2015 UTC,"It's Uchi-mata in my opinion. It's the same force couple principle like in O-soto-gari in terms of biophysics and hane goshi doesn't work that way. The position of the leg is not that important. Ono couldn't get his leg in against Legrand in 2013 but it was still the principle of uchi-mata.  It's hard to find good videos about hane-goshi, but i think these two will do it: http://youtu.be/BtzE5oYa7DQ http://youtu.be/VbpVG-oC-To"
judo,2udbnx,trumfnator,3,Sun Feb 1 12:27:17 2015 UTC,They still classified Ono's as hane goshi.   After events they study techniques and have a team that classifies them. By the time they got round to posting 2013's WC highlights they'd obviously done this and neil adams called it hane goshi on the recording.
judo,2udbnx,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"Point taken, is there anything to read about? Because Neil Adams commentary goes not really beyond ""look at the bent leg"" (which again is not what make hane goshi hane goshi) and he uses the phrase ""spring hip"" but doesn't really explain why ono's technique is a ""spring hip"".  I realized i've taken a bad example, because a discussion about ono's technique has not much to do with this one we see in op's post.  In the end, the edge between uchi mata and hane goshi is rather thin anyway. In this ""one step uchi mata"" video from Koji Komuro you can clearly see aspects of hane goshi (and i think he's explaining this): http://youtu.be/L5_d_3UDrY0  or look at this video with Inoue: http://youtu.be/J2nxb2l5ATI People who say the technique of this topic is hane goshi would judge this technique also as hane goshi."

judo,2udbnx,jpdehart,2,Sun Feb 1 21:14:14 2015 UTC,In many ways ashi guruma is closest to tai toshi. You certainly need to keep your hips clear and off to the side so that uki can rotate over your ankle. In this throw Uki rotates over Tori's arse.
judo,2udbnx,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:40:32 2015 UTC,The leg that blocks is on the outside (front) of the leg and you wheel him over. It's a quite different principle :)

judo,2u9bzu,realyfunky,3,Sat Jan 31 06:46:33 2015 UTC,There is a throw called tsuri-goshi (lifting hip) where you have to really commit your hips into him quickly as he starts to push up against your hand holding him bent down.
judo,2u9bzu,realyfunky,2,Sat Jan 31 06:48:27 2015 UTC,"This is excellent response, thank you.  As I mentioned, I am a smaller judoka, standing about 5'7"". Can I implement this consistently?

judo,2u9bzu,Botenmango,2,Sat Jan 31 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'3 and heavy for my height so I've had to use a similar but modified tactic. rather than reaching over the top for the belt, I snap the head down and step back or back and to the side. from there, uke usually feels compromised and weak so they will fight to regain their posture, stepping forward or back and jerking their own head back up, essentially jumping into a seoinage if they step forward or sucking me in for an easy ouchi or kouchi gari."

judo,2u9bzu,PopularScyence,2,Wed Feb 11 18:27:01 2015 UTC,"in BJJ we are sensitive to getting snapped down because of the guillotine choke- most folks will respond to the snap-down, but you can use this to get them to over commit to standing straight to expose their hips.  Someone else suggested foot sweeps, I think that is a good way to get us to open up too. In BJJ we do poor-man's Judo and hardly anyone is adept at foot sweeps, you will get a lot of BJJers to do something stupid if you attack foot sweeps.  Another way to use the sumi is to bait the single-leg takedown (if you are allowing wrestling takedowns), and get the georgian grip when they commit.   Another way to get a crouched BJJer to react to your advantage is a 2-on-1 arm drag, they will either step forward (attack that leg) or pull back and posture up sometimes and you can attack their other leg with ouchi/kouchi or osoto (works on BJJers, we suck at Judo)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elQUepOQ4Gc#t=68  You can also attack a sumi from the 2-on-1 arm drag:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A3e0wALP1w#t=53  Forgive the instruction quality, it is probably not up to Judo standards but you get the strategies here"
judo,2u9bzu,aronnax512,13,Sun Feb 1 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"I've gotten this response twice now so I feel compelled to respond. I gave him the correct solution for his situation as Georgian with a belt grip (rather than a back grip) is a much stronger position. I was viewing it as a mechanical problem that a new player was struggling with in randori and gave him the best way I knew of to counter broken posture with upright posture.  If we're looking at it from a sport Judo perspective (where you'd be penalized for holding onto their belt for a bit) and someone was insisting on staying bent over you'd use an entirely different strategy. The correct response in that situation is to use a more traditional grip, make just enough foot sweeps to avoid an inactivity penalty and wait for the other guy to rack up shidos because he's staying in a defensive position. It entails no significant risk on your part and they'll be forced to play upright or you'll win. It also reminds me why I stopped bothering with shiai."

judo,2u9bzu,CocunutHunter,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:16:19 2015 UTC,"Time, and training, will bring the rest, but only if you are interested. Honestly, though, learning the proper names will stand you in good stead."
judo,2u9bzu,elimik31,5,Sat Jan 31 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"What he did was a purely defensive stance. He can't throw you like that because the distance is too large. The long-distance sweeps should be no serious thread for an experienced judoka and when he tries to get near for a throw, you know what he want's to do and you can do your own thing. If he stays bent down and you stand straight, in an official competition, you would easily win by shidos.   However, I assume that's not what you want do do/know, so I recommend the advice of aronnax512. By controlling him with your grip you can make life really uncomfortable for him. Just as a notice for competition Judo, after grabbing his belt, a throw should come shortly afterwards. In most cases though, when you have this grip, a throw should be no problem ;)"
judo,2u9bzu,cascadecombo,5,Sun Feb 1 00:12:49 2015 UTC,"The ref will penalize him for stalling.  You probably learn sport judo, and this is the exact reason among others that leg grabs were banned.    Also collar grip into a drag uchimata"
judo,2u9bzu,cascadecombo,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:45:21 2015 UTC,"I'd be thrilled if this happened in a judo comp - if I'm on the offensive and he's just trying not to get thrown, either penalties will force him to abandon his stance or I'll win by shidos. I'm more worried about BJJ/self defense."
judo,2u9bzu,Anthony126517,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:59:45 2015 UTC,"That is why i mentioned the second part.  I come from a wrestling background, so i sometimes have a habit of taking a lower stance sometimes when i feel the guy is much stronger than me.  bad habit but yeah, one guy, would just force an uchimata by pulling me by the lapel, he was of course pretty strong, but there are some options"
judo,2u9bzu,Bag_of_Drowned_Cats,5,Sat Jan 31 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"Lol honestly people who only train only Judo or BJJ don't understand the goals are different in both sports. In Judo most BJJ guys stall and that's ok most throws would probably be hard to pull off because the guy might be good at defending them. One thing that works well is foot sweeps that get bjj guys off guard standing over on that.  In BJJ most Judo guys have a hard time with low-stance shooting from the outside and doing any leg takedowns it's normal,Also pulling guard is new for a judoka and passing guard alot & never go to turtle and just stay there you will get submitted. If your a Judoka lower your stance abit and use kuzshe to throw quick to land in side control and if they shoot from the outside you sprawl.   Judo & BJJ are similar but yet very different. Judoka should win under Judo rules 75% of the time & BJJ under BJJ rules would probably win 75% of the time. Cross-training is the best way to understand the other. In Judo low-stance is wrong but in BJJ a low-stance is good for shooting for legs."
judo,2u9bzu,DatGuyKaj,2,Sat Jan 31 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"Double lapel grip, snap down, lunge in with uchi mata when they react upwards.  That's what works for me.  Kind of like this. http://imgur.com/oHLMI3v  In general, keep harrying him with kumi-kata; snap downs, pulls, changing direction. Get him reacting to what you're doing. Then take advantage when the cracks start to show.  When someone is doing something you don't like, punish them for it."

judo,2u9bzu,DIBanko,1 point,Sat Jan 31 14:19:51 2015 UTC,Others have some good advice..I'd like to reiterate the usefulness of a collar Uchi mata. Snap them downwards first with kuzushi so they react upward then pull up and out while launching your uchi.
judo,2u9bzu,V4vincent,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:11:02 2015 UTC,"I'd keep going with the Uchi Mata, but your setup for the throw is just as important as the throw itself. How are you setting up the throw?"
judo,2u9bzu,singlerainbow,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:03:32 2015 UTC,"I establish a high collar grip, establish dominant head position (top of my head on his temple). I lift him up a little, trying to get him to put as much weight as possible forward, then snap him down, my intention being to throw for uchi mata if it brings his weight down and drop seoi nage/kata guruma if he brings it up to overcompensate. He had really good balance, though (gymnastics and cheerleading background), which made it very difficult to pull him off-center, and his collar hand was always there to stop my hips. I know that would be illegal in a pure judo competition, but it's important that I know how to deal with it if I want to accomplish anything in BJJ, so I didn't mention it."

Get the the head and arm and shuck him.  Seat belt and suplex. edit: why is this downvoted. You can? The more tradition strategy is to go for georgian stuff or to straighten him out id guess but it doesnt mean you cant get him down.

judo,2u3jf2,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"Whilst they are all devastatingly beautiful ippons, 10, 9 and 3 are favourites.   The footwork employed to set up 10 is exquisite. Reaction, reaction, smash!   Wow, 9, the commitment and determination towards the technique and resulting ippon can't be replicated within a thousand nagekomis. Truly superb, I love fighters who will strive for an ippon in any form of technique.  What I really liked about 3 is the way he gives that high pull prior to the throw. That lift is what makes the throw so efficient and I believe that many people are not shown this enough in judo. High pull drills as part of a warm up aren't employed enough!"
judo,2u3jf2,beambeam1,2,Mon Feb 2 11:21:21 2015 UTC,Can't agree with you more. I just came back from a session where I was working on setting up throws and no 10 is simply beautiful.

However it is not a Shido when a contestant, Tori or Uke has Kumikata with a minimum of one hand, either Tori or Uke has the possibility to hug the opponent for a throw (Bear hug). No Shido.""  My interpretation after reading the rule:  Bear hugs are legal IF uke has at least one grip.  With this knowledge, and after reviewing the video my opinion:  Good call, IPPON.

judo,2u2b4v,death_of_field,3,Thu Jan 29 08:37:35 2015 UTC,"Syllabuses (Syllabi?) are decided at the association level. This means that in some countries like the UK, moving from club to club can change the meaning of the belt.   Beyond that, even within the same association, different clubs will grade to different standards - does knowing ogoshi just mean you know what the technique should look like, or that you can demonstrate clearly to a class, or that you can land it in randori? So there is a lot of slack in deciding  when people are ready to grade, even if the syllabus is the same.  Internationally, we can't even agree on what belt colours we should be using. There's no chance of agreement with anything else."
judo,2u2b4v,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Thu Jan 29 09:58:44 2015 UTC,Hmm... I haven't considered the thought that there might be McDojos in Judo.  Is that a possibility?
judo,2u2b4v,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Thu Jan 29 11:03:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you start your own association, your club can be as crap and expensive as you want it to be. However, in some countries like France, it's actually illegal to start a judo association - there is one association and that's it.  Within associations, there are normally some forms of checks that stop truly bad people being promoted by a sketchy club, either external examiners or external competition requirements.  Belt testing fees and the like are often set by the association so there is no room for milking students."
judo,2u2b4v,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Thu Jan 29 11:22:15 2015 UTC,I would hope that randori would weed out the sketchy places right away.
judo,2u2b4v,Ryvai,2,Thu Jan 29 11:47:26 2015 UTC,"It weeds out some sketchy places. As an example of how bad things can get while still doing randori, there's a family club near where I lived that was run by really nice people that had been doing judo under their own association for many years.  They all know the standard techniques, and do randori for around half an hour every session, but they have very little knowledge of grip fighting and don't do any kushushi (balance/posture breaking) training when practising throws. So basically, they have a huge amount of trouble landing throws on resisting opponents, and don't know how to spot someone setting up a throw. So someone from a normal club can just walk up to them, take their favourite grip and throw them at will. But, someone untrained won't know how to throw them.  No one realises what they're missing until they do randori with well trained people, and even then they rationalise their losses -  maybe that one guy who stopped by and mopped the floor with us was just a freak."
judo,2u2b4v,skubasteve54,2,Thu Jan 29 12:15:01 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, thanks.   I was originally hoping to find a standardised curriculum but I guess that's out of the question."
judo,2u2b4v,skubasteve54,1 point,Thu Jan 29 13:00:39 2015 UTC,"The Gokyo (outlined and created by Kano Shihan himself) is the underlaying international standard, anything that differs from that, is non-standard. However some organisations create national syllabus which would make it ""standard"" in that particular nation or organisation, but that does not mean it is an international standard for progress."
judo,2u2b4v,Ryvai,3,Thu Jan 29 13:48:02 2015 UTC,"In the dojo, the syllabus depends on the individual instructor. General outlines are provided by the Judo Association the dojo belongs to. Each association has a standard list of requirements for promotion for every rank. (technical skill, time in rank, judo knowledge, japanese language, competition, etc.) Being an Yudansha in a internationally recognized Judo Association requires a regular criminal background check, which helps eliminate any 'seedy-ness'.  In the United States there is: the USJA (United States Judo Association), USJF (United States Judo Federation), USJI (USA Judo). The USJA and USJF are 'grass roots' organizations, and are recognized internationally (meaning rank within one organization is transferable to another, for a fee...). (e.g. my Sandan from USJA can be transfered to the Kodokan, or the IJF, or the PJC, or wherever.) This is useful if you plan to travel to another country, and wish to participate in a Judo club that has a 'local' association requirement. Also noteworthy, every country is different and it is worthwhile to maintain your own records for future travel to these Countries if you plan to practice Judo, which i recommend you do.  USA Judo is the national governing body for International Judo. All three organization's are recognized by the IJF and the Kodokan, and you can belong to as many judo organization's as you please. (some dojo's will have their clubs registered in more than one, especially if there are competitors interested in National/international competition).  The requirements of the Judo Organization's within the US are pretty similar. The day to day maintenance of each Dojo rely heavily on the individual Sensei running the class. There will be a large variety of teaching styles from Dojo to Dojo, instructor to instructor.  Judo clubs are typically 'classified' as either recreational, or competition oriented. The day to day syllabus will depend on the emphasis of the class, reputation of the dojo, and the reputation of the instructor.  Hope that helps."
judo,2u2b4v,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"With Judo being a part of the Olympics and having the Kodokan as a recognised HQ, I didn't think that it would still be heavily politicised with all these different organisations!"
judo,2u2b4v,Ryvai,2,Thu Jan 29 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Having organization's is a good thing in such an international environment. But there are definitely political drawbacks.  If you're beginning to learn, join the grassroot organization that your dojo is probably already supporting/registered with.  If you're going to compete, join your national 'IJF Sanctioned' org, you can transfer rank between organizations, for a fee.  -Steve"
judo,2u2b4v,Ryvai,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Where I'm located, there is a central organisation that looks after the majority of judo schools in this state.  But I know that politics plays a part of what goes on here, some member schools are reluctant/begrudging members to participate in state-wide or national competitions only.  There are a couple of other schools who refuse to be members at all."
judo,2u2b4v,Ryvai,2,Fri Jan 30 11:16:28 2015 UTC,"Many schools vastly differ in syllabus. The underlying principle of progress comes from the Gokyo, which is recommended (for several reasons). The reason for this discrepancy in syllabus is probably because many schools do not properly understand the Gokyo (reference: Kodokan president Uemura's New Year's speech 2015). Some schools even adjust the syllabus because they struggle with teaching the difference between sasae-tsurikomi-ashi and hiza-guruma to kids. I'm not saying it is easy, but perhaps the understanding of the techniques is lacking. I don't know :)"
judo,2u2b4v,Ryvai,2,Thu Jan 29 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I understand that there is a set list of throws for example, that's why I thought there might be a syllabus. I suppose different schools might pick and choose which ones to grade at each belt level if they don't understand the Gokyo."
judo,2u2b4v,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Thu Jan 29 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"There are 67 throws defined in Kodokan Judo, but the Gokyo consists of only 40 throws, all containing countless variations, which are meant to be learned in order, based on a pedagogical philosophy of incremental challenges for uke and tori, not just technical difficulty for tori. The gokyo-no-waza is so simple to follow, that a 10 year old can understand it, what I mean by not 'understanding' it is that most people don't know the reasoning why it should be taught in that order, which is why messing with it, is a bad idea.  This is a simple picture of the gokyo-no-waza with colors that represents the different levels. Techniques should be taught (more or less) in that order, and supplementing certain techniques in between from the total 67 techniques with variations to fit the student, like certain competition throws that the instructor is comfortable with the student performing, based on skill level :)"

judo,2u15ow,Ryvai,2,Thu Feb 5 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"All the judo nage-waza are refered to as 'throws'. This can be done in many ways, literally throwing someone, carrying them then dumping them, sweeping, reaping, hooking or even sacrificing yourself. 'Throw' is just a loose term for them all, i wouldnt think to much of it. Deashi-barai is just a foot-sweep to throw your opponent :p"

judo,2u15ow,SVPPB,5,Thu Jan 29 09:40:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This is pure judo, or maybe sambo.  Deashi Barai is much harder than it looks. If you don't have perfect timing and a strong hand motion, you end up just doing a feeble ankle kick."
judo,2u15ow,NeuroCore,1 point,Thu Jan 29 13:33:20 2015 UTC,What's the strong hand motion? I know what deashi barai is but I'm not sure what you're referring to?
judo,2u15ow,SVPPB,3,Thu Jan 29 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"The hands have to do a steering wheel action to unbalance uke at the same time as the sweep.  Deashi is a difficult throw because you need to achieve perfect timing between your sweep, his step, and your hands."
judo,2u15ow,quixote_arg,2,Thu Jan 29 14:06:01 2015 UTC,if perfectly timed (very hard) it can be done without any hand motion at all :)

judo,2u15ow,BurmaJones,2,Thu Jan 29 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"I've trained at a couple of BJJ gyms and no one has judo like that without cross training in judo, it just doesn't happen.   You'll get guys who've been doing judo for years who can't do de ashi barai on a resisting opponent.   To get good at a throw you need to know the basics which you don't get at a bjj club. I found that when I'd been doing judo for about four years I started to get a bit of a feel for things and you could kind of feel peoples' movements. It's only after that that you start to hit throws as nicely as that on resisting opponents on a regular basis.   TLDR: you don't get a de ashi barai like the one in the video without years of standup grappling.   You might hit the odd one occasionally if you really practise it but the video in the OP doesn't look like luck, it looks more like he's a good grappler."
judo,2u15ow,El_Slayer_Loco,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"That's true. Though our gym does have a dedicated Judo class that's heavily attended, as well as a ""wrestling for BJJ"" class.

judo,2u23zt,brianjester,2,Thu Jan 29 06:53:30 2015 UTC,"You are attempting throws that are way over your level.   Forget about sacrifice throws for a while. You won't have the technique to pull them off in randori yet, and if you do manage to learn one (like taniotoshi), you'll become over reliant in it.  Also, don't try to use taiotoshi in randori. Taiotoshi is one of the most dangerous throws in judo. If you pull on uke while your legs are too close to his, you run the risk of forcefully twisting his whole body while his knee remains locked, destroying his ligaments. If instead you throw him with your rear foot flat on the ground, and he falls over your leg, he'll bust your knee.  My advice is that you should concentrate on a mix of simple sweeps and hip throws: osoto otoshi, osoto gari, ouchi gari, o goshi, uki goshi, ippon seoinage, and after you master these, start working on an arsenal of throws that match your physical attributes and style."

You probably know that there is a marijuana subculture in Brazilian jiujitsu - a lot of bjj players toke up before rolling and say that it makes them more creative and relaxed. The most outspoken advocates for this are Eddie Bravo and Joe Rogan.

You should always ask yourself two questions when partnering up with someone:    How will you benefit most from this? How will your partner benefit most from this?   If your partner is vastly superior to you, do your best and/or follow his/her guidance. If you are vastly superior to your partner, you won't benefit much from ""slamming"" him /her around.

Don't try crazy new things though, you don't want to hurt your opponent, but it's much more satisfactory to try out new gripping strategies or that foot-sweep you've been trying to land for the last year. Makes you achieve something and learn, even against opponents that you can easily hassle :)"
judo,2txyqu,war_lobster,2,Wed Jan 28 16:07:40 2015 UTC,I have a similar situation with a white belt who is easily 50 pounds lighter.   During randori I only let myself grip his gi with two fingers per hand. It helps prevent me muscling him.

judo,2txyqu,Ryvai,3,Wed Jan 28 12:27:16 2015 UTC,"This isn't strictly a judo question, per se, but I have two kind of related questions for BJJ - Firstly, sometimes in BJJ class we start standing and I find I have success when I can grip up, but sometimes they keep distance so much that I can't, they do shoot in (and I sprawl with some success). What should I do to engage with the opponent in terms of getting grips or is there anyone strategy?  My second question is related - what should I do when BJJers keep a very low posture, or basically an already almost broken down posture? I know that this is ideal for certain throws, but I can't remember which."
judo,2txyqu,geocattes,3,Wed Jan 28 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"For better gripping; search YouTube for the term; 'kumi kata', which is just the term judoka use for gripping, there are tons of videos on the subject.  Against bent over opponents; Try pulling them forward (provoking an reaction) then attack them backwards with things like; Ko-uchi-gari, O-uchi-gari. You could try this sweet ankle pick feint beginning @0:18. If you are feeling comfortable with sacrificing yourself, then yoko-tomoe-nage would be a good option."
judo,2txyqu,geocattes,2,Wed Jan 28 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice! I'm comfortable with sacrifice throws and have a fair amount of success with the ones I know (mostly tani otoshi).

With such a grip you can try quite a number of techniques: Tsuri Goshi, Harai Goshi, Soto Maki Komi, Harai Maki Komi and certain variants of Hikikomi Gaeshi (sometimes called Obitori Gaeshi). With other grips, Sumi Gaeshi, other variants of Hikikomi Gaeshi or Tawara Gaeshi are possible. You could also try to enter an armbar."

judo,2txyqu,lanster100,3,Wed Jan 28 14:11:36 2015 UTC,"How do you fight someone who just stiff arms you and holds on with all their strength?    I faced someone like that recently (while trying to learn how to relax myself), and It felt like I couldn't do anything. I couldn't get close enough to them for sweeps or throws.    I did sort of counter their attempts (I won with two waza-aris and a yuko), but my ""throws"" were awkward and un-controlled because of my partner being stiff and because I have no idea how to counter stuff properly."
judo,2txyqu,newhoza,3,Thu Jan 29 00:25:16 2015 UTC,"I'll just copy stuff of my former replies to a similar quesiton:  Ongoing stiff arming is a big problem (interestingly not only for you, but also for the development of your partner, who'll get nowhere as long as he keeps that up). Anyway, there are a few tricks that might help you:   An outstretched arm has one weakness: The elbow. Take the jacket at the outer elbow and push a bit against it (not as much as to hurt your partner) and wait for a reaction. If he bents the elbow, pull it down and to the side. Use his own strength to bend it. If you close in at the same time you may be in a great position to attack. Another way to deal with stiff arms is just walking backwards. He'll either have to follow you (which you may be able to make use of) or he'll have to bend his arms to pull you in. Try to attack from different angles. Stiff arms are the strongest against a frontal attack. Try to attack diagonally or from 45° or even 90° angles. You can pull yourself into a back grip (for tsuri goshi for example) step by step by moving your grip further and further around their back, which increases the pressure on their stiff arm on the same side until it folds. There are some armlocks, that can be applied in such a situation, but unless you really know what you do, I'd advise against them, because there is a certain risk of injury. For a right sided ippon-seoi-nage grip, there's this: grab the sleeve of uke's right arm at the elbow, but not at the outer side. Instead put your hand further under it until you can grab the cloth at the inside. Then pull it tightly outwards. This may bend his elbow. At the same time move your right hand over his left arm and then ""dive"" with your entire right arm and shoulder under his right arm. This has to be done with your entire body of course. It is helpful to initiate it with pushes into the opposite direction(s) first (like pushing his elbow down and inside first). Some throws may even work at stiff arm distance, depending on the length of your and his limbs. Ippon seoi nage actually requires a certain distance for effective, unhindered turning. Uke is pulled onto you after the turn. Hiza guruma or some sutemi waza may be useful as well.   That's all just theory of course. :)"
judo,2txyqu,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Thu Jan 29 06:40:11 2015 UTC,Does anyone know anything about the state of Judo at Texas state university? I got offered a scholarship there and I'm having trouble deciding.

judo,2txyqu,dzendian,2,Wed Jan 28 16:38:28 2015 UTC,I think I have a fear of committing to an attack.  I've never even attempted a throw that requires me to turn around while doing mock shiai because of it.  Is that something other people experience?
judo,2txyqu,dzendian,4,Thu Jan 29 00:20:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's quite natural not wanting to turn your back to the opponent. Very few turn for a throw unless they feel safe doing it. And there's always a certain risk of being countered.  On the other hand, if you never try it, you will never learn it. Being countered and thrown for years, is the price you have to pay for learning doing it properly.  Thus:   Learn proper ukemi. So you are not be afraid of being thrown. Attack! A lot! If you get thrown... who cares? Get back up and try again. ... many hundred or thousand hours of practice later, you'll have become a better judoist. There is no shortcut in judo."
judo,2txyqu,counterpig,2,Thu Jan 29 06:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it's perfectly natural to feel like this. As a white belt you are probably slow, with bad positioning, and you are unlikely to unbalance your opponent. This makes turning your back on your opponent dangerous. This will all get better with practice.  However, full commitment will protect you from an attack. If you're just standing in front of me, and facing the wrong way, I can just pick you up. If you really drive into a throw, it's much harder for me to counter."

Be lose, be playful, try the techniques you practiced, experiment with the given situations. Don't aim for a certain technique, but make use of given opportunities using the technique that suits the situation best. Play an offensive game, don't be afraid of being thrown yourself though. If you leave your ego at home, it won't get bruised."
judo,2txyqu,silvaphysh13,2,Thu Jan 29 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"Is it bad to block throws during randori?  Such as, lowering my hips to avoid a seoi nage?"
judo,2txyqu,counterpig,3,Thu Jan 29 08:20:33 2015 UTC,"Technically it's one of many options to avoid being thrown. One shouldn't remain for long in such a defensive pose though.  If you happen to be much more advanced than your partner in randori, it's nice to let them throw you once in a while, if their attack is technically correct."
judo,2txyqu,Ryvai,2,Thu Jan 29 08:24:10 2015 UTC,"If you happen to be much more advanced than your partner in randori, it's nice to let them throw you once in a while, if their attack is technically correct.   They don't let white belts play with other white belts, so I'm pretty sure all of my partners were more experienced than myself (unless you count the 3 years of judo I did 7-10 years ago, without doing anything at all for the last 7 years).   Technically it's one of many options to avoid being thrown.   Usually I turn that into a throw of some kind (dropping the hips for a seoi nage block is just my first step).  The kuzushi is already there (tori is really off balance, otherwise I contend that I would be completely thrown), and I'm exploiting it backwards.   One shouldn't remain for long in such a defensive pose though.   I've been standing upright (sensei yelled at me for the first two weeks about this) for about 2 weeks now, and relaxed for about 2 classes (just this week).  ...  Tonight I felt I did ok regarding your advice.  I tried to keep it relaxed throughout.  No stiff-arming or locking up or gi clenching.  Stood upright (except to block a seoi nage).  I did surprisingly well and landed many throws, I was also amazed at how much better balance I had.  I know you recommended against trying specific throws only, but what about specific concepts?  During tonight's randori and newaza, I said to myself beforehand: I want to experiment with kuzushi (didn't really care which throw I did and I didn't go for any subs, just pins and passing).  Is that bad to work on one thing like that every now and again?  Finally, I did 2 rounds of newaza tonight and about 4 rounds of randori (no I don't want a medal, but it's relevant to my last question).  My body (and oddly, my right hip?) is killing me.  Hehe.  Since I got back to judo (about 4 weeks ago), I had a bad situation last week and I overdid it (almost passed out).  I'm going to add one more randori or newaza per class per week (next week I'll try 7 rounds).  What do you think of that?  I'm not sure I can iron man it and stay in for all rounds yet.  Thanks!"

I am not totally against trying specific throws in randori, but it is a bit against my idea of judo. You can try to hit with a specific technique over and over again from all sorts of situations though (and this type of training is sometimes recommended for advanced competitors). I think the best idea is doing a balanced training: Do randori where you flow with the game and also do randori where you go for a certain technique.  Practicing general things like kuzushi? Good idea!   I'm going to add one more randori or newaza per class per week (next week I'll try 7 rounds). What do you think of that?   Well... just do as much as you are fine with.

judo,2tsxfr,mmajkd69,7,Tue Jan 27 03:54:21 2015 UTC,"If you overcommit to a throw and get off balance, which is common in judo because you are going for an ippon, it is easier for them to continue to roll you through it.    If you practice throws by keeping control when you finish, it is pretty hard for them to pull you over. Tai otoshi, keep an upright posture."
judo,2tsxfr,judokalinker,3,Tue Jan 27 04:41:28 2015 UTC,"So much this! In judo, you put everything you have into the throw because if your opponent rolls through, you still score, and if you stall, you'll be stood up (therefore eliminating his top-position advantage). In BJJ, you have to stabilize the position to get your takedown points, and if you get turned over, your opponent scores. It's better to fail the takedown than end up on bottom. Try to be more controlled in your execution!"

Try and keep your shoulders above your feet when you throw Tai Otoshi, and this will ensure you stay in a strong upright position.  If you are looking at Tai Otoshi for BJJ, I'd practice repping out the throw and instantly transition to knee on belly, and the juji gatame, armbar for you :-)  should be begging for you to take.

judo,2tsxfr,MrStretchnuts,3,Thu Jan 29 12:40:38 2015 UTC,Maybe you're leaning forward too much as you throw.  Try to keep your back relatively straight. I can see how bending over as you pull uke for tai-otoshi can lead to rolling into the throw.
judo,2tsxfr,academicninja,3,Tue Jan 27 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"Seems like your opponent is simply holding on... which means in order to not end up in the losing position you need to break the grip your opponent has on you while (or slightly before) throwing. Also, you'll need to release your opponent once he is past ""the point of no return"" (i.e. in the air, preferably horizontal) so you don't inadvertently go over with him.  As you've said, it would make for a likely higher score in Judo as you roll over him although from my knowledge of the rules of BJJ it's simply going to leave you in a vulnerable position if he manages to drag you down.  Might suggest taking an underhand grip with your right hand instead of the overhand on the belt. As you're throwing your opponent, if he tries to hold onto your collar or similar, shrug him off as he's going. If you've got the overhand grip, there's not a lot you can do with your opponent's gripping hand and all he needs to do is simply not let go.  Lastly, if you can get a hold of your opponent's sleeve with your left hand, you'll find your opponent will have a lot more difficulty pulling you over using that hand."
judo,2tsxfr,jujiroll,3,Tue Jan 27 07:42:10 2015 UTC,"As judokalinker mentions its pretty hard to do this if your tai otoshi is correct (upright posture).    From your kuzushi I wonder if you mean ""Ogoshi""... a tai otoshi w/ a belt grip would be unorthodox. If it is ogoshi, then its a matter of keeping uke tight as you throw and following him/her to the mat. Practicing throw to pin transitions will help with this."
judo,2tsxfr,academicninja,2,Tue Jan 27 09:40:39 2015 UTC,"a tai otoshi w/ a belt grip would be unorthodox   Not super unorthodox, and it's the way Jimmy Pedro advises to do it against an opponent in the typical BJJ posture.   Though now that I think of it, one of the most common ways for people to mess up tai-otoshi is for them to turn it into a half-assed hip throw."

judo,2tsxfr,Botenmango,2,Tue Jan 27 08:02:56 2015 UTC,"As people have mentioned, you are unbalancing yourself on the throw, which is fine in Judo if you get the Ippon.   Practice the throw, if you can, with an emphasis on keeping your balance after the throw but still keeping hold of your opponent which is useful in BJJ.   One way I achieve this in both BJJ and Judo is by dropping my knee into the rib of my partner (close to the armpit) and keeping close control of the arm. This kills any momentum that my partner might use to roll, and provides the perfect opportunity for an armlock if you are quick."

The problem is that your idea of normal and your doctor's are vastly different.  Unless your doctor specializes in sports injuries and dealing with athletes, they are giving advice that is meant for someone who lives a non-athletic/active lifestyle.  Also, every motion you mentioned uses the knee along it's normal range of motion.  Sweeps put pressure sideways to the knee to stabilize the leg to do the sweep.  My recommendation: continue to baby it for another 2 weeks to a month.  Every time you try to so stuff at a weird angle, like the sweeps, which places force sideways on the knee, you are going to slow healing."

I was lucky I have good flexibility.   I took two months off judo before going back to it. I also did 6 weeks of physiotherapy during that time, and did not go back till the physiotherapist said it was safe.  The doctor did not say I needed physiotherapy, just that it would help.

I asked him what he was thinking with the tomanage and he said it felt right at the time.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB1hPXM_1ic  P.S. here's his first match that /u/BadWeather12 mentioned with the quick ashi waza: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beKrp8VcqJc
judo,2tq03x,joseph_hac,1 point,Mon Jan 26 23:17:47 2015 UTC,Thanks that's kinda helpful. So your cousin changes his stance abit and grabs the leg and looks to pass right as the guy try's to pull guard and gets 4 points off the bat. That's a good one :)
judo,2tq03x,joseph_hac,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. You have to drop your level to the same as theirs. Ideally, you wouldn't hunch over and instead would lower your hips with your stance alone, but this match was a bit extreme and he did have to hunch over a bit to match his opponent's level.   Also, he got 2 points for the takedown and another 3 for the pass. Later on, he gets 4 when he mounts."
judo,2tq03x,cynicoblivion,5,Tue Jan 27 12:54:15 2015 UTC,"BJJ guy here (love browsing the judo subreddits - lots of good info, different techniques). Best thing to do is to grip fight. My judo is limited and not pretty, but my wrestling is reasonable. If someone gets a grip, they have a lot of options - many of which include pulling guard. If you can control your grip points while minimizing their's, there are a lot of great judo throws to be had. Granted, I'm not a judoka, but I thought this might help, as it has vastly improved my wrestling takedown ability recently."

judo,2tq03x,damnmaster,3,Mon Jan 26 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'm no master and I'm sure what I say probably won't work on really good fighters but this is how I handle some bjj fighters I have come across.   You need to take a lower stance, something akin to a wrestler stance when you face these people. So long as your principle is still the same (Your back is straight and strong) you are good.   A tactic I learn't to combat guard pulling is simply to attempt to shove their head into the ground, grab their gi and keep them lower than you. When they resist and try to stand back up, initiate your throw, having constant control with your grip and their balance is key to making sure they can't sit down.   Keeping their head in front of their knees makes anyone extremely off balance, take advantage of their low stance, some get very clumsy and relax their back allowing you to simply pull them straight down into the ground. Counter any move like this on you simply with your strong back.   Learn to sprawl like your life depended on it. I did one seminar class with a wrestling coach and after that I would always incorporate sprawls into my warmup. They are beyond useful for leg defence.   Grab their belt, this one is really hard and often can't be done with ease, simply grabbing their belt puts distance between their hip and yours, thus they can't properly jump guard. I found this advice useful but often very difficult to use in a real fight.   Rush for a quick through. I used to do this thing where the moment the fight started, I would grab their gi and attempt to ragdoll them around the room. To be fair I could only do this for so long until I got tired, but some often get taken by surprise, grab the collar of their gi and shake, jerk it up and down, left and right, get a quick off balance off early and go in for a quick throw. Some BJJ fighters who don't focus on stand up often aren't prepared to be off balanced so early in a fight."
judo,2tq03x,kenbu,3,Mon Jan 26 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"When you have enough experience in Judo (at least 1500 hours imo), oh man fighting any BJJ player without Judo experience is like fighting a White-Green belt Judoka.   Grip fighting will dominate over everything they throw at you.  E.g. grab their left sleeve with your left hand > tension it to your left. Use your right hand to grab their left shoulder/lapel and posture their frontal position to your left angle.   This by it self will eliminate all their guard pulls and jump guards. Then you can drag them towards that angle, pull them up, whatever.   Although with the new IJF rules RE gripping, if you are just starting, you won't get much experience using different grip techniques.   Judo grip fighting trumps standing BJJ players. You just need to get one grip to set them up."

judo,2tq03x,flyingsheepman,1 point,Tue Jan 27 08:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I say let them try to pull guard, and start breaking it immediately by grabbing their gi/inner pant leg on the way down.  I've tried this in newaza and found it to be effective.  Regarding double or single leg shoots, yeah.. Sprawl. Also, after reading jigoro kano's book kodokan judo, you stand upright because it's the most versatile way of adapting, not because it's bullet proof. you may want to try it during bjj practice.  At least it'll expose your legs, which will encourage shooting of the legs which will increase the chances that you can get a really good at practicing sprawling.  Take with 50 grains of sand. I did judo for 3 years about 10 years ago, and I did cross train some jiu jitsu.  I asked my sensei the same questions, and he said basically what I am telling you."
judo,2tplwk,DomAJones,4,Mon Jan 26 11:07:01 2015 UTC,"Uchikomi is about the only thing you can practise on each other at home.   The problem is, you're both beginners and as such there'll likely be many flaws in your technique.   As Neil Adams says: 'repetition makes permanent, not perfection.'"
judo,2tplwk,Kosoto_Gake,2,Mon Jan 26 11:30:01 2015 UTC,"While the guy above me is correct, I would suggest practicing breaking balance by using resistance bands attached to something,  Working on Hikite and Surite (lifting arm and pulling arm) as usually each throw has a version of it.   When I was just starting out I found that I often left out using my arms while going for a throw.  If you're orange belt I imagine you know Osoto, Ogoshi, SeoiNage, Tai-Otosh.   For a better Ogoshi/Seoi I may suggest place a pair of shoes shoulder width apart and just practice tai-sabaki. You will only refine your technique properly during practice, but good tai-sabaki and kuzushi mean a more effective throw (IMHO)"
judo,2tplwk,sawskankredemption,2,Mon Jan 26 11:56:53 2015 UTC,Uchikomi bands are still risky as most people have their elbows on their hikite all over the place and their balance is often off among other things.

Perhaps make a new category on your site for techniques that not officially recognized and put those there? Like the osaekomi ura-gatame is not an official Kodokan technique, but the IJF recognizes it :)  EDIT: Perhaps under e.g. kuzure-kesa-gatame, list the popular variations that come under this category but are not officially recognized, like; makura-kesa-gatame, ushiro-kesa-gatame, and so on. For chokes, try to perhaps place jigoku-jime, oten-jime, and so on, somewhere? :)"

judo,2tianc,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sat Jan 24 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"I predict we will see waza-names for techniques that are now defined as 'chaotic', which means they use principles of two or more categories, or none at all. Ko-uchi-makikomi for example, might be included (it is now kouchi-gari, but in the sutemi-category). We will probably also see some distinction of the various uchimata that is out there; ashi-uchi-mata, koshi-uchi-mata and the quite different ushiro-uchimata, which looks like ura-nage, but you lift front against front with your leg on their inside leg then turn them around mid air. Others might be the hybrid between uki-waza and kata-guruma, which has become increasingly popular because of the leg-grab ban, where you latch on to either side of uke, dive under their arm and dive down to throw them in an otoshi-type motion without grabbing the legs. Some X-otoshi perhaps? I'm not capable of prediction these names, as they will probably be based on Japanese kanji. Another one is the ""reverse-seoi-nage"" where you grab onto their lapel on the same side with both hands and twist in the opposite direction to throw them, right now classified as a form of seoi-nage, but involves various different principles. Ushiro-seoi-nage perhaps? as you throw almost back-to-back Hehe. Time will tell :p"

judo,2tianc,Anthony126517,-5,Mon Feb 2 08:41:40 2015 UTC,Lol I never cared for the names of moves in Japanese lol. All I need is for the move to be useful and work. You can an armbar a Ju-G or ice cream mango but if it has the same effect it's mostly the same move no matter what it's called :p
judo,2tianc,Spooky-Forest,1 point,Sun Jan 25 04:55:50 2015 UTC,"Your right in that a name doesn't make the throw (only technically), but the reality is that most of the names in judo translate into pretty obvious statements (less of funky names, more of what the person doing them is doing). Kouchi Gari (a super common staple footsweep in judo) translates into --> minor inner reaping; which makes more sense when put into the context that ""ashi-waza"" translates into --> Leg techniques.  Kouchi-Gari is an Ashi-Waza. --> Minor Inner Reaping is a Leg Technique.  The problem with lack of naming, is that things become forgotten when they don't have names. Also, it becomes incredibly chaotic and tough to regulate and/or teach throws when there are no names.  Naming is very important. Without names we cannot discuss things outside of a dojo, or without performing/showing them.   I constantly mix up names of techniques, and while it doesn't affect my judo; people sometimes have no idea what I'm talking about until I show them. (Totally different online when I can look up the proper terminology with leisure and time)."

judo,2tk55b,newhoza,2,Sat Jan 24 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"My two cents:  The O Goshi looks fine imho. It's the basic, static version, which teaches beginners the how to turn, place feet, use hands and hips. That's what it does and what it is good for. It's very difficult to apply the technique in randori that way, though. For randori, forms where tori has his hand on uke's shoulder blade before he turns (like the classical version from jigotai) or where tori stands to the side of uke in a 90° angle work better.  The Tsuri Komi Goshi as shown here is fine, too. The classical form (the Nage no Kata version) is somewhat different as far as I know, but again, these are valid basic variants. For application in randori it may be necessary to work differently again.  That Koshi Guruma was odd... needs more preparatory movement, different angle of tori's hip and more wheel like action imho.  The ""wide-stance Uki Goshi"" is something I haven't seen this way before. Uki Goshi is, although being a basic technique, a rather strange one and it seems many judoka have developed their own more or less useful interpretations of Uki Goshi or what they think Uki Goshi is. Somehow I don't like the version shown, but I cannot put the thumb on the actual problem.  Note this: Variations are ok. Every judoka will sooner or later develop his own way to execute techniques. As long as they follow the guideline of maximum efficiency and the defining mechanic of a technique, it is correct.  My advise to you as a whitebelt would be this: First try to emulate what your instructor shows you as accurate as possible. Once you got his/her version down, ask yourself: Does it work for you? Is it strength-efficient? Can you actually apply that in randori? If yes, keep doing it that way. If not, try to figure out why it doesn't work and ask your instructor about it again to find a solution. If this still doesn't help, look into videos and books or even other groups to fine alternate ways to execute the technique, that work better for you."

That was like a hideous Tai Otoshi or seoi o toshi or ashi guruma.   Uki Goshi in my mind it the prepatory technique for many of the most beautiful in judo, uchi mata coming to mind first. It's about incomplete hip contact, lifting, floating or popping uke's hips, and rotating him to your side rather than throwing him over (forward).   my two cents, I am just a brown belt who's given uki goshi, and a lot of hip/legs throws a lot of thought."

I've seen quite a number of variants of uki goshi and -trust me when I say that- this is by far not the worst one I've seen.   It's about incomplete hip contact, ...   That's something where I disagree. Uki Goshi requires very tight hip contact, even if it is only for a short moment. In Kano's version (can be found on youtube), you can see how he leans into uke and pulls uke's hips against his to close the gap between them. This also makes uke float on his feet.  I was also shown a strange version of Uki Goshi that originates from Tokio Hirano, which I have yet to successfully emulate. But there's something for sure: Tori closely ties Uke's body to his."

From what I've heard from folk who've trained with him he's certainly very good at teaching a class (as one would really, given that the BJC 6th dan at least should be expected to be legitimate), but I agree the lack of competition evidence does strike one as a bit suspicious. Referring to grading contests maybe?"
judo,2tk55b,Aratoast,1 point,Sun Jan 25 22:50:46 2015 UTC,There's only so many grading contests you can enter. Unless you go to national gradings you're lucky to get one or two first dans there.  Most likely he just ran small inter club competitions and never faced anyone who was any good. If he'd really wanted to test himself he'd have entered some of the open competitions where all the GB guys get their ranking points.

judo,2tk55b,Bluurgh,1 point,Mon Jan 26 10:31:14 2015 UTC,"From what I found, he split from the BJC because they weren't happy with him promoting people to first dan without doing the competition requirement.

judo,2tk55b,Bluurgh,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"Before i moved to the BJA I was a BJC member for a long while, and I actually had the pleasure of being on a course led by Sampson before he split from the BJC a few years ago. I struggle to believe these accusations that Sampson improperly promoted people to first dan. Sampson was a highly skilled judoka and took gradings very seriously from what I remember. Sampson was very involved with the BJC and supported them for many years. He wouldnt have tarnished his authority by giving out grades to nobodies, anybody he graded was with the authority of the BJC, if he has been misbehaving they wouldnt have held him in such high regard. I believe these accusations may be part of a smear campaign against what he is trying to do now. From what I understand Sampson left the BJC as he felt they had began to go backwards rather than forwards, failing to provide a positive judo structure for their students, and were no longer doing good judo."

Frankly I don't particularly care what the truth is. The whole organisation fosters a pretty negative attitude towards pretty much every other Judo organisation and I've definitely benefited from getting away from that and being able to concentrate on just doing Judo without the politics."

Although it's not really necessary, it's quite a nice gesture and probably helps create and continue that respectful nature amongst everyone else attending the class."
judo,2tdyd9,beambeam1,2,Fri Jan 23 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised, how bad some judo clubs are at ne waza, even if they practice it regularly, since they don't have a proper didactic concept for it and don't put any emphasis on transitions. At least around where I live there's a rule of thumb, that says, that an average BJJ bluebelt can easily beat an average Judo 1st dan on the ground.  This is a big generalization of course, but I have yet to meet any BJJ bluebelt, who has not a solid basic knowledge and ability of ground fighting, while judoists, including blackbelts, are a very, very mixed bag in that regard."

judo,2tdyd9,MuayJudo,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:52:29 2015 UTC,The level of Newaza in Judo blackbelts can be hugely different. I have beaten Judo blackbelts as a BJJ white belt during BJJ classes (pretty sure I had some kind of size advantage in pretty much all these cases though). But also been dominated as if I was fighting a purple or brown belt against others.
judo,2tdyd9,Carlos13th,1 point,Mon Feb 2 11:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, it varies.  There's sadly a lot of shodans who neglected grappling/new waza .  and there's some who are up to par .  It troubles me that some black belts would get demolished by the blue belts I roll with."

Euan Burton (google him if you dont know who he is) came to my bjj club, wore his white belt, and sat at the end of the white belts. My instructor, asked him to sit out front before class. Euan refused - respectful guy!  After class my instructor gave him his purple belt!  Now I'd say that he is a real exception to the rule"

judo,2tdyd9,beambeam1,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:12:27 2015 UTC,"Lol I think it really depends from person to person not ranks. In terms of groundwork I think most first Dan Judo Blackbelts on the ground are probably around a BJJ Blue with 2-3 stripes,some are whites (4stripes) & some are even purples. Same for BJJ'er in Judo standing some are good and some bad. It's kinda hard to compare so I won't even try too. Best thing any grappler can do is crosstrain to fill in the gaps. If your a Judoka or BJJ it's also a good idea to add in some Wrestling,Sambo & more if you got the time."

I guess it depends on what one means by ""style"" in any given context. I could say ""Mifune and Hirano"", both Judoka, ""had an individual fighting style"" One could also use the term style in a sentence like ""BJJ and Muay Thai are two distinct fighting styles.""  Those who praticed Judo at the universities that competed under Kosen rules (which began 1914), put a great emphasis on ne-waza. Their personal ""style"" of Judo was shaped by that training focus.   Rules shape how and what people practice. If we were going strictly by the techniques and not the training methods or rules, BJJ would be no style either, but a rule set..."

judo,2tduxb,mltcrazy,1 point,Mon May 11 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"Hehe I believe I struck a nerve here /u/Geschichtenerzaehler? I can try to explain a bit :)  Kano jujitsu is actually a well documented term. It was not until 1918 (I believe) that the Kodokan officially ruled that it's name would exclusively be called; Judo, even though Judo was most prominent. If this in fact is filmed in 1912, Judo would many times be referred to as 'Kano Jui-jitsu', especially off-seas, Brazil in this case it appears. There is even a segment about this in the book; History of Judo by Syd Hoare, and the book; Jigoro Kano and the Kodokan by Kano Risei.   One of the reasons, many believe, that BJJ is called Brazilian Jujitsu and not Brazilian Judo, is because demonstrations when Maeda went off-seas often was coined 'Kano jujitsu' in newspapers, because the term 'Judo' was not that known yet, while jujitsu was. This is why I chose to label the topic Kano jujitsu, because that is probably what he was 'teaching' at that time. While literally meaning the same thing, it's just a matter of semantics. I can get back to the matter with references once I return from this work trip, I don't have access to my books right now for proof :)   EDIT: To clarify a bit on your points. I am not the (ignorant) person who uploaded that video labeling it 'BJJ' (blasphemy btw), neither did I say anything about 'Kosen Judo'. That is just comments from ignorant people on facebook. Kosen Judo seems to have absolutely no direct ties to BJJ. Just traditional Judo groundwork. Mitsuyo Maeda was a real person, and he did have ties to Kodokan Judo. If I recall correctly he was even instructed by the Kodokan and Jigoro himself (I read mention of him in the Kodokan book on history), but I have to get back to you about a reference about that. Maeda did not leave the Kodokan on good terms I believe, but he still taught Kodokan Judo, but with his own 'touch' of self-defense applications. He was also a 'show-man', might even been a prize-fighter, traveling through Europe then finally south-america (Brazil). During his Judo demonstrations the Gracie Family adopted it and molded it, into it's own 'style' that favored Groundwork."

Kano sent him and Tsunejiro Tomita to overseas in 1904 to teach judo. They separated ways in 1905 and Maeda travelled and fought a lot -a real lot- and mostly successfully around the world in all sorts of matches, until he stayed in Brazil. He was a direct disciple of Kano and Tomita (Kano's 'first' student) and posthumely promoted to 7th dan.  Kosen Judo didn't become a thing until 1914 I think. Gotta look that up.

Focus on your technique being smooth as possible rather than as fast or as hard as possible. It'll reward you in the long run.   Also, learn your breakfalls and use them. Don't post."

As a beginner, you have a long way to go before becoming a blackbelt but competing and applying the moves through instinct is not only a great rush but provides direct feedback on what can be improved that you may not necessarily see in a slower randori!"

judo,2ta8s1,silvaphysh13,10,Thu Jan 22 12:59:55 2015 UTC,"Uki otoshi - as the first throw in kata, it's meant to show the dynamism and ""gentleness"" of judo against a persistantly forceful opponent  Seoi nage - intended to show the efficacy of judo as self defense  Kata guruma - meant to demonstrate the incorporation of Western grappling techniques (i.e. the ""Fireman's Carry"")  Uki goshi - shows the ""inner circle"" principle of turning into an attack  Harai goshi - gradual but cumulative off-balancing to accomplish a quick and graceful throw  Tsurikomi goshi - meant to show uke defending against what seems to be another harai goshi, to which tori adapts to accomplish the throw  Okuri ashi barai - demonstrates ""syncopation"" in stepping to create kuzushi  Sasae tsurikomi ashi - direct example of ""sen-no-sen"" or continuation of momentum for throwing  Uchi mata - using sen-no-sen in a circular, rather than linear, motion to achieve tsukuri  Tomoe nage - achieving kuzushi through uke's desire to halt motion against them   Ura nage - demonstration of using a sacrifice throw for self defense  Sumi gaeshi - harkens back to the armored grappling of the samurai, ala the koshiki-no-kata  Yoko gake - shows how gradually changing uke's posture across several steps can put them in a highly precarious position  Yoko guruma - tori adapts to a defensive posture after an attempted ura nage  Uki waza - bookends the set, mirroring uki otoshi in it's vastly ""gentle"" approach, in case you forgot what judo means  Bear in mind, these are all the interpretations of myself and my sensei (7 dan), but I think they make sense. We study nage no kata several hours every single week, so at this point I've gone through the whole thing perhaps a hundred times. I'm terribly curious to hear other people's interpretations of the individual techniques!"
judo,2ta8s1,Ryvai,2,Thu Jan 22 14:44:50 2015 UTC,Harai-goshi was developed for the purpose of opponents resisting uki-goshi by stepping around. Tsurikomi-goshi was developed for when uke resists your harai-goshi by leaning backwards to defend it. It's almost like a chain; uki-goshi -> harai-goshi -> tsurikomi-goshi. I can write a more comprehensive response once I get back home for my notes :)

Plus Kano was a big fan of the technique.  Very interesting break down of the intent behind the techniques.
judo,2ta8s1,silvaphysh13,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard things along those lines as well. I once heard Kano's uki goshi described as ""feeling as though a needle is getting poked into your waist, at which point you're already on the ground."" I also think it's a very interesting throw in that it shows how a technique can work in a more ""dynamic"" situation, in this case two people walking straight towards each other, then one attacking."

judo,2t9ovd,brianjester,2,Thu Jan 22 07:39:33 2015 UTC,"Harai goshi and kouchi gari strike me as a very odd choice of throws for a person in their third class.  Harai goshi is a fairly advanced throw that requires knowing your entry footwork and getting the ""feel"" of using just enough hip to load and unbalance your opponent slightly, so that the reap is effective.  If you haven't learned well ukigoshi, ogoshi and koshi guruma, harai goshi will end up being an ineffective kick to the legs.  Kouchigari is generally a very subtle and weak throw that relies on placing uke in just the right spot, and is best used as the second attack of a combination.  The classic beginner throws are more like ukigoshi, ogoshi, osoto otoshi, osoto gari, ippon seoinage and morote gari."
judo,2t9ovd,SVPPB,1 point,Thu Jan 22 13:42:00 2015 UTC,"You're right, they're definitely not beginner throws by any means. However, the throws they went over might have depended on the number of people in class that day, and the variety of ranks present. I know we have days when the instructor knows he needs to go over some more advanced moves with the higher ranking students, and doesn't have as much time to focus on beginner moves. Sometimes he'll have the beginners do some basic moves on their own, but other times he will have them do the more advanced moves with the rest of the class, even if he knows this will be more difficult/not as useful for them at the time."

Maybe you should go speak to your doctor about this and get yourself checked out to make sure you don't have any problems that you're not aware of.  I'm not saying this to make you feel bad or anything, just a bit worried about your health!

judo,2t57yn,Geschichtenerzaehler,7,Wed Jan 21 06:08:01 2015 UTC,Why are sacrifice throws like tani otoshi discouraged?
judo,2t57yn,dzendian,5,Wed Jan 21 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"Taniotoshi is discouraged for beginners for 3 reasons.  1) Safety - This type of throw done at the wrong angle spells disaster for the Uke's knees. An out of shape, stiff, heavier, or spastic beginner will have a high chance injuring somebody. - I had my PCL and MCL torn this way.  2)Becomes the go to - It can be easy to catch other beginners who haven't been exposed to this type of throw before. It becomes an easy win and the only move a person tries, which leads into the last reason.  3) Easily countered - I don't know how many times I have seen kids and adult beginners throw themselves with this throw. Usually what happens is you have some success with the throw and then you start using it all the time and by the end of the match or even half way through you're too tired to do the move properly. Then you start pulling your opponent directly on to you throwing yourself.   However it is a good throw to learn. IMO it encompasses the basics needed to do ""the switch"". Which is a great tool to have against opposite sided opponents if you like to do taiotoshi or uchimata or any hip throw really. Here is a video that shows the concept pretty well. Might not be the best technically for learning but a decent overview of the concept."
judo,2t57yn,judokid78,2,Wed Jan 21 23:07:18 2015 UTC,3) Easily countered    That's odd.  I've only ever used it as a counter to a bad hip throw or a bad ippon seoi nagi.    Is it still bad in this scenario?  I understand the first and second points.  Is it the most dangerous sacrifice throw?  Like as bad as tomoe nagi?
judo,2t57yn,dzendian,5,Wed Jan 21 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"Tomoe Nage is relatively safe, aside from potentially rendering your partner sterile; the similarities between tomoe nage and tani otoshi end at ""sacrifice throw.""   Some people, mainly the heavier weights, will attack tani otoshi directly or in anticipation of a throw making it easy to counter. And yes, you can counter a counter."
judo,2t57yn,judokid78,3,Wed Jan 21 23:35:36 2015 UTC,"Is it bad to use Tani Otoshi as a counter attack and not a direct attack, or do the same bad points apply?  Does your opinion of my opinion of this throw change if I say that I only am interested in this throw as a counter attack and not a direct attack?   aside from potentially rendering your partner sterile   Joking?  I can't tell.  Also, do any of these throws have a place in randori or should I avoid using them altogether?  Edit: what about sukui nage?"
judo,2t57yn,dzendian,3,Thu Jan 22 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was joke.   The 3 bad points apply whether you're doing the counter, attacking directly, or even attacking with a switch, which is a throw I like doing. (I have witnessed one player who had been doing judo for 2 or 3 years, tear 2 separate players' ACLs with the switch. He basically sat down on the leg, which is the common mistake on tani otoshi and why it is so dangerous. Both players tried to step out tearing their ACLs.) Those are just reasons why you wouldn't show beginning students tani otoshi.   That being said, it is definitely a throw worth learning and practicing. It can be an effective counter, but you don't see it as much and most people will just back step out of it. The more effective counter is ura nage, and that's what you see at competitions.   I like tani-otoshi as a switch like in video I posted earlier and this is how the throw is mainly used in competition.   You definitely have to try these throws in rondori if they are throws you want to do. Tomoe nage is a great throw that works well in complimenting many styles. Tani otoshi has it's place too."

judo,2t57yn,dzendian,1 point,Thu Jan 22 07:31:05 2015 UTC,Am I wrong in thinking tani otoshi is way easier to pull on a large opponent than ura nage?
judo,2t57yn,Brian175,3,Thu Jan 22 21:38:01 2015 UTC,"There is a place for all throws except Kani Basami in randori.   I personally only hit Tani Otoshi as a counter. Suki Nage will not work in IJF competition because it focuses on grabbing the legs. However, there are ways to effectively set it up and hit it, and if you can it can be a brutal throw."

Today I learned I'm (possibly) a lurker.  Sensei often talks about kuzushi and the kuzushi that uke naturally gives you from mis-stepping and such.  I consider myself aligned with this.  I'm having trouble making the distinction.  Am I a lurker?   About the risk of injury: Watch this video, look closely about 5 seconds in. Tori almost destroys his uke's knee:   Is that because he made uke fall in a way the knee doesn't bend?  I thought the throw was more behind and less awkward-bendy than the 5-seconds in one?"

This is not what I mean by being a lurker, that's actually good judo, or at least half of it. What I mean by lurking is people who do not attack themselves at all, but wait to counter with ""cheap shots"" like tani otoshi or ura nage when the opponent turns for a throw and remain defensive otherwise.  One should try to attack a lot in randori and not being afraid of being countered. One should also learn to provoke mis-steps from uke actively. In other words practice a proper offense."

Fix your eyes on something as far away as possible. The dizziness should be over a lot quicker."

judo,2t57yn,ckristiantyler,4,Wed Jan 21 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"Generally people will tell you to stick to one side, but I think it is a good idea to try things on both sides when you're still learning and then decide later. Like in your example your righty so you have learned things righty, but maybe a lefty stance is more natural to you. You would never be able to discover that if you don't try.   However it is usually a bad idea to switch sides during a match. You will see people do it for gripping but that's about it. You become vulnerable once you switch sides and generally will only be threat on one side. For example if we are fighting and I know your move is a right handed taiotoshi, once you start fighting lefty I am no longer worried about the throw. That frees me up to attack you more, which is great because I love shooting Uchimata a lefty stance.   In the mean time keep trying both sides until you can decide which side is most comfortable."
judo,2t57yn,ChrisDotNisbet,2,Wed Jan 21 20:02:44 2015 UTC,I am a righty and fight both ways. My favorite throw is left side Seoi Nage with a righty grip. Lately I have also been working left side O Goshi with right hand lapel grip. But i also hit a righty Harai Goshi. Find out what you like and how you like to throw. I learned to throw Seoi Nage from 7 different grips so it is always available should I want to use it.

judo,2t57yn,antsonmyscreen,1 point,Thu Jan 22 12:53:19 2015 UTC,"When going into randori, I try not to think too much about what technique I will apply and on what side, instead I try to go with the opportunities that present themselves (or opportunities I could provoke). Since I practice throws on both sides, I have more options and thus had some success applying them on both sides. Aiming for flexibility is aiming for good judo imho.  Flexibility aside, it's also important to practice techniques no both sides  for even muscle development."
judo,2t57yn,antsonmyscreen,6,Thu Jan 22 06:14:19 2015 UTC,I have my first tournament this weekend and I'm getting quite nervous. Any advice for a judoka's first tournament?
judo,2t57yn,Botenmango,6,Wed Jan 21 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"first tournaments are all about confidence! go out there and do your thing, it'll be fun. above all, make sure you try your hardest and don't leave anything up to the ref. there's no worse feeling than ""I totally could have had that guy."""
judo,2t57yn,ckristiantyler,2,Wed Jan 21 19:39:14 2015 UTC,Thank you for your advice and response! Is there any competition etiquette that I should know about?  Edit: Better words
judo,2t57yn,antsonmyscreen,3,Wed Jan 21 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"yeah, etiquette wise, bow onto the mat, bow onto the actual competition area and wear your shoes or slippers when you're off the mat. the refs will correct you if you mess anything up, don't worry so much!"

judo,2t57yn,ChrisDotNisbet,2,Thu Jan 22 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"Welp, what you described is somewhat what happened in my last match. I didn't realize it but my senseis said I had been in control of most of the match and out of nowhere it seemed to just disappear (at the time, I wasn't sure what the hell was going on).   I ended up having 4 matches in a division with 6 other women (I was women's novice 160lb).  My first match was just plain embarrassing. It was like I forgot everything related to Judo and was thrown almost immediately (and very softly, no force, it was so embarrassing, it was like she didn't expect it to work either).   My second match was the exact opposite, I became spazzy and burned through my energy. I ended up winning that match because she went for my legs.  My third match, I threw her and she landed on her side and turtled. I turned her over and pinned her.   The fourth match seemed to go on forever and towards the end she threw me and pinned me.   All in all, I did a mixture of lots of negatives and some positive things and am still processing everything. I ended up placing 3rd in my division which was surprising.   Aside from my embarrassment, tournaments are fun and this was a great first exposure for me. I made new friends and got those first time jitters (hopefully) mostly out of my system."

I didn't really understand where I was supposed to be, and when.  I was very TENSE and TIGHT and got totally spanked.  I lost all my matches that competition.  I felt very sore that night, most likely due to the TENSE/TIGHT nature that I was exuding.  I barely remember my first match.  Good luck.  Try not to be like me (tense, tight, and nervy).

I think it was IJ-something (which was USJ-something affiliated).  I attended Indiana University, Bloomington, and took the beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes, as well as attended judo club there.  I competed in the Gnawbone judo competition.  Honestly, I can't remember where else I competed, but it was around Southern Indiana.  My direct sensei was Vern Ellett.  His sensei was John Hampton.  I'm not about to pull my transcripts to prove this shit to you.    Why do you even care?    I was ranked a yellow belt at the time I left college... many many years ago.  Now I'm gladly wearing a white belt at my new dojo in Los Angeles.  Are these ""mcdojo""'s?  I don't know.  Am I trying to collect belts?  Absolutely not.  I'm trying to learn judo as best I can, mainly from a strategy level.  Other than asking about the insane workout we did on Monday, my only other ping was to the /r/judo about what to do about ""back to judo"" pain, and I got good responses.  If I need someone to tell me to ""man up"", I'll ping you directly, since that's all you're good for.

judo,2t57yn,HermitOnAJourney,6,Wed Jan 21 08:40:36 2015 UTC,"Beginners in judo start with a white belt, there's usually no exam for it. Later belts are usually earned by succeeding in an exam.  You don't have to take exams of course, but after a few years it would be a bit weird if you just remained a whitebelt. It's rather discouraging for newbies if another whitebelt is much more advanced than them."

judo,2t57yn,BenanaFofana,3,Wed Jan 21 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"Anybody here know of Goh Hinogami from Virtua Fighter? Are his depiction of Judo throws accurate?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzqC7pNGToY  Throws start at 2:03 Attack-Throws: 1:46, 1:53"
judo,2t57yn,UnoriginalG,6,Thu Jan 22 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"I fell down the rabbit-hole here.  Tl;dr: Some of these are real Judo throws, and they're reasonably accurate. The names are a mixed bag.  1:43: Deashi bara is an actual Judo foot sweep.  1:45: Murakumo is definitely not a Judo throw, but the armlock he ends it with is juji gatame.  1:54: I saw something like the Ni'ousatsu in classical Jujutsu, but it's not in Judo. He ends the technique in something resembling a classical Jujutsu pin.  2:03: Makikomi is a real Judo throw. Technically that one is a soto (outside) makikomi.  2:08: Uchimata is a real--and very popular--Judo throw.  2:16: Oguruma is a real Judo throw.  2:20: I don't recognize the name ""Tsuchigumo"" but it looks like a double-leg takedown, known in Judo as morote gari.  2:24: Ganseki otoshi is a more obscure Judo throw, pulling on the opponent's lapels.  2:27: Naraku otoshi isn't a Judo technique. Judo trips put more emphasis on controlling the opponent's upper body.  2:32: Tachidori is an armlock-takedown from Aikido.  2:43: Gourai looks like a variant of our shoulder throw, seoi nage, although applied with an elbow-break.  2:47: The armlock part of Hiji'ate Kuchiki'ori looks sort of like our waki gatame armlock, although the entry is very un-Judo-like.  2:53: Kegon otoshi is definitely not Judo.  3:04: ""Orochi"" uses the guard position from Judo and BJJ, and ends with the ""guillotine"" neck crank that is illegal in Judo but used in BJJ.  3:22: The term ""kuzushi"" used here is a fundamental Judo concept, referring to breaking an opponent's balance/posture to prepare to throw them.  3:27: Osoto gari is a real Judo throw, and looks more or less like he does it here.  3:32: Osoto guruma is a real Judo throw, but it doesn't involve kicking the legs out one at a time like he does. It looks more like this, like an osoto gari that attacks both legs instead of just one.  3:36: Seoi otoshi is a real Judo throw. It looks like that, although his foot position is questionable.  3:41: Okuri ashi barai and ashi barai are Judo trips, and they look close to that.  3:55: Tama nage should be ""tama guruma,"" another obscure Judo throw invented by Kyozo Mifune.  3:58: Osoto otoshi is a real Judo throw.  4:05: Yasha guruma looks like a variant of tomoe nage. He finishes with a Judo-style cross-collar choke (which may be a bit silly if his opponent isn't wearing a jacket).  4:30: Hiza guruma is another Judo throw that works pretty much like he does it.  5:30: This seems like a good place to point out that Judo does not train leg or ankle-locks.  5:36: Kesa gatame is a real Judo pin.  5:43: ""Ude hishigi"" means ""arm-breaking."" The technique shown here is known as juji gatame. (Ude-hishigi juji gatame if you want to be pedantic, but the first part is almost always dropped.) Goh should scoot his butt forward to get his hips under the opponent's elbow.  5:50: ""Murasame"" looks like it might be Judo's ude garame armlock, although it's hard to tell.  5:59: ""Ha'origatame"" might be waki gatame. Again, it's hard to tell.  As a final note, Goh should tuck his gi jacket in."

Lol, I think he's supposed to be the antithesis of the prim and proper main character, Akira (who looks like a Ryu clone), hence the tucked out Gi.

This particular dojo has absolutely no focus on competition Judo though, you can still easily compete in Judo or grappling tournaments and people from our club tend to do well.

So I'd say go for one of those. You're wasting your time with TKD etc if you want self defence. Out of what you've listed, judo is the most well rounded for self defence other than MMA or combat sambo but both have head strikes.   As for injuries, you're going to have to expect those in any combat sport but you just need to learn to train smart.   I've also heard great things about tokhan and I'm not even from he US."

judo,2t48y1,magewater,0,Sun Jan 25 10:09:34 2015 UTC,"Judo is great and can be used for self-Defense however it's not train as one. It's more of a sport since it doesn't cover strikes and has rules that could limit it for fighting. It's not like MMA where they cover everything in terms of strikes,takedowns & groundwork or BJJ in a self-defense form (It does cover strikes & taking your opponent down). Judo however will make you hard to takedown & a good throw can end a fight. There are pros/cons to alot of styles such as 3-5 people jumping you or a weapon. It's a fun hard sport. Answer to 1 & 2  Judo you can get hurt or land on your head so that's common however any combat sport will get hurt at some point. Just like any other sport out there answer 3"
judo,2t48y1,Anthony126517,3,Wed Jan 21 09:37:20 2015 UTC,"MMA is still a sport, and therefore still has rules. For example, you can't stomp on your opponent's head, but in a self defense situation you might find your attacker trying to do exactly that.  The point is that combat sports like judo, BJJ, MMA, are in many ways better for self defense than something that explicitly focuses on self defense. The reason for this is that the combat sports allow full speed sparring in training, so you get used to executing your techniques against a resisting opponent. Conversely, while a self defense class might teach you how to wrist lock an attacker, it's very unlikely to let you practise your wrist locks on a resisting partner.   So I think a combat sport on balance is better than a self defense class. The training with resisting partners outweighs the somewhat unrealistic rule set that comes with whatever sport you're training in."

Solo practice can be very valuable once you've got some good knowledge under your belt or are trying to correct something specific: you can't just stop a class to go over a variation on (insert throw here) fifty or sixty times, do an extra half-hour of technical randori, or work through different entries into a technique/counter with a resisting opponent.  When your basics are new or weak, however, more than anything you'll end up burning in bad habits that might otherwise have been corrected early.  If you're still at the stage where you're trying to solidify standard throws (not combinations/variations/counters), practicing without a more experienced person around will probably hurt more than help.  Also, unless you're using something like a sand pit (not advocating it, just an example), even soft throws are a bad idea without protection.  Most people can do ukemi on hard/semi-hard surfaces with a bit of practice, but it's still rough on the body and a single mistake can lead to a serious injury rather than just the bruise you'd get on tatami."
judo,2svn3g,carasci,3,Mon Jan 19 01:56:53 2015 UTC,"I would not do it.  Yes, it's the blind leading the blind, etc.  If you actually do do it because you're irrationally fixed on doing judo in a basement with someone who also doesn't know what they're doing and is as equally irrational as you, I would not do throws.  I would practice very basic ne waza pins, e.g., kesa gatame.  And even then very lightly.  Just pins and trying (lightly!) to get out of them, nothing else (i.e., nothing that can lead to injury/death).  This would be the least risky (and not entirely risk free) thing you can do on your own, given those conditions."

Honestly, to me, it sounds so McDojo and dubious. Even Kano is not to referred to as master but Kano shihan. Even though the words may have the same meaning, since judo uses japanese as its universal language, I think its appropriate to refrain from using the, imo tainted english version.   I think it's just more appropriate to just refer to him as Kashiwazaki sensei or sensei Kashiwazaki.  However referring to him descriptively rather than formally, as newaza master Kashiwazaki is totally cool.   (pedant rant mode off)  Anyway, again, great link."
judo,2soy7l,ckristiantyler,24,Sat Jan 17 01:40:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like I'm missing out on something important for not having learned judo back before wrist and ankle locks were banned in 1899. Or before knee and shoulder locks were banned and newaza time was drastically restricted in 1925. Or before the 70s when the rules awarded ippon for lifting an opponent on their back to the height of your shoulders. Or before 1984, when kani basami was allowed...or before the 1950s when there was no time limit, or before the 1970s before the time limit was twenty full minutes. I'm missing out on something for not having trained before 1974, when bad throws were recognized by yuko and koka and penalties were introduced. I'm missing out for not having trained before 1964, when the openweight ideal was abandoned. I'm missing out for not having trained before the 80s, when gripping restrictions were put into place to artificially overemphasize the 'standard' collar-and-sleeve grip and destroy the value of novel gripping techniques employed by Eastern Bloc judoka. I'm missing out for not having trained in the days when the phrase 'atemi-waza' provoked something other than puzzlement, sighs, or concealed snickers in a judo dojo.  I'm missing out for not having trained in the period where the cross-training ethos in judo was so strong that judoka actually sought out Western wrestlers to learn their shit.   It is, frankly, kind of crazy to want to train the kind of openweight, few-holds-barred, no-time-limit, cross-training, hard-fighting judo that I sometimes dream of- a judo only half-tame, scarcely removed from its roots as the fighting art of a class of crazy sunsobitches who needed a word for testing out a new sword by killing a random passerby, a judo sometimes bordering on the sadistic in its elevation of fighting spirit over sanity, a judo that served Imperial Japan by transforming many young men into strong, fierce, obedient and patriotically conformist soldiers.  But there's got to be a better middle ground than the current damned mess!"
judo,2soy7l,Toptomcat,2,Sat Jan 17 06:40:17 2015 UTC,"Tsujigiri:       Tsujigiri (辻斬り or 辻斬 tsuji-giri, literally 'crossroads killing') is a Japanese term for a practice when a samurai, after receiving a new katana or developing a new fighting style or weapon, tests its effectiveness by attacking a human opponent, usually a random defenseless passer-by, in many cases during nighttime.  The practitioners themselves are also referred to as tsujigiri.   In the medieval era, the term referred to traditional duels between bushi, but in the Sengoku period (1467-1600), widespread anarchy caused it to degrade into indiscriminate murder, permitted by the unchecked power of the bushi. Shortly after order was restored, the Edo government prohibited the practice in 1602. Offenders would receive capital punishment.  The only actual incident where a very large number of people were indiscriminately killed in the Edo period was the 1696 Yoshihara spree killing (吉原百人斬), where a wealthy lord named Yoshihara had a psychotic fit and murdered dozens of prostitutes with a katana. He was treated by authorities as a spree killer and sentenced to death. Later, a kabuki play was made about the incident.

judo,2soy7l,autowikibot,2,Sat Jan 17 06:40:48 2015 UTC,Is it possible to find a dojo that still teaches everything that has been removed since judo's inception?
judo,2soy7l,ldzman218,3,Sat Jan 17 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"You get the occasional club that trains with leg grabs and shoulder locks, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a club that practices judo as it was originally practiced.   Nowadays you can get all the ne-waza techniques (and more) from Brazilian jiu-jitsu, but our nage-waza is really weak, which is why many jiujiteiros cross-train in judo (myself included). Sambo has a lot of the old nage-waza techniques (and more), and their ne-waza isn't half bad either, but it's more limited than BJJ's (though less limited than judo's). I should think that by training in both, you would develop a skill set similar to those original judoka.   It's sad that two arts that branched off from judo and hybridized with other arts (BJJ with luta livre, Sambo with wrestling) have preserved more of judo's spirit than judo itself."
judo,2soy7l,bear-knuckle,2,Sat Jan 17 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"Sambo is much closer: leg throws, leg submissions, fewer gripping restrictions, time limit is usually equivalent to or longer than judo depending on precise ruleset, more newaza time, kani basami allowed, cross-training encouraged, striking allowed in combat sambo. Sport sambo doesn't permit chokes or strikes: combat sambo does.  There is some stuff that's been removed since judo's founding that I'm glad to be rid of. There was a great deal of mystical nonsense going around in the 1880-1920 period, urban-legend stuff about aiki and kiai left over from the various schools of classical jujutsu. See pages 111-141 of this book from 1913, written by the first Westerner to achieve shodan rank in Judo. It's mostly either been forgotten or migrated into aikido, and good riddance."

judo,2soy7l,the_mighty_j,8,Sat Jan 17 08:45:57 2015 UTC,"I would like to start out by saying that I started Judo in the late 90's well before the ban on leg grabs. In the terms of your self-defense and all-around martial capabilities you are indeed missing out on something. However, you also missed out on the great BJJ influx of the early 2000's that led to the ban. At the highest levels of judo it wasn't a massive detriment, but on the local and state level it was a plague. People using takedowns and sloppy groundwork to draw out and stall matches was not the exception, but the norm. I recall several tournaments where there might have been one or two ippon wins all day. The rest were not only bad representations of the sport, but just plain boring to watch. I DO NOT like the ban on leg grabs and such, but you would have to be crazy to think it wasn't necessary for the sport.   On a side note, we separate our schedule between tournament season and promotion season, and let our senior judoka (brown and up) train and randori with leg grabs and submissions during non tournament times."
judo,2soy7l,bushikris,5,Sun Jan 18 05:54:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I've been doing judo for 12 years now (long enough to have experienced both rule sets) and I feel that the sport is getting devalued as a result of the rule changes. If techniques were seen to be a bit ""cheap"" - which was a fairly common opinion of leg grabs where I train - then defences against them were drilled, rather than new rules being made up to ban techniques. Another issue with new rules is the ""no touching below the belt"" rule. I've seen people disqualified in competitions for an Urunagi which was gripped slightly below the belt, and others scoring for ones which landed slightly above the belt. It seems silly to me that a few inches significantly changes the validity of one person's ability to throw another. Just my two cents on the matter."

It all feels so silly.  I KNOW the Olympics are important, but I'm a white belt at 28. I'll never, ever make it there.  I want to learn the martial art, not the sport. (My club doesn't have much of a recreation/art focus anymore because membership is just too low nowadays, and grants require competitive students.)

Your opponent acted within the rules, and won: you broke the rules, and lost by disqualification. He's the better man, get over it.  If you view judo shiai as training for the use of judo in the context of self-defense, it's the only sensible attitude to have. Your opponent displayed skills that would get him killed in practice: you displayed skills that would permit you to survive. That the rules do not properly reward the difference between your skills and those of your opponent is a problem with the rules, not you.  It is reasonable to have either outlook on judo shiai. To some extent, judo's competition rules and its teaching in the dojo must reflect a compromise between the two.

judo,2slf92,mmhg,6,Fri Jan 16 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"You don't see a ton of battling between heads - that's more of a wrestling thing - but if someone does get that close, you definitely want a dominant head position. That means the top of your head underneath their jaw or pressed against their temple.  But he probably meant to keep your chin tucked during your breakfalls."

judo,2slf92,cascadecombo,2,Fri Jan 16 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"No, ukemi isn't an escape. It was because back when they trained on hard floors you didn't get koed or killed if you did ukemi."
judo,2slf92,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Mon Jan 19 16:44:36 2015 UTC,"Death or a knockout was also the goal of many throws, and ukemi is meant to save your life in that situation. It's also taught as a response to wristlocks in aikido, classical jujutsu, and (see above) hapkido. You can argue that it's not an effective escape, but not that it isn't considered one."
judo,2slf92,flowgod,5,Mon Jan 19 22:18:40 2015 UTC,"I have the impression that hapkido training isn't focused on sparring. Judo is.

judo,2sdi0x,Bluurgh,3,Wed Jan 14 10:20:53 2015 UTC,"Keep your posture, raise you head and don't lean forward (they will pull you down and control you for an easy sweep). Don't stretch out your hands, like the classic grabbing their neck with a straight arm (hello armbar!). Be careful with grips high on their collar while inside their guard. Push down on their stomach while grabbing the belt or both lapels put together, this will control their hip mobility and protect your posture.  Put your knee right under the buttocks, while grabbing the belt or both lapels (together), while pushing down, and try to pry open their legs without exposing yourself too much.  Never attempt any juji-jime (cross-chokes) while inside their guard, unless you are vastly more technical than they are, which is unlikely if they practice BJJ."

judo,2sdi0x,M3atboy,2,Wed Jan 14 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"Can you recall how you tend to get swept? Is there one or two sweeps they're hitting on you consistently? If so, there is probably something you're doing that is giving up the sweep. I'd ask your partner after the spar.  Otherwise, your base in guard is probably just bad.  Keep your weight back on your heels and your head and eyes up, the ""ideal"" base is with your back straight and your eyes centered on the horizon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j7KVxYz8hk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so2f48pDuEY These are two good, high percentage passes which compliment each other"
judo,2sdi0x,War_Daddy,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:55:07 2015 UTC,I'm a BJJ Blue a good guard pass is a standing pass. However in Judo (Club I train at) if you stand up newaze they stand you up.For some reason in Judo they don't train stand up & Groundwork as one but as two. If you stand up its stand up time & if you have matwork it's only that. I never see standing passes (one guy standing other guy on the ground) It's abit strange at first. I recommend you just YouTube some BJJ guard breaks or drop-in at a bjj school
judo,2sdi0x,Anthony126517,2,Wed Jan 14 11:15:01 2015 UTC,I am fairly certain that during shia standing up for any length of time during newaza will get you both stood up.
judo,2sdi0x,M3atboy,-1,Wed Jan 14 13:50:26 2015 UTC,"I've seen a youtube video of a BJJ match, where a standing guard pass results in a broken spine for the bottom fighter.   Now I accept that this is a very rare occurrence. But given how dangerous back injuries are, I don't think encouraging beginners of either judo or BJJ to try standing passes is a smart idea."

judo,2sdi0x,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:59:32 2015 UTC,"As soon as they open their guard grab their legs and control them.   You have a number of options from there.   1) get your weight on one of their legs and bring your knee over it. This works because it's painful as hell and they can't get their foot in a position to sweep.   2) lock your hands underneath and bring their legs together then shift your weight to the side whilst leading with your shoulder and slide past their legs.   3) stack their weight on them and lock their legs up tight and move past.   4) bait the triangle and pass on that side (very risky though if you do it wrong)  I learned these passes in judo and they work on purple belts in BJJ class.   Obviously they don't work 100% of the time but if you get good at a couple of them then it gives you options to work.   Two important things in newaza are to keep your base strong and your weight on them, and also to keep your arms bent unless you have their legs controlled or you're asking for a sankaku or juji gatame.   I'll edit this post when I'm on a desktop with links."
judo,2sdi0x,Spooky-Forest,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:00:35 2015 UTC,"Youtube, more newaza practice, and help from your instructors are your greatest friends here.  Youtube: Find some BJJ stuff that isn't too complicated to start off on. Hopefully you have some newaza basics that judo has taught you, and you don't need to build up from nothing.  Newaza practice: Try to spend time drilling newaza techniques/systems in class, whether its newaza uchikomi, or just trying to work new techniques in during randori.  Instructors: Ask for their help, they are there to help. Not all instructors will be able to help you, but even if they aren't groundwork specialists, they can probably give you some pointers when you show them something."
judo,2sdi0x,M3atboy,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:18:09 2015 UTC,"Don't have any links but a good tip is to not play into their guard, that is don't lean over their body and try to attack, sit back on your heels and get out of their legs.   2 passes I've used ( don't know their names) the first you grab their belt from the front in both hands then push down on the inside of their legs with your elbows. Bring one knee through to apply additional pressure to one of the legs, push down hard, bring your other leg through.  The second only works if they aren't actively gripping your top. You sit back on your heels, scoot away from them and grab one of their ankles. Scooting back as far as you can straighten their leg. One straight pass the foot in front of your body and shoot in for control."
judo,2sdi0x,DoorsofPerceptron,3,Wed Jan 14 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"I listed this as a bad example in my video collection:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0vig-MjIz8  Just to kick off a little discussion here, who can say what's wrong with it?"
judo,2sdi0x,Spooky-Forest,6,Wed Jan 14 06:29:08 2015 UTC,"Probably the least objectionable part of that is Uke wearing shoes on the mat. It's all downhill after that.   Kuzushi - you keep saying that word, I do not think it means what you think it means. The first time he actually tried to demonstrate this(around 25 seconds), he buckled his spine and pulled himself into Uke instead of unbalancing Uke. He never gets Uke on his toes.  Then he never drops his hips under Uke. Actually it's funnier than this, at one point  his hips drop as he steps in to throw, and then he straightens up before making body contact.  Then there is everything else (mostly stances and footwork), but if I was coaching I'd fix the unbalancing and the hip placement first."
judo,2sdi0x,Ryvai,6,Wed Jan 14 10:14:57 2015 UTC,"He takes an unnecessary extra step with his leading foot at the end of his entry almost every time - it's a demo with a willing uke....   He's also loading most of the weight onto his right leg, straightening it out most of the time, whereas his left leg is usually slightly bent.  Kuzushi is not being used, and the demonstrations of it are barely metaphorical nods to it.  He seems to enjoy performing tiny lifts of uke before finishing his throws. It's very ""stop and go"" throwing. The throws look like they could be workouts  Uke's body is almost on his feet after.  His posture continues to be bent after performing a throw.  On an instructional note, being less picky about how his technique is flawed:   He doesn't mention dropping hips or centre of gravity at all during this video. Kuzushi explanation is skipped, and the lack of visible kuzushi doesn't help. He gives no good instructions on footwork to enter into the throw; he basically says "" turn, go inside and make your feet parallel.""  There is very little breakdown of any key part of the technique."

judo,2sdi0x,porl,3,Wed Jan 14 14:28:42 2015 UTC,General lack of any kind of mechanics that make a hip throw work.  He seems to only use his upper body to twist uke over. This only works because of the size difference and the fact that uke isn't resisting. trying to do this with a same sized resisting opponent is how you injure yourself.

judo,2sdi0x,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Thu Jan 15 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"Don't just try to pull an unwilling uke to you with your strength. This will almost never work in randori. Instead make him move by himself where you want him. Ideally add his strength to yours. You could try the following setups:   For a right sided throw, try to drive uke's left foot back by attacking with o uchi gari. Use his defensive reaction to attack with harai goshi. Walk backwards without strong pulling, just lure him into stepping forward. When you opponent steps forward on his own, exaggerate his movement and nail his weight on his leading foot. Use an underhook to push them or an overhook to drag them sideways onto their right foot."
judo,2sdi0x,silvaphysh13,1 point,Thu Jan 15 06:25:34 2015 UTC,"Try looking up combinations of throws to get the reaction you want. There are all sorts of combination setups under the sun; Youtube is a great source of help here.  Or you can attempt to grip fight for dominant grips, but that's going to be tougher in the long run- and you might get countered or thrown because you are focusing on gripfighting too much."
judo,2sdi0x,monkeycycling,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:21:53 2015 UTC,"Are you lifting your arms high enough? The elbow on your sleeve arm should be pointing up at at least a 45% angle, and you should be looking at the back of your wrist which is placed directly in front of your face as you pull.  If you pull down, the person you're fighting can easily pull back, but if you pull up, they have to come forward.  Maybe your arms are too week, but I've been slammed round by tiny Japanese girls, so it's probably your technique that needs improvement."
judo,2sdi0x,Spooky-Forest,1 point,Thu Jan 15 09:31:28 2015 UTC,"Something I've found to be useful is to off-balance with your feet first, your hips second, and your shoulders last, without worrying much at all about your hands/arms. This means that your timing and tsukuri are critical. One way I often achieve this for hip throws is to use lots of tai sabaki stepping to try to get a ""putting on a backpack"" motion, where they step out and around, and you twist into the center. It helps basically load them onto your hip, and your arms ideally do very little lifting until kake happens."
judo,2sdi0x,Spooky-Forest,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"Say you go for taiotoshi and you don't trap the foot and they get around, but as they're coming back to the mats the pull is so strong they fall to their back and slap. At this point they're not under you,  could be a foot or two away and you may lose a sleeve or both. So distance and weak or no grip,  is that still an ippon? If not is it worth anything in a competition?"

So, practice, practice, practice.  When resting between randoris, make a conscious effort to get your breathing under control: in through the nostrils, out through the mouth, and pay attention to your diaphram (pretend your breath is filling up a small beachball in your stomach, by working your muscles so you expand the stomach, not raise your shoulders/upper chest).  It won't be natural or second nature for a while, but that will be part of your martial arts practice."

judo,2sajkd,chengjih,2,Wed Jan 14 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"Exhale when executing, and exhale when getting thrown.  Try to breathe at a ""normal"" rate, rather than ""fast"" in general, but your exhalations should be sharp on execution/ukemi, i.e., kiai as ryvai noted."
judo,2sajkd,Ryvai,3,Wed Jan 14 11:31:14 2015 UTC,"For throws, especially in randori, I usually let go a subtle 'kiai'. I'm not yelling or anything, it's more of a forceful exhale.

The concept has become a notable part of Asian martial arts in popular culture, especially in martial arts films, in writing rendered in variants such as Hi-yah!, Aiyah!, Eeee-yah!, or Hyah!.  The term is a compound of ki (気) meaning energy or mood, a(u)(合), an emphatic marker.  The same concept is known as K'ihap in many Korean martial arts, such as taekwondo, hap being the, based on the Korean reading of the same characters; its Hangul spelling is 기합.

judo,2sajkd,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Tue Jan 13 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"Whatever you are doing as a judoka, be it randori, ukemi practice or uchi komi, you have to master the appropriate use of tenseness and loseness.  Part of creating sudden tensenes is proper exhalation. Phases of loseness allow you to keep or regain your wind.  For a throw the first movements while you position yourself should be light (and accompanied by very quick breaths), you only really tense up the moment you begin the actual throw: exhale all the way through it.  For ukemi to the side and to the back, exhale before you hit the ground. Ideally continue to exhale until you have hit it and can release the body tension afterwards. For rolling ukemi, exhale synchronous with the rolling movement.  While you are on the move, be it attacking or evading, stay lose and keep a steady breathing rhythm. Remain relaxed for the most time, be it standing or on the ground. Only tense up in those moments when you need it, exhale synchronous.  Inbetween or after exercises or during breaks in a randori, you can try to regain your breath by taking deep breaths. You can support this by pulling your shoulders back or lifting your arms while extending your chest as much as possible."
judo,2sajkd,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"For throwing it's more a case of the Noel Coward advice:  ""Just speak your lines and try not to trip over the furniture.""   The actual throw is just a fraction of a second, so for shortness of breath it doesn't matter what you do. The problem is you're not breathing normally before the throw. When you're not throwing, then it doesn't matter how you breathe, so don't overthink it - just make sure you're breathing.  The same holds for being thrown, make sure you're breathing however you like when you're not in the air. But just before you land, you should exhale a little in a short sharp breath. It stops you getting winded."
judo,2sajkd,staticfocus,1 point,Tue Jan 13 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"I use a very similar technique as Ryvai. During uchikomi's and randori I breath normally until I am executing a throw or being thrown, at which point I exhale louder/firmer as I throw or as I fall. Eventually you will get used to it and you won't know how to not do it."
judo,2sajkd,acn9,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:56:45 2015 UTC,There are no shortcuts in my experience. Just keep practicing and your body will get used to it.
judo,2sajkd,ahapkidoin,1 point,Wed Jan 14 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"We pay an incredible amount of detail attention to our breathing in Hapkido, so I felt it might be ok if I chimed in here for a moment.  The general rule is to try to exhale when you're executing a movement with great power, i.e. when you're about to explosively strike, pull, push, or shift, including when you're landing. Exhaling on execution increases your power delivery, and exhaling on impacting a fall decreases the chance you'll get the wind knocked out of you."

While you do this roll your head forward and back side to side and then circular motion. After some strength is added lose the hands and just do this with your head and feet  Try doing a hand stand using your hands and head.

judo,2s0u23,Derparony,4,Sun Jan 11 04:50:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's not such a big deal but I have a grappling background where it is regarded as normal to apply neck cranks and head locks. When i play judo I won't try to submit someone with a headlock or by hurting their neck in any way but I will try to control them by holding the head/neck. If this hurts the person they should just ask me to ease up on it and I will. I don't see the difference between holding the head in a head lock or holding it in kesa gatame. Actually, Josh Barnett submitted Dean Lister with a variation of the kesa gatame, so there's that. Just speak up to your sparring partners and train your neck a little bit so it won't hurt any more."

Is he pushing your head towards your chest? Or perhaps using his shoulder to push your head to one side? or putting his shoulder underneath your chin?
judo,2s0u23,Jadonblade,1 point,Sun Jan 11 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, sometimes in shiai when a choke is just 80% in place, I take the chances and just choke with more force which essentially makes it a headlock. But in training that shouldn't be the case at any time.  Neck strength is sill a good thing to have in Judo, my favourite exercise for this is:  Lie on the back and lift your head slightly (~1cm) with your eyes towards the ceiling. Now look 20-30 times to your rightand back up, then 20-30 times to our right.At last bring your chin to your chest 20-30 times. For the last repetitions it is important that you do not use more than your neck muscles to lift your head, so avoid anything that feels the slightest bit like doing crunches."

I mainly used head-to-head pressure either with the temple or chin on the forehead. By rules this would still be forbidden, but it is impossible for referees to recognize how much force is actually applied to the head. Nowadays I wouldn't do it anymore (I go for the juji-gatame anyways all the time)."
judo,2s0u23,Hippocampus88,0,Mon Jan 12 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"I won a wrestling match by headlock once.  It was regionals, the guy was seeded waaay higher than me (and was just plain better than me) so when I found myself in that position, I squeezed the hell out of that hold.  You're not allowed to choke in wrestling so the ref kept telling me to loosen it up.  I'd let up a bit and then cruuuuuush it down again.  The guy held on for a while so I went to a different type of headlock, which I've only ever heard referred to as a ""keefer"", because I didn't want to run out of time (and then proceed to get my ass kicked.)  Say I have my right arm around his head in kesa.  I lock my right hand on my left bicep and then turn my body face down and squeeeeeeeeeeze.  It's a really painful neck crush (not that I had the experience to know this at the time, keep in mind.)  He went limp and gave up the pin and they took him to the hospital.  (It wasn't anything serious, just soreness.  I saw him at the venue on day two where, incidentally, I had a shitty weight cut and lost miserably.)  If it was a submission match I have very little doubt that I'd have gotten the tap."

judo,2s0bc9,DiminutiveGiraffe,3,Sat Jan 10 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"Two tips relayed on to me:  Remember to breathe. Breath control and meditation make a huge difference to reducing anxiety before competition. Helped me a lot.  Visualise. Go through your techniques in your head. Thinking about them before hand will prime your reactions and muscles for responding quickly in the fight.  I also recommend reading the Hagakure, a Bushido text. A lot of it is... weird, and I by no means wholly endorse it. It has some useful tips for mental preparation though. Best recommendation is clearly dividing and balancing your thinking into wanting to win (aspiration), preparation against defeat, and accepting defeat. Sometimes, no matter how strong you are, how well prepared you are, you will lose. Much as pumping your tires is a good idea, it also makes losses harder to recover from over the course of a tournament, and temporary setbacks become fatal distractions. If you have already defeated yourself a hundred times before the match begins defeat stops mattering and you can throw yourself into the match entirely. Only accepting defeat is not productive, but including it as part of a balance helps to reduce the anxiety and surprise of setbacks."
judo,2s0bc9,AnthraxCat,3,Sun Jan 11 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"Randori, randori, randori.   Nothing gets you prepared for competing more than randori, visit different clubs and compete with people you don't know.   Chances are, if you don't compete a lot, you'll still get jitters and tense up but if you compete regularly then that goes away to an extent as well.   Whilst JJJ isn't as competitive as some other combat sports, I'm sure you do something similar on occasion."

Or do you mean some other Ju Jutsu style?  Okay, style aside, doing lot's of randori is one key to the proper mindset. Another thing is recognizing the mindset that helps you most in a fight. Some people go well with some sort of aggression/anger (not the best choice imho), others prefer to be totally calm yet others prefer a confident or concentrated mindset. Once you've found your prefered fighting mindset, you should find your easiest way to slip into it.  Aggression and anger are easy to get into, just think of the people you like least or some injustice that grinds your gears. Again this is not the best competition mindset, but it helps overcoming your fear. Yasuhiro Yamashita thought along the lines:""I imagined, that my opponent had just killed my father"".  For calming down and concentrating deep breathing and letting go of troubling thoughts is the best way. Just focus on breathing for a while.  Confidence relies on lots of practice, but also on thinking along the lines of ""look, this is how it's done"" and ""I cannot fail"". This may be some sort of self-deception and I'd refrain from uttering such thoughts before the fight, but putting yourself silently there, may help you concentrating and applying more precise technique.  Last but not least ""wake yourself up"" before a fight. Some judoka slap themselves, to inflict some pain to themselves. This immediatly raises their senses to full alert."
judo,2s0bc9,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Tue Jan 13 09:31:17 2015 UTC,"Let me start with the disclaimer: If you are not a judoka, you might be asking the wrong group. Judo competition has several very specific rules that force aggressive behavior. You will be penalized if you are not continuously on the attack. Whereas in Ju-jitsu it is quite acceptable to sit back and wait for the right moment.   If you are referring to just having confidence before grading or competition, there is no substitute for randori (known as rolling in ju-jitsu circles). Once you've given and received hundreds of throws/pins/submissions you lose the performance anxiety. By that point you know exactly what you can/cannot pull off at the moment."

Review by Stephen Koepfer  Igor Kurinnoy is a 5-time world cup champion in Sambo, a 3-time world champion in Sambo, international Judo champion, and amateur Sumo world champion. After much anticipation, Kurinnoy has finally released his third Sambo For Professionals Instructional DVD ROM: Physical Preparation for the Fighter.   What most people don’t know is that in addition to kicking serious butt, Igor Kurinnoy also holds a Ph.D. in Exercise Science. This new instructional is the winner of the All-Russian Contest for the Sport Scientist.  Having trained with Igor and experienced his rigorous conditioning routines first hand, I was very excited to get a look at his new instructional…and it did not disappoint!  This instructional is unique in the field of conditioning programs. While some of the exercises presented are not new (others were new to me), what makes this program so valuable is the comprehensive nature of the presentation as well as the analysis program which tracks a fighter’s (or team’s) progress over time.  The program is broken into five categories:  1) Theoretical introduction to physical conditioning; 2) Complex of exercises; 3) Set of assessment tests; 4) Database and analysis program; 5) Examples of techniques in competition.  The theoretical overview provides an exhaustive scientific explanation behind the principles of conditioning athletes.  Section 2, the Complex of Exercises offers through written and video explanation a total of 145 exercises. These exercises are then divided into areas of focus including strength, speed, endurance, flexibility, agility, coordination, and stability. For each area of focus, warm-up and recovery parameters are provided along with a list of needed equipment and time frames for a work out in each area. At the conclusion of this section an written and video example of a 16-station circuit training regimen is provided along with time frames for completion.  The exercises demonstrated cover a wide range in ability (from beginner to advanced levels) and uses partners, natural weight, ordinary objects, and gym equipment. Plyometrics, acrobatics, games, partner drills, stretching, and mobility drills are all covered. Many are sport specific drills, which would benefit any grappler. Others are not sport specific and would benefit any fighter regardless of style. In fact, this program is not Sambo specific. Kurinnoy recommends using primarily partner drills if possible.  Following the outline of exercises, section 3 offers a comprehensive set of physical tests from which an athlete or coach can create a baseline and track a fighter’s progress over time. There are 19 tests in the assessment protocol.  Section 4 is the Database Program in which a fighter’s data can be entered an evaluated over time. The program creates an “Athlete Card” which is a profile of the athlete along with the athlete’s historical assessments. These profiles are printable and can be kept for a multitude athletes. Once the raw data is entered, the program will provide a complex overall analysis of the athlete’s strengths and areas of need – complete with charts and graphs. This is an invaluable tool for any coach who is monitoring a team of athletes, as databases for each team member can be stored, edited, updated, evaluated, and printed.  In section 5, a follow-up from Sambo For Professionals Volumes 1 & 2 in offered. In this section, videos from high-level competition are show to demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques show in prior volumes…and by default, the value of good conditioning.  After going through the program, I found myself overwhelmed by the amount of information and the way it is organized and presented. By moving from a DVD to a computer program model (as with all the SFP series), Kurinnoy has broken a mold that should have been broken a long time ago.  The ability one has to jump from topic to topic as well as the user friendly nature of the program leaves every other DVD in the dust.  There are a few important notes to mention in regard to using the program. This program requires a DVD ROM. It will not work in a CD ROM drive.

judo,2rtrgg,breakbefallen,4,Fri Jan 9 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there even ARE judogis for women.  You just get a Mizuno/Fuji/whatever in your size and run with it.  The BJJ gi industry is largely composed of martial arts fashionistas, which is where the entire concept of ""ladies gis"" comes from, IMO."
judo,2rtrgg,groteborsten,2,Fri Jan 9 06:53:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think that ladies' BJJ gis are necessarily about fashion - the cut is different than the men's gis. I like to have my pants at my natural waist, and ladies' BJJ gi pants are cut to allow for this, whereas with my 'regular' gi the pants become too short. Tbth though, I don't like all the patches on BJJ gis..."
judo,2rtrgg,geocattes,1 point,Fri Jan 9 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"I dig what you're saying re fashionistas, and I'm not interested in patches or silly colors, but as a lady with a narrow waist and a bit of junk in her trunk I can't help but feel there's gotta be something a bit more suited to my build."
judo,2rtrgg,groteborsten,3,Fri Jan 9 12:42:14 2015 UTC,"If I didn't want to get slapped in the face, I'd ask a woman at my club what size she got (plain Fuji single).  She fits your description, though she's a bit on the short side.  Since I'm a (male) shorter player with thick legs, chest, and shoulders, I bought a Mizuno gi a half size up (aka the upper end of my acceptable size range), shrunk them in the wash and tumble dryer as much as I could, then hemmed the pants so that the bottoms weren't tripping me up during practice.  Maybe you could try that.  But if you don't believe me about there being no judogi equivalent of BJJ's ""women's gis"", look for yourself.  Judogi tend to be baggier than BJJ gis anyway, so perfect fits aren't as much of a concern."

judo,2rrnay,viagraeater,7,Thu Jan 8 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"Keep practicing your break falls and work on your breathing.   Judo is not easy and getting thrown around is never fun. But learning to fall correctly and having good training partners helps.   Stick with it, at least for a while. It's incredibly rewarding."
judo,2rrnay,Kobzor,6,Thu Jan 8 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"I just started judo a few months ago, so I haven't been exposed to anything SUPER dangerous in regards to falls yet, but in my experience so far you really do just have to practice your ukemi nonstop. I had some lessons where I felt dizzy as well after the exertion, but that's more my poor diet than hitting my head.   I advise you try slapping the mat harder and at different angles to see if that helps lessen the impact. Also, it should be habit to NEVER allow your head to touch the mat, or so they say in my dojo, this includes warming up doing sit-ups, etc. Make sure to lift your neck sufficiently so when you fall it doesn't rebound off the mat, and if you can do so, avoid falling flat on your back (let yourself roll a bit onto a shoulder when falling to transfer more energy). Finally,once you start practicing zenpo kaiten make sure to take it slow in the beginning (no need to do the roll and spring straight up to a defensive position, in fact, we weren't allowed to do so until our sensei was certain everyone's legs were falling the right way to avoid getting tangled).  That may not be too helpful, but when I first got started (and even now) I seriously worried for head injuries and what I noted above has helped lessen the impact of my falls considerably; my main problem was not slapping the mat hard enough, maybe yours is something different."
judo,2rrnay,Hero_of_the_Sky,5,Thu Jan 8 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"You are doing an impact sport, so the risk for injury is always there. I dont see it as more of a risk than playing football or other traditional American/Western sports. But you do have to work on breakfalls, they will keep you from serious injury. I practiced Judo for 10 years and the only really bad injury I got was from a really badly done throw mixed with a really bad break fall and I snapped my collar bone. Other than that, just a few broken toes/fingers."
judo,2rrnay,RBRR,10,Thu Jan 8 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"Look, Judo is a combat sport. It's not if you get hurt, it's when and how bad.  That said, embrace the suck.  This shit ain't supposed to be easy. If it was, EVERYBODY would be doing it.  Pop a couple naproxen for your aches and get back to practicing your breakfalls."
judo,2rrnay,Kung_Fu_Cowboy,3,Thu Jan 8 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely work on not hitting your head when you fall. Tuck your chin! (You'll hear that a lot.) Practice falling as much as you can.  The rolling can make you light-headed, and that goes away as you get used to it and (in the shorter-term) as you get warmed up. I still stand up a bit dizzy after my first couple rolls in a practice.  If you're concerned about concussions, you might want to talk to a doctor about the symptoms. I doubt you're getting concussed on your first day of Judo, and if you were you'd be feeling it after practice, not just during. But I'm not a doctor."
judo,2rrnay,war_lobster,2,Thu Jan 8 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"Good point, maybe the dizziness was from rolling and possibly dehydration. I will work on my falling."

Ukemi is tumbling, then standing up again, then tumbling, then standing up again. All the tumbling will mess with your inner ear no matter what, and the standing up with mea with your blood pressure. Unless your head hurts, don't worry about it too much.  Edit: not to mention that you're exercisig, which could make you dizzy no matter what the exercise."

judo,2rrnay,doseofvitamink,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:17:20 2015 UTC,"Dizziness can come from being inverted like when you are doing a roll. If you have just started judo, it could also be because you are not used to the level of judo fitness that is required. You are exercising! It can take a toll on the uninitiated. It certainly did for me. I remember getting dizzy, fainting, and vomiting after some randori sessions earlier in my career.  It could also be a concussion... :<"
judo,2rrnay,Bartsches,1 point,Fri Jan 9 05:58:20 2015 UTC,"As others said: Pracrice ukemi. Tuck in your head. Keep your head away from the ground when falling. Don't just nod when you tuck in your head, keep you neck muscles tense until the impact is over. Practice ukemi. Hydrate properly and timely before, during and after training. Practice ukemi."
judo,2rrnay,rocketman500,1 point,Fri Jan 9 09:21:55 2015 UTC,"If you're feeling dizzy, you should stop until you are recovered. Talk to a health care provider to make sure you're not concussed.  You're gonna get banged up a bit in Judo, but a few things will happen:   You'll learn to fall better. You need to take lots of falls. Fall until it is fun. The more you're afraid of falling, the harder your landings tend to be. You'll learn to train smarter. Randori is not shiai, and the goal is not to go 100%. You're not competing in the dojo, you're cooperating to train techniques. Save the crazy stuff for competition, if you choose to compete. Different clubs have different views of training. Find one that suits your level of physicality, but be willing to push yourself some."
judo,2rrnay,Ryvai,1 point,Fri Jan 9 14:51:15 2015 UTC,I remember feeling dizzy after each training for a long time after I started and I still feel when I had a longer break in between. Reason for is simply my circulation having a problem with me going up and down fast. If you feel like there could be more to it you might want to check with your doctor just as a precautionary measure. Gives peace of mind which alone can be worth it. And should you really have something it would be good to find early.  On the subject of health in general I've had two occasions were knowing how to fall really saved me from injury. As such at least for me judo has an very positive effect on my health over all.

judo,2ropjk,PurppleHaze,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:18:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's not exactly ""pretty"", but he's done alright.  How would you classify the throws he used?  Having watched the clip once, I'd go with:  -Sumi otoshi following an attempted osotogari.   Te guruma as a counter. Drop seoi nage variation."
judo,2ropjk,SVPPB,2,Thu Jan 8 00:11:17 2015 UTC,"His first score I believe fits in the category of sumi-otoshi. His second score (where he grabs the leg) is most times referred to as obi-tori-gaeshi which can be seen in this old Kodokan video. This particular application is also called the 'Khabarelli', named after a famous Georgian Judoka using it to much prevail in the 70's and 80's. Illiadis is also Georgian, so there's probably a deep connection to the throw there, hehe. Obi-tori-gaeshi is now included as a variation under the official name hikikomi-gaeshi in modern Kodokan terminology, but the IJF still seperates between hikikomi-gaeshi and obi-tori-gaeshi (see IJF techniques page). Before the end of the fight he attempts sode-tsurikomi-goshi but fails to enter (it would be a massive ippon for sure). His final scoring is seoi-otoshi, but many could call it drop eri-seoi-nage, which is one of his signature moves. Hope that helps :)"
judo,2ropjk,Ryvai,2,Thu Jan 8 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it really does!  Would you say a drop seoi nage is a kind of seoi otoshi?  At my club they are taught as two different throws (In fact, drop seoi is discouraged because it's hard on tori's knees).  As for obi tori gaeshi, that's not the way I've been taught. My teacher emphasizes the sacrifice part a bit more, making it more similar to sumi gaeshi."
judo,2ropjk,SVPPB,2,Thu Jan 8 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"Any 'drop' seoi-nage to both knees where you are not lifting up (pushing away with the feet) afterwards is seoi-otoshi. 'Otoshi' ironically means 'to drop'. Sometimes it's seoi-otoshi, sometimes it's just seoi-nage, it depends on how the throw is performed.   The obi-tori-gaeshi you've been taught is probably a sumi-gaeshi but by grabbing the belt, which is the definition of hikikomi-gaeshi and how the standard way is done, the 'Khabarelli' is just an variation of obi-tori-gaeshi. Obi-tori-gaeshi is an old term, but many old-school sensei are still clinging to the old names, which causes confusion to student trying to learn the modern terminology."

It breaks down when experienced grapplers from other disciplines hit the mats, but i've only experienced that a couple of times over the years, so I'm not sure that a few notable exceptions are grounds for changing the way things work.

I skimmed the rules but currently I'm a bit caught up on the terminology used.   I'm assuming takedowns like single leg, double leg, ankle picks, etc are illegal in the IJF now, correct? Is a duck under legal if it is followed by a sweep or reap? Is a flying armbar legal? Can I place someone in a chokehold while throwing them so I'm setup to apply the choke on the ground?"
judo,2rn4ei,indigoCamel18,3,Wed Jan 7 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"All leg grabs are illegal. Duck under would be legal as long as you don't grab below the belt. Many eastern Europeans do a version of a duck under to attack with a suplex, which in my opinion would be the only reason to do one in judo. Flying armbar is legal, probably won't catch very many people with it. Yes but I can't imagine it being successful.   Best advice I can give you having cross trained in wrestling and bjj is to try and learn as much of the judo basics and practice as much judo as you can. Then later look to incorporate your sambo. Otherwise you will just hinder your learning and your judo."
judo,2rn4ei,freezingsleep,0,Thu Jan 8 00:48:09 2015 UTC,yes they are now illegal. I'm unfamiliar with the term Duck under. I believe that it is illegal in competition although there is some ambiguity on the subject. No you cannot place them in a choke hold while throwing them. You must throw then set up the choke after the throw.
judo,2rn4ei,Ionya1337,2,Wed Jan 7 20:00:52 2015 UTC,Thanks that clears things up quite a bit.  A duck under is where you move your head underneath their armpit but keep it raised up by keeping your hips low: http://www.wrestlingcoach.com/Duck%20Under.jpg  Frame 4 and 5.

judo,2rn4ei,DysonMachine,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"Article 16. It isn't a 'throwing technique' per 16.2.a. It isn't taking advantage of a failed throw per 16.2.b. It isn't 'a contestant...applying...Kansetsu-waza in the standing position and then [changing] without interruption into newaza'  per 16.2.c because the flying contestant is no longer standing. It isn't taking advantage of a contestant's fall per 16.2.e.   It may be considered a 'particularly skillful application of a movement that does not qualify as a throwing technique', per 16.2.d. To any fair-minded, red-blooded judoka, it certainly ought to be considered as such. But since such 'particularly skillful...movements' are not further defined, referees have effectively unlimited discretion on this point, and a sufficiently bloody-minded, idiotic, blind, or rabidly traditionalist referee would be perfectly within the letter of the rules to award shido.  Similar referee's-discretion problems could apply to Article 27.b.29 or 35 ('Flying submissions may endanger or injure the opponent and/or are against the spirit of judo, because I say so'), Though as hansoku-make offences, it would technically be a referee's-and-a-majority-of-judges' discretion problem.

Also, those are your words, not the words in article 27 or 35.  Here is the current rule set with quick links for you.  I see the one you are referring to is 4 years old.  http://judopedia.com/index.php/International_Judo_Federation_%28Refereeing_Rules_-_2014-2016%29"
judo,2rn4ei,pryoslice,0,Tue Jan 13 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find it either, but honestly how many times have you ever seen it happen? It's pretty rare and some instructors teach it some don't."
judo,2rn4ei,Kzraahk,2,Wed Jan 7 23:33:16 2015 UTC,"There are examples on YouTube like this, although this is not the typical style you'd see in BJJ."
judo,2rn4ei,DysonMachine,5,Thu Jan 8 00:49:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, but what my instructor told me is that they ARE legal, but you have to get to the floor before you start applying pressure to the joint"
judo,2rn4ei,geocattes,2,Thu Jan 8 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"I've not seen it happen very many times but I used to practice it.  It's just hard to find an uke that can cooperate for practical purposes.  All standing arm locks are legal, only a falling wake gatame is specifically prohibited.  I also can't find any mention of standing chokes not being allowed, but it does say that you can't throw with the neck.  IJF rules that is, current release.  To lazy to link. :P"
judo,2rn4ei,geocattes,2,Thu Jan 8 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"My instructor asked me the other week if I was interested in testing for my yellow belt... I guess I am, but I don't know how I feel about it really - I do need to work on some of the techniques I just learned that I need to do for the test. I'm not sure when the test will be yet, and I have been practising some things on the curriculum. I was wondering if anyone had any effective strategies for practising for tests?   edit: I'm concerned about the osaekomi, since I'm not really that good at holding people down.."
judo,2rn4ei,indigoCamel18,3,Wed Jan 7 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"Exams are different from country to country, from fedaration to federation and even from examiner to examiner, thus we probably can give you only very general advise.   Relax, it's yellow belt ""only"", not 4th dan. Do your best. Always. It's all you can do. If your instructor asks such things, he probably thinks you are ready. Ask someone (maybe an advanced player who can help you) to practice the stuff you need to practice. Ask for extra mat time.  Specifically osaekomi waza:    Distribute your weight evenly, create a wide base, keep your head down Remain flexible. Change your position whenever you feel your current position is weakened somehow. That may be just changing the way you sit/kneel/lie or even the hold itself, depending on the situation."
judo,2rn4ei,geocattes,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:29:52 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! Just one question - I have to do yoko shiho gatame and tate shiho gatame - is it acceptable to change grips and positioning slightly and still be the same technique?
judo,2rn4ei,deputy_of_love,2,Thu Jan 8 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you are supposed to demonstrate the techniques, but as long it is on a cooperative partner, just do it the way you were taught. In a more randori like situation you have to adapt to the given situation."
judo,2rn4ei,iateyourkimchi,2,Thu Jan 8 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Most yellow belt gradings are pretty relaxed. When you say you are concerned with osaekomi because you aren't good at holding people down. Don't worry about it. They don't expect you to be a master of anything really yet. Where I am from the requirements to get a yellow are the ability to do proper break falls, know a few techniques (not know them cold but can do them adequately) and a few ground techniques as well. Typically as well your instructor will grade you when they think it is time so they probably feel you are ready anyways. In terms of practicing for a yellow belt, just keep showing up to class and do your best. Most of Judo is learnt through experience, its an art not a science so advice from other longer practicing members is very valuable."
judo,2rn4ei,judokid78,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help! I have a list of techniques (about 7-8 throws, 2 osaekomi waza, 2 kansetsu waza, and 1 shimewaza) to do. I have to execute each throw three times- one still, one moving, and one 'self defense' style. I also have to do 3-5 rounds of randori. My friend tested for his green belt recently and to pass he couldn't fail any of the rounds, so I think that's also stressing me out... everyone in class is at a higher level (or much, much larger) than me. I'm going to try my best. Thanks for the advice again!"
judo,2rn4ei,indigoCamel18,2,Thu Jan 8 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"I just earned my orange belt and I feel that I can perform lots of  techniques adequately; I'm no expert, but my form is relatively good at say, tai otoshi, ko soto gari, etc. However, when I'm in a randori setting, I have a lot of trouble figuring out on the fly how to react to my opponent; how to get myself into positions to exploit his/her lack of balance.  Besides the obvious (lots more randori), is there any way I can work on this?"
judo,2rn4ei,Brian175,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:37:43 2015 UTC,I would recommend having a relaxed grip and not think so hard about how not to get thrown. Start by noticing how your movement and position is to your opponent. Most new judokas I've noticed try to muscle and win at all costs. But I think its much more fun accepting the throw except when you compete.
judo,2rn4ei,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Wed Jan 7 21:32:39 2015 UTC,Try drilling combos and seeing where and when your partner is off balance.
judo,2rn4ei,attouteki_takoukan,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:53:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. situational throwing practice, meaning not practicing only one setup all the time, but practicing throws from various positions, on both sides and especially from different movement directions (the options vary of course from technique to technique). Also combination chains. By doing that often enough, you'll automatize reacting to a given/provoked opportunity. It takes time of course."
judo,2rn4ei,Brian175,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:25:55 2015 UTC,"Could you explain a bit more, and also how long have you been doing judo?"
judo,2rn4ei,attouteki_takoukan,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:44:28 2015 UTC,I know Judo tends to grip the gi more. Do any of you guys find more wrestling style grips to be really effective like a whizzer or just straight up underhooks during randori?
judo,2rn4ei,RBGForever,2,Thu Jan 8 00:53:53 2015 UTC,"Even if you use wrestling grips you're better off grabbing the gi as well. A whizzer is stronger and more versatile if you can grab the lapel with your dominant hand, after winding it under uke's arm. Underhooks can finish with grabbing the back, under the lats, or by holding the belt.  Sometimes you won't need it but it's always nice to have that extra control."
judo,2rn4ei,counterpig,1 point,Thu Jan 8 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"I've been nailing people who underhook me during randori with sumi gaeshi a lot. Don't know why there's a sudden uptick in the underhooks, but I'm not complaining about the opportunity to train a good gaeshiwaza :)"
judo,2rn4ei,Highwaystar77,1 point,Thu Jan 8 22:17:05 2015 UTC,Are you setting it up by grabbing the back of their belt?
judo,2rn4ei,judokid78,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:43:35 2015 UTC,You got it. Belt/lapel with uke's hand under your pit makes for a really easy sumi if you shoot it right after you grab.
judo,2rnzei,firstworldmonkey,2,Wed Jan 7 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"I used to train there about 5 yrs ago and the instruction was fantastic. Equal parts groundwork and standing throws, lots of drilling and sparring, tons of high ranked guys who have competed, it was an amazing dojo when I went there, not so sure now but I definitely recommend you check it out!"
judo,2rnzei,ActualBlackGuy,1 point,Thu Jan 8 06:23:12 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your reply.  I always try to do a little homework on new places to train and couldn't find much on this place so I really appreciate your info.
judo,2rnzei,Omittedlucidity,2,Fri Jan 9 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know what your schedule is like, or what your goals are (or what part of Chicago you're in for that matter) but you might also look into Tohkon. Classes 7 days a week, international competitors - both club members and people who are just visiting, and instructors who are world champions and former olympians. If you're really looking to up your Judo game it might be worth making the investment. Just a thought."

judo,2rog8p,bigbaze2012,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:48:34 2015 UTC,"Adidas is not the way to go if you want a soft gi.   I would have thought mizuno would be very soft from what I've heard but I've never owned one.   Kusakura are supposed to be extremely comfortable and you can get them tailored. They're also quite cheap since the yen is pretty weak at the moment but you'll pay a lot in shipping.   Avoid European gis if you want ones that are soft eg. Adidas, fighting films etc. I love my adidas and FF gis but they're very right fitting and hard in comparison to most other gis, which it doesn't sound like you want."
judo,2rog8p,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:26:35 2015 UTC,Any opinions on the fuji?
judo,2rog8p,stuckoverhere,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"Of the single weaves I have, Fuji and Mizuno are nearly a draw, with Fuji maybe having a slight edge in the softness department. Adidas are like sandpaper but otherwise they're fine, and fit wise they're my favorite. Wear a rashguard and get an Adidas if you're going single weave.   If you're willing to cough up the extra bucks for a double weave though, I really enjoy my Fuji. I have way too many gis."
judo,2rog8p,vsk12,1 point,Thu Jan 8 06:27:24 2015 UTC,"Never go with a fuji some shrink inches, and some don't shrink at all. If you're buying a fuji gi don't expect a perfect fit."
judo,2rog8p,groteborsten,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:24:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Fuji seems a bit inconsistent there.  I had one Fuji that shrunk considerably, while another didn't shrink one iota, resulting in me having two gis of the same brand that had one fitting like a BJJ gi, and another like an oversized set of jammies."
judo,2rog8p,TroxX,1 point,Sun Jan 11 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"depends if you want to fight in IJF tournaments you will need a gi that is IFJ-04/2015 approved, until now I used Addidas for the last couple of years they are great :)"
judo,2rog8p,Category_theory,1 point,Thu Jan 8 11:37:51 2015 UTC,Get a Fuji double. It's cheap and amazing. I've owned everything from Dax to Kusakura to Fuji and it's the best bang for your buck hands down!
judo,2rlhxz,robertritz,4,Wed Jan 7 04:47:40 2015 UTC,"Wrestling is an ancient part of Mongolian tradition. It also provides real economic opportunity in a nation growing rapidly into modernity. Thus, schools are packed with participants who are highly motivated. This is always a formula for success."
judo,2rlhxz,skytomorrownow,3,Fri Jan 9 04:04:36 2015 UTC,"I grew up as a kid in Mongolia. All we did was smoke cigarettes and wrestle in the dusty, abandoned playground behind our school after class. In the winter when there was literally feet of snow, we would jump down from roofs of buildings into puffy white snow. Keep in mind, I only lived there until I was 11. I have no idea how they kept themselves entertained after that age."
judo,2rlhxz,bati555,1 point,Sun Jan 11 21:55:37 2015 UTC,"Mongolians are entering into an age of Modernity and with a history of wrestling in their culture, Judo was the perfect cross over considering the financial incentives.

judo,2rjiql,trumfnator,2,Wed Jan 7 08:23:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I have done randori with Komuro Sensei and it was not boring, dull or unimaginative at all."
judo,2rjiql,skytomorrownow,2,Wed Jan 7 18:32:32 2015 UTC,"Care to elaborate?  Do you refer to the video? Then I say: these are just basics. Do you refer to Koji Komuro? Then i'm confused, because he's one of the best and also competes in bjj and sambo.  Do you mean in general? There's room for debate, I think.  What's your point? You have to give us something here."
judo,2rhslo,meany-pants,5,Tue Jan 6 07:31:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I've seen this guy before. He's a good judoka but he isn't as good as he makes himself out to be.   You don't win 300 medals and go undefeated  if you're competing against the best people, even koga couldn't do that. Most international competitors who are world champs are lucky to have an 80% win ratio.   Big fish small pond springs to mind with this guy."

judo,2rhslo,Ryvai,-3,Tue Jan 6 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"I just can't believe people with red-white belts pronounce uke as uki. The 'e', in uke,  is pronounced as the 'e' in the word 'set'. his technique is decent, no doubt, but i have problems with people teaching techniques like tai-otoshi with unequal weight balance (70-30) as 'default'. The norm and default is 50-50 weight distribution on the legs, it's a hand throw, your own balance is more important. It can be done this way ofcourse, but it is not the standard way, too many beginners injure themselfs trying to emulate this deep japanese stance without control. Also osoto-gari is not all that diagonal, it can be done this way, but that is his preference, not the default.  I like this guy, short and to-the-point videos, however i've always been sceptical to boasting about years of experience. A great japanese master once said (dont remember his name) that; There is a difference between 10 years of experience and 1 year of experience repeated 10 times. I think there is a lot of truth in that statement. If he has spent 40 years developing new elements of his game and discovering new techniques, then great. But doing 2.000.000 uchikomi on seoinage means just that, you know seoinage. I prefer a broader experiwnce with certain specialties :)"
judo,2rhslo,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Tue Jan 6 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"I don't remember where I read that, but the 30:70 (where 70 percent is on the ""blocking"" leg) weight distribution is allegedly the Japanese way of doing Tai Otoshi, whereas 50:50 is the style used in the West... Personally I think it's a matter of the version and setup one wants to use.  An uneven weight distribution may be useful in so far, as creating it requires a shift to the throwing side, which can be used to push uke into that direction. That's just a thought though, I still gotta work on my own Tai Otoshi a lot."
judo,2rhslo,Ryvai,1 point,Fri Jan 9 23:43:20 2015 UTC,"If 70% of your weight is on the blocking leg, it would be very weird. Are you sure it's not the other way around? It's still possible to have a 50/50 distribution and the legs look asymmetrical, you twist your blocking leg slightly to protect your knee from getting damaged :)"
judo,2rhslo,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sat Jan 10 12:54:32 2015 UTC,I found the source of the information: http://thedifficultway.blogspot.de/2011/05/tai-otoshi.html  I love that blog. Unfortunately it isn't updated anymore.
judo,2rhslo,carasci,1 point,Sat Jan 10 13:05:55 2015 UTC,"I just can't believe people with red-white belts pronounce uke as uki. The 'e', in uke, is pronounced as the 'e' in the word 'set'.   The 'e' in 'ukemi' can sometimes sound like the 'e' in 'set', but the 'e' in 'uke' usually does not: it's more of a long 'e' sound, with the 'ke' being somewhat closer to a clipped version of the 'kay' in 'okay'.  'Uki,' however, is indeed right out."
judo,2rhslo,Ryvai,1 point,Tue Jan 6 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds about right. A clipped 'e' is probably more correct way of putting it. Syd Hoare writes in his book that it's more like the 'e' in the word 'pet' :)"
judo,2rhslo,Geschichtenerzaehler,0,Tue Jan 6 23:45:27 2015 UTC,"I looked through it a bit. His technique looks crisp. I am not sure about some details in the execution here and there, though. That doesn't mean I disagree or say it's bad, I just cannot assess if these ""deviations"" in the details make the technique better, worse or just different."
judo,2rhslo,Kosoto_Gake,3,Tue Jan 6 09:44:44 2015 UTC,"His technique's good. You don't have bad technique if you do judo for 40 years.   However, he hasn't competed in any big competitions as far as I'm aware. He was part of the BJC for years until he left for JFA after promoting people to first dan without doing the competition requirement. I'm not sure how true this is but I found it in a google search.   When he became part of JFA he was awarded his eight dan, to put this into perspective Neil Adams is 8th dan and he's an ex world champion.   JFA are not part of the IJF and as such I very much doubt the kodokan recognise his grade.   At the end of the day, if you devote so much time into judo you'd think you'd want to be as good as you could be but as I said before, he seems to be a big fish in a small pond."
judo,2rhslo,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Tue Jan 6 10:09:14 2015 UTC,"His technique's good.   I think so, too. I just had a few ""Why does he do it that way?""-moments here and there watching his clips.   You don't have bad technique if you do judo for 40 years.    If someone practices correctly indeed, but you'd be surprised what kind of bullshido people can do for 40 years, thinking they are totally great while they are not. I am not refering to him here of course.   he was awarded his eight dan, to put this into perspective Neil Adams is 8th dan and he's an ex world champion.    Competition success and titles are a certain indicator for a judoka's capabilities, yes, but I also think, that a judoka can deserve a high rank without those, if he or she is a technical expert and excellent instructor."
judo,2rhslo,Kosoto_Gake,2,Tue Jan 6 10:27:01 2015 UTC,"True, but then then I wouldn't boast on my website that I'd won 300 gold medals and never been defeated in competition, when it's fairly obvious they were against nobodies."

One a gym and the other a boys and girls club.  Personally I would ask if you could visit a class at each and go from there.  My lean would be toward the boys and girls club simply because of price.    Edit: At least one other club came up on a search of USA judo.  You may want to look into these as well.

The important thing is to take it easy at that next training: your body knows how to do judo, your mind wants to play hard...but you're not in condition. Your soft tissues aren't used to the impacts, your joints aren't as strong as they were, your reflexes are rusty. Now is a prime time to get injured by fighting too much like the old you. Ease yourself back into training with care."

judo,2rhuw9,SVPPB,3,Tue Jan 6 08:46:19 2015 UTC,"It gets better. I came back to judo at age 29. The morning after the first class I was sore all over and I was shocked that repeated ukemi were so hard on my body.  Then, for the next two months, I was always coming home bruised, with pain in my joints or with a pulled muscle.  After that, I pretty much adapted to it, and now I feel fine after class."

judo,2rhuw9,Kosoto_Gake,2,Tue Jan 6 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"Only stretch after your session, stretching before hand can actually lead to more injuries. You do, however, want to do a nice warm up before your session."
judo,2rhuw9,C4Aries,2,Tue Jan 6 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's possible to injure yourself from stretching unless you're cold. You should still stretch a little before a session, although static stretches are supposed to limit performance.   Dynamic stretching on the other hand is done by Olympic athletes and I'm not about to disagree with that."
judo,2rhuw9,Kosoto_Gake,2,Tue Jan 6 10:23:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, dynamic stretching is good and I try to do it as apart of my warmup. Most people don't know the difference though, so when you say ""stretch"" they will likely assume you mean static stretching.   My dojo has started doing static stretches as a part of the work out and I hate it. I hope to find a way to change their minds on  including it."
judo,2rhuw9,Kosoto_Gake,2,Tue Jan 6 11:12:25 2015 UTC,I still think static stretching is good at the end of a session.   First time back at judo without stretching after and you're asking to not be able to walk.

judo,2ri31h,Jaycobmoloney,2,Tue Jan 6 10:13:31 2015 UTC,"No, when I did my coaching award I was told to teach techniques left and right and from different angles.   You were also supposed to watch everyone, if someone was doing something wrong then you'd correct them and if someone was doing something right then you'd compliment them on it.   It may have been taught to you on one side since you're a beginner and the learning curve for judo is very steep. It may be that you didn't give it long enough and your instructors were waiting to see how you got on, even so I find no feedback whatsoever strange seeing as you were likely making lots of mistakes.   Edit: To clarify, in a REGULAR session I was told to teach left and right. With beginners I usually struggle to get them to keep their strong foot forward and they'll grip right handed but stand left etc. You should concentrate on one side to begin with but the instructor would still normally show left and right."

judo,2ri31h,SVPPB,1 point,Tue Jan 6 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"I've had an instructor that made us drill everything equally on both sides.  My current instructor usually only teaches the right hand version, but is left-handed himself and he strongly recommends using a lefty grip for competition.  Left handed techniques are good to know, but not everyone thinks the cost-benefit ratio is good enough to spend valuable class time drilling them at the same level as their orthodox versions.  Also, for many techniques (like osoto gari), the left attack version can be done from a standard grip.  Personally, I think it's best to just learn the orthodox versions and then work on the lefties on a case by case basis, for gradings and according to your specific style."

judo,2ri31h,DysonMachine,1 point,Tue Jan 6 12:54:01 2015 UTC,"Judo is not bilaterally symmetric. You have to commit to assymetrical grips and if you're squared up to your opponent, you will be foot-swept. You are better off, as a beginner, picking a side and developing a game from the grips you get there.  I don't know how wing-chun works but in judo, there is a good amount of room for each individual to develop their own game. Most judoka have a tokui-waza, or favorite technique, that is their main attack. Everyone will train other techniques and try different things in sparring but eventually each player has their own ""a-game"" they rely on when they want to attack successfully.  If you're right handed then right hand attacks will come more naturally to you and will be stronger than left handed attacks. However, you won't always be able to get strong right-handed grips and most people are accustomed to defending right-handed attacks so there is value in having left-handed tools in your arsenal as well. There is nothing stopping you from doing left-handed uchi-komi or practicing full throws left-handed, just tell your partner ""I'm going to try this left-handed now."" Its probably best to learn the throw properly on one side first, judo throws are complicated movements to do well and one strong attack is better have than two crappy ones.  I'm a beginner at judo and how I handle the left/right hand throw issue is that I have chosen one throw in particular (sei otoshi) to develop as my primary left-handed attack for now and left-side seio nage from right handed grip as well. Most high-level guys attack both sides equally but it takes a long time to get there. There was a study done and the world-class judoka would individually attack about half and half each side while the typical amateurs would be more like 80/20, if I recall."
judo,2rhin1,91echomike,5,Tue Jan 6 05:35:36 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of cross training, it's a matter of seriouly pursuing martial arts, which you obviously do. There are plateaus everywhere. You'll encounter them again and again and when you look upwards, you'll notice that they are just steps of an endless, giant staircase. Think of these plateaus not only as difficult stages of technical advantage but also as tests of your mental endurance. I am sure you are familiar with the saying: ""A black belt is just a whitebelt that never stopped training.""   Tenacity is the key to success, just keep going."

I feel the opposite lull, BJJ makes more sense to me. It agrees with the body's natural flow while Judo sometimes requires more calculated movement.   How are your coaches? My Judo coaches are old school(and exetremely good) and want things done their way, while my BJJ coaches are a little younger and work with me more. How are your coaches?   I've also heard from my BJJ coach that after blue belt is the hardest time to advance in the sport. He claimed that by then you know practical moves, and the rest is mostly perfecting the art to your own style."

I have been going to judo 2 a week and right now it motivates me a lot more than jiu-jitsu. its all i think about all i care to study of the mats.  im assuming if you stick with both things will get back to normal :)"

I feel like it's probably best to pick one to be competitive in at a time until you are of godlike skill or never.  As far as the competitive aspect goes, they are both on 2 sides of the grappling spectrum.  I think this is how it's usually done.  People who compete in both and win are at very high levels usually.  This is merely my experience and opinion, of course..."

judo,2rgway,rocketman500,8,Tue Jan 6 02:16:59 2015 UTC,"One can and should do randori at different intensity levels. It can be done with competition intensity as well as totally playful. The following factors play a role in chosing the intensity: How hard do the two of you want to go at the moment, is there a huge gap of strength or mass (probably more than the technical level of the physical inferior can can compensate), how advanced are the participating judoka are (can they fall properly, can they throw safely?).   A simple guideline would be this: If both of you benefit from the way you do the randori, it's the right way to do it.  Example for bad randori, the black belt applies a throw the whitebelt doesn't know how to fall to:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HOL1ZZT70  Good randori examples:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J1YquJkGlA (The black belt let's the yellow belt throw him when his attack is good enough)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnSMKPS8C_c (an advanced player and master Go Tsunoda have an intense but still playful randori)  This was a great example, but I fear it s blocked everywhere now...  www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMZm4ss-hJw"

So naturally, she gets thrown a lot because she has a huge size and strength disadvantage.  I used to throw her around as much as everyone else, until I realised that the only thing I was really doing was feeding my ego.  So one day I stopped being so aggressive during randori and just let her work her throws and her footwork.  I wasnt just a total pushover and defended reasonably strongly, probably at about 60%.  Afterwards she said that it was the best randori she had ever had and thanked me.  She knew I wasn't going as hard as I could but she appreciated the opportunity to work her footwork and technique without having to worry about my size and strength being a factor.  Ever since then I always randori with her in the same way."

My advice would be to concentrate on one or two forward throws and do lots of uchikomi reps till you get the footwork, then introduce it on a moving opponent with Kuzushi, then introduce it into randori.   You not being explosive enough is not what is holding you back."
judo,2qwms8,Kosoto_Gake,2,Wed Dec 31 09:15:46 2014 UTC,That's a really good point. I am still quite inexperienced so I guess time and practice will help even more than a training program focusing on explosiveness. Thanks for the tips!
judo,2qwms8,Ryvai,3,Thu Jan 1 00:36:09 2015 UTC,"It is hard to recommend any training regiment for you without knowing anything about your current physiology. I think it is safe to say that speed, technique and conditioning would be more important in this phase of your technical development. Once the technical level is high enough, very little effort can be utilized in throwing an opponent, explosiveness comes at a later stage. Not getting tired as easily will increase your concentration and in the end allow you to absorb more from your senses (e.g. balance and feeling of opportunity) that you will need to ""understand"" the techniques you are about to learn :)"
judo,2qwms8,Paladin_PDX,3,Wed Dec 31 13:03:51 2014 UTC,"As others are saying, focus on timing, technique, working combinations etc. otherwise you're just going to explode yourself into a counter. that said I love to advocate for strength training so here's my speeel when it comes to supplemental strength for Judo.  Ideally you can find access to olympic lifting trainers and equipment (bumper plates) start working that style lifting. powercleans and snatch.  Assuming you're a peasant like me, with no access to specialized training or equipment. You will be doing basic core lifts while adding in a few supplemental exercises.    Basic sprints are a most undervalued exercise. Sprints will make you more explosive, while enlarging your gas tank. Personally I feel like box jumps are probably a worthy addition, but are too dangerous to be doing all the time in a gym. I have seen several people fuck these up and look like total morons. A jumping rope routine with lots of foot work should suffice, again. anyone can be ""explosive"" it's the gas tank that matters.    without good technique you'll just be exploding all over the place for no good reason. you need to have the timing and technique to recognize when and how to utilize your strength. Good luck!"
judo,2qwms8,realyfunky,2,Wed Dec 31 16:56:47 2014 UTC,"I agree. Small steps. Get the the grip, the footwork, the breaking of the balance and the turn in right in your throw, then you can speed it up. In order to be ""explosive"" you have to maximise your power in the right direction as you drive through the throw."

judo,2qwms8,sawskankredemption,1 point,Wed Dec 31 09:52:21 2014 UTC,"So I'll just add y 2c here.  If you're in a competitive mode, building strengthis key OFC.  But as the black belt said, being a yellow belt you will benefit more through uchikomi than you would through becoming stronger.  I've found that the stronger judoka, (naturally) tend to use strength than rely on the power of the technique.   A 6th dan from France visited us once and the ease of which he was able to execute 'explosive' throws always fascinated me, Dude could have been 65+ he looked rather frail. But his timing and movement was so perfect he needed very little strength.   The perfectly timed gentle footsweep. beats a brute force attempt 9/10 times.   Perfection through timing..  HOWEVER (i'm training for explosive power as well)  I would suggest 5x5 stronglift program.  You want to focus on Deadlifts, Power Clean, Bench, Squat and Over Head Press Basically the big lifts, and work your way up .  5x5 stronglift will increase your strenght quite fast, and then skipping to lower weights but being able to 'rip it off' the floor in a deadlift will show you your explosive power..  e.g. my 1rm with a deadlift is 335.  However I compete in the under 90 KG category, so I need to ensure that my 180lb deadlift form, is not only strong AF, but i'm quick and have proper form with it.   TO summarize: Timing over strenght, If you want to build strength i suggest following the Stronglift 5x5 program."
judo,2qwms8,ChristopherMarv,2,Fri Jan 2 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"I'm training my strength not only to get stronger but to get heavier. There is literally nobody in my division. I weight 60kg and i get to fight -66kg when I'm lucky because there is just nobody as light as me for my age. Last year, when I had my first competition I weighted 54kg and I was in the same situation so that's why after this summer I decided to start training.   I'll start looking into deadlifts, power clean and over head. I already did the bench and squats in my program though. Thanks for the tips!"

He points out they are likely to be too short and/or offer too much resistance, resulting in you being unable to complete the 'full turn' that you really want to be doing. Buy a much longer type resistance band like others have linked below, they are quite cheap, I got some off amazon for about £3."

judo,2qovdj,blo2569,4,Mon Dec 29 07:36:29 2014 UTC,"Section 2. Kimura vs% Hélio Gracie of article  Masahiko Kimura:       In 1949, after winning multiple fights against boxers, wrestlers and Savate fighters in Europe, Kimura decided to go to Brazil after an invitation by Helio Gracie. Helio Gracie issued a challenge to Kimura.  An agreement was made under what would be known as the ""Gracie Rules"" via the Gracie Challenge that throws and pins would NOT count towards victory only submission or loss of consciousness.  This played against Judo rules in which Pins and throws can award someone a victory.  In 1951, Kimura defeated Hélio Gracie of the Gracie Jiu Jitsu family in a submission Judo match held in Brazil.  During the fight Kimura threw Gracie repeatedly with Ippon Seoinage (one arm shoulder throw), Ouchi Gari (major inner reap), Uchimata (inner thigh throw), Harai Goshi (sweeping hip throw), and Osoto Gari (major outer reap). However, Helio Gracie was able to perform ukemi, as demonstrated by his earlier match with Kimura's fellow judoka Kato, was in excellent condition, benefited from the soft mat used in competition, and showed a strong will to win and refusal to lose - he was undeterred.  Unable to subdue Helio through throwing alone, the fight progressed into groundwork. Kimura maintained a dominance in the fight at this point by using techniques such as kuzure-kamishiho-gatame (modified upper four corner hold), kesa-gatame (scarf hold), and sankaku-jime (triangle choke). Thirteen minutes into the bout Kimura positioned himself to apply a reverse ude-garami (arm entanglement, a shoulderlock). ""Helio shook his head trying to breathe. He could not take it any longer, and tried to push up my body extending his left arm. That moment, I grabbed his left wrist with my right hand, and twisted up his arm. I applied Udegarami. I thought he would surrender immediately. But Helio would not tap the mat. I had no choice but keep on twisting the arm. The stadium became quiet. The bone of his arm was coming close to the breaking point. Finally, the sound of bone breaking echoed throughout the stadium. Helio still did not surrender. His left arm was already powerless. Under this rule, I had no choice but twist the arm again. There was plenty of time left. I twisted the left arm again. Another bone was broken. Helio still did not tap. When I tried to twist the arm once more, a white towel was thrown in. I won by TKO"" http://www.bjjee.com/articles/my-judo-by-masahiko-kimura-his-story-vision-in-his-own-words-part-2/ and http://judoinfo.com/kimura.htm.

I'd call this video a quickguide on the general ideas, but not any tutorial. He is even utilizing several tricks on one side, but not the other. Look how he is bending the collar outwards before gripping near the chin? That is one of the minor details that makes the choke incredibly more effective that I've learned from BJJ, yet makes no mention of it :)"

I'm loyal to my club because they're a good bunch of people and I enjoy training there, you shouldn't be forced to remain loyal to a club.

judo,2qldvr,NDNguitarguy,1 point,Thu Jan 1 12:05:23 2015 UTC,"THIS video of Inoue is about the closest I can find to uki otoshi.  Technically speaking uki otoshi shouldn't be any harder to perform than tai otoshi. The main issue with it is setup. Uke needs to be almost falling over from bridging into you, a situation most judoka are taught to avoid, and the step back and drop action needs to be fast enough and strong enough that uke can't avoid the throw by stepping forward.  Combine the rather specific setup with the facts that you are left in probably the worst position ever if you fail and no other throw utilizes that particular set of movements, so you can't feint with it. Uki otoshi becomes an almost useless or impossible throw for randori or competitive purposes, so people don't work on it.  It's not without merit however as Jujiroll pointed out its great for exploring the principle of otoshi (the drop) as a means of throwing your opponent."
judo,2qldvr,M3atboy,3,Thu Jan 1 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"I don't see sumi-otoshi as a stand-alone throw. I think its real value is in teaching you a principal that you need to make several other throws work - tai-otoshi for example. When you look at it this way, it makes sense why such a difficult throw appears so early in the kata.  EDIT: Agh, I was thinking of uki-otoshi, but I think sumi-otoshi serves a similar purpose. Plus it can be used as a counter to an over-eager uchi-mata, so it's got that going for it."
judo,2qldvr,jujiroll,1 point,Tue Dec 30 11:52:07 2014 UTC,"That's an excellent point, I'd not quite thought of it that way."
judo,2qldvr,silvaphysh13,2,Wed Dec 31 15:02:57 2014 UTC,"The only times I was able to throw sumi otoshi in randori was as a counter against sloppy o soto gari attempts.  The throw is based on inertia to some extend, the kuzushi has two elements though. One element, that unbalances uke to his back, is stopping his upper body during his forward movement. Think of running into a low hanging branch with your chest: Your center of mass below keeps going forward and you fall on your back. The other element is pulling him sideways to the outer edge of his leading foot. As a result of both effects in place, his balance is broken to his back, his weight is resting on his leading foot and he cannot transfer it to the other one due to the sideway pull.  This is the setup for sumi otoshi, that  I work on at the moment. The description is for a right sided throw:  Tori and uke hold each other in ai yotsu, standard grip, except tori should move his lapel hand a bit up so he can apply effective pressure to ukes upper chest. Their stance is migi shizentai (both leading with their right foot). Tori now pulls uke by his lapel into stepping forward with his left foot, while taking two quick steps himself: The first to place his left foot next to the outer side of uke's right foot, the second places his right foot closely behind his left foot (yes, the legs are crossed now). Tori leans to his left and pulls uke sideways to the outer edge of his right foot. All this has to happen, before uke's left leg has passed his right leg and settled down. Now tori immediatly takes a third step: He moves his left foot to the left past uke with a wide step and lowers his center of mass abruptly. While all this happens, the pull on uke's lapel changes its direction until it has become a push into the opposite direction. All this requires a lot of coordination and the correct timing of each action. I still gotta practice this myself, but I think I found the right setup to begin with. A few more initial steps may be necessary for the flow of it."

judo,2qldvr,o_Mattador_o,2,Sun Dec 28 06:54:58 2014 UTC,"The way I always think about it is the collar arm is just used to soak up the slack in uke's arm and not to lift.  You want to drop, get uke draped over your lower back and then lift with your hips."
judo,2qldvr,DoorsofPerceptron,3,Sun Dec 28 13:37:16 2014 UTC,"You should really avoid ""lifting"" as much as you can. Its pretty contrary to the idea of maximum efficiency. Getting low and using momentum to get uke over you is a far more mechanically advantageous way to throw than picking the guy up."
judo,2qldvr,M3atboy,2,Mon Dec 29 13:51:34 2014 UTC,"Traditionally, if it doesn't finish with lifting or driving then it's seo toshi if it does finish with lifting or driving it's seo nage.  Of course it's never this simple so there is also a European seo toshi that is seo nage with tai toshi like legs.  Edit: Are we agreeing? I'm also saying if his arm is buckling it's probably because he's lifting with his arms, and he should drive his hips instead."
judo,2qldvr,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Mon Dec 29 14:03:28 2014 UTC,"Are we agreeing?   I think so?   I misinterpreted your comment to be about judo in general and not about seoi otoshi spefically.   Traditionally, if it doesn't finish with lifting or driving then it's seo toshi if it does finish with lifting or driving it's seo nage.   My understanding was that to be otoshi you need to use your own body weight dropping under their SOG as the primary factor of the throw.   But with Seoi nage you first bring them to your back then either over top of you or around your side. It can be done without a whole lot of lifting but requires a you to bend those knees."

Modern gis are cut more like suits and thus  hinder a classical morote seoi nage.  You have to make sure, that you can, while standing with your back to uke and looking forward, still can see your thumb of the hand holding his lapel from the corner of your eye. Otherwise you'll put yourself in a shoulder lock. The function of the arm at the lapel is to pull at uke's torso and pushing against his arm at the same time, as if you dragged something behind you by two ropes at the same time, with both ropes draped over one shoulder.  For a right sided throw, instead of grabbing the left lapel, grab the right lapel. If you still don't manage to enter the throw without hurting your shoulder, try to grab the upper part his right sleeve instead."

When I get back on the mat with some of the guys I know don't have any lingering injuries and can breakfall I'm just going to go for it in randori."

Imho an examiner should test if a judoka has understood the principle behind a technique and is able to apply it, not if he's able to mimic a specific ""textbook"" variant. But that's just me. I hoped to help him with that advise.  Uchi mata is no fave of mine as well. I am afraid to hurt my partners. Even Toshiro Daigo crushed his opponents testicle during the All Japanese Championships long. And my uchi mata is nowhere even close to anything those athletes can do."

judo,2qldvr,Kosoto_Gake,5,Mon Dec 29 20:34:35 2014 UTC,"Tai-otoshi. If I try it with any speed whatsoever, I just end up blocking them with my hip."
judo,2qldvr,jujiroll,5,Sun Dec 28 10:09:53 2014 UTC,Maybe you're coming too close to uke?  I only started to get tai otoshi when I really emphasised how wide I was going with my legs. You could also try coming in at an angle and not throwing uke straight forward.
judo,2qldvr,vipchicken,2,Sun Dec 28 13:07:06 2014 UTC,"I think tai otoshi is probably the worst taught and most misunderstood of the main competition throws. I've seen several high ranked instructors who just do not seem to get it at all. It doesn't help that, as a very hand dominant throw, it is very difficult to practice it slowly without an uke who knows exactly what they are doing.  It's now probably my favourite throw, but until it spontaneously clicked with me I couldn't do it at all. It's a very dynamic throw, and it was only once I got to the stage where I could occasionally do it in randori that I was then able to start practising it properly as a static throw."
judo,2qldvr,Aratoast,1 point,Tue Dec 30 11:49:11 2014 UTC,"I am having little luck with Tai-otoshi. It is my instructors favorite throw and he has a lot of good points but I find it tricky. I feel like it behaves differently to other throws in terms of distance between tori and uke, at the very least."
judo,2qldvr,M3atboy,2,Tue Jan 6 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"Harai goshi. I understand how to do it, I know why I'm not getting it right (I'm not putting my eight onto my supporting leg properly) but can I translate that into getting it right? Oh dear no."
judo,2qldvr,geocattes,1 point,Sun Dec 28 14:58:22 2014 UTC,You should train the Nage no kata version.
judo,2qldvr,M3atboy,1 point,Sun Dec 28 18:50:10 2014 UTC,Its tough to help because we need some specifics of what's not working before we can give some pointers. Video helps if you can.   when I learnt it. I had it described in the following way.   Think of O goshi. but instead of coming over nicely uke starts to slip off. So you throw you leg up to stop him from slipping. Its a little simplistic but gets the basic idea across.
judo,2qldvr,geocattes,2,Mon Dec 29 20:42:21 2014 UTC,"The throws that scare me a little I guess... I try not to be afraid but the full standing kata guruma terrifies me and I cling to tori like a rat on a sinking ship (luckily he has the sense not to throw me, though I know this is bad, it's just my natural response to it, since he's really tall). My professor recently showed it from the knees in an effort to make me less scared, and I swallowed my fears and let myself be thrown, and even did the technique a few times.   Akuri ashi burai isn't working for me really. I end up blocking the knee, which results in a takedown, but it isn't a proper technique..  Hane goshi is giving me trouble right now. I try to practice it in our 'rapid fire' rounds, but I always end up doing a nice harai goshi instead, since my foot placement is wrong... :("
judo,2qldvr,Geschichtenerzaehler,3,Mon Dec 29 15:27:20 2014 UTC,Text book kata guruma really shows how good your break falls are... you'll need to spend a lot more time getting thrown to overcome this. (personally I don't know anyone that likes being uke for the kata version)  For Okuri ashi harai it sounds like you are attacking in the wrong direction. The uke should be moving and then you accelerate his leg in the direction of travel so much so that his feet slip out from underneath him.  If you are blocking him contrary to the direction of his momentum you are probably doing either hiza guruma or sasae tsuri komi ashi.  Hane goshi is something I discovered by doing shitty uchi matas. Pretend your doing uchi mata but over rotate your hips so that your back is towards uke (not your side). This forces you to bend the leg if you want to keep it between uke's legs.   If you are outside the uke you probably need to focus on your foot placement. You are probably stepping too far across center.  Your foot should create a triangle with uke's feet.
judo,2qldvr,judokalinker,1 point,Mon Dec 29 16:02:40 2014 UTC,"To be honest once I was thrown from the knees one, I am a little more amenable to the standing one, but it's still quite scary. My breakfalls are mostly good I think, since I don't feel any pain from other big throws, just I guess there's something about being uke for kata guruma since you can see the ground. I found closing my eyes and trying to stay calm helped.   We did it moving and my professor said to do it fast, but I just didn't get it. I think you're right though about attacking the wrong leg. I was really frustrated in practice, so I think I'm going to try it again with your advice.  Thank you for the advice about hane goshi. I can do it as a slower drill or technique practice, but whenever I try more quickly, that's the result. The last part about making a triangle is really helpful! Thank you! :))"
judo,2qldvr,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Mon Dec 29 17:13:08 2014 UTC,"You could try this:  Tsuri komi goshi, right sided version:  You and your partner hold each other with the standard grip and both stand in hidari-shizentai (both with left foot forward).  Move your right hand up his lapel, until it is next to his left ear, not further. Now take a step back with your left foot and pull uke forward. Pull his right elbow upwards, while pushing with the base of your right palm sideways against his neck. The idea is to transfer his weight to his right foot and thus ""nail it in place"".  Now swing your left foot counterclockwise behind you and turn by 180° to 270° (until the back of your hips make contact with him) on your right heel while lowering yourself down. Don't try to push uke up, but try to ""push yourself down"" with the hand at the side of his neck. You don't even have to stretch your arm, that will happen by itself. He should already be falling when you rise your hips.  The elbow of your lapel hand remains in contact with the front of his chest. No need to put it in his armpit or use it as in a misguided morote seoi nage."
judo,2qldvr,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sun Dec 28 05:37:15 2014 UTC,"Perhaps you could add some information to this. While learning it, I had been told by many that tsuri komi goshi was best used when they hip into a morote seoi nage blocking the throw. Then you drop down and keep your arm extended. It makes sense to me,but is there any historical basis for this, or were they just speaking out of practicality."
judo,2qldvr,newhoza,1 point,Sun Dec 28 08:03:29 2014 UTC,"Okay, I'll write down what I know...  In the second group of the nage no kata, there are three koshi waza: uki goshi, harai goshi and tsuri komi goshi. The first technique was a favourite of Jigoro Kano, who used it pretty often on his students. His students soon developed two measures to evade his uki goshi: Stepping over or leaning back. Against the step over, Kano applied (invented?) harai goshi and against an uke leaning backwards, he applied (invented?) tsuri komi goshi. Tori extremely lowers his own hips and now has enough leverage to throw uke. So that's why these techniques are grouped together in the second set of the nage no kata.  That's how I know the story. Unfortunately I currently do not recall the source it stems from.  Anyway you may notice something weird. How is tori supposed to bring his hand to uke's upper lapel when it is already behind his back? This doesn't make sense, unless the switch from uki goshi to tsuri komi goshi happens, before tori puts his hand behind uke's back and turns. I assume some important details went missing in the story long ago.   Anyway, your suggestion, to switch from morote seoi nage to tsuri komi goshi might actually work. I never tried that though."
judo,2qldvr,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Sun Dec 28 15:11:15 2014 UTC,"In Nage no kata, Tori grips uke's collar at the back of the neck with the thumb inside from the start.   The arm is not straight but slightly bent during kake.  Tori also sticks his hip out to the side, slightly pass uke's leg."
judo,2qldvr,M3atboy,1 point,Sun Dec 28 16:26:57 2014 UTC,"There's quite a list of throws I gotta practice a lot more, but at least I grasped how many of them can work under certain circumstances. One go kyu no waza still eludes my understanding after many attempts, though:  Harai Tsuri Komi Ashi  And damn, I tried! I tried the version I was once shown, but that depended on uke jumping ... bah, I don't train under those ""masters"" anymore for a good reason ... I watched and rewatched footage of old masters over and over again. I read Daigo, Kano, Mifune... tried again... nada. I just can't make it work. sigh"
judo,2qldvr,internet_heyyo,1 point,Sun Dec 28 18:55:43 2014 UTC,"Ahhh, as a beginner, I find this interesting.  The two throws mentioned first, Morote seoi nage , and tsuri komi goshi, are both throws I saw through watching random videos (like this one, where I didn't know it was morote) getting myself excited for judo, that i thought looked so awesome that I wanted to do them right away haha.   I've tried morote, and... it did not go well. lol"
judo,2qldvr,kspirit,1 point,Sun Dec 28 07:36:46 2014 UTC,I've heard people say that morote is better suited for Asians as in the west we tend to have longer limbs.   I don't know how true that is but you certainly see more of the smaller guys doing it than anyone else and the Japanese and Koreans love it.
judo,2qldvr,Crussian,2,Sun Dec 28 12:56:34 2014 UTC,I always figured that had more to do with toilet design. The Asian squatting toilet enforces leg and hip flexibility from a young age that western sit toilets don't.

judo,2qjlpa,Hippocampus88,1 point,Mon Dec 29 11:05:16 2014 UTC,This throw would usually be called kata guruma.
judo,2qjlpa,WonkeyGiraffe,0,Thu Jan 1 12:17:13 2015 UTC,"It is understandable that they might bear similarities, however they differ substantially in principle. One can identify this particular throw by looking at the position you end up with once on your knees. If you freeze-frame the movement before uke is thrown you can see that you end up in a very 'seoi-nage' type of position. It becomes otoshi because uke is pulled down instead of lifted up. Otoshi is the act of pulling/throwing uke down, not the act of tori dropping down. Kata-guruma can be performed with one knee on the ground, without a doubt, but the leg is not grabbed and uke is not lifted up and around. That would be quite different. Hope that helps :)"
judo,2qjlpa,mrehohl,1 point,Mon Dec 29 15:49:48 2014 UTC,"My approach was, that this execution of seoi-otoshi has a very te-waza feel to it.   outside of the japanese terminology one could call it a ""reverse laats kata-guruma"" I'm not sure if anyone outside germany uses the term ""Laats-Rolle"" for a dropped kata-guruma that was popular 10 years ago.  the first throw in this video here is close to the Laats-Rolle, except Laats sat down and extended the far leg for the execution. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I0hsxyaf5M"

judo,2qhtno,Ryvai,0,Sat Dec 27 14:11:46 2014 UTC,I agree. In some of them he is not even sweeping at all.
judo,2qhtno,Gomez_AddamsXIII,1 point,Sat Dec 27 18:16:01 2014 UTC,This isn't a translation. But I imagine the general idea is that the rotation creates momentum. Momentum helps create kuzushi. And the rest follows.
judo,2qhtno,Geschichtenerzaehler,1 point,Sat Dec 27 09:32:38 2014 UTC,"Momentum plays a big role in this entry, but there's also some action/reaction based balance breaking (hando no kuzushi) involved:  He pushes uke backwards before he initializes the entry to create a counter push or at least make uke lean forward a bit. Then, when he moves and pulls to uke's left he ideally provokes him to lean/shift to his right."

judo,2qh230,jujiroll,2,Sun Dec 28 14:27:57 2014 UTC,"I have only watched the de-ashi-harai videos so far, but I guess I have no idea what I'm looking for...  Could you explain what makes the first bad example, well, bad?    Edit* thank you for posting this, btw. This is excellent.  Also, Katanishi is an amazing teacher. I speak maybe two words of French, but I understood his stuff beautifully."
judo,2qh230,Evolutionfire,3,Sun Dec 28 13:53:44 2014 UTC,"Just to make sure we are talking about the same video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFgPK3l5d9U  He throws twice. The first time, his hands do nothing to aid the throw. He positions himself in front of uke, turned somewhat to his left. This is neither the opitmal postion nor optimal angle for the throw. He sweeps the foot which seems to be settled down already (note the slight resistance). This is a little late. Timing is essential for a correct de-ashi-harai. The second time there is a litte more hand action, but no control. Also uke moves his leg into falling position and keeps it in the air. Uke basically throws himself. Tori's angle is all wrong again. His position is more as if he wanted to throw sasae tsuri komi ashi. He should stand to the other side of uke and sweep his foot from the heel and apply sufficient kuzushi with his hands.  ""Important technical details"" aside, the whole execution seems somewhat sloppy. It's actually not the worst technique video out there, but it kind of feels off."
judo,2qh230,AuspiciousApple,1 point,Sun Dec 28 16:48:46 2014 UTC,"I did notice in a lot of his videos, uke sometimes falling before the motion, like he's throwing himself in anticipation.  Thanks for the rest of the explanation.  Their videos come up quite frequently when I'm looking for techniques, so it's good to know what to look for."
judo,2qh230,reviling,2,Sun Dec 28 17:12:49 2014 UTC,"There are some big names to look out for. Footage of them is usually top notch material:  Kyuzo Mifune, Tokio Hirano, Isao Okano, Kenshiro Abbe, Hiroshi Katanishi, Jane Bridge, Yasuhiro Yamashita, Kosei Inoue, Go Tsunoda...  Japanese masters are usually technically excellent. Many high ranking French judoka as well.  The problem is ""reading"" the footage. Important details may remain unmentioned and hard to notice, because they are too subtle (Watch Mifune throwing sumi otoshi and you'll know what I mean).  By the way, the ""trick"" in de-ashi-barai is sweeping the foot in the right moment. That is, when uke transfers his weight onto it for a step (or hasn't fully taken his weight off it when taking it away). In other words there is a very short time window between the moment when he sufficiently stands on his other leg (sweeping the unweighted foot is now ineffective, because he doesn't need it to stand) and the moment when his foot is fully settled down (now it's too late, his foot bears his weight and can no longer be swept). Only inbetween de-ashi-harai can be applied. That's why it is so difficult."

While what he wrote isn't completely untrue, it is based on a lot of generalizations about Crossfit.  So, here are my generalization about Crossfit:   Doing Crossfit is better than doing nothing. Crossfit is stupid if the person doing it is stupid and does stupid things. Average office guy can benefit from Crossfit. Elite athletes have little or nothing to gain from Crossfit. Crossfit is stupidly expensive.   People break backs, pull muscles, and sustain ""other injuries"" from doing anything physical whether it's judo, bjj, motocross, or bodysurfing. Injuries are part of being alive and mobile as opposed to simply existing like a house plant on your couch or inside your cubicle.  There are ways to mitigate injuries whether it's Crossfit, judo or ballet."

Every time I ventured into a CF ""box"" I saw gawky teens, mid 20's athletes, and fat middle aged women thrown into the same room, given about a minutes instruction on proper form, then told to go balls out on a circuit. It doesn't make a lot of sense."

Plenty of cross fit gyms probably have knowledgeable trainers, but that is because there are good trainers out there, not because they are cross fit gyms.   Also, the entire idea of time based Olympic lifts Is dangerous as shit.  Talk to physical therapists. They love cross fit. Lots of patients"
judo,2qaxgp,judokalinker,-7,Sat Dec 27 01:08:44 2014 UTC,"Crossfit takes the relatively small dangers of weightlifting with good form, and then throws good form away.   False. Crossfit teaches proper form. Crossfit's SME on oly lifting is Mike Burgener. Part of Crossfit's curriculum is learning proper form using nothing but an unweighted PVC pipe or broomstick. http://www.crossfit.com/journal/library/53_06_Burgener_Warmup.pdf   You should never ever do Olympic and power lifts for time if you care about your backs and joints.    You should never lift with sloppy form regardless of time. Even when you do a pure strength workout like 5X5, there is definitely a element of time. You don't simply lift 5 reps over a 5 year period and expect any benefit if time wasn't important.  Like I stated before, Crossfit or ___________ is stupid if the person doing it is stupid and does stupid things.   The other things like kipping pullups are just stupid because it defeats the entire purpose of that exercise.   Kipping pullups are NOT meant to replace strict pullups or achieve the same purpose as strict pullups. It's a different exercise and movement with different goals!  http://breakingmuscle.com/crossfit/in-defense-of-the-kipping-pull-up"
judo,2qaxgp,H2Outbreak,4,Wed Dec 24 23:34:03 2014 UTC,"Gymnastic coaches have often criticized CrossFit for having poor progressions with upper body strength exercises. I believe it was Coach Chris Sommers of Gymnasticbodies.com that said that if we look at the elite of the elite CrossFit Games competitors, it's strange how for many years all they can muster are poor ring muscle ups and ring handstand push-ups.  The progressions in weightlifting and Olympic lifting have been adapted into CF but they have not properly adapted the gymnastic progressions that lead to advanced skills, which is why even kipping form can look ugly. Also, as a former CrossFitter myself, I think that they teach kipping movements way too early; especially for muscle ups. One should develop raw pulling strength to do 5-10 reps of strict muscle ups or dead hang (not packed) strict pull-ups before even attempting kipping movements. The connective tissue in the shoulders of the general, non-active individual is incredibly weak. Also, banded pull-ups are stupid.  Hope I added to the discussion without sounding too brass."

judo,2q70cc,artofgrappling,5,Tue Dec 23 18:02:56 2014 UTC,"Nice article. Judo and law enforcement share quite a bit of history.  There are many police-dojos of course. But beyond that, there's even an old judo kata that was specifically tailored for the purposes of law enforcement, the torite no kata:  http://de.scribd.com/doc/229256918/Torite-no-Kata-Judo-Japanese-Imperial-Police-1926#scribd  As you can see, it's full of arresting techniques, renkoho waza. There are entire technical selections for the police. Take this book for example:  http://www.amazon.com/Self-Defense-By-Judo-M-Harvey/dp/1258038668   This book is based on the kime-no-kata of the Kodokan and the specialized kime waza of the marunouchi police dojo in Tokyo.   Judoinfo.com also has a few pages dedicated to this topic:  http://judoinfo.com/renkoho.htm  Kodokan teachers were also involved in this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBwB1-GqjXk  A minor nitpick, I don't like this part of the article:   Kano eliminated the destructive jiu-jitsu techniques that would permanently maim training partners.   Kano did not accept inefficient techniques to be integrated into judo. Judo techniques were either just added the way they were, improved, newly invented and some were modified with the purpose of training safety. But nonetheless, judo techniques can be terribly dangerous, that includes those allowed in randori (throws, chokes, pins and arm locks), but also those that are still part of judo but not allowed in randori (strikes, kicks, leg locks, neck cranks, small joint locks ...).  In short: Kano didn't make the techniques safer, nor did he remove the dangerous ones, he made the way they were practiced safer.  EDIT: Made it a bit more readable."

As usual for older japanese self defense material, there's a lot of stuff executed from the seiza (kneeling position), which is uncommon in the west. Makes me wonder how common those gambling house brawls from those old samurai movies actually were...  I think at least for certain branches of the Japanese police a black belt in judo, karate or aikido is mandatory.

Okano for caught with it once. You can YouTube it.   Russian style o goshi works well.  Ko soto can be effective.  O ouchi is tough, but works well as a set up for uchi mata (or any forward throw), particularly as bjj players will push back hard.  I've had success with a circling tai otoshi.

judo,2q4ptw,kyoei,3,Tue Dec 23 03:41:31 2014 UTC,"I'm a big fan of tani otoshi. Trying to throw BJJers is a weirdly specific problem where guys know that they're in trouble, but their instincts are to drop their weight low or move their butt back away from whatever throw you're trying to hit. Combining a throw of your choice with tani otoshi ready to fire as soon as the BJJ guy backs off and gets low is pretty money and puts you in side control.  Caution: Learn how to do this one right or you could destroy your knee."
judo,2q4ptw,ward42,4,Tue Dec 23 06:32:42 2014 UTC,"Sacrifice throws aren't that useful in bjj unless you can consistently roll through to mount; both guys on the ground can get you ippon in judo but just leads to a scramble in bjj.  The foot sweeps are usually safe to try and you can definitely catch guys who aren't used to them. BJJ guys tend to fight hunched over on the feet to defend wrestling. It can be hard to get to the far leg with a ko uchi gari.  I look for o goshi/uki goshi from the hunched over position but I'm still learning the basics.  Off the top of my head, I think I see drop seoi nage most often from world class bjj guys. But anything you can get to work for you from positions you find yourself in is a good tool to have."

Sure, there's a chance he could double leg me and secure the takedown, but I'm pretty confident there's a better chance I would toemanage into mount off of his attempt.

judo,2q4ptw,DoorsofPerceptron,1 point,Wed Dec 24 16:39:05 2014 UTC,"There's a really bad single in there.  If someone grabs your front leg from an extreme side position, you can drive off the back leg and hook your front leg into the inside of their thigh.  From there you can stamp into your favourite hip throw or go straight for hanigoshi/uchimata. There's also some really nice spinning counters for if you get pulled into a turn. A good wrestler/ pickup  expert might land a single leg from there, but then they can land a single from anywhere.  This is a probably a better option than the single - the head's already in the right position. https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10202045716744977&pnref=story"

judo,2q4ptw,bear-knuckle,2,Wed Dec 24 18:19:58 2014 UTC,"Uchi-mata is an essential throw for BJJ. Most jiujiteiros fight from a wrestling stance and are always waiting on the shot. If you can glide underneath them and hit uchi-mata, you can take advantage of their forward lean and send them overhead for a hard fall and easy guard pass."
judo,2q4ptw,bear-knuckle,3,Tue Dec 23 03:42:40 2014 UTC,"I'd argue that hane and harai goshi are more likely to get you back taken than uchi mata. They require a slightly deeper angle and expose more of your body, while during uchi-mata directs the opponent slightly away from your body. It's also much harder to reverse the landing position from a low stance than from an upright one - it's a short fall with a hard landing. You also don't have to worry about sweeping that pesky back leg.  I'm better at harai goshi, but I hit uchi mata more often in BJJ."
judo,2q4ptw,ballsmontgomery,2,Tue Dec 23 04:05:00 2014 UTC,"I'm new to this subreddit but I'm a brown belt in Judo. Uchimata is another effective throw for BJJ and it combines nicely with ouchi/kouchi. one series I particularly like is uchimata to kouchi to osoto gari. All the foot sweeps are pretty safe, but if you are doing drop seoi nage you really have to off balance them first. its effective but you should practice it a lot, eventually you could even do a standing seoi which is much safer but more advanced. I'm doing the opposite of you as I mainly do Judo but now I'm going to the BJJ school near my university. I'm no expert when it comes to scoring in BJJ but it would seem to me that a failed sumi-gaishi would likely put you in half-guard. definitely just keep practicing and try things out live and see what works for you and what things you could modify.    EDIT Also Yoko Wakare is a great sacrifice technique that puts you right in side control. I use it from an overhook against someone who is leaning forward, it is very high percentage for me"
judo,2q4ptw,Geschichtenerzaehler,2,Tue Dec 23 04:14:18 2014 UTC,"Regarding ko-uchi-gari and o-uchi-gari: Great throws in every judoka's arsenal. As with any judo technique, there are various ways to execute them. Recently I successfully used ko-uchi-gari against a partner in BJJ. I reposition myself during these throws in a certain way I learned from watching Kenshiro Abbe: Step over in the moment your opponent hits the ground you find yourself in a great position past the guard:  http://youtu.be/PKXhK9OZltY?t=3m18s  I was once asked why I adopted that step-over. Take a look at Isao Okano's ko-uchi-gari here: http://youtu.be/INJoBxfBkRo?t=4m26s  That's about as perfect as it gets. In a judo competition this will give you an ippon, in the street it would likely destroy an opponent. In BJJ it gives you a few points and usually puts you in your opponents guard. Same with o-uchi-gari.  My point is: you may have to modify a few things to make them work (better) for BJJ."

O-Goshi, Harai Goshi would be more suitable options.  Tai Otoshi is a good throw, as can instantly lead to Juji Gatame. Same goes for O Soto Gari.  As for Ashi Waza: O Uchi Gari can land you in their full guard, so be careful there. Ko Uchi Gari is better, as instant knee slice and you are into Kesa Gatame De Ashi Barai is always a good one with their advanced foot.  Look to set up your throws with Sasae tsuri komi ashi as this will off balance uki for your main throw  Hope this gives you a few ideas! :-)"

I go for sweeps right away; I have a half guard game that I'm pretty happy with if a sacrifice throw fails. I haven't made it a point to try this particular sequence, but X guard seems like it would be right there after a failed sumi gaeshi or tomoe nage.  And of course, continue to your on your tachi waza."
judo,2q4ptw,Wilthuzada,1 point,Wed Dec 24 09:53:16 2014 UTC,"If you like sacrifice throws like tomoe nage and sumi gaeshi then get good at your DLR, reverse DLR, and x/single-x guards.  These are where you'll end up if you fail at off-balancing your opponent properly and they remain standing or only lose their balance for a second and then recover.    Best case scenario from a failed sacrifice throw is some kind of open guard or possibly closed guard if they fall into it.  Worst case scenario is they pass and you're in bottom side-control :/  Sacrifice throws are always a risk but they can pay off in a big way if you can hit them and get mount.  I think they're worth practicing for sure."
judo,2q5eek,vsk12,2,Tue Dec 23 05:59:01 2014 UTC,"Well the Shiai was replaced by the Yusho if I'm not mistaken. So the Shiai is slightly outdated. The cut, fit, length are non-compliant with the IJF's new gi regulations. It's not a bad gi, and a gi doesn't need to be IJF compliant to be a good gi obviously, but if it's not fitting as you'd expect, that might be why.  Could you explain what you think a competition gi should feel like to you? That might help give some more context."
judo,2q5eek,BootsLikeMafia,2,Tue Dec 23 07:00:37 2014 UTC,"The Shiai replaced the Ichiban which is why i thought it'd be good for competition.

judo,2q5eek,Kosoto_Gake,1 point,Tue Dec 23 07:46:57 2014 UTC,"The Yusho comp didn't replace the Shiai either. The only difference between the different Yushos is the type of cotton and where they were produced, apart from that they're essentially all the same gi.  The Shiai is a step below the Yusho, it's supposed to be a competitive club style gi rather than one that's used by national/international competitors. It's like the difference between an Adidas J700 to a J930 or a Fighting Films Black Label to a Superstar."

Single weaves are a single layer of cotton while double weaves are a double layer of cotton. Most people start off with a single weave, as it is cheaper and easier to move around in.

If you're Danish you might want a European cut gi which is more slim fitting than the Japanese style gis (ie. Mizuno, KuSakura etc). It all comes down to personal preference but personally I like European style gis.  If this is the case, then you want to be looking at: Fighting Films, Adidas, Essimo or many others.   You really have to look for yourself and make a decision on what you want. If I were you I wouldn't be buying a top end, IJF approved gi as you haven't been doing judo long enough to know whether you'll make the most of a gi like that.  However, if you love the sport then I'd definitely advise you to get a double weave gi over a single weave as they last infinitely longer (I still have my first double weave gi I bought and it's perfectly fine from being worn 2x a week)."
