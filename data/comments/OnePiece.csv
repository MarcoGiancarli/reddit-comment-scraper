OnePiece,3e2lx5,Pixelizedmario,21,Tue Jul 21 14:01:37 2015 UTC,that's a really cool thought. And I really like that idea. And god I hope we get to see it. I imagine if it is crocodile he wouldn't say much about it he would just suddenly get way harder to beat. Smoker however I see giving an epic speech after stomping down some wannabe.
OnePiece,3e2lx5,RandomHer03,5,Tue Jul 21 15:19:27 2015 UTC,Smoker and tashigi were people I definitely left out but thought about as I wrote it. I think smoker already has mountains of respect for Luffy and as does tashigi for the straw hats in general

But as of now all pirates must die, all who support pirates must die, and all who wish to get in his way will die."
OnePiece,3e2lx5,animelive,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:53 2015 UTC,akainu doesn't respect any pirate and I don't see that happening in the future either. This guy is already crafted as the main big bad guy of the marines.

Even if you do beat him he's not going to stop. You can't just throw him into impel down, you have convince him that what he's doing is just as bad as pirates. As of now sakazuki/akainu maybe one of the most interesting villains because we don't know why he thinks like this. And you can't just punch that out of him either you truly have to break who he is to beat him."
OnePiece,3e2lx5,animelive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:11 2015 UTC,I feel like he will probably be killed by the end of the series. His character is too extreme to be alive in the end. We will probably see why he believes what he believes but I doubt he will change his morals which he has hold to for so long. He is just to extreme to feel any connection to and has been since we saw him in the flashback of Ohara.
OnePiece,3e2lx5,cbih,10,Tue Jul 21 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"With Crocodile, at least, someone calling Luffy weak, is worse than calling him weak. It's a personal thing rather than respect. If you call the guy who beat him weak, you're saying that Crocodile is even weaker."

Garp, Sengoku, Tsuru, Z, and probably the pre-TS admirals as well. Roger was, regardless of his legacy, a very respectable person.

OnePiece,3e1yjk,Lirux,13,Tue Jul 21 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"I get why, but you know that that's kinda out of reach, right? I feel like Oda has made it clear by storytelling that the Yonkou are simply out of reach. I think that the next part of the story is a lot more about aliances. I hardly see Luffy himself beeing able to stand toe to toe with any of the Yonkou. I get it, Doffy is really strong and we have a lot of reasons to believe Luffy could've done more if he wasn't so tired, or that he might still have some things up his sleeves, but i hardly thing he's way Stronger than Doffy, while it's a fact that Doffy is clearly way under Kaido's level, and that he completely fears him. Well, that's what i think, at least..."
OnePiece,3e1yjk,Dinh0w,7,Tue Jul 21 11:53:50 2015 UTC,"we actually have no idea how far below kaido's level doffy was. Doffys crew really wasnt that strong. It stands to reason that kaidos crew is way stronger than doffys. Which is why doffy fears him. Its not like doffy is completely stupid.   Its also not like most of the strawhats went all out. The only ones who did were usopp and luffy(allegedly).  Its more likely kaido will defeat luffy, but lose the rematch, than outright be unstoppable.  Now as for zoro beating kaido. No way. If law couldnt beat doffy, zoro can't beat kaido. Its obvious oda leaves the main villain of the arc for luffy, even when the other characters have greater motives and drive to defeat said villain."
OnePiece,3e1yjk,rmw6190,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"This hasn't always happened. Zero defeated captain Morgan, and Sanji beat Duval. Although, I don't ever see anyone but Luffy defeating the Yonko (besides the other supernovas)."

OnePiece,3e1yjk,Piro987,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:38 2015 UTC,What if he's so strong that the whole crew would be forced to fight him at once? Or at least just the Monster Trio vs Kaido and Zoro ends up finishing him off or something.
OnePiece,3e1yjk,Manixxz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:45 2015 UTC,"Doffy is in all likelihood not just weaker than Kaido, but 2 whole ranks below (if we can tier OP power). He was clearly weaker than Aokiji during their brief fight, and considering the fact that Kaido is supposed to be only slightly less powerful than Whitebeard (of whom proved himself to be far above even Akainu, himself having beaten Aokiji), then it would stand to reason that Kaido is much more powerful than Doffy."
OnePiece,3e1yjk,the_limbo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"I don't see how breaking out of being frozen shows that Doffy was ""clearly weaker than Aokiji"" and people need to stop saying that Whitebeard was far above Akainu. Akainu got hit twice and the next time we see him he is back up and going after Luffy while destroying everyone in his path. Before that, every time we saw them fight, they seemed pretty evenly matched."

I wouldn't say ""clearly weaker"". But yes, not as strong.   I think Doflamingo is also smart enough to not enter dumb fights. He knows when his opponent is stronger and he cannot win, and so prefers to leave rather than fight.  I mean.. he whooped Smoker's ass like it was nothing and took control of Jozu during the WB war. Those two guys are not weaklings."

However, i agree that Sanji and Zoro probably won't take out yonkous on their own."

OnePiece,3e1yjk,TiggerTheTiger1999,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"But the fact luffy stated that he wanted to defeat the 4 yonkou to law; I think is signal to luffy being ready for them. He'll slowly show his tricks up his sleeve. I also know luffy is always confidently saying all these things. But I doubt luffy would need other's assistance to finish off the yonkou. He is going to be the king of the pirates right? Surely, that has to be legendary! He'll have as many followers or people around who'd love to help him out [the type of alliances I see] But these people will take care of the significant ""others"" in those yonkou bastions!

OnePiece,3e1yjk,WantedtoPostThis,2,Tue Jul 21 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"The silhouette figure in the recent chapter is Kaido's palace/fortress in Wano Kuni.   Kaido overthrew the then reigning Shogun, Ryuma, and  kicked out the royalty related to Ryuma, one of them being Momonosuke.  Momonosuke is based off the Japanese folk tale of Momotaro. Which tells of a (peach) boy getting together a gang of a friendly animals (monkey, pheasant, dog) to take on a Oni (demon king) and it's demon affiliates. Momo infiltrates the Oni's fortress, beats some underlings, and eventually takes down the Oni in a collective effort. Similar events will translate in the Wano arc.  Kaido's DF is a mythical zoan: Oni Oni no mi. Making Kaido the strongest creature in the world, along with being a demon king. the hundred beast epithet is related to Kaido's appearance - Oni are represented to have characteristics of animals."

OnePiece,3dyxgh,Sstargamer,18,Mon Jul 20 19:10:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's from a nintedo ds game called jump ultimate stars
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Hidrocalido,10,Mon Jul 20 19:17:06 2015 UTC,The sprites are from Jump Ultimate Stars. The game is basically smash bros but with Jump characters. An absolute blast to play but japan only.  Please understand.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,gustamos,4,Mon Jul 20 20:37:17 2015 UTC,The perks of having a DS Rom loader. This game is a blast indeed. I just randomly click stuff in the menus until a fight starts.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,felixar90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:57 2015 UTC,Basically.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,gustamos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:17 2015 UTC,I ordered it from japan. It was before i found out about Roms. I had to read all the instructions on gamefaqs to figure out what to do and where to go.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,ColHunterGathers,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:54 2015 UTC,DS games are region-free. Why use a ROM?
OnePiece,3dyxgh,undertoe420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:22 2015 UTC,"Because even if it's region free, I would still have to order it from oversea.  Also, most of my DS games are roms, because the closest store stocking DS games was a 3 hours drive from my home, and we would only go there a handful of times per year. And they had a very limited selection of games too. They had all the shitty cashgrab games (e.g. Cory in the House) and none of the good games.  But all my 3DS games are legit, because buying and downloading them is more convenient than having to buy a rom loader, even tho I have a car now."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,felixar90,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:04:52 2015 UTC,Why can't you order games online?
OnePiece,3dyxgh,undertoe420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:34:01 2015 UTC,"Cause I didn't have a credit card or anything to pay with. Also I didn't know you could order games online. The reason I had a rom loader in the first place is because someone gave it to my dad at work.  Also I'd have to use a wheelbarrow to carry all my games, when they all fit on a single micro-SD card."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,felixar90,-6,Tue Jul 21 01:42:01 2015 UTC,"So you stole a bunch of stuff you felt entitled to because you couldn't buy it, enjoyed it, and then decided to never go back and pay for it even after you could buy it? You're a thief."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,undertoe420,3,Tue Jul 21 02:47:08 2015 UTC,"Well, most of these games aren't even for sale anymore. Best I can do is buy them used, which isn't paying the developers anyway. But I only ever pirated 5 PC games (back when Steam didn't exist and PC games required a CD inside the drive) and I bought them all when I got a credit card.  (And an couple more games I got like 10 years after the game was released, like Myst and Warcraft 2 on a burned CD from my dad's friend)  Btw, Im not the one who downvoted you. IMHO you totally have a point and I always felt bad about doing this."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,felixar90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:58 2015 UTC,I wish Zoro was in J Stars Victory Vs. they could have easily put him in instead of Ace.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Centipedian,11,Mon Jul 20 21:06:09 2015 UTC,Luffy post-timeskip vs zoro pre-timeskip not fair
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Sergiirk,27,Mon Jul 20 21:50:01 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, who would win in a legit fight? Assuming in a parallel dimension of the One Piece world, Zoro and Luffy never met, but happen to have levelled up to the same strength they're currently at and must fight each other. I think Zoro would win, although it would be quite a battle. Swords beats rubber, imo.  edit: sure, why not downvote because I'm adding to discussion. Hope you feel satisfied, whoever you are."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,petalidas,30,Mon Jul 20 20:23:02 2015 UTC,Imo zoro wouldn't be able to keep up with Luffy's speed. I think Luffy would win by a longshot actually if he used all of his power.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,ArabIDF,11,Mon Jul 20 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen Zoro use all his power. Luffy would probably win anyway, but I'd imagine they're pretty close."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,SuperBattleFranky37,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:47:45 2015 UTC,"Gear 2nd + Conqueror's Haki + Armament.  Luffy staggers Zoro but doesn't ko him, rushes up to him with a Hawk Rifle and pierces Zoro's gut. Zoro dies due to damage of the internal organs (Hawk Rifle cuts the tubes in his gut and then sears them shut.)"
OnePiece,3dyxgh,lexluther4291,14,Mon Jul 20 23:01:39 2015 UTC,Haki beats sword though.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,misfitzl,4,Mon Jul 20 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"But it's not as if Luffy can go full-body armor haki. Sure, he has observation haki, but so does Zoro. With Zoro's speed and strength along with 3 swords, it's hard to say whether Luffy would be able to activate haki in the right places to prevent being cut. This aint a rock-paper-scissors contest."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Kashmir33,19,Mon Jul 20 20:32:54 2015 UTC,Based roughly on the ratings of the CP9 enemies defeated in Enies Lobby and assuming they both have a roughly equal rate of growth during the timeskip my votes on Luffy.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Kashmir33,8,Mon Jul 20 20:42:57 2015 UTC,Uh.. Spoiler Manga I think it's out of the question that Luffy is stronger and faster than Zoro. Also the ability to use conquerers haki is definitely a huge advantage for Luffy.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,lexluther4291,4,Mon Jul 20 22:40:13 2015 UTC,Ever heard of a spoiler tag? Not all of us read the manga
OnePiece,3dyxgh,katalysis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:41 2015 UTC,oh shit my bad. I completely forgot about that.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,overkill136,2,Mon Jul 20 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"Can he not use haki defensively? I don't think he has before, but does that necessarily mean he can't? /r/whowouldwin would be able to answer this for you more legitimately than I could, but my money is still on Luffy by a slim margin.   (I brought you back to +1 btw)"
OnePiece,3dyxgh,katalysis,5,Mon Jul 20 20:41:20 2015 UTC,Luffy's haki > Zoro's haki. Zoro won't be able to cut Luffy.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,felixar90,5,Mon Jul 20 20:43:59 2015 UTC,It's already been shown in the series that sufficient force can overcome CoA Haki.  If Hody was able to pierce through Luffy's CoA - it's not unreasonable to think that Luffy wouldn't be able to just tank Zoro's strongest attack.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Rigo77,11,Mon Jul 20 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree, but for any attack of Zoro's that Luffy can't fully tank, there is at least an equal if not stronger attack from Luffy that Zoro can't tank.  If it comes down to it, if one is arguing that Zoro will win in a Zoro vs. Luffy matchup in a Shonen fiction, then Zoro would be the main character, or Rayleigh was stronger than Gol D. Roger. The possibility is there, but doesn't make a lot of sense."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,overkill136,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:53 2015 UTC,"Whatever happens, the fight will probably fully devastate whatever island they're on. Probably not to the extend of Akainu vs Aokiji, but it guess it could level most of the buildings and mountains"
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Dandy-Guy,0,Mon Jul 20 22:46:16 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about when hody bit Luffy on like the neck shoulder because right after he bit him Luffy says ""damn didn't put haki on fast enough"" or something along those lines."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,angryspacemahreen,4,Mon Jul 20 21:27:45 2015 UTC,Just going by mangastream scans.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Dandy-Guy,0,Mon Jul 20 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"Luffy stated that his Haki isn't strong enough to block swords, sharp edges, very pointy things. His Haki is good but not good enough."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,angryspacemahreen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"Uh no. Not the same thing. He blocked swords, maces, spears with his haki. He just said that he's not good enough to block a haki imbued sword. Not the same thing."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,supreeth2812,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:15 2015 UTC,"http://bato.to/read/_/270414/one-piece-digital-colored-comics_v65_ch641_by_no-group/9 On this page bottom row Luffy says ""Armament Haki can block blunt attacks, but it's not good enough for this kind of damage."" The kind of damage from Hodys teeth was sharp and pointy. Luffy Haki can't block sharp and pointy. Sword are sharp and pointy... so Luffy can't block swords. Show me a manga page where he is shown blocking a sharp sword with Haki or he says that he block swords with Haki."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,BushWhacker47,0,Tue Jul 21 12:11:46 2015 UTC,"You misinterpreted. He said ""this kind of damage."" That ""damage"" isn't about the type of attack that Hody is doing, it's about the scale of it. Hody's attack is way too strong for Luffy thus his armament haki is not working well. If it were a random thug with a sword it would definitely work.  And also, why would Luffy even bother using armament haki if he can't even block a random thug's sword with it? Armament haki is the same for everyone, the only difference between everyone is its strength. Luffy is made out of Rubber which is not particularly tough against swords, against sharp objects he's just a normal human, most people interpret this as some sort of weakness, but he's weak to piercing stuff as much as any other person, like Shanks, he's not specifically weak to it.  Luffy blocked Doflamingo's punches, Chinjao's headbutt, and many other attacks much stronger than most people's sword attacks and yet you claim he cannot block swords even though people who have less skill with armament haki than Luffy can? It's not like blocking swords has a specific trick to it, it's all about your control over your Haki and its strength, thus Luffy can, and will block swords."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,ScarRed_Tiger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:02 2015 UTC,Agreed with the dandy-guy. Its clearly written in the manga that he can only he can only defend against blunt attack not the other. Do you not know the meaning of blunt?he says he cant block the opposite which is sharp attacks just like the hordy bite! And if you talk about the strength of the attack i think Zoro Sword attack would be easily stronger than Hordy bite.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,AwesomePocket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:52 2015 UTC,I'm confused? Didn't luffy block viola's sword at the very end chapter 789 with Haki? cause that for sure is sharp. I believe angryspacemahreen post to be more realistic.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,makemunny,4,Tue Jul 21 16:22:53 2015 UTC,Nami. The answer is always Nami.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,unnusual_art,5,Mon Jul 20 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"If they're on the same level, sure, I think Zoro would win. But I think Luffy's just on a higher level. His speed, power, and haki superiority would likely edge out whatever advantage Zoro's swords have."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Captain-Turtle,3,Tue Jul 21 02:29:34 2015 UTC,"I think before Spoiler was revealed Zorro would have won, but now that it has there's no chance he could keep up."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,craznazn247,3,Tue Jul 21 02:28:25 2015 UTC,That was Luffy's time skip power up. We haven't seen what Zoro learned yet so I think it's too early to say that.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Captain-Turtle,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"Zoro should.  There was a /r/whowouldwin battle on it and it was kinda decided that Zoro would be stronger, all I remember is that Zoro's durability was insane, let me try and find the post.  Also there was a good youtube comment (I know) that was explaining why he was stronger too, like how Luffy needs Gear 2 to beat someone zoro can go normal against with no haki, and how that monica person was so much more scared and did so much worse in her fight with zoro then she did against luffy and a bunch of other points.  edit: found it It's cool how they even made the fight into a story, look at the top comment and the reasoning behind it."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,vivvav,4,Tue Jul 21 01:03:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't read it but I do think Zoro has better durability than Luffy. The one instance where this factor was directly compared was when Kuma used his ability to transfer all of Luffy's injuries (which were fatal), and Zoro was still conscious after receiving all of it.  Also, we've seen Luffy at his limit. We haven't seen Zoro defeated to the extent Luffy has just yet. I think in the realm of raw power Luffy wins, but a swordsman vs a rubber man gives him quite an edge (unintended pun)."
OnePiece,3dyxgh,connormantoast,2,Tue Jul 21 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"You should, it's a cool play on how it would go, like it has the people in character and it feels like a one piece thing.  Yeah, he was conscious, and how you know after a fight the characters become strong, I'm sure after that experience Zoro became wayy more durable than he was before he got hit by that. Although Luffy did go through a lotttt of pain in the impel down and marine ford arc.  Also it's cool to notice the damage between Luffy's elephant gun with Haki in it, compared to Zoro's slashes with Haki when they fought that big stone guy in Dressrosa"
OnePiece,3dyxgh,Blackierobinsin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:22:41 2015 UTC,I was hoping Nami would come in and hit both of them.
OnePiece,3dyxgh,katalysis,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:19 2015 UTC,If there is one with luffy vs usopp I would be so happy.

OnePiece,3e2py8,FanEu7,8,Tue Jul 21 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"Fishman Island is easily the worst in my opinion...   I think its exploration of racism was kinda heavy handed and weak (it would have been more interesting if Hody had a genuine grievance against humans instead of just being a jack-ass).    But this stuff is very hard to get right (complex issue and all) and I would have easily forgiven the arc if it had been better in other areas like the fights or the comedy but both were lack luster.  I get that the whole point was to show just how superior the Straw Hats were to the enemies after the time skip and there was the occasional cool moment but mostly it just resulted in a lack of tension.  Sanji's nosebleed thing was milked to death, Caribou wasn't that amusing and I can't help but agree with Luffy's original assessment of Shirahoshi.  But thats more than enough griping from me it's all behind us now and Punk Hazard/Dressrosa have gone on to prove One Pieces general excellence."
OnePiece,3e2py8,OpenCube,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:46 2015 UTC,The Top 2 favourite Saga's were clearly the CP9 and Whitebeard Saga's  Lets see what the least favourite's are!
OnePiece,3e2py8,SamuraiDDD,3,Tue Jul 21 14:37:09 2015 UTC,Personally I wasn't a big fan of Skypeia because when I was watching it here in the states on old Toonami there was a lot of stuff going on with broadcasting issues and I never got to fully complete it. I just read the manga at that point and went on.
OnePiece,3e2py8,HansVader,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:49 2015 UTC,"It was the Fishman Island Saga, because it was right after the re-union of the crewmembers where they supposed to be unstoppable with their new training. Well, they felt kinda weak during the saga."
OnePiece,3e2py8,RandomHer03,7,Tue Jul 21 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the felt weak, there were plenty of moments when they could have wrecked Hody's shit, other circumstances just kept getting in the way. It's really quite impressive that Oda can still make someone who is pretty weak challenging to fight.  Not to mention we got that sweet taste of all the strawhats new powers. I think it was perfectly fitting to send us off into the new world."
OnePiece,3e2py8,TheErrMasterKush,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:10 2015 UTC,It's just the disadvantage of water that made them seem weak. I didn't feel that they were weak it's just that they had the fight severely tipped in the wrong favour making it difficult.

OnePiece,3dz905,FanEu7,42,Mon Jul 20 20:04:50 2015 UTC,Let's not forget oda thought the series would be done in 5 years when he began.  I'd take this with a grain of salt.
OnePiece,3dz905,Oedipustrexeliot,32,Mon Jul 20 21:11:44 2015 UTC,30% can be a long time for a manga series look how long the final arc of Naruto lasted.
OnePiece,3dz905,CanadianJudo,19,Mon Jul 20 20:14:06 2015 UTC,If we are at like chapter 800 and that is 70% then 1150 is 100%. Let's say we get like 42 chapters per year (might be lower because of all the breaks oda takes) that leaves 30% at 345 chapters or 8.2 years to finish the whole series.
OnePiece,3dz905,LiterallyKesha,15,Tue Jul 21 05:31:32 2015 UTC,Oda is putting in 110% /s
OnePiece,3dz905,WantedtoPostThis,4,Mon Jul 20 23:23:13 2015 UTC,He is awake 125% of the time that he should be.

OnePiece,3dz905,iCokahola,9,Tue Jul 21 04:04:45 2015 UTC,It doesnt sound like he actually knows and was just guessing. My guess would be like 65%.

OnePiece,3dz905,ArabIDF,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:05 2015 UTC,I did the math (roughly) and 70-80% done means OP would end around 2020. I'd be okay with that.

I think about 5% has past since then maybe a little more, but 5% is a nice round number. I think though when something big is revealed it will feel like more has happened even if it happens over a shorter time. Say defeating a Yonko. I feel like that would feel like more plot advancement there then the whole of the New World so far even though it would be shorter. Any big reveal like Vega Punk or Dragon would also really feel like the series is pushing along."
OnePiece,3dz905,nerdofalltrades,3,Mon Jul 20 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"well here is what a think:  Inside the universe, in the last 240 chapters less than week happened (after the timeskip). They went to fishman island and then dressrosa.  Assuming we get 2 more arcs of simliar lenght there just doesn't seem to be enough room to conclude everything + power up in time. But I mena only time will tell"
OnePiece,3dz905,Swarlsonegger,30,Mon Jul 20 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"I have nothing but the utmost respect for Oda. It's obvious that he is a talented writer but he still put so much effort(more than anybody else according to suguru, which i believe) into writing his manga and satisfying his readers. Some writers out there have talent but doesn't have the effort to pull through(cough, togashi, cough), some has the other way around. Oda have both. To think that a guy who earns 24million usd a year still works as much and only sleeps around 3 hours a night just to perfect his craft for the sake of his readers is insane!

OnePiece,3dz905,Aluxer,25,Tue Jul 21 12:47:41 2015 UTC,"If you consider the timeskip (~chapter 600) as the halfway point , then about 1200 chapters has to be the end right?  So, the 200 chapers that has passed so far from the timeskip is 2/12 of the entire story. Add that to the 6/12 of the timeskip and you get 8/12. If we are 8/12 of the way to the end, then we are 66.66% done. 70% is not a bad guess, especially if you think it'll end before chapter 1200."

I am happy that his editor confirms what we've known about Oda's dedication to his work all this time, but it's also worrying to hear he gets only 2-3 hours of sleep. Lack of sleep can contribute to illness and stress on the body, so I hope he's not overworking himself too much. Also love that tidbit about how he treats younger, newbie coworkers as equals - how humble and approachable despite his success and fame. Major props.  Also, it's funny to hear that he also has a thing for figurines considering I used to be equally into collecting One Piece figures myself. Heheh."

It'll be devastating if he comes down with cancer or some other serious ailment because his body hasn't been able to repair itself properly for such a long time.

OnePiece,3dz905,krunske,7,Mon Jul 20 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"I just feel that being 60% into the story seems kinda small compared to all the stuff that is already planned to happen kind of. We're going to encounter Big Mom and Kaido. We'll be going to Zou and Wano where the encounter to Kaido probably is. But also what about the foreshadowing of Usopp going to Elbaf? Shouldn't we be going to that island as well? And this is just stuff we already know is bound to happen. There is of course stuff we just don't know about yet. I feel two emperors will take atleast 300 chapters to finish. And then what? We go from defeating two emperors to finding One Piece? And then what about the last and final war that will shake the world? That will also at least take like 300 chapters dont you think?   My point is yeah I agree with you. Oda seems to underestimate how much left there is. He is like most other authors/creators that tend to think they don't have that much left, but as they progress they realize ""oh I need to add this and that"" and it adds up in the end. Just look at George RR Martin right now. Back in the 90's George thought he would only make three books. Then he thought he would write all his other books in a much faster pace than he really did. And now he is hinting that there will be more than just TWOW and ADOS coming, that there may be another book after that again. sigh"

OnePiece,3dz905,izanami94,4,Tue Jul 21 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"I've got a theory about how it's going to wrap up faster than we think: kaidou and big mum are going to fight each other and somehow cancel each other out. Evidence: They were introduced nearly at the same time, luffy is too weak to beat a yonkou and they're already hunting them (or kaidou will be in a short time).

OnePiece,3dz905,katalysis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:07 2015 UTC,"If the first 70% took 18 years, then the remaining 30% will be roughly 7.7 years."
OnePiece,3dz905,ghmorello,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"Woah, so Dressrosa maybe the 3/4th part of the story.  So, maybe the ""One Piece will end at 1000 chapters"" rumor could be true."
OnePiece,3dz905,dooperco,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:11 2015 UTC,The way Oda likes to aim close to 100 chapters mark makes me think chapter 1000 will be the start of the final arc. Much like chapter 700 was the start of Dressrosa. And similarly it could go on for 100 chapters as well. So my guess would be around chapter 1100 for the end.
OnePiece,3dz905,ghmorello,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:27 2015 UTC,Imagine if the final arc was 200 chapters instead of 100 chapters?
OnePiece,3dz905,dooperco,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm 100 chapters was pretty fatiguing, I cant imagine 200 chapters or 4 years of one arc.  But, it would be the last arc, and that would mean a lot of epic shit was going down so I don't know."

OnePiece,3e1g64,190x190,13,Tue Jul 21 08:26:47 2015 UTC,Agreed - Oda is great at using links to older chapters (Seekings for example) but its the other way around most of the times. He isnt foreshadowing but makes clever usage of already introduced characters.
OnePiece,3e1g64,WatteOrk,3,Tue Jul 21 09:07:10 2015 UTC,its misused mainly
OnePiece,3e1g64,derzigo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"Well if this does end up come true, I would definitely consider Oda using Mr. Prince earlier in the series foreshadowing. So, you know, its all about perspective :p"

OnePiece,3e1g64,pddpro,2,Tue Jul 21 07:20:21 2015 UTC,"actually rebecca is next in line after riku, before viola. Thats because her mother is violas older sister. Of course they dont have to follow that rule though, and one piece world rules of succesion could differ from ours"

OnePiece,3e1g64,sora677,2,Tue Jul 21 11:35:27 2015 UTC,"I understand the criticisms of her, but to me, living with her father doesn't have to imply that it's on Dressrosa.  She still wants to protect her father when he's down, she was just out of her league in Dressrosa's battle the same way Luffy was at Marineford.  But Luffy sucked it up and got stronger anyway.  I'm sure people on the crew would be willing to work with her to become stronger, and her father could come along by representing Dressrosa in the alliance against Kaido."

Some of the default presentations of the results are a bit messy, so it could do well with some cleanup. All the answers with custom inputs would have to be manually classified, for instance, and the list of countries and ages could be sorted by occurence.  One of the most interesting results I see at a glance, is the high rating of Skypiea arc as favourite (it's currently third, after W7/EL and Impel/Marine). That arc seems to be getting a lot of flak during discussions, probably due to no new crewmembers being added, but it still turns out pretty popular. It's also my personal favourite due to the high amount of comic relief, so I'm happy for the results.  Edit: Forgot to say that I think this was a great initiative! Also, maybe add something like ""Favourite non-strawhat character"" as the current ""favourite character"" has some potential overlap with the ""favourite strawhat?"" (Don't replace the ""favourite character"" though, as it's interesting to see how many actually have strawhats as favourites). There could also be a question about how long people have followed OP, to see if that impacts the other answers."

Also, to which you already pointed out, he has the same down facing wings as birkans.  I don't think he fought enel tho. I think he was just a survivor who fell from birka and created a pirate crew due to his anger to whoever destroyed his own city. His mission might even be to hunt down enel since he first went to raijin island as his first destination in new world."
OnePiece,3e05y0,dartveyner,4,Mon Jul 20 23:43:29 2015 UTC,"That could be true. But it just seems weird for Oda to single out and mention a ""powerful sky knight""."
OnePiece,3e05y0,eldinswe,7,Mon Jul 20 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different Sky islands aside both Birka (the name of the Viking Capitol in Sweden around year 900 btw lol) and Skypiea. And if I remember correctly, it has been said that Urogue is from neither of those two."
OnePiece,3e05y0,constar90,9,Mon Jul 20 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right. There are a lot of Sky Islands but not all of the inhabitants of these islands have wings on their back. For example the weather island where Nami got sent to during the timeskip.  But there are only three distinct races with wings on their back. If you look at Enel's trip to the moon. It's shown that there were three races that originated from the moon and came down to Earth (the three races being Shandian, Skypiean and Birkan). Only these three races have wings on their back and only two of these races ended up settling in the sky (Skypiean and Birkan). The Shandians ended up on the ground.   So I thought it was reasonable to think that Urouge was Birkan and the one Oda was referring to in the link above. Since he's definitely not Skypiean and you could see that he's not by the way the wings look. All three races have different looking wings and Urouge's wings look Birkan."

OnePiece,3e05y0,Sstargamer,3,Tue Jul 21 05:28:54 2015 UTC,"Neither of the links you posted does a good job in translating that panel.  As far as the ""sky knight"" part goes, I would say the online translation is more correct than the picture you linked.  Here is the Japanese panel.  The original line, followed by transliteration and a fairly literal translation is:   ビルカにも屈強な空の戦士がいたそうだがエネルの前では意味すらない!!! Biruka ni mo kukkyō na sora no senshi ga itasō da ga Eneru no mae de imi suranai It's said that there were also strong sky warriors in Birka, but they were meaningless in front of Enel.   The key phrase here is sora no senshi (空の戦士).  Senshi means ""warrior/soldier/fighter."" Gan fall uses the title sora no kishi (空の騎士; just ctrl+f that on the wiki)..  Kishi means ""knight."" The Sora no in both of them means ""of the sky.""  It's also worth noting that his grammar indicates he's reporting hearsay, not something he saw first hand or that was absolute fact.  Given Gan Fall's singular title ""knight of the sky,"" I would say the official translation made a mistake in repeating that phrase when the original words were different.   Now, none of this mean's your theory is completely wrong. But, if it were to be true, Uruoge was just a ""warrior of the sky"" (likely one of many - plurals are often ambiguous in Japanese), not the same sort of ""Knight of the sky"" that Gan Fall was."

OnePiece,3e05y0,grouchylady,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:09 2015 UTC,"But I tend to think the first link is the more accurate translation   The earlier volumes have some pretty blatant mistakes/questionable decisions though iirc. I don't know when Stephen Paul (the current, more reliable translator) started working for Viz, but pretty sure it was after this arc. Without seeing the raws myself, I'd guess it's an ambiguous line (plural/singular isn't always obvious in Japanese). But I'd also guess that specifying it as ""sky knight"" is a mistaken assumption -- seemed to me that term is culturally Skypiean and/or reserved for Gan Fall/Ganfor?  I do also seem to remember Urouge being explicitly from a different sky island from the ones we've seen, but scanning the wiki, it seems unconfirmed, and actually I wouldn't be surprised if he also is from Birka/Bilka because of the pseudo-Buddhist theme going on with their designs/names."

However, he got big in the community because for like a decade his translations were the only good ones that existed. And, if I recall correctly, he translated it similarly to the Viz version."
OnePiece,3e05y0,tsukai_sute,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. Since I got into the series relatively late, I'm not familiar with his unofficial translations (do you know if they're still around somewhere? I've been wanting to look them up but either never got around to it or assumed they'd been taken down), but I knew him from his other MangaScreeners work.  If the Viz version is correct, I do think there's a pretty strong case for the Urouge connection. I actually like the Viz translations overall, even the inconsistent early stuff, but I don't fully trust the earlier volumes because I distinctly remember a few scattered lines that significantly change the meaning/context of what's going on despite not necessarily being ""incorrect""."

OnePiece,3e35ut,Zoro_threeswordstyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"No he wouldnt be sent to impel down or get a bounty, he is the hero of the marines, the only man who almost killed roger several times. His influence and power single-handedly helped the marines uphold their reputation and honor. A lot of people were sent to impel down because of him. He was offered position of admiral multiple times. He is respected by the marines more than sengoku or akainu. Even if after garp beat up akainu, akainu became fleet admiral he wouldnt be able to do a thing against that kind of influence. Garp is still employed as an instructor and his fame is being used to attract new recruits but he gets to keep his title. He along with tsuru are the only Vice admirals with special shoulder pads signifying that even though his rank is that of a VA he is respected and honored by the marines as no less than an admiral. It has been shown that akainu doesn't respect garp a lot maybe because of his family and connection to dragon. That however doesnt mean that the marines will kick him out or put a bounty on his head"

OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,-9,Mon Jul 20 22:49:26 2015 UTC,"yeah its a funny reason. But its also one of the reasons I dont like this arc as much as other people. Luffy and the strawhats really had no reason to fight doffy. They had no emotional reason to stay in dressrosa. Compare it to other arcs(alabasta, skypeia, enies lobby, sabody, the whitebeard war, and fishman island) all of them had a reason the strawhats wanted to fight the villain. Alabasta had vivi who was on the crew for like 5 arcs(reverse mountain, whiskey peak, little garden, drum kingdom, and alabasta). Skypeia had enel kidnap most of the crew and than attack and defeat all of them except nami. Enies lobby had robin. Sabody had keimi being kidnapped and sold(granted keimi is a minor character but all the strawhats knew her and they were kind of responsible for her kidnapping). Marineford and impel down had ace. Fishman island had jinbe who was introduced in impel down, as well as shirahoshi who spent most of the arc with luffy. Dressrosa has rebecca who has met luffy and fed him. Thats really it. This arc really should have had law defeating doffy. It honestly would have been better."
OnePiece,3dxysl,Black_Handkerchief,9,Mon Jul 20 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"There was plenty of reason presented. Ignoring the fact that Law and Luffy made an alliance to piss off Kaido by taking on Doffy, there's the simple fact that Doffy had Ace's fruit. That alone was more than enough reason for Luffy to be in Dressrosa.  Finally, the fact that Luffy chose to fight is completely like him. The Pirate King does what he wants because he is free. He doesn't need to have a good reason. If he wants to fight, then he gets to fight. The fact there were some other nice parallels to previous arcs (Vivi, Crybaby & Rebecca were all princesses in need of protecting) as well as Sanji having his first successful date with a woman (Viola) are even more reasons they as a group got pulled in. Luffy has always had his crew be a part of the decision-making process, and here we saw that both Franky and Sanji had very good reasons to want to fight.  Finally, Luffy defeating Doffy was totally fine. Not only is there the shared Bellamy history between them, but there's also the fact that Luffy's training is very likely to have been more intense than Law's. Law spent more time scheming his survival in the New World, whereas Luffy fought and trained on a daily basis.  It honestly makes sense Luffy was the stronger combatant of the two in terms of being able to defeat Doffy in the end."
OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,-7,Mon Jul 20 17:06:22 2015 UTC,All of the reasons you just stated were resolved before the birdcage went up. Sabo had the fruit and they already took away doffys ability to make the smile.    Sanji having his first successful date with a woman (Viola)   which is known by exactly 0 of the strawhats in dressrosa.   Its kind of obvious how weak the reasoning for luffy to fight is when he starts flashing back to them during the fight. Rebecca sitting with gladiators. Bellamy on the ground. That is it.   If the character's arent invested why should we be.   It would have been a lot better to have law finish him off. Law flashes to all the shit that has happened in his life and gets satisfaction. And lets be honest here law should have finished him off. This arc was not luffy's story and having him defeat the final villain feels wrong.
OnePiece,3dxysl,Ko-san,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:34 2015 UTC,If the story went the way you apparently want it to then it would have ended ten years ago and would have been a really mundane story.
OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,-6,Mon Jul 20 17:31:09 2015 UTC,what no it would have ended on chapter 781. And it honestly would have been better.   I dont know how you think dressrosa has been going on for 10 years.
OnePiece,3dxysl,Black_Handkerchief,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"All of the reasons you just stated were resolved before the birdcage went up.   OP did not mention the birdcage. You didn't mention the birdcage. I did not mention the birdcage. So what does the birdcage suddenly have to do with all of this?  Luffy doing what the hell he wants is a bad reason? I can't really agree: it is his very definition of what being the Pirate King is all about.  Franky was only 'done fighting after helping out the little guys, which didn't really happen until he defeated Senior Pink. Birdcage has once again nothing to do with it.  The fact Sanji & co were running away on the Sunny protecting a very important trump card that should never fall into Doffy's hands is a pretty big motivator to fight, too. Giving Doffy the time of day by leaving him be so that he could join the chase for Caesar would have hurt Luffy's crew.  This situation isn't simple, but I am pretty damn sure they had reasons to fight. IMHO their reasons to fight were far better than the Fishman Island situation."
OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,-5,Mon Jul 20 17:39:34 2015 UTC,"They could have left at any point before and during the birdcage. There was no reason to stay other than he wanted to.

Its so weak for him to not have a reason to fight, other than he has to fight."
OnePiece,3dxysl,YUNoLikeSalad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:06 2015 UTC,His reasoning to fight was his alliance and friendship with Law. Luffy has always protected and helped the people he considers his friends. What other reason does he need?

OnePiece,3dxysl,Onepiece1992,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Luffy only needs one reason to kick doffy ass and that reason is not likeing him. Luffy was there for different reasons (taking out smile factory, getting aces fruit) but after he found out about all the bad things about doffy, he decided to kick his ass. Its just like luffy to fight people who annoye him. Yea he did it also because Rebecca gave him food but if some random person just gave luffy food and the told him to kick someones ass for me, luffy wont just go do it. He still needs a good reason"
OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"Actually luffy would just do it if they gave him food. He attacked zoro because the whiskey peak people fed him. His driving force this arc was literally repaying the favor for rebecca. Its an okay motive, but for an arc with 100 chapters it is really weak. If law had just finished him it would have been a more for-filling conclusion to the fight. As law actually is emotionally motivated to defeat doffy."
OnePiece,3dxysl,RedHineyMonkey-,4,Mon Jul 20 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"His driving force wasn't just repaying the favor to Rebecca though, sure it seems that way, but that's only for comedic purposes. Since Punk Hazard Luffy was pissed off at Doffy for letting Caesar experiment on children, he got even angrier after learning Rebecca's situation, then he sees his friend Law get shot multiple times by Doffy and taken to the castle. He receives a call from Ussop group informing him of the dwarfs and the toy soldier who plan on taking down Doflamingo, but Franky feels moved by them decides he wants to help them no matter what, knowing that if he doesn't they'll get slaughtered; at the same time he gets another call from Sanji's group explaining to him how Law sacrificed himself to get Caesar and Momonuske far away from him. Sanji's group was saved by Law, if Law hadn't been there they would have probably died at the hands of Doffy. Obviously Sanji wants to fight, but since they have Caesar and Momo which Doffy wants they can't get near Dressrosa. At the castle Luffy finds out Kyrus backstory, and then when he's at the castle again with Law, he learns about Bellamy and Law's story with Doffy. You can't really say that Luffy just did this because of food, what else was he supposed to do? Leave while the whole country gets massacred? His crew got involved and wanted to help, obviously if his crew wanted to help this country then he as the captain is going to face off with Doffy."
OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"And almost all of those things were resolved by the time the birdcage went up. He could have easily just left. He also had flashbacks to rebecca throughout the fight. He didnt have flashbacks to punk hazard or the children. Which you included for some reason. And did he hear laws backstory? I thought he just knew doffy killed corazon.   Its really weak when the main characters motivations are literally defined by every one besides the main character. And the story suffered because of it. Luffys speech at the end was weak, luffys reactions at the end were weak, the strawhats reactions were weak. Just look at the reaction page, all the strawhats are just mildly smiling whereas literally every one else who should have defeated doffy are extremely emotional. Compare it to enies lobby were every fight had emotional moments. It comes of as weak."
OnePiece,3dxysl,RedHineyMonkey-,0,Mon Jul 20 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"Even more of a reason to beat Doffy if the birdcage is up, otherwise everyone dies. You're right that it's not on the same emotional level as other arcs but this is the first arc where the crew is separated. You can't really compare it to Enies lobby because Luffy had to save Robin, Ussop was technically not part of the crew at that point and they lost merry which at the end saved them. Like another user said, Luffy doesn't need a ""real"" reason to fight Doffy, if he wants to help his friends save the people of Dressrosa then he had to fight Doffy, there's no way around that. Like you said, it would have been a bit better if Law defeated Doffy, it would have felt more right since he was the one suffering, but he wasn't strong enough just like Robin wasn't strong enough to save herself from Cp 9. It would have been crazy for the strawhats to leave Dressrosa  after causing such a huge uproar and not defeating Doffy, there would be people pissed that he didn't fight him and how would he be able to become Pirate King if he runs away from battles? It doesn't make sense."
OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:14:37 2015 UTC,The thing is law was strong enough. The amount of plot armor doffy had after chapter 781 is unreal.
OnePiece,3dxysl,RedHineyMonkey-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"It wasn't plot armor though, he's just that much of a tank, and Law doesn't have that many techniques to beat Doffy properly if Doffy could avoid and reflect Law's cutting ability. Only Luffy would be able to tire him out and deal enough damge to beat him, sure radio knife, counter shock and gamma knife are powerfull attacks but they're useless if he can't land them on the target and he has the disadvantage that he gets tired fast because of the fruit. While Luffy on the other hand is really fast and can outspeed a ton of characters, and Spoiler"
OnePiece,3dxysl,rmw6190,0,Mon Jul 20 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every character in that fight has ridiculous plot armor(law and doffy especially, as both should have died a long time ago). Im not saying it is a bad thing. But law should have killed doffy."

Luffy is fighting doffy for what he did to the city, the lil people, Rebecca and her family. franky also told luffy that he wont leave until he helps the lil people.

OnePiece,3dygju,iScreme,7,Tue Jul 21 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine that Oda has made Buggy a somewhat formidable fighter post time skip. Like nothing major, but just somebody who is able to hold his own. I mean, I enjoy the Buggy humor as much of the next but there's only so much they can drag it out I think."
OnePiece,3dygju,makemunny,5,Tue Jul 21 02:36:07 2015 UTC,not to mention that if buggy is in the new world and actually gets by while being as weak as he was pre-skip... it would undermine the whole theme Oda has already set regarding the new world's ruthless nature.
OnePiece,3dygju,iScreme,18,Tue Jul 21 04:27:21 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to imagine Buggy going in front of the enemy to obscure their vision while Shanks cuts right through him, hurting the enemy but leaving Buggy unaffected haha."
OnePiece,3dygju,theskyisbrue,4,Mon Jul 20 18:53:37 2015 UTC,Except Shanks' haki is so strong he would probably really cut the poor Buggy...
OnePiece,3dygju,fabzefab,24,Mon Jul 20 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"I think Buggy's DF is immune to all slashes, including ones imbued with haki. Unlike a Logia who's immunity to physical attacks is more of a positive side effect of their powers, Buggy's whole power revolves around being immune to swords."
OnePiece,3dygju,Brook420,4,Mon Jul 20 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Why? Buggy can split himself hence the chop chop fruit name, not anti-sword anti-sword fruit. So swords not being able to cut him is just a positive side effect. Luffy, while immune to blunt damage isn't immune to Garp's punches even if it was called a Fisto' Love.  Having a fruit immune to haki wouldn't really be fair without reason, like Marco recovering if he isn't taken down in one hit because of his regeneration powers. Since haki doesn't drain powers like seastone, only bypasses them.    He could avoid a haki slash by splitting himself before it hits, which is why I'd love for him to have some half-assed CoO he doesn't understand."
OnePiece,3dygju,ONEPIECEONELOVE,10,Mon Jul 20 22:28:22 2015 UTC,Buggy's fruit automatically splits him when sliced by a blade. You can't cut him (even using haki) since his body splits before being sliced.
OnePiece,3dygju,Brook420,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Haki has nothing to do with it.  He can be cut, it's just that he's able to put himself back together afterwards."
OnePiece,3dygju,_uare,3,Tue Jul 21 08:07:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think your comparisons with Luffy's fruit is very accurate. In my opinion, it would be the same as someone trying to punch a guy with the Beri Beri no mi    . Even if you punch him with Haki, his body would would nullify it."

OnePiece,3dygju,iScreme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:29:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. We see mihawk cutting him and nothing happens. Don't tell me he isn't using haki in the war because that'll make 0 or no sense, pick one =P"
OnePiece,3dygju,Basuntas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:03 2015 UTC,Pretty sure haki is activated on will.
OnePiece,3dygju,BananaBladeOfDoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:05 2015 UTC,It sure is. But Shanks couldn't cut through Buggy not using haki and then having the same slash imbued with haki after passing through Buggy to cut strong opponents. A slash is a slash. It's either with or without haki.
OnePiece,3dygju,fabzefab,6,Mon Jul 20 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"I can only imagine Buggy crying the entire time, and Shanks throwing parts of him at the enemies at supersonic speed."

OnePiece,3dygju,ASCIt,5,Mon Jul 20 20:08:08 2015 UTC,because he is pretty much the only pirate who likes real treasure like gold and stuff. If you watched DBZ he is like hercule; the guy most people think is the strongest.

Speaking of which, The Nefertari Family was one of the twenty royal families which founded the World Government. But the king of that time didn't leave his country to live at Mariejois.

Its a ""fan-service"". And I hate that word because it means people accept that shit.   The only fucking reason she is there is so that some idiots can have their weekly dose of boners.. which brings me back to the fact that there are people who actually get turned on by a sqeeling helpless overgrown kiddo with stupidly large breasts and NO clothes. Her armor is ridiculous.  One Piece really has made a turn for the worst when it comes to female character and their bound-to-be fanservice.  Just bring me a really cool character like Vivi ffs. Nami and Robin were also really cool before the time-skip.    And what really bothers me about this whole thing is that One Piece has gone from really fun comedy on the side to just semi-hentai shit.

But, anytime a female dares to show any sexuality, not even legit fanservice, everyone pulls out their inner chivalry and makes a fuss about it.   Have the breasts on the females gotten bigger as the series has gone on? Yes. Have the muscles on the males gotten even bigger? Yes they have. Have those changes impacted the story or characters at all, outside of the art? Not one bit. Anyone who says it has is hopping on this BS bandwagon of boobs ruining One Piece.   This is a shonen series. There are always attractive females. Some of you act like there's boob jiggles, panty shots, and nip slips all over the place.

OnePiece,3dyqav,pinelotiile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:13:44 2015 UTC,The clothes and shit don't bother me and I also don't give a fuck about feminism but I think I have to disagree with you about Rebecca. Sure she isn't the most interesting character but she was very important to the story.  She was the embodiment of Dressrosa's hidden sadness. She helped show us what Dressrosa really was. I mean she is just a 16 year old girl that has been forced to learn to fight because of her situation. The whole country hates her because of what they think King Riku did. She's the reason Kryos fights so hard. When Luffy and Kryos are fighting they aren't fighting to just save Dressrosa but to save this little girls innocence.Without Rebecca Kryos' character loses all life and interest and he becomes just another soldier who loves his king a little too much.  As for her character design yeah it's a little creepy and I miss old Nami but overall it doesn't bother me. Having said that I am a dude so take that how you will.
OnePiece,3dyqav,RandomHer03,2,Tue Jul 21 09:04:15 2015 UTC,"I can't say I hate her, but I am disappointed in how she purportedly chooses not to hurt people and how Kyros reinforces this by refusing to let her fight. I understand that men do most of the brawling in One Piece, and I love how much of the story and how many of the battles have turned out, but it feels like having women be less capable of fighting and predisposed to gentleness in One Piece starts to make less sense when it's clear now that size and physical strength is often trumped by willpower (haki) and that smaller framed characters regularly send huge characters flying. That's not to say I think battling will be the solution to all their problems in the future, and I don't even want to see the Strawhat Crew's dynamic changed because I love the way it is, but for side characters in the story I don't see why we can't have more proficient female fighters who aren't afraid to get down and dirty when it comes to it. We find out that one of the things that drives Tashigi is her desire to be a capable swordsman despite what people think of her physical ability, and I thought that was really meaningful, especially since Kuina (who Tashigi reminds him of) was the inspiration for Zoro's santoryu technique. That seems like a pretty big plot point, and I feel like Oda is certainly capable of introducing characters with similar motivations if he wants to, so it would be great to see more female fighters introduced in the future who aren't limited by their physicality."
OnePiece,3dyqav,Sephirona,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"I got the feeling Oda was instilling some of his fatherly protectiveness of his daughter onto Kyros and Rebecca. It could've been a great opportunity to make a stand out female character, but Oda had different intent."
OnePiece,3dyqav,ColHunterGathers,2,Tue Jul 21 06:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right - paternal protectiveness was involved, too. I just thought it was strange to highlight the fact that she never brought anyone to harm as a remarkable and commendable thing considering the world they're in. Robin's inflicted lots of physical harm on other people who've wronged her because she had to survive, and even in humorous instances for show, and we don't fault her for that or say that she's a bad person for it. Most of the male characters also prize their ability to fight and were taught from a young age to kick butt - it's important to be able to in the world of One Piece - and it's awesome when we see Luffy and Zoro put down opponents who are unnecessarily cruel. But in Rebecca's case, she's taught not to hurt people as a child instead - is it because it's not a respectable thing to do as a nobleperson? It's not as if she needed to kill them, much like how Luffy will dish out the hurt but not take lives. Though it's weird that she did decide to try to kill Luffy at one point despite that.  Also, I can understand Rebecca wanting to honor the teachings of her departed mother, who told her not to hurt people, but why should she not hurt people to protect others, or if she has to survive? I feel like it would have been just as emotionally moving if she'd had to physically injure people to protect herself all this time only for her father to tell her she can finally do as her mother wished and not have to hurt others (or if she just doesn't like it). I do realize that Oda wanted to present Rebecca as a gentle and sensitive character who was forced to fight. She's a very strong person in the sense that she's had to go against her gentle nature all this time, but I also feel like it's weird that her lack of desire to physically injure others is presented as something so worth preserving when we also have Luffy's quest for greater strength to protect those he cares about (by fighting). A lot of One Piece's charm lies in its exaggerated characterizations - who doesn't love One Piece for it? - but in Rebecca's particular case it just seems out of place in a practical sense, and I think that's one of the reasons Rebecca's extra softness(?) is off-putting. But yeah, I can see why Oda would have to focus his attention on other aspects of the story instead of fleshing out someone who probably won't really make a big difference to the story in the long run. I don't mean to overanalyze, sorry! I love the way Oda writes his characters in general. Really would love to see Robin kick some more butt though, she seems like she'd be great at it."
OnePiece,3dyqav,Sephirona,3,Tue Jul 21 07:33:43 2015 UTC,"Well it felt like a lot of this arc was more about Kryos than Rebecca and his struggle as a father to try and preserve his daughters innocence in a world that has been utterly corrupted by Doflamingo. Rebecca was the human embodiment of the darkness that had infected Dressrosa. Thinking about it after everything that happened to Dressrosa they shouldn't be able to come out of that without any resentment, and it's amazing they came together in their situation.  As Rebeccas innocence was being being saved it showed that if Rebecca (one of the people who had it worst in the whole country) can stay pure and good through this whole ordeal then the rest of Dressrosa can too."
OnePiece,3dyqav,RandomHer03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:13:15 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. You're right, it makes sense that she instead served as a sort of symbolic beacon of nonviolence, especially taking into consideration how the people pledged to follow the King at the end even if he wanted to continue his pacifist policies. That's a very poetic way to go about conveying the message, as always I really enjoy Oda's metaphorical storytelling.  I still feel like it's strange that beating someone up is considered to be impure, especially since it feels like Luffy is somewhat the embodiment of innocence and adventure and that through all the fighting he does it's the fact that he doesn't outright kill anyone that makes him good (and pure). I guess it's best to just take things as they are in this case. I still very much enjoyed this arc as a whole, the ending was really satisfying to read."
OnePiece,3dyqav,Sephirona,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get you and it's not like she didn't fight, she used a blunt sword and used others peoples weight against them. So people probably got hurt fighting her. But overall I think it's just the way Oda can exaggerate. Taking certain aspects of peoples character to the extreme."
OnePiece,3dyqav,RandomHer03,2,Tue Jul 21 09:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm thinking it's probably just a result of the dramatization needed for the moment, too. It still feels awkward to me, but it's not as if it detracted from my enjoyment of the arc itself - just was something to think about. Appreciate the conversation!"
OnePiece,3dyqav,Sephirona,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Rebecca is a year younger than Luffy when he started his journey. I was a little pissed at first when she hid from Diamante but really, what the fuck was she supposed to do? Get brutally murdered without doing a single positive thing and also break her dad's heart as she's the only close/direct relative he has left? We saw Robin take Rebecca's place as a strong reliable female source of power, so there was really no need for Rebecca to outright stomp Diamante with some asspull, and the fact that she fought her way in Block D and at least TRIED (unlike a few people cough usopp cough) to do something is enough for me..."
OnePiece,3dyqav,triple_chamber_bong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:15:40 2015 UTC,"I refer to her approach to combat in general, not in the specific instance with a big bad such as Diamante. It's to be expected that the most threatening characters are left to the powerhouses, that's always been the case in the series. Age isn't usually a factor when it comes to strength in One Piece since there are multiple instances of younger characters being far stronger than older ones. I also don't believe she consciously decided to survive for the sake of her father either since she didn't remember him at the time - though yes, she did want to live with Thunder Soldier afterwards.   We don't really see that any male characters are excused from curbstomping people because we have one token male character already doing the work. That would just be really anticlimactic, and it's enjoyable seeing all the battles going on at once where everyone is giving their all. Similarly, the presence of one powerful female character doesn't excuse other female characters around from needing to put their all into what they're doing in general as if any one character fills some quota for female presence. I do appreciate that Rebecca tried, though, I agree. I don't even think it's just that she tried - she actually did exceptionally well to survive so long despite her choice of handicap in battle. I just thought it was strange that she was taught to not harm people when it's frequently encouraged - and even celebrated - in the rest of the series when it comes to protecting what you care about (provided no death is involved, that is). But I recognize that it's not something that stood out to everyone. That's fine, it's normal to interpret series from different angles \o/"
OnePiece,3dyqav,Sephirona,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah like someone mentioned before, it was just Oda's way of exaggerating certain traits, like Rebecca's pacifism (which runs through her family, and even though she was hated by the country, her goal was not revenge on the country but rather reinforcing Riku's ideals and doing things her and Kyros' way, which only really becomes relevant when all of Dressrosa learn it was Doffy that screwed them over and literally BEG Riku to come back into power, especially because of his peaceful ideals).   I also don't understand why every female character needs to be a powerhouse otherwise it's sexist... DBZ literally has no powerful females apart from Android 18, Naruto sort of had Tsunade and the Mizukage, but apart from that no one really... In One Piece we've had Hancock, Robin, Tsuru, Kuina, Crocodile, even Nami who is a popular damsel in distress has proven she can be useful in combat and not completely fragile. We've also had complete train wrecks like Coby (he's a bit better but he was a woeful sight most of pre-ts), Usopp for the majority of the manga, Cobra... So I don't really understand why Rebecca's ideals are so hated on when they're basically directly inherited from her grandfather and her father to an extent, and it's relevant in her quest to overthrow Doflamingo's reign, which ends up reinstating her grandfather on the throne BECAUSE he has those ideals (which now that I see it that way is a beautiful touch of symbolism). But yeah it's probably something not everyone thinks about, that's fine I guess some of us just appreciate One Piece to a different and more in depth extent than others, but that's fine! I can see where you're coming from, damn Rebecca for not killing everyone and being ruthless like most other people in this show! (If I've misinterpreted a condescending tone in the end of your post, I apologise. If not, food for thought on some different opinions :) no need to belittle others because they don't share the same opinion as you)."
OnePiece,3dyqav,triple_chamber_bong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I wasn't trying to come across as condescending, sorry it looked that way. I just stated that we were viewing things from different angles in response to what you said about how her character's actions hadn't stood out to you personally. It doesn't mean your perception of her character is wrong, it's just different from mine, which I was taking note of. No hard feelings, I wasn't passing judgement. Though, in response to your ending statements I've specifically stated that it's the ability to injure but not kill that is celebrated in the series - Luffy's battles are pretty hardcore and leave his opponents wounded but ultimately alive and able to reflect on their ideals, and this motif could have been reused. I don't feel like exaggerated strawman arguments saying that I supposedly want Rebecca to be ruthless and bloodthirsty are applicable here. But that's besides the point, I've already agreed about what the point of her character was as stated by others.   Anyway, I don't think that Crocodile has actually been revealed as female - all we know is that he knows Ivankov. It's certainly an interesting theory, though I wouldn't include him on any lists at the moment. I also don't think anyone would agree that every character of a certain gender needs to be a powerhouse, just like not every male character is a powerhouse right now, either. We have characters who start off weak, like Coby, to represent the virtues of working towards bettering oneself, which is great. You can count on your hand the number of major battles with focuses on female combatants, though. Oda's a very conscientious author, always has been, and I just feel like it would be interesting to see him put his excellent imagination to use fleshing out ideas he's already introduced with Kuina/Tashigi."
OnePiece,3dyqav,Sephirona,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:04 2015 UTC,"I apologise then as your choice of words really did seem that way :p I understand what you're saying about Luffy but he has a completely different goal, to be the pirate king, and it involves a path of many enemies out to get his head where he'll need to be violent and almost kill people in the process. Ignore my blanket statement on what you were saying about Rebecca as that was when I misinterpreted your tone haha.   And that was a joke about Crocodile as well LOL! Yeah I see your point though, it wouldn't hurt to have more important/stronger female characters, I just really don't think Rebecca was meant for that role, I wasn't head over heels for her pacifism (in fact it pissed me off most of the arc) but looking back on it and especially in the chapter where the citizens begged to have Riku and peaceful ideals back, I can see why it was important that Rebecca maintained her pacifism as she mainly had rage towards Doflamingo for usurping Riku, and therefore why she didn't hold too much ill will against the citizens/gladiators brainwashed by Doffy. And also I can definitely understand why Kyros didn't want her fighting anymore after, as the only reason he trained her was because of the world they lived in and his state, and now that he had the power to do something about it he didn't was his 16 year old daughter to have to 'dirty her hands' or whatever anymore."
OnePiece,3dyqav,triple_chamber_bong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think that that's the point, though... One of the strongest characters in the entire world is a woman, right? I think that Rebecca's character point was her relation with Kyros."
OnePiece,3dyqav,Dinh0w,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after discussing this with others I think you're right about the point of her character. I guess it mostly stood out to me because we don't actually see as many demonstrations of battle prowess from female characters in One Piece in general, so having her hold back to the extent she did sort of continues the trend. I certainly wouldn't want to replace Luffy's screentime because his battles are a blast, but when it comes to necessary plot-advancing scenes involving other characters it would be pretty cool to see what Oda could come up with involving a female character who brawled with everything she had, too, especially since he's already introduced the idea that some characters feel delegitimized as warriors because of their gender and how it's directly influenced one of the main characters of the series."

I'm not saying he's a shit character cause he is a good embodiment of 'following the system' and doing what one thinks is right, but all that chapter showed to me was that he not only believes in a shitty/oppressing form of justice but he enforces it to the point where he's willing to do more shitty/oppressing things to uphold it..."
OnePiece,3dyqav,triple_chamber_bong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. I was certainly not happy when he killed Ace, but even so at the time it was pretty obvious he was just doing his job. With his focus on maintaining the WG's image instead of addressing the needs of (and wrongs done unto) the people, his justice is no more than keeping the people in charge in power - funny in how it reflects Doflamingo's words about the winners of a war also defining what justice is. Now we see it's not so much fighting for justice as it is maintaining the status quo for him. You can't expect to reform or improve things for anyone if you don't recognize that there was a problem in the first place, and I feel like this is something that's been pretty constant when it comes to the WG's corruption in the series, so yeah, I'm on the same page as you in that I don't think it's really so much a new dimension to his character as it is just a re-emphasis of the fallacies of the system."

I don't want him to get super strong, his way of fighting is actually pretty intimidating if you put yourself in another member of another pirate crews shoes, first he has no bounty, then he shows up victorious even though no one seen it happen. He's hilarious and does some pretty sweet plot points too. If you think about Oda and Luffy, Oda couldn't make luffy have all the characteristics of his crew so he used multiple vessels aka the strawhats to pull off his multiple personalities. Oda feels strong for ussop and I'm sure he loves him equally to the crew, it shows in his art and writing. Ussop is still awesome in the manga after the time skip but I'm just having a bad love hate relationship with the animation artists these days and their acting group.

We learn through Ace's backstory that this character trait was something Roger shared (and obviously because he was the strongest ever and never lost he never died because of it and was respected). I can see how it's prideful, it definitely is but at the same time if you look at it logically, if he had ran away with Luffy Akainu could have easily killed them both, and in Ace's POV, he could've killed Luffy without Ace being able to do anything about it/react in time.  With Bluejam as well he reveals Luffy was behind him, and he was scared that if he were to run away, something bad might happen to Luffy...   I don't understand why Ace gets so much hate for this, as it was his own decision which caused his own death, and what was literally his motto with Luffy about how they'd live their life... ""No regrets"" I feel like because of Ace fanboys, people just don't relate and decide to jump on the bandwagon opposing this bandwagon, but in reality, yes, it was Ace's fault that he got himself killed even after Luffy saved him, but with everything Oda has told us it wouldn't make sense for Ace to do anything else and there's a very good explanation for it too.."

His main target was Luffy because he's basically the cause of everything going south. He couldn't get to Luffy if Ace was protecting  him with his logia powers. So he had to separate them. Trolled Ace into leaving Luffy behind allowing him to be vulnerable to his attacks. If Jinbe could get away with Luffy, then so could Ace and Luffy.

OnePiece,3dyqav,gelm1r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah he sure did that much but i said; he didnt do much for me, to make him ''likeable'' again, and those actions weren't that ''epic'' for me especially the first incident with sugar though the 2nd time him sniping was better. I dont know but i really hate those moments if you ask me(when he ''luckily/randomly'' knocked out sugar when the main plan absolutely failed.) Don't know if you watch DBZ but the 2nd half became too painful to watch for me when ''Mister'' Satan became nearly a Main Charachter in the serie."
OnePiece,3dyqav,kingofdabz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Everything he did this arc wasn't like able but loveable to a lot of people including myself. It's just differing opinions at this point but the fact of the matter is he did a lot of epic shit this arc. That's how he's always done it, he's the guy with no strength, high luck, and crafty equipment who always takes on the impossible challenge. Think back to thriller bark with him and perona, how they could have all been doomed but he's the only guy in the crew that couldn't get depressed from her ghosts, and then Using the fake ten ton hammer to scare the shit out of her. The exact same thing happened in dressrossa, but twice!! With the second time him unlocking observation haki. Not only did he initiate the whole plan to take doffy down, but he also saved law and luffys life.both times if he didn't do what he did, doffy would have won and the strawhats would have been over. I don't care what our opinions are on this matter, I'm just telling you the facts, if you wanna deny the facts just because you hate usopp, that's on you. But don't down play the huge importance he had this arc. He was epic in an objective standpoint, you call him lame this arc from a subjective standpoint."
OnePiece,3dyqav,gelm1r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"But thats exactly why i dislike Usopp i dont really mind what the outcome is for me what matter is HOW you get your outcome(the journey, the fights, the feels. HOW you win or even lose(hell i don't mind if a  charachter sometimes loses but learn from it and becomes more powerful or atleast a growth in return) . IF a charachter would win a fight while doing something dirty and wins I simply dislike that and would never cheer for it it's absolutey disgusting."
OnePiece,3dyqav,kingofdabz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"The point of usopp as a character though is to have one person on the crew who's completely normal in terms of strength, all he has is his brains and his smarts and his durability. To enjoy usopp you have to accept he may never have a super power moment like the other guys, of course he has his epic moments too, but I still count dressrossa as still near the beginning of part 2, do we really want all the crew members to bust out their best moves in only the first big arc of the new world? The fact that usopp unlocked haki alone is huge and deserves praise for that. If you think his first time knocking sugar out was shady then what about the second time? That was all his skill and his smarts and prowess alone, he was even extremely injured from the fight before and he STIlLL managed to pull that shot off to save luffy and law. If you complain about winning in shady ways then the second time surely calmed you down. That was usopp directly learning from his last confrontation with sugar. He instantly realized her weakness, thought on his feet to create the ammo, and pulled it off from the other side of the island. How is that not epic? Like what? Every complaint you have was addressed during the second confrontation with sugar   he unlocked haki -he sniped, the thing he's best known for -he sniped from the other side of the island  -he used ammo only he knew about and only he could figure out that that was sugars weakness  -did it all while extremely injured won in a fair way, not dirty like you said"
OnePiece,3dyqav,gelm1r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:28 2015 UTC,"And again thats why i dislike him :P i see normal humans on a daily basis i want to see something that surpass ''normal'' humans and the ''dirty fight'' was just in general not based on usopps fight. Thats why i like animes/mangas who do the impossible or trying to achieve the impossible thats what i enjoy to read or see, i dont want to see something what normal humans can achieve because nearly dozens others can do the same.  And just to clear this up i dont dislike Usopp for him being weak or anything, i simply dislike and absolutely hate his personality and what he did in the past leaving the crew and lying, that moment made me sick and i nearly pulled out my hair because an entire village would be victims if luffy and friends weren't there, ( sure would have happend in many other places if luffy wasn't there but Usopp could have prevented it easily by not becoming such twat and shoulnt kept lying and bothering the villagers so much...) I hate liars so much oh my god,, my top 3 most disliked anime charachters are 1. Mr Satan 2. Favaro and Usopp. and any other charachter which i forgot names of that still breath air because of lies. ( though Buggy on the other hand i find him rather funny because his intention isn't like Usopp, the guys from Impel down simply follow and believe Buggy and follow him even though Buggy didn't encourage them at all, on the other hand Usopp had to tell a bunch of lies to tonatta's about Montblanc  Noland which again makes me sick.  ( and sure the feet what he achieved was impressive for usopps standard but i rather compare to the best or what the best can achieve that's simply  my nature and i dont want to brag but i'm rather dissapointed if i dont get  the best of the best gear with certain games or the best grade for uni)"

For me, it's like yeah it's amazing to see super power stuff in this manga, and one piece is filled with that kind of stuff, people defy physics all the time and do amazing shit that would leave our jaws on the floor, but that's kinda the sweet thing I like about usopp, because on top of this huge pile of super powers that we see, with everyone blasting each other and energy blasts and explosions and DF's, we get grounded back to earth when we see usopp, the struggle of the normal guy, that's why I cheer like crazy when usopp pulls something off, because you never expect him to, you never expect him to have any super power moments, so when he actually DOES get close to a sort of super power moment, I get happy :)"

OnePiece,3dyqav,tw1260,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"Brook, he doesn't really do anything and is kind of lame. I also hate all of his humor gags. All of them"
OnePiece,3dyqav,erayachi,3,Mon Jul 20 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"To each his own, I won't judge you. But on the note of Brook, his gags have more depth to them beyond being just gags. I won't psychoanalyze him to death (yohoho), but Brook's entire comic relief persona is an ongoing facade--that's what makes him a great character. The fact he's not just there for cheap laughs--the fact that he tries to cheap laughs and makes lame jokes is the result of something deeper, more tragic than what most other characters have experienced. As for him doing nothing, well--I'm still holding out that Oda stops stalling and actually uses Brook in a more serious capacity."
OnePiece,3dyqav,Eoryr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:19 2015 UTC,That's the point of his jokes. They're always the same and he does them all the time. It's like a so-bad-it's-good situation.
OnePiece,3dyqav,erayachi,5,Mon Jul 20 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"The point of his jokes are that they make him laugh. Brook makes fun of his skeletal self constantly; I'm pretty sure it's because if he didn't laugh at it, and make jokes, becoming a skeleton and being alone for 50 years would have driven him batshit insane."
OnePiece,3dyqav,kingofdabz,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"It's this. That's why I love brook and all of his jokes. Everything he does comes from the heart, or at least..if he still had a heart! YOHOhOhOOHO!~"

Long story short, they come from being translated into English from Japanese through Chinese.  Some of the early scanlations used the Taiwanese release of Jump for their translations, rather than the Japanese original.  So, names written in Katakana were put into whatever hanzi the they use to represent foreign sounds, which is already an imperfect representation of the Japanese sounds (Just as Japanese katakana representations of foreign names are also imperfect).  Then, somebody went through the similarly imperfect process of trying to get English sounds out of those Hanzi, further removing the output from the original and giving us some bizarre names.  And that, my friends, is why nobody should ever call the Chinese translation of a Japanese comic ""raw"" when talking about scanlations."

And that she realized it is her duty to deliver all the messages to that one place. This makes me think, how far did Nico Olvia take her discoveries and of course we all know how far Roger took his. It makes you think who else has also brought them to the end. And it also makes you think how will Robin find them all? Will she have to backtrack? Or will the Strawhats meet people who during their travels are also carrying the messages without knowing how to decipher the codes. Idk, will her dream come true after Luffy becomes king and is allowed freedom? I think Luffy's freedom will reflect on all individuals and allow the discovery of the void century more possible. Maybe once he becomes king all those individuals protecting the Ponaglyphs will carry them to Luffy/his kingdom. There's a lot of variables but one thing is certain, all Ponaglyphs must come together."

OnePiece,3e0e9c,sora677,3,Tue Jul 21 02:52:29 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd speculate that if Luffy/Law/Kid fought it'd end in a draw or near draw. They are very very very close in strength imo.
OnePiece,3e0e9c,samoa2010,3,Tue Jul 21 04:34:11 2015 UTC,Honestly if Kid uses his power like Magneto then he'll have a ton of potential. One word 'Electromagnetism'.

OnePiece,3e0e9c,Bartomarimo,0,Tue Jul 21 08:25:41 2015 UTC,From what we know about him he usually attacked civilians and weaker pirates in large proportions. I would guess he's pretty strong though but his plan is definitely destined to fail in my opinion haha. Idk. We'll have to see him in action.
OnePiece,3dylus,OnePieceAce,24,Mon Jul 20 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"Until I see them face off, I'm saying Vista. He had a better showing against Mihawk, which is about the only person the two swordsmen have both fought."
OnePiece,3dylus,Magic_warlock0-,3,Mon Jul 20 17:04:34 2015 UTC,wouldnt count the fight between Zoro and Mihawk but the point stands.  But I honestly dont think they will ever get to fight each other in a serious way. For all we know Marco leads the Whitebeardcrew at the moment and I dont see why they should clash with the Strawhats
OnePiece,3dylus,WatteOrk,14,Mon Jul 20 19:37:32 2015 UTC,I think there will be a short workout arc with the whitebeard crew. Either that or they joined shanks
OnePiece,3dylus,marqt,5,Mon Jul 20 16:44:12 2015 UTC,Never thought of something like this. I would definitely love it!
OnePiece,3dylus,190x190,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:26 2015 UTC,Workout Arc would be fresh!!!!! Oh man this is one of my new favourite theories. Especially since I hoped that Marco now leads the Whitebeard pirates but could never figure out how they'd tie into the remainder of the story.
OnePiece,3dylus,makemunny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:25 2015 UTC,It sounds so corny and cliche but I would seriously love a workout/training montage arc.  Something like the time skip where we get concrete visuals of the straw hats training.  Now I never thought about them working out with WB's crew but that is just awesome.
OnePiece,3dylus,Exception1228,5,Tue Jul 21 03:22:42 2015 UTC,"Unless the theory about Vista being a member of the Blackbeard Pirates, I don't see why they would ever fight seriously. We could maybe get a sparring, but that's it.  It's hard to say who would win. Neither Mihawk or Vista seemed like they actually tried at Marineford (my observation, it may be wrong), and we don't know how strong Zoro is by now. Of course we can rightfully assume that neither Vista or Zoro is stronger than Mihawk, but anything beside that is just guessing."
OnePiece,3dylus,DirtyPoul,4,Mon Jul 20 22:52:36 2015 UTC,"Why would Vista join the guy who killed his captain, killed his crew mate, and threw ace in jail to be executed?"
OnePiece,3dylus,OptFire,0,Tue Jul 21 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"HypeHunter made a video where he predicted that Vista is actually a villain waiting to catch Jozu off guard to take his fruit.

OnePiece,3dylus,MrMuzza,3,Tue Jul 21 09:56:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say its impossible for zoro to win, but he's   notnwinning without beating a man who could hold off hawkeye for a few moments, after two years training with him, i hope zoro can atleast do that much. Id say luffy is where ace left off when he died, combat wise, and without logia, luffy was forced to find methods  that ace might not have had to. Before timeskip, ace fought jinbei to a draw. Luffy could beat jinbei imo while using g4. I think zoro has something up his sleave that he hasn't had to use against anyone sincemhe trained with  mihawk."
OnePiece,3dylus,Indicaman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think zoro will ever fight Mihawk. There are different ways for surpassing someone, especially one's teacher.  Zoro will probably defeat whoever defeats Mihawk."
OnePiece,3dylus,quilmes86,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:09:48 2015 UTC,"Seeing how we havent seen zoro even get worked up post time skip it is really hard to tell. The whitebeard crew honestly was kind of weak. Whitebeard himself was the strongest in the world. But they didnt have 1 other crew member that could fight on par with the admirals. Marco and jozu fought them for a little while, but than were both utterly destroyed. Without getting one blow on either admirals.   Honestly I expect a solid arc with the former whitebeard pirates(probably being shank's allies). I dont know if the strawhats will meet them. I could imagine the kidd alliance or blackbeard fucking them up though. When the timeskip happened I thought the whitebeard pirates were going to split up and return to their homes and we would see most of them in the new world. But since fishmen island didnt have namur that is obviously not the case."
OnePiece,3dylus,rmw6190,13,Mon Jul 20 16:58:19 2015 UTC,woah your extremely under rating the white beard pirates. The Geriosi said Marco was apart of a few people that could defeat bb
OnePiece,3dylus,rmw6190,-5,Mon Jul 20 17:03:23 2015 UTC,I really am not. People overestimate yonkos. Fact is the whitebeard pirates and their allies were just extremely large. they didnt severely injure or defeat one shichibukai or high ranking marine at marineford. That is pretty sad if you ask me.
OnePiece,3dylus,rmw6190,5,Mon Jul 20 17:05:39 2015 UTC,because of the plot. it was suppose to inhance luffy character development. and besides there was no long fight it was short two minutes fights
OnePiece,3dylus,fabzefab,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:08:25 2015 UTC,That's really not an excuse to say they are strong. They could have defeated any number of vice admirals. Hell franky could take on a vice admiral and 4 donquixote pirates post time skip. Yet the super powerful whitebeard pirates and their allies only hurt 1 named marine severely and it was coby. That is really pathetic.
OnePiece,3dylus,babydangy,5,Mon Jul 20 17:17:02 2015 UTC,Marco was only hurt because he got seastone handcuff on one wrist. He was perfectly fine until then. And after that too.
OnePiece,3dylus,rmw6190,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:28 2015 UTC,"You can't argue with this guy, he also thinks Rebecca is the next nakama. Marco, as were the rest of the WB pirates, were more worried about freeing Ace instead of fighting. Also Marco was more worried about WB, Kizaru never hurt him until he turned his back to check on WB and when he had the seastone cuffs on. It's asinine to think that they are that strong, especially Marco since he was 2nd commander and ahead of Ace who everybody believes to be very strong."
OnePiece,3dylus,fabzefab,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:18:41 2015 UTC,he didnt exactly do any damage what so ever.
OnePiece,3dylus,rmw6190,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"I never said he did. But he didn't take any either.   As a matter of fact he probably has the strongest defensive DF out there. He can regenerate and thus cannot die.   Unless his DF abilities are suppressed: seastone, and probably Blackbeard's DF."
OnePiece,3dylus,fabzefab,0,Mon Jul 20 20:13:59 2015 UTC,he also was knocked back by garp and akainu. And he was injured by kizaru badly. I think vista is more defensive. Especially if it is a logia. Really had marco and vista switched opponents they probably would have won their fights. But they were kinda stupid and attacked opponents that outmatched them
OnePiece,3dylus,its_0nly_smellz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:37 2015 UTC,I didn't say he didn't get punched or kicked or injured. But because he's a phoenix he will always heal his wounds/regenerate and could possibly get reborn if he dies.   Plus even Kizaru or Akainu would get wrecked if they were attached to a seastone handcuff. Because their powers would get cancelled.  And what's Vista's DF? He doesn't have one from all we know.
OnePiece,3dylus,rmw6190,3,Mon Jul 20 21:58:25 2015 UTC,lmao. I guess you forgot that Kizaru had to call in backup from Onigumo to stop marco.
OnePiece,3dylus,its_0nly_smellz,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:16:27 2015 UTC,he didnt really have to call in backup. The backup was there. Its not like he called him in. It was a war. And even without backup marco was losing that fight. He also got crushed by akainu twice. A weakened Akainu actually was fucking up the entire whitebeard division commanders. Jinbe did better against akainu than almost all the whitebeard pirates(marco did just as well as jinbe)
OnePiece,3dylus,rmw6190,5,Mon Jul 20 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"no, he LITERALLY called Onigumo to come in with the seastone lol"

OnePiece,3dz94l,kingofdabz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"Is the manga so far ahead of the series though, i can't imagine it being more than a couple of episodes, and i won't be visiting this sub very often, most likely when a new episode comes out, í'll come for the discussion thread, and i can't imagine that people would put spoilers in titles."
OnePiece,3dz94l,auggs,4,Mon Jul 20 21:04:48 2015 UTC,"Just don't be on this sub on Wednesday nights/Thursday mornings because spoilers in titles sometimes do slip out accidentally before mods catch them, but the manga is considerably further than the anime right now, there are HUGE things that happen near the end of this arc that may even be bigger than ace's death(maybe I'm exagerating a bit but you'll see(. The anime is on laws flashbacks which will take a few episode to complete, but the manga is already finished with all of dressrossa, that's wayyyyy more than just a couple of episodes. If you really don't wanna be spoiled, reading the conclusion of dressrossa would be perfect, other than that just avoid this sub on Wednesday nights and Thursday mornings lol"

But since before the 2 year time skip I loved every episode even when nothing happaned, they're just so fun to watch xD I guess I'm just a hardcore fan. And I do wish the Sogaking gag would have stuck through the whole series, I don't want Yassop finding out about his son so soon lol but Oda will still make their reunion super sweet I'm sure. But sogaking was more intimadating and could hold a higher bounty. I am still interested to see how God Ussop will pan out"

Considering that Caribou overheard that princess Shirahoshi is Poseiden, and was captured by X-Drake in his cover story. Could the prophecy about Luffy being responsible for the destruction of fishman island still come true. Even though not directly, Luffy allowed Caribou to go, captured Caesar Clown, and claimed fishman island as his territory from Big Mom thus getting rid of the deterrent and giving Kaido a means of revenge and gaining strength. After all what better power to have for Kaido of the Beasts than control of Sea Kings."

OnePiece,3dzffd,trackeroc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"The page where Dragon saves Sabo is very mysterious and could be hinting at Dragon's power. It has been talked about alot online, and you guys might have as well but still, here are some weird stuff about it:   We know from the flashback that there were no boats around Sabo's ship, otherwise it would have also been shot at by the Celelstial Dragon. Yet, Dragon is there instantaneously to save Sabo before he is completely submerged in water.  If there is no boat, how is he just floating above the water like that in the middle panel? And how could he have gotten there so fast and so unnoticed?  Also in the middle panel, it doesn't seem like he's wet at all, thus meaning he did not swim. Another sign that he is avoiding the water is that he grabbed Sabo just before he was completely submerged as opposed having to reach in the water.  When we see Dragon carrying Sabo on his ship in this same page, there is some sort of substance emmiting from Dragon. It might be smoke, or it could be air, thus relating to his powers. It might be air because it looks different from the smoke on the ground, which is clearly smoke and clearly different.    If some of these points have already been discussed feel free to skip them, thanks."

About a year ago you said you got in trouble for posting  piece together segments on /r/OnePiece too often. What do you guys think about starting a subreddit just for the podcast so that we redditors will have a place to post piece together threads and discuss.the episodes and articles? If you don't want to manage a subreddit would you be opposed to a fan run subreddit?

Hes got a expert weather and navigator nami 3. Got a great sniper ussop 4. Amazing chef and fighter sanji 5. the best doctor chopper 6. a genius and phoneglyph expert robin 7. a cyborg that is the best shipwright and was in vegapunks lab fot 2 years inventing shit he didnt finish Franky 8. A musician and fencer brook . Eventually 9. Fishman and former warlord jimbe. Even if he sticks to 10 what else does he need? I figure a helmsman to truly steer the ship while nami navigates the new world would be one. But was also thinking theyll need a chronicler to record their trip. And im sure thell get an apprentice and pet along the way.

I can only assume it was 0  because Teach was just a regular member of one of the White Beard Pirates, not a division Commander. Even if Teach had been there longer than other pirates, when you have ""Marco the Phoenix"" and ""Fire Fist Ace"" leading the pack, you tend to overlook the small fries.  Also, I don't think he wanted to be noticed, because the only reason he was with white Beard was because he knew that was the best shot he had at finding his devil fruit."

I remember reading a theory recently that I loved that involved Raftel being inside Reverse Mountain. It went on and starting becoming pretty tinfoil, but the evidence behind what I mentioned was staggering, and it also mentioned Shanks, Rayleigh and Scopper being 'guides' for the new generation/chosen one (the D who's probably related to bringing fishman to the surface) as Shanks had the hat with the mission to give it to someone suitable (Luffy) Rayleigh was stationed at the halfway point of the grand line to look for the suitable candidate and train him (Ruffy) and Scopper is most likely at Raftel or just before it, and will help the strawhats reach there...   It also had some other pretty good evidence about Sea Kings and the calm belt and how Rayleigh freely swam through the belt to Amazon Lily, and Scopper therefore having the capability to do the same (Oh! And Crocus being at the entrance to the grand line! So all former Roger Pirates excluding Buggy being stationed at strategic points throughout the world in order to fulfill Roger's dream)."

(The add-on gives much more One Piece themed stuff, but i like the clean look of the simple jolly roger)  Tweak: Zeppelin  Add-on: One Piece Logo Zeppelin  For the Control Center you need to use a light colored image, because if you use black you wont be able to see the keys at all...

OnePiece,3e0evi,ONEPIECEONELOVE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:42 2015 UTC,He didn't change his mind. Ace LEFT even though Whitebeard told him not to go. Whitebeard was simply putting up a front for shanks.  Also remember at marineford when Ace aplogized for not listening and going after blackbeard but then Whitebeard straight up lied and said he told Ace to go ?
OnePiece,3e093g,iceman-94,11,Mon Jul 20 23:26:57 2015 UTC,"Probably Roger. Shanks was on his crew before he became his own captain, so I would imagine the sight of Shanks reminded him of that."

OnePiece,3e093g,basicbean,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a translation error. It should be ""the wound you got from that guy"" because they were talking about Blackbeard and the wound on Shanks' face was from BB."
OnePiece,3e093g,denaration,5,Tue Jul 21 00:01:54 2015 UTC,"No, the translation is correct (more or less), and they weren't talking about Blackbeard until about 5 pages later, when Shanks brought him up.  Seems pretty clear to me that Whitebeard is talking about his former rival (and Shanks' ex-captain), Gol D Roger."
OnePiece,3e093g,Mallardy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:26:56 2015 UTC,I think he's talking in a figurative sense in that Teach wounded Whitebeard by betraying him.

OnePiece,3e093g,Mallardy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:18 2015 UTC,Whitebeard says that it hurts whenever he looks at Shanks' face. The defining features of Shanks' face are the scars that run over his eye which were done by Blackbeard.
OnePiece,3e093g,Was_Mousecop,5,Tue Jul 21 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"Whitebeard says that it hurts whenever he looks at Shanks' face.   Because it reminds him of the apprentice on Roger's ship. Which makes the scars he received from Roger ache.  And you're still ignoring the part where there was no other reference to Blackbeard until Shanks brought him up later, after an intervening conversation by saying, ""Whitebeard, I've fought countless battles ... and received countless scars. But the only one that aches right now... is this one!"" and it get treated as the first mention of Blackbeard between the two. Remember, they weren't friends; why would Whitebeard offer up a random comment on his own emotional wounds out of the blue, before Shanks brought up the fact that he was there to persuade Whitebeard to call off Ace?"

OnePiece,3e14zl,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"There's theory's that the one piece,  is to destroy the red line (blow up marjois which  would also destroy fishman Island,  that's what the Noah is for to save all the fish man) to unite all the oceans to form the all blue everyone's dreams get full filled.  Brook gets to see laBoon Luffy is the most free person in the whole world,  Nami can draw her map,  Sanji found the all blue,  Franky gets to sail with the sunny around the ocean, ussop will be a brave adventurer of the sea,  Zoro will be the best swords men more the likely,  Chopper will try to keep Luffy alive with all his medical experience,  there more detailed videos on YouTube about it if you want to take the time"
OnePiece,3e14zl,LeTusz,3,Tue Jul 21 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"I do not like that theory.  First, it basically means the destruction of the Grand Line. We, the reader, and Luffy, the main protagonist, should not want the Grand Line to be destroyed. It is the home of adventure, the place where all pirates should dream of going. It's a wondrous, dangerous, brilliant place, and you think Luffy is going to destroy that because some rocks told him to? Deny future generations the journey and adventure of conquering the Grand Line?  Second, it doesn't make sense that, if it's something that can just be done and the world is changed forever, why didn't Roger do it himself? If he can read Poneglyphs and was so strong, why didn't he just do it himself rather than faff around with the pirate era? He was going to die, but he was executed, so probably had time enough to do it.  Third, it doesn't make sense from the government's perspective. That's the big secret they've been slaughtering people to protect? Why? It's the chaotic grand line where their power wavers. It's the peaceful four blues where they have the most control. They should welcome the Grand Line becoming just another boring stretch of ocean.  Finally, the mechanics. Destroying the Red Line won't make the Grand Line suddenly become passable. First, you have the special magnetism. Then you have the crazy weather, that's a side effect of the different island climates. You'd have to destroy those islands' climates, so we no longer have winter and summer and spring islands. Finally, where do all the giant seakings go? Where to they get to live in this new world?  If feels like a good idea, that's been over inflated.  Luffy destroys Mariejois, because the government pisses him off. This destroys the Red Line directly under it. There is now a empty space where all six oceans flow into. The Red Line and the Grand Line are left mostly untouched, and you can go through this new ""All Blue"" to reach any ocean, while pirates and adventurers can go through Reverse Mountain and go through the Grand Line in a traditional manner.  Since Luffy doesn't need some artificial reason to destroy the entire Red Line, the creation of the All Blue doesn't have to do anything, The Will of D., The Ancient Kingdom, The One Piece. It's just something that happens."
OnePiece,3e14zl,gerrettheferrett,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:37:47 2015 UTC,I read about this theory as well. It was very long but amazingly detailed. I thought it was very well thought out. But if someone could predict the story like that it would be very suspicious.

My friend said ""The world of One Piece is in many pieces."" and I replied ""Well then Luffy should just make it into one piece."" Both of us got goosebumps and thought it would be epic if that happened.  Then the Inherited Will theory came along and I felt vindicated.  TL;DR: My point is that you don't really have to be that good at it, you just have to enjoy word-play."

OnePiece,3duqkb,BoredomHeights,9,Sun Jul 19 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"You know what I think he did? Kuma pushed his soul out of his body before he was 100% robotized. He can push abstract things like ""fatigue"" out of people's bodies so why not souls? I think Kuma is still alive and out there somewhere... all he needs is a new body!"
OnePiece,3duqkb,RectalRagnarok,2,Mon Jul 20 02:40:24 2015 UTC,"So he could've pushed his soul to PX1 and essentially reacquire his sentience while also being a pure robotic killing machine with Kizaru lazers and the paw paw fruit? Or would the fruit remain in his original body along with the ""protect sunny"" code?"
OnePiece,3duqkb,johngriffisgod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:25:07 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for the day Kuma pushed someone's energy out of them and they just collapse in one shot.

OnePiece,3duqkb,ArosHD,6,Sun Jul 19 19:44:34 2015 UTC,But Kuma is almost 23ft tall. This guy in Dressrosa is definitely not as much of a giant.

OnePiece,3duqkb,RosalieBlack,12,Sun Jul 19 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on how long the PX-1 batteries could keep going, remember that anything Kuma sends off flying stay flying for 3 days before they crash-land somewhere?

OnePiece,3duqkb,RosalieBlack,8,Sun Jul 19 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"That's the catch, we don't. It could be powered by #X batteries AA, sun powered without enough reserve batteries to last through a night or 3, wind, friction (by which case it'd arrive at 100% energy) or, the one I always go with, just mystery energy.    Your guess is as good as mine here."

OnePiece,3duqkb,YesMcGee,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:35 2015 UTC,"That would require his personality to be copied to the PX-1 in some way and then hidden, since the PX-1 acted as a normal Pacifista, and Kuma was still Kuma. I'm very sceptical of that theory tbh."

And after some order they will go clone wars and switch to Dragon's control."

OnePiece,3e04m1,64BitsOfGamer,3,Mon Jul 20 22:52:02 2015 UTC,"I think she's a well rounded character. She has her flaws (money grabbing and the proclivity to get a bit heated) but she brings a lot to the board - she's clever, keeps everyone in check, brilliant navigator and a competent enough fighter. She, like Usopp, requires help from time to time but never have I ever thought of her as a damsel in distress. Let's look at her, back in Orange Town she was being chased but seeing how she later got Buggy to trust her, I doubt she would really have perished if Luffy hadn't shown up; she fought alongside them in Syrup, was smart enough to look past the guise Whiskey Peak had on, took down a Baroques Work agent, fought Enel, took down a CP9 agent, survived Thriller Bark, - granted she needed Sanji to save her from Absalom but she was unconscious, can't really blame her - and really hasn't needed much saving throughout the series. She may dress promiscuously but she's always been a bit skimpy, I just think that side of her has been accentuated after the time skip which I can understand if some people can be perturbed by but it doesn't bother me. She's a strong, competent character who is, more often than not, the brains behind the Straw Hats' operations."

OnePiece,3e04m1,kyubez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I dunno about 'feminist', but from a female perspective, I still like her character. Nami gets into damsel-in-distress situations a lot, yes, but Nami is also notorious for getting out of said situations. Like in Strong World. Her whole backstory proves just how capable she is of taking care of herself, combat strength be damned. In the end, Luffy ended up helping her anyway--but not because she's a chick helpless in distress, but because she's his nakama. His navigator and friend, and she was cheated/misused, and Luffy wanted revenge.  Nami's manipulative ways, quick-thinking method of survival, her weather genius--none of that went away. The way she dresses is entirely within her character. She uses her body as a means to distract and throw men off guard. She clearly isn't uncomfortable with showing off her 'assets'. Her change over the TS can be justified, to a debatable level, since she did age into her late teens, and boobs don't stop developing really, until 18-19 (on average).   It doesn't excuse the fact that she is, in fact, very eye-candy now. The only problem I have with TS Nami however, is that she's not used enough. She had a real presence as a decision maker and leadership role, as the navigator, pre-TS. Now she's always in the background (like Brook). Her character hasn't changed, but if Oda continues to just put her on screen for boob close-ups rather than actual Nami moments (like the great story spiel with her and the kids on Punk Hazard, that was some actual character development), then I'll eventually just lose faith. Won't hate Nami, but I would definitely get very mad at Oda.  Edit: Just wanted to throw in here...Robin? There is no godly, justifiable reason her breasts swelled 5x their size over 2 years. And unlike Nami's character, almost having an exposed vagina and nipples doesn't really 'fit' into her character as the bookish, somewhat morbid, emotionally mature female of the group. Don't even get me started."
OnePiece,3e04m1,erayachi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:13:58 2015 UTC,Nami is one of the smartest people in the One Piece universe. Every member of the crew has their faults and I honestly think she is the most well rounded. Nami is much more than eye candy she is literally the person that keeps them going. She practically commands the ship and while Luffy decides where they are going it is up to Nami to get them there safely. Her strength is shown during the Arlong Arc. What she lived through is incredible and I don't think how she dresses or her habits should take away from any of that.

While I agree that Garp is a satisfying character without any Devil Fruit, /u/Silvers_Emmett asked what fruit, in our opinion, would fit Garp, not whether or not he should have one.  With that in mind, I personally see Garp with a Zoan devil fruit, perhaps mythical zoan, but I prefer seeing him surpass expectations with raw  strength and determination rather than relying on an ""overpowered"" devil fruit. If he were to have Mythical Zoan, I'd see him with a Hellhound-type of creature and, assuming he ate a simple zoan, a goofy dog breed like a Bobtail would suit him wonderfully.  Hellhound Garp  Harp is a funny character, almost always lighthearted and helpful. When he needs to summon his devil fruit powers, another frightening side of him is shown: the raw intensity and determination that he usually shows isn't paired with laughter and a reassuring paternal attitude, but with calculated, destructive moves.  Bobtail Garp  Garp's fighting style, like his grandson's, can mostly be split in two parts: his left fist and right fist and, just like Luffy, his greatest weapon is how much his enemies seem to underestimate him. When the need to use his Devil Fruit comes, it's assumed that the foe is powerful and didn't make this common mistake, so they await a massive upgrade and a bobtail seems like quite a disappointment. Just like with the rest of his body, Garp's control over his Devil Fruit is perfect, and the disappointment quickly turns into fear."

OnePiece,3dwzid,raoul_d,3,Mon Jul 20 05:59:33 2015 UTC,I thought Brook said it was because it's sea salt. Not saying it would work on any other devil fruit but I don't think it had anything to do with superstition.
OnePiece,3dwzid,CatSidhe_,3,Mon Jul 20 06:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yes the reason why sea salt ""killed"" the zombies is because their shadows are controlled by Morias's DF.

So if they think naruto is better than one piece then it doesnt undermine their credibility. On the other hand they had one piece as 6th or 7th on their top ten anime list which is too low for the series. They try to appeal to the mainstream fanbase, which is evident by the fact that they didnt have HxH on the list at all"

But I stand by my main point, they don't what they're talking about when it comes to Anime.  Examples: Saying Zoro is number one because ""He is the first member to join the Straw Hats & he defeated many powerful enemies""   On their ""best long running anime"" Naruto is ranked higher than One Piece, even though it doesn't even meet their criteria of being broadcast for 10+ years. Meanwhile on their ""top ten anime"" one piece is 3rd whilst Naruto is 7th or 8th, so there's a lack of consistency.  I quite like killing time watching these vids sometimes, but every anime one i watch it doesn't sound like there's any passion for anime at all, but because it's got a huge fan base people will watch it so they do a little bit of googling and scrape together these lists"

And no, One Piece does have pretty good animation when it counts.  Sure, the artwork is pretty bad compared to other anime, but that's because it's a weekly anime. They have a tight budget and even tighter schedule for each episode, something that is not true for seasonal anime or anime that only have a single season. I wished they would make One Piece episodes more seldom. Maybe every other week or so. It would make the animation, artwork and pacing much better. But of course they won't do that, since they get income by how much volume they produce, not the quality. It's a shame, but that's just how it is. Every major anime is like that.

I don't know about reading it while watching, and I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that. Will you read a couple of chapters and then watch from there, or will you watch what you've just read?  What I meant by saying that I didn't understand it was that I didn't understand all the 3 for the price of 2, 3-1 etc."

OnePiece,3dwm3v,mangoherbs,11,Mon Jul 20 03:33:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's strange how he ended up working for Kaido. It almost seems like he chose to. He directly instigates Kaido by attacking Scotch and the next we see, he's capturing Caribou for Kaido. I guess what I mean is, why build a crew, earn a reputation as a supernova only to want to work for a yonko? I don't feel like that is his goal as a pirate.  Idk, something feels off, maybe I'm biased but I feel like X-Drake is in it for the long con, trying to find some sneaky way to take Kaido down because he does not believe his strength alone can do it. This leads me down an interesting thought path, he probably knows a lot about Kaido's dealings, his strengths and his weaknesses. After he hears of Luffy and Law's feat of taking Doffy down, hopefully he will be more inclined to give up the charade and join the strawheart alliance (I really like X-Drake haha).  He seems like a level-headed man, so him and Law could probably cook up one mean plan to increase their odds of success, especially given the information X-Drake has learned working for Kaido all of this time."
OnePiece,3dwm3v,auggs,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"Haha I see what you mean. I agree with everything you said, he could probably help law turn their chances from 30% or whatever it was to 50%.

OnePiece,3dwm3v,FluffyAlpaca,2,Mon Jul 20 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big believer in this theory, but perhaps X-Drake is just joining Kaido's crew for the same reason Bellamy had allied himself to Doffy: To ride out the inevitable storm that will shake the world. Obviously Bellamy worshipped the idea of being an executive, while Drake is probably doing this just to save his own ass.  I really think there will eventually be some sort of Kid-Apoo-Hawkins Vs. X-Strawheart alliance fight though. It seems too fitting have an alliance of 3 + 1 first mate and another alliance of 2 + 1 first mate. Know'wha'Im'sayin?!?"
OnePiece,3dwm3v,derfalicious,2,Mon Jul 20 05:31:54 2015 UTC,I think it's to protect himself. He has no allaince so he works for a Yonko.

And hahaha that's exactly what I was thinking was that it was way too convenient! X-Drake has to be important somehow, so hopefully he joins the alliance to match up with the Kid alliance. Drake or Urouge will hopefully join their alliance instead of someone like Bonney, really anyone but her because from what we know of her devil fruit she's probably one of the weaker of the supernovas as far as combat... Doubtful she would last against Apoo or Hawkins. Maybe she could make a good strawhat or something though, she seems really popular on here"
OnePiece,3dwm3v,HippieHOP,2,Mon Jul 20 05:47:17 2015 UTC,"I hope it is Drake joining Luffy and Law in the battle. The only issue I see is how they could combo attacks. Luffy and Law were able to do the 'switch out Red Hawk Rifle' to Doffy, but throwing in a T-Rex doesn't add to that dynamic (it just brings a shittonne of extra strength to the fight). I would love to have a 3 man combo attack on Kaido, even if it's not the K.O. hit.  This will never happen, but imagine a scene of Capone Bege talking to Big Mom, her getting mad at him, then suddenly WHOOSH! Luffy and Law pop out of Capones chest, expand into full size, then Luffy continues to grow into Gear 3rd... and the rest writes itself..."

Not sure, if it ends up being a 3v1 against Kaido then oda will figure out some way for X-Drake to fit in. Maybe law could switch out both of them using the room so Kaido doesnt know what to expect, dunno"

OnePiece,3dt0ju,theskyisbrue,38,Sun Jul 19 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"This is a very well written and smart post, nice. So far it seems like the reason they don't have such a high bounty as they should is because the world government doesn't seem to want anyone to know how much of a threat they really are. Even the Gorosei were all like ""that kid again"". It's really refreshing though to see people using their head instead of being like ""Luffy should have 1,000,000,000 bounty because strong"". I do agree though that their bounty should be raised quite a bit here soon. Hopefully the weaker members of the crew close the gap a bit more, especially considering Nami is still at like 16 million, lower than Arlongs was. Even Franky is about 44m and he is probably much stronger than a Pacifista. I also really want to see Kid and Bonneys past, as well as all the other Supernovas and learn a bit more about what they did to earn theirs; as its fairly certain that none of them did nearly as much as the Straw Hat crew."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,mangoherbs,18,Sun Jul 19 08:37:32 2015 UTC,"Jimbei said that about the 500mil mark. Bounties aren't power levels, they can be but they aren't always. Its safe to assume they are with characters such as the super novas though, because we otherwise have no way of measuring them. Characters like ceaser however do not get their bounties from combat ability, just from threat level or criminal acts. we know that kid had the highest supernova bounty pre timeskip because he killed people who laughed at his dream to get one piece. Captains get higher bounties than their crew, thats just obvious. Its because theyre the  leader.    The straw hats in dressrosa will most likely get bounty updates in a few chapters (luffy is obvious, defeated doflamingo. Usopp's is from word of mouth, to the uneducated masses he was the most dangerous member of the dressrosa revolution due to doffys bounty against him in the game. Fujitora has clashed with zoro and seen his strength vs pica, though its still not certain if fujitora will actually stay as a marine and relay all that information(i think he will, no point introducing him then having him leave the same arc.)"

They clearly took a bit of inspiration from them look at bellamy in jaya he went on and on about his at 55,000,000 when once he found out luffy had 100,000,000 he crapped his pants. But I also feel that they have way more plot relevance like how one of luffys goals is to become a great pirate for shanks he probably relates his bounty to this."

OnePiece,3dt0ju,lalkberg,6,Sun Jul 19 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"I believe that the reason Kid's bounty is higher than Luffy's is because while Luffy's a threat to the Government, Kidd's a threat to anyone he passes. In the entire series, how many civilians have Luffy even harmed? Not that many. Kid, however is notorious for killing and injuring innocent people, and the Government is actually smart enough to realize that a Government is worthless without it's subjects, and therefore has a higher bounty than Luffy.  That said, I do believe the other Straw Hat's bounties are far too low (Chopper's 50B aside). After Dressrosa's finally over, I can see at least Luffy, Zoro and Usopp's bounties increase (I want Franky's and Robin's to rise aswell, but they didn't do as much as Zoro and Usopp this arc), with Nami, Sanji, Chopper and Brook's increasing the next arc."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,lalkberg,2,Sun Jul 19 13:15:46 2015 UTC,"Also, iterating on Pekoms and Ace's bounties, we've already seen that Caesar Clown (who wasn't even an officer in the Donquixote Pirates) had a bounty of only 40 million (or about 12%) less than Doflamingo, his captain. And since Doflamingo is one of the most powerful character's we've seen the entire series, it wouldn't be too hard to guess that Whitebeard's bounty would be much larger than Ace's, or Big Mom's much larger than Pekoms's."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,BoredomHeights,4,Sun Jul 19 13:37:33 2015 UTC,We can't really use Warlord's bounties as evidence of their power or threat level since they're frozen at the time the respective person joins the Schichibukai.

OnePiece,3dt0ju,JtkBasketball,5,Sun Jul 19 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"I personally think that a large share of their bounty comes from how much the Strawhats shake up the balance of the world.   Mihawk has no stated bounty and doesn't appear to ruin any of the government's plans. Dragon is considered the most dangerous man in the world even though Whitebeard was the strongest. I would assume Dragon has a higher bounty but not because of strength.  Luffy's bounty only tends to increase when he messes with the World Government and they are aware of it. Except for the East Blue, he shook up some part of the WG when his bounty raised (Alabasta, Enis Lobby, War at Marineford). But not when they were not aware/unaffected like with Sky Island.   I think the govenment is more worried about maintaining their balance and secrets than they are about actual pirates ruining random islands they have no vested interest in."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,MrKoontar,5,Sun Jul 19 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"Yea i think its safe to assume that dragon has the highest bounty in the one piece universe since he is the ""most wanted man in the world"". idk how else they would determine that"

Luffy and Zoro still have pretty high bounties (and both will probably rise again soon) BUT the others like Sanji, Robin, Nami etc. need an increase soon imho"
OnePiece,3dt0ju,otoren,5,Sun Jul 19 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"Consider that the WG wants to cover up Luffy's involvement in those incidents, though. They don't want it known that some kid took out a couple of Shichibukai. Since they started by pretending Luffy wasn't a big deal they kind of got stuck, because if they increased his bounty a lot without reason people would question it, and probably start investigating what happened.  Basically, I see it all as a big CYA.  I do agree that everyone needs an increase. Chopper should be at least 100."

It's stated by Shakky that the reason Kidd's bounty is higher than Luffy's is that he hurts civilians and Luffy tends to focus his attacks against the government directly. Not that Kidd is necessarily stronger than Luffy.  It's also mentioned by Brownbeard that a pirates bounty pretty much means nothing in the New World."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,RMP321,0,Sun Jul 19 07:18:16 2015 UTC,I have stated in my post that they are much more plot related then power levels. they just work in a similar way to the story to build are understanding of a character. We know kids a dick because he has a high bounty for hurting people. We know there something more to robin because she's shade a high bounty since she was a kid mentioned by tashigi in alabasta.

OnePiece,3dt0ju,xFoeHammer,2,Sun Jul 19 13:12:12 2015 UTC,"That's because strength is the most important factor. There are exceptions of course but generally the thing that makes you most threatening to the WG is strength.  What Luffy and the other Straw Hats did in Enies Lobby was outrageous and it's unlikely that most of the other Supernovas did anything on the same scale but it didn't make the Straw Hats more dangerous to the World Government than a really powerful pirate in the New World. They were still very weak in comparison to the top fighters at Marine HQ.  Also, saying Ace could, ""hold his own,"" against Aokiji is kind of silly imo. He stopped one single ice attack and that's because he's a fire logia. If they got into a real fight and were unrestricted by the plot it's unlikely that Ace would survive very long."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,Onepiece1992,3,Sun Jul 19 11:17:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I agree 100%. If someone has a high bounty, and i mean really high, its because they're  strong. Name one pirate with a high bounty in OP who was not storng? Strenth is not the only thing that can get you a bounty just like how robin got a 79mil bounty just for knowing how to read these markings. 79mil isn't a lot tho. when compared to the huge bounty of other pirates like ace, luffy, doflamingo, drill head guy, CC, Kid, and Law, Robins bounty aint all that much. What really gets someone a huge bounty is strenth. Dragon may have the highest bounty in OP for being the leader of the R.A but there is no way the WG will take him serious if he was weak."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,DirtyPoul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, except the last. I do believe that strength is the most important factor in bounties, but I also believe that it's not physical strength as much as military might. This is the reason that Dragon has a high bounty. He has a huge military might as well as directly and openly opposing the World Government. It really doesn't matter whether or not he has physical strength, since his bounty reflects the danger he poses to the World Government (being the organisation itself as well as the population it leads around the world), which is determined by his military might and not his physical strength. Him being a brilliant strategist and leader would make him much more dangerous than if he was incredibly strong but a dimwit, since he is the leader of the Revolutionary Army.  It is possible that you agree with me and what you meant was ""he"" as in him and the organisation he leads, and not as Dragon the individual person."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,Onepiece1992,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"I do agree that all these things together is what makes dragon the most wanted, not just his strenth. Dragons strenth tho plays a major role. No one follows or fears a weak leader. So yes i do agree that dragon creating the R.A and actively trying to take down the W.G plus his military might attribute to his bounty but it was his strenth that allowed him to do all this. Strenth as in brute power and intelligence. Im also speaking in terms of high bountys. A lot of reasons might attribute to ones huge bounty but it is their individual strenth that allows it to be huge in the first place. this is based on my belife that dragon is a beast and can go 1 on 1 with an admiral. If this belife holds truth, imagine dragon not as the leader of R.A.                       With his individual strenth dragon will still have a huge bounty. Now include his creation of the R.A. And everything he has done as its leader, you can see why hes the most wanted."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,DirtyPoul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree. You don't need to be strong in combat in order to be a good leader. It really makes no sense. It does to some extend in One Piece, given the huge difference between a normal person and a strong person, but not too much. We know that Dragon is quite strong and has Haki, since he stopped Smoker in Logue Town. But in order to be the leader of the RA, he really doesn't need any physical might, but simply leadership. That's it. Sure, we have yet to see a captain who is weaker than a crew member, but this does not mean that they have to be stronger. Nothing even hints at this. This is just the normal scheme. The villain boss is always the strongest fighter in video games, anime, movies etc. It's always the same, but that's not why they are the villain in the first place. It's the military might they have built using their intelligence, leadership and strategic powers. Their strength has nothing to do with it, at all.  I believe that Dragon is strong as f... as well, but that's not why he has a high bounty."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,Onepiece1992,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. you don't have to be strong to be a good leader. Perfect example is king riku. But to convince so many people to take action with you against the W.G, the most powerful group in the world, dragon couldn't just be this guy with good leadership skills. He needed to be strong. Still I don't see how this has to do with bounties being about strenth. Your taking it deeper with the whole leader thing. I go by what I see in the OP world and every one I have seen in the OP world who have high bounties are strong. Not one weak one in sight. After that, what ever they do with there strenth is what gets them an even higher bounty. Hell if robin was a bad ass like dragon or shanks (being completely hypothetical) she will probably be the most wanted person on earth for also knowing how to read these stone tablets (don't know how to spell there name) but since she's weak, she ain't that much of a threat outside of her ability to read the tablets"
OnePiece,3dt0ju,DirtyPoul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that Dragon does need some kind of strength, but he really does not need to be strong by the standard of New World, e.g. Doflamingo. He is so far shown to have this base line strength when he stopped Smoker.  As I see it, the bounty of a pirate captain is the combined danger to the World Government. But since the World Government want to create an image of control and power, it censors things like the Shichibukai being defeated as well as the Enies Lobby and Impel Down incidents. That's why the bounties of Straw Hat Pirates are so low."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,basicbean,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"Ace having Aokiji's natural weakness is a big step in his favor. Aokiji's only one up would be if he had better haki than Ace.  I don't think strength is the most important factor. From everything we've seen, it's never been straight up power that has determined bounties so much as what the power gets used for. Luffy's is so high because he has directly and heavily damaged a lot of the government's property and areas. Everything he's done has been either against the government or against the Shichibukai, and at one time even a Noble. Of course it took a lot of strength to do all that, of course, but if he'd had the strength he has and only ever fought a couple of people, his bounty wouldn't be half as high. That's the reason Zoro was only at 120m. He's stated (at least early on, and honestly I have no reason to think it's changed too much at all since then) to be as strong as Luffy, but it's Luffy who openly uses his strength to defy and destroy the government.   Directly declaring war on them probably helped a lot too. He's all but sailed specifically to destroy them at this point. Also, his lineage is probably a huge factor, to be honest."

Don't discount physical strength. It's quite possibly the most important factor. Luffy was physically overwhelming Boa Hancock's sisters despite them being competent Haki users. And I think Aokiji is most likely better than Ace in both regards. Ace had great potential but it's potential that he was never able to reach. His time was cut short.

Everything he's done has been either against the government or against the Shichibukai, and at one time even a Noble.   Luffy got a 30,000 starting bounty just from beating up pirates. When Brannew was suggesting his bounty he used Luffy's defeat of Arlong, Krieg, and Buggy as the justification for such a high starting bounty. Of course, an act of hostility probably will affect your bounty a good bit but pirates are all already self-proclaimed outlaws. They're all the enemies of the marines and I'd bet nearly all of the significant ones have had violent run-ins with the marines.  So to me it seems like the biggest factors should still be strength. Because the stronger the person the bigger their potential threat. Kid may not have invaded Enies Lobby but he has probably proven his strength in other ways and had his own impressive incidents. If he is as strong as the guy who messed up Enies Lobby then his potential threat is just as great. Especially if he has also shown hostility toward the marines and WG.

There was some question as to who was stronger early on but after Luffy developed Gear 2 I think the difference between them has grown and Luffy is almost certainly stronger. Oda illustrated this using Doriki. Luffy's opponent had a Doriki that was nearly twice as high as the people Zoro and Sanji fought. Of course, it's just a measurement of physical power and not skill but it's a very significant difference and Lucci was also portrayed as the best all around Rokushiki user in CP9.   Directly declaring war on them probably helped a lot too. He's all but sailed specifically to destroy them at this point. Also, his lineage is probably a huge factor, to be honest.   Do the higher ups of the WG even know about that? Unless Spandam included it in his report they'd really have know way of knowing. And with all they did would it even make much of a difference? Causing the destruction of the judicial island of the world government is already an act of war."

Ace had great potential but it's potential that he was never able to reach. His time was cut short.   This is true, physical strength is always a good factor. But, that physical strength only factors in when the haki is strong enough to breach, in the case of two logias. Judging from Akainu's durability, I'm sure Aokiji must be equally so, so I'd be confident in saying that if he were to beat Ace, it would be a matter of him being able to take more damage than Ace could dish out.   Luffy got a 30,000 starting bounty just from beating up pirates.

If he is as strong as the guy who messed up Enies Lobby then his potential threat is just as great. Especially if he has also shown hostility toward the marines and WG.   This is true as well. Luffy's starting bounty was more about him being able to defeat such powerful people, but every one after was a direct attack to the government, or the Shichibukai. His first bounty was also, technically, from attacking the marines. And of course most pirates, the stronger ones without a shadow of a doubt at least, have had run ins with marines. But, that's a lot different than purposely going after key compounds of theirs. No other pirate has had the balls to take on Enies Lobby and the CP9, for example. But strength is only the second strongest factor is what I was saying, not that it was insignificant at all. Because of course, Luffy would not have been able to do anything he's done without being strong enough to do so. His bounties have always been more about who he's beaten and their standing with the government though, with the except of East Blue's villains.   It has actualy never been explicitly stated that Zoro is as strong as Luffy.

Of course, it's just a measurement of physical power and not skill but it's a very significant difference and Lucci was also portrayed as the best all around Rokushiki user in CP9.   In the early databooks, it was stated that Zoro deserved to be Vice captain because he was as strong as Luffy. And I do respect the CP9 comparison, but if you recall, Luffy couldn't even walk away from his fight with Lucci. Zoro defeated Kaku without very severe injuries at all. Now, obviously he wasn't twice as strong as Kaku, and Luffy is clearly stronger, but I wouldn't put Zoro too far behind given the results of the fights.   Do the higher ups of the WG even know about that? Unless Spandam included it in his report they'd really have know way of knowing. And with all they did would it even make much of a difference? Causing the destruction of the judicial island of the world government is already an act of war.   The destruction of the island can be implied to be an act of war, but they could also just chalk that up to wanting to get a crew mate back and being more than willing to do anything to do so. Just like how Whitebeard did, but wasn't declaring war on the marines specifically, they just wanted to get Ace and get out. Luffy straight up declared war on them all by burning their flag and declaring it. While not a huge difference, there is certainly a difference.  And, I would think that someone besides Spandam would report it as well. Even if he didn't, like you said, rampaging through the island was enough of an act of war to warrant it. But to be fair, it was the Buster Call that destroyed it, haha."
OnePiece,3dt0ju,dragonwhale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:23 2015 UTC,Luffy and Usopp prob should have a 500m+ bounty just because they harmed the Gorosei.
OnePiece,3dt0ju,DirtyPoul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:21:40 2015 UTC,"The only reason for Straw Hat Pirates' low bounties is that the World Government wants to cover up what they have done. They don't want everyone to know that the Straw Hat Pirates have been fighting the WG and especially not that they have so far been quite successful. I think the Gorosei's though process is ""if people knew that (random strong pirate crew) was fighting us, they may join them"". Since the Straw Hat Pirates don't actually tell people that they oppose the World Government, the World Government can actually cover up this fact by keeping their bounties relatively low. Otherwise they would have to sky rocket their bounties to show how they deal with people who oppose them, which is what I think they do with the Revolutionary Army given that Monkey D. Dragon is known as the most wanted man, i.e. he has the highest bounty.  Meanwhile other pirate crews harm citizens by raiding villages and towns, which makes the citizens angry. If their bounty is not raised accordingly, people would become dissatisfied with the World Government and Marines. The World Government does not really give a damn about what the pirates do, but they have to act because of the impact they have on the population. This results in a higher bounty for violence and lower bounties for danger to the World Government, if the general population don't know anything about it. If the World Government had given the Straw Hat Pirates a bounty according to the destruction of Enies Lobby, people would start to ask what exactly they have done to justify such a huge bounty. If people knew that Enies Lobby had been destroyed by the Straw Hat Pirates, they would possibly question the strength of the World Government. The common citizen probably thinks that the World Government and Marines are just as strong as the combined forces of all pirates, while the reality is far different than this. If all the Yonko joined forces, they could take down the World Government. They don't do this, because some of them frankly hate each other as much as they hate the World Government (eg. Kaido used the battle between Whitebeard and the World Government to fight Shanks). But people don't know this since the World Government upholds a façade of strong authority of the like that dictatorships in the real world do for the exact same reasons as said dictatorships.  This turned out to be a surprisingly long comment. I hope it has a common thread and makes sense."

OnePiece,3dt0ju,WatteOrk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:21:26 2015 UTC,"Its a bit about attitude  Shaky stated it when she told about the Supernovas. Kidd to be precise - he caused a lot of casualties among civilians!  No straw hat would ever attack a civilian just for the sake of it - stereotype pirates DO. Remember Bonney's reaction when Zoro took the wounded man to a doctor? Or Law's comment against XDrake when he stopped the fight between Killer and Urouge?  Pirates are a threat for everybody and wont stop for unarmed or wounded or prob young and old - thats one of the factors how their bounty gets calculated.  But that factor doesnt exist for the strawhats - Their bounty is sheer fighting-power or the simply threat they are for the marines and their reputation AND the WG. Luffy is the only known, non WG-related, person who went to all three great Marine outposts on the first half of the grand line AND he not even survived that but left all three in chaos and destruction. And hes just the top of that crew."

OnePiece,3dv9s4,PeaceMainPirate,3,Sun Jul 19 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is considered a failure because it's weak. I think it's considered a failure because it doesn't have the same level of control that normal devil fruits have.   Momo's fruit allows him to walk on created clouds, giving him a type of flight. However, he was delirious when he did this; I.e., he didn't have control of the power. This has also shown to be true with the transformations; he suddenly transforms to and from human form without any real reason to do so.   A normal zoan knows exactly what type of fruit they've eaten, and can control transformations from the beginning (example: Kaku). Momo has not shown this same propensity, which is why I think the fruit is faulty, while still usable."
OnePiece,3dv9s4,Mdgt_Pope,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"but kaku is on another level of proficiency than momo. being delirious could be either due to his lack of food or (how many say) due to kaido trying to contact momo. I'm not sure about this but i think i remember chopper being in a state where he could not control his transformations either (early one piece - rumble ball involvement) so this bit might also be explainable.   i dont think the fruit was a failure, the comment came from Cesar the guy would never in a million years admit, that the fruit was in a any way better than what he created."
OnePiece,3dv9s4,MrKoontar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"chopper had trouble channeling his extra evolutions due to the rumble ball, he could use the main three transformations (hybrid, human, reinderr) quite easily. I think your right that he will eventually be able to control it but i believe they considered it a failure just due to the fact that it wasnt what they were trying to develop, i dont think it has to do with whether the fruit itself is faulty"
OnePiece,3dv9s4,Mdgt_Pope,0,Sun Jul 19 22:47:07 2015 UTC,"Kaku had the same amount of time to accustom himself to the fruit. Fighting ability is not related to that.   Rumble balls are a drug and therefore make choppers case different from Momo's.   About the part about Kaido - I don't know what you are trying to say. Do you think that Kaido has telepathy to zoans? Because I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why you would even mention Kaido when talking about this."
OnePiece,3dv9s4,PrinceCheddar,2,Mon Jul 20 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"First, I don't think Kin'emon has the Kitsune fruit, but his entire character is based on the Kitsune, the clothing powers are just a part of that characterization.  Second, I think Momo's fruit being considered a ""failure"" is probably due to the lack of control Momo has. He transforms quite randomly, often due to surprise or other emotions, and has not been able to transform into his hybrid form.  I think it's possible that Momo will find some way to unlock his hybrid form, which is often considered the most useful/powerful, but it will still be quite unusual. Perhaps needing specific conditions or something."

OnePiece,3dtmey,xFoeHammer,4,Sun Jul 19 12:04:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to speak to your second point as I don't have to time to find a reference for the first. Assuming all of the admirals are pretty equal and all Yonko are pretty equal (the first of which is much more likely than the second considering Aokiji and Akainu's fight but I digress)  think of it like this. When Whitebeard came to the Navy headquarters what did the marines do? They brought almost literally the entire navy (including all three Admirals and all Vice Admirals) to combat just one Yonko's army. Now think of what Whitebeard brought. He brought his whole crew and alliance with him. In the battle all of Whitebeard's division leaders were much better than all of the vice-admirals but they were noticeably weaker than the admirals. Also consider how Marco was almost Admiral level along with Ace (also don't forget Whitebeard's allies who were also all considerably stronger than the vice-admirals but weaker than admirals). And then lastly think of how easily Whitebeard quite nearly killed Akainu after he already had a hole in his chest and had been stabbed by Squardo. Oh and let's not forget how he (seemingly) easily broke broke the ocean, broke the navy headquarters (twice) and then, after being punched through the chest with lava and having part of his skull blown off, only died after getting shot by ~10 or so people for like 30 seconds straight and even then he only fell to a knee and died after giving quite the monologue. The Yonko are considerably stronger than the admirals and all evidence points to that without a doubt."

Unless everyone Luffy fights from now on is going to be almost exactly the same strength. Also, the way it's shaping up it seems Luffy will be fighting a Yonko before he fights any admiral. Does that mean once he defeats the first one nobody in the Navy will ever be able to match him again? They're just not even going to matter? Somehow I doubt that. All Akainu vs Aokiji proves is that two of the original admirals were somewhat close in strength. It's not necessarily true of all of them. Especially since Oda had decided on a special role in the plot for Aokiji.   think of it like this. When Whitebeard came to the Navy headquarters what did the marines do? They brought almost literally the entire navy (including all three Admirals and all Vice Admirals) to combat just one Yonko's army. Now think of what Whitebeard brought. He brought his whole crew and alliance with him.   Yes, he brought his own 1600 man crew along with 43 other New World pirate crews. Plus he essentially had Luffy, Ivankov, and Jinbei on his side as well.  The Yonko clearly have immense military strength. Which is why Marine HQ went all out in preparation for their fight. They probably also knew the other Yonko/powerful pirates might try to interfere and take advantage of the situation as well(like Teach did and Kaido tried to do).  Either way it's irrelevant. We're talking about individual strength, not military might.   In the battle all of Whitebeard's division leaders were much better than all of the vice-admirals but they were noticeably weaker than the admirals.   Um... what? Where did you get that all the division leaders were stronger than all the vice admirals? There's no evidence of that that I'm aware of. Aside from the strongest commanders like Marco, Jozu, and Vista I don't think we have any reason to believe they're stronger than the Vice Admirals. And as you said they were all significantly weaker than the admirals.   Also consider how Marco was almost Admiral level along with Ace (also don't forget Whitebeard's allies who were also all considerably stronger than the vice-admirals but weaker than admirals).   Again, where are you getting that his allies were stronger than all the vice admirals? Some of his allies were having trouble with the Pacifistas ffs. Also, Vice Admirals vary pretty widely in strength just like I'm sure Whitebeard's commanders and allies do.  Marco was still significantly below admiral level(he didn't even seem capable of harming Akainu at all) and Ace wasn't even close. Ace got burnt the second he tried to fight Akainu and shortly after he had a lava fist through his chest.   And then lastly think of how easily Whitebeard quite nearly killed Akainu after he already had a hole in his chest and had been stabbed by Squardo. Oh and let's not forget how he (seemingly) easily broke broke the ocean, broke the navy headquarters (twice) and then, after being punched through the chest with lava and having part of his skull blown off, only died after getting shot by ~10 or so people for like 30 seconds straight and even then he only fell to a knee and died after giving quite the monologue. The Yonko are considerably stronger than the admirals and all evidence points to that without a doubt.    You cannot equate the other Yonko with Whitebeard. Because he's motherfucking Whitebeard. He is Pirate King level. Even in poor health he's not just some regular old Yonko. He was the strongest man in the world and wielded the strongest paramecia devil fruit in the world(btw, Teach did the same crazy stuff with it the second he had possession of it. That's why he wanted it).  Also, let's not forget who punched a hole through his chest and tore off part of his skull. And who competently fought Whitebeard for quite a while before killing Ace. After which Whitebeard came up behind him when he wasn't looking to get that huge hit on him. That hit, by the way, didn't even come close to killing Akainu. Akainu melted his way back up and began pursuing Luffy a short time after getting hit and falling into that crack. He then went on to one shot Ivankov and then fight all of Whitebeard's commanders at once. He was not only not almost dead at all, he was still in fighting condition and vigorously pursuing Luffy."

It's not a fucking sports league, dude. It's not like there's a committee who sets rules for how to get the title. Mihawk is not the heavyweight champion; he's the world's strongest swordsman. And yes, defeating the person recognized as the strongest swordsman in the world is the only way to prove that you are truly the strongest swordsman in the world. That's called logic.   There could be many swordsman in the world who could be stronger than mihawk but who don't care for the title and want to live in peace, and thus the world doesnt know about their strength.   Oda wouldn't give him the title if he wasn't the world's strongest swordsman. It even said world's strongest swordsman in his introduction box.  Saying, ""well, maybe there's a stronger swordsman that nobody knows about. A super hermit swordsman!"" Is not a valid argument. That's just pathetic. If there was a swordsman who may be as strong as Mihawk I would just about guarantee you that Mihawk would seek them out.   One example is shanks, he doesn't care for the title but is evenly match for mihawk.   How is Shanks an example of that? He did fight Mihawk. We don't know exactly what the outcome was but we do know that they fought. Chances are Mihawk heard of a strong upcoming pirate swordsman and went to challenge him.

OnePiece,3dtmey,xFoeHammer,0,Mon Jul 20 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this and i think that there is definitely a chance that Mihawk didn't win that duel ( or the most wins of all their fights). Even though Shanks fights with a sword, i wonder you can truly regard to him as a swordsman. It seems logical to think that if you swing a sword with two hands, your swing will be more powerful in comparison to swinging it with one hand; we can also see this in Bleach when Kenpachi mentions that he was trained in Kendo and that his swing will become way more powerful if he swings with two hands. Oda has mentioned that Shanks losing an arm did not weaken him in any way. Furthermore, ever since Shanks lost his arm, Mihawk lost interest in him, making it seem as if Mihawk doesn't regard him as a swordsman, as might the rest of all the swordsmen. This makes me think that Shanks might not be a 'pure' swordsman and because of that, doesn't compete for the title. Then again this might be overthinking and he just compensates his arm with his haki or something."

He is stronger than pre-timeskip blackbeard as well. And he is as strong as shanks 1 v 1. So I'd say its pretty obvious he is.   People confuse yonko level with whitebeard level all the time. Mihawk is below whitebeard. Honestly until we see any of the other yonko go out(and mihawk for that matter) its pretty safe to assume he is strong enough to fight them.   Ive seen people say all the yonko are stronger than all the admirals which has no basis to it. The yonkos have large crews. Look at big mom's ship attacking sanji or kaidos massive army.

OnePiece,3dtmey,rmw6190,2,Sun Jul 19 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"He was considered because they literally have nobody else that could take WB's place. He's the closest and the strongest on their crew which is why he was considered, that doesnt mean hes near yonko level though.  If ace was alive he would have taken the title, and though ace is very strong he isn't at 'yonko' level either, but in that situation you have no choice but to put somebody in command."
OnePiece,3dtmey,Retiredmagician,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:29 2015 UTC,Why would Ace have taken the title? Wasn't Marco WB's first mate/vice captain?  He also seemed to be a bit stronger than Ace during the MF arc.
OnePiece,3dtmey,thedeadoctopus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"Oh that's true he was second in command. I was just going by the fact that he was like a son to WB and first division commander.   Ace isn't the type to stay still and lead tho, so it probably would be marco"

OnePiece,3dtmey,Retiredmagician,4,Sun Jul 19 23:16:51 2015 UTC,He did that long ago when he portrayed shanks as a swordsman and mihawk as the strongest swordsman

OnePiece,3dtmey,royalroadweed,3,Sun Jul 19 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"He's already confirmed to be Yonko level. At least able to take on Shanks, and since he's the most powerful  swordsman, I'm not really superseded that he's considered Yonko level. The only reason I can think of as to why he isn't an actual Yonko is that he doesn't have a large ecrew or seem to own much land or territoris and also is currently on the WGs side."

OnePiece,3dtmey,fashas2ace,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:06 2015 UTC,Only reason he isn't a yonko with a crew of swordsmen that just do whatever they want is probably because he's just too 'lazy'/doesn't care about it.

Please don't let your favourism towards hawk eye get in the way of your baseless judgement.  Even if Oda said Mihawk's name with Shanks & white beard doesn't mean that he is as strong as them, he just categorized them together like schibukai's are in one category. You can't say that all of them are equal even if they are in the same category. Buggy is also a schibukai, can u compare him with Doffy (I am laughing my ass of just thinking of Buggy vs.Doffy)."

Of course doffy can just kick and punch him though  And to be honest man, it's likely that mihawk and shanks (not white beard, he's stronger than both of them) are equals in a pure 1v1. Mihawk would lose vs red hair pirates obviously but I think he could tie shanks in a 1v1. There's lots of evidence for this, white beard talking about their duels, when mihawk met with shanks that one time shanks said something like ""come to settle the score"" meaning they're even."

There's lots of evidence for this, white beard talking about their duels, when mihawk met with shanks that one time shanks said something like ""come to settle the score"" meaning they're even.   First of all anime takes liberty in translation of the manga. Shanks merely said ""*Have you come for a fight*"" & that was it. Check it [here](http://www.mangareader.net/one-piece/96/16)  Regarding the duels between them, it happened nearly 10 years ago when Shanks wasn't a yonko & had both arms.

As for the second part, you don't have any evidence on wether mihawk was considered the worlds greatest back then or not, nor if shanks was a yonko. If they were even when shanks had 2 arms then it stands to reason mihawk would win with 1 armed shanks (I know shanks didnt lose any power, but he surely lost sword fighting finesse, fighting 1 armed is different than 2 armed)"

Bartolomeo has obvious weaknesses as well. First is that his barrier is not sound proof. Lots of characters have sound based attacks. Second is from what he have seen if you dont use a lot of force the barrier doesnt protect him(ex. bellamy tried punching him and was blocked, but he grabbed him just fine). third he cannot create a barrier like a suit of armor. This means characters with devil fruits like say robin could easily get inside the barrier and finish him off.  Other potential weaknesses that are not confirmed yet are poison going through the barrier, the effects of a master of CoA haki on the barrier(bellamy is the only user to hit the barrier), and whether or not the barriers can protect from users coming from underground(ex. chopper)."

OnePiece,3dtk6w,rastogishubham,5,Sun Jul 19 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"The point of Haki is to increase the damage done by an attack, to act as a suit of armor and to bypass the immaterial and touch upon the material body of Devil Fruit eaters, like Logia or Luffy.   Powers like Buggy's or Bartolomeo don't hide their material body beneath an immaterial one and thus shouldn't be effected by Haki- or in Buggy's case, Haki-imbued cuts- beyond the normal ""being hit harder"" thing.   But powers like Law's Room can at least be blocked, if what Doflamingo, Smoker and Vergo implied is to be believed. But again, this is Haki utilizing its known powers and acting as a ""suit of armor.""  Haki is not the perfect counter to devil fruits."

OnePiece,3dtk6w,TiggerTheTiger1999,2,Mon Jul 20 15:10:19 2015 UTC,Haki doesn't bypass devil fruits at all. The only thing we've seen it do to let people touch/damage the users when their fruit is something that affects their body.

OnePiece,3du1t5,foXiobv,3,Sun Jul 19 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"I've wrote it here before, but we dont even know for SURE that she really alter the age of her victims. She maybe just changes their apperance.  An example: Two marines get ""hit"" by her - both are around 30 years old. She switches 25 years around between those two, and now we have two 30 year old men in the bodies of a 5 year and a 55 year old. But who says they get their lifespan changed? Theory here is every being has its lifeyears (without outer causes) fixed - so they just die in a extremly old or a bit too young body after their years are over.  Also it could be possible that her power simply has a range like Law and the effect wears off. Not enough information."
OnePiece,3du1t5,WatteOrk,3,Sun Jul 19 14:45:13 2015 UTC,I don't think the actual age number is what the OP was talking about. They probably meant power wise. Getting hit by a crippled or baby admiral won't be quite the same as getting hit by a prime admiral.
OnePiece,3du1t5,CatSidhe_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:35:06 2015 UTC,good point  I think I got carried away by all that speculation about her possible role for the WG in this subreddit.

I got a feeling new world arcs are not going to be the 5-15 chapter arcs that were in east blue.  This arc showed a lot of new stuff, had a lot of buildup for future events and also had a huge impact on the One Piece world. It had a decent lenght considering."

Just that one thing, though...."
OnePiece,3dqmu3,Droggelbecher,13,Sat Jul 18 17:13:35 2015 UTC,Well you're immune to fun. The fact that they took it so seriously made it comedy gold for me.
OnePiece,3dqmu3,Cloak007,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:21:09 2015 UTC,Yeah Sanji's nosebleeds led to one of the bigger plot points of that arc. It was very One Piece.

OnePiece,3dqmu3,FakeAdminAccount,7,Sun Jul 19 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"I actually really enjoyed the Fishman Island arc. For some reason I just feel that arcs like that embody 'One Piece' as they've got a mix of humour, action, strange new characters and strange new islands. It's kind of hard to explain; I'd say the Skypiea and Sarboady arcs are quite similar to it."
OnePiece,3dqmu3,TheCalluminati,6,Sun Jul 19 11:05:03 2015 UTC,Fishman Island was my favorite OP arc. It was simple and fun. And we got to see the Strawhats cut loose
OnePiece,3dqmu3,DLottchula,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:32:22 2015 UTC,"Well I assume it's because they don't have the best/biggest fights in them. We may love One Piece for so many other reasons before/after the fighting but we should remember it is a shounen and a lot of shounen fans are mainly looking for some kick ass fights. Which of course there is nothing wrong with, we just have to endure some bitching about arcs being too long, and how there is too much talking."

OnePiece,3dqmu3,PressluftAma,10,Sat Jul 18 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"Well not the Tontatta (even if CP0 could be more interesting), but Rebecca, man she got way more attention that she deserved, specially by the people deluding themselves about she joining."
OnePiece,3dqmu3,Doomroar,6,Sat Jul 18 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"Neither did anything throughout the entire plot. There was zero character growth for both Rebecca and the Tontatta, and they added literally nothing to the story aside from sob stories and the ""I'm so naive!"" humor style Oda loves.   If you cut them all out, the story could progress in the exact same way. They could still meet on Green Bit, Luffy's Colosseum fights wouldn't change at all, they'd still go in the same direction toward Doffy and every fight could stay basically the same. Even peoples' motivations (except Franky?) would be exactly the same!  It's actually quite crazy how little impact they had on the plot."

I liked most of Dressrosa, and there's no way it could've been a short arc (shortER, yes) with Donflamingo as the boss fight, he's like a day 1 villain that was hyped throughout the series. That said, there are certainly parts that didn't need to be dragged out, like a lot of the focus on the other characters that were just met in the Colosseum."
OnePiece,3dqmu3,CrimsonReaper,8,Sat Jul 18 21:57:25 2015 UTC,Dressrosa has seriously lasted two years but in the Manga it's all still within one day.
OnePiece,3dqmu3,localafrican,4,Sat Jul 18 18:42:45 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought. Damn that's so surreal to me, but I guess Oda's progression made me forget about when it even started. Don't know if that's a good thing or bad."
OnePiece,3dqmu3,CrimsonReaper,3,Sat Jul 18 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"Whoever fun-edited gets it.  It was a beast of an Arc with more positives than negatives IMO. - To be honest I think that Oda in the last part of the decade has been focusing on writing one piece as to be read in one piece, no pun intended, from start to finish - once it's done.  Since he want's to leave behind a strong legacy and all that. I mean one piece will be a complete work many years more than it will be an on going work."
OnePiece,3dqmu3,corgispls,2,Sat Jul 18 21:00:59 2015 UTC,"This is very true. I declared that 789 was the worst chapter ever because u just couldn't stand how it was being drug out, but upon re-reading it in conjunction with several of the previous chapters, I take it back. Oda is fleshing it out as fully as he wants without any regard to the weekly format. Most writers couldn't get away with that, but no editor is going to interfere with his process these days."

He's ""El Risitas"", and the other man doing the interview is Jesús Quintero, a quite famous journalist here in Spain. This was a late-night kind of program which aired 7-8 years ago called ""Ratones Colorados"", which can be translated to ""Red Mouses"". The subtitles are alright, so you can understand what he is saying. Risitas was more of a joke guest for the program, as was ""El Cuñao""  BTW, now I know how German people feel when watching any Hitler montage: it's so weird to read the wrong subtitles haha"

OnePiece,3dqmu3,DirtyPoul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"I know Spanish and i still have no idea what exactly they are talking about, but i will try my best:  It seems that the guy talking was a part time waiter on a family restaurant near the coast, like the kind that eats without money and now has to pay by cleaning the dishes, that kind, and the main cook tells him to go clean the paellera (a kind of frying pan) and to do it fast for the customers are coming and there's no time.  But it seems that he was slacking on the job at the moment that the request was made, so when they find him he rushes unrepresented (some trunks, sandals and that's it, typical vacationer attire but not something a waiter should be wearing on the job) they said they didn't gave him time to prepare so he had to go that way (this is the first part of the clip), anyway he can't find the paellera, and to his surprise quite a big wave had dragged it out into the sea, and now the paellera is lost (this is when they all start losing their shit laughing the first time) so it seems that the restaurant is either really, really close to the waters, or this lazy bastard was eating directly from the paellera and was near the beach or swimming when the cook goes and ask him to clean the paellera, then a big wave hits him and then he loses the paellera, i guess that's more likely what happened.  Anyway he loses the paellera and now has to go and find him, luckily he finds it stuck on some rocks nearby, what comes next is a bunch of sequences of him messing up the restaurant by being incompetent, and in the end he ends having to repay them more money, the host asks him how much money he made at the end of the day, and the guy tells him ""i had to pay them about 4 paelleras"" and then it ends."

Damn your right .Dude I spend a hell of time here.Unpopular opinions don't get down voted to oblivion.You must have gotten -3 before you made your edit which , inevitably, made you drop down.This sub has a down vote complaining more than a down vote problem(which though exists isn't bad)   I get what you're trying to say the problem isn't here.   The problem is solved.That was my whole and only point.There was no reason for the sentences and paragraphs preceding the above phrase.   redditor for 4 months.   Nope.Second account after deleting the first.  Let's just end it here since you agree with me.Don't bother replying because I know your gonna pull something pull of your ass nothing again and I am not gonna check because ofmthat.(I have low bullshit tolerance)"

Hell, DoFlamingo is probably the closest thing to an Emperor that there is in the New World.  I also like that Oda used a lot of this arc to show that just having haki isn't all that.

OnePiece,3dr4v3,JimmyBaloo,4,Sat Jul 18 20:01:19 2015 UTC,The thing about one piece is that there are so many wonderfully fleshed out and brilliant characters that any of the side characters dying would be a travesty. I mean we knew white beard for one arc yet I felt for his death. Really we didn't know Ace at all. We know Hachi better than we know Ace.  Garp dying would be a major loss.

OnePiece,3dr4v3,TarasWalterLaw,6,Sat Jul 18 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"The first one to join would have to be the tied up monster. Did you see all the videos? The theory is, for me at least, VERY convincing, although I want Bellamy to join the crew.  Smoker joining Luffy isn't too unlikely, since he, like Zuko, joined the Protagonist after a long rivalry when they realized the true colors of their government. I bet there's a trope for that, but I'm too lazy to look it up."
OnePiece,3dr4v3,TidewaterBastion,3,Sat Jul 18 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"I think I can see Smoker joining the crew, but not Tashigi.

OnePiece,3dr4v3,TidewaterBastion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:48:26 2015 UTC,dont worry he said hes gonna alter most of this theories with the new revelations. but he was one the the first people to post an in-depth comparison and inturn a recruitment formula if you will. i can see why people dont think smoker/ tagashi wouldn't join but im going to assume its from the shitty interpretations derived from the OPwiki about their chars. Too many possibilities but the odds of smoker going revolutionary are still pretty high and people still forget the fated final showdown between luffy and smoker. how unlikely is it that we will get a smoker flashback which actually explains the trauma that caused him to go from admiring roger to a cynical pirate hating fuccboi. I'd bet my life on this happening at some point.Him overcoming said past and joining luffy is up in the air and him joining the revs is pretty high. As for tagashi we have too little on her to make an objective argument. but i can personally see her have some relation with kuina and/or the poetic beauty of Zoro giving her kuinas sword. Oda can do both/either/neither with tagashi a SH or not
OnePiece,3dr4v3,xFoeHammer,0,Sat Jul 18 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"Tashigi respects Smoker, I don't think that would stop if he joined up with the SH, though that does throw a wrench into the order.   However, Robin joined the crew after Franky but before Brook, while Nami joined the crew after Usopp and after Sanji."

OnePiece,3dsjj7,MrMuzza,-2,Sun Jul 19 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, Oda probably put that to show the impact of Conquerers Haki and won't do anything with it.  Remember, Armament Haki? It used to be invisible before Oda decided to make the skin/clothes/weapons black."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,ShadoHazard,14,Sun Jul 19 02:55:17 2015 UTC,"There have been other instances of Haki having a physical presence, like in the between Luffy and Chinjao where the clashing of their conquerors haki blew other fighters out of the ring. Also the decision to make armament visible makes the most sense, considering it has become a regular occurrence and not the inexplicable rarity it was before."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,SirL33t,10,Sun Jul 19 07:35:19 2015 UTC,"It still is invisible, how hard is it for people to remember that? Hardening is a technique, a more stamina burning stronger version of the average armament."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,LordHarza,4,Sun Jul 19 09:21:39 2015 UTC,Can you provide a source for that?
OnePiece,3dsjj7,190x190,3,Sun Jul 19 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"A source? You mean like Pekoms punching the living shit out of Caribou, or Zoro cutting Monet's cheek? I will come back with a manga link soon if needed.  On the latter part, Luffy in the latest chapter fights seems to give insight to it using up stamina, but the first part proves that it is an armament technique."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,LordHarza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:22 2015 UTC,"Your comment made it sound like there are two distinct versions of CoA haki. I think that is not exactly right. In my opinion, the black color was introduced to indicate particularly high concentration of CoA haki, while lower concentrations are less visible. High concentrations are important to use it as armor, for example.   Also, when Pekom punches Caribou, we don't really see the important part of his fist. Same goes for Zoro's sword when he cuts Monet, who had to be tangible anyways in order to bite Tashigi.  I agree that CoA haki depletes stamina, but I think it's depending gradually on the amount you use and not a two-state system."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,190x190,0,Sun Jul 19 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"It would seem to me though that Armament: Hardening is a technique, though I do agree that is not just a two part system, that stamina depletion depends on the amount of haki used. And yes, I do also think that hardening is concentrated haki."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,LordHarza,5,Sun Jul 19 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Oda said if Luffy could master Conquerors Haki, he too can affect his surroundings like Shanks did."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,Doodle210,6,Sun Jul 19 06:45:35 2015 UTC,Source please. I think I would've heard that before if he really said it. Everyone should be skeptical of this sort of claim unless a good source is provided.
OnePiece,3dsjj7,xFoeHammer,18,Sun Jul 19 11:37:07 2015 UTC,Conqueror Haki basically denotes a natural leader or a person of high influence. A pirate with Conqueror Haki will become a huge threat to the government over time.
OnePiece,3dsjj7,RectalRagnarok,0,Sun Jul 19 05:05:01 2015 UTC,"But... Why? That's what this post is about. What does Conqueror haki do to make them a ""threat"""
OnePiece,3dsjj7,moltenw,5,Sun Jul 19 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"If you look at characters with Conqueror Haki, they are always ones that pull the most influence. They are: Yonkus, Schichibukai, Admirals, you name it. If a pirate develops this Haki, that means they will in due time become a highly influential individual that will become a threat to the government.  The WG and Marines by extension value peace and stability. Pirates with CH are destabilizing elements. They can lead large armies and take down minor as well as major governments (depending on their influence). If the WG sees a minor pirate ""unlock"" the power they would want to take him out in order to prevent a giant pain in the ass in the future. It would be like killing off Shanks or Whitebeard before they establish themselves as a giant wrecking ball of death."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,RectalRagnarok,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"While that's true in One Piece, in reality, someone like Luffy or even like Shanks could have easily died if for example someone stronger came for them and killed them (when they were weaker), so the conqueror haki doesn't matter if the individual has it or not."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,moltenw,7,Sun Jul 19 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"you are right, everyone was a baby at some point"
OnePiece,3dsjj7,jax_the_champ,25,Sun Jul 19 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"One other trait is to Spoiler  It's not the Conqueror's Haki itself, it's just a sign that the person is fit to be leader/king/queen. It is shocking especially when Luffy a rookie is able to do it, which means he may be more than just another pirate.  Also the radius Luffy clears is pretty huge. Maybe in the future, with more strength you can knock out more people."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,Holanz,10,Sun Jul 19 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"To add to what other people have said, Conqueror's haki is a one in a million kind of thing. It's indicative of a conqueror, a king of some sort. It signifies greatness. It's like a manifestation of your willpower in a way.  We have really only seen it used to knock out fodder, but there's still much to be explored about it."
OnePiece,3dsjj7,jet_10,8,Sun Jul 19 07:14:56 2015 UTC,"I remember when Luffy used it in Marineford, and Ivankov thought to himself- ""No wonder he has so many allies."" Haoshoku Haki is the mark of a true leader. People will unconsciously be drawn to that person. I think the government is terrified of Haoshoku users since they can gather a huge number of followers, giving them strength to oppose the World Government."

OnePiece,3dsjj7,Bobbcat2,0,Mon Jul 20 16:46:11 2015 UTC,If I remember which Haki that is. Its because it can be used to Command people. When luffy was on amazon lily he got them to stop smashing his friends. To the weak they just pass out. To the medium its a command. To the strong I think it still shakes them a bit.

That's the point though. They represent the embodiment of a warriors fight and nothing more. It's doubtful Oda would write them into the story again, though i'm not against the Strawhat's getting help from Elbaf. They have befriended more giants then just Brogy and Dorry."

Zoro: After that the straw hats only hear stories* of a three sword wielding warrior who saves towns from entire fleets of pirates every now* and again.   Nah. he'd keep showing up back at the Sunny since he got lost. Nami would be amazed he isn't dead from wandering the grandline.

OnePiece,3duob6,PratishYadav,7,Sun Jul 19 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Haki, aside from making your attack stronger simply breaks down any natural defense a DF might give, it doesn't negate the DF.  For example Luffy can hit Crocodile in the face with Haki but Crocodile doesn't stop being sand, he can still use his powers while a Haki coated fist is in contact with him.  A person can punch Luffy with a Haki coated fist and it will simply negate the rubber protection he usually gets but can still stretch the rest of his body and punch back."
OnePiece,3duob6,Freyzi,3,Sun Jul 19 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"Someone with complete haki mastery fighting a person with mastery over a DF would have the upper hand   I take it you missed Law vs Vergo? Law vs Smoker for that matter which was pure devil fruit vs pretty good haki + pretty good mastery + seastone weapon.  Even Whitebeard was renowned for having the strongest Paramecia (not sure if that's a fact or in-universe hype from fodder) and even though I'm sure his haki was top tier, we only saw him wreck shit with his df... Blackbeard as well... I think haki just made a suitable powerup for everyone, especially Luffy, as pre-ts they were a LONG way away from entering the New World and surviving.   I do wish it was introduced earlier but thats another topic   I do agree with this though, because of things like the Ace vs Smoker fight. If we assume Smoker didn't know/use haki back then and Ace did to a certain extent (even if he relied more heavily on his df) he should still have had the upper hand (with Smoker not being able to hit him at all if he doesn't use haki and Ace who should be able to hit him) with Blackbeard and Akainu I don't care as much because the end result would still be the same, possibly different with Blackbeard since he doesn't seem to use it."
OnePiece,3duob6,triple_chamber_bong,0,Sun Jul 19 17:42:03 2015 UTC,Law is a very special case. His df is the ultimate weapon against someone with haki

Luffy is able to make his punches faster/stronger using his DF, and he also has haki to add the extra power. Plus Luffy was able to get strong because of his DF. It helped him survive east blue and the grand line so that he could get to the New World while learning haki along the way."

I think though one piece is not more of a physical things in a particular place. Its an idea. A recognition from every pirate in the grand line. Else the yonkou would have already found it. Whitebeard knew what it was.. He would have just shown it to ace and made him the pirate king.  One piece is something you earn from your travels in the grand line. And I think luffy kinda gets this. Its why he never let Raleigh give him any hints.  For us, the readers, one piece is the story. Not the mythical treasure that would mean the end of the series. But the very series itself. The epic stories of a kid who came from nothing and shook continents and governments.  That is one piece."

OnePiece,3dqz05,rmw6190,7,Sun Jul 19 04:11:37 2015 UTC,"hmm, interesting, i like how you say we have all seen this theory when i havent :)"
OnePiece,3dqz05,PeloyGeek,4,Sat Jul 18 21:03:16 2015 UTC,I'd like to point out that I also haven't.
OnePiece,3dqz05,ASCIt,5,Sun Jul 19 05:42:19 2015 UTC,"Well there's enough links here, i was not combiced by the tattoos, but now that you bring up Bartolomeu Dias, and Gambia, which all point towards Barto, then maybe they do share a link.  As for Barto joining the crew maybe on a distant future, but not on this arc, hell fucking trash piece of shit Bellamy somehow got more points with Luffy than anyone else, however i think that Luffy like Bellamy way more than any fan out there wants Luffy to like Bellamy, after all Bellamy is like a lamer version of Gin."
OnePiece,3dqz05,Doomroar,4,Sat Jul 18 21:37:58 2015 UTC,I wanted Gin to join with Luffy so bad.  Gin was like the first character I felt really strong besides the Fishmen.
OnePiece,3dqz05,jonstark4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:49:34 2015 UTC,Yeah and instead we get Bellamy.
OnePiece,3dqz05,Doomroar,7,Sun Jul 19 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"Very good catch. I'd be surprised if he ISNT his son at this point with all these hints pointing towards it, and Oda never forgets about these tiny details."
OnePiece,3dqz05,Retiredmagician,3,Sat Jul 18 19:25:52 2015 UTC,The tattoos look way different...   It's like if I was saying Shakky is Barto's mom because his tattoo has little bat wings like her jacket's collar.
OnePiece,3dqz05,fabzefab,3,Sat Jul 18 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"Man I wish I knew how does Oda gives such cool name to his characters. Even Boa Hancock makes sense in every way, Boa it's from the snake part, but it also means ""hot"" in Portuguese. Oda is jus to GODA"
OnePiece,3dqz05,BartolomeoAllen,2,Sun Jul 19 15:05:41 2015 UTC,Soo Bartolomeo D Ias confirmed or?
OnePiece,3dqz05,SWATtonitos,2,Sun Jul 19 20:26:17 2015 UTC,Kind of a stretch. On pretty much all of it. I doubt bartolomeo will get a sad backstory. Since we really dont need one for him and cavendish.   I also doubt luffy even remembers devil dias.   If we went by solely what people look like than almost every female is related.
OnePiece,3dqz05,rmw6190,4,Sat Jul 18 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"did you even click the second link? you wouldn't say that if you did. Okay what i am saying is that there was already a theory that bart and dias look the same therefore they are related. My post is saying that bartolomeo could be based upon an explorer named Bartolomeu Dias. This find would be more evidence for that theory, do you understand now?"
OnePiece,3dqz05,rmw6190,2,Sat Jul 18 19:11:48 2015 UTC,I did thanks. It is still very much a stretch. Its like saying he is related to kuma because they have similar names. I think its pretty obvious you want him to have more backstory so he will have a reason to join the strawhats.
OnePiece,3dqz05,rmw6190,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"yeah i know its obvious that i want him to join the strawhats, i just slipped that in there. Thats not the point though, its just possible bartolomeo character development."
OnePiece,3dqz05,rmw6190,-3,Sat Jul 18 19:31:25 2015 UTC,you did it again. first you said we cant assume they are related just because they look alike. Now you are saying we cant assume they are related because they have similar(identical in sound) names. Thats 2 different things they have in common. And his full name is Bartolomeu DIAS! having a similar first name is one thing but having also a similar last name isn't just a coincidence.
OnePiece,3dqz05,aywaitaminute,2,Sat Jul 18 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"and we cant. No matter how much weak evidence you have, doesnt make your theory any good."
OnePiece,3dqz05,NippleLights,-2,Sat Jul 18 19:59:47 2015 UTC,You are sooo confused bro. What theory? i never made a theory. this was already an existing theory that i found a small piece of evidence for. just stop its sad.
OnePiece,3dqz05,aywaitaminute,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:15:09 2015 UTC,So you didnt post a theory on this subreddit that I responded to by saying the evidence was weak?
OnePiece,3dqz05,NippleLights,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't Devil Dias's last name be Devil, not Dias? Since we're using the Japanese name scheme."
OnePiece,3dqz05,aywaitaminute,5,Sat Jul 18 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"i guess you are right. There has been the odd case though for example Rock Lee, his son's name is Metal Lee. thats the only odd one i could think of, so i guess i am wrong."
OnePiece,3dqz05,DemonOfTheMist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:59:15 2015 UTC,Some character names in One Piece use the English name scheme.
OnePiece,3dqz05,aywaitaminute,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:53 2015 UTC,Really? Like who?
OnePiece,3dqz05,DemonOfTheMist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:17:29 2015 UTC,Edward Newgate and Marshall D. Teach are the first that come to mind.
OnePiece,3dqz05,AlvisDBridges,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Hody Jones is another one I just remembered, too."
OnePiece,3drmf1,FanEu7,15,Sat Jul 18 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't like him to act like a real hero actually, at least in the way we usually see heroes.  I just think that he will do what he thinks is right in order to protect what & who he loves. Seeing some of his friends being eventually involved with what will happen to the world, he will act in such a way to help them. If destroying the WG does help or save them, then he'll go for it if he has the power, with help or not.   I think his relationship with the Revolutionnaries will be Whitebeard-like during Marineford. He won't care, but as long as they aren't in his way, then he'll let them be. It would be like a parallel situation. The Revolutionnaries will have an impact on the society and the administrative parts (maybe more stuff, I'm not totally sure as how the WG works), whereas Luffy will change the world with his power and will. They complete each other, they do not need to be proper allies (unless Luffy needs more help or Sabo is in danger for instance).  Luffy sure needs development. But for him to clearly care about all of this, in my mind, isn't completely necessary. Acts are stronger than intentions, Luffy is a good example of that."
OnePiece,3drmf1,MyonnieBoobie,0,Sat Jul 18 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"True that way he would still be Luffy, him becoming a more classic hero would certainly be strange and out of character  In what way does he need development apart from this?"
OnePiece,3drmf1,MyonnieBoobie,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"I don't really know, Luffy is still a mystery to me (I am so used to dark heroes being tragic and dramatic all the time !!). As for development, he doesn't really need to change that much.   What I would love though for him is to ""grow up"". Yes, he is like an innocent and careless little monkey in this cruel world, but I'd like him to take things more seriously sometimes. As Zoro perfectly said, this is just the beginning of the New World.  EDIT : I'm waiting for Oda to make him grow the way he feels is right. I expect a development, but I just can't see how  for now. (I still love Luffy of course !)"
OnePiece,3drmf1,Curryriceandpeas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like Ace dying could have developed him a bit more, that was the perfect opportunity"
OnePiece,3drmf1,SwordMaster21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"Instead of him supporting the revolutionaries, something significant can happen like Ace's execution, and he gets support from Revolutionary Armies.  Of course he should show that Luffy and his mates shouldn't rely on them too heavily, just to keep that ""3D2Y"" wasn't for nothing.  EDIT: btw I am almost halfway through 500 so whatever happens in the other arcs are comepletely out of my knowledge."
OnePiece,3drmf1,TarasWalterLaw,9,Sun Jul 19 05:11:23 2015 UTC,Robin wants to know the true history so Luffy wants to find it. Sabo wants to fight the World government so Luffy wants to fight it. Luffy wants to protect and encourage his friends so he will do what he has to.
OnePiece,3drmf1,TarasWalterLaw,5,Sat Jul 18 21:35:12 2015 UTC,Simple answer is no since oda designed it that way. We will perceive the story of the void century as readers most likely through Robins view. The revolutionaries fight for an insurrection of the current WG. The good vs evil WG is big theme in OP. So we could prolly see it 2 ways  1) Revs view+ SH view( hard to predict events leading up to it) mb the Reviere coming up 2) New SH whos goal it is to reform the goverment and portray it has a true face of justice. This new SH would give Oda options to expand and portray some of the intricacies of its structure. 3)combination of the 2
OnePiece,3drmf1,cheedle,0,Sat Jul 18 21:08:59 2015 UTC,Do you think thats a good thing (that Luffy doesn't care about all this stuff)?  It will probably be a big part of the last arc(s)
OnePiece,3drmf1,Mdgt_Pope,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"I think Luffys at a good place and I think its a good thing as well. Since his char views the world in the dichotomy of black/white it always other char to actually get screen time. good example is Dessrossa. If you make a list of reasons for Luffy to truly pursue Doffy ,in terms of the information luffy has been exposed to, u'd prolly come to a conclusion that luffy did not have TOO many valid reasonto take down doffy( since luffy had little to no knowledge about doffy position). Basically what i am saying is Oda sacrificed character development in order to give a better exposition of the story.If luffy cared about such things Oda would have to portray that emotion in much greater detail than the black/white thinking luffy displays now and inturn we would prolly get less dynamic characters in the future. I know the argument is full of holes and shit but im too lazy to type out an entire essay on the story mechanics of one piece. about the 2nd question the WGs reformation is pretty huge and i dont think luffys primary motive will be reformation but another sub plot exsisting within that arc. the reformation part would prolly be handled by the rev or even better a new SH whos dream is a better WG"
OnePiece,3drmf1,nocheslas,4,Sun Jul 19 10:43:43 2015 UTC,"He won't care but in typical luffy manner other circumstances will lead to him inadvertently solving the main problem, example, wanting to help Rebecca and in turn dressrosa simply because she bought him lunch..... Even though she tried to kill him. That's why you gotta love luffy."
OnePiece,3drmf1,HomoRapien,0,Sun Jul 19 04:25:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but wouldn't it be better for once if he would actually care?  The whole doing it for a Nakama/Brother has already been done   If he just does it for Sabo or Robin again then that wouldn't be very satisfying in my opinion
OnePiece,3drmf1,Slysteeler,2,Sun Jul 19 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"Because it's important to robin, it will be important to Luffy."
OnePiece,3drmf1,localafrican,0,Sat Jul 18 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"Gasp, does this mean we'll get another Robin-based arc??"
OnePiece,3drmf1,rmw6190,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:22:23 2015 UTC,How is that a bad thing?
OnePiece,3drmf1,rmw6190,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:14:29 2015 UTC,Nope. I can guarantee Luffy will fall asleep when all that stuff is finally revealed.
OnePiece,3drmf1,TheTriggerOfSol,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:33:11 2015 UTC,Probably he'll just be forced into helping them out. Like the WG captures Dragon or Sabo or both and then he has to go and save them.
OnePiece,3drmf1,KazROFL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:48:41 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll care much and that's what will make him such a different Pirate King than Roger. Roger seemed motivated to learn as much as he could during his life and figured being a pirate was the best way to do it. Luffy is motivated by adventure and realizes that being a pirate.
OnePiece,3drmf1,TheTriggerOfSol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:59 2015 UTC,no he wont. He will care about whats on the rio ponelgyph since robin will care. But he doesnt care about the revolutionaries(besides sabo and ivankov).   here is a good example of how he feels about anything else. He doesnt care about the world unless it affects him or his crew. I wouldnt be surprised if the revolutionaries are actually villains at this point. It would be a good plot twist.
