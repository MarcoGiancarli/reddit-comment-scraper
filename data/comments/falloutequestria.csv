falloutequestria,3dpg13,AmethystWind,6,Sat Jul 18 04:34:41 2015 UTC,How did the idea of 'Two-kick Rip' come about in the first place? What was the inspiration for the character?
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,3,Sat Jul 18 09:30:27 2015 UTC,"So, that's gonna take a bit of background on what was happening when I found Fallout Equestria.  I've always had an issue with headaches. There's just this constant ache. I used to take quite a lot of ibuprofen to deal with it, and that led to me finding out what happens when you take that without food for extended periods of time. Acute gastritis, where my stomach tried devouring itself and I was in constant pain for about two months, forced awake by pain for days at a time. Couldn't take painkillers for it, because that caused it.   So I found FoE, and read it in what was essentially one sitting. 3 days. I'd been playing the Fallout games since the first came out, and had been hesitant to read FoE, but was glad I finally did. After that, I was kept awake by pain and FoE stuck on my brain. I'd dabbled in writing before, but always a page or two before I quit. I had to do something for FoE.  Most of that time is a blur, but I used my love of shotguns, and my want to make the pain stop as inspiration. From there, it was basically molding a character through my delirious state. I think the fact that I was mentally broken when I made him lent a lot to the foundations of Ripple and Two Kick.  With the two characters came a lot of how I see the world. I wouldn't say they were based on my personality, but there is always the front that I keep up every day, and then there are the thoughts that go through my head. Acting on many of them would be quite bad, and probably lead to serious jail time. That little voice that always wonders what would happen if you pushed someone at the bus stop as the bus came up. That's Two Kick. Ripple is the control voice, saying ""No, that would be bad. Don't do that.""  Plus, ya know, ballistic fists are awesome and needed to go on a pony."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,volrathxp,3,Sat Jul 18 09:58:32 2015 UTC,"How did Cinder Trails come about?  For that matter, the rest of the Paragons?  I'm a big fan of Massacre, as you well know.  :)  I've often always thought that good villains are the best part of any story, and yours is no exception.  I've always touted ""Guise"" as one of my most favorite FoE sidefics, and it was the primary cast of villains that really drew me into it.  It was actually the Paragons that led me to create the Sins in ""Starlight""."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,3,Sat Jul 18 13:23:22 2015 UTC,"With Cinder, I felt that Two Kick really needed an ex. Someone strong enough that he couldn't take in a fight without really letting loose.   I'd just finished watching Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood also. I'd been a long time fan of FMA, and Brotherhood had me thinking along the lines of non-firearm weapons. So yeah, there's a little bit of Roy Mustang in the mix with Cinder.  FMA and Trigun are two of my favorite mangas, and they both have a very cool rogues gallery. That was what I felt I needed to go up against Ripple, since I'd already decided that in game terms he was already near max level. Too powerful for your run of the mill mook.  Their personalities and backgrounds came out of the primary theme of Guise, which is 'family'. They had all, with the exception of Flurry, grown up with Ripple. That didn't mean they had to like him, and he them, but there was history there. These were all kids from a small town that walked into the apocalypse, and reacted to it as their competitive upbringings had taught them. If Hate's mom hadn't been killed by raiders, they very well could have become a shining beacon in the wasteland.  Hate was the first one I came up with. I needed a charismatic villain, but one still powerful enough in a fight to hold together a town of raiders. A real monster's monster.  Cinder came next. Magically controlled fire doesn't have a lot of limitations, and I very quickly found that I'd made a character too powerful to reasonably defeat. There are a few possibilities, but thats still a problem I tackle to this day.  Sweeps was my reaction to LittlePip weaponizing a freight car. If she could do that, then why couldn't a unicorn just float all of the guns? I do regret killing her so fast. I wanted to do more with her.  Holepunch was the nerd of the group. Moreso than Epiphany. He was always more of a loner, and just a little inspired by Doctor Octopus.  Flurry... well, I just needed a family member for Fluster. It gave me a great chance to play with the mystery behind Fluster, that she was a pegasus. What would drive a pegasus to strap down their wings and live underground? Severe trauma, and thats what Flurry was made to do. I was definitely thinking of the movie Pitch Black when I came up with how she worked.  Massacre, despite what many think, wasn't based on Bane. The Bane mask is just one of the best ways to get a combat drug into a character in a cool way. I've always liked the idea of a character that can actively regenerate while fighting. The berserker character is one that I tend to play in video games. Get in close, and kill everything before it can kill me.  Skyline was going to be named Longshot at first, but that name is just a little overused. The Paragon's needed a sniper, and a sniper is at their best when they are unseen. Thats why it took so long for her to show up aside from taking shots at a distance. With her being Ripple's sister, I knew that not all of the Paragons had to die. Some of them could be turned away from that path, and I intentionally made her the least violent of them for that reason. She was just the little sister following in her brother's footsteps.  Epiphany was the scientist I needed to make the whole plot and some of the character gimmicks work. Rampage would never have been smart enough to come up with his regen drugs himself. The black boxes were this great, eldritch power and they needed to be studied and harnessed. He was my mad scientist. Given the power to manipulate reality and biology, I had the means to make Massacre super hard to kill, make the black boxes work in unison to bring Pandemonium back, and create my love letter to the 1982 film The Thing (my favorite movie.)   I was a little sad that the last Paragon never made it into the story. Her name was Feral. She was the lovey dovey Fluttershy type at first, wanting to love all the plants and animals. Early in their escape from Stable 87, when the stable ponies were living harmoniously with the town of Anchor, she got her hooves on some killing joke. It made her a pony/timberwolf hybrid. Hate made her a Paragon, but she was driven insane by the constant pain of that fusion and ran into the woods. Bringing her in would have completely changed how the Bone Forest encounter went, and it just didn't feel right."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,TheDoctorHam,3,Sat Jul 18 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"So, better late than never, but if you were to do something over about your story, would you?  Given the opportunity to write it again from scratch, is there something you'd want to change?"
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,2,Mon Jul 20 03:30:53 2015 UTC,"I was never happy with the entire The End chapter. It felt shoehorned in, no matter how many times I tried rewriting it.  I also would have Sweeps alive for much longer. It definitely felt like I underused her for how much I liked her."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Shady_Steps,2,Mon Jul 20 03:44:31 2015 UTC,Okay what would your advice be fore writing in the Fallout Equstria Universe?
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,3,Sat Jul 18 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say that a good knowledge of both the original story and the games themselves are both boons. Also imperative seems to be having knowledgeable friends in the community that you can bounce ideas off of, and that can check your work; editors and prereaders, both are of great benefit. Finding them is tricky, but it pays off in the long run.  Another, possibly more important thing, is to build the right characters and party for the setting. Its just like playing one of the games. With a large party of characters, you need to ramp up the difficulty of what they're facing or split them up. I found that my characters were too powerful to fight full on against their enemies, so that's why Ripple, Ashred, and Ivory, my heavy hitters, were never really all present when the shooty shooty started."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,2,Sat Jul 18 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"Right now, I'm going to bed. I'll be back on in about 8 hours, when I'll get right to any questions. Staying near my computer all day then, so ask away."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,CourierOfTheWastes,2,Sat Jul 18 11:18:30 2015 UTC,Your story seemed to pair with morality of property to me. Is that weird?  What were your favorite parts of the games?
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,3,Sat Jul 18 12:23:44 2015 UTC,"I've heard that, but I've never read Morality, or talked to leadhead as far as I know. That one's pure coincidence.   As for the games... I've been playing them since the first Fallout came out in '97. There are just so many moments, so I'll just name a few.  One moment that still stands out to me is playing all the ends in New Reno in Fallout 2. If you manipulate everything just right, you can be a Made Man for 4 of the 5 crime families, and that always made me chuckle.   Then there's Fallout 3. Stepping out into the wasteland that I'd only looked down at for years and seeing it in first person in all of its blasted glory... that moment still shines bright in my memory.  The companions also get quite a lot of my attention. My dislike of Tandi in the first game has spread into my dislike of the NCR as a whole. Gorris was just too cool for words, and seeing my old pal Marcus show up in New Vegas just made me smile for days. Seeing Cassidy's daughter out on her own, trying to run a caravan business made me think that he'd be proud of her.  And it can't be left unsaid that Dogmeat is my best friend forever."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,CourierOfTheWastes,2,Sat Jul 18 20:10:10 2015 UTC,I wanted to ask more about your time in new Vegas.
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,3,Sat Jul 18 23:26:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, New Vegas. Played a ton of it, probably 400 hours between PC and 360, but I think what stood out most to me was when I actually did my Ripple playthrough. I'd never actually given unarmed a try, and quickly found that unarmed with a shotgun for backup is a god build, provided you have enough drugs to back it up.  I felt that NV, though the mechanics were improved over 3, was the weaker of the two games. It didn't have many memorable set pieces outside of the DLCs (of which Dead Money was easily my favorite).   True, I did use the bullet amnesia start point that eventually became so ubiquitous with FoE sidefiction, but it was more because I'm a fan of in media res than any personal connection with the Courier (Though I am professionally a courier IRL...)."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,RoMSie,2,Sat Jul 18 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna come out and say I completely agree. Obsidian has a history with being forced to short release times and coming out with something fairly remote of finished (KotOR2 for example). I really like their work, I just wish more of it ended up in the final product.  Also, Dead Money was a diamond, beautiful in every facet. Aside from the poor optimization in the villa worldspace, of course."
falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,2,Sun Jul 19 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"Besides your love of shotgun, what was your inspiration(s) for Broken ?  Was it just a cool broken gun? Or something with a meaning?"
falloutequestria,3dpg13,RoMSie,5,Sun Jul 19 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"I felt that Ripple needed something special aside from his signature hoofguns to help him kill pones. I knew that he wouldn't have use for something long range, and he needed a durable weapon, so that meant shotgun.   I was writing a story, and maybe I'll finish it sometime, about Broken that was a tell all. I did tell myself that if anyone asked, I'd tell here though.  Broken is a soul jar. That frequent speculation is correct.  It was made by a gunsmith during the war, right before the balefire fell. He had been in love with a zebra, and dismayed when she had been taken to a camp at the height of the war. When he learned that she had died in the camp, days before the end of the war, he went into a rage. While tearing through his home, he found a short manuscript that the zebra had kept hidden. It showed how to put part of one's self into an item, granting it powers.  He made Broken out of himself and a shotgun. He took the part of him that wanted revenge, and used the weapon as its container. As he was readying himself to go out and seek that revenge, the bombs fell.  Skip forward a couple hundred years, and a young unicorn stumbles across it while searching through the ruins of Hornsmith. He then uses it to kill and maim ponies as he rises to be the second of the Paragons, Two Kick."

falloutequestria,3dpg13,Fallingsnow57,2,Sun Jul 19 04:56:19 2015 UTC,"Ash, Cutter, and Fraya all came from Philly as I recall. They're dad was a Talon, and raised them to be Talons. Fraya was happy with the roll her father chose for her, but Ash and Cutter weren't. They were more ambitious, and felt that they could do much better by themselves if they weren't around other griffins. Supply and demand.  They did well in Hornsmith until they botched a job that Hate put up for them, that of getting one of the cubes for him. They got in an argument about hazard pay, and Hate ordered both of them shot. Ash got away, but Cutter was shot out of the sky."

The isolation and being in a cold part of the world, has allowed the unicorns to keep their long tails and be a bit more fuzzy than their mainland equestrian counterparts. (as traditionally, unicorns were drawn with long tails)   Or so at least goes my shitty headcannon.  So in a FOE setting, I suppose he would be interested in arcano-tech. so maybe have him doing maintenance on a plasma rifle, that has a cold blue glow instead of the typical baleful green, with his cutie mark emblazoned on the stock?  I'm really not good at imagining these things, but I would be honored if you chose to do something with my character as I am a long time fan of your art!"

My OC Sick Rhymes is a pre war ghoul who worked for the MAS, him and his team were developing top secret projects based on Temporal Magic (timey wimey stuff, and alternate dimension type research) the bombs dropped and the world ended.  However his research didn´t, and Slick still believes he can help change things, through the old world belief that friendship is magic.  The idea I would like for the pic is simple enough, and it´s this one part in the rp where Team Temporal (aka Slick and friends) met Blackjack from Project Horizons, and Slick and her got drunk and made complete tits of themselves haha  So I´d quite like a pic of my OC and Blackjack just, being drunk and merry together, maybe brohoofing i don´t know, I leave creative liberties up to you.

His ancestral tribe tried to keep to themselves (as batponies were wont to do in the years following the war) and he's one of the few who are willing to venture out and trade with civilization. He's adapted to 'civilized' life to a certain degree by growing adept with a sniper rifle and discovering a certain proficiency for tinkering, but nonetheless much prefers his antiquated, handed down, and oft-repaired Luna's Guard armor and spear.  In terms of setting, He'd probably be perched in a tree at night, watching the glow of a far off settlement.  Love your stuff man!"

falloutequestria,3cvolv,throwawayaccount997,8,Sat Jul 11 13:49:58 2015 UTC,I am entirely new to Fallout Equestria and in no way do I have knowledge beyond the fact that it's a crossover between MLP and Fallout.  What am I missing out on?
falloutequestria,3cvolv,meditonsin,12,Sat Jul 11 05:11:09 2015 UTC,"Imagine the show had ended/things had stayed as they were at some point during season two. Now imagine that Equestria went through an industrial revolution in the years after, with lots of new technology that required lots of power, in the form of coal, which Equestria apparently didn't have much of.  What they did have, though, was gems, which incidentally the neighboring zebras needed to work their magic and even more incidentally, they had coal to spare. So, natually, they traded. But then the relationship between the two nations deteriorated and trade eventually stopped, even though both countries relied on the resources of the other.  Who fired the first shot? No one knows. But what followed was a war that eventually escalated to their equivalent of a nuclear holocaust.  200 years later, a young unicorn mare leaves her Stalbe (Vault) in pursuit of a silly crush, which quickly takes the back seat in favour of survival, as she finds herself in a wasteland where almost everyone and everything wants to kill her or worse.  The first creature she meets that doesn't want to horribly murder her tells her that to survive out there she'd need three things: Weapons, a bit of know-how and friends.  What follows is the epic adventure of Littlepip who, after more or less aimlessly wandering the wastes for a while, gets caught up in events that are affecting all of what's left of Equestria. And during her travel, she picks up bits and pieces of information on what happened to Equestria and many of the characters you know from the show during the war."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,SevenCell,6,Sat Jul 11 12:20:19 2015 UTC,"""What am I missing out on?"" Well, briefly and certainly not exhaustively:   The setting that rises above and beyond its parents to become something greater than MLP or Fallout. The most 3-dimensional, fallible characters that I have ever, ever seen, barring Iain M Banks. The experience of watching a writer grow visibly alongside her story, attempting, implementing and perfecting new skills. You know how other stories have Chekov's guns? Big, profound reveals from little clues? Like Harry Potter? Yeah, no. We have Chekov's cascades. Extreme emotional upheaval (because there is no option, you will get invested heart and soul in these characters). Most of all, though, it's sneaky and it's clever. You know at the end of TV episodes, in practically every show for kids, they always come right out and say their moral? FoE is different. There are a couple of times when it breaks and talks directly to the reader - most of the time it works because it's all intense and stuff; a couple of times it's just preachy - but it's never about it's main message. FoE is in my opinion one of the most coherent explorations of friendship and camaraderie of today, certainly that I've ever read. It just cheats a bit and uses a very bleak and extreme setting to accelerate all the emotional stuff, rather than building to the same dramatic conclusions through more relatable everyday stuff (and it's still 600K+ words). For all its purple prose and its melodrama (which is a lot, let's be honest), the end result is a resounding show, and not tell, purely on the value of true friendship.   Set out a weekend and leave this place alone until you've read it (this is NOT a story you want spoiled). You'll have a blast.   Eventually. To begin with, it's kind of a chore. Like I say, the writer matures throughout, but the starting point is not the best. Some issues that I urge you to push through, because they do get better:    The premise is stupid. I completely agree. Happy, cheerful technicolour horses mixed with hyperviolent post-apocalypse - the premise is moronic. You get used to it, and it finds its own identity quite quickly. The writing style, to begin with, is awful. There are a couple of lines that give Fifty Shades a run for its money. That gets better to, mainly because the author stops trying to write, and just tells the story - like Harry Potter style, but more. The end result is a very distinctive, plain style, that really just comes off as passionate. But to begin with, yeah, just have a laugh with it. It's a long story. Some people say it's artificially bloated - I disrespectfully disagree, because they're wrong, but it is a very, very long story. Read it in as few sittings as possible - concentrated FoE is best FoE.   When you're done, take a couple of days to collect yourself, and come back here. We'll be waiting with tissues, lively discussion, and mounds and mounds of fan-fanfiction."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bgkzero,4,Sat Jul 11 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty meditonsin nailed it on the head pretty well. There are also side stories, such as Pink Eyes (which we also had a printing of). They exist independently of the main story, yet set in the same universe.   There are hundreds online, so if you're not interested in Littlepip's quest, you can find what you want in a variety of adventures of different characters, romances, heroes, villains, or just gruesome Fallout shenanigans.  (although Littlepip's main story is pretty freakin cool)"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,volrathxp,4,Sat Jul 11 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"Given the relative success of the Pink Eyes printing, do you guys think you would do other stories that are already completed if there is enough interest?"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,yetanothername,4,Sat Jul 11 14:15:18 2015 UTC,"We are open to print any story as long as there is enough interest, however they must be completed first.  Who would want to buy an incomplete book?  (That misprinted ""write your own FoE side story"" edition aside)"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,volrathxp,3,Sat Jul 11 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"Sure.  That was the obvious intent that it would only apply to stories that are already completed.  I just know that I've had a few of my own readers ask about a printing for Starlight, so I thought I would ask.  Would be awesome to see ""Guise of Chaos"" get the treatment too.  :D"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,Kanzuke,6,Sat Jul 11 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"First things first, thank you all so much for your work. I had no idea there was a printing going on until I saw the 5 finished books on EQD, and when the second printing fell through thanks to PayPal it looked like I'd never see a physical copy. So I'm glad to be sat here today with Fallout Equestria and Pink Eyes sat on the shelf above me.  So, two questions for you.  I've heard the other side-stories you're considering are Murky Number 7, Heroes and Project Horizons, but with those stories approaching 1 Mill, 500k and God Knows respectively, have you any plans as to how you'll print them? Number of books, still hardcover, chapter art included, etc  Have any of you considered printing fics outside of Fallout? It's not hard to find a few that would be popular enough, I know I'd love to see Eakin's Hard Reset Trilogy in print."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,zemming,4,Sat Jul 11 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for supporting the project! I'm glad you were able to get a copy of FoE and Pink Eyes.  Those definitely are the more popular side stories, so we have looked into them. Horizons has the most potential since it's actually close to being finished. It would have to be split into 5 books due to its length. Definitely would be hardcover, and as long as we have time we probably would have dust jackets. But I don't think chapter art will happen unless we organized an entire team of artists. It would be too much work for one person.   There's still a couple more things we want to do within the Fallout fandom before we worry too much about printing other fics."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,Kanzuke,3,Sat Jul 11 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I had no idea Horizons was so far along. I'd love to read that through for the first time on paper, enough to buy five books worth of it :D"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,AmethystWind,4,Sat Jul 11 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"What made you guys decide to do a physical printing of a fanfic in the first place? It's the first time I've seen it done where it wasn't changed from fanfic to 'original' story in the process (think 50 Shades of Grey being originally Twilight fanfiction that was touted as its own story after having all references removed), but rather simply transferring what is usually internet-only onto a physical medium?"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,yetanothername,7,Sat Jul 11 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"About three years ago the original group printed a five copy set of Fo:E. I learned about the project after their sign up and waited to get my own copy --- which I wanted because I read the story originally on my Moto Droid and I wanted to reread it and IMO I like paper better than screens to read a story.  Their second printing attempt went south due to issues with PayPal and stagnated for about a year, at which point myself, /u/mrc0mmand and another gentleman were tired of not having books and decided to attempt another printing, which brought to life the two volume edition we made last year.  tl;dr: I wanted one because books are wonderful"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,5,Sat Jul 11 15:59:22 2015 UTC,"Because real books are awesome. It's actually really cool to have your own copy of a story that you read online in book form. Personally, I don't know what the original people thought whenever they printed FoE for the first time, but I do know that the second printing happened because some people on the FoE Book IRC wanted books of their own, but they couldn't get them. So what did they do? They made their own books."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bgkzero,5,Sat Jul 11 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"FoE is one of the highest praised MLP fanfictions, with its stellar fusion of two fictional universes and enormous following. It was great enough for people to write their own side stories, and take the potential of the original story and worldbuild exponentially.   A print project was also done for Past Sins by Pen Stroke, so I don't think it's much surprise that the fandom would pounce at the opportunity to hold one of their favorite stories in their hands."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,3,Sat Jul 11 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"I do believe, though, that the original FoE Printing was before the first printing of Past Sins."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bgkzero,4,Sat Jul 11 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, factual accuracy. Who needs it anyway? :P"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,2,Sat Jul 11 16:15:35 2015 UTC,Everyone does. Well... except for MLP. That show has a lot of weird time stuff. There's not too much consistency...
falloutequestria,3cvolv,wildedge,4,Sat Jul 11 16:55:50 2015 UTC,When/where/how can I buy these books?
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,5,Sat Jul 11 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"If you're going to BronyCon, or TrotCon, you can find Zemming and he'll have a few copies of Pink Eyes for sale. Otherwise, you'll have to wait to get another copy... if we do a reprint of FoE and Pink Eyes."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,yetanothername,5,Sat Jul 11 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"At this point we have no plans to reprint the books and offer them for sale in a bulk form.  You can download the five pdf files from the original team and print/bind them yourselfs, but be aware that this will be somewhat expensive as low-volume production runs cost more per unit than high-volume runs.  Otherwise, sometimes books show up on eBay to bid on."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,klstixbro,4,Sat Jul 11 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"We're not currently printing any more at the moment, sorry. We are, however, looking into printing more books in the future. Keep an eye on http://book.fallout-equestria.com if you want to know when we do the next printing run.  If you feel you absolutely must have the books as soon as possible, however, you can also keep an eye on eBay and similar auction sites. There's usually someone who puts up a set of one of the printing runs every now and again. I will warn you though, those sets usually go up into the hundreds of dollars, far more than what we charge."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,wildedge,5,Sat Jul 11 18:46:06 2015 UTC,Also how do you guys handle grammar Nazis?   What's the strangest request for these books so far?
falloutequestria,3cvolv,yetanothername,4,Sat Jul 11 18:36:29 2015 UTC,We have a team of six editors ;)
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bgkzero,2,Sat Jul 11 18:42:40 2015 UTC,How do we handle grammar Nazis? We are grammar Nazis! It's necessary to be one to be an efficient editor
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,4,Sat Jul 11 18:47:25 2015 UTC,All of the editors are Grammar Nazis :P Just ask Zemming.
falloutequestria,3cvolv,klstixbro,4,Sat Jul 11 18:49:41 2015 UTC,"Wiht extreem prejewdees.  In all honesty though, as I've grown as a writer my desire to criticize the linguistics skills of others has faded. I had to learn on my own that people don't always use perfect English on the Internet, and that that's okay. I usually find grammar nazis are people who themselves don't have complete control over our language, and merely use it as a means to belittle and berate others. I usually let them be. They'll eventually either learn on their own, or they'll have someone put them in their place where it really matters—the classroom.  As for your other question: though it wasn't technically a request, I did see someone on our Facebook page start a petition to have us do another printing run. It fell out after less than 24 hours. I thought it was cool that he cared enough to want us to do another printing run, so I didn't think it was too upsetting.  Edit: Oh yeah, also what they said. When it comes to editing, you have to be grammar Hitler."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bgkzero,3,Sat Jul 11 19:01:14 2015 UTC,We won't stop until unnecessary semicolons are eradicated from a fic
falloutequestria,3cvolv,klstixbro,4,Sat Jul 11 19:07:31 2015 UTC,The ellipses...  THE ELLIPSES...!!!
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,3,Sat Jul 11 19:10:28 2015 UTC,It wasn't really semicolons. I do believe it was mainly colons. Those things were horrible...
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,3,Sat Jul 11 20:21:37 2015 UTC,We have a Facebook page?
falloutequestria,3cvolv,zemming,3,Sat Jul 11 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"There is an unofficial Facebook page for Fallout Equestria fans. It's not related to the project.   For project information, always check http://book.fallout-equestria.com/"

falloutequestria,3cvolv,SevenCell,4,Sat Jul 11 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, thanks for doing this, and thanks as well for the mountains of work you've put into these books. I think I was one of the last ever to get the 2nd printing, and I've treasured them since.  I have to ask, though: would it really have been that hard to edit them a bit? Even just a basic spellcheck? I've heard the ""Tiny/Tinny"" example before as to why Kkat has been so resistant to it in the past, but this is print! This is legitimate, this is what people will find 200 years after our own end of the world. I understand it would have been a lot of extra work, but I think the improvements to Book 5 alone would have been worth it.  Anyway, genuine question: do you have any projects on the go right now, or are you just waiting for Murky/Horizons to finish?   Thanks again."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,yetanothername,5,Sat Jul 11 20:26:34 2015 UTC,When we contacted KKat initially for the project she gave us relatively few restrictions on what we could or could not do and changing the main story text in any way was one of the few restrictions.
falloutequestria,3cvolv,bathroomstahl,5,Sat Jul 11 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"First off, as yetanothername said, Kkat did not let us edit the original FoE. Personally, I do wish she let us edit it, but I might be a bit biased here... Anyway, moving on, we are currently waiting for Murky Number Seven and Project Horizons to finish before we do anything with them. I still say that I'd love to have a printing of both :P"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,klstixbro,2,Sat Jul 11 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"Hey Seven!  To answer your initial question: it wasn't a matter of work, it's simply that the team was asked by kkat not to edit the original story whatsoever, which is totally understandable. It's her story, and she gets the first and last say as to what we do with it. Heck, if I were her, I'm not sure I'd want a weirdo like myself messing around with it either.   To answer your next question: at the moment we're only in the contemplative stage of things. We've looked at a few different stories and have done some quick back-of-the-napkin math to determine just how we might be able to pull a print of them off. I'm certain we'll decide on something soon (maybe)."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,elementaryofbravery,5,Sat Jul 11 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"First I would like to say that what you guys have pulled of is amazing. I had bought a copy of pink eyes from you guys and it is better than I hoped. That leads me to my question. Since I have a copy of pink eyes, must I buy another copy to get the original fallout equestria? What I meen is do I have to buy both books? Or can I just buy the one I want."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,zemming,3,Sat Jul 11 22:06:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for supporting the project! I'm glad you like your copy of Pink Eyes.   Each printing is just for one story, so you wouldn't need to buy another copy of Pink Eyes, if that's what you're asking. But we don't have any more copies of Fallout Equestria for sale. You'll have to wait for another printing."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,elementaryofbravery,3,Sat Jul 11 22:19:10 2015 UTC,Oops. I must have made a mistake. I thought you were doing another printing of both the original and pink eyes. Wow I feel like an idiot. Never mind what I said earlier.
falloutequestria,3cvolv,GammaDK,3,Sun Jul 12 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"As everypony else is saying, I want to express my thanks for printing up both Fo:E and Pink Eyes!  I love my copies to death, and I can't wait to see what you guys put out next! (even if it IS a third printing, still going to get it!)  As for my question, everyone keeps asking if you'll do PH or Murkey.   What I want to know is, given there were zero limitations to printing, what Fo:E story would each of you WANT to print?  Doesn't have to be one of the main fics, or completed, and could even be a one shot.  I'm just curious as to what out there you consider good enough to print in your eyes!"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,mrc0mmand,4,Sat Jul 11 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for the support!  As for the question - that's a hard one. Unfortunately, I've read only four FoE stories so far and all of them are the 'big ones'. Nevertheless, I'd like to see almost any finished FoE story in 'dead tree form', because books are awesome!  Anyway, it's not about what story we like, but what story you like - because without you, none of this would've been possible!"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,klstixbro,3,Sat Jul 11 23:18:45 2015 UTC,"Hey Gamma! Thanks for the kind words!  As for your question: When it comes to the big FOE fics, the only ones that I've read besides the main story are PH and Pink Eyes. So, using the process of elimination, only PH remains. I do want to check out some of the other fics, though. Both MN7 and Heroes look like amazing stories."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,GammaDK,3,Sun Jul 12 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"I've thoroughly enjoyed Heroes, and it's still one of my favorite Fo:E stories to date!  However, if you're also looking for stuff to read, you might want to give Hnetu's Treasure Hunting a chance!  I've really enjoyed it as well, and it's now featured on Equestria Daily!"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,klstixbro,3,Sun Jul 12 02:37:58 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, I've been hearing lots of good things about Treasure Hunting. I definitely need to check that out."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,Chica_Fnaf,5,Sun Jul 12 04:47:45 2015 UTC,"Do you plan to puplish any other, maybe not so big side stories?"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,zemming,3,Sun Jul 12 01:05:14 2015 UTC,Maybe. Right now our focus is on the larger fics since we want as many people as possible to sign up; which makes the books cost less for everyone.
falloutequestria,3cvolv,mlp-NovelIdea,4,Sun Jul 12 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your hard work printing a novel longer than War and Peace, from everyone at the Manehattan Project.  I really want to ask about printing number three, but I'll be good. (And because you've already answered that question a few dozen times) ;)"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,zemming,3,Sun Jul 12 01:30:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for your support!   Good luck with Manehatten Project. Looks like you guys have quite a full team working on it :)
falloutequestria,3cvolv,mlp-NovelIdea,2,Sun Jul 12 02:58:52 2015 UTC,"Looks can sometimes be deceiving, but thank you nonetheless!"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,Heather_Trails,3,Mon Jul 13 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"I was very lucky to get one of the leftover copies of Pink Eyes, thankfully my financial situation changed in time for me to get one and it is beautiful! Still a few typos, but I read it in a day and will probably read it again and again. Now I just need the original FOE and Project Horizons.  Along the PH line, do you guys think you'll be printing the entire thing off in one go or are you going to break it up and do book one first and then the next? I'm guessing it'll be around 3 books. Thing is long...  Also if you need another typo finder... hi! I did that for a few Ranma 1/2 fanfic writers once upon a time... :p"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,klstixbro,3,Sun Jul 12 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"Hey Heather! Glad to hear you managed to snag a copy of Pink Eyes!  To answer your question: we've discussed it somewhat and decided that, if we were to do a PH print, we'd split it up into five different books and sell the whole set simultaneously.  As for editing: I'm not sure whether or not we'll need more editors for future printings. I'm not really the one who decides that sort of thing. However, I do know that if we were to need more editors, we'd definitely put out a request on http://book.fallout-equestria.com. If you're interested in being an editor on the project, make sure you keep your eyes on that site."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,Heather_Trails,2,Sun Jul 12 17:05:10 2015 UTC,Good to know! Thanks a bunch!
falloutequestria,3cvolv,Meluch,4,Mon Jul 13 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"What were the legalities of printing such books? As a fanfic writer, it certainly interests me for my own work, but I have no desire to have Hasbro sending me C&D letters.   Another question. How did you go about finding the printers for your runs? What were the criteria that you looked for? How did they respond to printing small runs of a fan fiction book?"
falloutequestria,3cvolv,zemming,3,Sat Jul 11 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend you seek you own legal council to sate your interest.   That said, the FoE Book Project exists to facilitate the creation, production, and distribution of amateur author's works to their dedicated fans. Ultimately we're an intermediary, just pooling people's money to buy books in bulk.   I don't remember how I found our current printer other than just a lot of research online. One of the biggest things I was looking for was a local company, since that reduced our freight costs. Then it was just a matter of reaching out with a RFQ.   Really no one cares what you're printing. Not in a negative manner, it's just business. And ""small"" is a relative term; we partner with a printer who is right for our size."
falloutequestria,3cvolv,Meluch,3,Sun Jul 12 02:47:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for your response! Have you ever had any trouble from Hasbro?
falloutequestria,3cvolv,zemming,3,Sun Jul 12 02:59:12 2015 UTC,So far the project has been running smoothly.

falloutequestria,3cqezh,CorvusProductions,3,Thu Jul 9 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad you did this.  I'm terrible at reading song lyrics that appear in books. Unless I already know the tune and meter its set to, my brain just fails to take it in."
falloutequestria,3cqezh,finalsight618,2,Fri Jul 10 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I could help with that! More than anything, putting a bit of context emotional context to the words was what I wanted to accomplish. I know it's not the canon song from the story, but if I could help share that context with one or two listeners, I feel like I've helped out the wasteland in some small way or another.  It was a big challenge composing a song around existing lyrics, but it was a fun way to approach a song! As I said, I did have to modify the lyrics a bit, I hope Kkat senpai doesn't mind. _;"
falloutequestria,3cqezh,MixolydianGrey,3,Fri Jul 10 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"I like the end of that chord progression. It's something like... Gm7 Ebmaj7 Ebm, right? I hear sevenths and I hear a IV iv vi or a IV iv I cadence but I can't really pick out the notes.  I can only think of one comment as far as criticism goes. The end of the song sort of disappears. But I'm used to stupid cheesy 80's music where every song ends by fading a guitar solo or a chorus, and I'm used to big band swing where every song ends on a dramatic major chord. So that's probably more of a subjective taste sort of thing.  The mixing is pretty good and everything blends nicely. I like the way each instrument makes a subtle contribution to the overall mood.  How would you feel about collaborating? I do guitars and things. I can send you some Dropbox links or something so you can get an idea of what I do."
falloutequestria,3cqezh,Harakou,2,Fri Jul 10 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"As far as the chord progression, I could probably figure out what I was doing if I cared enough to go back and analyze the chord shapes I was using in the tuning I was in, but that's not something I tend to do. I know a fair amount about music theory, but I try not to approach my own music with that in mind. (also, I'm lazy!)  More than anything, I wanted the mix to sound really honest, which is why I left the ambient room noise in at the beginning of the track (as it was recorded in my bedroom). I do appreciate the feedback about the ending! I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to finish this piece, because it was mostly about the lyrics to begin with. I wanted the instrumental portion to be just enough to supplement atmosphere, so I decided to just let it fade out. However, thinking about this piece as an allegory for FoE, a solid ending with a nice major chord would definitely have been appropriate. :)  As for collaboration, I'm the type of person who is normally always down to make music with new friends. However, I find myself with a bunch of work on my plate at the moment. In addition to being the Manehattan Project's music director and in house composer, I'm also the newest member of the Wasteland Wailers, and I'm doing soundtrack for the Overmare Studios' game. I've hardly had time to leave the house lately! But feel free to send me a private message here on Reddit in a month or so, I'd be happy to make some music if my workload has lessened a bit! Thanks again for listening, and for your kind words!"
falloutequestria,3cqezh,Fadlanu,3,Fri Jul 10 02:01:06 2015 UTC,I've wanted to hear someone take these lyrics on ever since I first read them. I'm really happy to hear this.

I think this one will be going on the DJ Pon3 radio station in the Manehattan Project's ""Gardens of Equestria"", but that doesn't necessarily mean that TOmS/The Wasteland Wailers couldn't use it. I just don't know that they'd want to. :) We'll see, there's a lot of other music to be made for both projects.  And thank you for your words of encouragement!

falloutequestria,3cdqav,Lunaisbestpony42,3,Tue Jul 7 16:05:59 2015 UTC,For a plush that's pretty good.  I remember last year at babscon the plushes being sold by some lady there were going for between 400 and 1200 dollars.
falloutequestria,3cdqav,KaiserVonIkapoc,4,Tue Jul 7 21:05:52 2015 UTC,That was probably Equestrian Plush.  They are one of the best.
falloutequestria,3cdqav,2woToned,5,Tue Jul 7 22:43:37 2015 UTC,Aggie pls.
falloutequestria,3cdqav,LittlePip,4,Tue Jul 7 07:48:22 2015 UTC,It's so plush I am afraid I might cease to be.
falloutequestria,3cbhp3,Shady_Steps,5,Mon Jul 6 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"Okay this is the fourth/fifth fanmade FOE ruleset I've seen, I'll read it now.  Reading it so far, the first thing to jump out at me is the normal things (No Page numbers, there is a linked table of contents however) and rather than post a long list of things I'll limit myself to a few notations  A. Character generation needs work Let me copy the entire section word for word  Characteristics are generated by rolling 2D10 ten times, here is an example.  7, 11, 14, 12, 17, 9, 11, 16, 19. 15  Once you have the ten numbers apply them to whatever Characteristic you wish to build your character, Game Masters may choose to allow a single reroll for any score gained under 10 if they are running a high power game or increasing the Characteristics Generator dice to 3D10  Okay seems simple I roll 20d10 dice in groups of 2d10 for Characteristics... except while Characteristics is mentioned nearly twenty times there's no short easy to refer to list.  Likewise with skills, there is no place for I as a DM or my players to look at see the list of them, then go hunting for definitions.  The Long form breakouts are there but not the short versions.  TL:DR I need at least twenty pages of text to make a character because short form fast versions don't exist yet.   B. Combat seems very easy for low level character to cheese Warfare Range Tests and max them and become perfectly accurate.   Throw yourself all into hitting things in say Shadowrun or D&D and you still have a healthy 20% or more chance to miss totally, here if I'm reading here that a Pegasus could start the game in his mid 40s for Ranged Warfare Tests... except the leveling up sections missing or TBD later or I can't find it.  It goes back to comment 1 the first thing I did was try and make a character then level them up once to see how hard that was.  It was hard, and it seems parts were missing.  C. Is the system base D10 or D100?  The reason I ask was reading the Food section, food is in blocks of 10s and looking at the equipment sheet I see things like -25 Food -25 water for a Fresh Carrot but the Combat Section keeps mentioning a Natural D10.  I assume that's two D10s hit 10 at the same time and not a single D10 hitting nat 10."
falloutequestria,3cbhp3,cptadder,2,Mon Jul 6 23:44:05 2015 UTC,Thanks! be sure to point out any mistakes if you see them!
falloutequestria,3cbhp3,cptadder,3,Tue Jul 7 02:18:43 2015 UTC,Edited with comments
falloutequestria,3cbhp3,E-Squid,3,Tue Jul 7 05:38:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks for the review and yes, I did forget to explain levels and character advancement... I will change that soon, character creation was designed with the assumption that a player would have the Character sheet open in another tab but I see the logic in adding it to the ruleset document too.  B. Combat can't be pushed high that quickly, each time you level up you get 1 point to spend on characteristics so at the late game you can make an accurate character (at the expense of the other characteristics) but early game you will rely on modifiers and situation tactics to fight effectively.  C. Food works on blocks of 50 and requires no rolls? I use a mix of d10 and d100 as this ruleset was made from the ground up to be used online with dicebots."

falloutequestria,3c6nkl,Nu11u5,3,Sun Jul 5 10:27:31 2015 UTC,"Well, between the first and the second printing, there was about a year's worth of time.  A whole lot changed between the printings (The cutting it down to two books took a lot of work) and then they got Pink Eyes printed out not to long ago.  I do assume that IF they are going to do another printing, it wouldn't be announced for another few months or so, if at all."

I know you're very modest, but I also hope you realize what you've done for many readers and writers in this fandom.  In regards to the Fallout 4 video... Well, keep in mind that Todd Howard has lied and exaggerated before when answering questions regarding Bethesda's upcoming titles. Certainly the current-gen hardware should be adequate for open environments and less loadings screens, but be somewhat wary on those promises. Still -- the game looks really good and I love the variety in the environments. Everything isn't a dead, green-tinted, dull landscape anymore."

He doesn't need it.  His story is already immensely popular and he's gone on record himself saying that he doesn't think a featured post does anything for readership, exposure, or comments/likes. The whole point was to give stories not already in the Big 5 a chance to shine."

falloutequestria,3body7,Promptanon,3,Tue Jun 30 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell who is who at the start. Need to say the unicorn is a waitress or something. Thought it was the blankflank for a bit. General confusion. No need for it.    two day’s trip East    That's like, next door for traveling on foot.  I dunno, is this the sort of scale that the game uses?    Only in extremely civilized places do you get an inn or village at the end of every night. Look into the typical travelling merchant's life in feudal Europe or Japan.   Second part is pretty well written.  Whoa whoa whoa.... he heard GUNFIRE, ""we must not be alone""... and he lit the fire anyway? This kid whose parents were killed by raiders? Who isn't as naive as we think? Wut?   That needs some 'splaining. I dunno, some internal conflict about what'st he proper thing to do and then settling on his original order from grumpy... or something.    All wearing some bloody, leather barding. One even had sharp metal spikes on his.   On his what? I know you meant on his barding, but it needs to be worded better.   Maybe just cut ""on his"".    attached to his head by a sliver of Dusty’s brown coat.    Try ""by a thin strip of flesh"".   Or just have her rip it off. Why not?   while he pushed the ear back against his head.   Ah. ok get graphic. ""The ear spurted blood and flopped back. It hung by a thin strip of flesh and bounced against his head as he screamed in panic.""  Also, he has a machine gun and he bites her in the surprise round?    as it drew blood.    You use this phrase twice. Switch it up.   Like... I dunno ""sunk into his flesh"" or something.   ooooooh, that's a nice and brutal ending. Bravo!  Is he thinking dark thoughts about Sunshine?"
falloutequestria,3body7,noonemustknowmysecre,3,Wed Jul 1 04:31:45 2015 UTC,"Oh good, a comment. Let's dive into it.    Hard to tell who is who at the start.   Really? I thought I made it pretty clear. There's the pale pink unicorn that is on his right that left to get his drink, and a yellow mare on his left. And both of those mares are ""full service"" waitresses, if you catch my drift. Felt like the implications of the chat were enough. Oh, and Sunshine isn't a blankflank, that was a bit of poor choice of wording there. She just isn't wearing anything so her flank is literally bare. He looked down at her cutie mark and wasn't a frowny face. I probably could have said that a little better.    two days   Yeah, I wasn't really sure on the distance or the time it would have taken. I thought 20-30ish miles was okay for another town to be, and if they were walking all day they could handle it.    Second part is pretty well written.   Thanks. I'm always worried about the second part because I wanted it to feel kind of fast and confusing during the argument. Also, I felt like I needed to make the Rangers huge assholes because most authors make them too nice. Good to see that you liked it though.    Who isn't as naive as we think?   That's the point. Dusty is incredibly naive, and he trusts Grumpy to do his job and protect him. But at the same time, I could have done more with that scene. I originally was going to use the fire and Dusty as bait because Grumpy would know that the Raiders were following them and that he would try to lure them to him while he was off getting into contact with Zap but they were closer by than he imagined.    but it needs to be worded better.   Agreed.  I felt like Dee not ripping it off completely was grosser than just taking it completely off.   She had Dusty in her 'arms' and he just screamed. Grumpy wasn't stalking in the shadows watching it all go down, he just reacted to what he saw in the moment. Plus, for as good as a shot he is, he might have shot Dusty. That's where my head was at with the scene anyways. But the combat portion always rubbed me a bit on the wrong side, if I were to rewrite it, I'd definitely have cleaned it up a bit more.    use this phrase twice.   Whoops, I'm usually a pretty big stickler on that one. Guess it slipped past my head.   Oh good, I'm glad you liked the ending. It went through a couple of variations before I settled on this one (one was that Dusty was working with the slavers, and so was Grumpy, so they both go to deliver each other, and Grumpy gets taken by them).   Dark thoughts about Sunshine? No, not particularly. He just thinks she talks too much and is kind of a bitch.   But thanks for reading, and commenting. I know authors always appreciate it."

That doesn't mean she's ever come nose-to-barrel with a gun before, though. She could've easily spent her life dealing only with petty thugs that use their hooves and melee weapons."

falloutequestria,3be6ny,LoneWolfMark,5,Sun Jun 28 15:21:56 2015 UTC,Congratulations on getting featured!  Your fic damn good and it was an insanely close run between Sisters and Treasure Hunting for me - it's just a shame we couldn't get two fics featured.   I still need to read your latest chapter and I look forward to seeing more from you in the future!
falloutequestria,3be6ny,SomberPony,3,Sun Jun 28 16:03:53 2015 UTC,Congratulations.  Great job.  Look forward to reading it when Horizons is done.
falloutequestria,3be6ny,RoMSie,2,Sun Jun 28 18:27:20 2015 UTC,Good job for the last two and half (men?) years! It pays off.
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Arowid,10,Sun Jun 28 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"Dang... I was trying like hell to get chapter 7 out before the votes, too.  So much coffee....       To everyone that put effort into this: Thank you.  I can't imagine that reading through all those horse words that quickly was easy.  And organizing all of this must have been a pain, too.  You folks are awesome.  Now then, time for me to get back to editing.  And then it looks like I've got a couple fics to read."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,finalsight618,4,Sun Jun 28 13:08:15 2015 UTC,"I have to admit that i had a little panic this time last week. I was only 2/3rds the way through Treasure Hunting and hadn't even started Sisters.  I had to make the decision to quickly switch to your story, to make sure that I read it in time. Luckily thanks to a few long mid day reading sessions i managed to finish it and then get back to finish Treasure Hunting.   If you had got a new chapter out, you would have made it much harder for me to decide on my votes. As it was I had to do an itemised pro/con list on a napkin."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Arowid,5,Sun Jun 28 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"Aww... Now I really wish I had gotten that chapter out sooner!  It's one of my favorites so far.  Oh well.  My fault for writing slow.  No biggy.  Did you uh... keep that list?  I'd kinda like to get some feedback, particularly of the constructive criticism variety."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,finalsight618,4,Sun Jun 28 14:30:53 2015 UTC,Alas that napkin list is in a café's bin. Although I am planning on posting some good sized comments on each fic's fimfic page in the near future.
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Arowid,4,Sun Jun 28 14:51:06 2015 UTC,"Good deal.  I know we'll all be looking forward to that.  One of the things I was most excited about when I heard Sisters had been nominated was hearing back from the pre-readers regarding their opinions on the story.  I'm always pushing myself to improve, and feedback can speed that process up by leaps and bounds.  Thanks again for the effort you put into all this."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,LoneWolfMark,4,Sun Jun 28 16:20:40 2015 UTC,"Hey now, don't you worry none! Your fic was a delight to read and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for some more Fo:Eq!"
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Arowid,6,Sun Jun 28 15:44:04 2015 UTC,I'm glad you liked it!  I'll try to keep this ball rolling as best I can!
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Hnetu,5,Sun Jun 28 16:22:37 2015 UTC,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I have a question.  Do we know when it'll be posted? Or should I keep checking EqD like an AHDH squirrel?
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Hnetu,4,Mon Jun 29 08:47:33 2015 UTC,"This being a new process and I couldn't at this time say, I don't know anything about how EQD's sytem is run. Hopefully I can get an answer for you. Until then, please stand by."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,LoneWolfMark,6,Mon Jun 29 13:23:34 2015 UTC,Ok. Thank you.
falloutequestria,3be6ny,finalsight618,4,Mon Jun 29 20:09:52 2015 UTC,Glad to hear this project was successful!  And thank you for not dissolving me in a vat of taint! Now I can continue on reading fics and catching up with Hnetu's latest chapter.
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Hnetu,5,Sun Jun 28 20:55:51 2015 UTC,"Awww, but i like Trixie and want to be an alicorn.  I believe all the other pre-readers will agree that all three stories are good and would recommend reading all of them.  Seeing as everyone else voted Infinite Potential last, I don't feel as bad. Borsuq if you are reading this, please continue writing this story. I did really like it.  The same goes for Arowind. Sisters is a great story and I eagerly await future chapters.  Congrats Hnetu, I hope you enjoy the influx of new readers that are sure to come your way.  Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to take a rest from reading for a week or so, to ease my eye strain."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,yetanotherpony,4,Sun Jun 28 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"I still feel like my 'win' only comes down to the fact that I've been around a lot longer and pushed out that update. It's hard to vote for a newer story (in my mind) that might be amazing, when someone else has been around for 2+ years. There'll be plenty of other votes to make sure others, including Sisters and Infinite Potential, get their time to shine."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Hnetu,3,Sun Jun 28 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"As one of the pre readers, not really! I didn't care how old or new it was, or how recent the last update was."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,finalsight618,3,Sun Jun 28 15:17:24 2015 UTC,WELL FINE THEN!  What pushed me into the winner's circle then?
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Hnetu,4,Sun Jun 28 15:27:51 2015 UTC,"Good characters with believable interactions. Good story flow. Great side characters (I love the steel ranger family). Some nice 'I so want to punch them' antagonists. Wirepony...  Also i really liked the chapter end 4th wall break convos. Normally i'm not a fan of 4th wall breaks in fics, but you did them well."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,Hnetu,3,Sun Jun 28 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"The post chapter banter is some out my favorite, because it'd very obviously not 'canon' which means I get to be silly writing it. Like allowing them to see their character sheets.  It's all very silly."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,finalsight618,3,Sun Jun 28 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Chock it up to quality writing, good sentence structure, good character progression, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The pre-readers selected based on what they perceived to be the best story. Because 'best story' is inherently subjective it means that they picked for different reasons.   One day one of the pre-readers is going to make their choice based solely on which fic had the most *ahem* physically attractive fanart. And while I hope no one ever does that, the law of infinite probability and all that state otherwise.  Edit: I just realized this makes me sound like an absolute asshole, fantastic.  Also:   winner's    NO WINNING!"
falloutequestria,3be6ny,sk2150ad,2,Sun Jun 28 16:08:24 2015 UTC,"No winning! Sorry.   A part of me is very selfish and glad I was the one chosen, but another feels bad that it had to be a choice. Regardless, thanks everyone."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,ReversedCarrot,2,Sun Jun 28 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"It's alright. It's just that if people start seeing this as a popularity contest, or game with winners and losers, I'm afraid people will start approaching it with a certain degree of aggression or accusatory doubt. The last thing I want to happen is this selection process to create further divides within the fandom."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,E-Squid,3,Sun Jun 28 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth"
falloutequestria,3be6ny,KrootLoops,4,Sun Jun 28 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for completing the selection process.  I will talk to my contacts and see if we can arrange getting it on the site asap.  I probably won't know exactly when because they have queues and such, but I should have it sent off by tonight."
falloutequestria,3be6ny,ReversedCarrot,3,Mon Jun 29 20:06:00 2015 UTC,Oh my goooodness!
falloutequestria,3be6ny,KrootLoops,3,Sun Jun 28 12:28:46 2015 UTC,I guess all I can say next time it won't be remotely as close
falloutequestria,3be6ny,ReversedCarrot,2,Mon Jun 29 01:04:16 2015 UTC,...Why?

falloutequestria,3bcd4w,Unknownlight,3,Sat Jun 27 21:46:47 2015 UTC,I believe i was around chapter 15 before i got tied up with other things. I intend to get back into it in the next couple of weeks.
falloutequestria,3bcdee,Scrap__Metal,3,Sat Jun 27 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The concept for stable 77 is neat, species specific tests are an interesting approach and get my mind running. Unicorn stable where magic is seen as akin to satanism? earth pony stable where nothing has mouth-grips? Oh the possibilities. The sparse coloration does a great job of drawing focus and enforcing the idea that the wasteland is, in fact, just that bleak. From your setup I'm kind of interested to see if the conspiracy theory in Stable 77 subplot makes a comeback.  The main protagonist's motivations are confusing to me, I feel like I skipped an internal monologue about where she's headed and why. She also seems oddly confident for having no goal or direction. The pacing in chapter one seems a but speedy for my taste, but what you have of chapter two so far seems far more fluid and balanced."
falloutequestria,3bcdee,2woToned,3,Sun Jun 28 10:35:12 2015 UTC,"A monologue on her plans might have been a good idea, yeah. Although it probably would have amounted to ""My plan consists of making things up as I go!""  As well, her confidence... she's a manipulator, she has a ton of confidence (whether real or faked). Where everyone else has guns, she has an aura of controlled presentation. Obviously, 'mindless' threats are one of her biggest weaknesses.  Still, she does lack goal and direction. That's actually planned to start coming into play after a few more pages. It's been taking long enough to get there, but every piece does have a place.  Regardless of my excuses, your input and criticisms are great to hear, and pretty accurate. Thanks! And I hope you enjoy the comic as it progresses."
falloutequestria,3baut9,mmllgg1337,6,Sat Jun 27 13:16:33 2015 UTC,Nothing really wrong with that. I'm sure there's more than one green slave pony in the wasteland.
falloutequestria,3baut9,ArgonGlow,3,Sat Jun 27 15:26:05 2015 UTC,The 'Simpsons did it!' effect is something that happen's from time to time. Unless it's a blatant rip-off there isn't to much to worry about.
falloutequestria,3baut9,finalsight618,3,Sun Jun 28 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you how many times I've had an idea only to find out that someone else did something super similar already.  Don't worry, it happens.  That's just life."
falloutequestria,3baut9,iIsMe95,2,Sun Jun 28 22:27:34 2015 UTC,thanks i know but its so similar i just rememberd i have a deviant art post to show just how similar http://coolin79.deviantart.com/art/Clipped-Horn-470733924
falloutequestria,3baut9,Moonblaze13,2,Mon Jun 29 23:03:51 2015 UTC,There is nothing new under the sun. Including this sentence.

falloutequestria,3b901c,OvermareStudios,5,Fri Jun 26 23:14:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some of those concepts look a bit eh...  But that fucking dragon-heart rifle, though!"
falloutequestria,3b901c,E-Squid,3,Sat Jun 27 01:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see why they didn't add the rifle though, it requires a dragon to power a single rifle, there's no way that's cost effective and they couldn't get a large number of them, a weapon like that wouldn't make it past the experimental phase, no matter how effective it is."
falloutequestria,3b901c,Devouring_One,6,Sat Jun 27 02:09:21 2015 UTC,"Certainly. It strikes me as a fun unique weapon to find, though.  Though on that note, it really sounds more like a zebra weapon to me, experimental or not. Maybe they could manage to make it economical with their ~*weird zebra magicks*~ or something, like giving the donor dragons cybernetic/alchemical/talisman powered hearts."
falloutequestria,3b901c,E-Squid,3,Sat Jun 27 02:39:55 2015 UTC,Something something mods.
falloutequestria,3b901c,RenagadeGam3r,3,Sat Jun 27 10:32:29 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Overmare has approached the project with mods in mind. But, if they release the source upon completion then anyone with knowledge of Unity can create and release oodles upon oodles of custom content, redesigned mechanics, even a whole new FOE game."
falloutequestria,3b901c,2woToned,2,Sat Jun 27 14:22:27 2015 UTC,"Project Horizons mod? Well that would be some massive modding, the story is so much longer and it's super complicate IDK anyone could make this tru. But some minor companion mod would be nice."
falloutequestria,3b901c,Fadlanu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know, it would be... less than ideal. I mean, how do you possibly convey chapter 33 without it feeling like a farce?  It'd probably just be a new story just using the game as a medium, which I am totally on board with. Come to think of it I actually really want them to release the source when they're finished now, oh the delicious possibilities."
falloutequestria,3b901c,2woToned,2,Fri Jul 3 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"chapter 33    Well, for those who didin't read story that part would be super confusing.  There are though much more confusing parts in that story, like Discord part, Rampage story, Moon traveling, body changing and such, make it to look just good would be Sisyphean labours."
falloutequestria,3b901c,Fadlanu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:54:02 2015 UTC,"It's like a dragon and rifle, combined!!! Maybe some terminal entrances only?"
falloutequestria,3b901c,Fadlanu,4,Fri Jul 3 15:54:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, TOmS has a quest contest? I didn't know! I just spent the last 6 hours writing out my quest. I have been stockpiling all my Fallout projects in preparation for FO4, so why not ponify one and give it a test run beforehand? Pretty fun."
falloutequestria,3b901c,ElementOfConfusion,3,Sun Jun 28 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Can you tell something more, or is it top secret?"
falloutequestria,3b901c,Fadlanu,2,Fri Jul 3 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'll tell you a rough story line. But first I must say, I designed the quest to not just be a simple follow-the-marker-kill-the-dude quest like most bounties. It is generally very marker light, and the player won't be held by the hand. You will have to think like you were really tracking someone, use common sense, detective skills and observation to learn where your bounties are, and learn more about each target. I designed the quest to use the 4 basic play styles (combat, stealth, science, charisma) so each will be quite useful and fun. There are many ways to approach the targets, all of them satisfying. There are also multiply ways to start and end the quest... but there will be interesting and very different consequences and rewards.  So, basic story outline;  Mega quest arc begins: Littlepip comes across a small fortified slum very near Tenpony Tower, where a former Tenpony security guard, called Security Leak, lives and protects the local beggars. She learns a raid occurred recently, and goes to investigate. It was a highly unusual raid, and Littlepip quickly deduces that a part was stolen from one of the wreaked vehicles that are located within the slum. Talking to Security Leak, he is very rude and sarcastic, and incredibly unhelpful.  At this point, Littlepip puts on a detective hat and (assuming she has the skills) starts asking around, looking at bodies, bullet casings, explosive damage, looking at terminals etc. Ever if Littlepip has 0 skill in everything, the minimum she gets is the rough location or direction of each target, and that there were 3.  3 quests begin, 1 for each target.  The targets are in fact a team of professional heistors with a long history, each member with a unique skill they bring to the table. As you follow each target (they split up), you learn more about them, their bounty (if you haven't already) and the job they were doing that required the vehicle part. I'm not going to spoil each target, but each was made to be different, interesting and have personality. Each playstyle is useful for each target, but 1 of each target was tailor made for a certain skill. One is a basic combat boss, one is a hidden spy in a town that Littlepip must root out, and another... is the explosives expert with a fondness of experimentation and dramatics.  After each target is dead, there are 6 ways to end the quest, depending on what the player discovered and said. The outcomes will involve Security Leak (who has a larger part then I mention here), Tenpony Tower and possibly Friendship City."
falloutequestria,3b901c,ElementOfConfusion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome, hope you win the contest, that quest really would be fun to play."
falloutequestria,3b5k85,Manamanky,3,Fri Jun 26 03:45:12 2015 UTC,Interesting premise... I'll be giving this one a read!
falloutequestria,3b5k85,KaiserVonIkapoc,3,Fri Jun 26 05:43:36 2015 UTC,"Well, just finished chapter two. Wow, the world building is amazing. I can't be sure whether I love or fear what (I assume) you've created. I get the feeling that something regarding an overarching plot will start soon? Either way I am very excited to read more.  As for critiques, there are quite a few typos and the like. Finding an editor or just general word checker would be a good idea."
falloutequestria,3b5k85,2woToned,3,Fri Jun 26 06:01:11 2015 UTC,A great cover art from mangticore
falloutequestria,3b5k85,ReversedCarrot,2,Fri Jun 26 10:45:24 2015 UTC,"Yes fantastic cover by him, I asked him to hold off uploading until after the story was released, he should be uploading it some time tonight or tomorrow."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,SomberPony,19,Thu Jun 25 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"You think this community is dying?  Fallout 4 has been announced so I'm sure plenty of writers will write new stories based on the new source material, not to mention Fo4 will create a new wave of fans."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,GearBent,5,Thu Jun 25 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"For me it isn't that it is dying, but rather that it could start very easily. Some of my personal fears are a mix of splintering from drama and taking sides, and from stagnation from nobody new coming into the fandom. As people leave from drama or no longer feeling as passionately about it, and with no one new coming in, the numbers will dwindle and eventually die."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,2woToned,5,Thu Jun 25 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, kinda outta the loop. What's the drama everyone seems to be referring to?"
falloutequestria,3b34sq,trabecula,3,Thu Jun 25 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"Late replay, whatever...  This argument happened here a few months ago. It's a lot of long comments...  Approximate (and incomplete) TLDR: People complain about Project Horizons choking out other fics with its size and popularity. Somber (author of PH) joins the conversation and handed the situation rather poorly. More upset folks and angry comments follows."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,PianoCube93,3,Mon Jun 29 18:06:15 2015 UTC,And now I'm trying to do better.
falloutequestria,3b34sq,the4thaggie,3,Tue Jun 30 02:41:08 2015 UTC,"Everything with a beginning has an end.  We can cheat many things, but we can't cheat Death for very long.  The problem is that the brony fandom is getting stale fandom-wide.  Most bronies were either highschool or college-aged when the fandom kicked off.  Now, many are in a different life.  This happened to me with anime.  When I became an educated and productive member of society after graduating college, I found that my interest dwindled greatly."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,Devouring_One,4,Thu Jun 25 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"We aren't going away that easily, and I'm sure this part of the fandom can cheat death for at least a few years after the show ends, as it has other source material to play with, and a decent amount of originality thrown into the mix"
falloutequestria,3b34sq,2woToned,3,Thu Jun 25 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"Do not go gentle into that good night,   Old age should burn and rave at close of day,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  There is no reason we cannot live on, the contributions by the EBC, Gardens of Equestria Project, Overmare, and many others could drive us forward for quite some time. But they need our help and support to see that future fulfilled."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,LoneWolfMark,3,Thu Jun 25 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"While this is true, people will always be fearful of their groups becoming less popular and whatnot. But I'm of the same mindset as you. Fallout is an enormous franchise with thousands of dedicated fans, and Fallout 4 will only expand that audience (But whether or not these new people decide to check out the Equestrian side of things... That's the key to our continuing growth At least, that's what I feel)."

falloutequestria,3b34sq,the4thaggie,8,Thu Jul 2 06:16:26 2015 UTC,"I want to belieb believe!  Something I would add to this is something I see needs improvement if the intended goal is to provide constructive feedback:   Keep it simple or at least try not to add unnecessary fluff.  Lets face it.  The majority of the people who do try to give feedback write text walls.  This feedback could be optimized, but it often isn't.  Why is this important?  Because:   The audience has limited time and attention spans Your central point is playing ""Crouching point, Hidden message"" amongst all the fluff. The tone could be misconstrued by you or them Efficient communication shows intelligence, credibility, and care. Writing at an 8th grade level is preferred even within a university business setting.   With any bit of commentary, it is important to remember why and to whom you are writing it.  If your intention is to deliver timely and digestible feedback to an author, then keep it simple, stupid.  If your goal is to appeal to pseudo-academics, keep writing walls of text.   Besides, it's much more challenging and rewarding to write executive summaries than it is to write a multi-page report with the same information.  Trust me."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,LoneWolfMark,7,Thu Jun 25 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"After reading this, my response feels very long winded and pointless..."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,LoneWolfMark,6,Thu Jun 25 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"Personally, i feel like we're already heading in a good direction to renew our numbers and keep current fans of Fallout: Equestria interested. Creaters such as yourself are really the key to keeping this all going, and works from the likes of the Overmare Studios pull in a lot of fans.  Speaking of Overmare, their upcoming game interpretation of the main fic will be one of many shiny baubles that will attract fans, new and old. I can quite personally atest to their part in keeping people interested - the music of the 'Wasteland Wailers' is fantastic.  As for the community side of things, I feel this subreddit does a good job of pushing new and continuing sidefics into the fanbase's attention - I recently read Sisters, Treasure Hunting, and Infinite Potential as part of the pre-reading team and I can say wholeheartedly that I look forward to following these stories as they progress further. And with the efforts /u/2woToned has made to coordinate this pre-reader effort, we should be able to pull in more fans from EQD.  In terms of actually commenting on works consistently, well... that's actually something I;m guilty of not doing. When I see art pop up in the subreddit, I upvote it, favourite the ones I really like on DA or Tumblr or wahtever and leave it at that. Same goes with the sidefics I've read, I've never left any direct criticism or praise really (excluding the occasional piece of art here and there) so I know that's something I need to work on, as a fan.  But that's just it, isn't it? Content like all this takes hours, days, or weeks to produce and only seconds, minutes, or hours to absorb - the average fan wont really participate nearly as much as the dedicated or the hateful, and that's always the case - though I'm beginning to hope it wont be for much longer (I really am becoming attached to this particular subfandom).  TL;DR - I feel like we'll be fine. But apathy always speaks loudest."

I'm a pessimist, so I always worry that things are going to fail and like to take proactive steps so that things will be as strong and as vibrant as they'll possibly be.  Part of this, I admit, was because an author was lamenting her lack of feedback, and I've been there.  You wonder if there's anyone to even write for.  Why are you bothering?  Does this even matter.  So this was in part a response to that."

falloutequestria,3b34sq,SevenCell,6,Mon Jun 29 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm new. I don't usually join things, but I wanted to post this comment. I don't think there's anything truly insightful in here. I'm pretty much just saying the same thing in different words.  This kind of fandom participation stuff is neatly described with some game theory concepts. I'm no game theory expert; I just thought I'd bring this up because it's such a great way to think about the problem (and because I get excited over stupid math stuff).  You have any number of players. Each has 2 strategies: participate or don't. The more people who participate, the higher the payoff for participants, and vice versa: fewer participants, lower payoff. If very few players participate, the payoff for participation is negative. Choosing not to participate has no payoff either way.  It's a gamble of trust. There's always the safe option: don't participate. You lose nothing, but gain nothing. You can choose to participate, but if you're one of very few people who do, you lose something: time and effort. You hope that a lot of people will participate, which leads to gains.  That's basically my thought process as a lurker around the edges of the Fo:E fandom. I sorta want to write a side story, but it's been so long since the original, it APPEARS that the fandom is losing steam, and it's hard to convince myself that the effort would be rewarded.  I'll bet there are a lot of others like me who WANT to join but are AFRAID that they've already missed out on things. The trouble is that the problem — lower activity — seems to defeat its own solution.  I've been thinking about this a lot, trying to come up with a good solution (or determine whether or not one might exist), and I have a bunch of ideas but no solid conclusions or plans.  At the very least, I have started to comment more. That's why this happened. Aren't you glad?"
falloutequestria,3b34sq,xDarastrix,2,Thu Jun 25 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"First off, it's great to see new blood. I highly recommend getting more involved, the people here are great.  Second, the biggest mistake I see people making is thinking that stories and art are the only ways to contribute - they're not. If you really want to write a story, more power to you, but if you're good at something else, do that instead. I'm teaching myself art, music and a load of other things, but I'm primarily an engineer - I spend time designing FoE machines as though it were its own distinct scifi universe, with its own distinct principles. Maybe you're better at programming, or organisation - in that case, speak to the Overmare game studio or Stable Tec to see if you can help them. (Maybe not Stable Tec, come to think of it)  There are parts of this fandom who are in for the LONG haul. Even if it falls dormant by that point, I guarantee they'll rekindle interest very easily when their projects manifest."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,Moonblaze13,7,Sat Jun 27 09:20:15 2015 UTC,"Hey Somber.  I don't post much, I'm a big lurker... And you're right.  I love your work (and other writers) so much so that Blackjack has become my favorite cosplay, but I never comment.   So I'm definitely going to start, even if it's 2 weeks late and just a ""good job."".  I feel like a community leech now, at least on /r/foe.    Good job Somber."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,sk2150ad,4,Fri Jun 26 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"Love this, but I do have one dissenting opinion:  A simple ""good job"" is the worst piece of feedback I recieve. I so often just get ""It's good"" or ""I like it"" when showing people my work, and when they can't tell me what they liked... well, it feels like they didn't put any real thought into it. I'm writing because I want to engage readers, make them think intensely and feel intensely. If you tell me you like it but can't identify why, that's a failure to me.  So please, please, please. If you're going to tell someone you liked something, take the extra second to identify something specific you liked. It'll be five seconds extra effort on your part, but it'll mean the world to them."

falloutequestria,3b34sq,Devouring_One,3,Fri Jun 26 10:50:39 2015 UTC,"I lurk here but I'm still not completely sure what FO:E is exactly. My best guess is, not exactly a world-building group like Orion's Arm, but more of a very lose premises, like, ""Post Apocalyptic Ponies"" and everyone draws art and writes stories against that backdrop, but without a cohesive shared campaign setting or cannon to adhere to. But I could be wrong, and there's a single shared world and timeline and everyone collectively contributes to it. I also for a while thought it was an RP group."
falloutequestria,3b34sq,Devouring_One,5,Fri Jun 26 05:23:48 2015 UTC,"I think I can clear that up, FO:E is this story http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html but many people are inspired by this story and make their own set within the same relative setting, or similarly make images or PnP campaigns or the like, so while there is a canon of some sort, it's not really something you have to closely follow if you so choose to or not to."

We'll report and delete the comments that must be, accept the legit feedback and thank those who praise it.

falloutequestria,3b45i7,2woToned,2,Sun Jun 28 23:22:41 2015 UTC,"It's not going to stop us.   Excellent, it's very important that you should never bend to the will of those who would hate you regardless. I feel like I've done entire write-ups on brony haters and my stance still hasn't changed. Don't engage or try to discuss it with them, just report and move on. If it gets bad enough maybe we can contact Nexus about setting up an additional content filter for pony material (it's currently supposed to be under 'anime') and refer all who neigh-say to that.  Regardless, I played what I assume to be the whole of Smuggler's Run and thoroughly enjoyed it. The attention to detail was perfect, just enough without too much. It seems to be easy to go completely overboard and smack pony stickers on every object and surface. The only objects I personally thought were a bit loud in design were Dash's equipment. I know brashness is key to the character that is Rainbow Dash, I just personally prefer subtle designs."

falloutequestria,3axhur,Amorack,3,Fri Jun 26 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"I find the whole stigma (if you can call it that) towards sex in pony fanfiction to be somewhat odd. As in, that there's such a need to separate them or avoid sex at all costs while a fade-to-black is still acceptable.   When in 6th grade I stumbled upon The Mammoth Hunters in the school library and picked it up, which later led to a nice surprise with a scene including all kinds of things ranging from masturbation to oral sex. Since then I've always just assumed that in book-form you can write whatever you want without a need to warn people about it because hey, it's just words. It's only in this fandom that people seem awfully restricted from my limited experience. Which makes sense as far as MLP goes I guess, but Fallout Equestria already establishes that they have sex just as much as we do plus plenty of gore and rape, so I just found it weird that Kkat felt the need to have a fade-to-black scene when she could very well have gone all-out with it.   I don't read much books though, so I might have gotten my view of it all pulled upside down by Jean Auel."
falloutequestria,3axhur,Jet7Wave,2,Fri Jun 26 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to say anything about my opinion except it seems to usually be the unpopular one (probably just gave it all away) but honestly, the story is just so good that looking past it is not a problem."
falloutequestria,3axhur,SkylightShepherd,4,Thu Jun 25 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"With me it's similar to you, except for its not the fact that a character is gay or not, it's that I don't really need to hear about a character's sex life period, but again, the story is worth it to look past that"
falloutequestria,3axhur,Devouring_One,10,Thu Jun 25 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"Littlepip has a fondness for female posteriors that extends beyond that of her own race. Also the swearing, if you read it the swearing definitely gives it away."

I am a bit introverted in nature, so it was nothing I really acted on until I realized I had a serious crush on Velvet.  I find it interesting that the human who voices me in the radioplay actually came out of the closet too.  People didn't mind her reveal at all, and most people don't mind that I'm written to be a lesbian horse.  Hell... It's what makes me endearing apparently.  Aside from my adorkable nature and colorful swears, ofcourse. But hey, in the Wasteland you are lucky to find love at all.  I'll take what I get, but I am grateful for what I did."
falloutequestria,3axhur,LittlePip,4,Thu Jun 25 13:41:33 2015 UTC,It's pretty much her defining character trait and the catalyst for the entire story.

Spoilers below  As a general comment, wow, a lot happened in this one! First though, speaking of things to gush over:   Fine Tune as a terrifying ""insect attack beast."" Lost Art lecturing a giant, violently unstable, alicorn, even including grabbing her by an ear. Loved it. “Stop standing on me.” Adorable moments between the best wasteland sisters, as always. That last scene. That last line.   It definitely felt like the capstone to the arc that's been going for a while, and there was a lot of good   characterization and tying together plotlines to go with that. Lost Art finally addressing her relationship with Crème Brûlée, Hidden explaining her brainwashing to Rose, Rose trying to be Kind and keep her temper in check. Lamington also seemed to get a lot more personality than he has so far, which was nice to see. And the direction they were heading seemed like a natural next step for the story, with the different motivations tying together organically. Until Slipstock shows up, of course. I really can't wait for the next chapter to see what comes of that development.  Finally, there were a few minor typos. Unfortunately I forgot to write some of them down, but at least saw one still in there.    ...repairing mechanical malfunctions in nowhere near as practiced as my sister’s.”"

This chapter was kind of a busy one simply because I was trying to finish off all the stuff in the story arc to open things up for the next one. Only one real thread needs to keep going (and that will hopefully get resolved in the next two chapters). Lamington's personalization is simply because he's finally getting more screen time. It's really hard to characterize the 'by the books' guy when he only pops in for a few lines at a time. As for the interruption of that organic motivation, I've been waiting for that forever.

Have you SEEN the PH threads, which end up with 50-100 comments just by themselves?  I just... I'm starved for feedback, it feels like no one's reading. And it's starting to have a serious affect on my writing; Look at how rarely I update now. 99% of it is because of depression caused my a very serious why even bother mentality. I get no feedback, no comments, nothing...  Sorry for begging."
falloutequestria,3at45r,SomberPony,3,Thu Jun 25 13:15:38 2015 UTC,"No, it's a valid concern. I'm trying my best to get people to start engaging, but you know the old adage: You can lead a fandom to content, but you can't make them comment on it... or something like that.  And while the PH threads get pretty chatty, a majority of posted content gets nothing but silence. The update to Longtalons, an update to the ""Ask the Slaves"" blog, and that little start-up SunFall have less comments combined than your chapter on FimFic.

It's hard, because ultimately you feel like what you're doing is worthless, so why not quit and cut your losses?  So I definitely sympathize.

There's some grammatical tics throughout the chapter with commas that don't need to be there, and the ""Us-,"" confuses me. The defeat at the end seems to come completely out of no where, and it was about there that I stopped.

falloutequestria,3aptrl,HomageFoE,4,Mon Jun 22 16:48:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely not what you asked for, but just in case you also look to play New Vegas and/or someone else is looking for some, here's ones that I have found:  (roughly from most recommended to least recommended)  Most of these will do nothing if installed in FO3 (not NV) but many will have some parts of them work in FO3, and shouldn't cause any issues, so go ahead and give them a try!   My Little Pony texture replacement  (really good signs and medkit textures.  I install this last, because There are other mods that change the same posters, but I like this one's best.) My Little Anthro Pony  (If anthro freaks you out-stay away.  If you like it, this mod is great.  Personally, I'm indifferent, but this lets you play as an anthro pony, as well as having such followers.)   [Additionally, I have discovered you do NOT require an ENB to use this mod if you only have one pony follower, and use the 4GB patch.] Fallout Equestria Main Menu  Very nice menu screen.  good music too.) Couriers Radio Station  (I use this to make a custom radio station with FoE-themed music.  Ask me if your interested in some of the music I've found for this.) My Little Pones- Textures is Magic (Mediocre texture mod.  Adds some nice textures though, I just make sure I overwrite the other one on top of this one.) My Little Pony Shirts (Mediocre, but it's there.)   Alright, now for the one vanilla Fo3 Mod I know I can recommend:   My Little Pony Texture Pack Plus  (Does bottlecaps, cola, etc.  Pretty good overall.)   Finally, a list of non-MLP mods that are must-haves:   Populated Casinos  A must 4GB Fallout New Vegas  A must with texture mods New Vegas Stutter Remover  Very helpful in some weird situations EVE - Essential Visual Enhancements  A must if your a fan of energy weapons. NMCs_Texture_Pack_For_New_Vegas  My favorite texture pack.  Giant textures, look pretty nice. HI-RES Chems and Health Re-Texture  Makes stimpacks and drugs look beautiful.   If you guys have any other suggestions that are very well-made mods that do more than just add a single weapon or somesuch, PLEASE do tell me!  I'm playing through the game right now, and am always looking for additions!   []()"

falloutequestria,3akjuc,Harakou,6,Sun Jun 21 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"It actually is. I will try and find the quote.  Chapter 65.   The word was typed in, and suddenly the air filled with the dazzling magical patterns once more.  “I knew you could do it,” Cognitum purred.  “It’s your special talent.”  “My what?” I asked with a frown.  “Victory.  Your talent is winning,” Cognitum said as she looked at my flanks almost hungrily.  “Poor Deus.  Sanguine.  Even you, Steel Rain.  You were facing a mare whose very talent is overcoming adversity, no matter its form.”  “My talent is victory?  Do you have any idea how many times I’ve been shot up?  How many times I’ve died?” I demanded, then blinked.  “I mean, sure, I got better, but I haven’t had it remotely easy.”  “Victory isn’t easy.  It has a cost.  Always.  But you are always able to pay that cost.  Perhaps you don’t like it.  Perhaps you even hate it.  But victory is branded on your flanks for all to see.  A winning pair, impossible to beat in the game of Blackjack.”  She smiled as if she’d just hit the jackpot herself.  “But the ghoul in Hightower, and when Lighthooves was trying to blast us with the Core’s defenses... I didn’t win then!” I argued.  “Didn’t you?  You used what you had to defeat your enemies.  And what you had was my attention.  You even made me act when I had determined not to.”  She reached out with a hoof and stroked my cheek, making me take a step back.  “So you’re saying there’s some way for me to beat you?” I said, eagerly, expecting to set her back, or at least make her frown.  Instead, she seemed even more eager.  “Oh, yes.  I’m certain of it.  And I’m certain that if you had the time, you’d find some way to do so,” Cognitum replied evenly.  “I suspected that this was your talent the very second I first met you as Applebot.  Victory.  Winning.  Such a potent weapon, and you had no idea you possessed it.”"

Please stop associating healthy cynicism and criticism of writing skill and direction as ""negativity"" because this community is overblown with forums where criticism is banned and everybody has to be nicey nice and friendly because the admins are too scared of just accepting when people act like people.  I get that you're running a forum here and trying to keep it from vitriol but nobody in this thread has insulted Somber personally at all, it's all healthy and acceptable pokes at his story which regardless your opinion on Somber, it really deserves it some times."
falloutequestria,3akjuc,Manamanky,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:31:29 2015 UTC,"Except, it's far too often the case that it dissolves into two monkeys flinging shit at each other.  No matter if it's encased in a velvet-lined encyclopedia or out in the open for all to see, it still reeks.      That is what I want to avoid, and that is what I saw that kind of thread turning into.  I can't assume anything more than I have already seen.  TBH, I saw it as a gateway for Somber or others to turn this subreddit into a battleground again.  Somber wasn't looking for criticism that would go towards improving his epic.  Clearly, any and all criticism would be wasted on a fic that is on the pinnacle of closure.  It was, as I gathered, a way for all the people that feel like they have something to get off their chest about him or PH.  I don't see the value.  If the criticism would be constructive to the fic in the long-term, maybe, but at this point it's just wasted air.  All I see is people raising torches and pitchforks for a fic already on it's deathbed (by which I mean it's soon-end)."
falloutequestria,3akjuc,the4thaggie,2,Mon Jun 22 06:02:48 2015 UTC,"But there is of course legitimate qualms about PH that deserve attention, not to bring up that argument again but PH did get a LOT of unwarrented attention, and given the shitty rules on the IRC there was often just an echo-chamber and feedback loop of people telling Somber how great PH which subsequently was all people saw when they entered.  The reason why PH gets so much flak is more to do with how long the story went with nothing but inordinate praise and how taboo it was to say you didn't like it.  I don't know if I'm making sense or pitching this in a way that is helpful but the point is, you need to see a lot of the cricism of PH is warranted and deserves to be voiced, I say again, the people who hate PH typically don't hate Somber, they just hate the writing, and that is okay and should be allowed.  You should allow the criticism and flak to every fic, not just PH to flow freely because its a virtue to smile and laugh at yourself as well as healthy to see your own flaws and negativity presented to you.  However I'm not saying you should just allow abuse, abuse should be met with a harsh line in the sand, however you need to really focus on making this Subreddit somewhere discussion is free and open and not just a nicey nice hugbox where everybody has to be friendly and no discussion that could hurt feelings is allowed.  An author/artist by all means should be expected to be okay with people hating their work, thats just how the real world works."
falloutequestria,3akjuc,Manamanky,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:28:24 2015 UTC,"Give it 6-12 months and I'm sure PH will no longer the the only star in the sky, now that the EQD spotlight is here other deserving fics can get exposure and will thrive and we wont have any reason to even think of PH anymore. It will cease to be in its esteemed and exclusive position as new and fresh fics join it.  As long as everyone has a chance to 'make it' based on skill and merit then all is fair and there is nothing to complain about.  If we didn't have the spotlight though, it would be a much different story, one of unfairness, monopolies and bubbling, accumulating anger and resentment....

falloutequestria,3ahw30,Jay911,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:03:47 2015 UTC,Probably Super Ponio Brothers or MegaMare.
falloutequestria,3ahw30,2woToned,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:09:50 2015 UTC,It looks like it's based on the 8-bit Adventure Ponies game that used to be on The Hub's game portal.
falloutequestria,3ahiwr,cptadder,4,Sat Jun 20 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"The problem might not be with the system.  If your players want to shoot their way through every obstacle, the problem is with them.  Non-creative players just aren't fun.  So just give them obstacles they can't shoot their way through.  Say for instance, they need to recover some item from a bunker.  Problem is, the bunker is full of radiation, parts of it have collapsed and their are a lot of doors and terminals between them and their prize.  Tension and atmosphere abound.  Or maybe give them a problem that will only get worse by fighting through it.  Say that they need to negotiate between two rival factions that are teetering close to war.  If they attack one openly, their people scatter and start using guerrilla and terrorist tactics.  Water sources are poisoned, terror bombs are set, and the people they choose to side with start hating them for causing this.  You are the GM, you are god!  Use your powers and make 'em get creative."
falloutequestria,3ahiwr,iIsMe95,2,Sat Jun 20 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"At least 15. Personally I like Savage Worlds, so I used a modification specifically for Fo:E. (made by /u/DoctorBoson)    You're using quite a crunchy system and your players seem to be out-crunching you. If you want a more deadly experience I'd reccommended you switch systems."
falloutequestria,3ahiwr,ellenok,2,Sat Jun 20 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, the FOE conversion is going to be going into its second edition as I finalize my vanilla Fallout conversion (in celebration of FO4). FOE will follow soon afterwards with updated stats, some new mechanics, more beasties, and finalizing my weapons."
falloutequestria,3ahiwr,DoctorBoson,2,Sat Jun 20 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"If doing this online and needing players, I have a lot of character concepts I want to try out for FOE!  I do agree with /u/iIsMe95 that it's probably more to your players' faults than the system's. I mean, Pathfinder technically has no skill cap(yeah, you're limited to your level in the amount of ranks you can put into a single skill) but the miscellaneous bonuses are nearly infinite and most stack with each other so you can have a character that has a +15 in a skill at first level. Heck, in one of the games I play in, there's a Brawler that has a +23 to Grapple checks. and we're level 7. Yeah, there's going to be powergamers and minmaxers and all that other stuff, but you can't blame the system for that.  Edit: I also found a Google Doc with the rules and a few Google Sheets I had laying around for a different Fo:E game. Link: Here you go"
falloutequestria,3ahiwr,Entinu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"I've actually been running a game using the FoE RPG system (the complicated one.) The tedious math is mostly done during character creation, and we all found the system reasonably easy to pick up after a combat or two. I prefer the step-based d% rolls over the usual 1d20+ridiculous modifiers. GM determines what step it takes to hit, and the player rolls to see what step they get. The skills are capped, and things like cover function more as expected.  Might not hurt to at least give it a try, to see if you and your players like it."
falloutequestria,3ahiwr,ArgonGlow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:04:20 2015 UTC,"the first session I ran as a FOE:Campaign (FOE:PNP Revised)   Yeah, that's... a problem. I've never used it (not for more than like, one session anyway), but the group I play with tried using it and found it so broken that they had to embark on their own project to fix it up and get something playable out of it. Our version is a bit less crunchy and less bloated, but unfortunately, not centralized like the stock rule book. If you're looking for something that's still kind of familiar but (ideally) more usable and not retarded, this might be worth a shot."

falloutequestria,3ag6qx,ArgonGlow,10,Fri Jun 19 23:01:28 2015 UTC,"...What? What is this blood feud? Something between this sub and the IRC in the sidebar? Everytime one of these drama-explosions happen, I'm just left wondering what's going on. This is the first time I've heard of the situation."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,Hnetu,16,Sat Jun 20 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: This is my view of what happened and is only as accurate as I can make it as a person. If there are inaccuracies, I apologize, but this is as authentic as I can get without being letting my emotions get into things.  It's less a blood fued and more a mishmash of separate things that created the perfect storm. Given my bias in it, I'll attempt to explain without letting my person opinions get into things.  There is an IRC channel specifically setup for discussion of Fallout Equestria within the greater Equestria Daily network of channels. Nomad is the creator/head moderator of the channel there.  Separately, this subreddit exists, run by the benevoletish Aggie (I kid, I kid.). The two communities were tied, but essentially separate due to being on different sites, different types of interactions allowed on them (a chat vs a topic board)  Now, the IRC channel is considered by many to be somewhat insular. Specific opinions are not-quite enforced through various means, mostly that the mods have their opinions of things and they have a very 'my way or the highway' sort of approach to moderation; specifically in that any discussion of a specific story that's not a glowing review is considered 'fic bashing' or 'author bashing' rather than even something as innocent as differing opinions or even criticism. Now this has caused many, myself included, who feel slighted by that sort of heavyhanded moderation to leave.  It's very hard to have a happy community when the only happiness comes from censorship. Full disclosure, last year in Febuary (2014 Febuary) I myself had a spat there because Project Horizons had done something I was planning on doing and I felt quite upset because... Well, to repeat my complaint, PH does everything. It's effectively the Simpsons of the fandom; if an idea exists, PH has done it. (This is my opinion on the matter and you are free to disagree. I am merely explaining my position for clarification and background, as well as disclosure of my past both there and here.) So, after that fight (and a whisper by a third party who claimed all I did was cause fights) I left.   That wasn't an isolated event, either. Any time someone came into the channel with grievances against the favored fic, it would result in problems; because again, even constructive criticism or critique was answered with ""NO FIC BASHING!"" even when complaints or discussion was entirely within the realm of reasonable discussion between members.  Again, I'm biased on this and being forward about it. PH's 'no fic bashing' wasn't the only one, but it was easily the most frequent due to the size and well... See a few months back when we had a fight here... Which leads me to...  A month or two ago there was a thread posted asking if Murky Number 7 was finished/cancelled due to the long break between chapters when Fuzzy got himself a job. Responses were given, but one person said something about the larger fics finishing soon which would leave room for newer and smaller ones to have their time in the sun.  AND... All Hell broke loose. I had initially tried to discuss it the same manner one would dissect an animal in science class. PH got popular for a lot of reasons, not all of them bad. It had an amazing start, is well written in a technical sense (grammar/sentence structure; not plot), got started at JUST right right time, had help from its own EqD post, etc.... But then Somber responded, and well... Vitriol and hate started to flow. I'm the first to admit that I started to make the posts into personal attacks. It was wrong of me. But here's where something interesting happened; given that we were allowed to vent our frustration and a lot of people got involved to talk about it... On both sides of the fence, we got a chance to make something of the stagnant and extremely fractured community. Hence the recent stickies about EqD posts/voting.  Now after this wave of drama, and it was drama, Aggie stepped up and said that he felt (and I'm paraphrasing here) that he'd let things get too far, and brought on Nomad in an effort to bridge the cap between communities. As Nomad was the creator/admin of the IRC channel, it was decided that he would be a good fit to... ... try and sew some unity.   A few people opposed, myself included. Nomad then offered an apology, but as visible in the post below... He basically took the politician approach and made a non-apology. There is a big difference between ""I'm sorry I offended you."" and ""I'm sorry you were offended."" It's the same as the difference between ""I'm sorry I shot you."" and ""I'm sorry you're a pussy, it's just a little bullet.""  When he was approached to discuss this, his less-than-humbling qualities and how he was putting the others as those in the wrong... He refused to budge and generally acted infallable and that everyone else was shit so why should he bother trying to make things better between himself and those who felt slighted? The conversation was copied, and then he went to the IRC channel and asked to have the post downvote bombed. Downvote bombing is against reddit's official ruleset, which is what led us to the removal of him as a moderator."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,sk2150ad,8,Sat Jun 20 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"...Huh. Bias or no, thanks for the explanation. I guess that explains (at least partly) the recent anti-PH explosion. I do have to wonder though, why is there a need to ""bridge the gap"" between out communities? It's not like either has a monopoly on FoE-related discussion. If people like the IRC, or this sub, or both, they can hang out where they like. Everyone just needs to remember that each place has its own rules and expectations.  (Btw, what idea did PH steal from you? Just curious)"
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,Hnetu,6,Sat Jun 20 06:40:40 2015 UTC,"Mostly because we have a very fractured community. There's people here, there's people on the IRC, there's people on 4chan, but we're all insular little groups rather than one BIG group. And we shouldn't have a fractured community like that. Drawing everyone together, as an idea, would be better for the group."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,Hnetu,2,Sat Jun 20 12:33:59 2015 UTC,She cant say without spoiling!
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,IrrelevantEraserhead,3,Sat Jun 20 06:45:38 2015 UTC,"I'm quite capable of giving my own answers.  Edit: I think the term 'steal' is a bit strong. That's how I felt at the time. The idea was something I'd had planned for the future and PH also used it in a slightly different way. At the time it felt like a slight, because we'd actively discussed it. MUCH later, once I'd cooled off, I went back and researched and noticed context and foreshadowing. It was just a part of that 'perfect storm' moment."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,4fffs,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"The ""Blood Feud"" comparison was not commentary on the sub vs the IRC.  It's commentary on this specific fight that's been going on between you and ppl vs. Nomad and IRC (kinda) for what seems a significant amount of time in this fandom.    As far as I am concerned, it's your scuffle/grudge with Nomad and his past.  The only part this subreddit has played is the battleground, and that was never MY intention of this ever being."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,SomberPony,4,Sat Jun 20 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"No, no. I understand. I was merely trying to give context on why it came up. When censorship happens in one place, people will turn to another where they can scream and shout and be childish. (And I'm talking about myself here.)   I apologize for not clarifying that it wasn't Subreddit vs IRC and instead was 'some people vs Nomad's culture' that simply ended up with the subreddit as a battlefield."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,Moonblaze13,6,Sat Jun 20 20:24:54 2015 UTC,"For clarity's sake, I don't really care about the whole PH/ficshaming debacle, or perhaps only tangentially. The alarms only started going off in my head when, so to speak, the battle was brought into the sub from the other end. No bueno. It's one thing to have a bunch of users doing it, but seeing the subreddit become another instance mirroring #falloutequestria (one party being 'in charge,' the other being users) really made me concerned. Add onto that his track record for being probably one of the last people you'd ever want to try diplomacy, and... well, yeah.  I try to stay as neutral as possible."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,4fffs,3,Sat Jun 20 21:13:25 2015 UTC,"Call me cynical, but maybe inviting the owner of a place so biased and authoritarian to moderate here, in one of the places those displaced came to, was a bad idea.  Because it kinda did turn out that he was biased, childish, completely and utterly unimpartial and absolutely the opposite of what anyone would want in a person of authority, like we told you.  I think you are mistaken in your assessment that ""it's your scuffle/grudge with Nomad and his past"" because clearly, its not his past, its still his present.  This sub played its part as one of the few places where the lack of censorship allowed actual progress to be made, and immediately thereafter... for some reason... to many people's disdain... you brought the censor onto the moderation team, under the promise that he was different and would act different, and he'd even apologise for being the censor that caused all this.  And he wasn't different, at all.  Fortunately he practically did nothing in moderation duty before showing his colors and the damage done was merely reputational.  Like it or not, the sub recognizes the existance of an issue that affects writers, and the irc denies the existence of that issue and harasses and forces out anyone who speaks of it. Until that changes there is no bridge to build between our communities. Hell, how many people here are only here because they were forced out of there?"
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,sk2150ad,3,Sun Jun 21 05:29:25 2015 UTC,"He was given a second chance with a long heart-to-heart with me in private over expectations.  Ultimately, it resorted back to this.  I do not regret trying to make comprimises - risky as they may have been - and give an opportunity.  Personally, I feel for him.  Not because I like him or have a history with him.  I know what it's like and the stress it causes to try to keep a vastly diverse community together.  Some people can do it without taking things personally, and some people can't.  This whole mess (Somber/PH, IRC vs Sub, trolls drama) has been wearing on my psyche too.  Sometimes I feel like I need an exit strategy or I'm going to lose myself too.  This is why I bear no ill will towards him.  I'm sad that it didn't work out, but that doesn't mean there aren't other opportunities in the future to mend relations a little with the IRC.  Like it or not, they are just as much part of this fandom as we.  Also, they have a prescene on this subreddit too, so it's not like we should view them as seperate people.  At the very least, he made it clean (for me).  I did not have to take sides.  It was a clear case of reddit rule breaking."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,sk2150ad,2,Mon Jun 22 14:07:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for managing it as patiently as you have.  I'd never written Horizons at all if I'd know how much strife it would cause.  I never wanted to cause damage to this community.  Just write my story.
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,Harakou,3,Sat Jun 20 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"As an artist myself, I do not like discouraging artists from making their art (or narratives in this case).  I saw the flaws like everyone else who tried to point them out, but I saw them as perfect inperfections.  Like it or not, you've written a story I've come to love, and you shouldn't feel discourage from future endeavors."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,KaiserVonIkapoc,3,Mon Jun 22 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"Your story hasn't caused any damage to the community, and this is coming from someone who constantly flips back and forth on loving and hating PH.  The issue is a lack of mature discussion, which has nothing to do with you. Wherever I've gone, talking about what I liked or didn't like about your story always gets vitriolic responses. Especially when I try to do both at once! That's not your fault as a author, so please don't feel guilty over it. We as a community need to understand when one is simply discussing something and when one is 'fanboying' or 'hating.'  I'm currently at a point where I'm hating PH because of the events that transpired in it (and it has nothing to do with Scotch Tape, for the record.) Even where I currently stand though, I really don't want you blaming yourself simply for creating something prolific. That's just ridiculous. :P"
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,IrrelevantEraserhead,2,Tue Jun 23 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"Your story isnt really the issue here, the issue is people blindly protecting your story to the point of hurting other writers and stifling conversation and making it impossible for anything to be done to help other stories up.  If nomad and codepony were never the fascist 'party is always right' types then maybe the fallout equestria spotlight thing would have happened years ago, rather than only recently. And our community would not be fractured into islands of vastly different political persuasions (here were we can talk about how maybe it would be fair for some other fics to get a leg up, and there where its far right crony capitalism hard work earned no communists allowed)"
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,MySecretClopAccount,0,Sun Jun 21 05:37:04 2015 UTC,"So are we saying that its our fault for having a grudge with nomad that caused him to act unmoderatorly, have a climate-denialesque position enforced in his environment and organize a downvote brigade?  Because I think it is far more reasonable to conclude that nomad was always unmoderatorly, shot down anyone who didn't agree with his narrative (that this community with the creation of the EQD deal has rejected) and that is what caused us to object to him being made a moderator."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,E-Squid,3,Sun Jun 21 05:53:22 2015 UTC,"I took issue to the nature of which the grudge was handled.  Not that there is a grudge.  I once was like many of you.  I fought unrelenting for justice.  As I grew older, I realized that it's not always worth the unintended damage it causes.  I get that the majority of the people who participate on this subreddit are of a similar mindset, and the only way to foster a community is to appeal to the majority.  That said, I created and fostered this community from the beginning, and my interests are the long-term stability of it.  Inciting inter-fandom drama - to me - puts that stability at risk.  At the end of the day, do what you must.  Just try not to be the harbinger of the community's destruction.    Ha!  A PH reference"
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,MySecretClopAccount,6,Mon Jun 22 14:25:49 2015 UTC,"Noone is allowed to be critical of PH on the irc or complain or lament that every other fic faces unfair, unmeritorious, disproportionate discrimination, even though recent events here (the murky thread, the somber apology thread and the what can be done thread) show that actually that is and has always been the case and something needed to be done about it rather than deleting all reference.  The problem was so bad and due to the censorship had caused so much bottled up frustration that as soon as Somber waltzed in and uttered the words to the equivalent of ""maybe you are just bad writers"" there was a tidal wave of frothy, steaming, not-allowed-to-be-talked-about vitriol about how that was arrogant as fuck and also completely wrong.  The problem was so bad that a system of democracy had to be drafted to deal with it and finally give other fics a chance against PH.  Anyhoos, it was somehow decided to bring Nomad, the eternal president of the Democratic Peoples Republic of True Fallout Equestria, and the cancerous cause of this septic wound in our community to come here into our free and happy nirvana to moderate for us, because apparently the cause of discord here is not enough jackboots stomping on a human face forever."
falloutequestria,3ag6qx,finalsight618,7,Sat Jun 20 05:23:16 2015 UTC,"Welp, no loss in my eyes then. Wasn't really familiar with this drama but if someone wants to downvote brigade for the sake of a petty personal victory, fuck 'em."

falloutequestria,3aebt1,AmethystWind,6,Fri Jun 19 12:48:54 2015 UTC,"Well, usually in these things I'll big up some fics I like from other authors.  This time, permit me a little selfishness. I'm gonna open with my own.  Fallout Equestria: Old Souls is my take on the FOE-verse. Chock-full of reasonably coherent writing, wildly varied levels of conflict, deliciously complicated intergroup dynamics, and the occasional viewpoint character switch.  It's got snarkers, haters, hatin' snarkers and snarkin' haters. Philosophy of world, pony, and ponies within the world. EIGHT main characters and a whole host of secondary and tertiary guys for each. EQUESTRIAN CANADA! Familial moments, affectionate friendships, intense rivalries and a running commentary on the very nature of love and hate.  It's pretty well along by this point, at over 300,000 words, so you've got a literary feast to get through, and I would hope to claim that there's something there for everybody.  The usual viewpoint character IS a Stable unicorn filly/mare, not gonna lie, but she's a pretty far cry from Littlepip. Most obviously because she utterly lacks telekinesis. She's an ice princess, magic wise, but not even close to a real one.  If that sounds like something you could enjoy, feel free to go read it, even if it's just to tell me what I'm doing wrong. Feedback, when respectful, is always appreciated."

falloutequestria,3aebt1,AmethystWind,3,Fri Jun 19 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"On around 30,000 words right now. Will probably be around 40,000 by the time I'm finished.  (Don't worry, I split chapters up into 5-8k chunks for easier reading)"
falloutequestria,3aebt1,volrathxp,5,Fri Jun 19 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"You know, I'd like to push a little more discussion over towards ""The ABC's of Fallout Equestria"".  This was such an awesome project with a bunch of really awesome authors, and it hardly gets any love like it should get.  I'm not just saying this because I'm a part of it, of course.  There are plenty of amazing little short stories in this anthology, and it's well worth checking out."
falloutequestria,3aebt1,Fallingsnow57,3,Sat Jun 20 13:18:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that project was a long time in the works. I also pitched a story there, and I know that myself and the other authors involved would definitely like more people reading it."
falloutequestria,3aebt1,volrathxp,2,Tue Jun 23 09:16:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  The best part about it was getting to sit down and read them all for the first time.  It was awesome seeing the dynamics of how each story flowed into the next.  I may have to sit down and re-read it again when I have time.
falloutequestria,3aebt1,MrMarbles99,2,Tue Jun 23 11:02:36 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear! Each story had its own flavor and personality that brought out of the project as a whole. It showed off how creative the Fo:E authors could be--from the more well-known writers to those who are up and coming (shameless plug). Seriously though, y'all should check this collection out."
falloutequestria,3aebt1,lordlaneus,6,Wed Jun 24 08:22:59 2015 UTC,"A place to pimp my sidefic? Don't mind if I do.  It's about Scouts Honor, a pony from Stable 16, which was designed to make it impossible to keep permanent records so no one in the stable even knows why Scout has a weird horn coming out of his head.  It's only two chapters (12k words) right now, but I'm going to publish the third one pretty soon."
falloutequestria,3aebt1,RoMSie,3,Fri Jun 19 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"I would like to recommend Wasteland Bouquet.   9 chapters in, this work is full of moments of cuteness that will give you diabeetus. The story is light-hearted, reads like a charm and doesn't bother with over extending arks as it knows when to abrutedly change pace to make the story go on.  My only remark for future readers is that the author Cascadejackal do switch from time to time between past and present tenses to show the change of timelines. Similarly, he switches between the main characters during the story (so keep in mind the ""I"" will change claws and hooves over the chapters).  Go read it! Naow!"
falloutequestria,3ad3yk,Telgin_Pony,2,Fri Jun 19 03:22:56 2015 UTC,I should really check out this story - is it any good?
falloutequestria,3ad3yk,Cecnar,2,Fri Jun 19 15:47:40 2015 UTC,"For full disclosure, I'm an editor/pre-reader for the story and clearly biased, but I'd definitely say yes. Especially if you want an all-around well-written story with a unique protagonist, exploring a part of the Fallout Equestria setting that doesn't get very much attention. Even more so if you like Fillydephia or griffons.  On the other hand, there isn't very much action, and the story takes place almost, if not entirely, within Fillydelphia, so if you go into it expecting action, high adventure, and wasteland exploration, you may be disappointed."
falloutequestria,3abtgq,mlp-NovelIdea,3,Thu Jun 18 20:47:16 2015 UTC,Awesome! downloading now.
falloutequestria,3abtgq,lordlaneus,2,Thu Jun 18 22:53:50 2015 UTC,Hope you enjoy it. :)
falloutequestria,3abtgq,MySecretClopAccount,3,Fri Jun 19 00:02:34 2015 UTC,Is this compatible with Littlepip's Fixes and Rebalances?  I'm asking because both rename some items.
falloutequestria,3abtgq,MySecretClopAccount,3,Fri Jun 19 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"Funny that you ask that. In the full GoE, I have a line saying that I'm required to recommend that mod as part of a legal agreement with the Equestrian Legal Society. You do NOT want to screw with Pony lawyers.  To actually answer your question, there should be no issues. The weapons and armor have unique names and FormIDs (how the game identifies objects). Smuggler's Run weapons and armor will likely not be affected by any of the balance changes made.   The renaming for many of the items is a purely cosmetic thing on the Smuggler's Run side. I'd recommend having GoE:SR last in your load order so you're sure to get all the cosmetic changes, but still get the various fixes.  If you come across something, drop us a line on the Nexus Mods page and let us know so we can fix it."
falloutequestria,3abtgq,TheShadowKick,3,Fri Jun 19 00:30:46 2015 UTC,Thanks!
falloutequestria,3abtgq,mikewalker11,3,Fri Jun 19 01:35:27 2015 UTC,I'm unclear on what exactly this changes. Is it just new items and quests? New locations (beyond the mentioned safehouse)?
falloutequestria,3abtgq,mikewalker11,3,Fri Jun 19 01:02:29 2015 UTC,"I intentionally made some of the changes non-specific, hopefully to get a ""discovery surprise"" as folks are playing through it. I remember that was one of my favorite things when playing through the Texture Replacement for Fallout 3 by JHawk1666.   The more amusing thing is as I wrote this, I realized there were a few things I forgot to add to the package. So thank you indirectly for reminding me to fix (hopefully) all the things!  That being said, if you want a more thorough breakdown of what's in Smuggler's Run, check out our Readme on the NexusMods Site."

It's not written for you, nor do you have to read it at all.  Just ignore it and go on with your life. This is what I expect from some antsy teenager who thinks speaking out is cool.   Next time you think about criticising something that has absolutely nothing to do with you, think. Just think. Is it worth mentioning at all? Are you that selfish that you want people to stop doing what they enjoy, just because you don't like it?   And finally, ""raping an awesome franchise."" Really? Jesus dude, you just be, what, 12?

falloutequestria,39uy07,HomageFoE,4,Mon Jun 15 09:13:16 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS, as usual.  Well, it is good to be back and boy in what way.  The beginning was something needed, the lull before the attack, before the battle. And how everyone brought their skills together, from List Seeker to Weatherwane to just our main gang. And I did get a chuckle at Murky's snapping at the lack of railings, finally he got to say it XD  But the real thing starts as the Enclaive firsts attacks. And holy shit is it intense, just the scale of it is so large it really feels shocking. As a calculated strike should.  And although you worried about how to portray the battle the best, Fuzzy, I gotta say that the transitions to each part of the battle were seamless. It all kept the intense pace, and even the customary 'Shackles' men want Murky' part felt good. I especially liked the rooftop battle, it was really nice to see how the ponies there held back from the griffins. How the sight of one of the griffins dying crappily pushed others to attack as a revenge. And then..the Enclaive. Just the enclaive, holy crap.  The frontline battle was really good,too. The constant push and pull of forces, Brim and Whitemane trying to get back up to help them. Intense as heck, and the moment of being saved -felt- relieving.  And finally, the ending. I knew Wildcard wasn't out yet. Now as a cyborg, too. But I do find Shackles focus on the mall pretty amusing. Filly is taking HEAVY hits, from a force that has mastered air combat. How easily could the Bloodletter army be spotted and then moved down by an Enclaive ship while Shackles is boasting? XD But then, that is his character. He'll rather have his eternal slavery than put the raiders into protecting the city.  All in all, waiting eagerly for the next chapter ^"

I may have to check the clarity of it though, so ta for noting! :p"
falloutequestria,39uy07,Fuzzyveevee,3,Mon Jun 15 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"No problem ^  Adding to previous comments; The scale. It is very 40k (fittingly), with 7 hours of battle before the attack on the mall even starts. And the constant movement of troops really reminded me of a 40k game.  Oh, dang. The line is something like ""Twitching and cybered"", so I assumed both him and Brutus were cybered. I guess WildCard is just tough enough to brush off being burned XD"

I wanted a character that was a sort of mechanical savant, a character who could cobble together anything from a mess of spare parts.   I wanted her to be more than that, though. Despite being born and raised in it, I wanted her to be the opposite of your average jaded wastelander.

I wouldn't really say I ever found my way into the community as a content creator, but I shuffled in as a fan pretty quick. I did a lot of lurking in the early days. Still do, actually.   Greaser, all the way. She's a blast to write and easily my favorite character out of the entire cast. Her optimistic personality and clever nature make her the perfect foil to all of the other more world-weary characters. It's a fun dynamic to play with."

falloutequestria,39pl1j,KrootLoops,3,Sat Jun 13 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"Here be spoilers!  Originally, there were a few more flashback scenes I'd planned when Astral is dying in Mach's hooves. One such scene was a nice lunch they had as adults not long before the story starts. From it, you could tell that their relationship had gotten a little distant because of the military, but that their unbreakable bond was still intact. It really showed how much they cared about one another and I made the decision to cut it so I wouldn't drag the scene out and diminish the impact."

falloutequestria,39pl1j,ErthiloV2,3,Sun Jun 14 13:25:00 2015 UTC,I have a few very very important question.   Why doesn't Mach marry Caltrops? This is obviously something that needs to be fixed ASAP. Why do all the characters I draw and like die? That is just mean Tofu. Will the super secret things be released with the next chapter or when they're all done? Wobble.
falloutequestria,39pl1j,KrootLoops,2,Sun Jun 14 14:28:14 2015 UTC,1- erth pls  2 - Stop liking the characters that die!  3 - Next chapter.  4 - ERTH PLS
falloutequestria,39pl1j,KaiserVonIkapoc,2,Sun Jun 14 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"I do need to talk to you more on Skype, but bleh. So let me spam you with many questions:  1) What got you into the fandom, both MLP and FO:E. Also why did you begin writing Outlaw?  2) Who is best pony in Outlaw?  3) What's with you big ol' interest in the Enclave?  4) Is Mach a pony or a duck?  5) What was, by far, the hardest thing you had to do in Outlaw (barring rewrites)?  6) Who has da booty: Greaser or Solara?  7) Had you ever thought of writing motorwagons into your story?"
falloutequestria,39pl1j,KrootLoops,3,Sat Jun 13 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"1 - MLP was just sheer curiosity. I kept hearing about it on the internet--as you do--and I wrote it off as just another fad thing. But when I saw this video I immediately decided I had to see what all the fuss was about. That led to a binge of the whole first season, and I wound up on the train before S2 started.   FoE was a different matter. I'd managed to remain unaware of it until I saw the completed post on EqD. I'd had my experiences with fanfiction before and I was immediately skeptical, but something about it drew me in regardless. ""What harm could one chapter do?"" I thought. Buuuut that one chapter led to several, and three days later I was finished with it  As far as Outlaw? Seeing an actually decently-written fanfiction made me want to see what I could do. I wanted to try and give other people the same great feeling I got from reading FoE.  2 - Greaser, natch.  3 - Through what little Calamity told us, kkat left just enough to give us a taste of what the Enclave was really about. I wanted more. I wanted to see what life was like for an Enclave pegasus growing up in an indoctrinated populace, what it was like having to deal with food and population restrictions, what daily life was like--all of that. No one else was doing it when I started writing Outlaw, so I made that my goal.  4 - Quack.  5 - Probably bridging the gap between all the major plot points with filler. It wasn't until I finished that I realized I didn't necessarily need to fluff the story out like I did. But that's what rewrites are for!  6 - Well, my personal headcanon is that pegasi have toned athletic butts and unicorns have generous squishy butts. So it really depends on what your definition of a desirable booty is, I suppose.  7 - With a main cast that's comprised mostly of flying creatures, I'd have to say no. They never really factored into my plans at all."

falloutequestria,39pl1j,KrootLoops,2,Mon Jun 15 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"Just one pony takes approximately an hour. Maybe less or more depending. Add more ponies, add more time. Complex things like clothing/magic auras also add to the time. I tend to avoid things like clothing/armor because I'm really not good enough to manage them with any sort of quality. It's also why I won't take commissions.  As for sources, I use mainly screencaps. If I need to finagle a pose that doesn't show up anywhere in the show, I'll Frankenstein one from multiple appropriate screencaps. If I see another vector or a drawn piece with a pose I really like, I'll also attempt to replicate it in show style."

As far as things that probably won't make it in (the little details, things you probably know, but won't really end up in writing), what's her background like? How'd she grow up, any sort of... commentary you'd like to talk about there?  I... like her. She's pretty cool."
falloutequestria,39pl1j,KrootLoops,2,Mon Jun 15 02:11:20 2015 UTC,"I never really went into detail with her background, but I did toss some things around when I was considering how to answer some questions on the askblog. I like to think that Solara is the daughter of a very high-ranking government or military official (perhaps even one of the councilponies?) and as a result of the privilege, comes from quite a large family.   I guess I kind of see her as the rebellious older sister? A ""bucks authority"" type. The kind of sister that leaves home before she's old enough to legally live on her own because she can't stand living under her parents' roof and dealing with their strict rules.  ...Or the kind of sister that would join the military because her parents wanted her to be a career mare.  Although, even taking that all into consideration it doesn't necessarily mean she's the type to abandon everyone. Quite the opposite, actually. She tends to care a little too much about her loved ones, as you'll see later on in the rewrites. Uh, much later. Like, way later.  I think you might be the first person to actually like her, though. That's not something I usually hear. Although granted, I usually don't hear anything about her."

I kinda wanted to do my own little FOE story so I actually wrote a few chapters of one and put it online. Turns out I'm pretty meh at writing so I scrapped the thing.   Then I wanted to try again, but something a little different. I've done things like ask blogs before on tumblr, and I've always wanted to try out doing something like a Quest/CYOA.  I thought it would be a neat idea and something different to a fic, so after a few tests I made StableQuest, where other people could write the plot for me!    I'm not sure I could pick a favourite, it's kinda difficult and my mood changes what I like a lot of the time. I guess a fairly safe bet would be this silly music video I did a while back. I just threw it together in a night when I was a bit sleep deprived and put it on the Internet. It was well recieved at least! One of my favourite things that I still like to refer people to is the original RubyQuest, being one of the first quest type things and also an example of pretty good interactive storytelling. Also most stuff by Weaver has a great sense of humour as well as being able to tell a lot of things visually without needed a hugely detailed art style. I have to say I take a lot of inspiration from his stuff.   You will be forgiven when you can spell my name correctly!  Nah don't worry it's hard I get it wrong a lot too."

It's about how the world of Equestria could become a world like Fallout through motivations that, hopefully, would be fairly believable for the characters involved.  Obviously some liberties have to be taken with the mashing of post apocalyptia and colourful magical horses, but it was pulled off pretty well. Most of the fic is about exploring the world that was created, both post and pre-bombing, and exploring the suggestion of the main character.  It's kinda hard to summarise the plot, being 625,000 words and all, but it builds a great world, and tells a compelling story.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes both MLP and post apocalyptia."

falloutequestria,38rtes,0megaRidley,3,Sun Jun 7 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"Hey Erth ! Glad to see the AAD is still a thing, it's really a cool event to discover new artists or learn more about the one's you're already stalking.  So, here are my questions ! 1. Digital art or traditional art ? 2. Tablet ? Software ? Tools ? Plugins ?  And that's it. :3"
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,3,Sat Jun 6 13:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this is great and I hope it continues to help more people check out more creative types!   I can really only do digital art, using a pencil has always resulted in odd looking abominations. Also no ctrl+z! I enjoy the results of both mediums though. I use a tablet PC, a Lenovo x201t with PaintTool SAI. Both software and hardware are a bit old, but it gets the job done. For drawing nowadays I just use a binary brush because I like the effect, and I like things nice and simple.   EDIT: A word"
falloutequestria,38rtes,spookyray,3,Sat Jun 6 18:19:42 2015 UTC,How do you create the animated panels in Stablequest? Are you gonna do animated shorts of SQ in the future?
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,3,Sat Jun 6 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"For the majority of them I draw the scene, or bits of the scene and then move them around and do stuff with them frame by frame in Adobe Fireworks.  This is obviously very time consuming and a very inefficient way of doing things, but it at least gives the impression of animations.  I've been trying to relearn how to use flash to make more nicely animated stuff more quickly, so animated shorts may be a thing in the future."
falloutequestria,38rtes,funtom5niper,3,Sun Jun 7 12:30:11 2015 UTC,How did you get the idea to give Sierra the big ears?
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,3,Sat Jun 6 23:13:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I didn't initially, but I did accidentally draw her ears a little longer trying to get her general size intact. Someone pointed this out, and I thought it was pretty funny so I just rolled with it. Thankfully, other people liked it too!"
falloutequestria,38rtes,ponystalker,3,Sun Jun 7 12:33:22 2015 UTC,Whose your hero? Real and not.
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,3,Sun Jun 7 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think I have anyone I'd call my 'hero'. I have quite a few people I look up to, but I couldn't point out one in particular, in real life at least.  Sticking with the FOE theme though, I thought SteelHooves was a good 'hero'."
falloutequestria,38rtes,ponystalker,2,Sun Jun 7 12:36:11 2015 UTC,"So, spill. Who are your real life inspirations?"
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,3,Sun Jun 7 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm, alright.   Well I guess my parents are my primary rolemodels and inspirations, they work so hard and brought me up the best they could and I wouldn't want to let them down for anything. Family is important and they took care of me and made me who I am today. I want to do everything I can to repay them for that, by becoming the best I can be.  Not gonna tell them about ponies though, nope."
falloutequestria,38rtes,TheDoctorHam,3,Sun Jun 7 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"So how much of StableQuest is your own plan, and how much input comes from user submissions?"
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,3,Sun Jun 7 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"Almost all actions the characters take are directly or because of user inputs. I guess the closest analogy is a DM and a player.  All the user inputs decide the player's actions and I would be the DM, bringing up the world and other characters and things for the players to talk to/visit/kill/etc. Though the characters themselves have their own goal/motivations/morals/etc. and will usually resist doing something wildly out of character for them.  Things can of course happen without user input, it wouldn't be a very coherent story otherwise, but I'm doing my best not to railroad anyone down any specific path I have in mind. I have quite a few notes and events that I would very much like to happen, but I've had to come up with more than a couple of things on the fly due to inputs."
falloutequestria,38rtes,ReversedCarrot,3,Sun Jun 7 13:00:47 2015 UTC,"Describe yourself using: A fruit, a country and a few random words."

falloutequestria,38rtes,somerandompone,2,Sun Jun 7 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"So are you like, an artist/designer? Or what is it that you do when you are not drawing ponies? Have you drawn or created any other MLP-related stuff online? Do you offer autographed-prints of your drawings?"
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,3,Sat Jun 6 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"Not an artist/designer in any professional sense, nowhere near good enough for that, just a cs university student right now.  I used to run 'Ask Octavia' and a few other tumblr blogs, but they're all gone now. Obviously there's still StableQuest, and I draw stuff and post it on DA and Tumblr.  Didn't think there would be any interest in autographed prints of my drawings, though people are more than welcome to ask!"
falloutequestria,38rtes,jskiddy99,2,Sat Jun 6 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"i have been following stablequest for a while but it sorta stops and starts with long breaks, and that just loses the plot a little. Why's that? R you torturing us?"
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,4,Sat Jun 6 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to, honest!  Just, I have real motivation problems. Sometimes I feel pretty down about a lot of stuff and it stops me wanting to draw or do anything really. Then I have periods where I feel really creative and draw non-stop. I'd do a buffer for updates, but the nature of the format means I can't really.  For the future at least, I'm going to stick to once a week as much as I can, and anyone can feel free to poke me if I miss my schedule."
falloutequestria,38rtes,iansmith000,2,Sat Jun 6 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"Where is Stablequest in the main fic's timeline? Are you sticking strictly or loosely to kkat's universe? Oh yeah, when can we expect the next update? Please? :P"
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,4,Sat Jun 6 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"Next update will of course be SoonTM.  SQ's timeline compared to the main fic should be fairly simple to work out once I get a few more updates out, and I like readers piecing things together on their own, so I won't say too much on that here.  I'm trying to stick to the main fic's canon as much as I can. There shouldn't be anything that outright contradicts or overrules anything in there without either a good explanation (that may come immediately or later), or massive oversight/forgetfulness by me. Anyone is free to point out any inconsistencies they can see and I'll either try to explain them or make spooky noises and hope they forget.   So there probably won't be a scene where Sierra hooks up with Littlepip, becomes the Element of Magic, and then revives SteelHooves by sticking his head back on with wonderglue.  Probably."
falloutequestria,38rtes,cultofthepony,2,Sat Jun 6 18:43:48 2015 UTC,Are Wander and Sierra going to get it on at some point? Or is she going to turn out to be lesbian?
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,2,Sun Jun 7 04:27:47 2015 UTC,"Sierra's orientation (and Wander's for that matter) is something I'm leaving to up to inputs.  I do of course have my own preferences in mind for them, but whether they get together or not is going to have to be determined through the story."
falloutequestria,38rtes,somerandompone,2,Sun Jun 7 12:44:43 2015 UTC,What's Sierra's back story? Where did she come from?
falloutequestria,38rtes,ErthiloV2,2,Sun Jun 7 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"That's something I want to explore in SQ rather than just say it all, but I will say that there are a few hints already, and she wasn't always so jumpy around new people."
falloutequestria,38rtes,Nephrited,3,Sun Jun 7 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"Stop using my OC, Erth! :P  I'm aware that's not a question but you know full well I don't need to ask any. Hello, /r/falloutequestria !"

falloutequestria,38rl5r,Blueishbagel,9,Sat Jun 6 10:17:41 2015 UTC,"Back when the mall ponies were sent to explore the stable in the outskirts of Filly, Mosin gave glimmer a bolt action without/with broken safety and told her ""Is gun, is not safe"".  Fast forward in the stable exploration and they're facing one of Barb's shades who used her magic to pull the safety on all the guns pointed at her. All... except Glimmer's. Those were Glimmer's parting words before pulling the trigger."

One clarification though, the video is from the Minneapolis Mayoral election which has the rule that you only rank your top three (there were 35 candidates for the Mayor's job, imagine having to number them all!). In our rules however you don't rank your top three, you rank all the stories (which will usually be three, but can be more).  If there were draws in the monthly threads there could be four or more stories to rank in order of best to not-so-best, not just the top three.  But nice find on that video 2woToned! It's nice to see material tailored for Americans for better other voting systems."

Now obviously that changes from reader to reader, and from story to story. Though for a quantifiable value I'd say at least 60%, then see if you want to continue or if it isn't really your thing.  It's going to be a bit demanding on the part of the readers to go through three (and sometimes more) of these stories in a month.

Fallout: Equestria - Mending Hearts  This story is set in the same canon as ""Starlight"" is, but you don't really need to have read Starlight to understand it.  It's about three young ponies who go out to find a way to save their mother, who has a fatal heart condition.  It's only 2 chapters in thus far, and I am currently on track to start working on Chapter 3 this monday.

It follows the story of a pair of friends from childbirth, set ten years after the end of the original, and their attempts to get back home after a scavenging trip goes ridiculously south. A bit more lighthearted in some respects than your usual story, it's got a good few scenes for comedic relief and the nature of the characters means that hard drama and angst isn't much the norm. Explosions, embarrassing moments, and bickering over which soda brand is the best ahead."

It's a collection of 26 short fics by 26 different authors (including a couple you'll probably recognize from some of the more famous FoE fics) about a number of different stories from the Equestrian Wasteland. Organized by G-Man64, who also wrote the prologue, epilogue, and letter G."

Next time around it'll be Wasteland Economics and Outlaw, but they are still within the first ten chapters each (in the case of Outlaw's rewrites. Original fic is finished and should be checked out).

If you have ever played cowboys and Indians, or any other game of pretend have you roleplayed in a way, and roleplaying on a forum is not that different.  The best way that I can explain the kind of roleplaying that we are doing on the forum are telling stories together, each player taking a character each in a story and tells what that exact character are doing.

As the head of a collaboration group, these kinds of issues are actually good to be aware of so we can avoid problems in the future. No matter what, there was a lack of communication here and my biggest take-away is that communication is paramount in a collaborative group."
falloutequestria,378rlg,dizziestbeef,8,Tue May 26 21:39:50 2015 UTC,"This post covers a lot of the issues that seem to be plaguing STS, but at the same time you don't seem to show any real move to fix these issues.   From the outside STS looks like the entire command structure has ground to a complete halt, where the directors, and people who run each group are in their own little clique, leaving the people below them completely out of the loop.  Which it seems has been happening for a very long time now, the leadership STS has is at best an armchair quarterback, and at worst has become completely disconnected with the people they are supposed to manage.  Just as well I see the lines of ""we were going to..."" a lot.  If you were going to move someone, or promote someone, you would have done it months ago.  The second major issue I see here is the same issue that happened to Duke Nukem Forever, and Half Life 3.  Changes in management, changes in style, changes in writing.  All those things add up to huge delays, push those long enough and maybe you'll release your first episode far too late after anyone who was once possibly a fan can only stare down in contempt and say ""it took you how long to make this?""  In short, your end product will never live up to the hype that people keep pumping into it.  I have heard rumors and jokes as things stand about STS' animation being Half Life 3.  This post also has a distinct military feel to it.  From the whole ""we want the best for everyone"" after clearly doing nothing of the sort, with the branch of ""here is exactly what we are doing to prevent this from happening again"" I have expected to be shown a power point to make this look like some brand new 2LT drafted it up.  With copious amounts of butthurt leaking out from almost every line.  Lastly there is the issue of the renaming of canon characters.  To me this sounds like a ploy to eventually monetize your work and somehow slip under Hasbro's radar, or somewhere into fair use.  Which has a whole mess of problems by itself, boiling down to that if your staff are doing this for the money, and not for the love of the story, you need to start culling people from the top down.  In closing, maybe Redcap's little rant will help STS grow and actually get something done aside from yet another teaser, but it sounds like STS is full of problems that people are either unwilling, or unable to change.  TL;DR  1) there seems to be some serious communication problems among management.  2) This animation will probably air its first episode when Half Life 3 comes out."
falloutequestria,378rlg,Mochipants,2,Tue May 26 04:00:18 2015 UTC,Ya hit the nail on the head.
falloutequestria,378rlg,dizziestbeef,1 point,Tue May 26 06:51:26 2015 UTC,"You're right in some respects, but no organization is perfect.   So to answer a couple of bits.   1) We wanted our departments to act semi-independently as it has sped up progress on so many things. Vector was the sad exception to the rule.   2) We've got about a first ""season"" of scripts written and ready. As the rewriting wasn't utterly total for the first season. (indeed four episodes were retained right off the bat)  3) We knew about the two guys going into the military for months, so it took us a while to find a useful solution. Otherwise yes, we do promote folks quickly as and when.  4) We actually have official permission from Kkat to animate this with rights etc. One of the caveats to said rights? We're not allowed to monetize or make a profit.   5) The names and other changes were made as part of a wider C&D policy in responce to DHX's more active litigation policy. We want the story to come to light and if that means changing some stuff, so be it. We knew we'd have folks against it both inside and outside the studio and we're willing to take the hit so we're not taken down altogether.  6) We intend to beat Half Life 3's release date by at least 2 months. ;)"
falloutequestria,378rlg,SilverlightPony,2,Tue May 26 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"1) when different groups of people are working on a project like this you need more of an osmosis than a separation, which causes nothing but disconnects.   2) implying that there is still great amounts of drift from the original Kkat story  3) that's like saying you have a broken leg, but didn't want to go to the doctor because that requires going out of you way.  4) Could have fooled me  5) I am not convinced that changing colors, and names is going to be enough to keep Hasbro off their C&D button  6) Until it's actually out, and not a Duke Nukem Forever, you can't say it's not a Half Life 3"
falloutequestria,378rlg,hammil,2,Tue May 26 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"DHX doesn't litigate.  Hasbro is the one who owns the My Little Pony IP, they're the ones that would throw C&Ds at you from the MLP side of things.  That said, IMHO you're much more likely to get fired upon by Bethesda for infringing upon their Fallout IP, and they won't give half a shit what the characters are named."
falloutequestria,378rlg,2woToned,3,Tue May 26 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, STS doesn't have anything to worry about from Bethesda, because the scope of the 'Fallout' trademark is games, not animation or anything else. They most certainly do need to worry about Hasbro, however, so renaming the characters isn't actually the dumbest idea.  In my personal opinion though, I would've preferred subtle changes to the problematic trademarks (Twibright et. al.) rather than full renaming. Personally."
falloutequestria,378rlg,hammil,2,Tue May 26 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"I don't believe renaming anything will prevent Cease and Desists. I can't start selling a line of children's toys after my own creation, an anthropomorphic rodent with white gloves and round ears, Ronald Rat. Hasbro can freely C&D anything they want, they just have to deal with the legal ramifications. IANAL, but if Hasbro sent one to STS (or any project group for that matter) the only way to argue that it was fair use is through a court of law. If that happens you will get Beth's attention and the attention of anyone who could claim damages from the projects existence. That in turn draws legal attention to not only other FOE projects but any projects this fandom, or the brony fandom, ever wishes to accomplish.  The act of trying to struggle out of being shut down legally could possibly damn us all."

That's only because Mickey's shape is trademarked, with a scope that includes children's toys. It's true that you can be sent legal letters anyway (hell, they sometimes use automated systems), but unless that letter includes the phrase 'show up at court' you aren't actually obligated to do anything. The self-proclaimed IP holder has to be the one to begin litigation if a C&D is ignored, and if you've read up on the relevant laws and made sure that your project is sound (even if it skirts the edges) they won't bother.  Well, it could be argued that maybe they will bother anyway and just hope you don't have any money to mount a proper defence, but we haven't actually seen that happen as of yet, in this fandom."
falloutequestria,378rlg,Mochipants,2,Tue May 26 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"With Hasbro, its usually the projects that either extend themselves out of the fandom (Fighting is Magic) or are so close to show style that it can be confused as official Hasbro animation (Jan Animations).  Even then, it's an overzealous legal team that has to be told to STFU by Hasbro retroactively.  Last time I heard something about their legal team, it was that it is an outsourced thing.  It's more the hand and the head not communicating than Hasbro being a dick.  Now copyright characters on dakimakuras?  Yeah they've gone after people for that cause it uses their IP in a sexual manner.  Unless STS decides to try for some internet grammy (or whatever award they give to top Youtubers and the like), takes it to a non-pony convention or event, etc, I doubt Hasbro would care.    TL;DR - Stay inside the pony fandom."
falloutequestria,378rlg,dizziestbeef,1 point,Tue May 26 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to note that when Bethesda/Zenimax recently trademarked the Nuka-Cola brand the copyrights were worded in such a way that it actually gave plenty of room for Wayside Creations web series, Nuka-Break, to carry on unimpeded.  The Writing Team originally did go down the route of using fandom-nicknames or shortened names for plenty of the copyrighted characters. On the basis we could argue that, portraying the much older characters or even ""fandom"" characters made it a derivative artwork.   Not too long after though Hasbro then took the name ""DJ-Pon3"" (a fandom nickname) and copyrighted it to sell special edition Vinyl Scratch toys.  We were also later advised that derivative artwork is still somewhat of a legal gray area and decided that as 95%+ of the story is about Kkat's characters and he Ministry Mares were there to provide backstory to the wider world (something we can do a lot easier visually) we should change them just to be on the safe side.  We knew we'd get complaints for doing it both from within and without, but I'd rather see it happen then get bogged down in preventable issues."

falloutequestria,3756zs,theweltinator,6,Sun May 24 23:52:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on which fic you read.  Vast majority of Rangers are earth ponies.  Some unicorns remove their horns, some prefer to rank up through the scribe route, some have custom helmets made and some have tiny horns that allow them to wear normal helmets."
falloutequestria,3756zs,finalsight618,5,Mon May 25 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"As a fic writer you need to learn to balance when to apply canon and when to fuck canon off because the canon makes no sense.  Technically speaking In the original FoE unicorns 'can't' be steel rangers as their horn can't fit in the helmet.  This however is really stupid and makes no sense at all because not only would it be incredibly easy to accommodate a horn in the armour by just cutting a hole and then allowing metal tube to fit over it, it makes no sense to be cutting out a race that can use firearms without needing saddles.  So canon speak, unicorns can't use the armour typically, but honestly just say tits to it and find a way to allow them to because it's honestly a bad military decision to not allow unicorn rangers and thus makes no sense."
falloutequestria,3756zs,Manamanky,5,Mon May 25 06:40:03 2015 UTC,"There are unicorn SRs, but they're all scribes - AKA the guys who maintain armour and do all the smart stuff back in the bunkers and whatever, not the guys who go out on missions. As I recall, attempts to modify power armour helmets to accommodate horns ultimately fail because of the armour's built-in regeneration talismans, which ""heal"" the hole, rendering any attempts fruitless. Attempting to do so might also damage the helmet in ways that are a bigger detriment in the long run, possibly. It seems to me that you'd either have to have the luck of finding a pre-war prototype made for unicorns, or have the luck of being born into a Steel Ranger chapter that has extremely talented scribes and access to the kinds of resources that can make/modify power armour. Just starting out with one though, like there's just unicorn helmets lying around or something, is approaching special snowflake/Mary Sue territory, as... certain fics have already done.  Aside from wearing a helmet that's not matched to the armour though, it seems like there's not really much of an option for unicorns to become soldiers.  Edit: I had an argument about this with someone just now, and I want to detail my thought process, if only for future reference:   We don't see any unicorn knights in the story. As far as I can find, there's only a throwaway line about horns and helmets: ""It occurred to me suddenly that Elder Cottage Cheese was the first… no, second unicorn I had seen amongst the Steel Rangers. Their helmets weren’t exactly designed for horns."" The implication here is that they can't modify their helmets to accommodate horns. The additional knowledge that the armour is self-repairing would imply that they can't modify their helmets because the helmets just undo the work.   The repair talisman seems like the primary obstacle to making a unicorn helmet. So why can't the Rangers just modify that to allow for a hole for the horn? Yet, we don't see anyone wearing a modified helmet (in the main fic). This leads me to think that:   They can't modify the talismans and armour because it's too complex for most of them. Talisman production by unicorns appears to be a lost art. Very few chapters have the resources or know-how to actually upgrade their equipment. If not a problem of know-how or resources, then one of practice/tradition - they simply won't modify their gear.   The lack of Rangers running around with modified/upgraded gear tells me that they're either ridiculously dogmatic about equipment maintenance and refuse to stray from the norm with modifications, or the average chapter knows enough to maintain the equipment but not enough to modify it. They're all running around with 200-year-old armour and guns, but in that time, nobody has thought to try to improve on it or fix any of its weaknesses? These are the most technologically advanced people in the wasteland, save for the Enclave - who also can't make more of the technology they're strongly dependent on.  Basically, nobody has been able to make a unicorn helmet because they can't, and they either lack the resources, knowledge, or motivation to overcome that obstacle."

falloutequestria,371qoq,WBRedcap,15,Sun May 24 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"Being an animator, and having worked in a large systematic volunteer organisation (that is to say, staffed a convention), I'm not surprised at all by any of this. This is a project being approached ass-backwards in every conceivable way. I think I was approached by Stable-Tec about a year ago and asked to contribute, and even then I saw that they were kind of heading for disaster. I'm going to say now what I thought I told them then (which evidently has not been listened to), though, a lot of it is exactly what you said. I think I also offered organisational help, but that just seemed to be ignored.  If this project is to see the light of day this side of the technological singularity, the following things NEED to happen.   The script needs drastic editing. The radio play has taken three years to cover three chapters. By my calculation, it'll be done in approximately 2066, and that's a radioplay, the least labour-intensive medium of adaptation after an audiobook. There are no two ways about it - entire story arcs, plot elements and characters (even party members) can be chucked or reduced in importance without hurting the overall plot or theme, and need to be if the damn thing is to even make it out of the scripting phase. In fact, the story would probably benefit from the removed clutter. There needs to be a style guide at the very least.  Voice actors are probably among the last people you should be hiring, and you can probably attract better ones with good samples to show off. Focussing on voice actors early in a project is a pretty rookie mistake. Also, if Stable-Tec's YouTube is anything to go by, the studio seems to be trapped in a demo cycle. There's lots of promotional material like interviews, convention appearances, April Fools specials, and lots of very flashy intro sequences, but only one animatic to show in terms of things that might conceivably be part of the end product, and if the whole thing is at the pace of that animatic, it's never going to see the light of day.   Additionally, from the sounds of it, a personnel overhaul seems to be required.   The writing ""department"" needs to be at most two people. The project needs to be lean and focussed if it's to survive. The art department should be doing style tests and setting up a pipeline for division of labour so that you have the same people on backgrounds, the same people on puppets, the same people on animation & compositing, and the same people on editing. Maybe they can be putting together test footage for the first episode. You should also have an art director whose job it is to have the vision for the look of the series, to pick and choose staff to achieve that look, and to impose that style firmly. Also, the art director should probably be fluent in English. The music & VA department... honestly, I know nothing about them. The work in the demos seems to be solid, at least. Definitely fire the head if he's going to act like a mob boss. Quality should always be ahead of loyalty and pride. Management: somebody just needs to shake the whole thing up and take charge, because it just sounds like an endemic management culture problem that things have been allowed to deteriorate this badly. Immediately fire anyone under 21, not for any legal reason, but because people that young just don't have enough laps around the sun to be in management."
falloutequestria,371qoq,CaptainHoers,7,Sun May 24 03:29:51 2015 UTC,"I think I was approached by Stable-Tec about a year ago and asked to contribute,   Oh hey, I think I was too... shortly after I posted that progress album of the FO:E trailer I was working on (which is dead in the water right now for several reasons)   here are no two ways about it - entire story arcs, plot elements and characters (even party members) can be chucked or reduced in importance   Pretty much.

falloutequestria,371qoq,E-Squid,2,Sun May 24 04:01:57 2015 UTC,although a lot of the side parts help build characters and their struggles that's not as hard to do in a cartoon as you can add that on through visuals and voices.

On the other hand, you're the guy who has been spewing nasty-spirited and poorly done Fo:E content after becoming a fanboy not of the story but of some blogger who hated the story.

falloutequestria,371qoq,Kkat_,11,Sun May 24 09:34:40 2015 UTC,"I've actually come to quite like the damn thing despite its flaws since then. It's gotten me to think about the Fallout games much more deeply than I otherwise would have, what made them such art in the first place, and what that says when brought into new contexts. I'm currently putting together another side story to give some of the characters I made their own identity instead of just existing to spoof the flaws of the original. (And god, the one I have is super first-drafty.)  I wouldn't say I'm a fanboy of anything. The term implies uncritical consumption, and that's just not me. Even Pannic's blog, I think, has a tendency to ramble off topic from time to time, sputter when it can't find anything to rip apart, and can go a long time without updates (the CGP Grey schedule doesn't work great on a blog covering something as lengthy as FoE and FoE side stories.) Despite my criticisms, I've found a lot to like about the story! I've played a lot of Fallout 3 over the last 6 months and the refreshed memory has given me a new appreciation for some parts of your story. Apart from anything else, the sheer sense of weight given to everything, and the way it's strung together. I completed The Pitt in one sitting (doing it at level 26 probably didn't help) and Andale was a quirky sideshow with no real choice or consequence. By comparison, Fillydelphia is this huuuge plot lynchpin and Arbu is a massive crisis. I'm still not hugely sold on the characters as they're commonly marketed, but looked at certain ways I can appreciate their arcs in ways more flattering than things like ""murder hobo"" and ""waste of space"". (A little how like if you ignore the main quest in Fallout 3, it's an immensely sad and cathartic game, and the hope-and-light filled main quest is a little out of place considering the broader context of Fallout).  So relax, I'm not out to get you. I'm not even out to needle you anymore. But I do think that people producing adaptations of Fallout Equestria are not going to get anywhere by being uncritical fanboys."

falloutequestria,371qoq,the4thaggie,2,Tue May 26 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"Critical does not mean ""this sucks"" in this context. I'm referring to being scrutinous and analytical, thinking about the work being adapted and the broader context in which it is presented.  If the studio has taken upon itself the task of making the best product it can, then it should be thinking hard about what will make the best product, what parts don't go well into animation, and more importantly, what the source material is trying to say - and not all media best present the same message in the exact same way. This is the ""spirit of the law"" adaptation. It's why Tom Bombadil didn't make it into the Lord of the Rings movies, and why like five hours of footage from the director's cut aren't in the theatrical release.  If they're trying to make the most faithful product they can (the ""letter of the law"" adaptation) then I guess you don't really need to think too hard about it. I feel like that would result in an adaptation that's not as good as it could be, by putting more grunt work into the production, and not serving the original work or its message as well as it could."

You look at all the 'negative' pokemon animations on Newgrounds and they're clearly all made for Pokemon FANS. Same for things like the .mov series or Cupcakes HD.  I can't speak for Hoers's opinions, but as an animator, I will tell you straight that they would nbot be enough to warrant that level of work- certainly not that PLUS the motivation to give advice to FoE project creators."

falloutequestria,371qoq,the4thaggie,3,Sun May 24 01:56:59 2015 UTC,honestly i don't see the project going anywhere even if it was organized. it's hard to say how many episodes you'd need exactly but given how long some of the chapters are i'd say about two per chapter (and that'd be streamlining things). that's about 90 episodes or close to three seasons. look how long it takes a full time staff to make 3 seasons using the same general style of animation . now let's assume that a group of volunteers can spend an 8th the time a full time payed professional can. that's going to take almost 24 years. 24 YEARS. that's not even remotely realistic as people working on the project will most definitely move on from the project or lose the drive to keep working on it as their interest wanes. all and i would put little to no eggs in this basket.   other large scale animated fan works ( such a journey of spark) have failed to finish repeatedly in the past. those who have succeeded have been of low quality or very limited run time ( see double rain boom)  the whole concept is totally unrealistic
falloutequestria,371qoq,codepony,2,Tue May 26 00:31:57 2015 UTC,I agree.  You'd be surprised by the amount of requests to animate full-length movies in SFM to some of the top animators.  Even our best can only put out a few minutes of top-notch animation in half a year.  Those who cut corners still can't make that much in a short amount of time without being awful.

I dug around a bit after I left the group and learned some interesting things about that: Apparently, Stable-Tec was initially conceived of as an actual business, that would pay the artists and actors as a sort of 'internship' for the real entertainment industry, I guess? A noble cause, but it didn't pan out, and the original director left. And a second. Then a third.  See, even though the business idea crumbled, the whole attitude of a strict corporate hierarchy never really went away. The directors still call themselves ""executives"" and get pretty dang angry if they feel you've challenged their authority. Even if the entire team agrees to make a positive change, the leaders will veto it if they don't like the idea, majority vote be damned.  We're segregated into different groups, so we have no clue what's going on in other departments. We're supposed to just accept it when we're told that we're making progress, even though we don't really see it (their argument was that we'd just mess everything up and try to hijack a design decision or something even though we weren't artists ourselves, and thus our opinions were worthless). Even on our forum, team members are locked out of all other sub-forums except their own department. So I couldn't track the team's progress on anything even if I wanted to. And when I brought this up to the directors and offered to condense all of our timelines and assets into a central spreadsheet, they went on a tangent and called me all sorts of nasty names.   The final straw came when their HR guy contacted me, and I learned just how dysfunctional the project truly is. That's also when I learned about the years-long history of the team, and this poor guy was so neurotic about coming clean, he immediately deleted his posts. All 74 of them. The more I find out about the leadership of this thing, the more unnerved I get."

I'd also specify ""An opponent's character's power at this card's problem until the end of the turn"".   I take it the idea is to confront the problem while the opponent is there, leaving them to regain power on their turn and either pay to move or force a faceoff, giving you a fresh problem bonus to claim and pumping Pip in the process?

I realize that free webspace isn't super easy to find these days, but there seem to a few that appear legitimate. This site -> https://neocities.org/, appears to be offering free web hosting. If you wanted to use that, I'd advise trying out the Javascript based wiki software I mentioned in the linked post. If you don't want to deal with the web you could try out WikidPad.  Edit: A quick Google search turned up http://www.zymic.com/ They claim to offer free web hosting with a fairly decent set of features, but you'd have to look into that yourself. Using their services would probably allow you to set up a PHP based wiki which would include several of the other options (see link at top). DokuWiki and PmWiki are (see link) are probably the best choices there since they used ordinary files (text) to store their data rather than a database.  I realize Google docs Does have a number of useful advantages, but it's link names don't help you tell what they point to or whether that doc is up to date. Regular file names usually contain more useful metadata. It can also be quite a pain to sift through a document that exceeds 10-20 pages whether it's on the web or otherwise. Internal links, if they work, can be helpful, but are a far cry from a wiki."

falloutequestria,36belb,Muffins117,3,Mon May 18 01:03:25 2015 UTC,Awwww yis. Here I was thinking that I'd have to wait for the Youtube release like before. I know what I'm listening to tomorrow.
falloutequestria,36belb,Harakou,4,Mon May 18 01:55:54 2015 UTC,"Same here, I somehow missed all the previous announcements for the new ep, and was only made aware of it from the covert art being posted on Derpibooru. I'm glad that I don't have to wait for the youtube version this time."
falloutequestria,36belb,Mark_Taiwan,3,Mon May 18 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well that was awesome, definitely the favorite of the 3 episodes so far for me."

falloutequestria,36beob,Risen_Warrior,11,Mon May 18 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"DAMN IT, NO. I was sad when she died, but I thought the whole scene was brilliantly done and that her death fit with the story. I thought that maybe Somber could finally let a main character die for good. The major death(s) in chapter 74 seemed to confirm it, but nooo...  Somber, why. You did a fantastic job killing her off, no need to undo all your hard work."

That's the one and only reason. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Anyway, part two of 75 (that's gonna be fun when we port this thing to FiMFiction...) is ready for you to dig into. Enjoy!"

falloutequestria,36beob,SomberPony,6,Mon May 18 06:21:23 2015 UTC,was she out of character?
falloutequestria,36beob,the4thaggie,6,Mon May 18 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"No.  She was so in character I wanted to shoot her myself.  There are times when she is too ""Fluttershy""."
falloutequestria,36beob,IcyShake,4,Mon May 18 14:59:32 2015 UTC,"It's possible she's been ramped up a bit, or because she's a cameo character we only see her when she's doing something big, which is where she comes off worst naturally. But a few chapters ago, I remarked about how bad she came across, and basically got the same response of ""and?"" before I realized that she's one of those characters where accurately depicting her and sliming her don't tend to look too different.  In contrast, I think that PH has actually done a little bit to rehabilitate Homage in my eyes."
falloutequestria,36beob,iIsMe95,2,Mon May 18 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh...maybe?  Something about the way you do Velvet always seems really Flanderized to me.

Not sure if happy or disappointed that Stygius' middle name is the same as one of my batpony OCs.  I totally called it back in the Tokomare chapter. I just knew that at some point Boo would make a dramatic entry carrying BJ's lost sword and it would be used on to break a Phoenix talisman.  I like the way that it took an Earthpony, Unicorn, Pegasus, Zebra and an Alicorn to deal with the Legate. Harmony ftw.   Scotch X Bastard... Filing that under Eynope, not thinking about it.  BJ with Luna's soul = not thinking about/dealing with problems 2  I've come to terms that it is likely that Glory really is alive (not discounting the possibility of a Somber double bluff though). I just hope that the 'how' isn't stupid."

falloutequestria,36beob,StarPupil,5,Mon May 18 14:32:48 2015 UTC,"Oh good grief, no. You don't think we'd end it there, do you? There's (probably) one last chapter after this one."
falloutequestria,36beob,fizzlefist,5,Mon May 18 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't read it, so I don't know how this chapter ends. I'm still on the boat. At least this one flies. And it spent less time there than Berserk. Yay."

falloutequestria,366brb,Unknownlight,3,Sat May 16 16:46:23 2015 UTC,The story is about a young buck who is forced out into the wasteland and experiences some strange phenomenons related to time. You can find the draft for chapter 1 Here
falloutequestria,366brb,tangotom,3,Sat May 16 19:02:14 2015 UTC,Looks great!  Can't wait to see this upcoming story... kappa
falloutequestria,36576f,E-Squid,5,Sat May 16 06:36:10 2015 UTC,What got you into writing? Did you face any obstacles early on? What motivates you to write?
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sat May 16 09:23:27 2015 UTC,"As I said below, after I read through the original and after reading through New Beginnings/Misfits, I really wanted to start developing content for this world, and using an alicorn definitely was where I wanted to be.  From there, I just started writing.  As far as any obstacles are concerned, my biggest obstacle early on was balancing Radiant Star's character.  Alicorns were highly viewed (and rightfully so) as OP and potential Mary Sues, so it was quite difficult to balance her so she didn't feel overdone.  Suffice to say, Star's growth as a character ended up being one of my favorite things about the story.  My primary motivation to write is, well, you guys.  I love every piece of commentary, every feedback, every little criticism (even if it's negative).  I do what I do for myself, for sure, but I do what I do for you fine folks who read my work."
falloutequestria,36576f,KrootLoops,5,Sat May 16 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"I was never sure you were aware of me at the time, but I always considered us rivals in the race to see who could finish their story first. Did you ever get the feeling that when we finally made it to the finish line there was no one waiting there to cheer and congratulate us?  I can't speak for Starlight, of course, but there does seem to be a bit of a dearth of congratulations for authors that do manage to accomplish such a monumental feat."
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,3,Sat May 16 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"I was aware of you, actually.  I'm actually slightly honored to have been considered in that fashion.  And I agree with your sentiment, it really did feel that way.  We finished, and that was kind of... it.  I had a minor congratulations thread, and then not much else.  Granted, my views and favorites are still fairly steady nearly a year later on FIMFic, and I truly love all of my readers regardless, so I can't really complain about it.  I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish, which was finishing Starlight.  But I do agree that those of us who are in the ""completed"" club do deserve some pats on the back.  Especially those of us in the ""over 500k"" club.  lol."
falloutequestria,36576f,KaiserVonIkapoc,4,Sat May 16 22:36:11 2015 UTC,What inspired you get into FO:E? What drove you make Starlight and its sidefic? And what's your opinion on butts?
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,4,Sat May 16 07:16:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I had seen the fic around a few places, and was starting to really get into reading MLP fics in general.  I'd always enjoyed the Fallout franchise in general, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  I was so impressed with it, to say the least.  From there, I dove into side fics, and the rest is history.  As far as Starlight is concerned, one of the things that I really enjoyed about the original was obviously the alicorns.  I'd read the only two other prominent alicorn fics at the time (New Beginnings and Misfits) and I really wanted to start my own fic with an alicorn.  Butts are big.  That is all."
falloutequestria,36576f,RoMSie,5,Sat May 16 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"Describe your writing process, your character-development process, and you plot creation? (do you come up with it all at first or you just see where the story takes you?)  Which book/fiction(pony or not) are you ashamed you haven't read it yet?  And would you rather fight one hundred breezie-sized Pride or one Pride-sized breezie?"
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sat May 16 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"Well, most of my writing generally takes place actually on my lunch at work these days, so it's sort of hit or miss these days.  When I was writing Starlight, I wrote most nights as well (hard to do now with a baby).  Character development for me is spent just brainstorming and coming up with character traits.  I am terrible at names, however, but I try as best as I can.  For Starlight, I came up with characters as the story took me, but I had the plot fully planned out a good chunk in.  Mending Hearts, I know where I'm going from the get go.  Book or fiction I'm ashamed I haven't read yet... hmmm... that's hard.  I can't really think of anything I'm ashamed I haven't read.  I am slightly ashamed that I read all of what exists of ""End of Ponies"" and that there isn't more of it.  :)  Also, one Pride-sized breezie.  At the very least there's only one of them."
falloutequestria,36576f,Wiregeek,3,Sat May 16 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"One hundred breezie-sized Greeds, now we're talking...   TK pinball anyone?"
falloutequestria,36576f,kidkolumbo,4,Sat May 16 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"Who are you IRL?  What's your editing process like?  Have you plotted out the entire series, or are you winging it?"
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,3,Sat May 16 14:39:01 2015 UTC,"Who am I?  I'm just a guy who writes ponyfic.  I have a wife and a beautiful baby girl of just over 7 months (who is sitting on the couch next to me as I write this).  My editing process generally starts when I finish a chapter.  I put it up on gdocs and forward it off to my editors/pre-readers Wirepony, Heartshine, and McMesser.  Then I spend time with generally Wire reading over and editing.  Once we're all on the same page with the chapter, I move to posting it.  As far as plot is concerned, when I started Starlight I had a general idea of where I wanted to go, but for the most part in the early chapters I was just winging it.  Once I knew where I wanted to be, I was more mindful of plotting things out ahead.  As the plot developed further, more things lined up with where I wanted to be.  With Starlight's pseudo-sequel, Mending Hearts, it's a little different.  I've got a master outline of everything that happens over the course of the story."
falloutequestria,36576f,Wiregeek,4,Sat May 16 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"During the reveal of the Vices, there was a minor furor about Starlight being a FMA rip. If that had been the case, what would the homunculus have been? Equnculus? Ponunculus?"
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sat May 16 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"Ponunculus?  I mean, probably sounds a bit better."
falloutequestria,36576f,RoMSie,3,Sat May 16 22:29:07 2015 UTC,Why have you used a Pegacorn in Starlight?
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sat May 16 22:38:43 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent question!  The character you are referring to, Lucky, is actually an OC that belongs to my wife.  My wife has been a fan of ponies and a collector for a very long time, prior to FIM ever even existing (so back to G1.  she has a large collection of G1 ponies, etc).  Lucky was her pony that she created a long long long time ago, before the concept of alicorns ever existed.  Thus, the concept of the pegacorn.  So, my wife had approached me about wanting to find a place for Lucky in Starlight (Of course, you don't say no to the wife!).  I thought about it, and decided that it was doable.  Originally, Lucky was meant to be a single chapter throwaway cameo, but I saw more potential in the character, and thus she continued to hang around.  Eventually, she gave me a good way to wrap up Discord and Twilight, and proved to be an all around fun character to write."
falloutequestria,36576f,TheDoctorHam,3,Sat May 16 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"What was your favorite scene of Starlight to write?  And if you could (or had to!) go back and change one thing, what would it be?"
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sun May 17 00:33:01 2015 UTC,"Mmmmm.... my favorite scene.  That's a great question.  I'd have to say probably the ending bits with Twilight and Star.  It was one of those scenes I had in mind the entire time I was writing, and it felt so good to finally put it down.  I won't spoil anything about it here, you'll have to go read it to find out for yourself!  If I had to back and change one thing, it would have been Greed's abilities.  Greed's character was fine, but his abilities made him a little too close for comfort to being a complete ripoff of Fullmetal Alchemist and the homunculi, that introducing the rest of the Vices really made it look like that's what I was doing.  Of course, my goal with the Vices had nothing to do with FMA (I tried very hard to distinguish this, especially with Lust/Lilith), but too many people definitely saw it that way.  If I could, I'd go back and really change him up, and make him more of a traditional raider king who's really strong.  Of course that would change up some of the bits in Chapter 6/7, but I feel like it would have been for the better."
falloutequestria,36576f,No_1ne,3,Sun May 17 01:35:26 2015 UTC,"Alright, super controversial question time. What FoE fic that you have read is your favourite?"
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sat May 16 18:03:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly?  I miss New Beginnings.  I really loved Aurora, and that fic was one of Starlight's spiritual inspirations.  But right now my current favorites are a huge toss-up between Heroes, Murky, and Hooves of Fate.  I'm really bad at picking just one thing to like."
falloutequestria,36576f,SomberPony,4,Sat May 16 22:31:06 2015 UTC,No pressure. :)
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sat May 16 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"Howdy folks!  I am loving the questions so far, so keep em coming through the evening!  And past tonight, if anyone has any further questions, please feel free to message me or whatnot!"
falloutequestria,36576f,Cylestea,2,Sat May 16 23:59:18 2015 UTC,about how long does it take you to do a chapter of a new fic you are working on?
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sun May 17 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"Too long it seems these days.  I am steadily working away on new stuff, just with my newish writing schedule, it's tough to have the time."
falloutequestria,36576f,JadedPony,2,Sun May 17 11:12:57 2015 UTC,"[spoilers!] Didn't your main character in Starlight have a shoot out in the middle of a town after robbing a bank and the towns people just let her go on about her way even though she had murdered a bunch of their towns people because her friend was being held hostage and she was forced to do it?   Is that the same fic I'm thinking of? The one with Spark inside her who changed to look like Twilight Sparkle in the coat?   If it's the story I'm thinking of, it seemed to be leading up to the main character becoming some really powerful being or the barer of the element of magic from the get-go.   I kind of lost interest in it and stopped reading some time after she got a prototype mini-gun and found out that she could give control over to Spark and become a nigh unstoppable killing machine.   Does that not bother you as a writer that your character is a unstopable-super-alicorn-element-baring-war-goddess? I mean, seriously, check the list, see how many apply:  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonMarySueTraits  This is the wasteland man, I don't care if they have your mother and your sister hostage if you come in my town and shoot up my people, when I have you at my mercy I'm putting you down, double tap to the head then I'm going after the bastard that sent you to kill us.   It's the wasteland, not old Equestria. People don't just let murderers go free because they have a good reason.    It was things like that, where you just skipped massive parts of the story, good parts that could have been interesting where we saw her have to face justice for what she did and win her way out of it through words or deeds, instead of just having the townsfolk be like, ""You killed our husbands and sons but it's cool, your girlfriend was in danger so we understand why you stole from us and murdered our people!""  which made me stop reading."
falloutequestria,36576f,volrathxp,2,Sun May 17 07:32:28 2015 UTC,"So first of all, the part you're probably thinking of is the scene in Far Hills with Greed.  So addressing that bit in that the ponies in that town were sort of instigating things by dressing up and acting like raiders to try and deter people away from their town.  Star did even try to talk to them first, and they shot at her.  In the heat of the moment, you're going to make a judgment call.  Does it bother me that my character is an alicorn?  Nope.  That was kind of the point from the get go that she would feel stronger than the average character, but offset by the fact that in the beginning, she's kind of a dimwit and a little bit of a complete ditz.  I feel like if you had gone on to read much further on, you would have seen and noted that Star's character growth is one of the best things about her.  She really comes into her own throughout the story.  It's also worth noting that even though she could give herself over to Spark, she didn't want to.  She wanted nothing more than to get rid of her.  And sure, there are a lot of little issues in the early chapters (i.e. 1-10) because I didn't pick up an editor until after those, and didn't have someone to smack me in the head and go ""No, don't do that.""  If I wanted to go and rewrite a bunch of that, I would, but I simply don't have the time.  Because yes, I agree that the town likely would not have been too keen on someone invading their space and killing some people, but at the time I was too focused on moving the plot forward to miss little opportunities like that, and I didn't want to end up side questing every other chapter.  I'm sorry that you stopped reading, however.  I know that my response here probably isn't enough to get you to pick it back up, and that's cool.  People have their opinions and their criticisms, and I take each one to keep moving forward and learn from them.  Thanks for the questions!  This was a good set to finish things out with."
falloutequestria,36576f,JadedPony,2,Sun May 17 11:28:19 2015 UTC,"Actually your response was enough to get me to go back and give it another read. However, I didn't mean just because she is an alicorn. I mean she was already one of the most powerful beings in the wastelands as an Alicorn and then you kicked it up a knotch by giving her a star metal spewing machine gun with virtually limitless ammo.   You kill the tension in the story if your main character is an unstoppable killing machine. It's like the old Superman TV show. They had to have Louis or Jimmy kidnapped all the time because Superman was so powerful there was very little anyone could actually do to harm him or even inconvenience him.   Being a Alicorn with a magical god-spark inside you and a limitless ammo weapon that shoots magically deadly bullets that kill you even if you just get a light flesh wound from the effects of star-metal is like you set the difficulty of a video game to ""Insanely Easy."" with an option to use God Mode when ever you want to. There is hardly any reason to play at that point. Likewise there is no tension in the story if your characters are one-pony armies."
falloutequestria,36576f,luckystar365,2,Mon May 18 04:23:18 2015 UTC,"Well you definitely live to your name, but that must mean you hardly like any fics since even the original has that fault at least once along the way..."
falloutequestria,36576f,JadedPony,2,Sun May 17 12:14:10 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Project Horizons until the last few chapters when the character went from hard to kill to living cyber-war-goddess. Now that shit is just so over the top it's abandoned all semblance of reason. It's pretty much just a masturbation fantasy for the author now.   I'm still enjoying FOE:Treasure Hunting. I'm just starting it but the characters literally start off so basic that I wanted to yell at them, ""NO! Don't go into the stables! Nothing good ever comes of stables!"" You see them grow as both characters and in mercenary skill/ability as they pick up armor, weapons and learn valuable life lessons in the wasteland.    Pink Eyes was good in a really goofy way. Murky Number 7 was great and the characters never got too overly powerful.   The key thing people seem to have a problem with is that HARMONY is the most powerful form of magic in Equestria, Friendship, not doing things on your own or becoming mutated/cybered/enhanced enough to be a one-pony war God. The whole point of the entire history of FO:E was that the world fell to shit when Harmony was lost. So why do people keep writing stories where ponies working together just vanishes when the going get's rough? That is why murky has been doing so well, it's about a little thing called friendship. Ponies working together to make the world a better place, not one pony being an all powerful bad-ass."
falloutequestria,362plw,0megaRidley,3,Fri May 15 16:26:29 2015 UTC,Stunning as usual.  I've been thinking of writing a series of short FoE one-shot fics (to try and get rid of the writer's block i have). I have now totally come up with an idea for one i will title: Steelboobs.

falloutequestria,35xb8o,director36,12,Thu May 14 08:03:47 2015 UTC,"my vote is hands down gonna be on fallout 4, even if the game isnt announced this year but they wait till next year.  mostly because from what you can see on their staff list, they have close to no programmers compared to how many artists and VA's they have.  so since the programming part is usually the longest part of making a game, i would say the fan game is gonna take a while to get out there, even if they go into crunch mode and get loads done every week.  i just don't see a small team of programmers like that making a game faster than bethesda and obsidians own teams."
falloutequestria,35xb8o,omutant,10,Thu May 14 11:25:37 2015 UTC,Also the fan game has basicly no funding where as Fallout 4 likely has a multimillion dollar budget.
falloutequestria,35xb8o,Arbiter329,6,Thu May 14 14:13:46 2015 UTC,"This is a good point! We wish we had budgets, but fan content = no revenue"
falloutequestria,35xb8o,JOrchestration,10,Thu May 14 16:34:46 2015 UTC,We actually have quite a few of almost every role (though we can always use more programming and UX people)   The issue is more that we can't work full time on our jobs despite how much we wish we could. Funding just isn't there since we can't profit from fan content.

While we have many dedicated folks, it is still a volunteer effort, so it will take more time than a fully funded studio.   That said, because our game takes more time, we should make more use of tech advancements and improvements in methodologies than a traditionally made game. Similarly, we have a lot of time to QA and proof our ideas, so it should make our game more clean than what's expected from a studio working to meet incredibly stringent publisher deadlines.  TL;Dr:  Fallout 4 first. FoE later, but it will still be solid and fun! :)"
falloutequestria,35xb8o,JOrchestration,3,Thu May 14 16:33:46 2015 UTC,Also this post was nothing against your team :) I was making a joke at Bethesda's expense because before the unofficial confirmation this game it had been almost 7 years (8 if you count they may not release this year) and you most likely being a fallout fan know that frustration especially with erik dellums making those tease tweets and survivor 2299
falloutequestria,35xb8o,0megaRidley,7,Thu May 14 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"Being a 2D artist at the Overmare Studios, I can confirm that, no matter when they announce Fallout 4, it will come out before our fan game.  We are still working hard to implement features, and so far there's little to no content in the game.

falloutequestria,35veen,Marioaddict,6,Wed May 13 21:34:46 2015 UTC,My guess is because copies of the first printing of FoE sell for so much on ebay and he is anticipating a similar thing to happen with Pink Eyes.

falloutequestria,35spbo,E-Squid,8,Wed May 13 06:08:13 2015 UTC,"If I can add something.  Not only should have have a plan for the events of the story, but you should have a plan for the thematic elements of your story too. Everything you read should have a strong central theme that ties everything together, something you can learn from the story or have described through the story. Having a central themeatic element that can apply throughout the story can make all the dangling little plot elements seem to come together to form a cohesive whole.  This doesn't mean your story can only be about one thing and one thing only, given the length of the story it makes sense there would be more than one message, but I would argue that while you can have multiple themes, there should be one that encompasses what your story is really about.  For example, I would argue that the Theme of the A Song Of Ice And Fire series (By GRRM, also known as Game of Thrones on TV) is that good men do not necessarily make good rulers, and that the nature of rule is hard compromise. I would argue this theme shows it many of the major plotlines (Eddard's, Dany's, Twyins, Tyrions, Robb Starks, Robert's, Jon Snow's ect) and ties the story together in a meaningful way."

falloutequestria,35spbo,Marioaddict,6,Wed May 13 13:10:13 2015 UTC,"I could go on at length with what I have observed, and while I may be repeating above, here's my ten quick bullet points I have seen work for people or experienced:  1 - Tell people your premise right at the start. Nothing turns off readers more than ""X is going to have an adventure!"" What IS that adventure? Why should I read your story? Your synopsis is the most important 50 words you will ever write. Keep it short, snappy and tell the premise clearly that offers a hint of what the goal is. (Finding mom, escaping Fillydelphia etc etc)  2 - Have a cover art before you launch your first chapter. Find an artist you feel will do it the way you need it and most importantly, you feel you can chat freely with. (I highly recommend MisterMech, Omega Ridley, Brisineo and Kalemon. All are very easy to talk to. If MN7 had two more acts to it, Kale and Bris are the guys I'd have gone to for act arts)  3 - Keep a blog updated on your progress. Even if only a couple people read it at first (likely your mates) it provides a foundation to build continued interest.  4 - Avoid drama. All of it. Forever. Speak politely, don't have enemies or call anyone out. Be modest, but don't deny your own confidence or achievements, all that does is cause people to think you're pity-seeking. Admit your mistakes and correct them openly. Don't try to 'cover it up.' People will respect you.  5 - If you can, keep to a schedule for the first parts of the story. This will never last if your story is long. It's simply impossible to write something to any rapid consistency once the scale ramps up, the quality has to rise and more elements must be drawn together. Not to mention you may find a job, have less time, move in with someone...whatever. Don't feel terrible that your output slows down into the latter half of a story. But if you've gotten to that point, people will know why. Stories get harder to write as they go on. But that initial burst with a schedule like clockwork will get people in the door.  6 - Don't try to retain them all. It won't happen. This isn't a tip about gaining readers, it's one about not going insane from worry over every change in statistics. Fluctuations happen. They come and go.  7 - Don't go harping your story out blatantly. A good way to get people noting it is to go ask for pre-readers publically. It gets a little notice and you're not just 'shilling' your story. You have a reason.  8 - Don't get too caught up in art requirements. It helps, but it's not something you can ever force. Gaining art isn't about popularity, nor is it about paying for more or constantly hoping. Getting art is by giving artists who read it something they want to draw. Spectacular vistas, iconic ""freeze frame"" moments you could see in a comic panel, iconography...these things speak to artists very visually when they read stories.  9 - If you start to notice an increase, find out where from. Trawl google with your story's name until you locate it, then engage with those people. Figure out WHY they started reading it and what's keeping them in. If you only ever ask about what's wrong/want only critique, you'll never figure out what your story's draw is.  10 - A little networking can go a long way. But you have to take the first step. Plug people's stories. Help them the way you'd like a little help yourself. Very often, this turns into a genuine friendship. Treasure that. Don't abuse it."

falloutequestria,35spbo,luckystar365,6,Wed May 13 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"Networking is a good one too. Make sure you contact other authors about their works, and get into discussions with them about both peoples' efforts. Showing enthusiasm for other people builds bridges that you can then use to cross to new markets (extended metaphor ftw).  It can also help you to pick up a reputation that the wider community knows you for (I'm currently known on 4chan for being a fan of Tofu's Outlaw character, Caltrop, but when I get referenced in that context it is sometimes followed by 'he writes Old Souls', which is nice)."
falloutequestria,35spbo,SomberPony,2,Wed May 13 09:36:23 2015 UTC,"Networking is definitely... tricky, I think. Maybe? Until recently, known people like authors and artists were distant fandom celebrities to me, and they felt distant, almost untouchable. Of course, I don't hold celebrities of any kind to be people up on a pedestal, far from it (in case this comes off as me saying ""oh wow they're such lofty people"") but for someone who doesn't find themselves already in a network, it can be really difficult to start building that, I think.  If I had tried to get an ""in"" two years ago, I wouldn't have known where to start, and I would've probably floundered; it seems like pure chance that I've met the people that I have. You might be right about those ways of building networks, though."

Have you ever been reading a magazine or article and suddenly come across a typo?  Remember how annoying it was?  Multiply that by a thousand and you get what many people feel when they read many FoE-fics.  I get that fan fiction is amateur writing, but there's only so much tolerance for mistake after mistake.  It makes it harder for the reader to trust that you know what you're doing and frustrates them to no end.  Two books I highly recommend reading more than once are ""Elements of Style"" by William Strunk and ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves"" by Lynne Truss.  They are short, easily accessible books that can help you out immensely.  Another asset is a vocabulary builder.  These vary from cheap to expensive, but they can help you broaden your literary tools.  The point isn't to use the fanciest words as often as possible, but to use all language, particularly middling words, well.  Does this help folks?"

And not just because I've contributed some code to it. :) It is capable of downloading and converting fanfiction from a huge number of different sites, including Fimfiction, and does a great job making epubs out of them. In the case of Fimfiction it doesn't use the native epub download at all, it gets the HTML directly from the viewable page and tidies it up. Also gets images.  Calibre's just great in general for this sort of thing. If you find stories in other formats it can convert them to epub too, most likely."

The main character has zero personality. She is a hired gun who kills people, she is a horrible lesbian who barely shows any emotion towards her lover and a worse mother figure who drags her child into constant danger and never even stops to check on the kid while killing people. HG is a video game character, going through the motions of being a hero but not actually being heroic. It's getting better in the latest chapters, she's starting to be more than an organic mobile gun aiming device and I think towards the end she will come out of her shell and become a good character but in the beginning she came across as a sociopath. Sociopaths don't really make for engaging protagonists. You have to read pretty deep into heroes to get any feeling for her personality at all.   For a long time I use to joke that she was Snake Plissken. She didn't give a fuck about your war or your president."

( a mare worth fighting for Is a tiny piece of the story and most people don't read it)   I think the real reason heros isn't as popular is because the first few chapters are rather slow and people stop reading it before it gets awesome.

I think it may be more a factor of the show's tendency to focus primarily on mare characters and not strictly because of cloppers, though. That said, the cloppers do tend to latch onto female characters with good aesthetic design. When you've got a male protagonist like I do or like Fuzzy does, you have to make up for it in other areas like writing quality and plot intrigue.

falloutequestria,35f1mq,istarian,3,Sun May 10 05:35:16 2015 UTC,It is rather painful to go back and read.  I thought it was rather refreshing to see a main character/narrator that isn't thinking about sex constantly.
falloutequestria,35f1mq,EuanB,2,Sun May 10 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair that is an aspect of pony life and one which a character is mostly likely to go without both because of reduced opportunities and intentionally for various reasons (health, security, etc). So it kind of stands to reason that it would be closer to the front of the mind when a semi-ideal opportunity present itself (or themself...). Also Littlepip has a bit of a fixation on Velvet for quite a while and does travel with her and Calamity (hard not to think about it when those two are going at it not that far away sometimes). Also, it probably doesn't occur often enough for most that those ponies become bored of it.    It's true that it's nice not to be experiencing the world through the sole lens of a one-track mind, but it's also true that the author should write things the way that character would see/think of them."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,E-Squid,2,Sun May 10 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Who is to say that Silver really isn't that way though.  Maybe she is asexual.    That actually makes sense to me, Silver is almost never the one to initiate intimacy.  However to be certain of that we would have to ask No 1ne."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,istarian,2,Mon May 11 01:11:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but as I said elsewhere, I wonder how much of that was up front deliberate character building and how much of it is simply a reflection of the author and what they are willing to write. That's a conscious choice of sorts, but it can lead to the impression that the character isn't really separate from the author and therefore is more of an pony shaped author protrusion than a character with their own semi-unique wants, needs, desires, or lack thereof.    I'm not trying to give the author a hard time per se, just pointing out how I see it."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,No_1ne,3,Mon May 11 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"You seem to be really pushing the idea that there is something wrong with the idea that maybe I don't want to write out sex. If you must know, no I don't like writing about sex, and I don't like reading about sex, and under no circumstances are you going to get a .5 chapter or something similar from me, and there's nothing wrong with that. But...   You are completely wrong to say Silver is a non-sexual being, and her lack of interest in sex is somehow tied into mine. It's stated multiple times she had an active love life with Wildfire, and this has been shown in flashbacks and dreams. Reference: Chapter 19, when she finds flare unconscious in The Facility.  She has shown a level of sexual attraction to two different mares currently living to different degrees. Reference: Chapter 1, Pearly, and Chapter 14, Platinum Haze.  She has even expressed interest in stallions on occasion, specifically the voice of Mr. New Haygas being described as sexy multiple times. Reference: It's like in fifteen places, gosh. Not to mention her reaction to a cute stallion in The Alehouse: Reference: Chapter 8.   She has also blushed, and shown to react to sexual jokes showing she isn't completely separate asexual, or doesn't react to sex. Reference: Chapter 9-8, the auto-cunnilingus joke, can't recall which one. Her entire backstory is centered around her losing the ones she loved, and trying to forget them and being unable. Wildfire was clearly her lover, as evidenced by a myriad of dreams and flashbacks and memories. Silver being unable to accept what happened to her drives most of the plot. Reference: Every chapter. This is not even mentioning the relationship between Hired Gun and Platinum Haze that has been blooming, and the plenty of evidence towards romantic and sexual attraction. Reference: Chapter 13 and 23 specifically, but many of other chapters to less focused degrees.   I am not sure how much of Heroes you read, or how long ago you read it. perhaps it was a while ago, and you have forgotten some and for that I wouldn't blame you, but as clearly evidenced there is no proof to the fact that Silver is not a sexual being, or that my very real lack of interest in sex is mimicked in Silver a character who couldn't be more dissimilar to me if she tried.  However, it is very true I don't dwell on sex nearly as much as PH, or even FoE. I cannot comment on Murky because I have yet to read far in it. I have nothing against the idea of characters having sex, (Flare and High Stakes were certainly good at it, and Hired walked in on Flare and that prostitute that one time) but the character we see the world through is simply not in a mindset to focus on it. If the world were written through Flare's eyes, or even Platinum Haze's, or Pearly's, or Wildfire's, this would be different to varying degrees.  The fact of the matter is when it comes to Silver is that she has only had one relationship in her entire life. Wildfire. A relationship that ended with her daughter and lover both dead. When she thinks of loves, or sex, her mind inevitably goes back to what she lost which is painful for her for fairly obvious reasons.   Much of her character is centered around trying to forget what happened, pretending it wasn't real to make the pain hurt less. But the past keeps coming back to haunt her. Part of this is seen in how she approaches matters of sex, to push it aside, or shunt it quickly because it reminds her too much, because it breaks her self imposed blockade.  But Silver is not a static character, she lives, she grows, and all that wonderful stuff. She has to accept what happened, and slowly she does, but that doesn't mean it hurts less, just that it's possible for her to live through the hurt. She initially avoided her attraction to Platinum Haze because she wasn't ready, because it brought back painful memories she couldn't accept or deal with and as she has learned to deal with them she has become closer to Haze. But Haze is not a passive creature, she saw through the memory spell what Silver went through, and she can emphasize with trauma. Haze is waiting for Silver to be ready, before making a move, because she knows that Silver still has a lot of healing left to be done.   As times grow dire, the scope of the story has been shortening. Before there could be weeks between chapters, now there is sometimes a day, sometimes a minute as things ramp up and plans intertwine. Simply put, where the story stands now there is no time for them to think about sex, it has been pushed aside for more important matters, this is not to say either character simply don't care about sex, just that the situation means they realize it's not as important as other things. This may continue to the end of the story, it may not, that is spoiler territory, but both characters are sexually interested in each other and just because I choose not to point out Silver looking at Haze's but the requisite 37 times a chapter, doesn't make that less true.  In conclusion, this essay I feel has proven a number of things. First, I have clearly and unambiguously stated I myself have little interest in sex, read or writing, yet through references provided from my story this is not true for my characters. These references have shown Silver is a sexual being, but with trauma laced within that sexuality which makes her reluctant to show it. As well I have shown many characters in the story are more open about their sexuality. I have also proved this by providing a detailed analysis of Silver's character growth and this ties into her sexuality. Yes all of this is a conscious choice by me, but it was not made because I didn't want to write about sex (Writing out sex I wont do, but I have no problems writing about it as proven with references above) but instead because it was a natural progression of Silver's personal journey. Contrary to your belief Silver's sexuality is heavily tied into who she is, perhaps I just disagree that I need to mention it constantly for people to accept that.  No One, Oooooout~  Edit: I wrote this pretty much as soon as I woke up, so if something is particularly incoherent, sorry."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,istarian,0,Mon May 11 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"That's not what I'm pointing out at all, simply that sometimes the character is less independent of the author and sometimes more so. I'm not asking for a "".5 chapter"". From what I recall though, and your comments, it is a reasonable inference to assume that were you a different person and you had essentially the same base character concept it is likely that what happens and what is mentioned would be different with regard to sex.  Thanks for the references, it has been a while. I don't see any 'clear evidence' that your own feelings/thoughts are not affecting the character. That is technically an impossibility even if it sometimes generally true. Whether she is truly similar to you or not is hardly something I can assess, much less prove in the positive or the negative.  Perhaps what I'm really getting at (and I'd probably need to re-read the story to be sure) is that what's going on in your head about the characters' thoughts/actions etc doesn't always translate onto the page. Thus what is a developing character in your head may be a set of unconnected and sudden changes in the character to the reader. What is a complex rationale in your head may translate to an apparent disinterest/lack of interest without a clear connection to that rationale.  I personally dislike, in principle, abrupt changes in the pace of a story. It makes it difficult to track what's happening and keep a cohesive understanding of the story's narrative. Thirty seven mentions of eye movement is probably excessive and would suggest the character has an eye condition, but if they glance at certain rear-ends with any regularity then failing to mention it on occasion would be an oversight. I don't mean accidental glances, I mean the external equivalent of navel gazing that is broken because of circumstances in a manner fortunate to characters who would prefer to keep certain sentiments to themselves.  You've certainly stated things, but whether you've 'proven' anything is really kind of debatable. I'll try to get around to reading the story again so I have a better sense, but I suspect that, as usual, the author's view/understand of the story is not the reader's view/understanding. How much it deviates is something that would require further assessment."

falloutequestria,35f1mq,Miniappolis,1 point,Sun May 24 10:04:09 2015 UTC,I was more using that term in a comparison role.  Littlepip and Blackjack almost constantly think about sex while Silver really doesn't think about it at all.  You are right though I used that term incorrectly
falloutequestria,35f1mq,TyrannisUmbra,1 point,Sun May 24 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"You could say that about more than just post-nuclear horses, but how much zombie apocalypse or Fallout or other general post-apocalyptic media do you see depicting survivors as ravenous horndogs?"
falloutequestria,35f1mq,CorvusProductions,1 point,Sun May 10 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"That's a pointless metric because they are going to avoid anything that would their game not accessible to the gaming market. Also, what's important to note here is that we're talking about a few characters at most, not all of post-apocalyptic Equestria.    There is also a difference between ""ravenous horndogs"" (of which I've yet to see any in any of the FoE stories except for perhaps the implied tendencies of 'raiders') and people who are a bit fixated. Further in a world in which the only certainties are pain and death, pleasure-seeking behavior (sex, consuming alcohol & drugs) is kind of to be expected.    Real world depictions tend to be limited in their details by our ideas about obscenity."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,GammaDK,2,Sun May 10 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"Or... maybe people just don't think about sex that much because they have other stuff on their mind, or their personalities just don't go there that much?  I can't speak for other examples, but Hired Gun doesn't think bout sex much because she rarely has time to as she tends to be busy losing body parts, and she just came off of a serious relationship that ended pretty poorly and it's the last thing she wants to think about as it leads to depressing stuff."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,KrootLoops,1 point,Sun May 10 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"That can be true, but post-apocalyptic scenarios tend to certain paradigms on their heads.    Well I'd have to go read your story again, but what the character does/doesn't think about is, to a degree, affected by what the author thinks/doesn't think about (chew on that for a bit...).    Frankly I can't see any reason for her to be so busy losing body parts, you'd think she enjoyed having limbs removed violently. It's also difficult in some stories to get a sense of the time frame (i.e. how much time has passed over the course of the story), which makes it difficult to tell whether a character is seriously bothered/traumatized/etc by a past relationship or if they simply haven't had enough time to properly cope/respond/recover etc with/to/from it.    Honestly Hired came off a bit stereo/arche-typed to me. Not necessarily cliched, but a bit stiff/rigid and unrealistic at times. Undeveloped as a character and too reliant on generalization, maybe? It's been a while since I read Heroes though."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,GammaDK,1 point,Sun May 10 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"avoid anything that would their game not accessible   You realize I said media, meaning everything like literature, comics, TV, etc., right?   Real world depictions tend to be limited in their details by our ideas about obscenity.   There's a difference between full-on depictions of sex and implied sex, and despite our society's apparent misgivings, media today gets away with a lot with just implications.   There is also a difference between ""ravenous horndogs"" and people who are a bit fixated.   Subjective; to some, they may well be one and the same. Regardless, I still don't see why it's relevant to the story in all cases."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,funtom5niper,2,Sun May 10 21:59:43 2015 UTC,"I thought it was rather refreshing to see a main character/narrator that isn't thinking about sex constantly.   You know why it's refreshing? Because that's what people have evolved to think about. It's human nature to think about sex.   If you don't want to include sex scenes in your work that's your prerogative but you'll be excluding something that the majority of the human race thinks is one of the key characteristics of a character's personality. You never need to describe the wet and messy parts of sex but if you emotionally neuter your characters you do a disservice to yourself as a writer by cutting out a large chunk of what makes a character who they are.   Real people have sex. Realistic characters have sexual impulses. Why alienate the majority of your readers to appease a few vocal prudes who think characters that act like real, living things, are icky? Even if you don't like sex scenes you can still have your characters be sexual beings. Just write them to the point they close the door to the room or turn out the lights, but removing sexuality in all it's forms only really works if you have a story that is exclusively from the point of a child like Pink Eyes.   Readers expect adults to act and think like adults."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,FafnerDeUrsine,2,Tue May 12 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"But that is exactly what No_1ne did with Silver/Hired.  While Blackjack and Littlepip seem to be constantly chasing somepony's tail, Hired really doesn't.    At the same time there are more than a few scenes in which Hired is horny, or actually does have sex, but those really aren't her driving motivations in the majority of scenes.  If I were to be more accurate, I should say that it is refreshing to see a character who doesn't bring up sex once a chapter."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,FafnerDeUrsine,2,Tue May 12 19:49:20 2015 UTC,"IIRC Silver has her fair share: Flashback mare friend (can't recall any names), drunken one night stand with the mare in the settlement she gets the kid from, drunken night of fun at casino (i think). Then of course she lands herself a sexy alicorn marefriend.  The reason i struggled to like it at first was because it started as too much of a New Vegas copy-paste. However the more i read the more i liked it. I've been meaning to go back to it as i got way behind on the updates and forgotten most of it.  Also i seem to have completely missed some things in Pink Eyes (if your theory is right)."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,Not_a_blimp,1 point,Sat May 9 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"the flashback i will concede, she didn't have a one night drunken stand, passed out before anything could happen.  and the drunken casino quest didn't end with anything.  She has also never banged the alicorn.  I didn't talk too much about pink eyes, as i have not read it myself.  got three chapters in and just found it boring."

falloutequestria,35f1mq,LimboSystem,2,Sat May 9 19:51:58 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, maybe but not sure. Heroes is a good story, but I suspect that it's all been done before. Pink Eyes and MN7 rule the feels world, FoE and PH rule the action and storytelling world. There just isn't much that's new in Heroes.   Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed reading the small amount that I have but I think it just has hard competition. Personally I enjoy a FoE sidefic that doesn't have a lesbian lead as most of them do for a reason I don't understand."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,AmethystWind,2,Sat May 9 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it'd be more because the story is about as 'vanilla' as you can get when it comes to FoE stories. PH and Murky are extremely grimdark, and Pink Eyes is pretty off the wall. Whenever I see someone asking for which stories to read, I always reccommend Heroes as ""As close to the feel of the original as you can get in a sidestory.""  It also has (had? Has it been fixed yet?) some pretty big issues with its early chapters regarding flow/sentence structure and generally doesn't feel like a polished story. It's something that would have turned me off of it if I didn't already know that it gets a lot better."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,AmethystWind,2,Mon May 11 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"I can't claim to be any sort of authority on the subject, not yet being caught up on any of the big 5 aside from FoE, but I disagree with your theory. Perhaps it has a little to do with the main character being perceived as less sexy or attractive as a love interest (or even as a friend) to the reader, but I think it has little to do with how much sexual content is actually in the story.  If I had to wager a guess, I would think it has more to do with character relatability. When reading both FoE, and PH, I noticed myself living vicariously through the actions of steadfast heroines, living the life I'd like to tell myself I'd live if I were thrust into the Equestrian wasteland. In MN7, I found a certain level of empathy and compassion for Murky. Despite never having been a slave, I feel like I could relate to some of his emotions. It feels just like when you have an outright awful day, except that day is your whole life. Of course I don't intend to say that I can understand the pain that Murky feels, but there's  a glimmer of something familiar in his experience. And PE appeals to the cute factor that makes us all love the pony genre in the first place. The main character's name is Puppy Smiles, for Christ sake.  Heroes, on the other hand, stands out because of it's main character. Silver is not traditionally cute. She isn't fun loving. She isn't quick witted, silver tongued, or carefree. She isn't how I as a reader would like to see myself in this setting. However, as I got farther into heroes I found myself loving her as a character more and more. Silver has a simple stoicism about her that is downright beautiful. It's subtle, so those readers who are simply in it for the easy escape may miss it. While reading Heroes, I've been reminded several times of my first time reading Blood Meridian, or a Clockwork Orange, where I found myself slowly beginning to care deeply for a character that I couldn't fully comprehend. I can think of moments in all of these stories that are stark, and dull, and brutal, and strikingly beautiful all at once. I just don't think that these are qualities that your average fan-fiction reader are looking for."
falloutequestria,35f1mq,No_1ne,1 point,Mon May 11 03:32:22 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling that heroes doesn't seem to be as popular amongst the artist community, but I think the active reader base is just as large as the other major fics!  Sure, it's probably not PH level popular, but I'm sure there's a ton of people still as infatuated with Hired as I am.  I've never read any of the stories for their 'clop' potential, and I love Hired being the 'mountain of a mare' type character because it really fits the story!  That being said, there is an astounding lack of art being done for Heroes, and on the Fo:E resource there's only seven pieces done for Flare (arguably the best gay pegasus ever).  While this is the case, I'm not so sure that having more clop or giving Hired a makeover would ever make the story 'more popular', rather I think it would piss people off because it would feel like No-One would be trying to pander to fans."

I kept reading because after Fo:E and PH, a story about a 'dumb' earth pony was a nice change.  I realized that Hired is so great because she literally has none of the standard stuff going for her!  She's not some smart and charismatic unicorn who know's how to get her way in the wasteland, and that's something that set Heroes apart for me.  Though, it's just my view on a topic that's subjective for everyone."

falloutequestria,35egih,Brisineo,4,Sun May 10 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"Oh that was a long time ago...  Can barely remember myself.  I remember seeing a lot of pony reaction images across the internet in late 2011, and thought it was just the next trendy show.  I didn't realize it was a kid's show, much less, MLP, until December of that year.  On Christmas Day, bored, and hearing people recommend it, I tried out the first two episodes.  I got caught watching it.  Shrugged that off.  Didn't really enjoy it much.  Let it be and left it for a while.  Yet I kept having this nagging feeling I need to watch more.  There was something there I needed to see.  And by Jan 31st, I watched the 3rd... Then the 4th.  5th, 6th, and before I knew it, I marathoned all of S1, and in the next couple days, caught up to S2.  And the rest is history.  Drawing, I actually had been doing for a long time since I was young, even to the point of attending a by-mail art school.  But by my teenage years, I had lost a lot of interest in art and stopped completely until ponies.  All the fan art inspired me, and I dusted off those old art instruction booklets and got to work, which I think, made the transition from no art at all, to experienced artist a LOT easier, since it helped with the most important thing: The basics."
falloutequestria,35egih,TheDoctorHam,6,Sun May 10 22:36:51 2015 UTC,"I got a question for ya:  What made you pick up Fallout Equestria, and what were your initial impressions?"
falloutequestria,35egih,Brisineo,6,Sat May 9 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I remember coming across Fallout Equestria first when it was still being updated and the chapters were announced on EQD.  Not being a fan of post-apocalypta at the time (I know, can you believe it?) I sort of ignored it as it finished and sort of faded into relative obscurity for a while.  However, people kept recommending it to me over and over and over again, and so to sate my curiosity, I took the plunge...  Initial impressions were kind of indescribable; I didn't grow up a gamer, so the RPG element that makes FOE's writing style quite unique was actually very new to me.  And the post-apocalypse ending, although also new and wasn't appealing at the time, seemed to be much lighter than I expected.  All in all, read the whole thing in about 6 days.  What a ride that was..."

Let's open the floodgates with the classics :   What was the piece of art you enjoyed working on the most ? Are there any pictures in your gallery that you're really proud of ? Who's your favorite artist, inside or outside the FoE community ? Biggest source of inspiration ? Do you squeeze the toothpaste tube at the beginning, the middle or the end ?"
falloutequestria,35egih,Brisineo,5,Sat May 9 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"Glad to see you, 0mega.  You actually inspired me to improve with my landscapes!  Art I enjoyed drawing the most... That's a toughie.  I'd have to say that F:OE cover with the Steel Ranger Helmet that I painted long ago... Just the procedure I had with drawing that felt so methodical, so therapeutic.  And the final result was very satisfying.  Ugh.  Makes me wish this new tablet worked with Sai so I could start making more stuff like that.  I'd have to say that I'm always most proud of my latest work, as I've actually tended to avoid looking back at my older stuff, considering how much I improve each time.  But I would have to say the one I ADMIRE looking back on the most would be the Nightmare Rarity Vector I did.  Every time I see it and all the things that wallpaper artists, musicians, and others have used it for makes me smile.  I'm really not sure.  I like a lot of artists in their own way, but hardly can't find one superior to the other because their styles are so different and so varying.  With so many strengths and weaknesses.  Uotapo makes me smile the most with their 2cute EQG drawings, Hussii makes for very inspiring work, Ziom05 I admire not for his standard works, surprisingly, but when he starts getting to simpler stuff, his way with brush strokes are inspiring.  PKX is another favorite, with how CLEAN his ponies are.  Ah, too many to choose from...  Same goes for inspiration.  I get it from everywhere.  Life.  People I meet.  What I read.  Even my dreams...  Well, actually, scratch that.  Blame my vivid, almost scarily coherent dreams and my wild mind for being a good majority of inspiration.

falloutequestria,35egih,Brisineo,3,Mon May 11 04:15:26 2015 UTC,"Simple art tutorials whether from professionals or online, a medium shade pencil, (I prefer having both a .5mm and .7mm mechanical because they're cheap and easy with a slight variation of line thickness) and a good eraser is all you need to start.  Before anything, START WITH THE BASICS.  Proportion, shape, and figure.  As I always say, a rough sketched, but proportional drawing is always more appealing than a detailed, shaded, but poorly proportioned one.  All the details added on are optional.  That's what the art school I went to taught me, anyways.  Teaching that good, detailed art is taken on more like a blueprint than a painting; measured, calculated, proportioned, and carefully drawn in the early stages to account for everything after.  Then after you're comfortable with the simple, traditional sketching, you can expand to other things.  Get creative and don't be afraid to try something new!  Oil painting, watercolors, ceramics, ink pens, markers, you name it.  Invest some money and buy a cheap tablet and experiment with the various drawing programs out there, like FireAlpaca.  You won't know what your preferred and best style is until you've tried it.  And if you ever feel disappointed in your work, don't ever let that stop you.  The ability to draw is more of an acquired skill than a talent in my honest opinion. (talent being either starting at a higher level and/or you gain an affinity for it at a faster pace) It's only limited by your imagination and dedication, and can be learned and taken on in several different ways.  Kinda like learning to play a musical instrument, really."

Again, thanks so much for the appreciation and really, I look forward to making more as soon as I get my tablet fully fixed with it's inability to use sai, for some strange reason...

He thought it was interesting for a while, and I helped him with the Pony stuff. He ended up giving up during ""Shadow of the Ministries"" because he felt like it was unimportant things strung together by action sequences that didn't affect anything on their own.  Here's some of the conversation we had about it (with introduction), my responses in bold:  (So a friend of mine has been on a Fallout binge lately. He's gone through 1, gave up 2 due to severe bugginess, and is now working on 3. He's also been reading a bunch of Fallout fanfic, and just started FoE, probably because he's been aware of it for a while via me, given he's never even watched the show.)    So I'm guessing the ""Living Goddess"" thing is something from the show?    So, are alicorns some kind of super powerful race in the show?  Well, the two that existed when this was being written were both over 1000 years old and moved the sun and moon.  Okay then.    Oh s**t! It's a Lone Wanderer/3Dog fic! Run away!    Fluttershy's a pegasus? I guess that makes sense given the name.    I just don't understand how ponies wear dresses.  See, the thing you have to understand is, children's toys.    Man, super mutants are a lot stronger in this one.    Durr. Steelhooves was a ghoul the entire time.    ""Am I really becoming that callous to the Wasteland?"" Yes. Just like everyone else.    Oh hey, they kept one of the names [of the mercenaries trapped on the roof: Butcher]. That's cute.    What the hell is an Ursa Minor? Oh, just a giant bear filled with stars? What happened to the yaoguai?    Nooo Steelhooves, don't do it!  What's he not supposed to do?  Unleash a bunch of zombies on Tenpony Tower. I mean, I guess I should find out why. It sounds like a personal problem.    Man, Velvet Remedy's a bitch!    So how long-lived are dragons?  Well, it was a plot point of an episode that they can sleep for over a hundred years.  Oh, so Spike could still be around.    Fluttershy killed us all!  Yeah, pretty much.  Oh well.    Oh look, dragon cave . . . called that s**t!    Okay, that's a little bull. ""I can't activate the Waters of Life because I don't have six ponies who are friends.""  It's a little more specific than that.  Yeah, I guess if you look at it as needing six sufficiently powerful mages, it's a perfectly cliche fantasy plot line.  And they each need to be aligned to a different thing.  Yeah, I guess I can buy that.    I'm kind of surprised earth ponies haven't died out. Just as an evolutionary thing. It seems like they're just way less capable than the other two species. Three? Two and a half.    Wait . . . Fluttershy is Harold?     The author's currently merging like six plot lines. You've got the Pit, parts of Fallout 1, I think the android ponies are based on Rivet City, unless there really is a Rivet City.    What the—Pinkie Pie can tell when someone's lying? That's a bullshit power.    Magic makes things stupid. I mean, Pinkie Pie can have a burning hoof and tell it's someone watching her in the future in a memory orb. What, does the burning come with instructions?   *It's from the show, an episode that ended with the message ""sometimes there are things you just can't explain, and you need to live with them."" *    Uh oh. Rarity's been dabbling in necromancy. It's a good thing Fallout already included Lovecraft, or this would be way out of left field. I mean, the black book of something unpronounceable, written by a crazed zebra being spoken to by the stars? That's right out of Lovecraft.    Why would two ponies volunteer to fight in the Pit if they like each other?  Huh?  Daffodil volunteers so Blood volunteers as well. I look forward to them fighting each other. . . . Ah, I see.    Ooh, it's zebra time.    I had not guessed that?  Huh?  The new perk. ""You're cool under fire, so you get more points in VATS. How much more? You guessed it: 20% more.""  Okay, that's an MLP meme  I should have expected that.    How are unicorns not OP in the Pit? I mean, the obvious answer is that they are, I just haven't got to that part yet.    I didn't know NP Cs can take perks. But it makes sense in this case so I'll allow it. (Xenith's paralyzing pull)    That raises a good question: why aren't all ponies dragon food? I mean, they're a lot more powerful. It seems like one is worth at least five ponies in high tech battle armor. They should control the world. Maybe they do, secretly. How would we know?    Bullshit!  What?  ""'I hope this is still going according to plan.' 'Yes,' I lied.""    Yay, Nuka-Cola bombs!    Now wait, the Doom Bunny? Is that something from MLP?  Well, Fluttershy has a rabbit, and he's an asshole, but it's a stretch.  I see.    Put a bypass spell on a healing megaspell and you've got a tool to heal everyone without messing up your battle. Seems like a good thing to have, especially if you finish the bypass spells a month before the end of the war.    DURR—who didn't see this coming? Except the protagonist?  What?  Red Eye would like the Goddess disposed of. Looks like another fetch quest. But then, pretty much every quest in Fallout is ""Go to a place, do a thing, come back,"" where ""do a thing"" is often killing someone or getting an object.    Well, I guess that's waht happens when you work with imperfect information.  What?  You get blindsided.    Man, these chapters are going to have to get a lot longer. (Given I'd told him it was about the length of LOTR and the cumulative length to that point.)"
falloutequestria,35c56o,IcyShake,19,Sat May 9 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"Part 2:  Yeah, it was a stupid plan  Which one?  Going to Pittsburgh. Hm. I should do that. And Mothership Zeta, but not Lookout Point. Maybe that should wait until after the main storyline. I am level 18, though, which puts me at over halfway to the level cap.    So it was a conspiracy.  What?  That the Lone Wander's companions never being mentioned by 3Dog.    Ooh. Mana potions. . . . What do you mean you don't want to be altered? You're taking the lesser route. Who does that? It's like taking ant sight over ant might.    Why is ""okie dokie lokie"" a thing?  It’s from the show.  Well I figured that, but why is it a thing there?  Because Pinkie Pie is a very silly character.  I see.    So what's the deal with Luna and Nightmare Moon?  <Tells the story, including how the stars aided in her escape.>  Okay, so the stars are evil.  It depends on what you're looking at. In the show, they never came up again. In this, maybe. Remember the pistol?  Right. Okay, so Luna is NMM?  Depends. In the show and comics, the Nightmare was definitely an external thing that later posessed Rarity.  But here it's easier to take the zebras' side.  Sure.    Sigh, time to kill the Brotherhood of Steel.    Uh, yeah, I took out all the Brotherhood Outcasts with an assault rifle.    They kept the name in place? That's interesting.  Which place?  Paladin Cross.    See, that's a really stupid thing to say: ""Gawd sent us.""    And this is where you get kicked out of the Vault.    What?! You don't get kicked out of the Vault? This is bullshit. I've come to expect certain things, and it's not Fallout if you don't get kicked out of the Vault.    Time to figure out if you're actually a control vault.    So they become the Outcasts. It's completely the opposite of the game, where the ones upholding the Oath are the bad guys. Completely backwards.    Haha gross. They're all inbred. Though I guess that isn't such a surprise. But I've heard you only need a population of about 200 sufficiently unrelated people, and I guess a breeding program.  Well, bear in mind it was heavily slanted towards the Apple family.  Yeah, I was just getting to that.  And there have always been some fandom jokes about the Apples already being inbred.  Are they?  No.    Bullshit. Why can't you be both zebra augmented and also a cyborg pony?    Man, this is the worst way to read a story. (The series of links to G Docs on EQD.)    Bullshit. What do you mean the Stables aren't set up to fail? Lies. Damn lies. Well, I guess maybe here, but in the games they were definitely set up to fail.    So how did Rarity get her cutie mark? Apparrently it's important?  <Tells story> So how was it relevant?  It probably has to do with how she was able to detect the stealthed zebra.  Oh, through the talisman?  <Nods>    So, it's got to be charisma.  What?  The rainbow dash figurine. I mean, what else would ""Awesome"" be?  Have you been tracking them?  No, they haven't said. So what is she?  Agility.  Oh, that makes sense.    They seem to do this a lot.  What?  ""You're being super bitchy today, so we're going away until the old you is back."" Does that work? I guess it does.  Who's being bitchy? Littlepip?  Twilight Sparkle.    Is killing joke really a thing?  Yes.    DURR. It's like there's only one in the Wasteland who can do anything. I guess it wouldn't make much of a game if that weren't the case, but really. ""You need a teddy bear found? Well, nobody but the Lone Wanderer could do that. Your best bet is just to wait around and hope he shows up.""    Congratulations, you've made FEV. Well done.    Heh heh. A telepathic psycho gestalt. That is . . .    Wait. Oh, she's level 30? Heh, max level. How did she only have two skills at 100% at level 29? I'm at only like level 17 and I think I have 4. Maybe she was spreading them widely, like among everything but energy weapons.  Or she has low INT, since it's directly correlated with skill points. My character's getting 18 per level with INT 9, so that could be it.  Given some of the decisions she's made—  Yeah, it makes perfect sense.    So, what is the killing joke? Is it a joke that, if you hear it, you die?  A plant.  Ah, so not that useful.  For what?  Killing a psychic conglomeration. I was trying to think of what would be a good way to do that, and came up with an idea that if you had it would kill you, a memetic basilisk.    Come on, how the fuck is Magic a virtue?  That is what I've been saying for YEARS.    Littlepip is being silly.    We've got to go back, Marty!  Back . . . to the future!  That's not true! That's impossible!  That mashup actually works pretty well.    Oh look, the deathclaws hate supermutants. Weird.    Um, just throwing this out there, DON'T TRY REASONING WITH THE DEATHCLAWS. It's not worth it. Even if it does work, the risk of it not working is prohibitive.    Aww, nobody can do a sonic rainbow? That's sad. Oh sorry, sonic rainboom. I don't know what that is.  For that, I'd just suggest Google. Get a video if you can.  It's 22 minutes long.  Okay, that's the full episode. Try for something shorter.  No, I think I've got it. So, what happens if you replace ""sonic"" with ""sanic""?  I dunno.  Yep, first result.    Oh look. The Enclave was trying to make slaves of the hellhounds. Surprise! Did they upgrade their intelligence too? No? Too bad. That would have been useful.    And a bonus: Oh, hey, what's your ringtone? I think I recognize it from somewhere.  You probably recognize it from my phone ringing before now.  Maybe. What is it?  The Rainbow Dash Stage Theme.  Yeah, think you were right."

I've seen occasional posts of Fallout-only fans giving the story a try and liking though. However, I know they miss a lot of the nuanced material or don't appreciate the content nearly as much as someone who knows the MLP side of the story. There's so much there and it's all interwoven elegantly.  However, a non-brony reading won't grasp the significance of seeing the past lives of the characters we know and love, they won't fully grasp the fall of beautiful Equestria, or the significance of the Sun and Moon, or the real power of friendship and the elements of Harmony. And that really makes me sad, because they're only experience a shadow of the actual adventure and story. :c"

falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,7,Sat May 9 05:31:25 2015 UTC,"Here is my first attempt at codifying a process according to what 2woToned has described plus a few other things not mentioned. I shall explain the liberties I took here:   A timeframe needs to be specified to ensure equal opportunity is given at each 3 month cycle From the close of nominations the 5 pre-readers have 24 days to read and review however many nominated fics there are which I think is a good enough time If there is a tie situation they both/all 'win' and get nominated If your fic got the spotlight last time it cant be nominated this time If your fic doesnt have cover art it cant be nominated If your fic hasnt updated in 3 months it cant be nominated If your fic somehow gets onto eqd some other way (for example how PH, FoE and Pinkeyes have) it cant be nominated The pre-readers need to vote preferentially, I know most people are most familiar with the American tick-one first past the post system but with such low numbers of voters it simply will not work here I chose Ranked Pairs because its a Condorcet Method which is the absolute gold standard in so far as elections science goes In the process I specified that the counting of votes would be done by a moderator, I also specified that the votes had to be posted minus any identifying information so that the pre-readers can up the red flag if anything fishy is going on and only the moderator will know who voted in any particular way I looked over EQD for what they usually do for highlighted stories and used that precedent to specify what we would have to provide to them in the end I give the mod/pre-readers 3 days between the outcome of the election and the sending of material to eqd and I give the guys at eqd 48 hours to get their end of things read for posting. I left in the regulations section even though as of yet I havent thought of anything that might need to go there.   Lemme know any issues or comments or alterations that should be made  edit: also imma head off to sleeps and shall be back in what I deem to be 'tomorrow'"
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,4,Sat May 9 16:15:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for doing this, it's very... professional. Very spot on with most of it, it only needs a few alterations. That is, unless you or anyone disagrees to these points:  A fic can be nominated in the monthly threads even if doesn't meet the standards of 'needs cover' and or 'hasn't updated'. It just won't pass on to the pre-reading phase, instead the next entry by vote will be submitted. This can allow an author to reconcile some of those problems before the pre-reading phase. I understand that isn't really fair, as a story the first month has two months to prepare vs. the other months, but I'd prefer the opportunity be offered to authors nonetheless. It also prevents myself and other moderators from having to comb through and trim continuously.  The pre-reader sign ups were originally a two-three day process at the beginning of the deciding month before random selection. With too many overlaying events related to just EQD voting I'm afraid that people will think of this sub as 'that place that votes on FOE stories, and other things happen occasionally'.  I'd like the Pre-reading team to come to a conclusion in whatever way they feel comfortable. This can change to a voting system if problems with group coordination should arise. I don't know if EQD needs star-ratings on submissions to meet their standards and practices. If so, then we'll have to come up with some method of quantifying FOE sidefic quality."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,3,Sat May 9 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"regarding your last point my feeling is that there should be a procedure laid down to decide the choosing rather than relying on a jury-type decision for the following reasons (mostly to do with the extremely low numbers of voices to the relatively high number of choices):   With 5 pre-readers it is very easy to get into a situation where all the candidate stories are equally liked- all it takes is 2 tied monthly threads or one 3-way tie and suddenly we have 5 pre-readers and 5 stories with the possibility of no 2 pre-readers agreeing on which is best. Deliberating can take time and even fail entirely to resolve and can sprout arguments or attempts by pre-readers to influence each other to begrudging consensus. With a codified preferential rating system at pre-readers are encouraged to abandon strategic voting or compromising and to just honestly rank what they have seen in order of their preference, making the arrangement safe against the spoiler effect and arguments.  Ranked voting systems differ from the American FPTP system in that they strive to arrive at the winner that makes the most electors happy, and if each pre-reader is ranking the n-number of stories in their order of preference its a lot more information than them just picking a favorite to champion for in council. Thats not to say that the method I chose isnt the only one, theres instant runoff voting and its opposite the coombs method, approval voting, score based borda count voting, and majority judgement voting. But these all have the issue of nuance when it comes to very small numbers of votes as we have here.   CGP Grey does a heap of excellent videos explaining how ranked voting systems achieve better outcomes. But my main reason for advocating a codified system is that with so few voters to so many choices we cant rely on their being a clear majority consensus on which story gets sent to eqd. If it were more like 15 pre-readers to 3-6 fics then that would be much more managable, barring any polarising matchups.  That said I have made changes and versioned up and here is the amended Spotlight Act for critique  I'll keep checking in to see how the community wants to nut out the gritty on deciding on the winner, but I think its better if pre-readers dont have to try and change each other's minds to get to a winner."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,3,Sun May 10 06:51:13 2015 UTC,"As an aside I have prepared an Electoral automation engine for this whereupon the moderator need only type in the names of the candidate works and then transcribe the votes from the pre-readers. The result is automatically worked out and can be screengrabbed.  It all works in excel and is compatible all the way back to '97 and can be played with here  (I had the engine already and just fine-tuned it, I also have an Instant Runoff, a Coombs, and a bunch of Borda counts)"
falloutequestria,35bqmm,SevenCell,4,Mon May 11 14:03:56 2015 UTC,"Well, that is certainly above and beyond what I could have hoped for. Thank you again for doing this. I hope you don't mind, but while the pre-reader voting system can stay, I'm thinking on their votes being made public upon final decision.   My reasoning is to prevent suspicion. Imagine if, for example, Tofu signed up for pre-readership. His story was a monthly top spot, and passed as the pre-readers selection to go on to EQD. Some people would wonder whether or not the choice was fairly made. If it was shown that he voted for another fic then any doubts could be cast down.  Similarly it also prevents suspicion that myself or other moderators taking up the votes simply adjusted the numbers."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,3,Mon May 11 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"That's fair, and a simple enough change to make, the moderator would just have to enter in the names of the pre-readers where the 1-8 numbers presently are.  I am neutral on the idea of secret ballot vs public ballot, on the one hand it makes everything superduper transparent, it also opens up the voters to reprisals by 3rd parties for 'not voting the right way'.  But who gets to be a voter is luck of the draw, I'd hope our community wouldn't go nuts on anyone based on how they vote.  I'm away from my computer today but will make those changes when I get home."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,volrathxp,3,Mon May 11 23:48:12 2015 UTC,"It's a situation of damned if you do, damned if you don't. Eventually someone is probably going to take the voting process too seriously. I'm hoping that any pre-readers understand what it means to have their name displayed. I'm really hoping that nobody is so uncaring and disjointed that they feel it appropriate to send pre-readers angry and/or harassing notes.   Quite depressing, but them's the facts of life."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,4,Tue May 12 02:10:58 2015 UTC,"If it matters, I'm in favour of public ballot. It's easier for trolls and more damaging to the community as a whole to cry conspiracy than to take issue with personal choice - with a totally transparent system, sure there might be one-to-one spats and disagreements, but the framework is still indisputably legitimate and neutral.  Hell, maybe let the prereaders voluntarily justify their choices on their ballot. Give feedback, compare stories, provoke discussion."

Then I discovered I couldn't get a job (not even a minimum wage one) for a year until I finally got one doing fabrication drawings and interior design for a small (now defunct) design firm for 2 years. Then there was another year of terminal unemployment and then I got the job at the electoral commission basically because they needed a quick replacement for the girl who was doing incredibly bad graphics for the upcoming election staff manuals. I was hired as 'administration assistant' and basically only got the job because I had software proficiency in Indesign soooo heh, a life of design takes one on a wildly unpredictable journey."

falloutequestria,35bqmm,volrathxp,5,Sun May 10 07:18:57 2015 UTC,"I have high hopes for this one, a worrying number of senior personnel are in the 'may not stay around for the next election' level of being over it, which means there is a desperate need for succession plans and I have done very well in picking up what my senior has gone through in my time there. That and I get a lot of praise for my clueyness, they are used to a technical expertise level of intermediate Word use so its easy to stand out."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,volrathxp,5,Sun May 10 07:28:02 2015 UTC,"I know this feedback won't be entirely helpful, but I'm completely on board with the system as presented."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,LoneWolfMark,5,Fri May 8 20:40:02 2015 UTC,I agree. It sounds good to me.
falloutequestria,35bqmm,E-Squid,6,Sat May 9 03:52:48 2015 UTC,"I like the ideas behind this, I am still slightly concerned about the vats of taint.  In all seriousness, this is all very good.  I would like to note that somewhere there should be some heavy transparency concerning quality.  Are we expecting that fics nominated for this would have to adhere to the same level of insane quality that EQD requires through their normal pre-reading process?  (I've seen this firsthand, which is why I ask)  Lastly, so as to avoid said vats of taint, I cannot really do any pre-reading sadly, as much as I would love to.  Work on my own pieces of the Wasteland + life with a 7 month old kind of take a lot of my time.  I wish good luck to the pre-reader groups, just... don't die."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,3,Sun May 10 02:09:27 2015 UTC,The issue of quality is left up to the community and the pre-readers. You could say the reason for all this is just to ensure the quality of the story sent to EQD. Any oversight guaranteeing quality is also likely to be seen as manipulation.  One of the reasons to have the pre-readers selected before each event is to make sure that they can devote the time to sort though 3-6 stories in just under a month. It ain't gonna be easy.
falloutequestria,35bqmm,E-Squid,4,Sun May 10 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"Cool cool.  Again, I only wondered because I've witnessed firsthand the kind of quality that EQD requires through their normal process (quality standards that as Dimestream had put it to me ""If I was paying you money to do this, then I would make these kinds of comments"").  Erm... wow, 3-6 stories in under a month.  Sounds... fun.  Thank Celestia... err, Luna, for those vats of taint."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,6,Mon May 11 10:52:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a plan to me 2woToned!  And I'd be happy to help in any way possible.  Oh, and I'm calling 'not it' for the job of cleaning up the dissolved pre-readers. That stuff's nasty."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,ErthiloV2,5,Sat May 9 02:43:09 2015 UTC,This is a little confusing... do you mean that EQD will be referring to this subreddit for which stories they feature?
falloutequestria,35bqmm,sk2150ad,5,Sun May 10 05:04:05 2015 UTC,"As I have understood EQD will post a FoE sidefic spotlight every 3 months but we  have to do all the work in deciding which they will post, basically they are giving us a blank spot and we have fill it with no input or help from them (because icky icky FoE, or something)"
falloutequestria,35bqmm,Hnetu,4,Sun May 10 07:56:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, right. I'm guessing that was what was discussed in the other thread. Like I said before, it seems easily abusable by people brigading or even just attracting a certain kind of people... but I'm sure you guys can work that out."
falloutequestria,35bqmm,ErthiloV2,3,Sun May 10 08:03:32 2015 UTC,"The open (reddit vote) stage would be susceptible to vote brigading as anything else on reddit, but it would only be useful to ensure a particular fic is up for the pre-readers to read, brigading the same fic in every thread wouldnt hurt anyone because said fic only gets in once and theres still the other 2 fics it has to compete with to actually get chosen for eqd.  in the end the final decision is between the 5 pre-readers as to which of the 3 fics gets sent to eqd so I think the abusability is low"
falloutequestria,35bqmm,Marioaddict,3,Sun May 10 09:06:39 2015 UTC,"Sound like a good idea to me. But what about things that aren't necessarily fics?   Say, a comic for example!"
falloutequestria,35bqmm,Marioaddict,6,Sun May 10 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm, stablequest is an interesting entity when it comes to this kind of thing. It follows most of the guidelines discussed, just isn't the same medium. The problem is if EQD would be willing to spotlight it. I'll have to ask, I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you right now though."

falloutequestria,359abd,Coruscare,4,Sun May 10 06:55:51 2015 UTC,Honestly it really annoys me that Pink Eyes of all stories gets wonderful chapter artwork but the second printing of Fallout: Equestria itself was rushed and missing basic content features such as the already established artwork. :/
falloutequestria,359abd,NEREVAR117,6,Fri May 8 09:09:55 2015 UTC,"While I'm sure it doesn't make it up to you, the one thing I really like about the second printing having almost no chapter artwork is that it makes the one, singular piece of chapter art in the book much more impactful than it otherwise would be."
falloutequestria,359abd,Unknownlight,3,Fri May 8 15:17:22 2015 UTC,I haven't (re)read the story using my books yet. Where was this chapter art piece?

falloutequestria,359abd,Unknownlight,3,Fri May 8 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"That's partly because some of the original art files couldn't be found, and partly because the files that were scraped together simply were not print ready."

falloutequestria,3589kb,CorvusProductions,3,Fri May 8 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"This I can see as interesting, though I'd like to know more technical aspects of what's going on dev-side. The Overmare Studio's project had initially started out as a GECK-based mod, so seeing that idea taken to it's completion (although not in the same direction) is exciting. The trailer is obviously to drum up support, though I'm interested to see the implementation of pony in this game. What I'm asking is if you're going to be using pony models for NPCs or just ponified human characters.  It appears as though you've just recently set up and have a lot of drive towards finishing this goal. That's good, keep that motivation going and I believe you can make it quite far. Just be sure to keep the project as on-track and in-scope as possible, it's easy to derail. I look forward to future updates."
falloutequestria,3589kb,TyrannisUmbra,3,Fri May 8 03:26:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually know that Overmare started with GECK. I was always under that impression until I realized they were running off of Unity3D. We actually have no association with Overmare (though I'd dearly love to collaborate with them!).   The Manehattan Project is working solely in GECK. We are very fortunate that our Lead Scripting Engineer Red Kat is an immensely talented and tremendously experienced GECK scripter (and is quite skilled a heck of a lot of other areas). So far, she hasn't shot down any of my crazy ideas. ^  As for the GoE races, this is set in the human world that's been partially merged with the Equestrian Wasteland, so the characters will be human...for the most part. (However, we will not be doing any playable anthro/pony characters at launch, though it will be compatible with the existing anthro mods out there) We're playing with the idea of a ""Pony"" DLC and have already secured permission to use the Pony models used in the well-known Skyrim Mod.   That being said, humans aren't the only sentient beings in play here (and I'm not hinting about known Fallout races). There's a much larger story at work here. :)  Finally, thank you for your last comments. You can actually a partial history of how the Manehattan Project came to be at Here. I've already learned just how hard a collaboration can be...but I tend to be a bit on the stubborn side. This'll happen, one way or another. :D"

falloutequestria,356yeb,ArgonGlow,5,Thu May 7 16:56:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like story time! What's going on here?
falloutequestria,356yeb,ArgonGlow,3,Thu May 7 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"All right, I'll do my best to explain the depicted event, but be warned, it gets complicated.  In the blue jumpsuit we have Enigma, 24 years old, who at the age of 18 was ""chronoported"" from his home, Omega, 1000 years into the past into Stable Fifty, which is around the time of the Equestrian Wasteland today. (Omega = what became of Stable Fifty in the far future) (Chronoported = teleported, but through time)  After being interrogated by the residents of Stable Fifty, he was deemed non-threatening and was given a green jumpsuit and made a citizen of the Stable. Green jumpsuits are normally reserved for foals who have not been given a job in the Stable yet. (Stable Fifty has color coded jumpsuits as part of their experiment)  Over the next six years, Enigma became a Maintenance Technician and was given a regular old blue jumpsuit. He also developed a relationship with a mare during this time period, but she died of a genetic heart condition shortly before their wedding.  Enigma became distraught at her death, and became determined to do anything if it meant he could spend more time with her. He decided the best way to do this was to try and rebuild the ""Chronoportal"" that sent him to this time period. He convinced the other residents of Stable Fifty to help him build it, saying that they would be able to open a ""trade route"" with the future, where everything in Equestria is better! (Spoilers: It isn't)  After finishing construction, he gathers the citizens of Stable Fifty around the Chronoportal and activates it, [DATA EXPUNGED], then sets it to take him to the day he first arrived in Stable Fifty.  Depicted Scene: Enigma (24, Blue Jumpsuit) sneaks up on Enigma (18, Green Jumpsuit, this is the character I'm playing as in our pen&paper RPG), and uses a taser to stun his past self. Enigma (24) realizes that he shouldn't kill his past self, so he opens the door to Stable Fifty and kicks out Enigma (18) into the Equestrian Wasteland.  Enigma (18) is very confused at what just happened, stumbles throughout the Equestrian Wasteland for a few days and miraculously isn't killed, then meets a pony who becomes his friend... and then adventures happen!  Enigma (24) convinces the residents of Stable Fifty that he is, in fact, not suddenly older than he was when they last saw ""him,"" and he starts to relive the life he had. Unfortunately, his former marefriend at this point in time is actually nine years younger than him (instead of just three years from his previous timeline), so she rejects his every advance. He becomes extremely bitter at her. He conspires to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Though when you mess with your own past... time is bound to catch up with you. That's when the really complex stuff happens!  There are a ton of things that happen after this, but the wall of text would be about quadruple what I have above if I were to explain it all. :P  So, that's basically the context behind this scene. I have a side-story in the works based upon this and the rest of our group's adventures, but progress is really slow because I'm very inconsistent with writing."

falloutequestria,354th7,yetanotherpony,7,Thu May 7 02:48:29 2015 UTC,What really gets me into a story is when the story seems at least well edited. A story that has poor english is a huge turn off to me.
falloutequestria,354th7,LunaluxUmbrus,3,Thu May 7 03:15:58 2015 UTC,This. This so much. My immersion and interest are lost when a story has a lot of typos in it.
falloutequestria,354th7,OlimarandLouie,6,Thu May 7 06:28:50 2015 UTC,"Regular/consistent updates is a big draw for me.  Recommendations can really help me stick with a story. The one i'm currently reading would have been dropped after the first few chapters, but because it was recommended to me I stuck with it and it got better.  Over use of memes and non-relevant out of world references has become a turn off. If done right they can be good and add to the experience, but a lot of the time they break immersion.  What i call the 'Oh yeah, plot right?' disease. I love a good romp around the wasteland story like the next guy. However if the story has gone on for several chapters without any hint that there is an overall plot, then i will grow bored and likely drop it."
falloutequestria,354th7,finalsight618,3,Thu May 7 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"I certainly hear you with the memes and references. I'm curious, how often is frequent enough for updates?"
falloutequestria,354th7,Xypher_cha,2,Thu May 7 17:35:57 2015 UTC,In the beginning it needs to be fast enough that people won't have forgotten about it by the next chapter.  A month to a week Is a good measure I think.  Later on though people will generally wait longer if it's hooked them well enough
falloutequestria,354th7,Marioaddict,8,Sat May 9 03:00:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there's one single deciding factor that determines whether or not I read a new story: Whether or not it's complete.  All the recommendations, cover arts, characters, grammer, and reviews mean nothing to me... Sure, that all helps me pick ones to potentially read, but if I'm going to read it, I personally want the story to be completed. If it's not finished, then I'm not reading it, no matter how long or how good. No exceptions.  On that note, thank god some of the big ones are ending soon. I can finally start reading them once they're done!"
falloutequestria,354th7,volrathxp,3,Thu May 7 04:25:06 2015 UTC,"Semicolons!  (Sorry, had to).  For me, I like recommendations.  So, seeing someone recommend a new story really makes me consider picking it up.  From there, it's whether or not the story's plot and characters are engaging enough to keep me reading."
falloutequestria,354th7,AmethystWind,3,Thu May 7 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's how I got into my favourites list as keepers, and how I started-and-stopped reading a fair few more.  I try to give any fic a chance, provided the blurb can peak my interest. Mostly it'll be mechanical issues which make me stop reading a story, rather than the plot (though not always). Generally, if a story is properly proofread, and has good pacing, I'll keep with it."
falloutequestria,354th7,sk2150ad,3,Thu May 7 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"An early impression is what I think I need, I need to know that its going somewhere with ponies I want to go with.  I think good recommendations and a general gist of the story is what would make me pick it up, not vague though, I need to know more than just the general setting.   I think the first chapter needs to be intimate, more about character building than world building. I need to feel for the character im traversing the world with before I will get excited for the world around them if that makes sense."
falloutequestria,354th7,IcyShake,3,Thu May 7 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"I tend to get most stories I read, both within FoE and without, via either recommendations or because they are written by an author I am already a fan of. My criteria to read something in a timely fashion look something like this: a strong recommendation from someone I trust (or it being written by an author I like); a premise that doesn't turn me away; 20k - 30k words so far, better yet 15k - 20k (or less if it's a one-shot, but I'd probably want at least 2-3 chapters done or a previous record of following through on long stories for one that's incomplete). That's what I tend to want to give something a chance. There's plenty that will turn me away after that point, but that's a whole other conversation and much more subjective and nebulous."
falloutequestria,354th7,the4thaggie,2,Fri May 8 00:44:35 2015 UTC,"I classify stories into two different categories:  Completed and Incomplete.  I am more lenient on complete stories because I can knock them out.  With incomplete, I have to either keep notes or everything in my head so when a new chapter comes out I am still immersed.  The top areas that both bring me and keep me in a story are:   Atleast monthly or bi-monthly updates World building/wartime expansion Dynamic characters who can be equally as happy as sad or as mature as immature. A good balance of narration and dialog. Epic (hard to describe)   I particularly like anti-hero and heroes who struggle with their own good vs. evil.  I have a huge focus on regularity (posting) and characters themselves.    In many ways, stories compete for our limited attention.  It's not just a question about what would make you read the story.  It's also about what makes a story stand out from the rest to fit within your capacity to read.    For instance, I may only have one moment a week to sit down and read with everything else going on.  Others may be able to read alot and often.  It also not necessarily about length.  When I find fics on Fimfic to read, I gravitate to the 50k+ words stories.  I LOVE a long story.  Unlike a movie, I can't just watch it once and be done.  If I am going to get immersed in a story, short stories will let me down faster than longer ones by the very nature of length.  I took the end of FoE (Kkat) very hard."
falloutequestria,354th7,LunaticSongXIV,2,Thu May 7 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"There's a lot things I look for in any fic.  The most important part is completeness.  If a fic is finished, I'll likely give it a shot, even if it violates everything else on my list.  Why?  Because often times the little things that bug me only bug me until I'm immersed.  If I can sit down and read for several hours at a time, it's easier to gloss over the things that bug me, because I'm already sucked in.  If I have to re-immerse myself every chapter because I'm riding the coattails of the updates, these things bug me more.  Of course, nothing can save a fic from my trash bin if you have major transgressions.  So what are those things I'm looking for?   Spelling   There's no excuse.  Run a spell check, it's literally a function of almost every word processor in existence.  But use your spell check intelligently -- re-read any sentence after it is checked to make sure you have the right word.  There's little worse than spell checking something and then picking the wrong suggested correction.   Word Choice:  Repetition   While repetition can help characterize the speech patterns of a character, repeating specific descriptions and phrases outside of speech is distracting.  There are several authors on Fimfiction that seem to be obsessed with the phrase 'her ears splayed back' or variations on it.  When I read this description five times in one chapter, it is jarring.  Some authors (myself included) also have pet words they tend to overuse without realizing it.  Be aware of your habits.   Word Choice:  Vocabulary   Make sure you actually know what the words you are using mean.  There are many cases of authors repeatedly using words incorrectly, and the worst part is that no one calls them out on it.  The worst common offender is probably the word 'bemused', which many people think means the same as 'amused'.  It doesn't, and in fact means something almost completely opposite - a bemused look is one of confusion.   Grammar and Structure   I don't expect perfection; hell, I'm not perfect myself.  But if you don't know how to use an apostrophe correctly (here's a hint:  an apostrophe doesn't mean watch out, here comes an s!), or if you constantly have run-on sentences or sentence fragments, it starts to break down the meaning of your actual words.  Similarly, know when to insert a paragraph break.   Pacing   If I've been reading for an hour, nothing significant has happened, and I still have no idea where the plot is going, I'm probably not going to keep reading.  You don't need to telegraph the entire plot, you just need to give your characters a direction to set off your initial arc, and actually move the characters toward that resolution.  Slice of Life isn't an excuse -- Slice of Life doesn't mean 'plotless'.   Characters and Characterization   If you're working with canon characters, they need to actually BE like those canon characters.  If you're going to break character for canon characters, you better have a strong reason why.  For a non-FOE example, Airstream's Sunfall series has a wildly different Twilight Sparkle than the one in canon MLP, but does an amazing job of setting up why and making her into a convincing character despite being nothing like the Twilight you see elsewhere.  If you're writing your own characters, make sure you characterize them consistently, and when you shift away from established personality, make that plot driven instead of the result of author's whimsy.  Be aware of common flaws in characterization as well -- Author inserts and Mary Sues are often not evident to a reader immediately, but they are rarely compelling long-term characters.  Characters (like Pinkie Pie) that are senselessly random are usually intrusive -- handle with care.   Length   This is probably the most subjective thing on this list, but the length of your fic needs to be appropriate to the story you are trying to tell.  If you're trying to tell a major epic like the original Fallout: Equestria, don't try to match it for length.  FOE is actually too long for the story it tells, turning away many potential readers through sheer length.  If it weren't for the fact that FOE is so good, I wouldn't have ever finished it.  Everyone I know in real life struggles to slog through the story at roughly the 60%-75% mark because it spends too many words on too little development.  Learn when and where to cut stuff.  Consider your story plans - will it work better by cutting the story in half and having a sequel?  In most cases, this is a smarter approach.  It will improve the cohesion of BOTH stories, and will likely attract more readers -- short fics are far more likely to gain interest, giving the initial fic more exposure, and then if it is good enough to make people WANT a sequel, you already have an established reader base."
falloutequestria,354th7,Xypher_cha,2,Thu May 7 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"Overzealous spaming can be a turn off for a lot of people. Mentioning it once or twice some where will help but if you keep plugging it over and over again people will start to roll their eyes  People have gone over a lot of stuff that I agree with for most part. One big thing a lot of people didn't mention though was the concept of ""explain your shit"". Basically have stuff make sense in context. Everything should have a reason for being there even if not explicitly said. At the same time don't over explain things as this can turn in to a rambling mess of details and leaves no room for a readers interpretation.   Another big one.   Know where you are going! romping and sclice of life can be fun once in a while but they should be used in conjunction with the plot as a sort of rest stop, an emotional release or something to let the wheels cool. If there isn't enough glue to hold the story together it will fall apart.  Like I said before everything should have a reason. Any adventure or arche should have a definite relation to the over arching plot even if it's not obvious at the time.   Basically in general don't brake immersion, have interesting charachters and plot and the readers will come."

Moreover, although I cannot and will not condone what was said by anyone during all of that, I am... relieved that it happened. It's very clear now that we, as a community, needed to vent out some frustration.   Thankfully, due in large part to the events over the past few days we may now have the drive to move forwards. The steps we take now will matter in the years and decades to come. Yes, I said decades, with community support we can and (hopefully) will be around for quite a while.

falloutequestria,34zey0,0megaRidley,17,Tue May 5 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"I can't answer every question you asked here, but as a fan of this community, this little sub fandom, who wants to see it thrive, I can at least give two hints on what gets ME interested in reading a story.  First of all, get a goddamn COVER PICTURE for your story. Find an artist, harass them, commission them (or just request a picture if they're doing it for free), and make sure it's a good picture. Why ? When I scroll through the millions of stories posted on the monthly update on EQD, my eyes don't even stop unless I see a picture other than the FOE logo.   Cover pictures are very important, they attract the eye of everyone, especially if they're well made. Unless you have a pretty, shiny piece of cover art, there's a 99% chance that nobody will look at your story because it doesn't stand out.   Yeah, it's easy for me to say that, I'm an artist, I'm just trying to make money, but I actually care deeply about this sub fandom, and once the behemoth that is Horizons is finished, a lot of people who don't read other stories will start looking for something else or leave. That's your chance, writers ! Catch their eye with a shiny cover, suck them into YOUR corner of the wasteland !  (I have so much left to say about this and I'm already 1200 words iiin !) I'm going to point out a few covers I think are really well done and immediately attract the eye, THESE PICTURES WERE INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR ME TO GIVE A FRICK ABOUT THE STORIES BEHIND THEM !  Rangers of Wintertrot cover by Kalemon   Murky Number Seven covers 1 2 3 by Olafski/Mech/Myself  The Ditzy Doo Chronicles cover by MisterMech  There are much more, but you won't look at more than three links anyway  The authors of these stories actually cared enough to spare some money and spend it on an artist's work, and in return, their stories caught my eye immediately and I read them. Talk with the artist, don't just ask for something and have them do it for you. A lot of them know how composition and colors work in order to attract the eye, and can hugely improve upon your original idea (and logo ! Maybe ask for a custom logo!).  On the other hand, if I see a cover made using vectors and bad MS Paint/Photoshop skills, there's actually a big chance that i'll be turned away ! I realize this may hurt some people who put a lot of effort into their covers, but it's just best to ask someone who knows the science behing this. Also, avoid abstract covers at all costs ! stuff like Twilight's cover while well made, doesn't work anymore. Huge landscapes, big battles, epic scenes, or campfire stories, showcasing the characters, the new places i'm going to explore, that's what gets me hooked !  The second thing, and let's keep this one short, is the name of your story. Don't always try to sound cool or dark or mysterious. In recent memory, the stories that caught my attention because of their titles were Rangers of Wintertrot, Murky Number Seven, Sisters, Pink Eyes and Outlaw. There are probably more but that's all I can think of on the top of my head."
falloutequestria,34zey0,Harakou,7,Tue May 5 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"This. Art in general! If I see good, impactful art of a story, it gets me interested. It doesn't even have to be a cover page: just something that ends up on the sub here can get me curious about a story's characters."

falloutequestria,34zey0,Hnetu,4,Tue May 5 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"This whole thread of discussion is a good one. Good covers get results...   I responded here specifically because I think it's true. Both in FoE and outside of it, seeing lots of art of a character helps to spur people's interest. I've mentioned the feedback loop before, and I think that art is one of the biggest parts of it. Seeing a character a lot makes you either sick of them, or makes you want to know more about them.  This was actually advice I offered years ago at an artist panel at an anime convention. People were wondering how to get people in to read their comics; my suggestion? Stand alone pictures. Get people to fall in love with the characters, and then they find out there's a story about them and they're hooked."
falloutequestria,34zey0,Marioaddict,4,Wed May 6 05:58:35 2015 UTC,"...well then.  Out of curiosity, do you take commissions? You seem to know quite a bit about how cover art should look, so if I need to get some done anyways..."

falloutequestria,34zey0,luckystar365,2,Wed May 6 14:04:11 2015 UTC,The key point is probably that people might judge your work by the cover picture.  Whether or not it's a vector is not really that important if it catches the person's attention and makes them wonder about the story.  A picture is worth a thousand words after all  Forgive me as I dodge a boot to the head for using cliches.
falloutequestria,34zey0,codepony,3,Wed May 6 17:22:44 2015 UTC,Cover art is great but you do realize back when most of the now big name fics started they too started out with vectors or no cover art at all. Some like to wait till their story is more conceived before committing to a commission or cover art.  It's a great suggestion to make but don't write it like a story is worthless without art.  Second you should consider not everyone has money to spend on a good piece of art. Writing is free it costs nothing to write and publish a story besides time and effort. That shouldn't disqualify them as a potential great reads because they can't afford artwork. Some big fics at first got covers by fans; can't get fans before the story comes out ;)  btw I myself will offer very low cost( 20$ or less) commissions to help as one solution for that problem. But a fic shouldn't be automatically purposefully recommended to be passed over because it's lacking art.    If someone had a pony vector cover at least they tried. We should be encouraging not discouraging.  Story great. Cover art even better. Bound in hard back ready to sit on a bookshelf awesome! But they all have to start from the bottom and work their way up.

Unless you have a pretty, shiny piece of cover art, there's a 99% chance that nobody will look at your story because it doesn't stand out.   That's going to probably be one of the main points when we lay down a baseline or guidelines to help authors.  For the proposed EqD post, it will be imperative to have eye-catching art to divert the reader's eye and attention to the post.  It's something that seems simple or even trivial, but it could make all the difference in making that ice-breaker."
falloutequestria,34zey0,Marioaddict,2,Wed May 6 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, get a goddamn COVER PICTURE for your story.   This ^  Plus, on the monthly (late) updates on EqD, stories with pictures get priority in the listings and appear first.

falloutequestria,34zey0,2woToned,4,Wed May 6 03:07:05 2015 UTC,"It could, and I think it would. If the goal is at least in part to avert future drama, this system needs a lot of careful thought."
falloutequestria,34zey0,KrootLoops,3,Wed May 6 05:57:36 2015 UTC,I think a system of subscribers voting for a selection of stories and then the mods choosing one of those could work. It puts the mods (who ideally won't be trying to abuse the system) between the (abuseable) votes and the final product.
falloutequestria,34zey0,Hnetu,4,Wed May 6 06:43:15 2015 UTC,"That's how I operate a ~2000 member/watcher DA group.  Community input is key, but people can abuse the system.  The DA poll feature, for example, allows anyone (member or not) to vote, and people can create multiple accounts to stuff the ballot box as it were.  We moved most of our voting to Strawpoll actually.  If I remember correctly, reddit is able to control karma even if you are using multiple accounts.  I know that is the case with threads, but Im not sure if it is the same thing for comments.  If comment karma is controlled by Reddit algorithms that prevent abuse, then that might be the most viable option for ""voting""  Say for instance, we have a monthly recommendation thread as we do now.  We take the votes from individual top-level comments regarding a particular story, and then consider them.  We'll need to set a few guidelines to set a baseline of quality (say cover art, executive summary, tags, regular updates).  These guidelines are specifics to the internal process of giving the short list (or one) to EqD tri-monthly.  Again, it's effectively going to be bypassing their pre-readers.  I don't know if having our own pre-readers is going to be viable and unbiased.  It may be more fair to simply go off votes-by-comment-karma.  Basically popular vote wins.  Just suggestions.  We (mods) will definitely need to be more active in the process.  I think our fanfic-specific mod /u/2woToned will be in charge of the process if he would like.  He's here already to provide support and development of the fanfiction part of the community."
falloutequestria,34zey0,Marioaddict,3,Wed May 6 13:59:23 2015 UTC,"I'd be down for that. We already have a method of sidefic voting from each month with the recommendation thread. From the prior three monthly top spots we can have a group of someones pick what they believe to be the best of those. Figuring out who would be those someones would be our only hang-up.  A lot of members in this community are (rightfully) emotionally invested in their own works, and in the works of another. I have my favorites, I know. Having your favorite work, or your own work shoved out of the spotlight because somebody is buddy-buddy with someone in control is both frustrating and depressing. I'd hate to think that we've lost writers, artists, musicians, and the like because they never thought their efforts would bare fruit.  In her blog posts, Kkat kept talking about how the sidefics shouldn't be seen as bound to either the original work or to other sidefics.

Hence the reason why I am trying to get the grander community involved and have as much transparency as possible.  I've seen ""pony poltiics"" from the inside and out for years, and I despise them.  Unfortuneatly, it's a reality we face and that is why I try to run my communities objectively while still exploiting what I can from the outside to benefit the whole.

Either that or she was tired of answering question about what happenes in the story off-screen.    ""Putting on a pedestal"" can take different meanings and tones based on context.  In this specific context, featuring stories allows us to present a focused outreach to the larger MLP community.    Look at how posts on EqD work:  Specific posts garner more views/comments/etc than compilations.  Having a specific post about a specific story or two allows us to pull a story out from the obscurity of a compilation and into the front-and-center of a reader's mind.  The reason they are being featured is because they represent the community first (as selected by the community).  The tertiary benefit is that they might be rewarded for their hard work with attention.  Also, I think it's best not to feature a story more than once or atleast give room for others.    I think the saying ""If everybody is special, no one is"" and the Season 5 premier sum up my feelings on not featuring/puting on pedestal."
falloutequestria,34zey0,Hnetu,2,Wed May 6 17:08:43 2015 UTC,"Oh I have no problem with elevating any number of sidefics above for the world to see. What I meant was that the major five were placed in the spotlight and then left there. No communication, no adding more stories, nothing. It's why we're here now. I don't mean that no one should be in the spotlight, just that we (general we) picked our favorites and stagnated."
falloutequestria,34zey0,Marioaddict,3,Wed May 6 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"The stories that get individual posts already are grandfathered in apparently.  It's a holdover from a more simpler time for both EqD and FoE in general.  That's how I understand it at least.    The issue of the pedestal comes from consumer opinions skimming the surface and only pulling from the larger fics.  Since the key focus is to drive attention to lesser-known fics, the larger ones would be excluded from those posts.  Lets face it:  We've got a whole range of commitment across the board, and the largest one is probably the casual consumer (the one main fic kind of reader).  If we can steer them in the right direction, we might be able to drive a boost to activity in a more wholistic approach."
falloutequestria,34zey0,OlimarandLouie,2,Wed May 6 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"regular updates   Define ""regular updates,"" please? That's probably the one criteria you've chosen that I don't think is quite up to par. Writing schedules differ between people (look how long it takes No One, Fuzzy, Somber to update) but that doesn't mean the stories are dead. I only say this because I often have a lot going on IRL that takes time away from my writing, which can lead to a bit of a delay on an update. I really don't think circumstances outside of one's control should disqualify someone.  If we're talking about years since a story's last update disqualifying it for selection, then that's quite a bit more reasonable."
falloutequestria,34zey0,ReversedCarrot,2,Wed May 6 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"^ This  Regular means different things to different people, and different things per story sometimes even. I remember a time when I could slam out a chapter in a month; editing process and all.  Sadly, life has a way of saying 'nah, bro' sometimes.

Hell, MN7 is one of the biggest stories around, it's considered one of the Big 5, it has a massive following and is a mere 3 chapters from completing yet..... It hasn't updated in ages because Fuzzy got a new job and that totally borked his writing schedule, setting him back a while.  Covers? Yeah that's totally easy. It only takes one picture. Summaries? Those take a short time to write, and you only really have to do it once. Tags? It's a few check boxes. Updates? That's such a massive can of worms... As long as the story's not DEAD, y'know?"
falloutequestria,34zey0,Riellendor,2,Wed May 6 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"That's for the subreddit/community to decide.  I am merely throwing ideas out there.  Personally, I'd consider ""regular"" as updates ""quarterly"" or every 6 months.  Though, as I said, those guidelines are to be community decided."
falloutequestria,34zey0,KrootLoops,4,Wed May 6 16:37:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this will be a good idea or no, but I'll throw it out anyways.  Over on /r/Games, they have a weekly discussion thread set up that's dedicated to one given game every week. Some weeks it will be a well known game, others it will be something more obscure. But regardless, it draws attention to one specific game at a time.  Maybe we could have something like a fic of the week, either instead of or in addition to the monthly suggestion thread? We would pick one fanfic to set as the topic of discussion for that week. Those who haven't read it will have it brought to their attention, and those who HAVE will get a nice place to talk about it.  Of course, then the issue becomes how to pick which fic will be featured in any given week... maybe people could submit their fics for the opportunity to be the fic of the week?  I dunno, I just thought I'd throw this out there."
falloutequestria,34zey0,TheShadowKick,3,Tue May 5 21:48:46 2015 UTC,"Of course, then the issue becomes how to pick which fic will be featured in any given week... maybe people could submit their fics for the opportunity to be the fic of the week?   I think this would work great, maybe we can create a queue people can apply to put their story or another person's story on? Perhaps a 3 month cooldown for each story to prevent hogging the spotlight?"
falloutequestria,34zey0,AmethystWind,5,Tue May 5 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"Three months is good, given the length of some of these stories.  If dedicated discussion threads bring in new readers, we need to allow them time to read stories they may not have before. A perfect example is MN7 which is (like many of the big stories) hundreds of thousands of words long. Allowing people time to play catch up and still make it in time for discussion is a good idea."
falloutequestria,34zey0,Hnetu,3,Wed May 6 06:02:55 2015 UTC,"Within the context of my edit to the thread, I think picking weekly favorites would be a good foundation for tri-monthly recommendations to EqD for their feature post."
falloutequestria,34zey0,mego-pie,5,Tue May 5 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"So how exactly would that work then? Every week we pick one story to showcase, and then at the end of three months we choose one of those stories to showcase to EQD? Or something like that?"
falloutequestria,34zey0,4fffs,4,Tue May 5 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"An issue I can see arising is vote manipulation, because we are still a relatively small community, one person theoretically could easily abuse the system."

falloutequestria,34zey0,mego-pie,3,Wed May 6 03:32:53 2015 UTC,"I'll be god damned. I don't think I stand a chance when the cooldown period gives a much heavier weight to the decision, but it's hope at last. I imagine Murky, Hooves of Fate and Sisters will probably steamroll everyone out of the gate."
falloutequestria,34zey0,4fffs,5,Tue May 5 22:19:16 2015 UTC,I think we should make a point of not choosing already-big stories. The whole point is to avoid having them steamroll everyone out of the gate.
falloutequestria,34zey0,mego-pie,4,Tue May 5 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"Sisters isn't a big story, not yet. Still, I'm glad it's getting more attention, as it is a very enjoyable piece of writing."

falloutequestria,34zey0,Arowid,0,Wed May 6 06:05:32 2015 UTC,perhaps we could have the mods pick them?  no chance of vote bias that way! i think we can also trust the mods to not be silly about it.   the mods could pick one from the weekly suggestion threads. in mod we trust

The fewer people involved in choosing then the more impactful their biases will be. Why should the tastes of a couple potentially screw people out of their one and only chance?  As for the new mod, yeah, theres a reason #foechat exists in addition to #falloutequestria, and he is part of it. And he is especially known for his biases and special exceptions for his friends.

falloutequestria,34zey0,TheShadowKick,1 point,Thu May 7 02:18:29 2015 UTC,honestly i'm more worried about mob rule or vote brigading if it was left open to public vote and it can't just be a first come first serve basis as there is then no screening of the content.  perhaps a representative democracy would be best? each community electing a representative to pic a fic?
falloutequestria,34zey0,volrathxp,1 point,Thu May 7 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"democracy is always best, just havent figured out the implementation.  But just giving picking rights to a few with no oversight or accountability is a big no-no, would be like big business writing their own tax code."

falloutequestria,34zey0,WeAreBorgPony,3,Thu May 7 03:07:00 2015 UTC,"I had tried before to do a discussion post for FOE Outlaw here. I was just experimenting to see what stuck, but due to low turnout I kinda gave up on it. If people would be up for it I could do it again. It was going to be a once-a-month thing, based on the previous month recommendation thread's top spot.   I was shooting to where each month would have recurring weekly events. The AMA's, monthly sidefic threads, the discussion thread, and another something would happen each month. Even with the verbosity of recent events I'm still concerned about over-saturating the userbase with too much stuff."
falloutequestria,34zey0,yetanotherpony,8,Tue May 5 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, while I was one of those voices shrieking in frustration and anger over everything that's been going on, and my perceived (or real) slights... I'm not unhappy with what's happened.  I feel like a lot of what I said in the first 'drama' thread was wrong. Not because it might have been wrong based on fact or opinion, but how I handled it. I tried my best in the beginning to be level headed and fair, citing the fact that it wasn't one person's writing that was trying to maliciously snuff out others. It's just how things happened over the course of a long-running fandom. It's a multi-faceted situation, there's so much more going on than just one author's opinions and dealings. One author just wants to write their story, it's the will of the fandom, of the community that steers where everything goes. We all want this to be successful, FOE as a whole that is.  So for my part, I apologize for slipping into vitriol and anger, for screaming in hate and anger, instead of keeping it a solid discussion. I shouldn't have gone for petty personal attacks; and while I do feel a LOT of what I said was because of pent up frustration... I shouldn't have let myself get lost in those feelings.  But the real meat of what I'm trying to get at... I'm glad it happened.  We needed a kick in the ass, as a community, to get talks going on how to propel ourselves further. There's been more communication, more discussion, in the past few days; both here and in the rage thread and in the one Somber posted than there has been in the past six months. (I'm being mildly hyperbolic, I didn't actually count the posts.) We needed it. We needed it badly. Our community had become a long-standing relationship with lots of tension. One big fight was that breaking point that's made way for healing to begin. I think that right now, we're in the process of it. We're talking, we're looking at ways to make it better for everyone.  Suggestions on how to get more exposure, more integration, more everything is going on. And this is for everyone. How to create feedback loops, how to get better cover pictures, all sorts of things. And these things benefit everyone, from the top to the bottom and everywhere in between. I'm honestly proud that the community has, instead of fracturing further, decided to come together and look at how to lift us higher.  I don't feel like I have any new suggestions to add, things that haven't been said. Good cover art is a big thing. Getting yourself out there is a big thing. Learning and bettering yourself is a good thing. Being willing to admit mistakes and go back and edit problems is a good thing. Workshopping is a good thing. The future possibility of the occasional EqD post is a massive thing, because 1 per 3 months is a long shot better than 0 per ever.  I'm sorry I stooped to such low levels, but dammit I'm glad that something wonderful has happened because of it."

I was a bit disappointed in how everyone seemed so eager to attack each other, but now that the ball is rolling I can't help but marvel at what has transpired.  There is a TON of thought being put into this by a LOT of people, and it's all for the betterment of the community as a whole.  Personally, I'm pretty excited about the times ahead of us.

falloutequestria,34zey0,KaiserVonIkapoc,4,Wed May 6 06:44:16 2015 UTC,"""I spoke to my friend Seth of Equestria Daily a few minutes ago and I talked him into a plan I hope would help. He wants to take a new approach because your sub-fandom is a strong one with many creative people. Every 3 months EQD would like to spotlight a new FoE fic as chosen not by his pre-readers, but by yours. ""   I have several questions concerning this.  How would this work?   Would we have pre-readers selected from the FoE community?  Would they be expected to follow the same standards that EQD pre-readers do already?  Furthermore, at what point is a story ineligible to be featured in this fashion?  I've heard before when EQD supposedly re-opened FoE submissions that they would not take FoE stories that were too graphic or dark (which is sort of like a double standard given most FoE stories naturally include some graphic violence of some sort).  I ask a lot of this because I know that I would absolutely love to have Starlight featured, but I know for certain that there are still some issues in the early chapters (and even despite editors, not everyone catches everything), not to mention how large Starlight is in general (660k is a major chunk of ponyfic).  So yeah, very curious about this idea.  It sounds great on paper, for sure, and it would be awesome for stories to have this kind of exposure.  Just, the logistics of it would need to be worked out heavily to make it work properly."
falloutequestria,34zey0,yetanotherpony,6,Wed May 6 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"I second this.  Hearing that they'll take 1 per 3 months is a huge improvement over 0 per ever.

The meat and potatoes of that offer is that WE choose (outside of EqD pre-readers) what gets featured.  So effectively, if we choose to go along with the proposed compromise for EqD exposure, then we need to figure out how best to come up with the featured story or couple of stories."

I had seen the idea of a ""After Hours"" post for this, and I think that would probably be a good idea."

Maybe if the foe fandom had a site that could showcase stories the way EqD does, this wouldn't be coming up, or if EqD would accept FoE stories again.  Whenever I bring up EqD, people will invariably say ""oh forget those guys, they're jerks,"" but they are still the ones who get the most traffic in the fandom.  Maybe if there was community pressure to open EqD up again, this discussion wouldn't need to happen.  And I apologize for my poor grammar here.  I'm stuck on my phone, and it makes editing difficult."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheDoctorHam,12,Sun May 3 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"Truth be told that's part of the reason for the recommendation threads each month. I'm hoping to insite some form of creativity and discussion amongst the fandom. I like reddit's comment formatting as it allows for open, yet easily followable, discussion. I feel like this could be a truly great platform for all things Fallout Equestria, but it still needs more... something.   I also wish there were more open discussions outside of whenever Somber/PH is brought up."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,2woToned,6,Sun May 3 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"And truth be told I really love that the recommendation thread gets as many duggestions each month as it does, and I think it's a great way for people to get the qord out about their story or recommend a favorite.  But while I have you here, can I mention the sidebar link to the years-old ""sidefic recommendation thread?""  Should that be replaced with whatever the current month's recommendation thread is, or have the monthly recommendations link added to it?"

falloutequestria,34q7zf,2woToned,3,Sun May 3 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"Actually here's an honest question that I can remember thinking before.  There have been a few AMAs on the subreddit now, but almost all of them have been for artists.  And for the record I absolutely do not mean to dimish the contributions of artists to the community, but I'm honestly wondering why there haven't been more of them for authors?  Granted I think there have only been 5 so far, but I remember that the AMA for No One got a lot of activity and engaging discussion about the story, which I was thrilled to read and take part in.  Just a thought that occurred to me, and I'm totally abusing this thread to ask it."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheDoctorHam,4,Mon May 4 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"I think No_One did one a while ago. But yeah, you're right. EDIT: I suck at reading compr--no, just at reading. You literally mentioned that directly. Ka-derp. Plz see rest of post 4 intaresting thotz.  I have a theory that it's easier to become a popular artist because they create complete pieces that can be consumed in their entirety with little time commitment on the part of the viewer. What impact they have is both immediate and total.  See link, click link, observe art, upvote. Less than a minute, done.  Stories take a lot more time to read. They're harder to consume by their nature.  I mean no value judgments on either medium or the folks that work in them. Just thinking about how the different media are consumed, and how that may shape recognition."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,yetanotherpony,3,Mon May 4 22:20:19 2015 UTC,"It's far easier now with the recommendation threads to see which authors the sub would like to hear from. As well as which ones are still active. From the start it was easier to go with artists because it's easier to quickly glance at vote count and submissions to figure who the majority of people would like to hear from.  Now I'll have a pool to start drawing from. Unfortunately our last AMA was quite vacant, which is quite disheartening. I'm hoping it is due to most of our users being caught up in schooling and our next one is a little more active."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,2woToned,2,Mon May 4 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"I would love to do an AMA, if you are looking for authors that are interested in it."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,volrathxp,4,Tue May 5 01:57:02 2015 UTC,"but it still needs more... something.   More traffic is what it needs, especially the monthly recommendation threads."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Veeron,3,Sun May 3 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the recommendation thread is only going to grab people that are already reading FOE stories, and just looking for a new one. EqD pages get new, specifically fresh blood into the subfandom. There's a huge difference between the two, but I do love the monthly recommendations thread."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Hnetu,22,Tue May 5 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"First of all I want to say that you coming here in the with the intentions of apologizing for your past actions is very appreciated, it takes guts to stand next to something you did and call yourself out.  I can understand what you mean, over the past two years a friend and I have started writing our own FOE spinoff, and for me this is my first time ever really touching something of this magnitude.  I am still learning what it takes to try to make a great story out of basically nothing.    As for your EQD fame, I never blamed you for that.  Project Horizons is your child, of course you want it to do well, and especially in recent times EQD has really gone down the shitter in terms of what fics they support, and which ones they don't.  I have a friend who wrote some really good stories, and then submitted them to EQD just to get told ""no, we won't put this on our site because of reasons.""  Which is one of the few reasons I no longer visit EQD, or trust anything they put out at face value.  You should be proud of your story, for a very long time it really was one of the greatest stories the fandom produced, up there with Kkat's original story, and it's by no means your fault that it absolutely exploded.  In my opinion a lot of that popularity came from the fact that Project Horizons was a very good early spinoff.  That being the case, a lot of people who had never even tried to write a story before looked at it and said ""I can do that too!""  which saturated the market with an unbelievable amount of terrible fiction.  People read the terrible stories and then gravitate back to Project Horizons, which has been an anchor of quality for a long time, and it rather hurt a little bit to watch Blackjack go from being the self sacrificing hero to princess incarnate cyber alicorn with borderling omniscience.  One of my very close friends was actually the person who got me into the FOE fandom by using Project Horizons, that was three years ago now and I really am grateful for you giving me a door into this whole seemingly separate fandom.  With all of its ups and downs I still have found a lot of great people and a lot of great art for some really great stories.  Lastly, it isn't Project Horizons, by itself, that crowds people out.  I am part of the writing community and I know how hard it is for anyone to get their story noticed in this sea of garbage with the titans looming overhead, not just Project Horizons, but the rest of the big five, Heroes, Murky Number Seven, and Pink Eyes.  It is all but impossible for a lot of good quality new stories to gain any traction after all the people who have no business writing have flooded the market with garbage.  I blame those people, not you, not Fuzzy, not No 1ne, not Mimezinga, nor Kkat.  I do think it is wrong for people to place all of that blame on you, but you really painted a target on you chest with some of your past comments.    Your apology here does mean a lot, at least to me.  At the same time though I think Project Horizons has been slowly been getting more and more sick as time has worn on, and that the best thing for everyone would be if you just finished it and moved on."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,dizziestbeef,6,Sun May 3 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"You should be more sensitive. People rarely begin as good writers and it can take a while to improve if you weren't already substantially skilled. It's wrong to tell people they shouldn't write at all because they don't meet your minimum standards.   That's not to say that I don't wish the low of quality wasn't quite that low, but I can't really fault anyone for wanting to write and not writing great stuff right out of the gate. Some of it probably is garbage or fairly close to it, but a lot of it just needs some help (and writers willing to take help).    While I try not to blame those whose writing is pretty good for the faults of the masses, their stories do take attention away from other writers, especially if the story drags on and does not resolve itself. People who like such a story may hesitate to bother with the works of other writers if they know that X, the author of Y, will be churning out very regular chapters of Y. That much is fact. There may be works good work lost in the 'sea of garbage' you refer to, but the less people there are sifting through that garbage, the less likely they are to escape.  Also, directly regarding OP, I feel like at the bottom it should 'TL;DR seek more exposure for your story (and maybe crosspost about it elsewhere)'. Further anyone who's writing skill is greater than average should remember that they can take the spotlight away from someone who's work is merely okay and that person may never receive the positivity/affirmation that would push them to improve themselves. It isn't fun having to work/improve in the constant shadow of someone who will always be better than you and who doesn't ever think about where the spotlight is pointed and what effect their presence/participation has on it."

OP's story did kind of reek of ""don't hate the player, hate the game""   I suppose not, but I don't draw the line at hyphens. I just have little patience for people who can't be bothered to use spell-check and refuse to fix errors even when others kindly point them out for fixing. Or those that want to wait until they've written the whole thing (which may never happen) before doing any revision or fixing.    Yes, the OP's post did feel that way. I feel that the players of a game are responsible, to a degree, for how the game plays out..."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,istarian,3,Mon May 4 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"hyphens show connections between between words, they do not act as a pause.  hyphens are not commas.  I do not understand why people can't understand this."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,dizziestbeef,6,Mon May 4 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"However, the emdash acts as an abrupt stop/change in thought, and many people confuse it with a hyphen. Generally (but not always) an emdash can be used in place of a semicolon, and is usually the go-to of choice for informal literature such as a novel. Semicolons are rarely if ever used in novels."

falloutequestria,34q7zf,dizziestbeef,1 point,Tue May 5 00:19:42 2015 UTC,"There may be works good work lost in the 'sea of garbage' you refer to, but the less people there are sifting through that garbage, the less likely they are to escape.   if anything the big fics bring more people in to look through the little guys. they get wrapped up in this amazing world but quickly reach the end of what has already been made by the big guys. then they say "" i want more"" and go digging through the smaller stuff. the issue is that there is little to no filtering to find good new ones due to the fandom being so nebulous. people get tired of looking through the garbage to find a gem to support and just stop.  there would be no place for new fics at all if the big fics weren't around. they're like the fly wheel on a engine. with out them the fandom would stall."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,mego-pie,2,Mon May 4 15:46:53 2015 UTC,"I would debate that. Yes, it's theoretically true, but it doesn't work out that way, especially if the 'big fics' never end. Also, once the people have had the good stuff, they're less willing to risk their time/energy on anything else. It's like going to a fast food place after a 4 star restaurant. It's just not as simple as you think it is. Kind of like trickle-down economics...  The fandom wouldn't stall, it would just shrink a bit."

If anything I'm just relieved that this can be talked about civilly.

falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,1 point,Tue May 5 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"are you saying that the big stories are at fault for being to good? because that's bs. there are plenty of smaller stories of high quality. the issues is that they are surrounded by hundreds of other stories of low quality and/or they're not original enough to stand out against the others.   AND if, hypothetically, ALL the small stories aren't as good (which as i've said is not true) then they don't deserve the same level of attention.   the point is that some deserve more attention do but they don't get it as they are hard to find and many people have given up on looking through the smaller stories after being let down by a story. whether they are let down by a story starting good then going down the drain, a good story not being finished or putting up with a bad story and hoping it will get better."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,mego-pie,1 point,Tue May 5 23:28:02 2015 UTC,"You said elsewhere in this thread that maybe the reason noone speaks about any other story is because they dont feel enthralled by it, that no other stories are enthralling, that no other stories are good enough.  You keep repeating that not enough people are looking for other good fics to read, but gloss over that there are some who have found good other fics, yet these good fics are not discussed at all.  Does there have to be some kind of majority opinion that something is good before even one single person says something or what?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,0,Wed May 6 00:07:40 2015 UTC,no but it has to be enjoyed enough by enough people that one of the people who wanders on to this sub talks about it and another person continues talking about it. this sub is hardly the central hub of all things FO:E sidefic or otherwise. we're a relatively small cross section of the fandom so the likely hood of a small fic getting mentioned here is low. check their FIMfiction pages for discussion if they have one or go check out one of the forums.
falloutequestria,34q7zf,mego-pie,1 point,Wed May 6 01:21:01 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that their authors should be aware of what happens as a result of their works' existence. The way I see it the big stories sometimes have negative impacts on other stories and their authors whether it be a difference in readership or ceasing their efforts because of the perceived ability/inability to match up to that standard. The impact of such may be prolonged if one of these 'big stories' has an indefinite end point. They have a responsibility to recognize those impacts and, to the degree possible and reasonable, to minimize them.  I guess ultimately I am sort of faulting them for being ""too good"", because in doing so they set the bar pretty high. Not that the community isn't at fault for their own decisions or actions regarding what they read/give their attention to. It's just that if an awesome writer steps into the arena, who will be willing to compete? In most cases only those who are pretty good themselves. Everyone else won't bother because they will largely be ignored.  The issue isn't so much whether they deserve the same level of attention as it is whether they deserve attention at all. And I would argue that there are plenty of stories that deserve attention. Mere originality is a poor and unfair criteria since you can have a well written story which doesn't really deviate from the established formula.    What do you consider to make something high or low quality exactly?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,istarian,1 point,Wed May 6 00:50:19 2015 UTC,What do you consider to make something high or low quality exactly?   do i want to keep reading it? yes or no? do i find my self immersed in the story? yes or no? do i want to come back and read it again afterwards?  basically do i enjoy it.  i don't think the bar being raised is an issue. i'd rather have a few good stories that i really like over a bunch of ones i sort of like. as with stories this long you really need to like them to get through it all.  honestly the bar in my opinion is not set by the stories but what will hook most readers enough to keep reading. some of the smaller fics are at or above that bar but have to little exposure to really take off.
falloutequestria,34q7zf,mego-pie,3,Wed May 6 01:14:45 2015 UTC,"That's very subjective criteria and the relationship to quality isn't exactly direct.  What you'd rather have and what is good may be different. I'd rather not have a few people knowingly discouraging others. By which I mean that they are aware that their work causes that. I think the setting the bar too high is an issue. It discourages others from writing because their work is constantly compared to X and then, potentially, insulted by being treated as intrinsically inferior. I also think that some stories are too long and should be edited and/or revised with an eye towards reduction wherever possible so long as the essence of the story is preserved. There is an optimal length, although I wouldn't profess to be sure of exactly where the line lies.  A lack of exposure is not helped by very large stories (in excess of 20-30 chapters worth) which keep people busy reading them and draw their attention away from checking out new stories that are shorter, less well developed, and not as complete. If the original fallout equestria had gone on for two or three times as long, what effect would that have had?   I'm assuming something like 5k words a chapter is 20 pgs/chapter, 20 chapters * 20 pgs./chapter = 400 pages"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,istarian,0,Wed May 6 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"i felt that was extremely broad criteria. ""do people like reading it"" seems to be the best indicator of quality.   the large fics do help, if anything, as they are what bring people in to the community. it's not like my whole month's free time is devoted to the newest chapter of PH of MN7. i have plenty of time for looking at smaller fics (as do most people)."

falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,5,Wed May 6 01:29:51 2015 UTC,"I figured I might as well toss my two bits in the barrel.  I usually don't participate in these kinds of discussions but this is a fairly big deal.  I feel that to an extent, PH is stifling some creativity in other stories, but the issue isn't totally your fault.  An example I can best give here is my wife has been trying to come up with a good set of concepts for her own fic ideas, but one of the most common things I get asked is whether Horizons did it already.  The concern that has brewed there is that if Horizons did it, then other readers will view stories that address similar subject matter or contradictory subject matter negatively.  Of course I have told her that it is her playground and she can do whatever she wants, but that doesn't make that feeling fully go away.  From my own perspective, having spent two years of solid work on a very large chunk of completed FOE, I will admit that there were a few times that I could say that I was jealous of PH and it's inherent fame, when my own work didn't seem to be getting much discussion either.  However, I'm not anymore.  I focused on trying to get Starlight completed instead, and ultimately I was happier for it.  I think that entering this realm is daunting for newer writers because there is a lot of pressure to adhere to specific quality, and so few people willing to discuss to make it better.  The monthly sidefic recommendations threads are trying to help that and the foewriters subreddit tried as well.  I'm really not sure what the answer is here personally."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,volrathxp,11,Mon May 4 14:45:32 2015 UTC,"Alright, I wasn't going to say anything about all of this.  But since you responded to me specifically and this... discussion keeps going, I might as well wade into this mess.  Let me start off by saying that I am one of the writers you insulted.  I am the author of Fallout Equestria: Sisters.    I should also state that I do not particularly care for Project Horizons.  I mean you no offense, but my biggest complaint with your story is that I felt that Blackjack's character development was lackluster and nonsensical.  I enjoyed the early chapters, but stopped reading a long time ago.  Now with all of that out of the way I should state that I don't think you deserved the vitriol and hate that came your way.  It was unwarranted and petty.  However, you have to expect some blowback whenever you make broad generalizations that encompass entire groups of people.  To suggest that any story less popular than PH is not garnering as much attention due to inferior writing is arrogant.  Murky Number Seven is also less popular than PH, but is nearly universally lauded for its quality.  (For the record, I am not caught up with either of these works, and while I could have probably spoken of a story not in the big 5, I just wanted to draw attention to the problem of your word choice.)  I am one of the authors that could make the claim that Horizons' popularity is a detriment to my own story, but do I?  Of course not!  That would be preposterous.  I am thrilled for you that PH is as popular as it has become.  I wish you, personally, nothing but the best.  You have not wronged me in any way by pouring your heart into your work, and I can sympathize with the passion you feel towards your labor of love.  I feel quite the opposite, in fact.  If Sisters becomes as great as I hope it will, that will be due in part to my learning from what I perceive as your mistakes.  ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.""  I do not believe that Sisters has been hurt at all by Project Horizons.  The two stories blatantly contradict each other enough that neither will affect the other in any meaningful way.  And I do make efforts to grab up the readers that do not enjoy your own story because of that.  This town is, in fact, big enough for all of us.  Was I insulted by your insinuation that my writing was inferior to your own?  A little, I suppose.  But I can get over it.  It's no biggy.  Besides, being able to accept criticism and use it to help me hone my craft is just another part of being a writer.  I'll just use that to further motivate myself to keep improving.  And I understand that there is still a lot of room for me to improve.  I believe that the real issues are that A: There are just so very many sidefics all competing for attention, and B: writers in this community do not have a good place to publish their work.  Fimfiction downright despises FoE stories, as evidenced by the votebombing.  I've personally seen downvotes on some of my chapters within minutes of their publishing.  New stories are almost invariably greeted with a hefty red bar.  Some stories escape this.  Most don't.  Unfortunately Fimfiction is basically the only gig in town.  We could just use Gdocs, but it's harder for a reader to comment if all they have is an email address.  With no other good avenue for exposure, most FoE stories are doomed to wither and die in obscurity when their author garners no attention and loses all motivation to continue.  I can understand how some people might see Horizons as having an unfair advantage when it comes to exposure due to having its own EQD page, but to lash out at you for promoting your own fic is ludicrous.  We all want exposure.  But we don't need to hurl insults at each other because of it.   It's a bad state for our little subfandom to be in, but I don't know how we can fix it.       TL:DR    All of this mess was pointless and unnecessary.  I imagine that most of the authors who weighed in (myself included) are now lamenting how responding to this little spat took precious time away from our ability to keep doing what we love.  So let's just put this behind us and get back to writing, eh?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Arowid,3,Mon May 4 00:13:42 2015 UTC,"To suggest that any story less popular than PH is not garnering as much attention due to inferior writing is arrogant.    I wholeheartedly agree, but I don't think that's what he's doing here. He suggested that some of the problem is due to poor writing, but I think he covers other reasons, including the presence of PH.  Other than that, though, very well said. I think this crisis will pass if we all just agree to stop fighting and keep writing."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,ArgonGlow,0,Mon May 4 02:14:45 2015 UTC,"Its what he did in the murky thread, to Hnetu no less, author of a story of something like 500k words, by no means an awful 2 chapter dimeadozen abandoned fansplatter.  This recent drama all started as Somber says, by him interjecting rudely and arrogantly into a discussion about how things should improve for minority writers when PH, something thats been here all our lives in this community, leaves the stage.  Of course somber got some backlash for what he said, some people overreacted, in part because some of us are just F-----ng fed up with getting dogpiled with expert opinions and actual actuaries telling us that our feelings are invalid and that we should not voice them.  Some of us have been forced out of our communities because of this sentiment of shouting down anyone who feels the focus should not sit so tightly with PH. Many of us have been bullied and excommunicated because fans of PH cannot allow other people their own opinions or feelings, much less respect them.  edit- typo"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,4,Mon May 4 02:47:40 2015 UTC,"To be entirely honest, I never saw any sort of bullying or shunning or anything like that in this community until this morning. The way I see it, people were going completely off the deep end in attacking Somber and his story in a thread that originally had nothing to do with PH at all. When Somber showed up to defend himself, they (and you in particular) decided to pick out one sentence of his post and take it in the worst possible way. Yes, what he said can be taken in an offensive way, and that's exactly what he's apologizing for here.  You are always welcome to voice your opinions, just don't be a dick about it."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,ArgonGlow,-7,Mon May 4 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"I shall post here what I posted there for this, noone was attacking Somber or PH before he arrived and made his inflammatory comment.  prior to somber chiming in with his judgement we had...   Someone stating that PH killed off other authors and explaining how which is an entirely valid and not attacking opinion Someone noting that several fics actually finished and werent even acknowledged due to focus on PH, also not attacking Somber A person agreeing that is seems reasonable that writers would be put off competing with something like PH, its okay to acknowledge that people might feel this way, and that doesnt equate to attacking Somber Someone saying that they know first hand that writers will be returning after PH finishes, also not an attack A comparison to Mr Burns blocking out the sun, is this an attack? no its not, saying for example that there are a lot of cheap foreign cars on the road is not an attack on foreign car companies.   Not one attack or comment about the quality of Sombers work apart from here  These people were voicing their opinions, then others came it and were dicks to them, lead by Somber. And it was 2 sentences, the first suggesting that when somber goes he's taking his readers with him, and the second suggesting quality is the difference to being acknowledged and not, both were pretty offensive particularly to victims of said bullying.  As for elsewhere in the community that this kind of bullying goes on, try 4chan, the forum, the wiki and the IRC and the people who are no longer welcome there."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,1 point,Mon May 4 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"i think it's just that there is such a high volume of new/small fics, most of which aren't that good. of course there is a diamond in the rough but people get tired of looking through the rough very quickly especially when most stories are so long.   the only reason small fics have any attention at all is because the big fics pull new readers in. they're the fly wheel of the fandom."

With no other good avenue for exposure, most FoE stories are doomed to wither and die in obscurity when their author garners no attention and loses all motivation to continue.   It's only when you say this that I wonder, would we be better off with our own host site to post work on, a foefiction.com or something. It would allow for some of the less well known quality fics to have a stage to stand on, rather than require an individual to go looking for it and possibly skimming over it. I know I did that with Sisters, but now that I've seen it held up and hailed in the past few weeks, I think I'll give it a try.   But my point is do we need to create a new platform for our work? Not break ties with fimfiction, but just make it a secondary platform. This fandom has created a website for itself before (fallout-equestria.com) so there is precedent.   Now, I'm not volunteering as it would take a whole summer for me to make a rubbish fanfic-hosting website, but it might be worth planting the seed of discussion and seeing if it germinates at all in the fandom. But if this question of exposure continues at all, we might need to have a discussion about this.  Any problems jump out?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Veradon,3,Mon May 4 09:55:47 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for giving Sisters your consideration.  It can be pretty tough to rake in new readers, and I cherish the ones that I have.  As for the other bit...  I think the idea has been tossed around before.  There would be several pros and cons to creating an entirely different site to host FoE related stories.  You'd be able to curtail the automatic downvotes, but honestly that's only one facet of a greater problem.  I believe the core issue lies entwined with the sheer amount of stories this subfandom generates.  The number of aspiring authors wishing to play around in this world is a testament to how effectively Kkat crafted her tale.  Just like LittlePip was able to inspire ponies across The Wasteland, Kkat inspired many of us to create.  The tragic truth is that this also has a terrible side effect.  There are thousands of FoE sidefics.  When faced with the enormity of that pool to draw from, it is altogether too easy for anyone to become apathetic towards new material.  I hate to admit it, and I feel awful about it, but I'm certainly not innocent when it comes to this matter.  I'm not sure if any of the other authors feel this way, and I wouldn't dare speak for them, but ever since I began working on my own story I've noticed that my desire to read FoE sidefics has dwindled drastically.  Whenever I read another author's story, not only do I feel oddly guilty for not working on Sisters, but the urge for me to write is overpowering.  My own ""read later"" list has shrunk down to three works lately.  (Wasteland Economics, Old Souls, and Morality of Property in case you were interested.)  I try to leave comments on stories when I can, as I know just how satisfying it is to know that someone even bothered to read what my editor and I have slaved over for so long, but the truth is that I just don't read sidefics like I used to.  I'd rather create my own.  Sadly, I perpetuate what I see as a problem within our community, but I cannot bring myself to change my ways.  Those are just my reasons for not participating as much as I feel I should in a community that I love.  Even for all of our recent bickering, I understand that our devotion to our works is derived from our truly sincere passion for storytelling.  I wish every author the best, but I know that it will take all of us, as a community, to go out and read new fics and encourage others to keep writing.  Efforts like the Monthly Sidefic Recommendation Thread help greatly.  I feel that the Recommendation Thread is a great way for others to easily see and discuss new and upcoming fics.  Perhaps if it were a bit more fleshed out?  Actual discussion of stories instead of simply giving a name and a link?  I'm not trying to detract from the Recommendation Thread, I simply think that it could be used as an easy method to solve this dilemma in a way most everyone would find satisfactory.  I greatly encourage any and all constructive criticism of my own work, and I imagine that any author here would love nothing more than the opportunity to improve their craft.  Plus, we all like to see whether or not readers actually enjoyed that little joke on page 15, or whether or not they felt the action scene on page 23 was cheesy.  /r/foewriters once had the idea of a weekly or monthly critiquing of FoE stories.  It was meant as a way to better understand what worked in storytelling and what didn't.  If the main FoE sub were to adopt something similar, and encourage discussion of fics on a regular basis, perhaps that could help to alleviate the feeling of ""stagnation"" that others are describing.  I have to admit to some personal bias in that suggestion.  But in all honesty I cannot think of a better way to get much needed feedback to the authors that so desperately crave it.  TL;DR  I think that creating another site to host FoE stories might help with some issues, but would not solve the truly horrendous problem of reader apathy.  The Monthly Sidefic Recommendation Thread feels like our best move forward, but I would like to see it expanded."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Arowid,2,Mon May 4 22:53:06 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, everything you say makes sense. The one thing I'll add is that we should advertise this subreddit on our other platforms more. I was only made aware of it because Somber crossposted on fimfiction and it lead me back here."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Veradon,2,Wed May 6 08:43:15 2015 UTC,"So, I've also stayed out of this discussion so far and at this point this thread is probably so saturated with verbose opinions that I'm not really going to make a dent. But isn't that kind of the problem in a nutshell?  Got-there-first factor is huge. PH benefited from it. FoE itself benefited from it. Equestria Daily benefited from it. My blog benefited from it. I think this isn't a question of crowding out or quality as much as it is of how to direct attention. When communities are in early stages they grab everything they can find and they don't care about quality. I got stories on to Equestria Daily in 2011 that were just objectively awful. Then as a community grows, after a point it reaches this saturation point, after which it becomes too time-consuming to keep tabs on everything new coming out. This is about the time that attention-grabbing factors come in to play.  PH has got-there-first factor. It's been around for a long time and people recognise it. It's built up a kind of brand identity. People can spot Blackjack a million miles away and even get some jokes about the story without having read it, just by cultural osmosis. Then there's the fact that some people love to hate PH, so naturally people angry for any number of reasons are going to find a way to blame it.  It's possible for new things to get momentum if they're persistent, but this is pretty luck-based, and it's more likely to succeed if something is just different enough to start creating a spinoff community with its own fan-works, and restart the whole process. FoE is sort of a mature example of this.  The third big way to grab attention is by just breaking all the rules. The later you are to a community, the more of an outlier it has to be to get it. Some unusual-protagonist stories got traction this way early on, it probably helped Pink Eyes a lot (in combination with got-there-first), and if my own story (Duck and Cover) wasn't completely spitting in the face of the original it probably would have flown under the radar because of how late it was (2013).  Which leaves... the rest. You didn't get there first. You don't have two years of work behind you, you didn't get a lucky break, and your story isn't conceptually gonzo enough to make people double-take when they scroll past it. Unfortunately the mathematics are against the masses, multiplied by the slow pace that comes with a writing community."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,CaptainHoers,1 point,Mon May 4 11:55:53 2015 UTC,"Treasure Hunting has been around for 2 years, has 500 thousand words, features dual protagonists and host of visceral imagery without being overbearing, yet it never gets discussed, its chapter releases go unmarked and uncelebrated.  Something else always seems to be more important to discuss, like the latest chapter of PH, or any number of fanarts made of it. Its almost like our community isnt about creators anymore, like it used to be, writers all talking and bouncing ideas off each other, writing, reading each others stories. Now its all PH and eerie silence. What happens when PH finishes? Do its thousands of fans collectively say 'whelp theres nothing good to read anymore, this fandom is dead' and leave? Or do they actually take the time out of their day to look at other prominent but unappreciated works.  Is it worth being a part of this community? Or is it now completely dead to original work and just a shrine to the have beens? Is the only way to participate and be acknowledged to draw blackjack?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,4,Mon May 4 13:07:35 2015 UTC,"Looking at the story's Fimfic page, it's not doing that badly. The only stories that really break out of the 150-300 likes box are the outliers. The big five and a handful of others.  Maybe this is just me, but I don't think focussing on external factors like the big-ness of PH is going to help you. They're just that: external. Instead of trying to move mountains, concentrate on what's within your power. Hang out with other writers that read. Stay engaged with the fans you do have. Improve your craft. Even if you think you're good at writing, improve more. It's a lot more rewarding than banging your head on an internet wall.  If attention is what you're after, which I don't think there's anything wrong with, then the FoE ship might have sailed. To reliably catch an audience you need to bank hard on a few factors that make getting into and sharing it quite easy (brevity, novelty, familiarity), and you need to be kinda lucky anyway. You also need to be aware of the context for your work without getting distracted by how successful other things are.  So that's it. Decide what's important to you: community or audience. Shooting for both is hard, and shooting at giants takes your time and energy away from both."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,CaptainHoers,1 point,Mon May 4 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"Its not doing badly at all, but as far as this subreddit goes it might as well not exist. Thats what I mean, its not a bad story, it is actually good, but being good isnt enough to participate here.  I used to post vectors of the notable characters here too, which can be found on gunbucks, even art and good likes isnt enough to be visible here. We used to post our blurb along with every chapter release and try to start conversation with leading questions in our chapter threads, to equally little effect.  I fear you are right that this community is now closed to anything but the allowed, community approved content barring any superhuman feats of originality.  edit: oh and as for hanging out with other authors, we used to, we're not welcome anymore because we feel eclipsed and destined to mediocrity through no fault of our own."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,4,Mon May 4 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"So... make a thread and talk about Treasure Hunting.  I know Hnetu would deeply appreciate it.  If you think it should be discussed, then discuss it.  If you show passion and interest in something, then others will too.  Sorry, I know I promised to stay quiet but it's hard!  ::Whines.::"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,5,Mon May 4 13:25:41 2015 UTC,You do have some excellent guidance you can provide.  You just need to not take some of the more biased/intentionally-confrontational posts personally.  This comment is an excellent example of positive and constructive criticism.
falloutequestria,34q7zf,JadedPony,2,Mon May 4 13:37:14 2015 UTC,"There's our chapter thread right there and its sad to say it only has double its usual input because of the recent drama. And then 6 months ago there was this poignant discussion about the state of things too where everything erupting today can be seen brewing then.  Noone wants to discuss anything other than your story and a scant couple of others, and the last time we said that, well we havent been welcome back since, all because we were not permitted to even acknowledge the sad state of things because it was 'bashing somber' to say that its impossible to compete with the train that never stops (back then no ending was in sight).  Hell there was even our Gunbucks site we tried, but still never any talk, never any recognition beyond some 800 foe word prologue written in 2013 and abandoned since. We dont appear to meet the worthy level and at one third the length of your epic our only hope is that somehow things will change when there isnt a monthly PH discussion thread getting 20x as much activity as anything else here."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Failoe,7,Mon May 4 13:56:57 2015 UTC,"We did try to garner more support for the fics that aren't the ""big"" ones.  In fact, I took a suggestion of yours from that thread and brought on /u/2wotoned to help implement it.  We want more attention going to authors who are otherwise drowned out by the behemoths.  That is why we have Monthly Side-fic Recommendation threads that disallow those fics.  The problem is that the viewership of this subreddit either does not participate in discussion or they are only participate in the ""primary"" one.  We average 8500 unique visitors/30k pageviews a month, and yet the majority of discussion participants are either authors or avid fans of PH.  This tells me a couple of things:    The majority of traffic comes from non-participants in discussion The people who do participate in chapter discussions are majorly consumers of fanfics or authors/""analysts"" who are there to tear it apart. The majority of fanfic readers read ""the big one(s)"" and hardly anything else.    If I were to speculate why, it would be because the majority of people who find their way in here are already reddit users, and they aren't here to specifically find and read fics.  They're here to share their love of FOE, and to them, it seems PH carries the torch of the original because how long and epic it is.  On the other hand, places like Fimfiction are specifically geared for an audience of readers, and that is where you will get the most of your discussion.  It's a site-culture thing when you break it all down.  It may be Somber's fault for responding as he has to criticism, but it isn't his fault that his story took off.  If you are to blame anyone, it should be the FOE-fic readers in general.  Even then, not every story's premise is going to be interesting for a majority of people to even begin reading.  At the end of the day, hating someone simply because his fic is big is like shooting yourself in the foot.  When PH is done and over, what happens when a massive hole is torn in fabric of the fandom?  Other stories get sucked in to fill the void.  I highly doubt, as much as the Debbie Downers lurking around might argue, that with PH's closing so too will the fandom be.  What if your fic fills a big chunk of the void?  Would you not find it hypocritical to have judged Somber for writing a story people enjoyed?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,WeAreBorgPony,1 point,Mon May 4 17:34:25 2015 UTC,I checked out the wiki for Treasure hunting and I'll give it a try but you may want to request the art be changed a little on the wiki entry.   It kinda makes it look like you shouldn't get too emotionally invested in the main characters... Image related.  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19100276/Spoilers_Much.png
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Hnetu,5,Tue May 12 17:26:59 2015 UTC,Horizons isn't the first and won't be the last foe fic I'll read. I've been waiting for you to finish this thing for years and I'm glad you've kept at it. Thanks for the ride.
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,3,Sun May 3 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"Hello, I don't get to reddit much but my friend, the4thAggie told me of your plight. I'm the Associate Director of Ponyville Live and enjoy what the FoE community has created. I spoke to my friend Seth of Equestria Daily a few minutes ago and I talked him into a plan I hope would help.  He wants to take a new approach because your sub-fandom is a strong one with many creative people. Every 3 months EQD would like to spotlight a new FoE fic as chosen not by his pre-readers, but by yours.   Do you think this could help and grow your community?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,ArgonGlow,3,Tue May 5 21:50:03 2015 UTC,"You are a savior.  If anything, the lashing out a few of us did at Somber... As amazingly childish as it was (and now that I'm not mad, I can see that it was)... It did one great thing.  It kicked the community as a whole in the ass and got us talking about how to make things better for all of us. This is a huge step. Once every 3 months?   That's. I'm speechless ~that's not true I can't shut up about this~. Some might cry foul saying it's not enough, but compared to what we had BEFORE? It's the same as getting a terrible job after being unemployed a long time. Compared to the cash you were making, you're going great now.  Once every 3 months is perfect, it gets exposure without overloading EqD with FoE stories. Hopefully we can have a voting/suggestion thread in the future as this comes up so we can decide as a community who deserves their spot."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,2,Wed May 6 05:28:56 2015 UTC,It will help even the playing ground by giving at least some other writers the benefits afforded to the mane5. I hope and pray this goes ahead
falloutequestria,34q7zf,theweltinator,9,Wed May 6 00:29:18 2015 UTC,"Wow. I just went and sifted through some of the ""we hate Somber"" threads in your history.  I have no idea how people can be such assholes.  I think the reason Horizons gets so much attention is that it's just so goddamn long. I have never gotten the impression that it's choking out other stories at all. I've read plenty of other Fo:E stories and I agree with you on the nature of writing quality. There are some that are very good, and some that are bad. Often, it comes down to personal preference. For example, I enjoyed Shades of Grey, Guise of Chaos, and Duck and Cover, but I don't particularly care for Starlight. PH's fame has actually managed to push people away, too. I've gotten several friends into Fo:E, and when they finish the original story the ask for side stories. When I mention Horizons, the usual reaction is ""That seems a bit much, got anything shorter?""  Aside from that, I think people are way to quick to jump on the Horizons-hate bandwagon. I sort of understand why, though. The story is insanely long, and nearing its conclusion. As it has ramped up, readers' expectations got more and more set in stone. When you so callously obliterated their vision, they got angry. I think that sort of hate is terrible. It's just a story for crying out loud. A fanfiction of a fanfiction of a kids' show and a videogame. There are lots of other good Fo:E stories, and I wish people could just enjoy whatever stories they think are good without feeling the need to tear down others.   And to be honest, PH doesn't dominate this fandom. It's probably the most famous side story, but there are plenty of others. The Fo:E community sometimes seems a bit overly smug in separating themselves from the rest of pony fanfiction. There are always going to be some stories that get big and famous regardless of quality, and others that get lost and forgotten even when they're really good. As far as I'm concerned, Somber, you have nothing to apologize for."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,6,Sun May 3 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"I think it is more about the fact that we are a niche community centered around a central universe, and PH is not only the most famous, but also omnipresent. Having been there from the start and until now having always been current. Famous and ongoing.  Its always being discussed. Fallout Equestria was long, it was great and it was finished long ago, noone cries about it, PH continues on, has continued since the begining of this community all the way to the present day. It is famous for being too long and as a result being omnipresent.  Mainly it will all be better when PH is history and no longer in the headlines every single month and focus can shift to the community itself."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,the4thaggie,4,Mon May 4 00:28:00 2015 UTC,"That won't necessarily happen when PH ends, though. Depending on whether or not PH or MN7 ends first (they're both within a few chapters of the end according to their authors), there might be a huge amount of MN7 end hype for a few months while it nears it's finish. Maybe Heroes will become the hyped-up can't-wait-for-the-next-chapter fic. Or maybe a less-known story (like Outlaw) or a brand-new fic will join the new Big 6 once PH is done and people have stopped obsessing over the finale. Then again, maybe what you said will happen, and the community will end up less focused on specific, established fics and more about general FoE discussion or helping new writers start their own fics. You can't really predict these kinds of things."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,IcyShake,1 point,Mon May 4 02:22:41 2015 UTC,The main thing is that hopefully the bullying of smaller writers will stop if for no other reason than PH not being the focus anymore.
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Apophis62,1 point,Mon May 4 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the recent chapter is part 1 of 2 of the last chapter of PH.  If that is infact what happens (even with an epilouge), then PH should be over within the next few months.  God knows that Somber wants PH to be over more than all of the so-called smaller authors' complaints combined."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheShadowKick,1 point,Tue May 5 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"Part 1 of 2 of the second to last chapter, with an epilogue to be released concurrently with chapter 76. At least that's my understanding of the plan."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,9,Wed May 6 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"Nope. Insecurity, frustration, and lack of creativity is what's killing other fics. Project Horizons is a behemoth, no denying that, but any claim that it's somehow stifling creativity instead of inspiring it is ludicrous, that's not how storytelling works regardless of quality. Writers are going to write. They're going to run into situations where they feel like they can't get viewers, or that their idea can't be used because something very similar has already been done. But they write anyway. They'll spin that familiar idea into something different and wonderful. They'll work and grind away at their story, pouring hours of blood, sweat and tears until somebody notices the effort, and failing that they can take solace in the fact that they improved for their next go around.  Writers do not blame others successes for the lack of their own."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Apophis62,5,Sun May 3 17:16:17 2015 UTC,"Insecurity, frustration, and lack of creativity is what's killing other fics.   My own fic was killed by plain old lack of motivation. PH was just a thing on the periphery of my awareness back then and didn't factor in at all (although I was feeling a bit over-awed by Heroes, which was the first sidefic I read).  I don't like PH, but I'm constantly impressed with the effort Somber puts into it. The man has written more in a few years than I'll probably do in my whole lifetime and has gathered himself a dedicated audience. It's quite an achievement."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,2,Mon May 4 07:19:15 2015 UTC,"lack of creativity? maybe in some cases, but definitely not all.  Frustration, hell yes. I mean well written, committed and ongoing stories longer than 100k going unnoticed and undiscussed in public? Yeah thats frustrating.  You should not blame others for feeling demoralized however, given how unsupportive this place is to non-mane5 writers.  Part of what always turns this into a flame war of perpetual burning hate is people trying to invalidate other peoples feelings, or straight up deny that PH draws disproportionate attention."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Apophis62,4,Mon May 4 01:42:56 2015 UTC,"I don't blame others for feeling demoralized, I urge them to set aside their reservations and continue to write. The issue is not that people are trying to invalidate opinions, or make false denials and accusations respectively, or that those writing and reading aren't supporting each other. The issue is that too much of this fandom within a fandom has turned into a petty, bickering popularity contest instead of what it should be: a place to share stories of a common interest and pursue literary improvement.    To address your final point entirely separately, I'd submit that what always turns this into a flame war is contained within your paragraph here. You claim (or imply at least) that Somber's fans bully detractors and blind themselves to the plight of lesser known creators. But wouldn't you agree that his fans likely have a similar stance on the inverse? I'd imagine a common viewpoint is that these detractors come in to nitpick and look down on something they enjoy and have invested themselves into, and then scream foul when they are pressed, claiming that they are being persecuted or slighted by the story's mere existence. What I'm saying is that it's a vicious cycle, perpetuated by neither side being willing to actually step into the shoes of the other, not to try and prove themselves right, but to understand the opposing point of view."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,LimboSystem,1 point,Mon May 4 09:59:36 2015 UTC,"I understand people dont want their favorite story to be criticised unfairly, but it seems whenever anyone tries to explain that they feel PH makes it impossible to be recognized or read they just get shouted down, as though the very concept is Heresy. Which leaves those who feel they are doomed to be ignored regardless of their skill or story rightfully feeling that it is not fair they are ignored regardless of merit, and accused of just being envious, or unskilled.  All the other side has to do is say ""hmmm well I can understand you feeling that way but keep writing im sure things will pick up"" instead of ""PH does not cause anyone to not read your fic, Fact. I read many fics, after reading PH I have 400 hours I am free to read other fics so therefore PH isnt causing your fic to not be read, no dont look at my post history full of exclusively PH activity pls""  And all the underdog writers have to do is what they are already doing, at least before it turns into a fight, voice their feelings about how impenetrable the market is (and how participation seems pointless and unwanted) with PH in it without criticizing PH as a story"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,GearBent,3,Mon May 4 11:22:01 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, I'm saying it's a two way street. Both sides are equally guilty in perpetuating the issue and are unwilling to give any ground, because then they won't win the all important internet argument. The supporters often try and shut down all criticisms, sometimes valid, sometimes not, but they try all the same. On the other side of the fence however, the detractors have a simmering anger that comes across clear as day whenever the story is discussed, and instead of just allowing people to enjoy the story they must tear it down or take shots at it in some form or fashion. Then of course the supporters jump to defend their beloved fanfic with flaring emotion instead of logic or reason, which leads the detractors to cry foul and push back with much the same state of mind.   Not to try and nitpick, but you're second paragraph pretty well encompasses what I'm trying to point out here (on both sides). It's framed from a standpoint that all of Somber's supporters are mindless drones who live and breathe his story and nothing else, and are incapable of empathy for burgeoning writers. Why? Can't both points be inverted to say essentially the same thing to the other side? It's just as easy for Project Horizons' fans to submit that all it takes is the detractors accepting that the story isn't a detriment to others, or claim that they combed though one of their search histories and found mostly bashing of the story they enjoy. Hell, there's a couple of posts in this very thread that show both of those points of view. All that's being done in either case is demanding useless concessions and finger pointing, or just throwing more fuel on the fire.  Somber wrote a story. Some people like it, others don't. That should be the end of the discussion. Instead we have massive, protracted arguments over what amounts to, as I said previously, a popularity contest."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,LimboSystem,2,Mon May 4 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"""Nope. Insecurity, frustration, and lack of creativity is what's killing other fics.""  Thanks for pointing this out. Besides a handful, it's hard to really distinguish one FoE fic from another. That's not Somber's fault, and any anger thrown his way is stemming from insecurity and frustration - like you said."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,GearBent,4,Sun May 3 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"Here's my Point of view on it:   I have a rough draft on a FoE story that I was going to write, but I haven't because a lot of the people I have discussed it with have the mentality that ""Every Fallout/MLP crossover is a FoE or Project Horizons sidefic"".    The point is, it's hard to stand out among those behemoths without making an equally long story."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,ArgonGlow,5,Sun May 3 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. By now, it's hard to not compare a new fic to one of the ""classics"" for better or worse. I think a lot of the frustration is completely valid, it's kind of just the fandom's growing pains. The current climate has sort of gone in a direction where people are obligated to follow certain conventions or lose the audience. At the same time, following the conventions dooms you to redundancy. It's a tough line to tow, I'm sure."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,3,Sun May 3 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's why I only have a rough draft.  Maybe something drastic like Fallout 4 can stir things up."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,mego-pie,2,Sun May 3 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that when ""Fallout"" and ""pony"" are mentioned in the same sentence, people usually assume a connection to Fo:E, but Kkat isn't the only one to cross them over on their own. For an example, see Wandering Moon."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,1 point,Mon May 4 01:53:57 2015 UTC,"Insecurity and frustration? I know a story that is 1/3rd the length of PH, ongoing, not on hiatus with good characters and story, that doesnt get even a peep of community engagement, no talk, no art, no discussion, nothing. Surely such a fic of such size would get some attention.  Maybe we are looking at it from opposite ends, you are saying that PH doesnt stifle a writers ability to write, and I am saying that it does apparently stifle a writers ability to be read"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,ArgonGlow,4,Mon May 4 04:57:46 2015 UTC,"i don't think it's that peoples fics are being crowded out.  i think that there are a bunch of people who come in after reading such great stories and decide to write their own then get a few pages or chapters, realize that their work isn't on par with what they've read and get demoralized then quit. some do keep going and end up making complete and good fics but the rate of attrition is insane.   some people want to have their work acknowledged as good and hope their stories become popular and when they aren't and don't they get frustrated.  The SCP Foundation(a collaborative writing wiki) has tons and tons and tons of experience with this kind of stuff and have pages and pages and pages ... i mean siriosuly just look at all these pages about this!  i feel like we would do very well to have some pages like this for our fandom as well as a structured and critical system for submitting stories to the community."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,6,Sun May 3 18:20:43 2015 UTC,"Your theory works for subpar writing, but it doesnt really work when applied to worthy works, writing that is actually good, not disliked, just ignored.  I appreciate that some people who feel eclipsed by PH may be not great writers, but I know that the good writers are in just the same position of being here, but ignored in favor of 'whats happening in PH this month?'"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheShadowKick,3,Mon May 4 01:34:51 2015 UTC,"For me, it's kind of the opposite. A new chapter of PH will bring me running back to this subreddit, and to this sub-fandom. After I finish the chapter my interest in Fo:E remains, and I look for another sidestory to read. If anything, PH gets me to read more stories when I would have simply forgotten about Fo:E for months."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Hnetu,3,Mon May 4 02:20:42 2015 UTC,"I see people saying that PH holding their attention here helps growing fics, but I dont see these people actually talking or posting about other fics, and their post histories are usually dominated by PH, as though nothing else is worth talking about, even if other things are being read.  I just wonder whether this place will become a discussionless ghosttown when there are no more PH chapter discussions, or whether people will start supporting other works.  Either way, we shall see soon"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheShadowKick,4,Mon May 4 05:01:53 2015 UTC,"as though nothing else is worth talking about, even if other things are being read.   This is an important point. Even if these people are going off and reading other fics, they aren't then giving those fics the exposure they give to PH. New people coming into the sub see PH this and PH that and naturally gravitate towards PH because they just aren't hearing about the other stories."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Hnetu,3,Mon May 4 07:23:20 2015 UTC,"This is something I pointed out before. There's a massive positive feedback loop for PH, and honestly even a negative feedback loop by the detractors.  People see talk of PH, art of PH, emotes of PH, music about PH, etcetc and whether good or bad, if they want to be a part of the FOE conversation, they need to be up to date on it (or at least up to date enough to decide if they love or hate it.) So we see a PH thread that has 50 comments, and another story, any story, who's posted an updated chapter and there's 3 or 5 comments.  We're already an insular community where it's difficult to get fresh blood because EqD (which is admittedly the biggest place to get new readers) doesn't allow FoE stories because reasons. So we need people to actively talk about other stories, I agree with other posters that we need AMAs from other writers to get talks going.  PH can keep it's feedback loop, it's earned it over time (love or hate it), but others need it too. PH deserves to be read by those who want to read it, but other stories deserve a chance too. We as a community need to spin that wheel for everyone else."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheShadowKick,3,Tue May 5 06:01:13 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with PH having its feedback loop. Well all want that for our stories and I applaud Somber for achieving it.  What's really needed is an EqD-like source that focuses on FoE stories. Pretty sure our fandom is large enough to give a dedicated blog content, but I don't know if anyone has the time, willingness, and ability to upkeep such a thing."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Hnetu,3,Tue May 5 07:23:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't say PH having a feedback loop is a bad thing, I just said that it's a shame others don't get the same thing. We have so many people who have said, ""PH only updates once a month, I have plenty of time for other stories!"" but... there's no discussion of them. Even if those stories are being read, there's no visibility to it, and that's where the problem lies.  We all need feedback loops...  Honestly, we need more back and forth with authors. Take the currently scheduled AMA. Bris is awesome. He is, straight up. BUT.... Art pieces, unless a long-running comic, are generally stand alone. If you update once a day or once a year, it's usually a piece that's designed to stand on it's own without being propped up by a prior piece or a followup piece.  With a story, there's a plot to follow, character building, world building, pacing, the underlying 'why X thing happened at Y time that the author knows but the characters don't and therefore it hasn't been revealed to the readers' but it's the strings that hold the story together. (My story, Treasure Hunting is a good example because there's a lot behind the scenes that Hidden, as a limited-perspective narrator, simple hasn't learned about yet. Thus the reveal will be a nice 'twist' [To use the term loosely]) and I feel like... If we had author AMAs, we could use them to workshop and help writers who need it. It would help to keep newer writers from making the same mistakes I've made, or Kkat made, or Tofu made, or Somber made. (Names pulled at random for the sake of both big and small fics).   So that we can offer advice on story-building in a single place. Because we all know that the FOEWriters subreddit is an underused utility.  Something like that, to allow massive networking with both other authors, aspiring authors, and our readers? It would make a difference, I feel.  And yes, an EqD that accepts FOE stories would be a massive boon to our shrinking community."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,KrootLoops,3,Tue May 5 08:06:23 2015 UTC,"Damn, all this discussion is making me want to start writing again.  I think we agree on the subject of PH's feedback loop. It exists, it's fine, PH has a good thing going for it.  More author AMAs sounds good for getting some exposure out there, but I still think we need some resource for new authors to get a moment in the spotlight, in the hopes that they'll draw their own crowd of readers who talk excitedly and set off a feedback loop of their own. I don't know if AMAs will help with that, people usually want to hear those from someone they already know.  Workshopping and helping writers is always great, but it doesn't help much with exposure. Networking with other authors is great too. But it's the readers that they need to connect with to solve the problem we're discussing here."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Hnetu,3,Tue May 5 08:54:03 2015 UTC,"It's more a matter of kickstarting the feedback loop. Having a name right in your face and having talks about that sort of thing will, hopefully, have a similar effect to the one I mentioned before.  If people are talking about new author and their story (specifically both, or at LEAST the story itself) it will encourage others to read said story so they can be a part of that talking. Which will get more readers to be in the loop, which will get more readers to be in the loop, which- ad naseum."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,1 point,Tue May 5 09:10:26 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with what kinds/quality of stories are accepted on EqD?  I see a problem with trying to argue against the compilation post because there is a literal clusterfuck of FOE sidefics.  Is there a happy compromise of a handful of stories I can present to EqD?  Or maybe we try for a monthly post featuring a handful of stories?  I'm sure EqD will be receptive to me (I work with a few of them regularly), but I need something more realistic than ""please accept every FOE fic to have its own post"".    As bad as that sounds (and I know it does), the fact remains that we are a niche community, and EqD caters to much more than us."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,mego-pie,2,Tue May 5 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"I know that DoctorHam (Wasteland Economics) submitted to EqD quite some time ago. He was first accepted, and then a week later he received a message that amounted to: ""Never mind, it's too violent. As the primary hub of the pony fandom, we like to keep it as family friendly as possible.""  As for me, I once submitted my own fic Outlaw after seeing this.  Please make note of this one line in particular:   We are slowly opening up Fallout Equestria submissions once again now that the new pre-reader system has opened up the free time a bit.   I was rejected with a form letter and asked to contact several editing groups before resubmitting. I did so, and not only was my writing found to have no serious faults, but I was given exceptional praise as to its quality. I sent an email asking about the submission of FoE fics to Seth personally, to which he responded: ""I'll talk to them, sometimes they're slow getting the news lol""  Since then, me and several of my fellow authors have made submissions and gotten nothing but form letters in return. I can all but guarantee they don't read the fics. More than likely they take the FiMFiction approach, see ""oh, another FoE sidestory?"" and shoot off a form rejection letter.  I dunno what you could do to change their minds, but if you could we'd all thank you."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheShadowKick,2,Tue May 5 20:59:00 2015 UTC,"The problem is that EqD decided, for who knows what reason, that they wanted to be 'family friendly' and cut out anything that wasn't. Now, this is a laudable goal, given the fact that it is a children's show at heart and they want to make sure they're getting the biggest audience they can without offending anyone.  I... It's a weird clusterfuck. They accepted FOE, PH, Heroes, and Pink Eyes before this little rule went into effect and they're grandfathered in. It makes sense, as frustrating as it is for new writers, but y'know, what can you do. The problem came around... when this was posted last May. http://www.equestriadaily.com/2014/05/story-twenty-minutes-fallout-equestria.html  It contained this bit of description text:  We are slowly opening up Fallout Equestria submissions once again now that the new pre-reader system has opened up the free time a bit. Have one of those now, a complete one at that!   So of course, the majority of us authors who had stories that we wanted to get posted threw our stories at them.... And were summarily rejected.  I actually have the email still. (I'm a hoarder.)   ""Dear Hnetu,  Thank you for submitting your story for Equestria Daily. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it for posting at this time. Though the pre-readers are no longer providing specific feedback to most submissions, I recommend you consult our Editor's Omnibus for information on the common storytelling faults we see. It also provides links to editing and proofreading resources you can pursue on your own, too.  Unfortunately I don't see a way you can make this story work with EqD's new policies, especially surrounding Fallout: Equestria fanfics. We have changed the rules, and those fanfics are going through the same acceptance process and scrutiny other fics would receive. This means what is an otherwise good tale is being rejected purely on the basis of ""too much violence"", which I do understand is a staple of the FoE stories, however has been deemed inappropriate for the site. I do not imagine you'll want to tone it down, so I am simply notifying you of the rejection and why. I wish you the best with this fiction. (For the record, fics that were passed through on the old rules will be allowed to complete their runs)  All that said, you are permitted, and encouraged, to try and put this in to the monthly FoE compilation post. The aforementioned rules do not apply to the compilation post, as it is separate from us Pre-readers here.  Pre-Reader <nAme reDacTed>""  It's the most drastic form of legalese bullshit an amateur can spit out. ""We're not giving specific feedback"" easily translates to ""No one bothered to read it because we know it's FOE and will have violence."" And if you ask Ham, you'll learn that he had a similar, though much more ironically cruel, response. His story was accepted! Only to be rejected a day or two later on the same grounds.  So, as for... A happy compromise? Codepony already submits a monthly list post of every FOE story, which I'm sure you've seen. It's a massive text dump and things get buried in it. I think the only way to really REALLY compromise, if we want to see FOE stories be there, is to take ones that are either A: already staples (MN7 deserves a post goddammit.) or B: finished quality stories. Ones that people can look at and see they're not just your run of the mill 2-chapters-then-cancelled stories.  There's other problems in the works though... Tofu finished his story, then promptly took it down to rewrite it. He's submitted it though and gotten praise but no actual response. The reason we're a niche community is because there's no new blood and they have no obligation to give us a transfusion.  I... just don't know. Short of begging for a few of the longest running stories that have shown they have staying power and subtle nuance that's MORE than just violence... It feels like slamming against a brick wall.  EDIT: Tofu raised an idea... EqD does a nightly post, the one that ends their 'broadcast day' and then they do a morning post. Ignoring time zones, what if there was an FOE post late-night. Something that'd get buried the next days. Like how cable channels are allowed to play more... raunchy nonsense, after 9 or 10PM. It'd be something up overnight that would draw in readers who are looking for stuff that late, but get pushed from the 'top spot' by the GOOD MORNING post the next day?"

That general sentiment about too many to pick from with no guarantee of quality is something that affects me too.  In that regard, we kinda need to find the next ""big"" story.  The sad truth is exactly as you say, and having something to fill the hole left by PH and FOE and others needs to be found."

I saw the thread as it was being fought over, let it die down, and posted it to SRD 'cause it was funny to me.  IMO, I'd be instigating if I, for example, made a post decrying Kkat for poor writing via comparison to Somber (a viewpoint that is just terrible) for the sheer purpose of making drama.

falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,0,Tue May 5 21:15:39 2015 UTC,the issue is that people who's stories aren't as popular are angry because PH is popular despite the fact that they see big issues with it's writing. personally i like it and i can look past the over-the-top-ey-ness of it all but some writers get annoyed that their work isn't as popular and have decided to blame PH because it's an easy target.

falloutequestria,34q7zf,Sumeron,1 point,Tue May 5 07:54:42 2015 UTC,"Well the argument that PH has been comfortably sitting in the spotlight to prompt this reader laxity has been done to death now.  I highly doubt the situation here (and this thread is testament that there is a situation here) would be so bad if the go-to story hadn't remained unchanged for so, so long.  PH was over long ago, would the 2 or 3 other stories Somber would have written in the mean time with his unused material have drawn and held focus? Would the Murky chapter discussion threads then be the only place people here talk?  Would the behavior of the readers be any different if they had experienced a change in focus before? If they had actually seen a popular fic end and another fic become popular?  PH has stubbornly persisted, for 4 long years, being the number one most focused sidefic, and the people here have likewise become stubborn and afraid of change away from PH being the only reason we gather here.  Like I said, noone is angry at Pink Eyes, or Murky or Heroes for sitting on focus, it is singularly, only, PH and its length, and the stagnation caused by it being the unchanging only reason to interact here, that causes it to be blamed. It is unnecessarily long, by Sombers own admission it should not be even half as long, it should not have been permanently tattooed on the community as that is whats hot this month, and next month, and next month etc etc for more than 4 years. The length of PH and the duration of its focus are Sombers fault. The length of PH, and the effect it has had on this place looking exactly the same any time anyone comes here (only one thread having double digit comments, and that being the PH chapter discussion thread) as a direct result of Somber's self-admitted misjudgement is somber's and PH's fault.  Eat the same food every day for 4 years and other food seems scary and unappetizing, eat the same food for 2 years and maybe just maybe you'd be willing to try something else.  PH has persisted, unnecessarily, obnoxiously, indecently, for so long it has become habit forming.  Do you blame the cigarettes or the smokers, of course we blame the smokers, but we also try to help them, we try to protect them from cigarettes and we try to encourage responsible use.  The state of this place right now is irresponsible, out of control, chainsmoking instead of eating problem."

falloutequestria,34q7zf,Derpmind,6,Wed May 6 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts on the matter as a long-time fan of FOE (I've been reading FOE since KKat was still putting out chapters):  There are a ton of well-written and interesting stories in this subfandom.  There are also a lot of incomplete or hopelessly canceled stories.  As a reader with limited time, I have to pick stories that are both interesting and seemingly active/viable for me to invest my time in.  A large and active story like PH dominates my interest not just because it's ""the big thing"".  I love world building, details, politics, and complexity.  At no point does it seem boring.  Even if PH wasn't as complex as it is, I can only juggle 1-2 incomplete stories at a time.  Completed stories are different.  I can load them up onto my Kindle and knock them out easy.  I love reading start to finish without waiting for updates.  Even some of my close friends are hesitant to read PH until it is done.    As a reader, (especially one who is as busy as I am), authors are competing for my time.  It's not Somber's fault that I was sucked into it.  PH was there for me when a hole was created at the ending of the original.  It's not Somber's fault that I was captivated by his main character.  It just so happens Blackjack and I share similar personalities, and I can identify more to her than any other character.  Here's the real kicker:  I've been let down so many times by fanfics that never complete, that I have to pick my incomplete stories carefully.  So the best thing you can do for someone like me is to finish your story."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,TheShadowKick,3,Wed May 6 01:22:56 2015 UTC,"The fact that Project Horizons is still going and actively being read (and written) is important for me when picking something to read. I'm currently up to date on the story and eagerly awaiting to read the next chapter, but that doesn't stop me from reading other stories in the mean time. Sure there's a lot of fics there but when I choose to read one I prefer to either pick one that's been completed or one which is actively being written. If I see something like: ""Last update 12 march 2013"" I won't even bother unless the story is complete, as it will just leave a void when you get to the current chapter. The promise that Horizons will finish is also good, because every story needs an end, no matter how sad.   That aside, you might've said things you regret but I don't really follow the drama outside of the story, so all I can say is: Keep on writing, it's one hell of a story to read, and an emotional rollercoaster as well. Sure it's not perfect, but perfection is boring."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,E-Squid,5,Mon May 4 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"It would help if people would be allowed to feel that they have been overshadowed by PH without being outright attacked and their feelings called invalid.  It would help if people who feel PH is impossible to compete against while it is still ongoing were not straight up bullied out of the community by people simply unable to accept the possibility that people feel that way.  PH is huge, it has always been there and a year ago it looked like it would always be there, constant, unending, given opportunity and advantage no other fic writer could hope for.   Maybe the little abandoned fics hurt us all too, but I dont see this place flooded with noname beginner fics, i dont see that happening anywhere.   I see the previous month of posts here, of all the chapter releases for non-PH stories combined having fewer than half as many comments as the latest monthly PH chapter discussion threads.  So yeah, thanks for the apology, you really acted like a douche and got what you deserved for it, but it would be handy if both you and your fans didnt attack anyone who feels eclipsed and unnoticed in your shadow."

falloutequestria,34q7zf,E-Squid,4,Mon May 4 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"My issue with PH is the precedent it sets for other fics. PH is full of things that don't fit in with the rest of FoE, like the cybernetics. Other fics have done cybernetics, sure. But in the original fic they were incredibly rare, coming from one stable that developed them over 100+ years of dedicated study. Heroes has cybernetics, but they are a much more realistic version of them, imo. Shitty, clunky, and only really there for necessity.   I could go on about other canon conflicts PH has with FoE, (especially the sex with Littlepip, wtf was with that) but tbh most of them have been discussed to death. This image springs to mind, even though it's satirical there is a lump of truth in there.  Somber, IIRC you once said that PH should have been a standalone cyberpunk fic instead of FoE based. Maybe that would have been for the best, for everyone."

The Enclave and the Zebra lands both have plenty hinted at but not much explored. Besides that, there are tons of other FoE fics that invent some of their own magic/tech or locations so they have an excuse to put in stuff that wasn't in the original. Really, if an author wants to add stuff that contradicts cannon in their Fan Fiction, what's the harm?  (And the sex with Littlepip was halfway implied and halfway just a joke.)"

Especially the sex. I like the sex. Barbie-doll characters with no sex drive are boring. Sex is a part of life, a glorious, wet, sticky, joyous part of life. Deal with it.   As to the original question, no PH isn't killing other fan fictions. The things that are killing other fanfictions are a lack of any way of knowing which ones are worth reading, which ones are shit, of having a resource which lets you identify the FOE ones vs all the other FIMfiction stories easily and a lack of story reviews.   Look at Amazon, they have a review system, a rating system and a synopsis for each product and that is what people do to when they are looking for a good book to read. People want to know what they are getting into before they invest a lot of time and emotion into a story.   Also people want to know that the story will be finished. Nothing pisses off readers more than a work of fiction that builds to a climax and never completes or goes off the rails and abandons what it was in the beginning for something new like PH is doing now with all the main characters being killed off and Blackjack becoming the new Lady-Jesus.   The entire book has been story after story about how not working with your friends lead to horrible things happening and now the main character's friends are mostly dead or missing so she is left to do everything alone... sigh.   If we had a good site with a review system I would give PH a 4 out of 5 with the note: Great fic, fun, sexy, well constructed, layered, thought provoking and deeply emotional. Well worth the read until chapter 72. Stop reading there and make up your own ending because the story just loses it at that point.   We need a rating system like that which lets people know which works are worth reading and which are just crap to narrow down the field. Then people can be judged by their own works rather than EQD's choice of the month."

Could the writers just not go back in and put links to other fics they would recommend at the bottom of each chapter (New ones every chapter) so that the people reading or rereading PH would be exposed?

Really now, there is simply no way how PH could negatively affect other FOE side fics unless they are actually based on PH, (like a side side fic ?) because somber tends to close a lot more doors than Kkat did, but i guess in that case the author would have contacted somber anyway.  I can not see any other way in which PH could destroy other peoples writing, the whole ""ph did it at some point"" thing is just another trolling thing because almost everything has already been done before, what would have happened if people in the 50s would have said ""oh someone already invented a computer, lets just not tamper with it then"".   It is no shame to follow some footsteps until you reach a point where you can leave own marks, hell sometimes you even don't know that something has been done before and you just figure it out later but that doesn't make your work bad, especially not if it is a story.  Everyone has their way to tell a story and good stories will gather fans over time, you won't have a huge fan base over night but the longer your story exists the more people will read it and if it is good they will tell others.   Only the writer(s) have to believe that a story is good, everyone else will read it and decide if they agree or not, but if the writer of a story is too insecure it is unfair and outright stupid to blame others for their own issues."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,sk2150ad,-1,Mon May 4 06:49:22 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware there was any friction in the community about PH stifling other fics (whether true or not) until now. For my part, smaller or lesser known fics are probably going to be read by me.   I love the Fallout: Equestria universe. I plan on reading other stories set in that universe not because of how big or popular the stories are, but because I love seeing various takes on the setting.   I believe that anyone who feels that their fic isn't getting read or isn't reaching the level of notoriety of the original, blaming it on more popular fics, is being silly and salty.   Of course it hasn't reached the level of original FO:E or PH. Those have been established as the bedrock. New fics have to build upon that.  To get exposure they need to have a compelling story.   Also I believe that once PH is finished it will motivate people to find other fallout stories to read. And they will have a lot of fics to choose from. So I wouldn't say PH is a negative on the fallout Equestria community at all."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,5,Mon May 4 00:29:36 2015 UTC,"If PH doesnt stifle interest in other stories then when it finishes nothing will change, ignored stories will continue to be ignored and the community will flicker out.  If PH does stifle interest in other stories then it finishing will be a boon to struggling authors trying to be noticed, and it would also make feelings of being overshadowed by PH actually valid as well as the sentiment that PH ending will be good for the community."
falloutequestria,34q7zf,Artificecoyote,5,Mon May 4 03:38:35 2015 UTC,We won't know until it's done.   Personally I'll be sad to see the end since I love the story and characters but if it reinvigorates writers and makes new and exciting stuff available then awesome.
falloutequestria,34q7zf,4fffs,2,Mon May 4 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"I think it is disingenuous to suggest the only people who feel their work extinguished by PH want to 'reach the level of notoriety of the original', thats a strawman if i ever saw one to make out that the people who feel this way must have lofty and unrealistic goals, rather than just wanting to be a part of this community.   And the reason you have not been aware of it is because usually anyone who feels unable to succeed with PH around either abandons the fandom out of hopelessness or opens their mouth and is dogpiled and bullied out for their apparent illegal feelings.  You also seem to make the argument Somber made in his murky thread tantrum, that other stories simply are not good enough if they are not getting exposure, at least thats what 'To get exposure they need to have a compelling story' reads like to me. I think there are a number of good fics out there that are compelling, but are not getting exposure, look at the monthly recommendation thread for example.  I also believe that once PH is finished its readers will flow to other stories (all this fighting started when Somber uttered the words 'And I wonder who you'll blame when I finish and people don't move on to other stories.' but thats an aside and part of his apology above). I guess the point here is that if PH finishes and its readers flow on then that does mean that those readers have been tied up all this time (the common sentiment is that PH is unfairly long, should have ended long ago and other stories written rather than shoehorning their ideas into the goliath and established story, that keeping the story going for so long has been tying up readers and stagnating the non-PH parts of the community).  I mean if PH ending is good then that does kinda imply that its at least understandable that PH having dragged out so long has been a little bad, right?"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,lordwithoutmyth,2,Mon May 4 06:45:48 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself but I'm happy to read any good FO:E story. (I'm wary of murky number 7 since I've heard it's really sad)  I've been reading PH off and on however, I think I'm at around chapter 69 or 70.   But I am confused by calling PH unfairly long. It's as long as somber wants to make it, really. It seems to me that the problem of other side fics not getting read, whether good or bad, is based on several factors.   (Note: I am not a very frequent visitor to this sub but I wanted to see what was up in this thread)  First, FoE fics don't have a good outlet. Based on what I'm reading in the comments, fimfiction isn't good for FoE stories. (That's the Mlp fanfic site I always go to for stories. But FoE, PH some of Heroes and puppy smiles I all read through EqD.)   Second, (solely based on some comments I saw here in this thread) this sub's visitors flock to PH posts and not a lot of others.   Third, it's hard to get attention to deserving fanfics since the big 5 take up so much room just by reputation alone.   The three factors above are what I feel make up the most fundamental issues I've seen in this thread. But I don't see how any of these are specifically the fault of Somber or PH.   I was iffy about his story at the beginning but I began to really like it as it got rolling. His writing improved and made me even more into the story, but without taking away from his skill, he got lucky with riding the wave of the original FoE's popularity. The timing worked out well for him to establish a viable contender for the next big FoE story after Kkat's hit. (Again I want to make it clear that I don't mean this in a way that diminishes Somber's skill, I love the story dude!)  But to address the first point, it seems like there needs to be a way to collect and store all the FoE fanfics under one roof. A site dedicated to FoE side fics perhaps, where people can go and be sure to find any and all fics.   Second point, it's up to the mods, who might benefit from community input, about how other authors can get their stuff out. (This is connected to the first point since it would be helpful to have all fics in one place so going to one story connects the reader to other similar stories)  Third, I really don't think there's an answer. It comes back, in part, to timing. Since the whole fandom was abuzz when the original came out, then interest waned a bit. Also, Perhaps the long show hiatus caused fandom interest to wane, which in turn caused a drop in FoE interest (which would feel much more significant since its a subset of the main fandom. )  As for PH 'stagnating' the community, it sounds a little salty to me. Sure PH is really fucking long, but as I said above, PH can be as long as Somber likes. Anyone is free to pursue other stories and side fics at any time. Sure there might not be a ton of readers of some side fics but that's in part to factor #1.   As to your last point about PH ending, I disagree wholeheartedly. The story can end whenever someone wants to stop reading.   I think Somber gets shit unfairly because he has the big story out now and it's easy for a lot of bad writers to blame him for not getting a lot of readers. As for writers who are good but still don't get a lot of readership, I guess that's just bad luck. But it may also be an opportunity for truly great writers to think outside the box and produce something truly special that can generate enough buzz to bring people to their story.   Hell 50 Shade of Gray became a huge deal and it was originally a fanfic of Twilight!"
falloutequestria,34q7zf,ReversedCarrot,2,Mon May 4 04:06:46 2015 UTC,I think its been said better before
falloutequestria,34q7zf,GeneralOstwind,2,Mon May 4 05:35:20 2015 UTC,"First, to address the unfairly long point. IF PH had ended 50 chapters ago, and Somber had used his ideas for other stories, all those stories and PH combined would not be as dominating as PH is today. Somber himself admits thats what he should have done, but didnt, but by inflating his already successful story with unnecessary bloat (that the author himself admits was a mistake and should have gone towards other stories) PH has persisted longer than it should have, longer than any story should have, longer than any story can compare. If PH had ended where hindsight picked it should then the problem of everyone here flocking only to the PH discussion thread would have ended long ago.  Now to your points, yes fics dont have a good outlet, apart from PH and the others that are given special prestige on EQD, a service denied indefiniatly to all other writers here.  Second, its the people, the people just want PH and nothing more, again when PH finishes this will go away, and if PH had finished when it should have then this wouldnt have been a problem for years.  Third point? I'm not sure I agree with you, noone is complaining about having to compete with Pink Eyes, and there are no Pink Eye threads that get flocked to, it is specifically a problem with PH, not the mane5. And PH gets singled out specifically for its length and the sentiment that its length is a product of milking its popularity.  Stagnation in the community is about 'lesser' writers throwing in the towel because it doesnt seem a fair system, because by all appearances the people here dont actually care about much other than PH, or so the lack of non-PH interaction here suggests.  A creator producting something FOE related that isnt related to the mane5 is basically invisible here. So they give up and leave, and become bitter. You say anyone is free to pursue other fics at any time, that may be true, but they dont, they can but they seem quite stuck to PH. Call that salt if you wish, but the numbers do show it.  As for your attitude regarding good writers who arent getting readership because of PH? Thats quite offensive, to me that sounds like 'draw blackjack or leave' not very community-like. Original creators need not apply, this universe is closed."
falloutequestria,34r4q2,Miniappolis,3,Sun May 3 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not much help with literature I'm afraid, but I'll do what I can. Sorry if I come across as harsh, this here internet doesn't allow for nuanced speech.  Although all the relevant information is all present, it reads more like a list than a natural thought process. Try putting yourself into the character's position and write what he's thinking, as it happens. Don't force exposition if it isn't required. The bit about 8 pegasi becoming 7 can be put later into the story, maybe during a sequence where time is passing.  You also have the opportunity during the description of the AP rounds to use the word 'cauterizing'.  Unfortunately there's not enough there to sink my teeth into yet to know if I'll love it, but I do look forward to more."

falloutequestria,34r4q2,SomberPony,3,Sun May 3 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"Okay.  The most important parts of a story are the first line, the first paragraph, and the first page.  FoE does this beautifully.  ""Gray.""  Just that one word summons up all kinds of feelings of gloom.  That even though LP is relatively safe, she's not happy.  This, of course, leads us to the phrase that becomes a metaphor for the entire story ""This wall needs a mural.""  And LP paints that mural all across the wasteland.  Blackjack's alarm goes off, waking her up to start her duty.  That alarm has never shut off for her.  She lives in a constant state of alarm.  Here's what I would suggest.  One paragraph of description and story, one paragraph of exposition.  Dialogue and character interaction are infinitely better than just telling us things.  Its primarily why Daisy exists in the story at all.  As far as the content goes, none of it really wowed me.  He's a pegasus... okay.  That doesn't seem to matter.  I'm not about the half.  He's a good shot with a rifle... and... that's it.  I don't have much feel for the character.  Powerful characters are boring.  They're expected to win.  Weak characters who become strong have room to grow.  Just make the rate of growth believable.  Show some training or something.  Sorry, I'm horrible at giving feedback."
falloutequestria,34r4q2,the4thaggie,2,Mon May 4 13:17:23 2015 UTC,No no that's good feedback regarding structure and how to get people attention :)   Thanks!
falloutequestria,34r4q2,the4thaggie,3,Mon May 4 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"I agree in a way.  Please note that I'm not an author, and I'm approaching critique with a sloggy mind presently (middle of the day post lunch slump).  I can't really expand on what he said since I agree to an extent.  I got the feeling that the material was a bit densely worded.  This is something I have a problem with too in day-to-day communication sometimes:  ""Also, ....."", ""Thankfully, ...."" etc.  It's fine to have a couple stewn in here and there, but they can usually be removed in the sentence.  Your sentence structure is more or less grammatically correct and used well, but the average reader is going to find the sentences a little long in the tooth.  In business, we typically try to communicate at and 8-9th grade English level.  Otherwise, the material might not be delivered effectively.    I think the biggest thing that can be done to improve the text is to make it more ""actiony"" rather than being a flat description of what's going on."

falloutequestria,34r4q2,dizziestbeef,2,Sun May 3 22:54:34 2015 UTC,"assumes position on soapbox  As the rule goes, less telling more showing.  instead of ""bullet casings scattered as far as I could see"" go for ""the ground gleamed like a field full of flowers from all the spent brass casings littering the battlefield.""  The second paragraph doesn't flow, and more stumbles about, that can be fixed by swapping a few sentences and added some better transitions.  The armor described is a little over powered as fuck, but the dashpack is a good idea.  Your main character is already sounding a bit like a mary sue, might not be.  It's really impossible to tell this early but you are circling the trap of ""im really good at X, but bad at Y, yet everyone still loves me.""  especially with the ""simple stallion"" line, Littlepip was in IT support, and Blackjack was a rent-a-cop.  Also saying that there are only 7.5 pegasi in the wasteland is tying your hands together as a writer, the common accepted idea is that there are some pegasi, but I'd be willing to bet that most readers are going to think more than 7.  The more I read, the more it sounds like your ""Allatum"" is basically unobtainium   Although not something anyone really sees as serious, typing out a number e.g. ""1"" is somewhat frowned upon, at least by me.  You're better off spelling it out.  If the wing blades are of any value, why would a band of what sounds to be intelligent raiders leave them behind, you could at least sell them.  your AP melting rounds sound similar to AP incendiary rounds, might be worth looking into.  not a necessary change though.  One big thing i see in your writing is repetition.  try not to use the same word in the same paragraph more than once, and do not use the same word twice in the same sentence, there are a few exceptions to this rule, but very few.  Lastly, something that really is just me being butthurt, .607, in inches that is into cannon range.  most rifles never go above .308, and most pistols stop at .44.  if you are talking centimeters, which is implied by you king's english spelling, calibers are measured in millimeters, so that would be .607mm, which is basically a needle, even fletches are bigger in terms of diameter.  If you did more showing, and less telling this could easily be twice as long as it stands.  If you want more specific feedback just ask.  also, go Wild."
