cosplaygirls,3e2dex,Nickvee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:45 2015 UTC,I agree there are many interpretations this cosplay is most likely based on this statue  http://hdtoytheater.com/tag/psylocke/  A lot of cosplayers like to use these statues as three dimensional references.  In fact the leg wrappings are identical....
cosplaygirls,3e2dex,Stryyder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"the whole belt thing looks like it started with Jim Lee, just based off what I browsed through."
cosplaygirls,3e2dex,hahnolo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"You know there's been a lot of interpretations of costumes by a lot of artists throughout the history of Marvel characters. Just because you like it one way doesn't mean it has to be that way every time. Just google Psylocke and flip through the first page of image results. You'll see there's equal parts hip sash and tight around the midsection.  I can't think of a single character that has only ever had one version of a costume. Furthermore, cosplayers are essentially artists. This makes it ok to change things and come up with new takes and adjusting details on characters for their own taste.  Plus, super accuracy would be boring as fuck if it were that way all the time."

cosplaygirls,3dxwc6,I-shot-Hittler,3,Mon Jul 20 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"See that's the problem, you have no passion for good cosplay. You don't care who it's supposed to be as long as there is boobs. A lot of women know this and care more about how much they show rather than the amount of effort they put into their costume.   While I love looking at tits, I can distinguish nice tits from good cosplay."
cosplaygirls,3dxwc6,philosoptical,0,Mon Jul 20 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"That is true. While I do enjoy cosplay I don't have a passion for it. What I do have a passion for is the female body tho. The way I see it most people like the image of a very attractive woman in a cute or sexy costume. I've never seen anyone go crazy for a she beast dressed at The Penguin, right? No mater how on point it was. So if a good looking/ confident woman only wants to go $30 deep at Party City with a XXS I'll stand behind that decision. At the end of the night I'll even help her take it off while the she beast can have a last man standing cage match with herself to get that penguin jumper off."

cosplaygirls,3dxvcc,Ilorin_Lorati,14,Mon Jul 20 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"They both do slutty versions, and accurate versions, of many different characters. Look at Nigri's Mad Moxxi costume. It's pretty accurate, while her Starfox one is not. Riddle does an accurate Tira and a slutty Altair.   People just hate on Nigri because she's famous. They both do slutty, accurate, and even professional (as in, paid by somebody to design/model a costume) cosplays. There's not much difference to either of them, short of one being slightly more notable than the other.   It's hipster hivemind mentality."
