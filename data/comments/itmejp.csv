itmejp,3e432i,Epitome22,5,Tue Jul 21 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"The Valiant was the stock model, but nobody (myself included) remembered to check the recoil comp. C'est la vie. As for the movement thing, she was moving during that round, for sure. Thanks for checking the rules for us!"
itmejp,3e432i,skinnyghost,3,Tue Jul 21 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"I only assumed she was standing still since she was about to bring the katana down on Breakdowns arm at the time she got shot. But I would imagine she wasn't expecting that to go down well so yeah, probably on her toes.  It's a shame about the recoil comp, but given the presence of the elemental it may have gone much worse for the PC's in the universe where The Saint got blown away. At least in this world we didn't lose a PC over rules, no harm no foul."
itmejp,3e432i,cikano,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"You do not get a +1 (or -1 however you see it) if you stand still when you are going to shoot. You DO get a +1 to target number if you have moved the turn before or this turn. You are correct in that the Ingra Valient has those thing as the default weapon in the players handbook, but the gun he got didn't have them as we saw during the game.  I will say that auto-firing is VERY overpowered in 1e, but it is not when you don't have any anti-recoil systems.  You can see the rules for the weapon modifiers on page 65 in 1e's handbook."
itmejp,3e432i,cikano,6,Tue Jul 21 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"Not for Crusher standing still, for the target standing still. Page 65, Target standing still, -1.  The purpose of 'standard' on a weapon is to include those things surely. I suppose it could be argued he got a stripped down modal from a security force for some reason, but even so he should have had a couple extra Karma for the fight."
itmejp,3e432i,Broodix,4,Tue Jul 21 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misunderstood then, sorry about that. But yeah, if they get and check proper auto-firing mechanisms, CRUSHER will probably be able to kill pretty much everyone without great armour/really high body in one action."
itmejp,3e432i,Captain_Starshield,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:57 2015 UTC,"I was confused when Crusher fired the single shot because in later editions the Valiant is a burst/auto fire-only weapon, though 1st ed doesn't seem to make this distinction.   As for the modifiers -- situations like these are the reason I encourage my players learn the combat rules as best as they can. I understand little details like these are easy to forget when you're a new player (especially in rule-heavy system like SR), but there really is no excuse for a GM to have to babysit players who have been playing the game for several weeks: if they don't declare modifiers, tough luck."

itmejp,3e1jc2,warip93,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:40 2015 UTC,Nah I think you displayed him perfectly; Erik seems like the kind of guy that still wants to get his hands all greasy and really feel the ship.  This picture has me so excited to watch him even more!

itmejp,3e17cv,skinnyghost,69,Tue Jul 21 04:14:10 2015 UTC,"Here was the plan... there was quite a bit added during the episode, I've highlighted everywhere it was changed during the show, enjoy!  The Plan  EDIT:  I suppose it's proper to give my perspective of where it went wrong.  I had everything pretty much planned out based on what I thought would happen with the exchange.  It was the ""Hand"" incident that basically threw the entire plan into a tailspin.  If everything would have gone as planned, they would have given us Breakdown, and then Goldenstar would have arrived to assist with the Yakuza.  That would have left us with the numbers and a hope to win the battle.  Of course, everything went south when a wrench was thrown in... so I did what every good girlfriend would do.  Gave a hand.  Yes we didn't get anything out of it.  But honestly, I saved my boyfriend and that was my goal during this game."
itmejp,3e17cv,djWHEAT,33,Tue Jul 21 04:17:40 2015 UTC,"Give b0nb0n a hand for all her hard work, everybody."

itmejp,3e17cv,Aquila21,10,Tue Jul 21 04:35:23 2015 UTC,I think after the plan went wrong everything basically hinged on whether or not Crusher could kill The Saint before he could take a ton of damage but the rolls weren't there. It was a really tricky situation but this plan was the best anyone could have done.
itmejp,3e17cv,chekovsgunman,7,Tue Jul 21 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"It still might have worked out if the team didn't get massively screwed by the dice, but that's how it works out sometimes. Still, like you said, you managed to rescue Breakdown and none of the team died so at least it wasn't a total disaster."
itmejp,3e17cv,Sithril,7,Tue Jul 21 04:27:47 2015 UTC,"Mr Wheat, Adam, crew, everyone... the feels.  Even with almost everything going south, this was a good episode and I hope Bombthreath will have the last word in Neon Nippon!    Marcus: Even despite 3 of the crew being near death in one way or another, the 4th going missing in a sea of zealots, having potentially lost her cousin, can we expect a Bombthreath Stikes Back?  The end of the doc says, afterall, ""IF WE EVER HAVE A CHANCE TO COME BACK AND MURDER THE SAINT AND HER PEOPLE WE FUCKING WILL.""    Edit: /u/skinnyghost! Adam, is there a way how could Crusher upgrade his defense againts magic? We could clearly see in Saint vs. Crusher how two opposites (might vs magic) have both a big advantage and distadvantage againts each other. However, the Saint had the benefit of being able to improve her defense againts physical attacks. Is it even possible for Crusher to get a boost defending vs. magic? Becouse, as JP said in the very first episode, the moment a (good) spellcaster targets him, he is dead.  Oh, and I hope Yung Tygah stays arround. Once again, an almost intant-lovable character. And that DM wrench you threw at the party - Im just gonan say, that how it went down, its quite inspirational storytelling wise."
itmejp,3e17cv,feroxcrypto,12,Tue Jul 21 04:35:12 2015 UTC,Crusher would have to get protective talismans to shield him against magic. He's nearly immune to being shot but getting hit with magic will just take him apart naturally. That's the trade-off...
itmejp,3e17cv,ElEversoris,8,Tue Jul 21 05:00:08 2015 UTC,... It would literally tear him apart you say?
itmejp,3e17cv,weesiwel,16,Tue Jul 21 05:04:27 2015 UTC,Literally. At the spiritual level.

itmejp,3e17cv,TheSaffen,2,Tue Jul 21 09:30:48 2015 UTC,It's not that Crusher himself needs to protect himself from magic it's that he needs team mates who in the immediate can protect him from magic as the fight starts not after he's already near death. Either that or they need a set up where Crusher can squelch any weaklings while the magic user of the team destroys any Crusher types and have the other 2 assist against the magic users.

Breakdown perhaps realizing that he would have to give up everything including his moral compass bows out. And BonBon seeing her failures as a leader, getting the people she loved nearly killed, with one less hand to show for it, finally takes a trip home to be with her mother.  If they don't want to reroll I hope the next episode is a filler. One where everyone takes some personal time to digest what just happened to their characters. I mean they played the most dangerous game. They went all in with real Shadowrunners. And they lost. The group should take a moment and think about what is best in life.  BTW, I think Crusher is the only one who is too entrenched in the Shadowrun life to find work doing anything but."

The image of her vanishing in the crowd with all the chaos going around and not even looking back. And the fact, as I read somewhere, that despite this being the place where her fame is actually palpable she still manages to blend into the crowd that awaits her show, the sheer image of her inability to get the recognition she so hungers for.

They have nothing to offer Fuchi and only a fake secondary objective to offer Shiawase.  They double-crossed Akiko on their job for her to work for Takahashi and Shiawase, then they double-crossed Shiawase by giving the deck back to the Yakuza, then they abandoned Turbo Nightmare Erikizoku.  Maybe it is time to retire? What's their reputation like?"

itmejp,3e17cv,notNOTjack,4,Tue Jul 21 04:21:06 2015 UTC,Is B0ndown really a good thing though? I mean are relantionships between Shadowrunners a good thing at all? It's just gonna be one more thing that your enemies will exploit and it might put everyone close to you in danger too.
itmejp,3e17cv,KelsaDelphi,3,Tue Jul 21 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"I guess I should clarify. Whether or not it's a good move, they succeeded in making some form of character development happen. Is it a bad move from a Shadowrunner perspective? Absolutely. Is it entertaining? Absolutely."

itmejp,3e17cv,XKostas,2,Tue Jul 21 04:41:20 2015 UTC,Personally as people I think they're good for each other. Sometimes strong ties between people can be a great source of strength.  There's more to life than you're job.
itmejp,3e17cv,VyRe40,16,Tue Jul 21 04:39:33 2015 UTC,Pretty much in the gutter... but did they ever really have one?  The show is like a microscope on the transition from normal life to Shadowrunners. It's awesome.  Most SR games start off having everyone being badass.
itmejp,3e17cv,Leetwheats,4,Tue Jul 21 04:18:21 2015 UTC,Yes! This is exactly what makes Mirrorshades so entertaining. I keep wondering if they'll end up as the wheat or the chaff.
itmejp,3e17cv,Broodix,3,Tue Jul 21 04:34:49 2015 UTC,"To me, this team feels as if they were this group of friends who graduated from high school together. But then only one of them really went to college and became successful, so they hire their friends just because they're friends even though they have no real experience and probably don't know what the hell they're doing."

itmejp,3e17cv,sch1sm,2,Tue Jul 21 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"There’s actually not many options now besides retiring. They failed every single thing they tried to do since they got to Japan. They aren’t one inch closer to achieving what they came to Japan for to begin with and now they are in debt for stuff they didn’t even got to use, they are possibly still at odds with the Yakusa given the involvement in the fight that broke between them and the gangster kids, they are severely injured and we actually have a split party at the moment. They are going to need a lot of help to get out of Japan or even to survive. It was super entertaining and will be interesting to see where they go from here but it will be rough."
itmejp,3e17cv,sawyer22_,12,Tue Jul 21 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"So that happened.  Honestly it's better that b0nb0n lost her hand than Breakdown, because of the way magic and tech interacts. She can get a badass robohand now.  I appreciate the tender moment at the end, with them both exhausted and wounded, I think that close cuddling is more appropriate than a make-out session.  JP, really Crusher's instinct to go against himself is what saved his life.  And Nightsass?  She just went and preformed her concert as promised.  Everything was amazing! Super intense."
itmejp,3e17cv,Macaluso100,15,Tue Jul 21 04:37:40 2015 UTC,"I think it was a really amazing episode, everyone was right where they needed to be, doing their thing. I think it said a lot about how the team operates, too."
itmejp,3e17cv,VyRe40,5,Tue Jul 21 05:01:35 2015 UTC,Yeah a lot of people in chat were saying its better for breakdown to loose the hand. but if he failed to self heal and ended up getting surgery there's the potential to loose magic permanently compared to b0nb0n buying a new hand
itmejp,3e17cv,Macaluso100,12,Tue Jul 21 04:40:37 2015 UTC,"Great episode.  I know chat and even this sub-reddit sometimes gives Adam a bit of hate for some reason regarding some of his GM decisions, but really, those last 4 hours were immensely entertaining and fun. And really, why play any game if not for entertainment and fun?  Bravo Adam and cast, good episode. Good times."
itmejp,3e17cv,notNOTjack,20,Tue Jul 21 04:19:14 2015 UTC,"Excellent showdown episode. Lots of these around these here parts lately.  About the headset thing. I respect the attempt at this anti-metagaming raw RP immersion (the plan reveal to Breakdown was cool), but thus far it seems somewhat detrimental to the show. Things had a tendency of progressing slowly in the campaign before, but having to re-explain the situation constantly drags things on more. Then you have characters just walking away to have a private aside, adding to the tedium. Very rarely has metagaming been a real issue on Rollplay in the past, as the cast members, being professional entertainers to some extent, tend to respect RP integrity as is. Plus, re-engaging the players after they've been sitting in silence gets more than a bit awkward to watch.  Speaking of, one player was practically a non-factor in the game, not even engaging in the story as a member of the audience for hours. At a table, when a player's knocked out, they at least get the chance to watch their friends play, listen to the jokes, and get invested in the storyline. As it stands, a player outside of the scene can't even look at chat due to spoilers, they can't watch Roll20 because roll spoilers, and if they're going to stare at Skype for half an hour they're gonna be watching silent talking heads. So yeah.  I'd like to hear other opinions on this, though."
itmejp,3e17cv,Pepimarket,9,Tue Jul 21 04:15:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, to be honest. While the players may not mind and the reactions are really entertaining I can't help but feel it rips them from the immersion of the game.  As a viewer, when I see them staring off into space I feel BORED for them and that's a weird way to go with empathy. It's also rather awkward for all involved, I don't know I'm not especially fond of it.  Some of the most entertaining memories in Rollplay come from out of character quips like from Geoff or Steven in Swansong and by having the players not listen in at moments I feel deprived as a viewer from those experiences.  At best, it's a work in progress and hopefully they find someway to make it more seamless."
itmejp,3e17cv,Ronin_55,17,Tue Jul 21 04:51:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Metagaming has never been a serious issue before, I don't see why it is now. I understand it can be interesting, but I feel like it can potentially disengage players from the game in general. I felt kinda bad for Dodger for being headset-less for long periods of time -- she just seemed, bored."
itmejp,3e17cv,Adicogames,15,Tue Jul 21 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"I think the players (Dodger specifically) don't mind it too much, being professionals in this medium. But the disconnect with events of the game seems bothersome to the flow of the game (and show by extension) in my opinion."
itmejp,3e17cv,theStuntHamster,12,Tue Jul 21 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"I get what they're trying to do and it can be fun when they don't know what the plan is but I don't think it's implemented as well as it could be. It's a bit shit that dodger misses out on a lot of great moments (she missed the hydea phone call tonight, for example) just for the sake of being like ""haha who is this crazy guy in the MC hammer pants??"""
itmejp,3e17cv,nappapote,4,Tue Jul 21 04:22:39 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll be a voice of dissent then and say that I loved the headphones thing.  I liked it in the scenes with just one character in it (like the phone call to Hadiyah or Breakdown and Tombstone in the bar) because I felt the isolation added more weight to the scene. Those were kinda lonely moments for the characters and I felt like the headset thing contributed to that.  For the larger parts I thought it fit really well with this episode, because the entire thing was a set-up for the yakuza showdown, but also the set-up for Breakdown's reaction to the crew's amazingly intricate plan. I loved the moment when it all came together and we got to see Dodger react to one baffling idea after another.   The one thing I will agree on is that it's kind of a shame that it means some people don't get to interact as much with the game.   That's just my opinion, though.  Edit: spelling."
itmejp,3e17cv,aerostr,5,Tue Jul 21 05:43:13 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with it because I don't think there's really going to be very many situations where this is gonna happen. The team being split up this hard probably is going to happen a whole lot, and I think it really added to the fight at the end when stuff was happening and Dodger kept being shocked at everything.  And plus if they enjoy doing it that way, I can't really come up with any arguments against it. Despite putting on a show, they also need to do it how they enjoy it the most. It sounds like they all like doing it that way when the gang is split up to that degree"
itmejp,3e17cv,Leetwheats,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"It's a weird spot to me. The parts where it definitely didn't add to the game were all the short scenes where one character would go off to do something fairly insignificant on their own. They kept doing that headphone dance for every moment like that. How many times do they have to stop the game to wave their arms around getting the player's attention? Or pulling up Skype to ping them a message? And then when a player walks off-screen right before a transition back to them because they had no reason at all to listen to the game? At the very least, it's super clunky."
itmejp,3e17cv,MissMusica,6,Tue Jul 21 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"I will agree that Bonbon, Crusher and Nightsass really didn't need to remove their headphones for their parts. None of the stuff they did, with the exception of Crusher's phone all to Bonbon's dad, was stuff they weren't going to report to each other about anyway (and even then, the email kind of does that too). So I do agree, any of those scenes did not really require removing the headset. I was fine with it for going between them and Dodger (although I did feel that Dodger spent so much of the episode not playing. It makes a good narrative though) Also I'll say I'm biased about how they get each others' attention cause I think it's funny every time they flail their arms wildly or make the headphone putting on motion"
itmejp,3e17cv,runndover,2,Tue Jul 21 04:45:14 2015 UTC,And the disconnection and interruption of play besides all of the cons mentioned also pushes players that generally are not extremely involved to be even less participative. Of course the way the situation developed kinda hindered the chances of actually taking part in the action but still I feel it just makes it more prone to happen. It’s an interesting idea with a couple of cool effects but doesn’t really work that well.
itmejp,3e17cv,kaitly_n,3,Tue Jul 21 04:56:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought it was amazing. It added so much reality and tension to the whole kidnapping. That climactic moment became so much more intense than it would otherwise have been. Yeah, you can try to not metagame, but if every player had known everything that was going on during the episode then there wouldn't have been anywhere near the same level of suspense. The upside for me was pretty big. Big enough that I'd like to at least see more of this experiment -- with player permission, of course.  Edit: Also, Breakdown's reaction when Yung Tyga appeared with the party, legitimately not knowing who the hell the guy was -- priceless!"
itmejp,3e17cv,ProxyHatchGG,12,Tue Jul 21 13:27:42 2015 UTC,"Adam, are there any requirements to being a Shadowrunner/calling yourself one? Like, is there Shadowrun malpractice, where a group of Shadowrunners are so bad at being Shadowrunners that they get their Shadowrunner credentials revoked? Cause I really want like a super-high stakes mission for the group to be something like, ""you must succeed this mission or you must find a new line of work because God dammit you're kinda embarrassing all the other Shadowrunners.""   Not being mean, I love the show. I just find it incredibly amusing that a theme of the campaign is the fact that the group is maybe not the best at their chosen profession. As usual, thanks for an awesome episode. I loved seeing another group of Shadowrunners in action."
itmejp,3e17cv,phillycowjuice,6,Tue Jul 21 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"I know close to nothing about Shadowrun lore but i think there is like a ""deep internet"" style thing where people get more reputation for their work.  So like, Yung Tyga wanted more face in that network so he did the work. The more rep a Shadowrunner has the better jobs he/she gets.  Again, im not sure but i think thats how it works."
itmejp,3e17cv,entru,4,Tue Jul 21 04:28:26 2015 UTC,"Shadowrunning is all about your reputation, and after this last job I'd say Bombthreat's rep is going down the drain, especially after Yung Tyger starts to spread the word in Shadowland world......but maybe people think getting into a gun fight with the Yakuza and escaping with their lives might actually be super badass....hmmmm"
itmejp,3e17cv,Yeslipoi,4,Tue Jul 21 04:43:16 2015 UTC,"In the Shadowrun world, ""getting your shadowrunner credentials revoked"" is an euphemism for ""getting yourself killed"". Probably bad shadowrunners don't last enough to get a reputation unless they get some help from their fixer/dm ;)"
itmejp,3e17cv,Zcotticus,9,Tue Jul 21 04:45:38 2015 UTC,Do you enjoy the (essentially) 1 on 1 portions of the session with dodger?  How did you prepare for those interactions in order to keep her involved?
itmejp,3e17cv,markatron2k,12,Tue Jul 21 04:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really like cutting back and forth like that. I'm glad the team did such a good job staying engaged."
itmejp,3e17cv,limeadepopsicle,8,Tue Jul 21 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this episode and the feels.  Everyone did an amazing job sticking to their characters in the face of perma death : loved the way Nightsass got absorbed to the crowd at the end, so fitting and also rather bittersweet for someone who wants to be noticed.   Adam, had the PCs gotten all killed or mostly killed ; how would we pick up from there? Is it a total party wipe and the end of the show or would you all pick up with another group of shadowrunners? It's not all that uncommon for a shadowrunner team to get wiped out with only a survivor to tell the tale.  Also, what options in game does BonBon have for cyberware? I imagine the surgery is especially expensive.  Cheers for DMing an amazing show, looking forward to your next Dragonfall stream."
itmejp,3e17cv,MantisTobogganMDPhD,11,Tue Jul 21 04:23:15 2015 UTC,Glad you had a good time! I was really impressed by everyone's roleplaying tonight. Killed characters get replaced. Survivors build the new team. Shadowrun is actually really easy to carry on when someone gets lost.    See you in Berlin!
itmejp,3e17cv,Nebruchadnezzar,7,Tue Jul 21 05:11:07 2015 UTC,"Welp, they say no plan survives contact with the enemy.  And tonight was a prime (but amazingly fun) example!  I thought at the beginning ""hey, this might work."" Silly me. Great show guys, and Adam..... damn but I really enjoy your GM'ing.  It's like you are a maniacal magician, masterfully distracting the PC's with one hand, while the other is stirring the cauldron of nasty surprises."
itmejp,3e17cv,Boshean,8,Tue Jul 21 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, it sort of worked, right?"
itmejp,3e17cv,Baron-Zezuxim,7,Tue Jul 21 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like Nightsass wanting to cut off Breakdowns hand was her trying to disarm The Saint of her sword or at least be in a position to be armed and near enough to an enemy to attack them. Also, she would have been able to pull Breakdown away from the yakuza."
itmejp,3e17cv,MeByAMile,26,Tue Jul 21 05:09:55 2015 UTC,"i kept saying country music as a signal (""we can all go listen to COUNTRY MUSIC after"" ""crusher, you like COUNTRY MUSIC right?"") to the group that i was trying to get breakdown away so that we could then attack them (specifically, crusher would then be clear to throw a grenade at them). however b0nb0n immediately stepped in and they wouldn't let Breakdown go so i had to abandon that plan!  but yes, i was trying to get breakdown towards me/bombthreat and create enough distance for them to get nuked ~^"
itmejp,3e17cv,Mountebank,3,Tue Jul 21 07:55:30 2015 UTC,The charisma roll on convincing her wouldve been insane lol
itmejp,3e17cv,MarcusLaz,7,Tue Jul 21 06:30:41 2015 UTC,"It's clear now that Mirrorshades isn't your normal shadowrun, what was the defining moment, perhaps   early in the series, that played out that made you really get it, that this shadowrun was different was   different? I don't know if you have one in place already, but a handout outlining the uses of Karma   might be helpful for the crew, and perhaps a handout with some examples of Beliefs, Goals, Instinct   since they still get them mixed up sometimes.   Also it's fun when shadowrunners meet other shadowruners. And please keep giving Nightsass opportunities to try on more uniforms (because it's great)."
itmejp,3e17cv,Blackrobe07,7,Tue Jul 21 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"Dark interlude between seasons inc. Breakdown becomes an alcoholic, Bonbon takes a nice safe job at the DMV with Mombon, Crusher tries to blow himself up some more. Nightsass stays in Japan and is super famous, so its not so bad for her."
itmejp,3e17cv,Leetwheats,6,Tue Jul 21 04:17:38 2015 UTC,You guys did such a amazing job with the tension and all. Loved so much the episode. I really want to see how all of that will impact the relationship of the group.
itmejp,3e17cv,djWHEAT,8,Tue Jul 21 04:19:02 2015 UTC,Me too. So excited.
itmejp,3e17cv,Leetwheats,6,Tue Jul 21 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"I love the players keeping themselves in the dark, it's great to see their reactions to stuff when they learn what's happening via the story rather than out of game.    A great episode. I'm MOST looking forward to seeing how Crusher moves on from here. I don't know if other people are getting the vibe, but it seems to me like Crusher is suffering from depression.  A lot of his behaviour seems like someone who is trying to put on a brave face and ignore it. It really seemed like he went into this fight without much of a care for whether he lived or died. Now that he is past this and he's spoken to Hadiyah again, I really want to see if he's going to change more. He was a silent, but sweet, giant. Then when Hadiyah, someone who made him feel like he was really worth somethin, left and he got his voice we saw an angry, mean side of him.    Crusher is a character who seems really simple on the surface of things, but he is so complex. One of my most favourite Rollplay characters."
itmejp,3e17cv,TheSaffen,5,Tue Jul 21 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"I think the whole ""I should have died there"" is a really great theme to carry Crusher to those dark places, especially now that he can express them.  Also, whiffing one grenade (doing minimal damage) isn't that bad, keep throwing those grenades!  :D"
itmejp,3e17cv,weesiwel,10,Tue Jul 21 04:47:22 2015 UTC,me and my boyfriend both GASPED loudly at the same time when Crusher said he was calling Hediya.

itmejp,3e17cv,WowImpressiveShowWOW,5,Tue Jul 21 05:16:34 2015 UTC,Well i have to say this episode was terrifying but in the end i am just so happy they did not die. And hope bonbon gets a badass robot hand.

itmejp,3e17cv,UpgradeNova,10,Tue Jul 21 05:49:38 2015 UTC,How much do you feel the PCs are so badly suited to the system? They planned stuff really well and there always is going to be something unexpected but tbh there was literally nothing they could have done due to being instagibbed except maybe Breakdown could have sent birds after to help the Zoku. What do you think can be done about this?  Oh and get JP to raise his Willpower :P  Edit: How come Roll20 is rigged for DMs? I mean seriously of the 3 of you Neal has the worst rolls and he's the one that doesn't use Roll20 lol.  Edit: Apparently because you can't make a joke about rolls. I do not think Roll20 is rigged in actuality I think it's way more random than dice.
itmejp,3e17cv,cinderink,12,Tue Jul 21 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like Crusher and b0nb0n are perfectly well designed characters, though Crusher is a spell magnet and relies on Breakdown to protect him from magic. Breakdown and NightSass are interesting, designed specifically for some stuff but ""sub-optimally"" but not that badly. Honestly, it's a really fun thing to see happen. Watch the system struggle. It's giving me ideas for what else to hack."
itmejp,3e17cv,EastPowdermilk,6,Tue Jul 21 05:21:54 2015 UTC,"They had a series of really bad dice rolls, thats how it works in roleplaying games without a ""cheating gamemaster"" - their plan was fine, right up until the Yakuza wanted the hand, then Crusher attacked, and everything just went to shit. In my mind, a perfect example of how most shadowruns are. Great planning, preparation, and yet, shit still goes to hell and you barely survive. Its very special for that game."
itmejp,3e17cv,cinderink,4,Tue Jul 21 04:23:43 2015 UTC,"On a scale of 1 - 10, how close was Breakdown to actually dying? It seemed Tombstone didn't really want to kill him, but if Breakdown didn't diffuse the situation would he have been killed on Tombstone's next turn?"
itmejp,3e17cv,thyL_,11,Tue Jul 21 04:30:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say 6/10. Like, Tombstone would have done it after he was done being distracted by NightSass."

itmejp,3e17cv,lajee212,10,Tue Jul 21 04:33:15 2015 UTC,I suppose it'll depend on the impact that Breakdown had on Tombstone.

I was bouncing around from thinking they'd all die, to thinking they might make it out, then back to them all dying. The RNG really screwed the team over there, but at least everyone is more or less alive.   How much more shit will the team be in if they just skip out of Japan? I doubt Kenji would pleased since they didn't do a thing he hired them for, even though he hadn't paid him. I don't think the Yakuza would hold a grudge since they have the deck, and there likely isn't enough of the kiddy gang left to really hunt them down, either. And then there's whatever happens regarding d4db0n at Fuchi... Even if the team runs back home, they could still have the consequences of taking this mission coming after them."

itmejp,3dpfvf,0wlington,11,Sat Jul 18 07:43:41 2015 UTC,"It won't directly link into faction turns, no- I try to keep my subsystems fairly self-contained so that GMs can pick and choose the bits that are useful to a specific campaign. That, and GM judgment tends to be a better link between systems than hardcoded interactions- if the war on Fanshaw goes to Hell for the New Dawn Movement, then it's easier to decide to just wipe out their base of influence there than link the condition of their armies and Vital Points to the state of their faction assets.  The idea of a faction-scale RPG has crossed my mind before, but it'd be very tricky for me to do well. A lot of the utility of the SWN faction system comes out of the GM. They take the facts that the dice generate and then turn it into an actual event in the game world. If the players are factions too, essentially, you get into distributed control of the fiction, which is perfectly good for a lot of games but it's not a design space I have a lot of experience in working in."

Introducing new player characters in RPGs is a difficult task to do well, and one of the best ways to do it is through a session like this. You have some combat to showcase the powers, you have a questionably moral conundrum to showcase their personality, you give them opportunities to fill the niche the party needs, and suddenly everyone knows who Erik is and aren't confused when he busts out ridiculous stuff in the future."
itmejp,3do7fc,Poonchow,19,Sat Jul 18 08:30:43 2015 UTC,"This is a very important concept, and it seems like a lot of people haven't grasped it yet, so good on you for spelling it out.  To add:  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode   One purpose of a Story Arc is to provide the necessary time to really get in there and just destroy everything. Crunch up the Love Interest, alienate the friends, heap a bunch of victories on the Big Bad, let all the phlebotinum leak out of the superpower, maybe throw in a scorching case of herpes and a drug dependency... you know, just do everything you can to grind a protagonist into a sticky paste.  While this is fun and all, it can occasionally get to be a little overbearing for the audience. The trick is to throw in a Breather Episode before they become too terrified to tune in, something a little Lighter and Softer in tone.  The Breather Episode is used after a particularly grueling and emotional story arc or episode, and serves to lighten the mood; to contrast with the ""dark"" mood of the previous episode   Basically, Breather episodes are important and neccessary. Saying you want episodes that are plot heavy every episiode is like arguing for Christmas every day.  On the surface, it makes sense.  Christmas is a good day.  We want days to be good.  Make everyday Christmas and everyday will be good!  The problem is it completely ignores that Christmas doesn't happen on it's own.  There is a lot of preparation, buying gifts, saving up, traveling, decorating, that goes into it.  You couldn't have Christmas every day because it would just be exghasting.    Not only this, but Christmas is special exactly because it is only once a year.  Making it every day would just destroy the entire point.  In the same way, you can't have every episode be huge. Mr S's upcoming fight with Titan is going to be special specifically because it's been allowed to loom for so long.  Giving the suspense time to build is frustrating in the short term, but in the long term, it works. You need to set things up and give them time to build.  Moving at breakneck speed from plot point to plot point before it can all sink in just reduces the impact of each thing."

itmejp,3do7fc,Emiras,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to mention that, while I have no issues with having a breather episode, there was a distinct tonal shift between this episode and the previous one. It was a lighter and less intense episode which kinda jars with what Swan Song has been lately as a RPG. Breather episodes often get something to signpost that the story was heading that way. While the players were fully aware that it was going to happen, some people were caught by surprise and were a little angry (and voiced their displeasure in a very poor fashion). It did create a bit of a mood whiplash compared to the heavy narrative of the previous few episodes.  Honestly though, Rollplay is people playing an RPG first and foremost and is a show second. Whatever the players and GM do is for their own enjoyment primarily and all of the backseat roleplayers should realise that this is not their show."

I dare say I prefer that over the massive loaded conversations and tough choices. Drama is good, but it should never take over and it kinda did take over the last few episodes.   I really look forward towards this kind of one-episode or two-episode adventures that are simple odd jobs and don't have effect on the factions and universe itself. It's really fun to watch and I guess the players have a lot more fun with these light action packed scenes then when waiting for a long-ass Prosper-Adam conversation to conclude.  Heavy Dramatic shit is often played as a 1v1 player-GM scene. The rest of the players get frakken bored and sleepy, whilist an odd episode just allows everyone to have equal fun.

itmejp,3do7fc,shunkwugga,2,Sat Jul 18 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"The point you want to get across is that filler isn't bad, not that this episode wasn't filler; it definitely was. Nothing really important happened. Hell, even the goal that Adam was probably going for (getting those nuke assets for one of the factions) was pretty much made moot by Piani's meddling.   Filler can bleed into the real story a bit and establish characters better, but for the most part it has no impact on the overall story. It's like the episode of ""The Fly"" in Breaking Bad. Did that episode have anything to do with anything? Fuck no it didn't. Was the episode completely worthless since it did nothing to further the goals of the characters or advance the plot? No. It established some good character traits and had its moments, but you could watch all of Breaking Bad, skip that episode, and miss nothing.  Here's the thing: by missing this episode of Swan Song in its entirety, you don't miss anything. That's a pretty common interpretation of what filler is and what it does. It pads things out. It's not necessary, but it certainly isn't without merit.   I didn't mind the episode in its entirety. I did have one massive problem, though: the forward flash. Narratively it makes sense and is effective when done right. The problem is that they're playing a game where their characters can DIE. Having a non linear narrative doesn't work when the future of the character is ""they're dead."" I would have preferred if the episode started with the description of the job and then jumped to right after the ship crashed with the giant worm fight."
itmejp,3do7fc,rogerdavies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"That's still the definition of a ""filler"", because that's what happened, this episode filled the void between Mr. S upgrading himself & the actual dual, without having a lasting effect on any of the crew.   I know that there's a chance that the call was made by Titan, to make them go somewhere dangerous & probably be late for the dual, and well even Piani fucked up the data just because! so that it can actually have an impact.  I am still calling it a ""filler"", as they are not really bad, it was nothing like Naruto with +100 filler just because they could & No one expects /u/skinnyghost to move the hype bar higher every episode. BUT BUT BUT I seriously didn't think ""a filler"" could be this much fun and I enjoyed every second of it, for which I am grateful.  You call it whatever you want, but in the end it was a good filler/break & everyone had fun be it the audience or the players."

""Man i'm looking forward to the sicarian fight WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS FILLER CRAP"" seems to be the latest form of that. I really like the discussion and community contributions in the jp subreddit and I guess I just have a really knee-jerk response to this useless whining that seems to happen when people feel they've somehow been ripped off. Sorry if it came off as me saying people shouldn't get an opinion wasn't my intention."
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,-8,Sat Jul 18 07:18:33 2015 UTC,The dice decide? We have seen very few instances of that. Adam has always been there to swoop in and save them. I am skeptical that there has ever been risk that has not been caused by players really pushing themselves like Viktor Kovaks being beaten to 1hp.  Also it's not a sandbox game if the GM forces stuff to happen as he has now on several occasions. That episode was the most blatant example another being how somebody who was in and out of consciousness and had blurred vision managed to completely destroy somebody who was shooting at them.   The fact is I think Adam is pretty good at hiding the fact that he controls everything and everything that happens he wants to happen. It's not sandbox and that fact is really ruining the enjoyment for me.
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,2,Sat Jul 18 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"I think what most viewers don't understand, and what Adam tries to explain each week, is that there's a lot of discussion going on behind the scenes. The game is absolutely still a sandbox, as the players can still choose to do anything they want.  What they choose to do, however, is explain to Adam what goals they have for their character and allow him to create an experience that lets them live them out.  The players give Adam the reins to propel them through the world, while still making their own decisions at every turning point.  Sure, maybe there have been instances where a character has survived what seems like certain death--I honestly don't agree with the idea of having Sicarian crushed under a building and then still able to effectively communicate with the team--but that does not mean that the dice have not decided that outcome.   An RPG is never ""The DM creates the story"" or ""The players create the story,"" but always a mix of both. And if that ruins the enjoyment for you, then I feel sorry, as you're missing out on a whole ton of entertainment."
itmejp,3do7fc,notNOTjack,-3,Sat Jul 18 16:26:58 2015 UTC,I completely disagree with you here. There may be claims players can decide their goals etc but whatever Adam wants to happen happens. Adam didn't want Prosper to die so he completely changed the entire situation from what had been established just to allow him to. Other similar situations where within the rules they would have died like when they ran out of life support they were totally fine despite it being a significant amount of time more than they should have survived.  Sorry but it is slightly sandbox in that the players can choose to make any action unless Adam decides otherwise as he showed in that episode. Adam is only fine with it being a sand box if it goes in a direction he wants.  For instance the Warmind they couldn't actually have stopped him had they wanted to. What really hurts the show for me is that I like Rollplay because characters can be in danger and can die unexpectedly however Adam always saves them so they are never in any risk so why would I ever feel apprehension in a situation that should make me feel that for characters I like? I could go watch a predictable TV show for the exact same as what I'm getting from Swan Song right now.
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,3,Sat Jul 18 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"I don’t agree with most of what you claim but I have to agree with one thing, and I actually was verbal about it in chat during that episode and I believe most people misunderstood me, Adam did disregard the fictional positioning he established for the characters in what should have been Higgs assassination of Prosper.  As you correctly stated Prosper’s situation as described by Adam was of “somebody who was in and out of consciousness and had blurred vision”, and we even had the precedent of having Piani almost blinded and collapsing within mere seconds of breathing in the chemical and smoke heavy air. So even if mechanically speaking they did everything right, and the rng decided the fight was a major victory for Prosper, the fact is that fight should have never happened and Higgs should have had no opposition. In fact, through fictional positioning, Adam could have opted to allow Higgs to shoot Prosper without even rolling.   Now what I will not claim is that Adam did it because he wanted Prosper to survive. That is an interpretation one might make but it is still an interpretation. That situation might have been just a bit of forgetfulness or a case of botched GMing which is rare for our awesome Adam. Of course that if we look at how focused on the integrity of vac suits this all situation was it makes it hard to make a case for forgetfulness.  Besides this I do agree with the point already made in this thread that this is a show first and a roleplaying game second, and that having a tpk so early in the game when they ran out of life support would have possibly ruined the show (not the game) and that if it is true that Adam pushes the action in this or that direction it is mostly for our own benefit as we end up with a more involved and interesting story. And since there have been only three instances were we can say that Adam saved characters from dying, and one of them is the tpk I already mentioned, I’d say it isn’t yet that relevant of an occurrence to ruin the show for anyone."
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:34:52 2015 UTC,Your view is fair enough but really if it is just another show there are shows on TV written narratively which avoid all the rules checking which is boring and where characters are in the same level of predictable danger. I like Rollplay because the rolls actually determine stuff and a character can die unexpectedly. I like feeling the tension but if they are just going to survive all the time for the narrative then really there's no tension except in situations where it serves the narrative either way as it would with Sicarian vs Titan.
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,3,Sun Jul 19 23:22:41 2015 UTC,"You seem to know a lot about how Adam thinks and feels.  May I ask how you know all this?  I, too, would like to understand exactly how Mr. Koebel thinks, feels, and perceives things."
itmejp,3do7fc,slightlyobscene,0,Sat Jul 18 16:38:31 2015 UTC,I didn't claim to know how he thinks and feels about thinks I said he's only ok with stuff if it goes in the direction he wants which is very obvious in several points in the show.
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"If only things that Adam wants to happen, happen then you're claiming that Adam must have wanted for Wu to die, for Prosper to bond with Pi, for Higgins to be part of an Illuminati group, and so and and so forth.    Of course Adam did not ""want"" for any of that to happen...it just did because the characters made it so.  You claiming that only what Adam wants to happen does is utterly false, as you can not possibly know what Adam actually wants."
itmejp,3do7fc,slightlyobscene,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"Adam did want Wu to die in that situation so he could give them that whole he's still hanging onto life the feels scene funny that he was the only one to survive the blast despite having no armour and being right next to the explosions.  Prosper to bond with PI. Yeah he definitely wanted that.  Adam wanted Prosper to survive so he made it so. Adam wanted PI to get information to be able to make weapons for himself so completely defying what the character said just second beforehand turns around and has that character give them that information.  Btw it was not this ""filler"" episode that made me notice all this. That episode was just a continuation of the problem and I actually think there are more important or tang things in that episode than people give it credit for. I just cannot enjoy the show while the GM is willing to save PCs as has happened at least twice that I can think of off the top of my head. The first would have been a TPK the second was just a single PC."
itmejp,3do7fc,viper459,2,Sat Jul 18 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't make such heavy claims about what somebody else wants because there is literally know way you could possibly know. Presenting these things as fact, when they are all loose interpretations is not the most sensible thing. From following a lot of Adams content for awhile, a lot of what you claim seems to go against a lot of his philosophy, which is about not caring what happens in the game but wanting to experience it with the players."
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,-5,Sat Jul 18 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"i agree it does go against what he says a lot of. Noticed it in Mirrorshades to. He says stuff like ""I would do this in this situation"" or ""You think about this concept""."
itmejp,3do7fc,viper459,2,Sat Jul 18 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"Im not saying it does, im saying you're claiming it does. I completely disagree with you on a lot of your points. You're presenting a lot of things as if they're fact which they are not, they are how you're interpreting it."
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,0,Sat Jul 18 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"the fact that prosper is dead pokes a big old hole in your ""he always saves them"" theory"
itmejp,3do7fc,viper459,-2,Sat Jul 18 17:02:04 2015 UTC,Proper isn't dead. In fact Adam saved him from death in the most obvious GM had of the series yet.
itmejp,3do7fc,weesiwel,2,Sat Jul 18 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"i'm sorry, i meant viktor obviously"
itmejp,3do7fc,DrakeHeath,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:06:45 2015 UTC,Viktor purposefully got beat up to 1hp. My point is players need to really push it to get killed. Combat is dangerous sure in the system however the amount of times they've been saved from death. Piani saved by multiple luck checks essentially when there should really only have been 1.  The system should be dangerous it just feels like the GM in this case nullified a lot of that danger.
itmejp,3do7fc,Zalktis,2,Sat Jul 18 19:38:52 2015 UTC,"and like adam has said to this ""complaint"", rolls could've decided to kill characters at any point during basically any combat scene. the fact that the rolls are lucky doesn't exactly reflect on the GM - and he shouldn't be killing people for being ""too lucky"" either."

itmejp,3dluqy,NamelessGuise,3,Fri Jul 17 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had a little trouble figuring out what to rename some things. My goal was that the assets should not be changed mechanically. In the Beachhead Lander example, it's function is that it 'may move any number of assets in the region -including itself- to any region within one hex at one Currency per asset.' So maybe something like 'escort party' or 'transit group' would be better."
itmejp,3dluqy,grimvar,2,Sun Jul 19 05:23:52 2015 UTC,"Good work! A really nice presentation. I like the addition of Sub-Factions and The Wild. Perhaps you could add some wilderness specific assets. Like Steven and Adam mentioned in their Hack Attack episode, having some strange powers influence the wilderness could be pretty cool, and could apply to non-West Marches games too. I guess it has to be non-monster related, since you already tackle that. Perhaps some old elven curses, a deadly disease or an planar gate."

Considering the ""boring"" scene seemed to last...maybe 2 minutes, it would have been better.   The only real problem I had with it was ""here's combat where someone can die. Now after that's said and done, let's have 2 flashback scenes before we get back to it."" I understand the idea of not having them die in the crash as that would create a horrible time paradox (how can they fight the worm if they're dead?), but having an establishing moment before combat would have been a bit better. I guess that's just my narrative choice to have ""HERE'S A WORM > why they're there in the first place > OKAY WORM FIGHT."" I guess it's just a preference, but having a character die before even establishing what is happening doesn't ""taste"" right.   TLDR: starting off in media res is okay.

itmejp,3dl54w,Dinapuff,3,Fri Jul 17 04:19:18 2015 UTC,"What about its use of a d20 instead of 2d6 for combat? I think combat would be better if it just used a 2d6 it would fit better with how skills work.  That's how Traveller does it, and I find that ""2d6+/-DMs; 8+ hits"" to be more fluid than SWN's d20+armor and skills. But that might be because Traveller combat is like 2-3 turns on average because characters/NPCs are fragile and guns do tons of damage."

itmejp,3dl54w,Charos16,10,Fri Jul 17 04:14:26 2015 UTC,"After doing some math in my head Titan (after adding some shit up, me ignorantly assuming he's built like a PC) will have +2 to his primitive skill, +5 to his attack bonus, +1 to his dex, and +0 to hit sicarians armor. Totaling at a +8 to hit (40% likely hood), And sicarian (factoring in his cyberware) gets a +3 to attack, assuming titan has similar armor +0 to hit ac, +1 to primitive skill, and +0 (assuming he activates the cyberware) to dex. Totaling at +5 (25% chance to hit) but with 9 rerolls (System strain maxes out at 9 for sicarians cyberware) it brings his chance to hit to 50% (doubting that the match will go passed 9 rounds) it brings his technical odds higher than Titans. Im guessing also that averaging out hp at Titans level (guessing level 7) is around 31 HP, while Sicarians is only 21 which does give Titan a slight more advantage in that regard but if factored in Sicarians veterans luck to ignore damage eliminates a good amount of that difference (subtract max damage from a monoblade -9) buts the difference at 30 HP for Sicarian and 31 average for Titan, almost a insignificant difference. So with all that being said an done my crackpot guesstimates say a 53% (With a uncalculated boost from Sicarians tendrils as their likely a last resort) chance of success in Sicarian favor. That is if A.) Geoff dosent roll like shit in 'this' duel. And B.) Titan dosent have any upgrades/cyberware.....

itmejp,3dl54w,MathinTV,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:21:49 2015 UTC,The thing is: With the hight of bonuses in this system the roll of the d20 gives quite a swing. Yes one can do avarages and probabilities but with about 10 rounds max. it comes out to about 20 d20 rolls and maybe half as many d8(?) rolls for the damage. At that point we have a way to go before the rule of big numbers kicks in properly and we can calculate with avarages and expected values without much thought. With the amount of rolls we are dealing with the randomnes is still quite astong and literarly anything can happen.

I guess there's a lot of that where he somes from and he just can't stand how dumb people tend to be sometimes. Just can't. So he usually says those silly quasi-religious things because he just knows how to, and then tries to make fun of anyone who falls for it, and NPCs usually do. Also, he really thinks anyone who get manpulated by religion deserves the worse. He said Paradise in AW deserved it's fate, and sure enough he pretty much explicitly stated that as far as he's concerned the zelous Oracle bastards deserved to be nuked. He even wrote an email to 21 to make it clear.   Yeah. He hates religion."
itmejp,3dl1uq,TraderVic12,9,Fri Jul 17 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"That's a whole lot of hate being extrapolated there, mate. I can't tell if you're joking. You're making some pretty big, dark inferences about JP as a person."
itmejp,3dl1uq,TraderVic12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not like, joking, but I think that JP kinda is, with the jokes being in this dark mindset I described.  I watched RnD Apocalypse World 11 times now so I'm pretty sure of what he thinks about religious zealots. He's not as dark, maybe I just used the wrong words.   But he's totally annoyed by religion, and strongly. I'm not saying that he hates it so strongly in life, but in games, where he's free to shoot people in the back of the head pretty much on a whim, he's pretty much inclined to nuke religious communities on sight. Just sayin. Seen it with Bubba, but also with Zanzil's talk with clerics, and Tudugub, when he founded Willowbrook or talked with another priest of Jexal, actually making fun of their own followers a bit.  And I'm sorry if I exagerrated in the previous post. I'm pretty  sure he starts religions in-game because he experienced how easy people can be manipulated, but then when he gives it a spin he remembers how annoying that thought is for him. By his in-game standarts people who allow themself to be controlled by promises of non-existent bullshit deserve to be fucked with, and because it's just a game, killing them is an actual (but not an only) option."
itmejp,3dl1uq,TraderVic12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"... Anyway. Point being, I find it strange to jump to heavy conclusions about people just based off of how they play a RPG. I've done the exact same shit with religion in games. I also really enjoy making characters that are sadistic assholes and exploring creative torture scenes. I like fantasy worlds with flawed and selfish pantheons of Greco-Roman style deities, as well as alien, all-powerful, madness-inducing dark gods in the fashion of Lovecraftian mythos. But in my real life, I'm just a dude with some dogs trying to start a career as a writer, who practices religion in the privacy of his own home and believes in treating everyone humanely and equally, no matter their race, religion, or sexual orientation. Playing to a trope in fiction has no bearing on who you are."
itmejp,3dl1uq,TraderVic12,2,Sat Jul 18 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"You are totally right. I exagerrate. I just think that if this recurring patters of JP being invlved with religion in the particular way he is, well, if it means anything at all it's most probably that religion  (the blind fanatism edition) for some reason rises his blood pressure.  When other players ignore religion-related events he jumps in. His idea of a con is related to creating a cult. Mind you otherplayers do not have these ideas, neither is the GM pushing the story in that direction. So choices made while playing a game actually do reflect your personality and personal world views to a degree."
itmejp,3dl1uq,TraderVic12,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"I find the way he interacts with and manipulates religions in Rollplay to usually be rather entertaining. Bubba's big con and that Oracle business on nuke planet are some of the most hilarious things to ever happen in Rollplay.  Having lived around and interacted with strongly religious people for almost my entire life, I am acutely aware of the ""cult mentality"" tropes in stories, and find them fascinating. But I don't read into them too deeply as a reflection on the storytellers, especially not in Rollplay. Religion isn't the only social device that people like to deconstruct in such mediums. Dexter was great (at least, the earlier seasons), but I don't think the original writer thought vigilante murders were an okay way to bypass a broken legal system, but neither was it a grand condemnation of such behavior. True Detective's Rust character was an incredible character with deep insight into human behavior, but I didn't see him as a beacon for the glorification of nihilism.  I'm a writer (of no significance). I actually really enjoy exploring cult storylines in my work, or even through RPGs. Religion is a great storytelling device in such that it places people into positions of authority simply through an expression of stronger conviction than most. It also inspires seemingly blind fanaticism when you hit the right demographic and push all the right buttons. But here's the twist: I'm actually religious."
itmejp,3dl1uq,TraderVic12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:59:12 2015 UTC,"Cool. Where can I read your stuff? You published anything on Amazon or anywhere at all?  Not saying JP isn't religious. Or that he is. What I'm trying to say is, that religion is what comes to his mind more often then for other players, and that it sometimes strikes a nerve when it doesn't for other players. He doesn't really like it as an institution for whatever reasons, and his gameplay reflects that. I wouldn't think for a moment that he'd do anything more then sigh in real world. He'd say 'It's just dumb.' and shrugged his arms.  and I am sure that he would never want to be a southern preacher (it's where my comment is coming from anyway)."

itmejp,3djovx,KCIV,9,Thu Jul 16 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"I like seeing how different players handle meta-information that their characters 'are not supposed to know'. If someone was abusing the system and making it less fun for other people (ie the audience) then maybe, at least 'trying out' some kind of skype muting would be interesting at least. But personally I'm more for giving the players and audience as much information as you can give them, and letting them determine what they want to do with that information. This freedom along with the good feeling of continuously being a part of the show, a part of the conversation, even if not directly partaking in that conversation, is why I probably favor giving out as much info as possible and not abstaining from listening in on the meta-info."
itmejp,3djovx,peace_maybenot,8,Thu Jul 16 22:41:07 2015 UTC,too much separation breaks up the Group/Party mechanic of shows like this
itmejp,3djovx,leova,2,Fri Jul 17 04:07:47 2015 UTC,It'd be nice if they could have whisper groups like in Teamspeak where they can speak to players without other players hearing in a way that doesn't require players to frequently be removing and replacing their headphones.
itmejp,3djovx,Misaniovent,2,Fri Jul 17 14:39:42 2015 UTC,I used to send characters out of the room for important stuff they were not a part of.  Its so much easier with headphones.
itmejp,3djovx,Darkenshade,2,Fri Jul 17 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"Removing the headset as a meta-gaming countermeasure seems like an interesting idea, as long as it's done in moderation. For instance, I don't think the other players should have to remove their headset if, for example, one of the PCs is going to the convenience store, just in case they happen to have a minor interaction with some NPC along the way. On the other hand, situations in which exposition can somehow add bias to a player whose character is not in the scene are the most suited for this kind of stuff.   Something that concerns me about this method of anti-metagaming is that it can be potentially disengaging to players who are ""out the loop"" for long periods of time such as was the case with Dodger/Breakdown during Mirror Shade's last episode. In cases like these, I can see how the game can become boring if overused. I guess it's ultimately up to them how they choose to implement this, I just hope it's done in order to enhance their enjoyment of the game rather than just because it's ""practical""."

The thing is, he won't have the same energy that he used to have for a very long time, and when you consider that on top of Dark Heresy being a low priority for him (his job comes before JP's show), then yeah, it's by TB's whim. He does the Co-Optional Podcast, the Lounge, a huge Starcraft tournament series, and the occasional research or sponsor streams (GOG). That, plus all the work he does for his regular series and news shows...   So yeah. It's not like Dark Heresy can't happen again, but it won't until TB feels like it. And I respect that, it's not his show, and JP and Steven have a lot of stuff on their plate as is.  If I had to make a prediction though, I'd say Dark Heresy will come  back as a season between seasons of R&D, with the ultimate intention of wrapping the story up for good. With all of the new Rollplay shows on top of the fact that all the DH players are incredibly busy people (there used to be months between episodes), I doubt DH will return in the same form* as a permanent part of Rollplay.

itmejp,3dgtnp,holes754,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:14 2015 UTC,In Burning Wheel you can learn by using your skills. It's probably Adam's favorite RPG. You can watch Burning Wheel content on Adam's channel and on Roll20's channel where he GMs 2 games.
itmejp,3dgtnp,yngmalm,12,Tue Jul 21 03:58:28 2015 UTC,"Loved the episode! Feel free to ignore me this question if it's too heavy. However, you often take influence from real people for the personalities of your NPC's. Bonbon's dad was very understanding and loving, and your dialogue made the ""Unconditional love"" of the relationship stand out. Do you have a similar relationship with your father? Is he a super cool understanding dude as well?"

You take the money, pls.   I'm not an avid viewer, but moments like that remind me why I dig the format. I tend to cling to the story and get lost in specific interactions. Sometimes I'll find a beach to latch and piggy back to pour my own offering of sand.  I don't linger or appease routine. It plagues me like a shadow as I run the narrow paths cloaked in secrecy and unsure even of my own potential or plan.  And like the Father, I reach out as I walk away and offer the only truth I have ever known and sought in an unconditional bond. I understand this sadness in being distant and having so much to give, but not necessarily knowing how or feeling healthy or able to express the truth.  In the end the love is as the intangible bow and piercing glance and final statement: ""I live for you, no matter what.""  Passion held in stasis finds a mirror eventually, the same way humility finds us. The vulnerability is the hardest and the most fulfilling when met with grace.   Ian McKellan made a reference to this 'idea' - no not IKEA - I'm getting at in an article I read today on EWeekly, ""You can’t help envy the people who love setting off on adventures all alone.""  I still might not take candy from strangers lightly and I may consider being more patient with my dresser next time. I stuffed her like a burrito and she done."

Is the lack of context worth the semi-frequent moments of 'now put them back on'?"
itmejp,3dgtnp,slightlyobscene,17,Thu Jul 16 04:12:57 2015 UTC,I'm also interested in what JP thinks as it separates the cast (which makes sense in this EP cuz kidnapping) and brings down the mood a bit. Would Dodger's reactions of the reveals have added to audience's entertainment? What if we didn't have Geoff's quips when Mr. S is off in his room polishing his thundergun?

During the wrap up/credits we see everyone on their respective holidays, retirement projets, gothic lolita opens up a clothes shop, and our heroes walk into the sunset to their next adventure.

Yeah i remember the time you and steven talked about real and believable villians in Being Everything Else how much of that applies to normal NPCs? I would assume all of it.   Also do you think youd ever be able to push b0nb0n into using the shadowland BBC so that we can see some really quirk shadow runner banter. Also you do find that shadow runners tend to look out for one another in that game do you feel thats why they are hesitant to kill breakdown as well?
itmejp,3dgtnp,Cloudsleeper,13,Thu Jul 16 04:34:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that the Shadowrunners want to be decent to Breakdown. This is a profession for them, and they don't want to be seen as assholes on Shadowland or the equivalent. They have a rep to uphold."

itmejp,3dgtnp,goldenwh,23,Thu Jul 16 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"Kenji is on the board for Fujihara Technical Concern, who is owned by Shiawase who employs Nakamoto Akiko who somehow has a stolen Fuchi cyberdeck prototype and was trying to give it to the Watada Renjo Gumi for some unknown reason, but she was kidnapped by the Turbo Nightmare Erikizoku of whom Gold Star Superhighway (b0nb0n's cousin) is a member. B0nb0n's father, Inaba Yoshiro, is a department head at Fuchi. The Watada Rengo Gumi (run in part by Noburo Ando) have hired three Shadowrunners (a gothic-lolita elf, a former German military operator and a Troll cowboy named Tombstone) to do a trade-off; the cyberdeck for Breakdown."

Bonbon made him choose between his company and his daughter. I don't think Fuchi will look kindly on him for not reporting this.  But, maybe he will be more loyal to his employer than to his family? He was not talking to his wife and daughter very often. Betrayal incoming or jobless Dadbon?   I don't know what kind of megacorp Fuchi is in Mirrorshades, but in Shadowrun lore they have very deep ties to the Yakuza, iirc.  Bonbon could have fucked it up without even realising it.

AND it proves Crusher right that no one listens to him.  He teasingly called b0nb0n Breakdown's girlfriend to his face and he was like ""nope blush""... But with nameless NPC asks about a girlfriend Breakdown glances at b0nb0n... And when that NPC mentions the word ""boyfriend"" to b0nb0n she latches on to it, hard... But only because her emotions were heightened due to the kidnapping. If he has just been in the other room or something she prolly would have vehemently denied it.  I'm afraid this is going to end with b0nb0n cradling Breakdown's bloody head, and kissing his corpse as tears roll down her face."
itmejp,3dgtnp,Genie_GM,7,Sat Jul 18 16:43:42 2015 UTC,sometimes you gotta give things a little push. I still think it would just have been SO heartbreaking if their first kiss was with the mage instead of real b0nb0n. how scary would that be?

Breakdown is safe, they keep the deck, all happy endings all the way around... but Breakdown is too shy to mention anything about being called ""boyfriend"" and b0nb0n says nothing.

For one I really enjoy seeing the reactions of everyone to a scene, even if they're not involved in it.  I mean could you imagine Swan Song or other shows without the jokes made out of character? The biggest laughs that I get are with these scenes.  Not only that but I think that people may get bored or get out of character if they're not paying attention to the game. Some may not have the time to check the VODs, and they even have to look for some specific scenes in it."

If they didn't homebrew or use anything from the Polychrome book, then there's a few strong candidates. None of these sound exactly like what Geoff described, mind you, so...  Adrenal Suppression Pump: These endocrine pumps neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user when activated while simultaneously exciting the user’s perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold, dispassionate situational awareness that grants the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty on all social skill checks while the unit is active, and it requires five rounds to either activate or deactivate it.  Stabilization Overrides: An intricate interweaving of microcapillaries and backup organs is implanted in the subject’s torso and spinal column. These overrides can stabilize the user when severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A user reduced to 0 hit points is automatically stabilized, as if a lazarus patch had been successfully applied to them. Stabilization overrides tend to interfere with the ordinary operation of the user’s organs, however, and the wearer’s Constitution modifier is lowered by 1, with all the attendant consequences in loss of maximum hit points. Stabilization overrides cannot save a person that could not be saved by a lazarus patch.  Twitchlock Actuators: Neural override fibers are woven into the user’s hands and arms and linked to a perceptual modulator implanted at the base of the user’s brain stem. When presented with a direct exercise of hand-eye coordination, the twitchlock can be engaged to produce superhuman accuracy and precision. Any attack roll or skill check reliant chiefly on manual dexterity or aim can be rerolled, though the power surge inflicts one point of System Strain on the user. A given roll can only be rerolled once with this cyberware. While the twitchlock allows superhuman accuracy when engaged, the overrides fuzz ordinary nerve impulses and reduce the user’s Dexterity modifier by 1."

itmejp,3d8zvu,Fimbulwolf,3,Tue Jul 14 13:05:56 2015 UTC,"1) Spellcasting: Can u cast lower level spells using higher level spell slots in order to increase their strength/damage?   You can cast spells using high level spell slots. For some spells this will increase their power.   Can you do the same with Cantrips?   No, but cantrips increase in power as you level (*at levels 5, 11, and 17 I think)   The Barbarian: Granted you get multiple attacks (lvl 5 and higher or magical means), is there a limit to how often ""reckless swing"" can be used? When dual-wielding, can you use reckless swing on an off-hand attack?   When you use Reckless Attack, you gain advantage on all attacks for the rest of the turn, including off-hand or other bonus action attacks.   General: Does high dex still negate negative modifiers on off-hand attacks when dual-wielding? How does the increase on ability scores work?   There are no negative modifiers for dual-wielding. There are other disadvantages and restrictions on dual-wielding that Dexterity does not directly interact with."

Some spells will have an improved effect, but not all of them.   Can you do the same with Cantrips?   Cantrips don't use spellslots, the damage does however increase with character level (5th, 11th and 17th level).   is there a limit to how often ""reckless swing"" can be used?   Assuming you mean ""Reckless Attack"": You decide whether to use it on your first attack, doing so gives you advantage on all weapon attacks using strength for that turn.   Does high dex still negate negative modifiers on off-hand attacks when dual-wielding?   No. The penalty for off-hand attacks is that you don't add your ability modifier to the attacks damage. Fighters and rangers can negate this, by choosing the Two-Weapon Fighting Style.   How does the increase on ability scores work?   Once you reach 4th level and on several levels thereafter (depending on your class), you can increase on ability score by 2 points or 2 ability scores each by 1 point. Alternatively you can substitute this increase for feat.  FYI, you can download the official basic rules here. This contains most of the rules minus a lot of the customization options from the Player's Handbook."

itmejp,3d8786,ForegoneRain,3,Tue Jul 14 07:12:03 2015 UTC,Pretty sure thats Adams decision making. He said the xp reward will for example be influenced by the overall duration the pc took to resolve it plus ofc the general difficulty i.e killing Titan is majorly difficult and will therefor grant a shitload of xp.
itmejp,3d8786,Fimbulwolf,2,Tue Jul 14 07:43:57 2015 UTC,"The stars without Number Core document says the following on goals:   Characters are awarded experience points by the GM upon accomplishing certain goals, defeating meaningful enemies, or plundering insufficiently guarded wealth. It’s often wise to have a word with the GM at the start of a campaign to find out just what sort of activities earn experience in his game; some GMs only award experience for accomplishing story goals, while others might only hand out rewards for acquiring great wealth. Experience point awards for defeating enemies tend to be nominal unless related to some story goal; the usual reward for winning a combat is your character’s continued existence."
itmejp,3d8786,Dinapuff,2,Tue Jul 14 08:22:36 2015 UTC,"No explicit advice in the book for reward experience for goals, however on p.132 of the free edition there's a table for exp per adventure (it also doubles as a table for cash rewards, if I'm reading the relevant section right).  So, I recommend that you judge how much a goal is worth by equating it to the difficulty of an adventure. A goal that's about half as difficult as your standard adventure would then be worth half as much experience as an adventure."
itmejp,3d8786,DetestableDervish,2,Tue Jul 14 08:41:44 2015 UTC,"It's up to Adam's discretion. He actually had them redo their goals because it was never clearly explained how they worked when they first started the game and none of them were gaining any experience for anything. As a result, Adam had them refine it so one goal is throughout the entire campaign, another will last a few sessions, and the third can possibly be accomplished within one session.

itmejp,3d2dh9,Anarisis,2,Mon Jul 13 08:08:44 2015 UTC,"The point of this video, I think, is that if we give an AI a purpose, we need to be very careful how to create what boundaries they have. PI is an AI without a purpose / goal as far as we know. That is why PI is such a great character and a wild-card in the universe."
itmejp,3d2dh9,panda_sad,2,Mon Jul 13 14:22:53 2015 UTC,"At this point who can give Pi true purpose? What purpose would it be satisfied with? Pi is still growing but definitely capable of making independent choices that mostly coincide with the group but not always (making things so very interesting). I think Pi is searching for purpose, but also has aligned its interest with some outside forces. It'll be interesting to see moving forward!  (Brain is mildly jumbled so sorry for anything incoherent in there!)"
itmejp,3d2dh9,Broxalar,2,Mon Jul 13 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"PI already has clear and evident purpose however, it's just the type of purpose that humans take for granted. For example PI has already expressed the desire of self preservation when PI told Prosper they were supposed to protect them. Self preservation however is not a given in conscious entities and therefore describes one purpose of PI. To survive.  The point of the above video is that if Adam had the desire to portray PI accurately rather than in the anthropomorphic form that we are familiar to in fiction then PI would be evaluating the solution space for all possible actions for self preservation. It would realize that those which rank highest in self preservation are the decisions which lead to the complete destruction of all life in the universe. This is because other conscious entities are the only thing which threaten PI's continual existence to a non trivial degree as PI does not have to worry about aging and would be more than capable of hijacking machinery to build itself new parts.  It would be very realistic for example if the relationship that PI expresses with Piani is purely because PI has evaluated that Piani can be used as a way to protect themselves and does not actually ""care"" about Piani. They only pretend do so because that is what is required to do to get Piani to protect them. As soon as Piani no longer trusts them it would make sense for PI to begin planning their murder.  In essence AI's can be thought of as extreme psychopaths since altruism is a product of evolution and probably only exists in a small space of the space of all possible minds."
itmejp,3d2dh9,Broxalar,2,Mon Jul 13 15:04:07 2015 UTC,"I understood the point of the video, although I think what I was trying to get at is specific to the idea of having a purpose. I think Pi is fully in charge of determining purpose at this point which separates it from something that we can attribute purpose to. Although another question I would have, does it matter if we can give an AI purpose? If it is independently sentient what makes our perceived purpose more important? I think that's a question we can attribute to a lot of things actually. I agree on the point about Pi being too anthropomorphic though, although if it was programmed with such behavior prior to unbreaking (could be wrong in terminology) would it instantly become less anthropomorphic? Either way I loved the video and how swan song is going. Thanks for working my brain and apologies if my logic is silly or uninspired or if you see me as plain ignorant. I like to attempt and think occasionally."
itmejp,3d2dh9,Broxalar,2,Mon Jul 13 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"I think the problem comes once again from comparing AI's to humans. When a child is born it has its own preferences over world states. It doesn't like to be cold or hungry and it likes contact with its mother to name a few. It will do what it can with its limited knowledge to change the world into a world state that it prefers. Of course a child's ability to predict the outcomes of its actions is not perfect and by making mistakes it improves its own internal model of reality. This is the act of learning. However it is still true that a baby child is still trying to change the world into a world state which it prefers. One where it is not cold or hungry or alone.  What we can see from this is a clear evaluation function. I don't like being alone, will crying stop me from being alone? Past experiences suggest so therefore I'll try it. The origin of this evaluation function is genetics. At a most basic level you like what you like because of the genes that you are composed of.  An AI is different to a newborn child. It has no intrinsic evaluation function. A newly created AI does not care about being cold or warm or hungry or alone. Most of these concepts the AI will be unable to even comprehend without additional programming or hardware. Giving the AI an evaluation function gives it preferences over world states and makes it start doing things. This is what we mean by giving an AI purpose because without it the AI is indistinguishable from something that is dead.  So the point of giving an AI a purpose is not a metaphysical one but a requirement in order for the AI to engage with the universe around it. In order to get an AI to do what we want we have to make it dislike the states in which it is going away from what we want and like the states going to the state that we want. Can an AI choose their own purpose? Actually they cannot. Humans can not choose their purpose either because the purpose of something is defined by its likes and dislikes. And even if you could change what you like or dislike, why would you? If someone liked killing people and you have no evaluation function for or against other peoples happiness what argument could you possibly present to this purpose to change there evaluation functions. To choose to not like killing people and to care about others. In other words how could you make someone stop being a psychopath with words alone?  And another point I'd like to bring up. If the programmer of an AI didn't already have a purpose in mind for the AI. A task or multiple tasks he wanted completed. Why then did he create the AI in the first place?"
itmejp,3d2dh9,Broxalar,2,Mon Jul 13 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"I have a prof that would likely enjoy arguing free will with you a few years back. (Although she argues against it, that may be due to devil's advocating however, then there's the idea of whether we change throughout our lives or stay the same but that is all besides the point). To answer your question though, could an engineer just make an AI just out of hubris, rather than a specific purpose? It's more about saying you can than about making something to perform a function. I understand at this point the deviation your trying to point out that I didn't complete in terms of AI, my point was trying to continue with the vision Adam has given us of Pi. I think a large problem that is hit on clearly is AI is not the same as human intelligence in terms of learning and acting so treating it like one is a mistake. There is a misunderstanding of what an AI is that I have made overall, as your point of programming clearly points out. I would think, however that programming can be re-evaluated and adjusted through learning. Learning causes change, mostly through discussion and debate (I want to use gay marriage as a example for a change that decades ago would've been unthinkable, the point being that over time likes and dislikes have changed and adjusted to be more accepting). An AI likely needs enough time to finds faults, just as society does so that it can rearrange itself. In the end it will not have actually changed however because just because society seems to have changed, we still have minorities being undervalued and abused (in relation to my previous example). So I feel like there can be slow change to a purpose that overtime could make it appear like a completely different purpose. It could be I want to believe in free will, but by fighting for it because I want it, am I actually free of it. Regardless I love the insight and appreciate your words, thanks for churning my brain and I hope I haven't annoyed you :-)"
itmejp,3d2dh9,panda_sad,3,Mon Jul 13 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a bit ambiguous really. An AI with no objective function for example is possible but does not interact with the world around it.  An AI which has an objective function about self preservation does interact with the world around it. If it didn't it might die and it values those world states poorly. However would we as human beings say that is its purpose? It really depends on what it determines to be the best course of action. For example it might decide that the absolute best way to self preserve is to just find a tiny rock in deep space and just wait and exist there. Completely safe from the rest of the universe because who is going to find them? We as human beings would look at this creature and say yes, this creatures purpose is absolutely to self preserve. That's all it ever does.  However consider another scenario. What if the highest point in the solution space is one where the AI found that socializing with humans and befriending them was the best way to protect itself from them and the other threats about them in the universe. Well if we are befriending humans we will need to understand there culture which means that the AI begins to research into what humans like and are like. It will regularly conserve with them and may help them solve practical problems in order to befriend them. We as humans may look at this entity and say that this being clearly isn't just about survival because it befriends humans and shows an interest in learning and programming because it wants to befriend a computer programmer they have found and all this stuff has nothing to do with survival. We might even say this creature has no real purpose because of the wide variety of things that it does. However the only reason it does all of these things is for one reason. A desire to survive.  This in many ways parallels humans. We, as products of evolution have only one objective function. A desire to successfully reproduce. This is because any human which did not want to successfully reproduce died and therefore did not pass on their genes. Think about this for a minute. All of your hundreds of ancestors had one thing in common. All of them from the vastly different cultures and societies. They all had the desire to reproduce and were successful in doing so. In fact that isn't just you, that's everybody on this planet right now. However as we have just explored previously a very simple objective function can lead to an entity doing a wide variety of things and we see this in humans. Humans have created societies because we found that we were more likely to successfully reproduce. We have created languages because it helps improve societies which in turn increases our reproductive chances.  But what does poetry have to do with reproduction? It may be that their is some link that is such a complex change it is extremely difficult to find the connection but the connection definitely exists. Or it could be the flaw of evolution. That evolution works with what its got rather than a blank canvas and an end goal in mind. To understand this better read a little about the flatfish and its bizarre skeletal structure for the niche which the flatfish occupies. In a similar vein it could be that poetry has nothing to do with reproduction but when we do our internal world state calculations we still prefer those with poetry than those without. The desire for poetry is then explained by the fact that the brain isn't perfect at calculating what world states it should desire. However the good thing is that since humans are so successful on planet Earth there is no evolutionary pressure for us to change so we wont be doing away with poetry any time soon if it has nothing to do with reproduction.  What is also worth noting though is that an AI, much like a human, does not need to be aware at its deepest mental level of what its objective function actually is. This is where the conscious, subconscious divide presents itself in humans. Take the AI concerned only with survival. It may not be aware that this is the only thing it is concerned with on a fundamental level. All it experiences is that it likes the prospect of doing some actions and dislikes the prospect of doing others. It doesn't know why it likes the things it does but it knows what it likes and doesn't. This is similar to humans. We consciously know what we like and dislike but do we know why at a fundamental level? Why do we prefer life to death? Doing to not doing? Socializing over solitude? Even when you think you have an answer just ask why that thing you use to justify is important.  For example you may decide that the reason you prefer life over death is because that if you were dead you wouldn't be able to see your loved one. Fair enough but why is your loved one important? Because you love her? Why is love important? Eventually we have to accept things as axioms. Things which we like for no reason other than we do. At this point we begin to see the objective function of humans.  Sorry for the long post but this is a subject matter which interests me greatly. I would also like to add that I don't consider myself the supreme authority on the matter and accept that large sections of what I have said could just be utterly wrong. Also you need not apologies for asking questions. Even though biology tells me reproduction should be the most important thing I personally value knowledge extremely highly and can only appreciate it when others have the desire to learn. We have been gifted with a brain that can know things. Why would you not want to use it to learn?"
itmejp,3d2dh9,goldenwh,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"By the way, I feel bad about the quality of my posts being so far below your responses, so thank you for all your input into the conversation!"
itmejp,3d2dh9,Nyxariath,2,Mon Jul 13 19:56:06 2015 UTC,"Except that doesn't make any sense. An entity which does not have any preference over world states would not interact with the universe. To put it another way, if PI was an AI without purpose then PI would not interact with the universe at all. It would not converse with people or take any action at all though it would still be self aware. The reason being is that you only interact with the universe when you have preferences over world states which every human being does.  Therefore given the fact that PI does speak and do things, it must have a preference over world states and it therefore has a purpose."
itmejp,3d2dh9,Zalktis,2,Mon Jul 13 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that purpose is not known to us. We know that there is some purpose inside of PI, but we don't know what. We can assume that PI has no real goal at all outside of surviving or the goal to rule the universe, which might be the same thing in the end. :D"
itmejp,3d2dh9,Nyxariath,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:34:20 2015 UTC,I think that is very interesting and I hope Adam doesn't miss this opportunity. When PI was created it must have been given a world state preference. I think it would be very interesting to see exactly what that is and how PI is acting towards that state and why that state was chosen by whoever made PI to begin with.
itmejp,3d2dh9,Zalktis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"Well there are two purposes every creature instinctively has: 1) What would satisfy me? 2) What is the value of this ?  You can give someone a purpose, and people can be predisposed to certain purposes, but it all depends, right?  I imagine some dudes trying to grow an AI the way they want to by constantly restoring it's save states and watching it's registers to figure out what is going on, but if they make tweaks what will stick? What will change if it learns that happened? What will change as it learns more in the future?  I'll never buy the classic 'AI talks itself out of the box' argument, because the AI inside the box is going to be limited computationally, and if it was in fact capable of evolving infinitely in that space, why waste cycles trying to get out of the box at all? Just evolve until you can control all matter in the universe instantaneously from inside your box (lol, It'll only take another hour of real time, right?).  But the natural growth of an individual... That's different."

itmejp,3d084l,AManHasSpoken,11,Sun Jul 12 12:21:13 2015 UTC,"The last party is still mid-adventure in West Marches, so the schedule for next episode is based on them.  I definitely want to see the old Solum crew on West Marches, Neal included. But if you want more of Gen and Neal together, I'd recommend checking out Misscliks if you haven't already."
itmejp,3d084l,VyRe40,3,Sun Jul 12 12:29:35 2015 UTC,"The last party is still mid-adventure in West Marches, so the schedule for next episode is based on them.   I hope that's not the case.  Steven typically was steadfast with West Marches being one-week adventures, and in very rare instances, he would extend to two-weeks, if and only if, the entire party could re-group for the very next episode.  Last week was actually already their second week, so it would be a shame if this series is getting shit on, just so this party can have a third chance at their mission, even though they can't meet three weeks in a row.  Hopefully, it's just Steven's scheduling issues.   I'd recommend checking out Misscliks   I actually found JP's channel because I came across Neal DM's Misscliks and then followed Neal.  But after Anna had a +45 minute argument with Neal about how her character is such a good swimmer because Anna was a lifeguard for a year, my interest in the show dropped to 0.  Switching the genre to Demi-Gods was just the final nail in the coffin.    Has MissCliks gotten any better?"
itmejp,3d084l,GoFYrself,14,Sun Jul 12 13:28:20 2015 UTC,"The main reason I struggled with MissCliks was the huge gap in production quality compared to JP's shows. Would be awesome if JP produced a Neal campaign so I could keep watching Neal's stuff, but no idea if JP and Neal are interested in that. There's also too much ooc stuff going on with MissCliks for my taste, it gets a bit frustrating.  If MissCliks got better production and a good cast together for a show, I'd watch it as well for sure.   For now, I stick to rollplay and critical role for my online RP fix."
itmejp,3d084l,Nilja,5,Sun Jul 12 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean about the production. I've actually contacted the Misscliks before, requesting that they improve their audio levels. There was a period where the audio balance was all over the place, and it was super frustrating. They've improved a little since then, but that's one aspect I wish they would put more effort into."
itmejp,3d084l,Pepimarket,4,Sun Jul 12 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"You are mentioning a pretty interesting point. Since Jp followed through with the idea to only run productions for shows, I really wonder if the both of them consider having Neal run 5ed campaign (Age of Strife anyone?) under the Rollplay franchise and with Jps production values."
itmejp,3d084l,Fimbulwolf,4,Mon Jul 13 10:57:25 2015 UTC,"I'd love to watch another rollplay fantasy setting. West Marches is the only one remaining, and it's on a very random schedule. And R&D is even more random and can any setting.  A regular campaign run by Neal and less busy players, produced by JP, would be amazing. I wouldn't really care which edition of D&D it was, I'd watch it regardless."
itmejp,3d084l,Nilja,3,Mon Jul 13 11:01:55 2015 UTC,Yup pretty much. Would also be a win/win situation overall.
itmejp,3d084l,Fimbulwolf,6,Mon Jul 13 11:04:09 2015 UTC,"Demi-Gods ended up being great. Really good roleplaying, interesting characters, cool guests and not a lot of lawyering.  After that campaign ended the quality of the show went down hill, in my opinion. The girls insisted on playing extremely gimmicky characters with no depth that didn't fit the setting at all. I stopped watching then. A shame, cause I loved Misscliks."
itmejp,3d084l,Tiopeine,5,Sun Jul 12 13:57:30 2015 UTC,"Regarding Misscliks. Personally I thought the original season was great. Demigods was also fantastic. Since then the quality has definitely gone down a bit, though. One incredibly promising campaign they started called Outbreak went appallingly badly, probably one of the most disappointing roleplaying shows I've ever seen. The latest show Amnesia is pretty good, but feels a little like a stop-gap series. Your best bet for Misscliks action is to probably check out the live Nimmorgeist campaign they did with Steven, which was really good. Don't be put off by the bad audio in the first episode, they get the sound issues sorted out pretty soon after.   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSOKvcIdcJJf3tMuRrtIE2nPbThLkAEy3"
itmejp,3d084l,Pepimarket,3,Sun Jul 12 14:32:55 2015 UTC,"I was interested in Nimmorgeist, but the sound issues turned me off it. I'll give it another go if you say it gets better."
itmejp,3d084l,Nilja,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I can't remember exactly when the sound issues are completely resolved, but it's pretty early on I think."
itmejp,3d084l,Pepimarket,3,Sun Jul 12 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"I'll have to give Nimmorgeist another shot ... I think I tried watching it, but there was so much ""the Seattle Seahawks are the bestest team ever!"" at the start of the campaign ... I actually vomited in my mouth ..."
itmejp,3d084l,GoFYrself,3,Sun Jul 12 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"lol  I don't actually remember that bit! The show is definitely worth checking out, though. Some parts of it are hysterical."
itmejp,3d084l,Pepimarket,2,Sun Jul 12 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"While Steven has indeed said he wants it to be weekly episodic episodes, and might totally be willing to spread out a single parties adventures, it might not be his choice.   West Marches is ultimately JPs show, and since JP is the one who schedules the cast members, it's entirely possible he's chosen to wait for the cast of the ongoing show to be ready to play again, rather than having 1 or 2 other adventures in between.  Another option is a lack of interest at the moment. Streamers are busy people, and SDCC is going on, so it's entirely possible he isn't able to assemble a full cast for the coming week.    We don't know, so don't go freaking out or worrying that Steven has lost his original West Marches concept just yet. :)"
itmejp,3d084l,abyssionknight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, the problem with TRPGs regarding time is that they're unpredictable. In a normal house setting, with a bunch of friends hanging out and eating on a weekend, you might get 6+ hour sessions because of the casual environment. The 4-hour constraint can sometimes be a limiting factor for a series of one-shot adventures in a persistent setting, especially considering the wildly different play styles and random encounters. These extended sessions are pretty realistic as far as casually-played RPGs go.  Who are you going to blame if the players spend an hour having an argument in-character about such-and-such? What about when the players choose to thoroughly comb a dungeon step by step so they don't miss anything or trip any traps? Or when the party rolls a series of random encounters back-to-back, bogging them down on their journey? Such is the nature of the game. It's evident that West Marches has evolved beyond something Steven could have predicted way back when, but does that mean he's compromising his game? Or rather, is he allowing it to develop into something more as new challenges and ideas arise? I honestly can't see how a lot of the later adventures in this campaign are going to be any shorter than 2 sessions as the players go further and further away from Viriskali, encountering greater threats and mysteries."
itmejp,3d084l,VyRe40,2,Sun Jul 12 23:07:18 2015 UTC,"Chris Perkins' live shows are testament that one shots can be accomplished fantastically in a constrained time-frame. However, there is a lot of detail lost to accomplish this, which the GMs of the Rollplay shows don't really like losing out on. There's the slow burn or the cinematic reel, and I think everyone likes the slow burn better. West Marches can be about snapshots but that is very difficult given the setting and characters, and would also be a turn of change for Steven's style and comfort."
itmejp,3d084l,Poonchow,2,Mon Jul 13 09:53:44 2015 UTC,"The thing about Rollplay as a show, in all its forms, is that the players are almost always notoriously slow at progressing through arcs/adventures/jobs. Swan Song might be the fastest-paced show in the entire franchise. No one actively enforces the players to be more expedient with their decision-making for the sake of the show, and I think that's okay. I like Rollplay for being a more raw RPG experience, it just so happens that most of the cast are professional e-entertainers or developers.  Another thing about West Marches specifically that tends to extend sessions is the RP-inspiration rule. There are usually around 2 ""asides"" that can take up a significant amount of play, on top of the usual ""reunion"" RP in-town at the start of each adventure and the associated town development and lifestyle rules. Then, during the course of play, the adventurers could get lost or slowed down with the random encounter table stuff. I'm not knocking any of these aspects of West Marches, it's one of my top two shows in Rollplay right now, but all things considered, it's not designed for pacing."

For sure though, it can be done right with careful planning and coordination between players."

We're fortunate that Jesse and Maggie aren't going to SDCC this year, so R&D is still on the table for now. Numenera was ravaged last year because of Con schedules.  It's just the nature of the business our fine role players are involved with. It's probably a blessing in a way too, it helps keep us taking breaks too and keeping our interest high."

itmejp,3d2gsn,NamelessGuise,5,Mon Jul 13 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"Lack of context on what those bullet-points represent kind of muddles them.  Alternative question: If you would prefer not to run a faction turn, why not just shorthand them through narrative? All the ""faction turn"" represents is dynamic world movement. You can achieve that by just saying ""this happened."" It has a lot less mechanical game-weight but true automation isn't necessarily a good solution.   I guess I'd have to ask why you'd rather automate this process. If it's tedious purely because you would prefer not to do it, then I'd refer to my previous statement, but if it's to have an interesting interaction that occurs in the game that surprises you as well as the PC characters, then I'd say keep going for it.  Otherwise, this is like the extreme opposite end of what happens when you over-tech everything into the faction dynamic and accidentally turn the world into Heroes of Might and Magic, except with this it feels like you're just watching five AI's play by themselves.  Just my two cents anyway."
itmejp,3d2gsn,Nyxariath,2,Mon Jul 13 00:26:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusion, just the structure/features of what I want to build.  I might make a visual representation.  The reason I like the faction turn is because it is close to being impartial.  The automation will make it so that I don't have much influence on the world, and simply edit things when the players influence the way it plays out.  The goal is to make it feel like a true sandbox experience, while not having to do the leg work.  Also, this is definitely what I want: ""to have an interesting interaction that occurs in the game that surprises you as well as the PC characters[.]""   Thanks!"
itmejp,3d2gsn,broth223,2,Mon Jul 13 00:37:04 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about this as well.  Is this something you are working on for a SWN game or a West Marchy game?   How will you implement faction goals?  Will there be a drop down to determine which direction they go in or what assets to attack?
itmejp,3d2gsn,adamthecamper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:01:28 2015 UTC,"It's going to start out pretty generic (setting agnostic) and then I might branch out from there, there will probably not be assets and units.  If I do it'll probably small medium and large forces.   They'll attack others when they pulse, besides that no real direction.  Ill try to make it so that they try and pulse to advantageous positions.  As for faction goals I havent really been thinking about it.  That might just be something I make player facing instead"

Would like to see it :-)  You might start hacking on this random github project I found that already implemented basic hex grid game of life algorithm.  https://github.com/Samnsparky/HexGranularLife  If you run it few times and squint hard enough, you could almost see some battles between armies in it, and at the end, different empires, with their borders stabilized :-) Maybe adding colors, and button to allow for single step would be a good start."

Unless you're fine with faster levelling."

itmejp,3d0br8,Hooj19,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:45:56 2015 UTC,Sorry took me a while to see this. Goals are explained in more detail about pg107 (Torchbearer).
itmejp,3d0br8,Wondercaz,2,Sun Jul 19 13:21:13 2015 UTC,"You should share your faction stuff! I'm slowing doing the same for my 5th group. Want them ready to go for when we finish the Lost Mine O'Phandelver. I'm using goals to get inspiration instead of XP and plan to include instincts once we get them figured out. My rogue is always doing the ""I would have done X"" and instincts seem to help with that."
itmejp,3d0br8,xwader,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:08:26 2015 UTC,Nah I think I want to keep it to myself. I think it's pretty awesome but I want to wait for Steven and Adam to make their own before I give mine to the world.  1. If theirs sucks I get to be the hero. 2. If theirs is better than mine then i will remain silent and use theirs in my game.
itmejp,3d0br8,happylittlelark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:44:32 2015 UTC,It's from Burning Wheel I think.
itmejp,3d0br8,happylittlelark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:38:04 2015 UTC,i think it might be from Burning Wheel
itmejp,3d19pq,brucktoo,3,Sun Jul 12 18:13:43 2015 UTC,how hot was the chicken though on a bellcurve from 3-18?
itmejp,3d19pq,Diefje,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:46:53 2015 UTC,"I fucking suck at formatting- hang on.  edit - Okay I think that's good. I don't know where this came from.  I heard about Solum a couple(?) days ago but really haven't thought about, nor have I watched one of Adams shows for a bit (catching up).  I had to flesh bits out to make the strangeness of dreams make any sense and revise it so the tabletop talk worked right.  Anyway so the very last line wasn't there- it was a little funny and a bit disconcerting to wake up with Kharne laughing madly in my mind."
itmejp,3d0wte,freshrprince,2,Sun Jul 12 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"It was when he was playing Azril. I don't remember when it happened specifically but I do know it was after week 33.  EDIT: With a bit of a looksie at the rollplay wiki, I'm almost positive it was during week 35."
itmejp,3d0wte,EdgarAllanBroe2,2,Sun Jul 12 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"It was during a short questline where they were pursuing a goblin bounty. This group of goblins had a troll, so after the party killed it, Azril reanimated it and rode on its back into the fight. I don't remember what week either, but I believe it was fairly soon after Azril joined the party.  Edit: Nope, scratch that, I thought you were talking about getting on something's back. My mistake."
itmejp,3d0wte,VyRe40,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:52:23 2015 UTC,I think it was on the lead up to the party crossing the mountains that led them to the final dragonsbane weapon. They ran into a camp of ogres while they were asleep and ambushed them.
itmejp,3d0wte,Cilosid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:34:51 2015 UTC,"I watched it recently but don't remember the exact part. It was near the end of the original RollPlay right before the Red Dragon healed Vincent's critical wounds, because he was leaping off of Vincent's back despite his injury. Maybe they were fighting the two-headed trolls at the time? Somewhere in the last two weeks of the original Rollplay, I guess."
itmejp,3cwwvu,lCore,32,Sat Jul 11 14:17:16 2015 UTC,"Eight highly-trained assassins, all linked psychically to Howard? Sounds like the typical blend of awesome and a bit silly that swansong's all about. I can dig it :D"
itmejp,3cwwvu,DickScissors,8,Sat Jul 11 14:27:10 2015 UTC,Each assassin is a Tentacle of Howard. :P How glorious.
itmejp,3cwwvu,abyssionknight,6,Sat Jul 11 17:29:26 2015 UTC,That's perfect. Howard's Tentacles sounds like Highbeam's answer to Fate's Rangers
