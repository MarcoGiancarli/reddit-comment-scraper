Walking down the street at 8:30am (because parents suck) we passed the only movie theater in town.  There, on the sidewalk in front of the box office, was Star Wars. The actual reels of film in the shipping box/container with a handwritten label on it that said ""Star Wars"". No one in sight.  I looked at my brother, he looked at my dad. We all thought about it for about a minute before my dad decided that teaching his kids to steal was a bad idea. So we got breakfast and went to the 11:00am showing.

I think it was more of a 60-something director who hadn't directed in a long time, trying to make a trilogy for 12 year olds, as he was surrounded by people with no reason to question him or his decisions. Everything Lucas had done til this point had been gold.

He took on his new life with the same tenacity and resourcefulness that he relied on over the South China Sea.  He painstakingly learned the English language. He worked as a janitor at night while going to electronics school during the day. When he got a job at Boeing, he awakened at 4 every morning and was out the door a half-hour later. A family in a Lutheran church helped sponsor his family. Still, six months after he arrived in the United States, he took his family off government assistance, telling them the United States was the land of opportunity.  He just didn't want to take; he wanted to give back. He told his family they were going to become U.S. citizens within five years so they could pay taxes and vote. From his children, he expected stellar grades and told them college was non-negotiable. He would pay their way if they earned good grades.

As a Canadian of Vietnamese decent, I grew up around Vietnamese immigrants that didn't' have the same determination and drive to become part of society.   My dad was a VNN (Republic of Vietnam Navy) Communications officer. After the war, his naval ship sailed south and I think it got to Indonesia. They were given amnesty and Canada sponsored my father.   He finished high school in Canada and went to Community college to become a mechanic. He had a successful mechanic shop and met my mother (whole other story). I was born in Canada.   He paid his taxes, he's surprisingly patriotic, and he worked his way to become a plant supervisor for a small office company. Get paid a salary and paid his taxes.   Why am I emphasizing on paying taxes and contributing to Canada.  A lot of immigrants from Vietnam try to avoid paying taxes, doing under the table deals, and work for cash. They stay within their own communities and think the government is going to steal their money. This leads to a lot of scams, organized crime, and illegal activity. Always finding easy ways to make money and getting taken for all they had.   My parents stayed clear of all that. Both parents paid taxes, we stayed away from those type of communities, even though we have friends in there, and we're often persuaded to do what everyone else is doing.   I woke up every Saturday, went to Vietnamese Language classes. We lived in a tiny apartment for 20+ years. I finished college and now I'm an IT professional.   People often ask me why I didn't go into Nails, real estate, or some other stupid task. I said I wanted to pay taxes, I wanted to stay away from the crummy stereotypes. I didn't want to be associated with the shitty community of cheats/scammers/gangs. I wanted to make an honest living.   I've seen friends die, I've seen family die, I've known a lot of people that went to jail. Living that life style. The 80s and 90s weren't great for the Vietnamese in the Toronto area. Gangs and violence everywhere.   Those that knew my family, knew we wanted to keep clean, and they protected and respected our choice.  But not a lot of people went this route.   So I applaud Mr. Nguyen for instilling such high moral values into his family and his children as did my father. To give back to the society that gave him and my father a chance to live in a country that allowed his children to have free schooling, and opportunity that they might not have had under communist Vietnam."

This is the type of shit that makes you turn into a lazy worker as evidenced by me. ""Oh, you busted your ass and did all that work faster and more efficiently than anyone else? Here's a fuckload more work than anyone else has to manage as your reward"" Why would the kids need to learn a lesson of ""take your time"" unless their homework was consistently incorrect due to speeding through it? They'd just see it as punishment/busy work."
todayilearned,3e24di,SuccumbedToReddit,-6,Tue Jul 21 16:38:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, so your laziness is someone else's fault. I see."
todayilearned,3e24di,SgtBanana,61,Tue Jul 21 16:45:58 2015 UTC,"That was an easy shot to take. When you think about it, punishing children for doing their work quickly and correctly is a bit strange; it seems like it would be counter-intuitive, especially in this fast paced day and age."
todayilearned,3e24di,SuccumbedToReddit,41,Tue Jul 21 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but the excuse one specific thing out of one's control just so happened to have turned someone in a lazy person is a pretty ... well, lazy excuse. Wait..."
todayilearned,3e24di,PaintDog,24,Tue Jul 21 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"Or, hear me out, this is a normal fucking thing that happens to many humans who are raised to receive punishment after completing their work flawlessly and quickly. Do you tell a hypersexual girl that her being raped at age 8 had nothing to do with her hypersexuality in her older years? Do you tell your kid to do the dishes, then when he finishes do you dump a new load of dishes in the sink as a thank you? Do punish your new puppy for finally shitting outside? It's negative reinforcement and it doesn't work. For anything. It's fear based. I'm not going to argue I'm not lazy, but I am going to argue giving me more work after I've beat out everyone in the company is a bullshit move and makes no one work harder. Managers only do this because they think you'll just keep taking whatever paperwork dildo's they shove up your ass because the other 8 employees don't do jack shit. Why? Because they learned they get routinely fucked over for having any type of enthusiasm or work ethic. It's a piss poor managing and parenting tactic. Any one or place that punishes you for succeeding, being efficient, being accurate, or working hard, is a bullshit person/place you should get away from."
todayilearned,3e24di,Efficiency_straw,15,Tue Jul 21 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with negative reinforcement. I'm pretty sure it would go like this:  ""Oh, you're done already? You did great! But you still have some time to kill, so you can use it to practice more math problems""  I doubt it would be seen as punishment.  Though I agree the same thing sucks in a workplace."
todayilearned,3e24di,PaintDog,17,Tue Jul 21 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"You're supposed to let kids do fun things if they finish all their homework quickly and correctly. Life isn't about work. Fuck work. You have such a limited amount of time as a kid, let the kids go out and play if they can do their math homework that well. It would seem like punishment if you were a kid. There is plenty of time to waste all your hours working, and that time comes with the remaining 3/4ths of your life you spend as an adult."
todayilearned,3e24di,Efficiency_straw,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't take the asian dad approach either, I'm just saying the intent isn't negative reinforcement. So your comparisons may be liiiittle over the top."
todayilearned,3e24di,PaintDog,30,Tue Jul 21 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree again. Intent doesn't matter. It's what happens and what you actually do that matters. Negative reinforcement may not be the intent, but that's what it is. I'm not calling the guy out for being a bad parent or anything, I'm just saying if my parents gave me more, EXTRA homework for doing my work quickly and correctly, I'd quickly despise them for punishing me when I'm doing my best."
todayilearned,3e24di,guysnake,34,Tue Jul 21 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I think the intent does matter. If he said ""you need to do more work anyway"" that could have serious negative effects but if he said ""good but I think you need more practice"" the kids, while annoyed because what kid likes work, wouldn't feel damaged."
todayilearned,3e24di,PaintDog,-7,Tue Jul 21 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"Well do we know how he phrased it though? Also, I'd argue what you said is the definition of intent. He wanted more and better from his kids, and he could articulate that to them after their math homework. However, the article is pretty vague and I can't tell if he was a dickhead hardass that never let his kids have fun, or if he just wanted the best for them. It's a delicate line, you know."

todayilearned,3e24di,Dinimuetter,8,Tue Jul 21 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"I was raised up that way too and I think it's about the methodology of how my dad got me to do the work. It wasn't a punishment, it was a way of getting ahead of everyone else instead of wasting time on TV (we never got a TV because we all saw it as a time sink). As a result I was well ahead of everyone else in pretty much all academic aspect at the expense of not knowing what Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon was. I'm in college and I'm still thanking him for teaching me from  an early age to strive forward. In the end, it's about beating your own self and becoming a better man, not about what the bloke next to you."
todayilearned,3e24di,PaintDog,7,Tue Jul 21 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"I understand this point entirely. My point is that this kind of thing doesn't matter. How much better is your life compared to the bloke next to you that dicked around and had fun his entire life? Is he some poor peasant with no discretionary income and no joy in his life? Or is he pretty much comparable to you and 95% of the people in this world? I think most of us can end up just fine and it takes an extreme on either end (super strict or never there) that will turn anyone into something different than a normal person. Are you a CEO or something? Are you making vastly more than the median wage of the country you're in? Are you above and beyond most other people? If not, what's the point of denying your childhood joys? Your standards of humanity. It just seems like a waste to me."

todayilearned,3e24di,DoubleDeadGuy,44,Tue Jul 21 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"The Chinook has water landing capability in a limited fashion, but from my understanding it still needs to have it's rotors moving. Later on they created kits to increase it's abilities, however it still does not ""land"" or float without it's rotors creating downdraft.   Last thing you want to be is under the rotors when it flops down to the wrong side. With what he did he was able to predict which sides his rotors would be hitting to give him a path of escape. He had limited fuel, not a lot of time for a ""better plan.""  It worked, he lived, his family lived, and no one on board was injured, and the chinook sunk like it would have no matter what."
todayilearned,3e24di,Bennyboy1337,39,Tue Jul 21 18:18:59 2015 UTC,The rotors would have created a whirlpool that would have sucked him under. By rolling it he was able to put a giant hunk of metal between himself and the whirlpool.  Source: The documentary Last Days in Vietnam

If he jumped out at height he could have knocked himself out or broken a limb. Additionally, the unmanned helicopter could then crash into the ship."
todayilearned,3e24di,berenstein49,7,Tue Jul 21 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"This is the answer. That is a lot of mass moving at a tremendous speed. Also, the sea isnt typically sitting flat and still. He couldnt predict where his rotors would make impact unless he did what he did."
todayilearned,3e24di,murderhuman,8,Tue Jul 21 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"the Chinook was too big to land on the ship and he was almost out of fuel.  he managed to hover above the ship while his family was successfully taken aboard then ditched it in the ocean to avoid crashing into the ship and attempt to save his own life.  One of the really amazing things about the whole ordeal was that he took off his flight suit while hovering just a few feet above the water - only a truly skilled pilot could do this, and even then it would almost be impossible.  if you are interested in this story and want more, you should really check out Last Days in Vietnam - it is a wonderful documentary - it made me cry...a lot, but totally worth it."

The fact of the matter is, outside of aircraft carriers and helicopters, the US is much more evenly matched with its likely opponents (see the amount of submarines and combat aircraft each nation has for proof) than most Americans would care to admit. As for their supposed 'economic might', America isn't even the world's no. 1 economy in terms of PPP GDP or the world's largest manufacturer (China and the EU take the top and second spots respectively)."

However it's also clear that everything he does is extremely calculated and you can't really deny the success."
todayilearned,3e0xwu,dekenfrost,64,Tue Jul 21 09:57:03 2015 UTC,I think it's more a responsibility to the people who listen to it to realise he's just being silly.
todayilearned,3e0xwu,AutoChrist,13,Tue Jul 21 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"Correct. It is like saying The Onion has a responsibility to report real news because a lot of people don't know about it. I remember when bonsaikitten.com went up (so many years ago now), PETA and news organizations flipped their shit thinking it wasn't satire.  Adults need to lighten the fuck up and not take everything they read and hear as gospel and parents need to teach their children this."

todayilearned,3e0xwu,blocparty,14,Tue Jul 21 10:29:07 2015 UTC,His age is irrelevant. It's about the time he Became famous and who was most likely listening to his music at the time.

Cooper wanted Eminem to talk about the juxtaposition of having a poor grade/high school performance/experience yet still having a rich scholarly mindset.    Eminem dropped out of school, no high school diploma or GED. But he has a stronger diction than most university English professors. Cooper does a great job of broaching this; by using simple terms, he makes the subject more open-ended giving Eminem a wider spectrum to talk about the juxtaposition. So now Eminem not only responds to the core idea Cooper sought, but he can do so through his own lens rather than a more leading one had Cooper been less simplistic in his questioning."

I mean, do you think the Earth is like 6,000 years old too? Modern geology also contradicts the Bible then.  It's important to remember that the Bible was written by people 2000 years ago, translated and retranslated, and people are flawed. Maybe there is a God, maybe not, but it's not like God is being contradicted, it's people's interpretation of what God may or may not have dictated."

The aforementioned actors who stepped in to fill in for him not only took on different aspects of his persona, it was more about becoming a man that the people who drew into his Imaginarium would be the least likely to resist... He was essentially trying to prove that there were inherently ""pure"" humans who couldn't be corrupted by temptation and carnal pleasures. He did this by woo-ing the womens and taking them on a magical ride through the surreal landscape. Eventually there came a fork in the road, one of which lead to a sleazy motel, and the other a grassy knoll or a swingset or something equally pure and serene. The 3 other actors who stepped in for Heath assume the body of whatever the victim would find the most difficult to resist a sexual liaison with, thus reaffirming the experiment. If they chose the G-Rated ending, they get to walk away having experienced a lucid dream. If they chose the X-Rated ending, their soul is consumed. Unfortunately for Dr. Pernassus (to my knowledge/memory) he is unable to win his bet with the Devil and loses everything, including his daughter. Personally I thought the movie was very imaginative and interesting and I love Lily Cole (who plays the daughter, and is fantastic) but as someone who engages in casual sex, I found the overarching premise of the movie that sexuality is sinful to be kind of off-putting."

Cost of each car = $28,500 (literally just google this its right there)    Total cost of cars = about $7.9 million  Percent of Oprah's net worth spent on this venture: 0.26%  BE PATIENT WE WILL GET TO THE POINT WHERE ALL THIS MAKES SENSE  Money She Has Given to Her Charity for a School in Africa  According to a google search that is from an unreliable website (but again idgaf) Oprah has given about $40 million to her charity  Percent of her net worth spent on this venture: 1.33%  WHY ARE THESE PERCENTAGES IMPORTANT??  Good question, let's imagine certain different types of people giving a proportionate amount. AGAIN DISCLAIMER I KNOW THESE NUMBERS MAY BE OFF AND SHE HAS PROBABLY GIVEN WAY MORE AT OTHER TIMES JUST STICK WITH ME  What if a rich doctor gave like Oprah??  Okay so google tells me that the doctors with the lowest net worth are family physicians having an average $1.95 million net worth.  If doc gave an amount proportionate to Oprah's car give away:  $1.95 million x 0.26% = about $5k  If doc gave an amount proportionate to school in africa:  $40 mil x 1.33% = about $26,000  Oprah buying almost three hundred people cars is like a rich doctor taking himself and his wife to Africa for a medical missions trip, while Oprah donating $40 MILLION is like a doctor buying his wife a brand new mini van (SIDENOTE EVERYONE GO DONATE TO WATER.ORG)  Okay that is a lot of money but I'm not a doctor make this more relevant to me please  Alright I'm boring you with math and words sorry I'll speed this up (don't even start on the wage gap and one percenters just be happy)   Average American Household net worth (according to Wall Street Journal in 2010 Apparently) : $182,000  In order to give a comparable amount to Oprah's car giving, the average american family would have to give 473 dollars (about the price of replacing the windshield on a decent car). Similarly, if the average american gave a comparable amount to Oprah's school in africa, they would have to give $2400 (same price I bought my used car for and I am part of the most average family around).  ALRIGHT WRAP THIS UP  So, Oprah has been heralded as one of the greatest philanthropists (I guess i dont know it's just wikipedia dont kill me). BUT when putting her donations into perspective, it is honestly not much of a scratch into her wealth. Take note that the example of the average american family is someone hopefully living within their means whilst Oprah has mutliple houses worth tens of millions of dollars and jets, so her giving away money is much different than you and I giving away money because she actually has money to spend (and boy does she spend it)  THAT BEING SAID  It is incredible that Oprah has given so much, huge shoutout to her for being so giving. And who cares if she's treating herself, enjoy your houses and jets babe. It just goes to show that Oprah is not an average person. Rather than trivialize how much money Oprah has given away, I would like to instead pose a question: Why is someone who talks on a television worth as much as 16,500 american households combined? All of whom could be teachers, mechanics, salesmen, IT guys, and so on..  TL;DR If the average american family gave away as big of a percentage of money as Oprah did when spending $40 million on a school in Africa, they would only have to give enough to by a crappy used car for their kid ($2500). Why do things gotta be like they do?  edit: Okay so I just realized it's 12:40 AM and it's also just now my birthday. It took me a good forty minutes to write this and I just turned twenty.

They also have the Honorary Academy Award which they've turned into a lifetime achievement award but was originally intended to cover great achievements in film that don't fall under any existing category.

todayilearned,3dzbl3,FilmCurb,4,Tue Jul 21 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we know... It's not the Korean version but for a relatively mainstream American release, it's not bad. Compare it to the original and be disappointed. The American version doesn't compare but it holds up, if that makes sense."
todayilearned,3dzbl3,andrewegan1986,3,Tue Jul 21 04:51:19 2015 UTC,That makes perfect sense. Fan boys are just upset but I know plenty Of people who watched the U.S. Version only and they liked it. It's not a great movie but it's an enjoyable one
todayilearned,3dzbl3,daimposter,3,Tue Jul 21 05:23:47 2015 UTC,"I've only seen the American version and didn't know the premise going in. That movie rocked.

todayilearned,3dzbl3,YungSnuggie,5,Tue Jul 21 01:49:56 2015 UTC,Hahaha! My point exactly.
todayilearned,3dzbl3,aagejaeger,17,Tue Jul 21 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by cinematography here? It's such an all encompassing word that I often don't know what folks mean when they use it to critique a film. What about that scene looked behind it's time to you? Lighting? Framing? Camera work? Color? All of it perhaps?  And also the editing? I'll admit it seemed a bit sloppy when it cut to the father reentering the room but I wouldn't consider the scene terrible by any stretch. In fact the way the camera moves and follows for most of the scene, I think, gave a pretty good sense of the mother. How all of this was hurried and chaotic made me feel (similar to the mother) somewhat powerless. Especially with these two large personalities and her cries doing nothing. I liked how when we left the main perspective for a POV from the father the camera was more or less stationary and the final shot pulling away has a sobbing woman holding her dying/dead son but the focus is still on him. Not terribly complex but effective storytelling. Huh, this is longer than I expected. So what didn't you like exactly?"
todayilearned,3dzbl3,UppercutOfJustice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:00 2015 UTC,that's gunshot shot (heh) was pretty fucking terrible. you see his top half. cut to the gun for about a second shooting. It just seems worse than low budget.
todayilearned,3dzbl3,-BabbaBooey-,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"Sure. It's the camera work, lightning, color - all of it, except for some of the framing. I really don't like the parts where the cameraman moves in for dramatic effect, it makes it look like a soap opera. When it comes to the editing, I especially mean the cut to the gunshot itself and the next cut to the father. It looks amateurish to me. I know what Spike Lee is trying to invoke, which you also mention, it's just done poorly.   The father is badly directed, through and through."
todayilearned,3dzbl3,aagejaeger,8,Mon Jul 20 23:55:59 2015 UTC,"The father is badly directed, through and through.   Are you talking about his acting? I thought it was OK. I wasn't stunned by it or anything, but you can clearly see the moment where he decides he's going to kill his son. His reaction afterward seemed really appropriate. It was like he went into shock. It may be that you've just never seen a cold, murderous anger like that... so it seems stiff to you, or something?"

todayilearned,3dzbl3,eyeherpe,7,Tue Jul 21 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"Look at a movie like Reservoir Dogs that came out a year after that, and just think about how far better it looks and works. Not to mention Pulp Fiction three years later. This was even Spike Lee's ninth production."
todayilearned,3dzbl3,aagejaeger,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:53 2015 UTC,You're comparing it to some of the best and most popular movies from that time period then. I think it's more accurate to say that Tarantino was ahead of his time rather than Spike Lee was outdated.
todayilearned,3dzbl3,eyeherpe,5,Tue Jul 21 00:23:56 2015 UTC,I'm talking about the aesthetic quality of movies 25 years ago.

todayilearned,3dzbl3,aagejaeger,3,Tue Jul 21 00:30:22 2015 UTC,From that list Silence of the Lambs and T2 are the only movies with significantly better cinematography than this imo. I agree it looks cheesy but so many other major release movies from the late 80s-early 90s have a similar appearance.
todayilearned,3dzbl3,eyeherpe,3,Tue Jul 21 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"There's also Barton Fink, Thelma & Louise, Delicatessen and The Fisher King, imo.  A movie like Boyz n the Hood is leaps and bounds better than this as well, if we take a cultural angle on it."
todayilearned,3dzbl3,aagejaeger,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:17 2015 UTC,"So, ""it's dated compared to movies that came out after it,"" is what you're saying?   Or were you trying to say, ""it looks different compared to different movies by different directors"" ?"

I thought Malcolm X was an incredible movie when it came out and for me it still holds up.  Denzel was incredible in that movie and in my opinion that was his best performance to date.

The WWII bombs were only about 15 kt, which, while huge in a conventional sense, doesn't actually get you as far as most people think.  Similar sized bomb would leave the majority of Manhattan intact.  For comparison, The Tsar Bomba was more than 3000 times as powerful at 50 mt.  It had significant effects hundreds of miles away, but in the vastness of the Pacific theater, it's doubtful that any tribals who were unaware of the war would have perceived the immediate blasts of the nukes we used on Japan.  There was even one Japanese man who survived both blasts and went on the become a prominent anti nuclear advocate."

Loads of people simply aren't educated on those huge events. Dude in his 20s that I met in Jamaica left school at 12 to start working to support his mom, and then he had his own kid at 16 so never went back to school, just continued working. His knowledge of the world outside Jamaica was extremely limited when compared to modern expectations of understanding. He hadn't been educated about the world wars, nuclear bombs, didn't know what the Soviet Union was because he was too young, etc. Loads of people are only aware of current events at best because they were never educated about world history, even in some cases the largest historical events that seem like common knowledge where we live."

See a storm on the horizon? Pull up on the coast and wait for it to blow over. Modern kayaks are difficult to sink as they have air tank in the front and back to prevent this, older types don't have this little innovation but both are more prone to capsizing (easy to roll if you aren't careful) than anything and aren't proper ocean going vessels in any case. Voyage boils down to mostly keeping in sight of the coastline in case of emergency (bad weather) and prior planning for the longer jumps."

He'd have to take a slightly different  route if doing it right now, obviously, he couldn't go overland through Syria and Iraq right now but other than that I wouldn't suspect there would be a major issue if say he kayaked through the Black Sea and then went over Iran by land instead.  I've cycled a bike most of that distance myself including through countries like Syria, Iran and Myanmar. I've been through a few places experiencing ongoing insurgencies or low level civil wars but have honestly never had a problem beyond being robbed (and that never violently).  Closest I came was passing the scene of a bombing about ten minutes after it has happened. Obviously I wouldn't go to places where the people fighting actively target foreigners for kidnapping, or anywhere in the grips of an actual large scale war (like Syria or Iraq right now) but your realistic risk even in many low level war zones/insurgencies is that you are more likely to be killed by traffic.

Yet a few weeks later two Germans, May and Fischer, hearing of my trip, decided to follow my course. They were well-equipped, far better than I. But, on the way down they made the mistake of refusing Arab hospitality — they just didn’t like fleas and lice. They were both shot dead in their tents on the river bank, and everything they had was stolen.   He himself was assaulted, bound, hit and kicked by inhabitants of Lakor Island in the Moluccas.   With a boatload of officials, he promptly set off for Lakor to deal with the gangsters. He arrested six, including the leader. At the subsequent trial the leader was awarded six years’ hard labour, as were two others of his gang. Two got two years, and one got a year.

todayilearned,3e1dqj,PlanetoftheAtheists,30,Tue Jul 21 05:18:07 2015 UTC,It wasn't 'a thing.' Kirk Kerkorian who owned MGM Studios at the time sold MGM to Ted Turner. Turner who primarily owned television assets kept the studio film vaults and all the films and sold everything else. It was around this time that Turner began to reformat and colorise films for redistribution on his television networks.   Some of the colorizations were so bad they actually brought out stars and directors to start fighting against colorization and for film preservation. Turner also cashed in on this by forming channels such as TCM to show classic Hollywood films as they were intended at their release.

If George wants to ruin his shit, light it on fire and remove every copy of his work from the public - it should be his right to do so.   If George decided to remaster LoTR without the consent of Peter Jackson, then there would be a slight ethical issue.  From what I read from AngryHandJob was that because it's been released to the public, it should be up to the fans because they're the ones who cherished it etc. Fans don't and should never have creative control over a production.

Secondly, the value demonstrated is not that you can twitch someones finger, it's that you can induce signals in neurons that can result in behavioral outputs.  In theory, ANYTHING that your brain can do can be 'hijacked' in this way, we just have to improve the technology to do it.  The fact that it can be mapped to an EEG reading of someone else's brain is important because, in theory, we could induce complex constellations of activity without an outlandish layer of conceptual interfacing.  (instead of clicking a button that says 'think of a dog', it could be induced by merely thinking of a dog.)  Also, it's REALLY important that the input was to the cortex, and not directly to the alpha motor neurons.  The cortex is where action and consequences are conceived, not where muscle twitches are generated.  This wasn't a simple 'pushing of his finger'........it was a 'tricking his brain into thinking that pushing his finger was a good idea'."

todayilearned,3dz2fv,seanjohn12117,69,Mon Jul 20 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"Bruce Lee was loosely choreographed. There was general understanding of his moves and the outcome, but the directors always really trusted Lee. His speed is authentic, as is his power, and his ability to come millimeters from a full power hit to a mere tap.   Also, Bruce Lee was largely his own choreographers."
todayilearned,3dz2fv,TeddysBigStick,6,Mon Jul 20 22:48:15 2015 UTC,Think he would be able to wrestle Lincoln?
todayilearned,3dz2fv,Kaberu,12,Tue Jul 21 04:57:33 2015 UTC,Yes actually. He trained with Gene LeBell. Gene is a 10th degree red belt in judo and 9th degree black belt in Japanese JuJitsu and has a lot of wrestling experience. What does all this mean to the common person? He is a world class badass. His most famous/active student today is Ronda Rousey. She calls him uncle gene.
todayilearned,3dz2fv,Phoenix_2015,2,Tue Jul 21 10:08:26 2015 UTC,"Dude, Lincoln had a foot and fifty pounds on Lee, and was a champion in the sport. Lee was great and all, but the idea he would is absurd. LeBell is also on the record saying their training was not particularly serious. Bruce also said that LeBell kicked his as when ever they seriously spared"
todayilearned,3dz2fv,Destroytheimage,81,Tue Jul 21 16:35:19 2015 UTC,Being a champion 200 years ago doesn't mean much when comparing with people today

todayilearned,3dz2fv,DropHawk,15,Tue Jul 21 01:20:28 2015 UTC,I learned from an interview with a former student of Bruce Lee that Bruce was not a fighter. That was just a popular misconception. He was a teacher.  Edit: It was an interview with Joe Lewis. Source   Bruce was not a fighter. He was an actor and a teacher. He was a great teacher.
todayilearned,3dz2fv,ugotamesij,27,Mon Jul 20 23:59:12 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that he means teacher as a superior title to fighter, as he spent so much time training with him..   Joe Lewis - I learn fast. I made black belt in one year in Okinawa in three different styles. I am a fast learning. I can get all your stuff in a matter of weeks, and I mean anybody who can fight. I worked with Bruce less than two years before we grew apart. We used to work together for 6 to 8 hours at a time. I would be at his house at one in the afternoon, and not leave until maybe ten that night. Is that one lesson? Bruce was not a fighter. He was an actor and a teacher. He was a great teacher.  Bruce told me he did not care about competing. He had no interest in it, and he said he felt there was nothing to gain by him doing so. Little guys, in my opinion, have always been the best trainers. This is because tactically very early in their careers they figure out how to conquer larger opponents. Mike Stone, who I respect, convinced me to study with Bruce. Martial arts does not have a long history as does boxing. Bruce Lee was a wealth of knowledge. No one knew what he had. Bruce Lee was proud to be the instructor of three world champions, Norris, Stone, and myself. With private lessons, he could customize each lesson to fit and compliment the attributes of the individual. I teach this way also."
todayilearned,3dz2fv,johnturkey,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:08 2015 UTC,He got in a lot of street fights in Hong Kong. Also rooftop fights among martial arts students.  That's what made him despise classical martial arts. He called them swimming on dry land.

These men have both trained for many years since and seen many fighters. They still insist that Bruce was better than anyone else they've seen before or since.  I'll take their word over the random guy on the internet who wears Tapout shirts un-ironically.
todayilearned,3dz2fv,Tiltboy,3,Tue Jul 21 04:59:32 2015 UTC,"Take their word on what?  What exactly are they claiming about Bruce Lee?  Are they just saying Bruce Lee was a really really good fighter and a rare individual?  I don't think many would argue with that.  Or are these guys saying Bruce Lee was THE best on earth as far as hand to hand fighting goes for that era?  Like say the 1960s.  Or a specific year?    Lets say someone is making the argument that Bruce Lee was the best fighter on earth in 1964 (just estimating, before he hurt his back I think).  The other side of the argument would be all the other candidates for such a title from that year.  Who was the Muy Thai kickboxing champion in Thailand in 1964?  Lumpinee stadium was already built, surely the champion there has a case to be considered for such a title as ""best fighter in 1964"".   1964 was an olympic year.  What about the gold medalists for judo and wrestling?  They won at the highest levels against international competition that year, maybe some of them would rank ahead of Bruce Lee in the discussion of best martial artist in 1964?    My point is that any specific claim about Bruce Lee being the best fighter for whatever year will have some very strong arguments against it.  There were simply too many other people during Bruce Lee's period proving themselves as being more worthy of such a title."

It is based on Church attendance rather than whether the individual identifies with what we would consider religious. In a largely rural, agrarian society, Church attendance would be quite cumbersome.  “Upon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect of the country was the first thing that struck my attention.” - Alexis de Tocqueville.  Undoubtedly the United States was not founded as a Christian government. Separation of church and state and the intent of the founders to create a secular government is undeniable.  It is something else entirely to claim that the population of the United States was not religious or Christian. This claim is contradicted by historian after historian."

todayilearned,3e2k60,Drooperdoo,9,Tue Jul 21 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"Like it or not, the church is a basic unit within any given society. Look at the Middle East. When the secular government collapsed, the mosques were still used as a networking system. Same thing in the Roman Empire. After the secular government fell apart, it was the church that maintained infrastructure and social cohesion. As late as the US civil rights movement, it was run out of church circuit in the South [which explained why a minister--Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.--was in charge.]  Historically, whenever secular governments implode, the church is the organization left behind that usually maintains civil order.  This did not change in early colonial America. Every village had a small church. Why? In an age before the internet, that's how people networked. They didn't have TV or message boards. To know what was going on, people went down to the central hub: the church.  The reason why church attendance is now dying in the West is because technology [and government] has largely taken on the role and mandate of the church.  For someone to claim that ""people were less religious"" back in the 1700s is a hoot. The church enjoyed a dominance back then not seen since. Why? Who else provided that central hub? Who else gave charity to the poor?   Hell, look at the stranglehold of the church in even bad things like the Salem Witch Trials. Or the Puritans who made it to America and founded the nation on a level of intolerance not permitted back in England. Entire states were defined by their affiliation with a given sect [like Philadelphia being called ""The Quaker State"" or Delaware being the Catholic state, etc.]  And check out Maryland's mandated cross on its pole flying the state flag: http://www.sos.state.md.us/Services/flags/d012746a.gif  When I took my kids to Washington, DC, they pointed this out on the tour: The 49 other states merely have knobs on the poles holding their flags--except for Maryland, which legally has to have a cross.   Footnote: In summation, people in the 1700s relied on the church to a far greater degree than people today because the church performed most of the services that we associate with the State today. It was also the only central hub and meeting place for you to see your neighbors. For you to know what was happening in your community. For businessmen to network and make commercial contacts. Ben Franklin belonged to something like 7 different churches, all to network. It was the Linkedin of its day. Even Thomas Jefferson (who anti-religious people like to hold up as their example) attended his local Anglican church and made hefty contributions to it. So people who are like, ""But he was a deist! He was a deist!"" neglect to notice that, despite being a deist, he was right there in church with everyone else."
