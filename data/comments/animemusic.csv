This song in question is also a remix of theme for the last boss in the ninth Touhou game, Phantasmagoria of Flower View.

Also, don't feel like you need to play everything exactly the same especially if you are just starting. Simplify stuff and have fun!!  I will link the songs when I am not on mobile. I haven't seen as many series as others here but I'll do my best.   Resonance - T.M. Revolution  Hacking to the Gate - Kanaka Itou  When you get a bit more experienced, Darker Than Black has some great songs to play along with even if it doesn't exactly match perfectly. Some really cool songs. Kano Yoko is fantastic. Here are just a few.   High Heel Runaway   Tenderly  Guy (this one is simple compared to the others)"

animemusic,3cvvuq,Freeza,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:01:44 2015 UTC,"There's nothing I love doing more than helping out beginner drummers or anyone that wants to learn.  You mentioned JRock and Vocaloid earlier so my immediate thought was Supercell's early pieces.   I recommend Line and Hinekure Mono which have a simple beat with a decent amount of variation to keep it interesting.   They are also quiter songs, which will help with your dynamics. Biggest thing for beginners is learning how loud to play. Most play too loud and it drowns out the other instruments.   From then on it is whatever you like. I have loads of fun playing everything else on Supercell's first album as well as Girls Dead Monster from Angel Beats.   Have fun playing."

Crystal Energy, Mai Otome's second opening; Full version here and Lyrics here. At this point in the show, I was like ""hell freaking YES!"".  Unyielding Wish from Magic Knight Rayearth; Full version here with Lyrics here and a freaking English version (albeit it's a lot softer but still great). Talk about the height of the 90's with this one! You're sure to raise some heads. Ayakashi Night from Kekkaishi; Full version here and Lyrics here. This was MY show to watch on Adult Swim way back when! This also applies to the next show which is... ...Reckless Fire from Scryed; Full version here and Lyrics here. Yeah... you can kinda tell how badly I wanted to stay up late when I was 10-13 years old when ""Adult"" Swim was going on.   Sad/Emotional openings:   Tori no Uta (The Song of a Bird) from Air. This theme alone made me want to watch the show even more! I'm so glad to have reached the goal if you know what I mean. Full version here and Lyrics here Last Regrets from Kanon (2006); Full version here and Lyrics here. Damn, this song is as sad as much as it is beautiful. This is the only show that I have seen to completion in a single day, and this opening is a major reason why.   Exciting openings:   Sugar Baby Love from A Little Snow Fairy Sugar; Full version here and Lyrics here. Those of you who grew up listening to 70's music should recognize this. If not, well here you go! As for the show itself, yes it is very cute and silly (emphasis on cute); but it can get downright sad and serious at times too. It's a pretty unique experience if you're tired of the typical Moe show you've come to expect these days. Suddenly from Battle Programmer Shirase; Full version here and I cannot find the lyrics (sorry about that). Yes, even Anime has its own rick-roll; so, go troll your other anime friends with this! This show is not only terribly obscure, but it never really got a proper completion. It's still a very interesting premise, and you'll more than likely enjoy following it nonetheless.

Yasashisa no Ryuu, 3.HIshoku no Sora D: 1. Itsuka no, Ikutsuka no Kimi to no Sekai   E: 1.COLORFUL BOX,   F: 1.Kimi ga Yume o Tsuretekita H: 1.Staple Stable,  G: 1. Kimiiro Signal   Thoughts on the actual selections:   My Soul, Your Beats!; probably one of the longtime favorites of many, well arranged, sometimes jarring  melodically, some what boring, carried by popularity.  Ambiguous: Nothing really bad about it, but suffers from nana muzuki anime syndrome where there is just too many noisy sounds with no purpose in the background,  Tank: should be disqualified for being a jazz piece with 5 words Platinum Disco; enjoy for the visuals only, iguchi can occasionally sing , but this is not one of these occasions, Guren no Yumiya: Works well with building hype with the visuals, terribly noisy and harsh otherwise, generally unlistenable; carried by initial hype and visuals. Flyers: HUGE RECENCY BIAS, i'm sure this is an acquired taste for some, otherwise probably would never get this far in a few years.  This game: Pretty much well received everywhere since it came out, amazing catchy to begin but questionable afterwards. Konomi suzuki is pretty polarizing for personally, i'm not sure a fripside/kotoko -esk song suites her singing. A solid meh, given the random talking 2:15 in. Unravel: Never realized tokyo ghoul got this popular. I am biased against male vocalists most of the time, a raspy voice doesn't make better.   I haven't frequented r/anime since the moderation catastrophe began a lil over a year ago, but i'd assume this just boiled down to a glorified popularity contest."
animemusic,3a2cpu,gloverc7,3,Tue Jun 16 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, pretty much. Any old titles are voted on with nostalgia goggles, especially for older series, and speaking of that:  I agree with your words on Tank. I honestly think it's overrated. I mentioned that on the thread and got downvoted, despite the fact I justified my reasoning more than ""omg Tank should win!""  I think This Game doesn't deserve best opening, but it's certainly a lot better than Tank imo, and as a piano player the solo during the bridge + intro are extremely welcome, considering the plethora of guitar solos in other songs. It stands out and it's quite pretty visually wise, it's catchy, and the melody is a ton of fun to play on Osu!  I don't watch much anime, so my personal list is pretty limited. I generally like your choices for opening songs. If I had to change one thing, I'd probably add a Guilty Crown opening or maybe the recent Brave Shine - really liked those a lot as a viewer and listener, even though those anime have flaws."

I get why it's so liked, but it just doesn't work for me even though I do like the singer and the style of music.  In Bracket D I'm surprised Period got to the semis, I didn't know it was that popular. I would've had it out first round or at least lose to only my railgun.  And if I were to pick 1 song that I think should be in the bracket, it's Kawaru Mirai by ChouCho, the OP to Heaven's Memo Pad"

animemusic,3a1d7l,chikedor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:42:49 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong but what the hell is this? The tempo just got lowered and there's nothing hip hop about it.
animemusic,3a1d7l,YachiyoTodoroki,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"It's just a beat, where you can rap. I've changed the tempo and the pitch, changed some percussion and added some samples. Yep, it's not very different from the original, I didn't chopped it because I really liked the whole song, that's why I called an 'edit'.  Here you can listen to it with a random rap acapella.  https://clyp.it/j2d1jlkn"

animemusic,39oqdy,Squirrelk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:14:54 2015 UTC,Plenty of bands have profound lyrics. You're just not looking hard enough.
animemusic,39oqdy,Dalathan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong but my point stands, the sheer quantity of literary garbage that is spewed by popular music sources is astounding. I do not doubt the existence of high quality songwriting, I merely despise how seemingly scarce it is in respect to the average persons listening habits."
