comicbooks,3e2xe4,SoylentGreenMuffins,10,Tue Jul 21 19:05:15 2015 UTC,"This was an incredible climax to Bill Mantlo's career on the Hulk.   Mantlo came on in 1980 and broke a pattern of formulaic Hulk stories by sending the Hulk around the world, into outer space (where we first met Rocket Raccoon), gave us an extended period of the Hulk with Banner's brain, only to slowly lose it all and become a totally savage monster, whereupon he was exiled to the Crossroads.  While Peter David is usually thought of as the first guy to breathe some life into the Hulk, Bill Mantlo was truly the first guy to experiment with his status quo. Greg Pak cites Mantlo as a primary inspiration and set up this page on this site for his ongoing care."

comicbooks,3e0xlm,KokiriResident,3,Tue Jul 21 13:49:37 2015 UTC,"hide it by sheer force of will   You can never hide it, at most you can distract from it. Stuttering feels like a physical problem, like when you throw out your back and the pain just pops in at random times. It's the same, where you'll be speaking and randomly your jaw, neck, tongue just lock up and you cant get a word out. You know what you want to say, but you can feel yourself stuck. No amount of willpower can get your body to stop.  Like /u/Hughtoc said, speech therapy can do wonders, but that takes years and even then it's doesn't get rid of it 100%. I've noticed that I'm more self-aware when I'm speaking and it helps me pace and pick my words, but even then if I get too excited I start to slip back.   It used to be really bad, but I've gotten to a place where I can speak relatively clear enough to even host a few podcasts now. But despite my stutter being mostly under control, it's still really easy to slip back into it when i'm nervous/excited/anxious."

comicbooks,3e1j3l,Frankfusion,4,Tue Jul 21 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"Well, lets start with the good:    Oliver Copiel's art is awesome. He has some wonderful pages. I was really sad to see that he didn't finish out the whole event. Having said that, Giuseppe Camuncoli penciled the last couple issues and really brought his A game. While he's not the worst, Camuncoli is pretty hit or miss for me, but he did some great things in the Spider-Verse issues. Its a lot of fun seeing the various Spider-Men from the multiverse. Its not really every iteration of Spider-Man, like Marvel was advertising. But its a blast getting to see characters that I'd never expect to see anywhere ever again (like from the What If stories where Betty and Flash get bitten by the radioactive spider and take Peter's place). The fight with Peter and SpOck at about the half way point. I'll say no more.   Now for the not so good:   Pretty much everything else. The pacing is horrid. Nothing really happens in the whole ""event"". Most of the time is spent with Spider-Man either being murdered or standing around talking about how they're going to get murdered if they don't do something quick. The story consists of Morlun (and his family) flipping on God Mode and just endlessly killing Spider-Men in a single panel. Or, more often, off panel. Until, randomly, for no real reason other than the plot needed, they got nerfed and and the Spider-Men could fight them. Virtually no communication with the writers doing the tie in issues. Its like Slott didn't even bother to talk to or read what the other writers were doing, at all. There were so many blatant plot contradictions that it became tiresome. The characters are written horribly. Seriously. Its insulting for any long time Spider-Man reader. 616-Peter has defeated Morlun twice and he just randomly forgot how he did it (despite nearly losing both his own life and MJs to him)? Common. Silk. She is insufferable in this story. Just horrid. Everything about her. The scene linked above is insulting to Peter Parker in every conceivable way. This impacts continuity in virtually no way. We pretty much return to status quo at its ending and the story is completely forgotten."

Slott makes a total mess of the execution fairly often, but you can't fault his exuberance.  Sticking the character in a time capsule and never having anything interesting or different happen to him is boring. Setting any hero up as the ultimate do-no-wrong good guy against villains with no redeeming qualities is boring.  The entire Superior saga is interesting because it rehabilitates Doc Ock into a guy who is occasionally right about things, and is actually good at doing what he does. When the hero defeats a competent, complex villain, it's a lot more interesting. Isn't it?"

comicbooks,3e1j3l,TryTheRedOne,7,Tue Jul 21 10:01:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I started reading comics again just as Superior was ramping up, and I found the character fascinating for the way he handled being Spider-Man. Not because he actually WAS superior, but for the way the character took advantage of Parker's resources, showing how Parker could do things if he was a bit more morally flexible. Superior always struck me as an anti-hero trying to live to an ideal he could never quite meet.   I think that was Slott's aim: looking at Spidey through a different lens, an extended what-if. Same with Spider-Verse, really. Though I do wish he'd just hand the book off to someone else at this point...he doesn't seem to have anything interesting to say anymore."

Who is this guy and what makes him tick?”   Cyborg Isn’t Like Any Other Superhero   “One of the things that drives the decisions I make is that Vic is one of the few characters in the DC universe who doesn’t have an alter ego,” Walker explains. “Superman has Clark Kent, Batman has Bruce Wayne, Green Lantern can be Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, or someone else—they have these secret identities and personas that Vic simply doesn’t have.” It’s not just that Vic spends all his time as Cyborg, Walker says, but that he literally doesn’t have a choice. “If you want to get technical about it, Cyborg isn’t his persona, Cyborg is his disability—the machinery and technology that keeps him alive after this terrible accident has happened to this kid.”   Cyborg Is the Existential Technological Sci-Fi Comic Book You’ve Been Waiting For:   “Physically, he’s more machine than he is man,” Walker says about the state that Stone is in at the start of the series (although, as a preview of the new series reveals, his machine side is in flux). “What does that mean? When you look at him, he looks like he’s a robot, but he’s not a robot. At the end of the day—and this is me getting all philosophical—but if all human beings have a soul, then Victor Stone definitely has a soul. The fact that he’s 70 percent machine doesn’t change that. That’s the most universal truth with that character: How does he find the balance between the reality of being mostly a machine, but he’s a human being, with everything that comes with that?”  Expect his friends and family to help with that… and hinder it, as well, Walker teases. “You’ll see characters pull him towards humanity, like Sarah Charles, who sees him as a person. But then we have a character like his father, and it’s never quite clear how he feels about Vic: Does he love his son, or is he more interested in the technology? The effect of that can be to dehumanize his son.”   It's All About Us:   “There’s the connection that modern technology has created, but there’s also this disconnect,” Walker says. “I see it all the time now. I go out for dinner with my friends, and everybody’s on their iPhones. It’s amazing how you can be in a room with somebody and not talk to them, because they’re texting or on Instagram or whatever. This is a conscious decision we all make, but with Vic, he has no choice.” The cost of being a hybrid of man and machine, apparently, is an inability to go offline without going permanently offline. “He’s plugged into the Internet 24/7, and he can’t turn that off,” Walker adds. “Whereas, me, I can’t stay away from the Internet, it’s like a drug—and it’s a ridiculous drug when you think about it.”   The Book Will Look Amazing   “I feel like d’Artagnan in The Three Musketeers,” Walker says of his all-star art team on the series. Ivan Reis and Joe Prado have previously worked together on a number of high-profile series for DC, including Justice League, Green Lantern and the 2009 event series Blackest Night, and the pair now team with colorist Adriano Lucas to bring Cyborg to life. Walker is, to put it mildly, humbled by his partners. “D’Artagnan comes in, and there’s this amazing team already in place and he’s just this new guy. Ivan and Joe and Adriano are the three, and I’m the fourth Musketeer who doesn’t really know how to wield the sword yet.” He laughs, then adds, “They’re going to show me how to swash and buckle.”"

It just hurts and sucks."

These characters, no more than 5 years older than me, being able to do these things was incredible to me. That was the vision of Ultimate, to bring a fresh, younger perspective. Bendis' time writing comics is over, his golden age has passed, though he still does have a few good series left in him in the cases of Age of Ultron (not great, but not terrible) and Moon Knight. But stuff like this are just signs and symptoms Bendis should start being phased out. And it sucks, it really does. But it's what's happening, unfortunately."

""Being an adventurer and a superhero and all that is really cool, but wouldn’t it be cool to do that all out in space where he wanted to go in the first place?""

Ultimate Spider-man was the definitive rendition of the character for much of the Aughts.   The man can write talky stand around, deep introspective comics. He cannot, however, juggle a cast of more than 5 (including antagonists), write an actions sequence to save his life, (how many are left off page, happen between issues and have to be explained later, or encompass exactly one ill-defined two page spread?) or even write convincing voices for more than a handful of archetypes anymore.

I'm just glad they finally kicked him off all X-Men related books.   For that matter, Bendis is what's wrong with big summer events.  Every single one he ever did felt cheap, forced, and like a hand sticking out just waiting for Marvel fans to buy in.  If you want an example of comic legends that can create absolute shit, go read avengers volume 4.  Writing by Bendis, art by JRJR, what could go wrong?"

And /u/Mayhempspider's comment below sums up my other thoughts as well. It's not that we haven't read any of his other stuff, it's just that this is a constant issue with him and a good amount of his writing, exluding a few, such as his Moon Knight run and some pretty neat stuff like Age of Ultron. But when he misses, Bendis crashes hard. Example here, GotG. Do I hate him? No. Do I think the man can't write? No, obviously with the examples above. Do I think he should maybe read up on a beloved franchise before taking it over and shitting all over the previous? YES!"

Such a convoluted load of bollocks in order to introduce Samuel L Jackson into the 616 universe, and he completely fails to fill the shoes of both Nick Fury Sr and Ultimate Nick Fury.  Also, I may be biased because of how much I love Phantom Stranger and The Question, but DCs whole ""Trinity of Sin"" thing felt really forced. Nobody really cared about Pandora, and the Question's new mystical origin was awful (as was Phantom Stranger having any definitive origin whatsoever), but you could tell by how much they were pushing them in books like Justice League and Justice League Dark that someone up top thought that readers would (or should) be all about them.

That was a pretty damn serious book, and very well regarded.   That said, my second favourite take on the Inhumans was in the Fraction/Allred run on FF."
comicbooks,3e36ok,mike_incognito44,4,Tue Jul 21 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"(I had to Google ""trying to make fetch happen."")  Anyway, disagree with the ""despite not being any sort of fan favorite"" claim. Their initial series was an unexpected hit from a period where Marvel was trying all sorts of different things. And given that Marvel is notorious for canceling titles if its numbers fall too low, I find it hard to believe that they just kept releasing it ""just because.""  I suspect that we readers' perception of who is a favorite or not is highly biased by our own likes and dislikes.  That said, I'll go out on a limb and nominate Iron Man, despite his popularity outside of comics. He has been ubiquitous since the 60s as an Avenger, supplier to SHIELD, financier to multiple super-heroes, and go-to guy when someone needs some tech. But with a shallow bench of villains and precious few ""must-read"" stories, reader interest has hovered around ambivalence until Civil War, where it shot into intense dislike. His characterization is still suffering from injuries sustained during that period and I think it's why Marvel put their pinch-hitter on the title for the post-Secret Wars relaunch."

For something with superheroes but the emotional depth of Locke and Key, I highly recommend Astro City.  It's got characters who are not necessarily more realistic, but more human.  At one point the writer said he wanted to tell stories that happen in between the big super hero events.  What do you do when Thor throws your car at a monster? Does your insurance cover that?

It's written very much like a simple popcorn flick and it was probably intentionally done. One, they need something fun to bring new readers in; and two, it came out when DC needed to have an answer to Marvels cinematic plans.   Considering this was the first book for the New 52 I think it was a good move.

comicbooks,3dznwv,theodoubleto,7,Tue Jul 21 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of Moon Knight love on this sub, and it makes me so happy because he's one of my favourite characters. If you guys liked Ellis and Shavley's run, here are some more things Moon Knight you can look into.  Huston's run on V4. Super gritty and grimey, but Huston had a really interesting way of interpreting Moon Knight's status as an ambassador of the god of vengeance. Moon Knight talking with the Punisher is one of the highlights of the character, imo.  Bendis and Maleev's run. Twelve issues. You will read this and be so angry that it got cancelled after twelve issues. The art is beautiful, and Bendis' dialogue is perfect for Moon Knight's more psychotic personality. And the twists are just awesome. A lot of fun.  Doug Moench's original run and Resurrection War limited series. This will put into perspective how Moon Knight is supposed to be written. Are his powers mystical? Is he just completely fucking insane? Nobody knows, and that's the way it's supposed to be. Ellis fucking NAILED this with this scene. You're always supposed to wonder whether or not Moon Knight has been blessed by Khonshu or whether he's just some insanely lucky crazy person. There's supposed to be a sense of disbelief reading it, where you can rationalize what he's doing, but it doesn't make any sense unless he's a crazy person OR he's Khonshu's chosen one.  Is it one or the other? Is it both? Is it neither? It's never supposed to be clear, and that's why Moon Knight is such a fun character. He's supposed to make you go back, reread the whole comic, and still have no fucking idea how he just did what he did.  Okay now join me in a prayer to Khonshu: ""PLEASE LET THERE BE AN AWESOME MOON KNIGHT NETFLIX SHOW. PLEASE LET THERE BE AN AWESOME MOON KNIGHT NETFLIX SHOW. LET THE SHOWRUNNER BE SOMEONE FROM X-FILES OR ONE OF THE EARLY SEASONS OF FRINGE OR SOMETHING AWESOME LIKE THAT. PLEASE LET THERE BE AN AWESOME MOON KNIGHT NETFLIX SHOW."""

I read Ellis's full run yesterday. I couldn't put it down! And I'll be reading Wood's as soon as Amazon drops it on my doorstep. I'm a big fan of the Bendis/Maleev duo, so I'll definitely go back to their run, also. But this dude is so badass, I'll probably have his entire existence on my shelf before I'm done with him.   Oh, and yeah: ""PLEASE LET THERE BE AN AWESOME MOON KNIGHT NETFLIX SHOW. PLEASE LET THERE BE AN AWESOME MOON KNIGHT NETFLIX SHOW.

comicbooks,3dznwv,forkinanoutlet,5,Tue Jul 21 15:43:01 2015 UTC,Don't stop after the the first 6 that they did. The story after Shalvey and Ellis gets better and more personal.
comicbooks,3dznwv,Snicker56,4,Mon Jul 20 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"Cool. Just finished the first trade, and as much as the episodic nature so far as been really great, I want an arcing story."
comicbooks,3dznwv,LetsGoChuckTaylor,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree that it's better, but it's still very good.  It's really just that Ellis and Shalvey were doing a bunch of independent stories, and the next one was a continuous arc.  It's still very good, but I really think that Moon Knight needs a powerhouse writer to come in and do a limited series or something to cement the character for people who aren't familiar with him. Ellis' run was awesome, but if you don't know anything about the character, you don't really learn much from it.  I want to see somebody do a Moon Knight v. Bushman 6-issue run and really delve into his supporting cast and the confusing nature of his powers.   Doug Moench always intended for his powers to be ambiguous regarding their origins, and I think writers have always had fun going one way (mystical) or the other (psychological). I'd love to see somebody find a good balance of both without definitively saying it's one or the other."
comicbooks,3dznwv,NotHideyoshi,3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:42 2015 UTC,"I though Ellis did a phenomenal job setting up the character perfectly for first timers to Moon Knight. His run was my first Moon Knight reading, and I completely understood and got what was going on. He established the character well, while leaving just hints at something more, leaving just enough ambiguous for new readers, while still giving a good understanding of the character. This is most apparent in issue #6, where he brings in past characters from previous Moon Knight runs, and sets them up and explains them very well for first time readers. I learned a lot about the character during the first 6 issue run Ellis undertook, and going back and reading Bendis' and Charlie Huston runs just enforces what I'd learned during Ellis'. And I do believe Ellis' and Huston's runs struck a nice balance between mystical and psychological IMHO. Just my two cents, but I do agree that a nice new limited series would be cool to bring the character back into the new universe after Secret Wars. And if your looking for a Bushman v Moon Knight limited run, they did that already in Vengeance of Moon Knight."

comicbooks,3e0751,grntplmr,9,Tue Jul 21 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"From what I understand they're not going to sacrifice a good story for continuity. Continuity and tight editor control has killed many a promising story over the years. Basically ever since superheroes started doing team ups, cape comics have been trying to fit everything into an interconnected world, no matter how poorly the pieces might fit together. Having yearly events also means that promising stories get fucked with, and the ""new"" approach is really just a very old one: team ups and events can still happen, but it's not necessarily going to hog and take over every damn comic in the line up.  Think of it this way: Snyder and Capullo are killing it over on Batman, and in that comic Bruce Wayne is ""dead."" Yet on Justice League, Bruce Wayne is now a Bat God. These are two conflicting states of continuity. Where does one go before the other? Are they connected at all? In the previous approach the editors and writers and artists would have to brainstorm and think of some way out of such a mess, but now it's basically ""Batman is its own book with its own stories"" and ""Justice League is its own book with its own stories."" They're not worrying about whether or not all the pieces fit across the entire line up, because that way lies madness and it's crippled a lot of storytellers for far too many years.  And now to appease the people who are really, really into continuity, they can just wave a hand and say ""well that's on Earth 414534, and this one over here is Earth 5; now please let us get back to telling stories."""

comicbooks,3e0751,cabose7,3,Tue Jul 21 05:25:33 2015 UTC,The thing is though when I was a new reader a few years ago continuity is exactly the thing that kept me from getting into a lot of Marvel and DC stuff. I didn't want continuity because it meant I had to know everything about all these characters that had decades worth of history. Being thrown into universes that are so interconnected doesn't make new readers feel included it makes new readers feel very excluded.
comicbooks,3e0751,JackiesFetus,2,Tue Jul 21 04:20:30 2015 UTC,"I hear you but you do want some continuity. If flagship characters had the continuity of say 'South Park' where a support cast character or main character died every issue - many would abandoned the book. But like I stated some don't mind and you probably in that number but as a reader, one time store owner (retired) and old dude in general - I've seen more ppl read a book and leave once the continuity got wonky. New readers come in thinking it's like a novel with pictures and it's not, It's like a novel with multiple POVs and retcons that make what you read before voided and that puts new readers off quickly."

comicbooks,3e0751,morpheus_1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:47 2015 UTC,I have no problem with DC returning to an anything goes policy.  It allows a considerable amount of freedom for writers so long as they're not writing in the Earth Prime continuum.  One small bone to pick - Didio mentioned that DC is returning to the pre-Crisis sensibilities.   This is absolutely counter-factual to what was going on.  There was no methodology that lead to a uniform sensibility before Crisis because the whole point of Crisis was to tie up significant inconsistencies within the DC universe created by decades of a sensibility that continuity between flagship titles was neither important nor necessary.  What happened in Superman wasn't relevant to what happened in Tales of Suspense and that was fine.  We don't have to retcon the actual history.

comicbooks,3e0751,DMPunk,6,Tue Jul 21 07:56:40 2015 UTC,"what changed was how strictly they're holding to continuity across titles  Hal is back in the justice league even though in the GL title hes too busy to technically be in the league. Bruce is ""dead"" in the batman title, which allows them to tell an interesting story starring Gordon. In the Justice league title Bruce is acting as batman and they're able to tell their own story.  It's all about loosening continuity so that every book can tell the best story possible without being tied down by decisions that other writers make in their titles. That's a pretty significant change.  Plus they are experimenting with different styles, like the art direction in the new Dr. Fate, to see what people like.   DC is being more proactive to come out with stuff that people will enjoy instead of focusing on gimmicks like cross overs and big events. It's a huge shift in focus."
comicbooks,3e0751,Alquixx,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:31 2015 UTC,Justice League has always been exempt from the stories going on in the other books because it's the spine book of the DCU. And what does the art direction of Doctor Fate have to do with continuity?
comicbooks,3e0751,DMPunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:00 2015 UTC,"Hal hadn't been in the justice league book for a long time because he was the leader of the GLC in the green lantern books. They held strictly to continuity, so he was ""too busy"" to be an active member of the JL. So even if it is the ""spine of the DCU"" it wasn't free from being shackled by other books and other writers decisions.  Plus, even if justice league is the core book, other stories were still impossible to tell because they were restricted by continuity... and now they aren't.  and Dr. Fate has nothing to do with continuity. I said DC is being proactive and experimenting on different styles to add diversity to they're line and to see what people like. The art direction in doctor fate is just the most obvious case of this so far, in my opinion, so it's the example I used."

You made a broad comment so I gave a broad answer  But my point, and the point of the article, is that writers are more free to do what they want now. You can nitpick and say that Justice league specifically was never tied down by wonder woman specifically, but that's missing the bigger point. The specific book is irrelevant. Writers couldn't tell stories that they wanted to, in general, because they weren't allowed. Now they can. It's a shift in focus away from continuity and huge events. We're going to get better stories that can take more liberties with canon.  Better comics with better stories is a good change."

Like, to the point that when rereading it a lot of the ""weird"" stuff he did suddenly becomes super creepy.  And Kirkman just lets it build and build for 111 issues."

I'm no artist but I go back and re-read this for myself and try to draw some of the scene and catch all kinds of subtle nods to future stories. The book is just pure passion from the creative standpoint to the readers standpoint. My only bit that I would have liked to see completed is 'Image United' - It would have swell as fuck if these cats got their heads together and FINISH the book to add another side of adventure to Mark's belt. It's like the only blemish to the character but not to the book itself.

But, having read the series, i can confidently say that it becomes special when binge read. It constantly progresses, there is no true status quo, and you see a character truly grow and evolve, which is something that is pretty rare for modern comics. It reads like a roller coaster, but a roller coaster isn't very fun when you only watch a still from it. I guess what i'm saying is, it wouldnt look very fun to someone looking at a single page, or even a single issue, you have to put in the time to find what others have."

He doesn't need a tragic reason to be evil, because honestly, some people just are evil and I think people should be okay with that."

I know it's been enough time where we can look back at them with more perspective but I mean holy shit, what other superhero movies save for a very select few even compare to those? Focusing on just the second one, The Dark Knight has almost everything that's great about Batman. It tackles the relationship between Batman and the Joker, the tragic downfall of Dent and how this affects Bruce as Batman and as a friend of Harvey's, Bruce's juggle between his battle as Batman vs having a real life with the woman he loves, the tough choice he has to make between not losing yet ANOTHER person he loves vs. what's probably best for Gotham, and a lot more. Be as opinionated as you want but please don't be edgy for the sake of being edgy.

Naturally, DC has kept it in print for approximately forever now. Additionally, DC was supposed to cut him in on merchandising, but then claimed the merchandise was ""promotional material"" and therefore not subject to royalties. Moore never worked for DC  proper after that.  Then, he did work for Jim Lee's WildStorm back when it was part of Image, and Lee promised him his own imprint, America's Best Comics. In the process, WildStorm became part of DC again, but ABC hadn't yet launched. Moore reluctantly agreed to stick with WildStorm since the editorial influence from DC was supposed to be minimum. Then, DC had a vintage advertisement for League of Extraordinary Gentlemen pulled from the book. The advertisement was for a (genuine, no joke this existed) Marvel brand douche. Moore flipped his wig and left DC. Then there was a press release regarding V for Vendetta, if I remember it correctly, where some executive put words in Moore's mouth, and that's when he asked that he no longer be credited on movies relating to his comics, leaving Lloyd and Gibbons to get full credit for the adaptations of V and Watchmen.

We don't read physical books much anyway and the rest of the comicbook shelves are mostly filled with Japanese manga.  However, our market has moved onto the digital webcomics. Many of Korea-based giant websites, such as Naver-Line and Daum-Kakao have thier own digital weekly webcomics service. Not really sure about thier business model - probably based on ads. Last time I checked, Naver-Line has launched international webcomics service, webtoons.com.  For American comics, they do get translated and published here time to time. However, only a handful of audience exists for them. Among them are about a dozen of people, including me, who follows the scene in real-time via services like Comixology and such. Although I would like to see that change, the language barrier is basically too high."

Are those included in the domestic market you mentioned?"

comicbooks,3dzvb4,Makerpopo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:32:52 2015 UTC,"I've always been curious about why American comics aren't so popular here, because the characters themselves are ridiculously popular.  I teach in a kindergarten and I'm typing this from the break room, and from here I can see a Spider-man drinking flask, three Avengers backpacks, and a ton of Marvel and DC brand shoes on our shoe rack. Last halloween, the girls all cane dressed as witches or Disney princesses and the boys were almost exclusively Iron Man, Batman or Captain America.   I used to teach in a high school and the movies were really popular with the older kids too  You'd think with how stupidly successful the movies and their other merchandise has been that it might have kicked off at least a couple of passing interests in the comics but nope, they barely register here."
comicbooks,3dzvb4,ChickenInASuit,2,Tue Jul 21 04:05:21 2015 UTC,"Well here's a simple answer: They only care about movies. At least in America the characters have been a part of pop culture for a long time. Here it's just about the movies, and many wouldn't even care about the books themselves other than reading Wikis and stuffs for boasting purpose.  It has to do with two tendencies from Korean audiences. First we are (not me but anyways) so used to Japanese style of drawing comics that so many find the American styles strange. Well-proportioned art from someone like Jim Lee and Ivan Reis is better received, but I've seen many people struggling over Dave Gibbons's art for Watchmen, and my friends had no idea what to think about my personal favorites like Michael Lark, Sean Phillips or Garry Brown. (""Why is the line so unclear?"" ""He can't even draw straight"" etc.) It's just me, but sometimes I think that our audiences have only one standard of thinking about comic arts, whether the characters are beautiful or not. Very few people think about the atmosphere and ambience that various types of lines and colors add to storytelling, which is what I love most about American and European comics. It's a huge pity.  Another problem (which is WAAAAY bigger) is that people will not pay for comics. Paying for services and arts is a very recent idea in most Asian countries outside of Japan. In case of Korea, the concept of piracy started to settle in only very recently, as we just started buying movies from IPTV services, games from Steam, etc. Comics is not reaching there yet, and that's why webcomics appeared. Comic artists turned to webcomics because people wouldn't buy their books. There's Lezhin and many other Webcomic services trying to change that, but it's far behind movies and games."
comicbooks,3dzvb4,team56th,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really wonder why that is. Maybe the dominant forms of comics here are Japanese manga and webcomics, and that the most of the western comics differ greatly from what we are used to.  I remember that after the V for Vendetta movie came out, I bought the hardcover graphic novel. However I was not really impressed. Maybe it was TOO different. Maybe it looked like it was too dated."

comicbooks,3dzvb4,Fafnesbane,5,Mon Jul 20 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"The Israeli comic book scene is rather small. Its history is richer with comic strips than it is with comic books, though that's turning around these days.  To my knowledge, there are only three comics shops in Israel: Comikaza and two branches of the Eisner-winning Comics n' Vegetables (one of which is within walking distance of Comikaza's lone store). Bookstores tend to carry a small selection of comics, mostly classic Vertigo stuff like Sandman and Fables with some translated Bone or Shazam: Monster Society of Evil copies lying around as well.  As far as creators go, we've got Rutu Modan, who broke out with Exit Wounds a few years back, and Assaf and Tomer Hanuka, whose The Divine is coming out soon (though not in Hebrew, as they chose not to look for an Israeli publisher). Assaf's The Realist was first published in weekly increments in an Israeli daily newspaper. Uri Fink's Zbeng, a high-school slice-of-life comic, is probably the most long-lasting Israeli comic, though to my knowledge Fink's never had much success outside of Israel like Modan and the Hanuka brothers. Other than that, a lot of Israeli work is independent and very small-scale.  As far as characters go, Fink also did Super Shlumper (lit. Super Slob), a superhero character with a pair of boxers on his head who managed to overcome adversity by sheer strokes of luck; and Mike Netzer, who worked for Marvel & DC in the 70's and has some Israeli roots, created Uri On in 1987 - a super-patriotic character which seems like it was traced from Superman covers and plastered with Jewish insignia."

comicbooks,3dzvb4,meg_abyte,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"Spain here. Comics are actually a staple of our culture, ever since at the beginning of the 20th century the first comic book magazines (with Spanish-created characters and stories) appeared in our country. So much so that one of the Spanish words for ""comic book"" is ""tebeo"", after TBO, the name of probably the most famous magazine of all.  In the dictatorship times superheroes were banned and comics were censored, which led to the creation of some of the most famous Spanish characters of all times. On the one hand there were pulp-magazine-style adventures like 'El guerrero del antifaz' and 'El capitán trueno', and on the other there was slapstick comedy like 'Zipi y Zape' or the very famous 'Mortadelo y Filemón'.  Towards the end of the dictatorship (70s) the censorship was less intense, which allowed the publication of satire magazines like 'Hermano Lobo' or 'El Papus', as well as imported superhero comics. Then, when Franco died there was an explosion of freedom that led to the creation of more adult and subversive stuff published in magazines like 'El Jueves' and 'El Víbora'.  Unfortunately the market saturated shortly after, and in the 90s most magazines disappeared. Comics were still being published, though, both imported and national. A new generation of authors brought comedy titles like the very nerdy 'Fanhunter' series and serious books like the multiple-awarded 'Arrugas'. The naughties also saw the birth of many Spanish webcomics, some of which are still running and successful like 'Eh, tío!' and 'El Listo'. There is also a long-standing tradition of political cartoons, which are pretty popular on the Internet.  Right now there is a fairly big comic reader base and, aside from the Spanish books, you can find translated editions of almost every title from the big American publishers (Marvel, DC, Image, Dark Horse), as well as a lot of manga (not just the big shonen names but also the less-known ones), and, of course, a great deal of Franco-belgian stuff.  tl;dr We like comics a lot."

Most of them are either influenced by major shonen mangas or a comedy without story arc, but still it's pretty varied. If you count webcomics in, it's not that bad.  One problem I have is that they usually suck at writing dialogues. Everybody focuses on settings and characters and punchlines too much, that in the end the rhythm of each line and the tension of conversation are completely ignored, making almost every line convoluted. Not all are like that, but it's a general problem nobody is trying to fix."

There was another company which published stories about a character called 'Chacha Choudhary', who was a super-intelligent old man, and he had a sidekick from Jupiter called Sabu who did all the physical work etc. That particular company also used to 'borrow' characters from DC and Marvel etc to write their own stories.

comicbooks,3dykr9,Luchadeer,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:07 2015 UTC,At the very least The Valiant TP. This sets up the universe to where Book of Death is. Perhaps also Divinity TP as the character is hinted in #1 of BoD as having a role at somepoint. Also to understand who the Big Bad in BoD (I think he finally gets revealed in issue #3 of BoD in a couple months) is all about you really should read Shadowman.

Lemire's got a great handle on the characters - his Clint sounds like Clint and his Kate Barton is awesome, and I really like the way he writes Barney and Clint as kids. The art switch between the two time periods is also really effective, and the two styles are a pretty cool showcase for Perez's art skills."

comicbooks,3dzzdy,suss2it,4,Mon Jul 20 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"As a writer and fan of Guillermo del Toro, I respect that he is completely entitled to work on anything he desires, and that I can't demand he work on one project instead of another. I hold no ill will to him over that decision. I also respect that he'd actually want to work on the JLD film himself, and not just pass it off to another director.    As a fan of the first Pacific Rim, I am looking forward to more crazy robot vs. monster fights.    As a realist, I did not expect Justice League Dark's film to ever get even so far as being greenlighted.    As a fanboy, I am FUCKING PISSED that the goddamn kaiju movie whose story had a perfectly tight and reasonable ending is getting an unnecessary sequel instead of my favorite characters finally getting their chance in the spotlight."
comicbooks,3dzzdy,vivvav,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"Relevant bits  On Hellboy 3   “The hard fact is that the movie’s going to need about $120 million and there’s nobody knocking down our doors to give it to us,” he told The Daily Beast ahead of his Hall H return, where a new Crimson Peak trailer earned an enthusiastic reception. “It’s a little beyond Kickstarter,” he laughed. “It would be great to complete the trilogy,” he said, “But in a way I don’t see the world—the industry—supporting that idea.”   On Justice League Dark   del Toro had split with the DC superhero team-up Justice League Dark. According to del Toro, that decision came down to a scheduling conflict with Pacific Rim 2, which he’s in pre-production on ahead of a 2017 release. “Warners liked the script, they were very enthusiastic and wanted to green-light it but they wanted it to coincide with the shoot of Pacific Rim 2,” he said. “I was put in a very difficult place facing a difficult choice, and I chose to do Pacific Rim 2.”"
comicbooks,3dzzdy,jovenjams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:30 2015 UTC,Such disappointing news. Del Torro was even eyeing Matt Ryan to reprise his role as Constantine for Justice League Dark! I really enjoyed Pacific Rim but I would've liked to see what he could do with a JLD film.
comicbooks,3dzzdy,farceur318,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:45 2015 UTC,"Part of loving del Toro is accepting that only about 5% of the projects he talks about doing ever end up getting made. The guy dreams big and moves on quickly when things don't go right. I had a feeling that JLD was never going to happen, but I have complete faith that we'll see Hellboy 3 someday somehow, even if it's a Fury Road situation and we have to wait a couple more decades."

Lando looks to be fun going forward. Vader Down will be interesting. All in all I'm satisfied. These are actually what got me back into reading."

comicbooks,3e2a98,kw1nn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan, sadly. I really wanted to like these series but I just can't. The characters do not sound like themselves. It feels like a poor attempt at some Star Wars fan fiction, and I usually like Aaron's work. On top of that, the story was heavily decompressed. I swear, the first four issues could have easily been compressed into one issue. I haven't read Darth Vader yet, save for the first issue, but I did like it a bit better. Gilles seemed to understand Vader a bit more, so his voice sounded correct, but the story did not sound like a Darth Vader story. The first two issues of Leia were decent, probably the series that has felt the closest to what I feel Star Wars is, but I haven't read the rest yet. Haven't read Lando yet, and I have no interest in Kanan.   Overall, I found Brian Wood's run to be better and more interesting, at least at first. Between the poor voicing for characters, the slow pacing, and the plot threads that mess up continuity, I can't enjoy any of these series so far. I'll give Darth Vader another shot, if I can find the issues, and the minis seem decent. At least I know the art will always be great."
comicbooks,3e2a98,Nealman7398,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:40 2015 UTC,I would second sticking with Vader. It plays on the Vaders we've seen in both the trilogies. I won't say any more but he feels like a very transitional Vader. Something we've only really seen in Anakin and final act ROTJ Vader.

comicbooks,3e0cqt,DementiaPrime,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:31 2015 UTC,There is no new reboot. You can start on any book from last month and the month before they even put out free Sneak Peeks for almost all their books so you can try all those out for free and continue reading whichever ones you liked.
comicbooks,3e0cqt,medacomix15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:00:55 2015 UTC,Awesome! So every month is a new adventure or something like that? I kind of always saw them as a running universe because if you jump in the middle you're not getting a lot of the personal connections from previous issues
comicbooks,3e0cqt,ThomsYorkieBars,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"No, more of a any book is a easy jumping on point when it is the beginning of a arc. So it was just timed up that last month every book would either be a #1 or just the first issue of a arc. And the free Sneak Peeks take place before those arcs and pretty much are the books creative team doing stories that tell what is going on and what direction the books are moving in."
comicbooks,3e0cqt,medacomix15,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:12 2015 UTC,The beauty of the new 52 is that there are 52 new #1 issues from which you can start

I suppose my question is really where is the best place to start to get a grasp on it all? Or does it not work like that? I mean obviously the universe isn't not linear like a series of novels, but there's gotta be a best place to start from right?"

comicbooks,3dwila,hoodie92,6,Mon Jul 20 15:49:34 2015 UTC,And I think that's what I'm excited for. We've seen Alfred pretty much portrayed as old and good natured in live action so far. I welcome an Alfred that's a little younger and has more of an edge to him.

comicbooks,3dxp8e,the_HeyThere_member,10,Mon Jul 20 23:04:56 2015 UTC,Probably because Wright was involved and so spirited about the project. This movie was his baby before Marvel had even started up the MCU.

But Ant-Man couldn't top Cap or Thor from 2011?  It's either the lack of recognition of ant-man (very good chance), or a decline in popularity of comic book properties (less likely)."

Well, sort of. I think--as another analyst put it--Guardians rose above anything that might have dragged it down because of the quality of the movie.  In other words, if Guardians had been decent instead of excellent (like Ant-Man), no one would be talking about how super successful it was.  Plus it sort of served as an appetizer for people hungry for Star Wars."

But it did get what it got on a smaller budget, which given the special effects was surprising.  I think it's lack of recognition, and alot of people being in wait-and-see mode, either because they weren't sure about a hero that talks to ants and shrinks, or the mid-shooting replacement of the director, or concerns about the Wasp. For example, I have a female friend who is refusing to see the movie because ""they fridged Janet in the MCU"".   Oh, and Minions.  So.... yeah. Ant-Man had alot of things working against it. I think that now that it's out and getting mostly positive reviews, we'll see a strong 2nd week increase and it'll beat out Pixels.... I hope.   God, I hope."

Except that Bucky was an actual character who was part of the story and did stuff. It's not wrong to have one character's death motivate another- the problem is when dying is the only way the character affects the story."
comicbooks,3dxp8e,Doomsayer189,6,Mon Jul 20 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"There's not obligation to have that character in the movie at all. She exists in the past from where the movie took place, anyways.

comicbooks,3dxydg,SaturdaySmile,28,Mon Jul 20 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"I've written about my disdain regarding this situation before, but the real story behind everything is Editor in Chief Jim Shooter going off the rails and John Byrne deciding to get revenge.  In X-Men 201, Claremont wrote Cyclops out of the X-Men, and it was his intention to let Scott have a happy ending with Madelyne and Nathan.  Meanwhile, X-Factor had been in works for a while, and originally going to have Dazzler, not Jean, as the female member with the rest of the O4.  When John Byrne heard this plan, he told reminded Roger Stern of the a fan theory they had heard on how to bring Jean back.  Byrne hated Claremont, and Stern and Shooter thought Claremont was a prima donna, so they plugged in the Jean revival (every wonder why her return was done in FF and Avengers) into comics Claremont had no involvement in and boom, X-Factor 1.  No one bothered to tell these plans to Claremont until they were well in motion.  Reports vary about this part, but the news was broken to Claremont on a Friday night when he was drunk by Ann Nocenti.  Some people say it was intentional, because they wanted Claremont to quit, others just say there was never a good time to break the news.  Either way, X-Men 201 was already well in the works and not in a place to get changed.  Back then, comics weren't delayed....an issue was publish at deadline, and if the regulars didn't have something ready, a fill in was put in at the last second.    Claremont nearly quit, tried to propose ideas to prevent Jean from returning, but Shooter shot them all down.  He then decided to let Claremont write some flashback scenes to lay some groundwork of the Jean return as a bone, while basically writing the specifics of the return in FF and Avengers.  This really pissed off Bryne, and it actually led to him leaving Marvel and taking over Superman.  Claremont felt Scott wasn't salvageable after this, and avoided writing him whenever possible after that.  It would take a truly talented writer to fix this situation.  Bob Layton and Louise Simonson were not those writers.  They did the best that they could given the circumstances.  Inferno was just one of the many ""fixes"" (Maddie was an evil clone all along!) to try and address it so that Scott doesn't come off as an asshole.  Your mileage my vary on whether it has succeeded or not.  This was also the beginning of the end for Jim Shooter.  When he first became EIC, he was very good at keeping an extremely tight continuity among Marvel.  As the years went on, sales and commercial concerns started dictating stories more and more.  The Shooter of 1980 would not have allowed Jean to return, but bringing the O5 back in a book was a surefire hit, so it happened.  Having your staff hate you, but keeping sales up is one thing.  1986 was the year of the ""New Universe"" which was his pet project, and it bombed.  By early 1987, Shooter was fired.  TLDR:  John Bryne wanted to stick a knife in Chris Claremont, and the Marvel high ups at the time thought an O5 book would sell well, details be damned."
comicbooks,3dxydg,xw1,6,Mon Jul 20 14:28:40 2015 UTC,"Byrne hated Claremont, and Stern and Shooter thought Claremont was a prima donna, so they plugged in the Jean revival (every wonder why her return was done in FF and Avengers) into comics Claremont had no involvement in and boom, X-Factor 1.   Kurt Busiek came up with the fan theory. He shared it with Roger Stern, years before Busiek ever worked at Marvel in any capacity. It then was relayed from Stern to Byrne to Shooter. Maybe the dislike for Claremont was shared by all three, I don't know - but the story was shared across Stern and Byrne's books partly because of how the idea was relayed from party to party, I'd wager.    I do know that Byrne wanted to show the Phoenix as being evil all along in the flashback in FF, but Claremont got to write that scene instead. Hence the weird credits in FF #286.    With regards to Shooter, Buisek has said that his mandate all along that was that Jean could not return from the dead, unless it was done in such a way that she was not responsible for genocide. Busiek's idea got around that. And then when it was relayed to Shooter when X-Factor was about to be launched, he did decide to put it in as the big story in the premiere issue, whereas Layton and Guice apparently wanted to let it ride out for a year or so before Jean returned.    X-Factor and it's genesis is such a clusterfuck."
comicbooks,3dxydg,rpawson5771,7,Mon Jul 20 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"And of course, Busiek had a letter published in the famous Kitty Pryde Christmas issue where he says denounces the entire Dark Phoenix storyline.  Only other time I can think of a similar situation was Geoff Johns and Superboy.  I personally think that this exact moment is the point where Marvel began its 90s shittyness.  There were still plenty of good stories published going forward, but this is the first time I can think of someone acting completely out of character because it made sense for sales purposes.  A lot of crossovers and books were written over the next 15 years trying to make Scott look like he was completely in the right, until by the time of Morrison's run when they just gave up trying entirely.  As I've been reading more recent X-Men stuff, I've decided to just get over it.  When I started reading comics again and posting here, I was in the process of reading all of Claremont's run.  Scott's actions were pretty fresh in my head and I couldn't believe how no one every gave him crap for it.  But looking back, these were editorially mandated decisions that a lot of people disagreed that happened decades ago.  Attempts were made to address it when it was fresh.  I always rather read a good story than be a slave to continuity, and Scott is definitely more ""interesting"" today than he was in the bronze age.  I get annoyed how every time Hank Pym gets called out for hitting Wasp.  I'd probably get annoyed if Scott was getting called out on this all the time too."

Jean just took in stride because she was becoming the Phoenix and told him to be happy (because if he wasn't the whole world would end )   So the tally is - first wife , who looks like his dead girlfriend, is abandoned with his son. It's ok because she was really a clone of his girlfriend  and became the evil goblin queen. His son was also sent to the future so swinging bachelor cyclops wouldn't be tied down.   This whole time he also emotionally abandons a alternate timeline daughter who just wanted a family...  Then after coming to terms with all that and being back with Jean for a bit, he starts day dreaming about Psylocke while around his psychic girlfriend with a history of destroying planets.  Real smooth.   After all that, Jean proposes to him and they get married. Their honeymoon? A future version of his alternate timeline daughter brings then further into the future to raise his son from his ex girlfriend. Just what a girl wants to do on her honeymoon I imagine.  Then cyclops gets possessed and Jean and his kids scour the globe looking for him.   Soon after, Jean shows signs of possibly being possessed by a cosmic force and Scott runs to Emma Frost to discuss his feelings of inadequacy and they begin an affair   Jean then fully manifests as a near omnipotent cosmic force who came into existence and nearly destroyed the earth just  to tell Scott it was ok to make out with Emma at Jean's grave.   Then a time displaced younger version of himself and Jean appears. Young Jean pulls the whole story from his mind, now acutely  aware of all the intimate moments between herself and this older guy, she still hangs around him he enters the mid life crisis stage of his life   At some point in secret wars, Doom will reveal the previous universe was created only to keep Cyclops supplied with hot telepath love interests and almost forever free of responsibility"

There's SO MUCH THERE to work with; it's a shame that short-sightedness and poor execution squandered it.  Personally, I think far more damage has been done to Scott's character by running away from this storyline. Scott is way more interesting and way more relatable as a guy who feels this overwhelming pressure to be a paragon of morality and mutant righteousness, a guy who has had the responsibility of protecting the lives of his teammates since he was a teenager, a guy who tries to do the right thing and fails sometimes, a guy who selfishly grabbed at a second chance with his first love and who both can't forgive himself for it and would do it all over again if given the chance.  Scott fucked up. Accept that. Lean into it. Let it enrich the character.   It's also why sticking him with Emma post-Morrison was a mistake. Trying to legitimize that relationship retroactively justifies Scott's actions when it would be so much more interesting if they WEREN'T justified.  That said, at least running away from it prevented it from becoming his single identifiable trait, the way woman-beating became Hank Pym's or getting cancelled a million times became Alpha Flight's."
comicbooks,3dyggn,wayne_fox,19,Mon Jul 20 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"I actually think a recent Grant Morrison interview where he's talking about his upcoming Wonder Woman Earth One comic is a good look at addressing this. Also, yes, almost universally superhero stories boil down to ""give them something to punch"", but I think it's silly to say that it ""couches itself in moral rhetoric"". To continue with the Morrison connection: All-Star Superman has Superman punching stuff, but you're an idiot if you think that's all it's about. That's like saying Science Fiction or Fantasy can never be taken seriously because they aren't set in the real world. You deal with genre trappings, sure, but that doesn't diminish the quality of the work.   That's the problem with a lot of discussions around Alan Moore, because I'm pretty sure we were reading the same discussion. In a way, he's right, and he usually is. The top comment is about his position on how terrifying the inherent pseudo-fascism of Superheroes is in a post-9/11 world, and he's right. But he also takes a concern or an issue he has with a genre and very quickly shifts that into a moralizing: ""and therefore the medium is bad"", which is as completely useless as ignoring the genre's problems."
comicbooks,3dyggn,Arkadii,6,Mon Jul 20 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"I think there's an important distinction to be made, Moore has never had a problem with comics as a medium (see his HARDTalk interview available on youtube), he's always been a big proponent of the value of the sequentially illustrated storytelling medium, but his problem resides with the dominant genre of the industry: superheroes.  It also doesn't help that he has deep seated (and imo, just) issues with the big firms which dominate the industry, but again, that is a problem external of the medium itself."

It could be true that some people only like superheroes for the violence, but even if it is, why is violence bad? I happen to enjoy the extreme and excessive violence in comic books, but why is it bad to enjoy such things? It's just fun to me, but how is this any different from having a sexual fetish of some kind? I'm not saying I get off on it, but it is something I like to see, am I no more a depraved degenerate than a fetishist? I'm not hurting anyone by reading Invincible or Spawn.   They are not rational, they are not reasonable   When heroes solve things with violence, it's usually because they have no other option, the circumstances are arranged to such a point that violence is the only rational decision. Heroes and villains as a whole aren't rational or reasonable, but they are irrational because of many other things and not because ""fighting is bad""   They exist so that individuals can say ""I wish that I was the most important person. I wish that I alone could solve all the problems. I wish that everyone thought that I was great, that I was heroic, that I was valuable.""   He's a bit misguided here: superheroes don't exist for that reason. Superheroes exist so individuals can say ""I wish there was someone out there who was a hero, someone people could believe in and count on, someone who could protect the defenseless and punish evil, I wish there was someone out there who was a spectacular, amazing, incredible person with powers that were just the same."" All of these aren't conceivable in the real world, so that is why superheroes exist. I don't want to be Cable, I've never wanted to be Cable, that thought never crossed my mind once. I've always thought of Nathan Summers as Cable or Clark Kent as Superman, never of myself as those characters. It isn't a desire to be amazing, spectacular or incredible, it's a desire to find someone who is. Someone who is amazing, spectacular and incredible outside of a world where that isn't achievable. Everybody needs someone to believe in, everybody needs someone to be inspired by.

How is Moore's problem with violence as the paramount characteristic of these characters the juvenile perspective? The obsession with the power fantasy is something even a child (hence: juvenile) can identify with and appreciate. Maturation necessarily implies criticizing view points and reaching out for new solutions. Or at the very least, more nuanced perspectives of conflict resolution.  I read comics, and will still even read a good superhero story (even a superhero story can tackle some good points, or make a statement) but it's pointless to maintain the illusion that solutions provided by the typical superhero go beyond ""I'm right and just, and I can make the world resemble my rightness by superior force."""
comicbooks,3dyggn,ohoni,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:45 2015 UTC,"You don't know how the genre (read: superhero) tropes of violence to solve problems relates to masculinity? It is coded in our DNA and hormonal production of testosterone to conquer our enemies, most typically (and originally) through violence.   But that is true of both men and women, it has nothing to do with masculinity.   It's worth noting that while violence is most often a component of a comic issue, it is rarely actually the solution. Violence either serves to give the characters time to find an actual solution (which usually involves reasoning and trickery), or it serves merely as the capstone after reasoning has brought them to their opponent. Very few conflicts in comics are resolved using only violence.  Characters that do try to exclusively use violence to enforce their world view tend to find failure in this."
comicbooks,3dyggn,pqrk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"A characters powers aren't exclusively used for violence.   Example: All-Star Superman, that little girl who is ready to commit suicide, an image which gets reposted on this sub constantly. Not violent, but still a power fantasy. Supermans ability to know every detail related to her personal issue, AND fly up there to stop her just in the knick of time, is enabled EXCLUSIVELY by his powers. It is in effect, still a power fantasy. There's no deep discussion on the reasons for suicidal thoughts or people that suffer from depression, no explication on coping mechanisms or dealing with the issue in the real world, no chance of failure. Its just a feel good moment because Superman does the thing we all wish we could do, solve a complex problem very simply. That's still a power fantasy.  As for this bit:   But that is true of both men and women, it has nothing to do with masculinity.   Women are certainly capable of violence, and violence is a human trait as much as anything, but the long history of brute force belongs to men, and the model of ""extreme physical power"" and idolization of this archetype is a male invention. Certainly, there are women in feel this way as well, but that gender did not invent, nor does it embody, that view.  Of course, there are men who don't fit this mold of masculinity, and there are women who do. But in the long, long, long (and recorded, reference-able) history of mankind, that's masculinity to a T. We can change what it means to be masculine constantly, but we cannot simply ignore its historical position."
comicbooks,3dyggn,ohoni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:57 2015 UTC,"A characters powers aren't exclusively used for violence.    I never argued that they were, but I think it's fair to say that almost all superhero storylines involve violence at some point in the process. I don't think that needs to be defended one way or the other. I was just pointing out that the inclusion of violence is 1. Not particularly masculine (women are no less violent than men, given the opportunity), and 2. not something readers should have to justify or be ashamed of for enjoying.  Now, would it be possible to tell superhero stories without any violence? Sure, there's plenty they could do instead, but they would tend to be more boring. Violence is nice simple action, it builds adrenalin which engages the viewer.   So long as no real people are actually being hurt by violence, there's no harm in it.   Women are certainly capable of violence, and violence is a human trait as much as anything, but the long history of brute force belongs to men, and the model of ""extreme physical power"" and idolization of this archetype is a male invention. Certainly, there are women in feel this way as well, but that gender did not invent, nor does it embody, that view.   Nonsense. Men don't ""own"" the concept of violence and women ""borrow"" it, violence is equal to both genders. In humans, men are more often participants in large scale violence, because male physical development makes them, on average, more capable in physical violence (ie a man is more likely to be stronger than a women, and therefore better at wearing heavy armor and swinging heavy swords around all day), but the impulse for violence is no different, and as technology has leveled the physical differences between the sexes, women have begun to take up a more and more equal role in combat."

There are some very powerful moments in the story that involve violence, but it's not really portrayed positively at all in those cases, the heroes can't just solve their problems with brute force, and most of it is about ideas and there's not really that much action in the book itself.  it's sort of a recurring thing with works in the action genre that are particularly well-regarded. i.e if terminator was just a thriller/action movie it would still be cool but the whole love story thing is what a lot of people end up remembering and what elevates it in most people's minds."

But saying that's all that ever happens in comics is like saying every dessert tastes the same as the reason you don't like cake. It just isn't true.  Fantastic Four are explorers, '05 X-Factor is a detective agency. Neither of them use violence to solve every problem and even some of the bigger names like Spider-Man (who is known for his villains and their battles) will still have to use something other than his fists to see himself through to the other side of an issue.   Ultimately though, people like action and to a certain degree, there's nothing wrong with it."

comicbooks,3dyggn,BluWacky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not an uber-comics expert by any means, but there are a lot of things to untangle here.  Some thoughts:  i) Superman, as originally conceived, does not seem to me to be about punching things very hard.  Superman is undoubtedly a fantasy figure, but an aspirational one; he's the kind of man you want to be, a champion of justice and all-round goodness.  The ""ideal"" of Superman is that you read his stories to see him save the day, yes - but that's what's important, not any violence involved in it.  It's a power fantasy, sure, but although NOW maybe people read his comics to see him punch/laser stuff real good it's not all there is to the story.  Perhaps the Superman story ""Secret Identity"" by Kurt Busiek is worth mentioning here, in that the Clark Kent of that story is deliberately non-violent, although it's certainly still an exploration of power fantasy (or at least a certain kind of fantasy...)  ii) The tricolonic idea of superheroes as irrational/unreasonable/unjustifiable is a difficult one.  What should Kamala do, rationally, given that she exists in a world of fantasy?  Perhaps she would choose not to fight crime - maybe not use her powers at all.  But where would the story be if that happened?  She sees what she does as a responsibility and one justifiable in utilitarian terms, perhaps - what she does produces the most good for the most people.  It doesn't mean her stories aren't based around violence, of course, but what she is doing seems eminently justifiable.  iii) Being a superhero is a very specific kind of heroism.  Penelope in Homer's Odyssey is heroic, but in a specifically Greek (and uncomfortable to a modern audience) way - intelligent, cunning, and willing to wait for her husband for twenty years while he beats people up and sleeps with sea nymphs and witches.  She is not, however, a superhero.  It's not even enough to have vast supernatural power, else we would be calling John Constantine, Tommy Taylor or Sandman superheroes (Sandman, I suppose, technically is one...).  The toolkit of a superhero usually involves abilities that are offensive in capability and proportional to the foes they will face.  Question - if you just had Batman acting as a detective and he never punched anyone, would he still be a superhero?  Even if he wore the costume?  iv)  I think there's a conflation of two ideas here - the ""power fantasy"" and the ""wish fulfilment"" aspect.  Perhaps when you're young you want to be Superman/Batman/whatever - lord knows I still want to be Charles Xavier - but I think the power fantasy aspect is not necessarily about wishing YOU were that sort of person but imagining that such things could happen or are happening.  Sorry, lots of confused thoughts here.  I guess superheroes ARE a dumb concept, but dumb concepts can be explored with nuance :)"
comicbooks,3dyggn,Droid85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"It's generally the point of every story for you to fantasize yourself in the shoes of the protagonist, and every protagonist has a struggle they must overcome. In my opinion, humanity's greatest struggle is overcoming our primal, pre-civilized instincts that conflict with rational thought. Fiction is a great way for us to live out our fantasies without the real life consequences."
comicbooks,3dyggn,NidStyles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"An important thing to understand about Superheroes is that they are for the most part allegorical. Superheroes are symbols, representing things larger than themselves. A Batman comic is not about whether he can punch the Joker in the face harder than the Joker can punch him, its about the things that Batman stands for coming into conflict with the things that the Joker stands for.   The violence is just the set dressing used to draw in the audience, but the meat of the story is themes, and on a thematic level superheroes are intensely moral. Superman teaches you that if you do good everyman can be a Superman. Spider-Man teaches you that with great power comes great responsibility. The X-Men teach you that the things that make you different are the things that make you powerful.  Of course not all superheroes are like this, some are just nihilistic power fantasies for manboys but when the Superhero genre is done right its not about being more powerful than your enemies its about being a better, more heroic person than you once were."

comicbooks,3dyggn,Batsy22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"The Boys by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertsonr addresses this pretty well, though in extremely graphic and NSFW ways.  The comment you posted is correct: Superhero comics are a violent power fantasy. However, comics and other fictional media, including our imaginations, are places where we can exercise our fantasies without having to enact them, making them arguably safe, so I wouldn't expect a comic reader to be more or less violent than anyone else. the idea that comics create delinquency was put forth by the people who wanted to ban horror and crime comics in the 50's. It was thoroughly debunked. There was a recent study that demonstrated heavy metal fans from the 80's turned out to be more well-adjusted than their contemporaries who listened to other styles of music. I'm sure something similar could be said about comic readers.  Last thing: I personally believe the re-mainstreaming of the Superhero cliche is due to the actual suffering and helplessness that the average global citizen is experiencing. We are helplessly drawn to the idea that justice prevails, the bullies will be cast off, all in the name of an impeachable code of values, delivered by the business end of a super-powered fist. It protects us from having to deal with our actual f/emasculation."
comicbooks,3dyggn,LeCount,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"You can say that about pretty much any genre. Often times the main character is relatable so that you can picture yourself going on the adventure. It's escapism. But we don't say every genre is just escapism just because that can be part of the appeal.   Furthermore, I don't think it makes sense to say that people read comics ""just for violence."" That makes no sense to me. Violence is part of a lot of things.   In the case of superheroes, it's the idea of seeing characters dealing with problems in a larger than life scale. So Batman's story is about everyone's struggle to find meaning in tragedy but on a much bigger scale."

Cameron's stewart art style is perfect for a Captain Marvel book.

I know some people are of the opinion that Grant Morrison's writing style with comics comes across too convoluted and overly complicated but i felt that didn't apply for this particular issue. It was pretty straightforward and I'm sure a nice call back to the original Captain Marvel comics.   It all just comes together brilliantly in my opinion.

Then it's someone's adaptation of a character concept. What's more, it's a good story and a great adaptation. I've actually found that people underestimate the Dark Knight Returns Superman.  He's not just a stooge, the world is going to hell, and he's doing his best to save it. What is he supposed to do, overthrow the President? Put a government he agrees with in power? Why don't you just put the whole world in a bottle? Superman believes the best in people, and believes that whatever differences he may have with a government, it's still his duty to help people however he can. Batman, for the most part, has lost faith in humanity and tries to save the few he think deserves it.  As far as their fight goes, this isn't ""bullshit"" either. Superman is obviously pulling his punches, he doesn't want to kill Bruce. He's not stupid, he's facing an internal as well as external struggle. Batman isn't having this struggle, he's not there to save or convince Superman. As he puts it in another fight in Hush inspired by DKR, ""Deep down, Clark's essentially a good person... and deep down, I'm not.""  edit: see /u/Missing_Username 's comment for a much better defense of DKR Superman."

comicbooks,3dyif5,Doctor_Arkham,0,Mon Jul 20 21:03:05 2015 UTC,I disagree. The only thing about Superman in Miller's Dark Knight series I like is the detached way he refers to humanity- particularly when he's discussing life as a superhuman with his daughter.   I just find the idea that Superman would become a government flunky to be ridiculous and not a reasonable interpretation of the character by any stretch of the imagination.
comicbooks,3dyif5,MisterBastahrd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:46 2015 UTC,It's a character assassination of one to prop the other up.
comicbooks,3dyif5,Missing_Username,27,Mon Jul 20 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe, if you ignore the actual story and cherry pick only the negative to create a perceived 'assassination'.  This is a future in which, after a Mutant Registration Act/Civil War event, everyone in the League except Superman apparently throws their hands up. Diana returns to her people. Hal goes to the stars. Bruce retires. Everyone but Superman turns their back on the people, but it's a character assassination of Superman.  Bruce spends the entire story playing the unhinged old man, unnecessarily crippling small time criminals, allowing Two-Face henchmen to die in the second helicopter with no remorse, endangering a completely untrained new adolescent. Meanwhile, Superman visits him multiple times attempting to reason with him before his actions escalate to the point where he'll have to intervene. But it's a character assassination of Superman.  Superman spends the bulk of DKR trying to prevent the US and the USSR from starting a nuclear war. He nearly dies trying to save people from an attack. Then in the climax he intentionally enters into a fight with Bruce on Bruce's terms, pulling his punches the entire time to again try to talk him down when he could easily take him out at any moment. Then, discovering Bruce's plot in the end, he keeps it secret from the very people he's apparently a ""stooge"" of. So, he spends the entire story dealing with numerous far less than ideal situations trying to keep as many people alive and safe as possible. But it's a character assassination of Superman.  If you see DKR as a character assassination of Superman, it's only because you're trying to. Throughout, he's portrayed as the best of the League, as the only hero still trying to protect the world in this dark future."

He is a member of an advanced race of aliens. To Superman, humanity is a fragile species that has not yet evolved to shake off the bonds of interspecies hate and barbarity.

comicbooks,3dyif5,Slackware1180,10,Mon Jul 20 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"No offense to the author but this is a pretty poor article. A lot of the points don't even make sense. Mostly I think it fails in understanding Superman. It paints him as being so far above humanity that he views them as barbarians or something. But that's not Superman. He was raised as a human, he loves humanity, he considers Earth his home and considers himself a member of humanity. The idea that he would look down on humanity is a profound misunderstanding of him as a character.  The points about the Fortress of Solitude are a waste of time considering most of the time Superman isn't the one who builds it or he utilizes existing technology to construct it. He doesn't just picture it in his head and then do it. I'm also not sure what point they were making with the cave already being under the manor. Are we to infer that the author thinks Batman is too dumb to figure out how to hollow out a cave?  Ultimately I don't think anyone denies Superman's intelligence. He knows a lot because of his super powered advantage. But there's more to being smart than knowing a lot of stuff. Batman's strength is in application. He's clever. He can improvise. He has a tactical mind and is adept at analyzing a situation. That's what makes him so dangerous. It's not just sheer intellect."

Booster and Blue Beetle are always the same way and Guy Gardner was for a long time too until Johns' Green Lantern. I actually think it fits perfectly with the way the JLI series' were written in that they were far more comical than then other iterations of the league and a lot of the character interactions were due to their in-fighting and bickering. Therefore they aren't taken as a serious team and are self-conscious because of it.  That being said, this story takes place during what we would think of as the 70's team and before the JLI period, in which Ralph was a pretty new team member. In that way I also think this just shows that he didn't really know his place and had some confidence issues."

I mean, I acknowledge that he has amazing technical skill, and he's incredible at making very detailed portraits that almost look like photographs.  Buuut, I feel that part of the point of comic art is that it's not supposed to look like a photograph. It's intentionally more abstract. And this abstraction is not just because artists don't have the skill to draw realistically - it actually say something. It sets the tone, and it communicates feeling. I mean, this is not exactly ""photo-realistic"", but you definitely get the feeling this is a darker ""noir"" style story, just from the single frame - it communicates something extra by being a bit more abstracted. Even this more cartoonish style communicates a lot with its exaggerated racial expressions.  On top of that... I think you can communicate this kind of stuff in photo-realistic art - after all, that's what film and tv does - but Alex Ross's doesn't do that, and as a result, his brightly lit exquisitely detailed superheroes look like extremely good wax statues instead of real breathing people."

Kyle Rayner who put his spirit in a ring construct, Nightwing, and A magic Native American based on Apache Chief from SuperFriends use magic to bring the league back to life and the league ultimately discovers that although he's been in pieces all over the ocean floor for 2000 years, Plastic Man has been very much alive the entire time and is even shown dreaming about Batman playing Baseball.

He survives the whole ordeal, albeit with significant psychological issues. Joe Kelly's run is known for making the characters all pretty over-powered, but based on the way the character is written most of the time I don't think this is too far fetched.

comicbooks,3e1d0t,usefb,3,Tue Jul 21 05:10:20 2015 UTC,The main Secret Wars title is awesome but you should definitely read Avengers/New Avengers first if you're planning on doing so at all.  My top 5 is:   Korvac Saga M.O.D.O.K Assassin Master of Kung-Fu Old Man Logan Weirdworld   Also Silver Surfer is a fantastic series and the Last Days tie-in issues seem really important so far.
comicbooks,3e1d0t,CorruptedEvil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"I ended up getting    Secret Wars, Old Man Logan, Infinity Gauntlet,   Korvac Saga has me intrigued because I love Abnett (and Lanning) but I don't really know any of the characters there other than Major Victory. Is it similar to the DnA cosmic run?   Was looking at Civil War as well but I think I'll hold off on that for now cause hey there's plenty of stories with heroes beating each other up.   E for Extinction looks really cool but I never read the Morrison run so I think a lot of references would be lost on me."
comicbooks,3e1d0t,alianov,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:24 2015 UTC,"The Warzones and Last Days tie-ins don't require you to know anything about Secret Wars beyond the broad strokes, which are provided in the recap pages. I would read the Last Days tie-ins for any book you were already keeping up with.  So far, Infinity Gauntlet is really, really good. Master of Kung-Fu is a pretty fun Shang-Chi book that has martial-arts themed versions of a lot of Marvel characters. I would recommend 1602: Witch Hunter Angela to anyone who likes Gillen/Bennet's Angela, Stephanie Hans art (!!!), or Gaiman's 1602. Marvel Zombies by Si Spurrier is definitely a buy for anyone who loved Elsa Bloodstone in Nextwave.   As for the Battleworld books, those are helped by reading the main book. Jason Aaron's Thors is a cool detective book. Runaways is a Battleworld-themed spin on the original concept by Noelle Stevenson of Lumberjanes. SIEGE is a tragic last stand against the zombies and Ultrons of Battleworld starring Kieron Gillen's favorite characters.  I haven't picked up Old Man Logan, but I'm hearing good things about it - it seems more up Bendis' alley of gritty noir and it has great art. It'll definitely serve as a lead-in to Lemire's ANAD Marvel book.  Edit: You should also pick up Captain Britain & the Mighty Defenders if you like Al Ewing."

comicbooks,3e1d0t,Daiteach,2,Tue Jul 21 05:16:58 2015 UTC,"You might not understand every detail of Secret Wars without reading Avengers/New Avengers, but you should be able to understand most of the important stuff. There might a few things that aren't clear yet, but that's more because the series hasn't revealed everything than because Avengers/New Avengers is required reading. (Although those series are pretty good and worth reading on their own merits, and if you were willing to read 80 issues of comics to understand secret wars better, those are the ones to read.)  The main Secret Wars arc is very good, but all of the tie-ins I've read (mostly X-Stuff) have been at least pretty good. The ones that are tied to events from the past have more context if you're familiar with those events, but they're designed to still essentially make sense even if you haven't read those individual stories, and I think they succeed at that for the most part, although I can't un-read Days of Future Past to see if I still understand Years of Future Past without it. (E for Extinction is probably the one that relies most on being familiar with what it's riffing on.)"
comicbooks,3e1d0t,CorruptedEvil,2,Tue Jul 21 05:26:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is I started reading Hickman's run on Marvel Unlimited but honestly it's just so daunting. I don't have the time to go through all of it right now. I really want to be following along the secret wars stuff right now because it seems great. I just don't know if I'll be doing my self a disservice by jumping into the story immediately instead of being patient and going through the Avengers/NewAvengers stuff,"
comicbooks,3e1d0t,jordo37,2,Tue Jul 21 05:41:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think that the real drawback to reading Secret Wars first is less that Avengers/New Avengers is important for understanding it and more that Secret Wars gives away some of the plot points from New Avengers. Of course, the basic premise of Secret Wars gives away what's probably the biggest twist, so that's basically already a sunk thing.  If you want to be part of following Secret Wars, you can just jump into it. You might have to Google or ask about a few points, but Marvel is not designing their (literally) line-wide summer event as something that you need to have read multiple series over the course of over three years each in order to be able to comprehend at a basic level. Everything you need to know from A/NA is recapped in Secret Wars #1.  I do feel like, compared to most people, I tend to be more okay with just jumping into things and accepting that I might only have 95% of the potentially useful information, so maybe take what I say with a grain of salt, but I'm pretty sure Secret Wars is fine if you haven't read A/NA."

Also Scott Lang has some pretty solid development.  But, to me, the script left a lot to be desired, the comedy didn't land very often(especially with the supporting cast), Darren Cross wasn't very well developed, and overall, it was just kinda forgettable to me, sort of bland. I get why people would find more enjoyment out of it than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  That being said, I'm excited for the future of Ant Man in the MCU, seeing his personality/power set clash with some of the other characters."

I've recently come to the realization that I like Lumberjanes a lot more than all the Secret Wars comics I've been dropping money on.  No ragrets.  Edit: Plus, the cool thing about having friends who don't read comics is the fact that you have a plethora of unique stories to share from a medium that's become relatively exclusive compared to television, movies, and books.  People know some of the characters from Marvel and DC already, so it's fun to rant on about adventures they haven't been introduced to yet."

I can be a bit too talkative and overdo that part. But the point stands. I've even got lots of friends of mine who've never picked up a comic to read some of my favorites.

I feel that now more than ever is a perfect time to let those tastes show, because honestly ""nerd"" culture is pretty mainstream at this point. Also I know it's easy for an outsider to say ""who cares what anyone says"" but it's honestly the truth! Comics are for you, and the meaning you apply to them is what matters. Honestly as far as ""childish"" things go you could do much worse, and hey at least it isn't Candy Crush or something equally as devoid of meaning. Let people write comics off, but if even one page of some book touches you in a way that is meaningful then there is more worth than people can imagine. Just keep reading!

That's because you are a child. There is this theory in psychology which states that only children are afraid to be seen as childish. An adult knows that they are an adult & so has no fear of appearing childish. Only a child is afraid of looking like a child, because they mythologies the concept of maturity, without realizing it is a mirage.   So here it is in a nutshell: If you a jeopardizing a relationship with someone simply for enjoying a medium then they are not a person who should be in a relationship with.  So here you go, I'm going to give you some philosophy homework to do. Until the end of August, don't live for anyone else. If someone tries to pick on something you like, simply shrug your shoulders and say ""well that's certainly one opinion.""  Don't restrict your interests on the basis of others, if you want to sit and read a comic on the train, sit and read a comic on the train.

They have no room in their heads for discourse about their characters and they constantly push upon new readers in the wrong ways.

comicbooks,3dy1qh,oblivious247,5,Mon Jul 20 14:17:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on who you ask.   ""Comics"" can refer to the actual artform of storytelling with sequential images (and words.  Although you don't always need words, per se).   Or ""comics"" can mean singular issue comic books (or ""floppies"", as a lot of folks around here refer to them).    ""Graphic novel"" is another tricky term.   I personally don't like to call something a ""graphic novel"" unless it is a book that was initially released as a long-form, singular piece, like Asterios Polyp, or A Contract With God.   A lot of people will refer to any comic book (that is to say, a thicker book, with a spine, that you can keep on a bookshelf) as a ""graphic novel"" too, which is fine, but if you're slightly ocd/snobby about it, it's technically incorrect, as they're ""trades"".     In previous years (pre-2000s), trades were primarily paperback, with exceptions made for ""important"" books, like The Dark Knight Returns, Kingdom Come, and Marvel Masterworks and DC Archives collections.   But around the late 1990s/early 2000s, there was an uptick in ""decompressed"" storytelling that lent itself to the collected editions (trades), and a market really formed for such books in hardcover format."
comicbooks,3dy1qh,weirdmountain,6,Mon Jul 20 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember that the term ""Graphic Novel"" first gained notoriety as a means of showing that there was such a thing as ""mature"" comic books. It was a means of combating the decades long conception that comic books were for children, but ""Graphic Novels"" were okay to read because they were for adults.   It was basically a way for ""mature adults"" to admit to liking comic books that told really good stories without facing the (at the time) societal stigma associated with being an adult who enjoys comic books."

Usually adhere to a regular release schedule. Example: Teen Titans #3.    Trade Paperback (TPB)/Hardcover: Usually a collection of multiple floppies, often issues that combined tell a full story. Often referred to as ""Graphic Novels"", but not really the case. Kind of have a release schedule for being released X amount of time after the final issue in the trade has been published. Example: Teen Titans Vol. 2: The Culling    Graphic Novel: A full original story that is not a compilation of anything else (although some GNs may have some extra stuff included in them), usually the length of a few single issues, if not more. Can also be part of a story, but don't usually have any kind of release schedule. Example: Teen Titans: Earth One Vol. 1.    Graphic Novel: NOT a blanket term for every comic book, even though culture at large tends to misuse this because comics are becoming larger in mainstream culture again but ""comic books"" are silly and childish and undignified and not actually worthy of any kind of attention or recognition so they need to use a fancier-sounding term so their monocles don't fall into their tea out of embarrassment.

comicbooks,3dy1qh,thegraaayghost,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Originally, a graphic novel was a longer piece of work, with a beginning, middle, and end. Nowadays, people use it to refer to what I would call a trade: a collection of serialized issues.   To me, it sounds pretentious, or like the person is afraid to say they read comic books because those are for kids, after all.  ""I don't read comic books, I read (sip of champagne, puff on pipe) graphic novels.""  Now here are some quotes I'm taking from Wikipedia.  Alan Moore:   It's a marketing term... that I never had any sympathy with. The term 'comic' does just as well for me... The problem is that 'graphic novel' just came to mean 'expensive comic book' and so what you'd get is people like DC Comics or Marvel Comics—because 'graphic novels' were getting some attention, they'd stick six issues of whatever worthless piece of crap they happened to be publishing lately under a glossy cover and call it The She-Hulk Graphic Novel....   Daniel Raeburn:   I snicker at the neologism first for its insecure pretension—the literary equivalent of calling a garbage man a 'sanitation engineer'—and second because a 'graphic novel' is in fact the very thing it is ashamed to admit: a comic book, rather than a comic pamphlet or comic magazine.   Neil Gaiman:   ...all of a sudden I felt like someone who'd been informed that she wasn't actually a hooker; that in fact she was a lady of the evening.   Jeff Smith:   ...'graphic novel'... I don't like that name. It's trying too hard. It is a comic book. But there is a difference. And the difference is, a graphic novel is a novel in the sense that there is a beginning, a middle and an end."
comicbooks,3dy1qh,MetalOcelot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:16:18 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of definitions and distinctions but in general it's like this:  Comics - Can be individual issues (floppies) or graphic novels.  Graphic Novel - Can be either a paperback or hardcover collection of issues or a complete and original story only released in this format.   Original Graphic Novel - term used to describe a complete and original story released in graphic novel format (X-men God Loves, Man Kills, The Death of Captain Marvel)  Trades - a umbrella term used by comic fans for collected editions. Short for Trade paperback but I see people use it for hardcovers as well.   Omnibus/Omnibi - Hugh collections of like 50 issues in paperback.  There is quite a bit of overlap with a bunch of these terms."

comicbooks,3dy1qh,Lefthandedwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:48 2015 UTC,"I had a debate about this with a friend at my buddy's comic shop recently, and I think the answer basically has to do with the containment of the narrative.  Collected issues of Spiderman are not graphic novels because that is just a monthly issue condensed, and is liable to have its story contents change with the practices of the changing editors, writers or company properties.  However, something like Watchmen is a graphic novel because it has a narrative that is defined by the unique structural and stylistic elements in the book, which are rendered together to form a cohesive narrative.  However the 'Before Watchmen' series is not really a graphic novel, as it is more like a collection of stories from that universe (despite the idea that it actually contradicts ideas and events from the novel.)  Generally the conceit is that a graphic novel must have a particular way of using the medium like a novel, in that the story must have a kind of strict adherence to its own rules and structures.  It can have sequels, if need be, such as Maus II, which was really just a continuation of the story of Maus, but generally the sequel must apply to the same rules of structure and design indicated by the first."

Pope is all angular and squished, trying to be ugly. It's great, but it's the furthest thing from beautiful.    Although this demonstrates why I sometimes hate this board, you know how people will post a random panel from a book and go ""Look at derpy Batman!"" completely ignoring the context of the panel, or how it fit into a larger sequence? You could do that with almost any given panel of Pope's Batman stuff. Now, it's a crap post, made by someone who started reading comics last week, but that's my whole point.   Staples, on the other hand, draws a pretty mass-market acceptable Batman. Well, Future Batman, anyway. Like, nothing ""stylized"" about that at all.

Battling Boy was written for a young adult audience who aren't necessarily comic book fans, and I hear it sold pretty well. Honestly, Pope was one of the first artists who I really fell in love with. The fact that Pope's style fuses American and Japanese comics art is probably a plus for many people, and not a minus.   And if we're going to talk about artwork being kinetic, I think Pope's art style might actually be more accessible for some people. Look at how he depicts movement in Batman 100.

comicbooks,3dwxok,StoneGoldX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:32 2015 UTC,"Both, in a way.  I don't think Batman: Year 100 is good for new readers content wise, and stylistically, I think Pope is an acquired taste broadly speaking. I think there are plenty of other interesting Batman books you can get someone hooked on that aren't Year 100 and that aren't Year One or TDKR. Personally I didn't love Year 100.  As for the Dark Phoenix Saga, it's a big culmination of things that had been going on with Jean Grey and the X-Men and to just drop a new reader into the middle of something that huge and maybe even a little confusing/convoluted probably isn't the best idea. I'm not a huge X-Men guy but surely there's a better key story that could hook a new reader."

I hate this elitist attitude a lot of LCS have, I'm glad mine isn't like that.  The New 52, for all the crap it gets, isn't a bad place to start for new readers. My dad really likes the CW shows as well and I've gotten him Green Arrow vol 4 and The Flash vol 1, he really enjoyed both. If you like Batman, his New 52 stuff has been quite good as well. Volumes 1-3 of Green Arrow are skippable, they weren't very good.  Marvel Unlimited is also a very good investment for new readers as well, you might want to look into that too if you're into any Marvel characters.  Edit: I should add, Image is also a very popular company on this sub. Most of the books they're putting out are excellent and they sell things DRM-free straight off their site so give them a look as well."

comicbooks,3e13ta,hufnagel0,3,Tue Jul 21 04:59:24 2015 UTC,"Well, they're not doing their jobs then. Check out Green Arrow: Year One by Andy Diggle. It's a modern origin story that tells of Oliver being stranded on the island, and it has some loose influences on the TV show.    Generally, with comics, you don't need to start from the very beginning, and read everything in chronological order. Instead, you'll want to follow certain writers on the series that you're interested in. For example, Mike Grell was a prolific Green Arrow writer in the late 80s. One book you might want to try out is Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters. Another would be Kevin Smith's Green Arrow: Quiver. Something much more recent would be Jeff Lemire's run, which starts with Green Arrow, Vol. 4: The Kill Machine. Note that even though it's the 4th volume in the series, you don't need to read anything prior, as Lemire doesn't continue from any prior story, and instead gives the reader a fresh start."

Sadly they can totally ruin getting into comics for folks, either by being elitist or sexist or whatever.    Me? I got into this stuff through TV. Grew up on all of the DC cartoons. Batman Beyond, Static Shock, Justice League, I loved all of it.    For me, a great entry point into the world of comics was by checking out Silver Age material (stuff from the 60s and 70s). It's not the best or smartest, but it's weird and wild and a fun way to kind of ease in to it all. I liked Batman, so I picked up a collection of old Batman team-ups, and it introduced me to a lot of characters. I liked the Teen Titans cartoon, so I got an old Teen Titans collection and had a blast. It's a good entry point because it has nothing to do with the modern books and their heavier continuity, and kind of lets you ease into the comic book world at your own pace."

As far as starting from The Beginning; it's close to impossible to do, and even if it was plausible, Silver Age Green Arrow wouldn't act that much like a modern GA would.  A few other folks suggested The Kill Machine, and I'd agree. It might feel weird to start at what says volume 4, but trust us; Jeff Lemire wrote it so that people who know NOTHING about the character could hop in at that point."

comicbooks,3dveyt,vadergeek,5,Mon Jul 20 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"Which is kind of a cop-out, since the Maquis of Death was throwing around Beyonders levels of power, and the ""apprentice"" (Doom in disguise) had to had some fraction of that power.  Getting brain damaged by the Hulk is as stupid as normal powered Thanos knocking down Galactus, if Doom was really the ""infinitely superior being now"" that he claimed.   Maybe that whole storyline was more smoke and mirrors and empty bravado than anything else.  Now that I remember there was a ret-con to the story in Dark Avengers #176-177. Doom was saved by the Thunderbolts and was able to travel to the future with them. So his claim of surviving for millions of years as... what, ""hate consciousness""?... is invalid, though he certainly would of had to do something to his body to deceive the Maquis so. Unless the Maquis is just a complete idiot? Or went along with it because he wanted Doom to destroy him?  I don't know; now this is all making my head hurt."

comicbooks,3dveyt,vadergeek,3,Mon Jul 20 03:09:41 2015 UTC,"True.  So with the Dark Avengers ret-com and the Hulk setting back the status quo, what does that really leave us with?  Doom trained under the Maquis 20 years ago and acknowledges as ""Master"" (which that itself is a huge change to who Doctor Doom is... that he needed to be taught and bows to anyone; not the Doom I know) was confronted in the present and beaten and sent back to the past, was saved by the Thunderbolts and returned to present, somehow found and deceived the Maquis (magic maybe? Maquis didn't really show to have magical abilities, more Omega level times a billion level mutant), bided his time, waited for the Maquis to be weakened by the augmented FF and Clyde (just conveniently the same reality FF as himself, but it's comics, so can forgive that one) and gave the killing blow.  Then he exaggerates about surviving being eaten alive, living for millions of years, and being ""superior"" and the FF ""now beneath him."" Does a little teleportation trick, next gets confronted by the Hulk, and loses whatever he picked up being side by side with the Maquis.  I think that works.

And also important to note that this Kickstarter was for a printed version of an already completed digital comic, so it's not like he needed months to write and draw it.    There's really no valid excuse for taking this long on either of these things."

This dude seems to have gotten a near 50k investment and still doesn't see himself as a professional comics creator in that he doesn't worry himself with deadlines or things like PR.
comicbooks,3dtwf9,foxdye22,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:05 2015 UTC,Unless it involves sketch covers for eBay to pay for incendentals or paid speaking engagements. Then he's friggin' Tony Robbins.
comicbooks,3dtwf9,rxsheepxr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:47 2015 UTC,"On top of that, though, if you make plans for a stretch goal (which I did many times with my projects) just do them, get them out of the way, even if you're not certain that goal will be reached. Then you don't have to play catch-up. In the meantime, he very well could have had that 4-page epilogue completed well before the whole debacle, and is saving the ""need to draw it"" and ""the emotional toll it's taking"" as a couple more bullets in his sympathy card ammunition.  The whole thing just reeks of fans getting played for fools because half of them are sympathetic to his story and give him all the leeway he wants from them, but the ratio is shrinking, and more of them are finally realizing that, hey, bad shit happens to everyone and we still have a job to do. Imagine if I tried to use even half of the excuses he's given to get out of my job... I'd be long fired by now. Enough is enough.  The most telling part, to me, is that he's not arguing about all these points that people bring up. He's ignoring them, blocking them, deleting them. If he just honestly answered the accusations instead of finding yet more excuses, perhaps people would chill out on it. The fact is that people are owed things and he still has time to make money for himself on the backs of people who are seemingly willing to wait multiple years for results. If he came out and said, ""I screwed up, I've mistreated you guys and I'm very sorry,"" then set a solid date and ACTUALLY followed through, maybe, MAYBE then he can restore some of the goodwill that he's robbed from people."

I was a backer of this project and even messaged Dean back in August last year to find out what was happening with the project as I had been touring the country for a few months and didn't have much access to the Internet. It was a really long, thought out message and what I got back was a short blunt response saying he had been super busy but would have them out within the week. It came across quite defensive when I felt as if I had been nothing but encouraging and supportive. Like a lot of Dean's backers I supported this project because I related to his experience.  Even though I only pledged at the 15 dollar level, I had to pledge an extra 15 dollars to get the book shipped to Australia. I'm not going to lie, I feel pretty ripped off and I'm really glad someone else has said something and that I'm not the only person feeling this way."

Dean blocked people who tweeted out the article.  [1] A bunch of commissions went out, but a lot didn't almost two years later. I received one of two. He posted the sketch I received days after I ordered it, but took almost six months to ship it out. The other one is MIA and he doesn't respond to people asking about them any more."

After two and a half years, I finally got the commission he owed me a few months back. I emailed him to let him know it was received, and in response, Dean asked if I could scan it so he could color it and make prints for conventions.  This dude made me wait 2.5 years, wouldn't respond to messages, came up with every excuse in the book as to why he couldn't get his promised work done, but he'll still ask you for a favor. GREAT guy.

Dean brought their ire upon himself by assuming that ""the internet"" would allow him to just screw people over without repercussions.  Edit: how is this downvote-worthy? Honestly?

comicbooks,3dtwf9,rxsheepxr,26,Mon Jul 20 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"Just kinda reading through the whole saga here, and it really seems like if he would just take the time to finish the commissions and do the work instead of writing long diatribes about his excuse du jour, he might actually be able to catch up with his obligations.  Saying that hearing people's stories messes with him to the point where he can't do the work (again, despite being able to draw new things to sell on eBay for himself) is absolute hogwash.  I also saw him get crappy with a ""fellow victim"" and shamed him for using against him... words like ""I can't believe a fellow victim would treat me like this;"" but Dean, dude, you're doing the exact same thing by using that excuse every time your fans try to get information out of you about the things you OWE them. If you can't keep up, get the hell out of the industry. You can't have it both ways.  And then you get a guy like me who's run two successful Kickstarters and delivered on both, MONTHS early by myself because I actually appreciate the support. Granted, they're much smaller in scale, but cripes, Dean, the comic was already completed. A year and a half past expected delivery time and you couldn't be bothered to simply get them printed?! Seriously? I LOSE money for each copy I have to make and then have to find creative ways to make even a little back, and yet I was STILL doing it because I'm over the moon that even five people want to own my work, let alone $50'000 worth.  This just drives me up the wall.  Edit: Seriously, though, the comic was completely created BEFORE the campaign was started. How emotionally taxing is it to send a file to a printer and get it done? Is it more taxing than travelling around the country and talking to people about his story? I highly doubt it, but he's making it out to be.  You know what, dude, we all have stories. We all had bad things happen. Don't shirk on commitments. You can't mine your own history to make a product you intend to sell, and then use that same story to excuse yourself for what is, in no uncertain terms, stealing money from people who admired you.  ""What I spend the money on is not your business.""  That's a quote from him.  Uh, it is, though, when the money was given to you to PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT WAS PROMISED nearly two years ago, and you admittedly use it for personal travel to ""spread the word"" about how brave you are.  Seriously, man, you're one of the worst.  Edit #2: He's been posting new digital work on his Facebook while really talking up how great Manga Studio is. I wouldn't be shocked if they're sponsored updates, but at the same time, if you have time to screw around making new prints to sell for yourself, YOU HAVE TIME TO FULFILL YOUR COMMITMENTS."

My art style doesn't lend itself to anything that would take many hours to do, anyway.  Ultimately, if you can't deliver, don't take people's money and don't take on more than you can handle. It's all about honesty and knowing your limitations, knowing what's expected of you, and making a plan that will allow everyone to come away from the situation happy.

comicbooks,3dtwf9,so_frunk,4,Sun Jul 19 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"I had a Kickstarter at the same time he had his. Mine was successful, but nowhere near the degree that his was. He made at least(my math is horrible) 15 times as much as mine did.  But the thing about Kickstarter is that there are a lot of people that are horrible at math on there. It's one thing to get something fully funded, it's another to factor in the costs for rewards and whatever else you promised to do. And it's my experience that with printing costs factored in for a book, it becomes difficult.  That's why it pays to be honest with people while you do this. Tell them that there were costs you didn't factor into this. If you get them the main thing they asked for, for the most part, they're pretty happy. Especially if the thing in question is absolutely beaming with quality.  That's where Trippe has stumbled. His Kickstarter's promo was beautiful and I was pretty jealous looking at it. I was like 'This dude is gonna make it'. You all know his was one of the featured Kickstarters on the front page.  If there were costs he didn't factor into it, he should tell people. He shouldn't hide behind his past. Someone in the comments below said that his behavior is why some folks don't donate to Kickstarter, and they're absolutely right. Because when you destroy trust with the folks interested in you, you make it harder for the rest of us with the same aspirations as you.  I will also state that from beginning to end, Kickstarter is stressful. From watching it get funded to actually getting it done. No one is prepared for that. It's the main reason why I would likely NEVER do another one. I'd rather do it myself.  And as shitty as this entire thing is, at least he's not this guy.   http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140305/wicker-park/kickstarter-fail-artist-raises-51k-publish-books-burns-them-alley"

The problem is that it always seems to be hysterical idiots leading the charge which predisposes me to side against them. My gut reaction is not ""Oh, he seems reasonably angry,"" it's ""Oh look, another complainer has another problem on the internet and they're trying to rally the troops to assuage their sense of failure.""

If you are concerned about water damage put the comic box inside a plastic garbage bag and keep them off the floor. You might also keep the comic box inside the plastic storage bin. However if you are that worried about water damage, don't buy any comics until you have a dry place to keep them."

So it’s important to me that that be true to who I was in this moment. And if there’s too much compromise, it really wasn’t going to be an Ava DuVernay film.   Makes sense. This is pretty much what everyone assumes went down with Edgar Wright as well. Making a movie for a studio like Marvel is always going to involve some amount of compromising your vision to fit their end-game. Sometimes that works for the artist (James Gunn seemed to flourish), sometimes it doesn't.  I will however say that that this statement:   t one point, the answer was yes because I thought there was value in putting that kind of imagery into the culture in a worldwide, huge way, in a certain way: excitement, action, fun, all those things, and yet still be focused on a black man as a hero — that would be pretty revolutionary. These Marvel films go everywhere from Shanghai to Uganda, and nothing that I probably will make will reach that many people, so I found value in that.    Is interesting to me, and something that I had never really considered before in the question of why directors known for the small personal films would even think about attaching themselves to a huge franchise film (Rian Johnson on Star Wars, for example). The idea that movies like the ones Marvel makes would allow these directors to share some part of their vision and message with a global audience that they would otherwise never be able to reach on that scale is a pretty interesting one."

I just have a difficult time seeing Scott Free in what amounts to armor when as an escape artist he'd need to maximize flexibility and mobility.  I mean it looks cool, it just feels strange to me."
comicbooks,3dtgh8,Crash_Recovery,18,Sun Jul 19 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that the design is cool, but it misses the point of who Mr. Miracle is. My biggest issue is that it removes most of the Kirby influence and that just bums me out. If it was recolored, tweeked a little and goggles were added you would have a good Dr. Mid-Nite redesign."

I mean he's lived his whole life getting out of imprisonment. It's a core personality trait. It'd be like a Batman whose parents weren't murdered or a Superman who still lived on Krypton.  It's a part of who he is, not a career choice.  Additionally his name is ""Scot(t) Free"" it's an in-joke to his escapist nature.  If you remove the ""escape artist"" of Mister Miracle you're left with a generic New Gods character who'd have faded into obscurity."

So far his new suit has saved him like a dozen times just by preventing some degree of harmful radiation from entering his body/preventing solar energy from being drained out/taking hits from him whenever he gets depowered/helping to stabilized other people's wounds by putting the armor on them.

comicbooks,3dyd7v,BloodMageApostate,4,Mon Jul 20 15:20:18 2015 UTC,"For The Flash, first off, you have to know that there have been four people that have taken on the mantle as The Flash. They are Jay Garrick (40s-50s), Barry Allen (50s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 50s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  You could read Wally's solo run before you get to Flash: Rebirth if you want. Rebirth is one of the last stories you'll see Wally West as The Flash.  I hope this helps! Have fun reading!"

comicbooks,3dyd7v,hufnagel0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"My biggest piece of advice to anybody looking to hop into superhero comics: just know that EVERYBODY was confused as hell when we first started. Unless you start from old Golden Age stories, almost everything will have some reference to something that came before.   So the issue number isn't as important as which issue is the beginning of a story arc (or a writer's/artist's run). Any suggested reading lists or wikis will tell you where stories start; you just gotta determine what interests you the most. And luckily, it's easier these days for casual fans to find paperback collections of certain stories than it ever has been.   For example, I'd suggest reading Frank Miller's (guy who wrote Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, Sin City, 300) Daredevil run if you're digging that character. It starts with an arc called Born Again. I couldn't tell you what issue that is (Wikipedia knows, I'm sure), but I can tell you Amazon has a great deal on it...  http://www.amazon.com/Daredevil-Born-Again-Frank-Miller/dp/0785134816"

I dont remember at what point in the Shadows long history it was revealed that he is really Kent who has taken over Lamont's life, but I want to say it is pretty early on and I cant remember if/when Margo learns of it.

Funnily enough, the Shadow didn't ask for permission, he just took over and Cranston had to deal with it.  In THE SHADOW UNMASKS novel, the Shadow reveals to Dr Tam that he is actually an aviator named Kent Allard and for a while Allard is used in the stories. This is canon, but to be honest, I still have doubts. The Shadow is so secretive that I thought it was weird he just revealed the Kent Allard background so freely. I think Allard was just another fake identity but that's just a fan theory.  Margot Lane was brought into the pulps after becoming popular on radio and I think Agnes Moorehead did Margot's voice on the air.. so that's Endora from BEWITCHED helping the Shadow solve gruesome murders!"

comicbooks,3du9er,maybe_I_am_a_bot,10,Sun Jul 19 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think its not that he's a moderate liberal, but more that he is incredibly deontological in his thinking. For those who don't know what that means, deontological ethical thinking is based upon acts, while its ""opposite"", consequentialism/utilitarianism, is based upon consequences. This is shown really well in Hickmann's New Avengers, with most people being okay with doing what they do, because the consequences are good. Blowing up a planet is sort of okay when the consequence is saving the universe. For a Deontological thinker like cap, killing someone who does not deserve to die is never okay, no matter how good the consequences. (For example, you could argue that cap killed Nazi's not just to win the war, but also because, them being Nazi's they deserved to die. Stark would kill Nazi's because it was the most efficient way to quickly win the war.)  Given this, 616 Cap is indeed very left wing, but with a big focus on personal freedom as well. He is somewhat anti-authoritarian, and left-wing on social issues. However, his deontological thinking means that he'll be more ""I treat everyone equally"" then ""We should force people to treat everyone equally"".   If you look back at the civil war, you can see this personal freedom/deontology part being very important again. Cap is not necessarily against people getting trained to be a superhero, its the forcing people to do so that he's against.  Looking at the authoritarianism stuff, I think one of the most interesting things about cap is that, when he's not careful, he has a tendency to too quickly follow orders without thinking, given that he does not immediately have objections. This is especially visible in movie cap (with Steve joining shield without actually thinking about what that means, and deciding to go against authority only when it does something really wrong.). But traces of it can be found in some stories."

comicbooks,3du9er,maybe_I_am_a_bot,6,Sun Jul 19 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"He's... strange. At the start, he's pretty much written as a character that is from the 40's, A generally good guy from the 40's, but very much someone from that time. He seems to see children and women as being weaker, responding to this by putting them out of harms way, think 1940's benevolent sexism (he goes and beats up Hank Pym, unasked, when Hank beats his wife with bug-spray (its a weird story)). However, maybe due to the fact that there is little on him, there doesn't seem to be any really strong storylines featuring his personality beyond being a man from the 1940's who believes in America. Him being the president is about him saving America through force of arms. Its hard to say where he stands on moral decisions because there aren't that many he makes that truly stand out the way that 616 cap has. There is the way he handled the mutant situation in the ultimate universe by dumping them in the middle of a semi-radioactive desert, but that's presented as being outside forces. (Although this does show that he is, at the very least, not as strongly deontological as 616 cap, who would've simply said screw you and have done what he thought was right. This is what that famous speech is about.)  tl;dr: Not much information to go on, 1610 is for the 1940's a good guy, but not someone who is very strongly on the deontological side of things in the way 616 cap is."

comicbooks,3du9er,woodaba2,14,Sun Jul 19 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"With the exception of Humphries' run, The Ultimates has been consistently better than the Avengers ever since it started.   Fight me."
comicbooks,3du9er,ChickenInASuit,9,Sun Jul 19 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"Millars run on The Ultimates is a lot of fun but about as deep as a puddle, with some great character moments (I enjoyed the whole thing with not knowing whether Thor was the real thing or not) but it's overall pretty brainless. Also, ""Do you think this letter stands for 'France'?!"" CRINGE.  Jeph Loeb's Ultimates is one of the worst things ever to happen to comics and makes Humphries look like Alan Moore in comparison.  Hickman's run was incredible... until he left early and gave the unfinished scripts to Humphries, who proceeded to balls it all up with a bunch of crap about talking tumors, and then started his own run, which everyone's already covered.  Fialkov's run was alright.  Meanwhile, Avengers went through an uneven, over-stretched period being written by Brian Michael Bendis which still gave us stuff like Dark Reign, Dark Avengers and a few others, and then Hickman took over and is in the middle of wrapping up one of the best runs The Avengers have ever had.  Fight me."
comicbooks,3du9er,woodaba2,4,Sun Jul 19 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get crap for this, BUT...the longer Secret Wars goes on, the less love I have for the Avengers run. When I was in the thick of it, and had no idea where it was going, I was loving every minute, but Secret Wars is halfway through and, if it stays as it is now, it basically renders most of Hickvengers pointless. It all depends on how the beyonders are handled. If they really have been killed of panel...then I'll be very, very disappointed.   Ultimates 3 is awful. Awful, awful, awful. Worst comic ever. But Loeb's New Ultimates is...not great either. It's ok. The art is cool.   As far as Millar's run goes, I definitely think it's better than Bendis avengers. I never really liked most of it. Dark Avengers was pretty cool though. I prefer Millar's Ultimates. I'm no fan of Millar, in fact, I hate almost everything else he's ever done, but I really like his work on the Ultimates. It's tied with his Authority for my favourite Millar comic (Red Son doesn't count because I'm convinced that 90% of the good stuff in that book didn't come from him). I think it's smarter than perhaps people give it credit for, particularly Ultimates 2.   Shall it be fisticuffs, or pistols at dawn?"
comicbooks,3du9er,ChickenInASuit,0,Mon Jul 20 00:31:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you on Secret Wars but I can see where you're coming from with everything else. I don't know, I loved Millar's Ultimates when I first read it, but I reread it recently and I don't think it holds up very well. I can appreciate it for how influential it is and it's certainly not boring, but I think it's big and loud and dumb and while that doesn't necessarily make it a bad comic, I think Hickvengers is on an entirely different level of storytelling.  As a side note, have you read Millar's run on Swamp Thing? I'm not generally a fan of his either (I'd rank Nemesis up with Ultimates 3 among my least favourite comics ever, and Wanted and the Kick Ass series were pretty horrid too) but his Swampy is actually pretty good.   EDIT: Oh, and pistols? Psht. Bring your finest blade, nancy boy, we're gonna do this like men."
comicbooks,3du9er,totallyarogue,4,Mon Jul 20 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"Hahah, okay. I'll warn you that I couldn't make it through Volume 3 and pages like President Captain America make me not even want to BOTHER. It's been years since I read vols 1 & 2.  While I appreciate the comparison between 1610's Cap being the 'conservative' Cap and 616's Cap being 'liberal,' Millar's Steve Rogers utterly and absolutely misses the point of Captain America as a character. For example: when he uses the French as a punchline just as an attempt to be badass. It's yet another example of Millar's work being gritty and edgy for the sake of being gritty and edgy.   The only time I sympathized with 1610's Captain America was when he couldn't figure out why the Wasp was just weirdly OKAY with the Maximoff twins' incest. The fact that I have to write that sentence demonstrates quite a bit about the title."
comicbooks,3du9er,woodaba2,8,Sun Jul 19 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"You're only talking about Ultimate Cap here. I'm talking about all of Ultimates as a whole. I'm honestly the same, Ultimate Cap is, in most stories, the weakest part of The Ultimates."
comicbooks,3du9er,totallyarogue,3,Sun Jul 19 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right: I really like Cap and he's a pretty integral part of many Avengers-esque teams, so having him be shitty makes a big difference in my enjoyment of a title.   Keep in mind these are just my opinions (subjective) and as I said, I didn't read far since it turned me off so hard.  I think a lot of the choices of characterization were off-putting. I have no problem with heroes not necessarily acting like heroes (especially in early/origin stories), but there was some stuff Ultimates chose to do that really turned me off.  Doubling down on the Pyms' domestic problems is one thing, doing that by Hank go SUPER spousal abuse was gross, IMO.  As I mentioned, Janet's out-of-nowhere being okay with the twins' incest was...odd.  There's some homophobia that is once again done for a punchline (""HULK STRAIGHT!"") that I'm not really comfortable with.  There were a couple of things I really did enjoy about the first volumes - Loki is just Neil Gaiman, we weren't sure if Donald Blake was just insane or actually Thor, Nick Fury being Sam L. Jackson.  Thinking about it, everything I enjoyed was stylistic and not actually plot or characterization."
comicbooks,3du9er,woodaba2,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"From what you've said, I don't think you're the kind of person who'd enjoy The Ultimates. Fair enough. Different strokes for different folks. I will say that I don't think you're being entirely fair, and you're writing off some brilliant stories.  One last thing, I would hardly say that Hulk acting the way he does is homophobic. That's a very shallow interpretation that takes everything a character says as writer gospel. It's more likely a mockery of that kind of OTT masculinity.   I mean, it's not like no one says the Hulk is a character we should emulate, right?"
comicbooks,3du9er,totallyarogue,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"That's entirely possible! It might not be my style of story, but I hate to write anything off that somebody's willing to defend without at least re-investigating it (and with Marvel Unlimited, why not?).   Would you mind getting into why you think the stories are brilliant, and if you think there's any arcs specifically worth checking out? Thanks!"
comicbooks,3du9er,woodaba2,4,Sun Jul 19 21:18:17 2015 UTC,"The reason why I like Ultimates is the same reason why I like Ultimate Marvel more so than Mainsteam Marvel: thing change. I used to be a big fan of marvel, and I especially loved Grant Morrison's New X-Men. It's still my favourite comic series ever. It ended with an exceptionally bold move at the time, a story where a much-beloved supporting character turned out to be Magneto in disguise, a much more vengeful and violent magneto after his dreams literally went up in ash with Genosha, finally snapping, conquering New York City, destroying the X-Mansion, and killing Jean Grey, before being killed himself.  Them Marvel retconned it all away, swept it all under the rug, in a horribly hand fisted way.  Ultimate Marvel doesn't do that. When people die, most of the time, they're dead. When things change, they change for good. It doesn't see characters as museum pieces, but as people, people who change and grow. Without the confines of having to remain marketable forever, Ultimate Marvel could do things that regular marvel couldn't.   What if Peter Parker died and was replaced by someone else?  What if Mutants became even more hated than they already are, and set up warring city states to survive?  What if Reed Richards turned evil?  Ultimates is the same. It doesn't see it's characters as idols to be respected. It takes familiar icons and takes new spins on them, and sometimes they work, like with Wasp, Thor, Hawkeye, and Iron Man, and sometimes they don't, like with Cap. But at least they are different. And at least they do change.   It's also essentially a spiritual successor to The Authority, a team that was all about exploring slightly darker versions of superheroes in a world not unlike our own and gigantic scale battles that really show off the scale of superhero battles.   That standout arc of the entire series is the opening arc of Ultimate Comics Ultimates, essentially the Ultimate post-Death of Spider Man, Jonathan Hickman's brief run on the series. For about nine issues, we basically have the perfect comic. Unfortunately, tragically, Hickman had to leave to work on his Avengers saga and it was left in...less capable hands. It has absolutely zero Ultimate Cap, if that helps you.   I also really like Ultimates 2. It sounds like you've read at least a bit of it, but I urge you to give it another shot. The first half of it is almost a satire of the first volume, with each character really examined in great detail, how they think, and why they are the way they are. It's also a damning indictement on American interventionism as well, whether the author intended it or not. And then the second half fulfills everything the Ultimates ever wanted to be with the most thrilling blockbuster comic experience I've ever read. Grand Theft America is the best Avengers movie you've never seen. It has this weird thing where it starts off really making these characters seem totally awful before turning around and demonstrating why they're still The Ultimates. I think it really works. It answers the question of whether Thor is actually the God of Thunder or just a crazy person as well, which you were down on.  If you like Hickman's run, I'd also recommend Fialkov's Ultimates Dissasembled. It's really, really silly, but it revels in it's complete over the top insanity, and I really like the artwork.   Also check out Ultimate Thor, it's a four issue mini series by Hickman about the origin of Ultimate Thor, and it's great too. It's tragic that Hickman clearly had big plans for Ultimate Marvel, but couldn't do them.   You'll want to avoid Ultimates 3 and Sam Humphries run. Humphries run is dumb and boring, Ultimates 3 is the worst comic I have ever read. It's just a spectacular failure on a technical level of simply making a comic.   Based on what you have said, I'm still not sure you'll like a lot of Ultimates. But if you're gonna try any, try Hickman's run. It really is something special. Just be prepared to be disappointed by the ending.  sigh What could have been, what could have been..."
comicbooks,3du9er,Amy_of_Dallas,5,Sun Jul 19 21:51:23 2015 UTC,Ultimates 1 & 2 were pretty fun. Everyone and there grandmother agrees that Ultimates 3 is the worlds most tremendous shit taco.   This run wasn't very good IMO as well. This panel demonstrates that.

The movie stuff was hilarious, and Gwen's death sincerely caught me off guard and shocked me, which is saying a lot considering I knew she had to die at some point.  Venom by Rick Remender vol. 2: still enjoying this series a lot. This volume (the Spider-Verse tie-in) was fun, but didn't feel very important in the big picture of the story.  I've gotten a library card and borrowed the first volumes of several image/vertigo comics to get a feel for them. So far I've finished...  Y: The Last Man vol. 1: This was too good for words. There's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, but this is the most compelling book I've read. I've since picked up the first hardcover, and I can't wait to dig in!  East of West vol. 1: This was great as well. The beginnings are intentionally unclear, so I'm really interested to see the world and characters fleshed out.  Ex Machina vol. 1: I really enjoyed this, despite disliking almost everything about it. The art process is interesting, but the final product strikes me as posed and lifeless.

I'm trying to read as much as I can before Monday since during the work week I don't have  spare time for reading. Since it's hard to go anywhere on comic forums without reading Y spoilers I kind of already know a lot of stuff that happens but I'm still enjoying the hell out of this.
comicbooks,3dv22n,REACH_ME_DAT_MILK,5,Sun Jul 19 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"It Was the War of the Trenches I finished this this week. Possibly the greatest Tardi work I have read so far, but also the hardest to read, hence the break I took halfway through. When I say hard to read...I have been somewhat critical of Tardi's writing in the Manchette books - it's so cold and detached. Then I read The Arctic Marauder and saw that it was more due to Manchette's writing style than Tardi, since that book has much livelier writing. This is hard to read just because it shows the senseless horror of war so well that you don't want to endure it for too long. It's not a chore to read though. Tardi puts you in the boots of the individuals whose stories he relates in this series of short tales so vividly that you are practically there in the trenches. It's a very lonely, scary, and completely senseless (it really deserves to repeat that word) thing, this war. I think it was particularly bad in WWI. You don't get the sense of purpose or comradery that is common to see in WWII movies. Everyone seems acutely aware that this war is dumb and they don't want to be fighting it. You'll never want to sign up for the military if you read this.   Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths Like Tardi, Mizuki paints a picture of the intense horrors of war on a very personal level. Not only does he focus on a group of enlisted men and NCO's, but he actually participated in the tale he tells here. The story is of a Japanese battalion who ultimately make a suicide charge (actually, they make more than one, but only the last is ""successful""). It starts out with the men in their encampment before the war starts. Things already suck, due to food being in short supply, hard labor, and officers slapping and beating the shit out of you for any reason. By the time I got to the point where fighting is taking place, I was already wondering how the Japanese mounted this war with such incompetent people running the show. To be fair, it seems only the lower ranking officers don't know what they are doing and perhaps the higher ups were smarter, and also this is only one group of soldiers. Things only get worse once the fighting starts, though. No attack seems to go well (and again, a caveat could be that they are seemingly vastly outgunned). The enlisted men start out relatively normal - they joke and seem good-natured, but complain about their job and circumstances like anyone would. As people begin dying in battle (some men die beforehand from random, odd scenarios. One guy dies while fishing with grenades - he is collecting the unconscious fish and sticks one in his mouth where it gets stuck and he chokes to death. I'm assuming this is actually happened since Mizuki states 90% of the events are true), the men gradually begin to feel more hopeless, afraid, and angry about having to fight a stupid war that they never wanted and had no stake in. Things become increasingly bleak as the end nears.  This is by no means something you're going to feel good after reading, but it is a masterful anti-war treatise. The art here is really good. The figure work is cartoony, but the rest of the rendering is much more realistic  Promethee #1 This series by French artist Christophe Bec is one of the books Delcourt recently made available in English digitally. I know Bec as a very good artist, so I decided to check this one out. It begins promisingly, with some Peruvian Conquistador types exploring some jungle in search of gold when they stumble across an alien spaceship Ok, that's interesting and I'd like to know what's going on there. So, of course the next page we are suddenly in the near future and begin getting snapshots of different characters and places where not much happens beyond setup of a plot that never becomes clear and introduction of characters who there are too many of to spend enough time with to form a connection. And the whole thing ends on a cliffhanger that really isn't much of anything. To be fair, as bad as I'm making this sound it really could all amount to poor pacing. It is written well otherwise and looks beautiful throughout. I'll give it at least one more issue to see where things are going, but the preview for the Charlie Adlard book at the end has more of a hook in just a few pages.  Redhand Kurt Busiek joins what seems to be an increasing number of American creators, including Geoff Johns, putting out work through Humanoids now. Along with artist Mario Alberti, Busiek crafts a story which is very similar to the basic plot of Autumnlands, but with enough important differences to keep it from being too redundant. It's the first volume of what purports to be a series of OGNs in the Band Dessinee format, but it is a complete story arc that could be enjoyed on its own.   Black River I guess I'm reading a lot of ultra bleak shit this week. Black River by Josh Simmons is the graphic novel equivalent of a Cormac McCarthy novel. It's relentlessly and punishingly dispiriting. It's almost oppressively depressing. Don't expect anything nice or good to ever happen and if it seems like it might, something even worse is coming. Again, I don't want to sound like I'm trying to put anyone off reading this. It was completely enthralling to read. I couldn't put it down. Very deserving of all the best of lists it is getting put on.  Justice League: Gods & Monsters I read all of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman this week. I remember Batman, I kinda remember some of what happened in Superman, and don't really recall Wonder Woman. I liked all of them well enough, though. They were good, light entertainment to read after all the depressing shit to cleanse the pallet. All were written by J.M. DeMatteis. His Batman as a vampire story was interesting and I would read more of it. The voice he was using here sounded exactly like how he wrote I,Vampire back in the day. It's a brooding, slightly overdramatic introspective narration that reminds me of the soap opera-ish nature of Dark Shadows, but in a good way.  The art teams on all these books were outstanding, but I remember liking Moritat best. If I remember, I think he was the one that went between two different styles to denote changes in time period or something. If you've ever seen his work you know he's great and he doesn't half ass it here.  The Milkman Murders Joe Casey and Steve Parkhouse created this insane murder tale for Dark Horse and it is like Ladykiller with the craziness cranked past the red zone.  Tiger Lung Simon Roy's prehistoric fantasy tales of Tiger Lung are very nice to look at. I'm a huge fan of his artwork. However, they were not on a level with his short tales in Jan's Atomic Heart. It felt like we were getting morsels from a larger narrative. Like if you read three Tales of the Fear Agent, but there was never a Fear Agent series. Still, this book was really cheap and a Simon Roy fan will likely enjoy it.  Five Ghosts Vol. 1 Chris Mooneyham is a fantastic artist. He perfectly captures that pulpy look this book needed. He's kind of like a Gene Colan mixed with a bit of Robert Hack (is it Richard Hack? Fuck, idk). Unfortunately, the story here is a bit less than what I was hoping for. I believe that after this it may get better, since it graduated to an ongoing and there is more room to write a story and I think that's what held things back. Nonetheless, Mooneyham's work elevates things to the point where this is still worth a strong recommendation. If you look at some of the pages and enjoy what you see, don't hesitate to pick it up.  Secret Wars #3-4 I knew this would happen. I wanted to wait until the series was through to read it all, but I couldn't do it. So now I'm stuck like everyone else, desperate to see what happens next, but forced to wait.   Crossed +100 #6 Oh Jesus Christ. I mean...I knew things weren't going to end well, didn't I? I was aware I was reading a Crossed comic, right? Not only that,  but I saw all the same foreboding signs Future Taylor saw. Yet, Moore managed to lure me into the same false sense of relative security that Future and everyone else was in. Sure, this future world isn't great, but things are mostly under control. The Crossed are dying out and the remnants are being mopped by teams. Or so we all thought. As devastating as the events of this issue are, it is still more about the emotions and the implications of all that occurs that disturb and horrifying and there is very little of the Crossed style of ultraviolence. Anyone who thinks that is all Crossed is should read this. I'm staying on board for Spurrier's continuation of this, but I hope Moore returns.  8house Arclight #1 I loved Marian Churchland's artwork. I've never seen her stuff before, I don't think, but I'm an instant fan. A graceful, almost P. Craig Russell-ish line (but not quite as almost too perfect as his is), incredibly imaginative landscapes that aren't overly detailed but clearly show you the world, and lush color (I'm horrible at telling what kind of medium color is done in. Is this oil?). Just beautiful. Graham's story is almost equally intriguing, but I was surprised at the seemingly leisurely pace set here. Since I know these 8house books will feature revolving creators, each telling a chapter of their own story, I was expecting them each to be short series. Not that this is a complaint, what I got here was great stuff."

Kirby's New Gods, the Anti-Monitor, the Justice League, let's have them fight. It's like something you'd come up with as a kid playing with action figures. Yet...it's working. So far it's playing out really damn good. Fabok is the secret weapon here for sure. If it wasn't for him making everything look as awesome as it should, I think the story would fall apart. This is the first thing I've liked by Johns (I've never read his Flash or Lantern runs). For me, that says a lot.   Island #1 All I've read of this so far is Kelly Sue's essay on smoking, betting on horses, and her friend Mary. It was very well-written and interesting. I've looked through all the art and it all looks great.  Fear Agent Ive reread almost the whole first half of this. It's everything I love.  The Invisibles Deluxe Vol. 1 I'm about 6 issues deep. Not as crazy or hard to follow as it's reputation. Yet.   Secret Agent X-9 I started reading this comic strip by Alex Raymond and Dashiell Hammett on one of those sites online that has old comic strips, but - as is quite often the case - the quality is not great and it is unclear whether or not they have the whole thing or if it is all in order or what. Not only that, but it is so good already that it is definitely worth owning. So I'm gonna have to get the recently released collection.

comicbooks,3dv22n,LeafyGent,4,Mon Jul 20 14:36:11 2015 UTC,"Island was easily the best thing I picked up last week.  It really feels like a magazine of comics made by artists rather than writers, with Emma Rios, Brandon Graham and Ludroe each bringing their extremely distinct styles and voices. More of Graham's Multiple Warheads is always a joy, Rios is always incredible and it's interesting to see her produce a solo sci-fi comic (in red ink, which looks fantastic with her line), and Ludroe's style in his skater-superhero story is like a fusion of urban graffiti with punchy Kirby-esque perspective. It's all top notch stuff.  For the price of two 20 page Marvel comics I got three 20-30 page comics, a magazine article, several art pages from the wonderful Marion Churchland and a brief two page strip by Brandon Graham talking about his creative process. It's probably the best value buy in monthly American comics.  I'm already excited to see what comes next month."

The future of this book seems real strong. My only disappointment was that it wasn't traditional magazine size (like Creepy, Eerie, Heavy Metal, Savage Sword  etc). After all this time of being billed as a magazine it is more tpb size. Slightly bigger than that but closer to it than magazine size."

It's really just a rehashing of TLH, but you can't go wrong with all the great villains that Batman has in one story. I actually think the Hangman killer as a concept is more effective and daunting than Holiday was, but it wasn't as powerful since it was pretty much the same idea as Holiday. I also really liked Two-Face in this book, especially the scenes where he's in a courtroom. Finally, I didn't like the big reveal of Hangman's identity. I thought it was a little forced and wasn't all that impactful. With all that being said, Tim Sale nailed it again and this book looks great. Dark Victory is definitely worth a read, especially if you loved The Long Halloween like I did."

comicbooks,3dv22n,frankgogol,2,Sun Jul 19 22:57:38 2015 UTC,"Only MU this week    FF (2012) - 1-16 (Whole Run)  This book is everything I want, a dose of wierdness, some Scott Lang, a gallon of humor, a pinch of reality; stir it around and you get Fraction's FF not to mention the Allred family's art.   Fantastic Four (2012) - 1-16 (Full Run)  Space. History. An appearance by everyone's favorite obscure character. And multiverse shenanigans. What is not to love about Fraction and Bagley's Fantastic Four; besides the tie-in issue to AoU.   Ant-Man (2015) - 1  Re-read this issue, to get my Scott Lang fix. One of my favorite Ant-Man issues, Nick Spencer does a great job with humor and action. My only complaint would be the art, I read #2 and on, and I feels it picks up, didn't satisfy me this issue.   The Mighty Thor (2014) - 14 - 17  The only thing I liked about this arc was the enchantress side arc for the first and second issue, after that everyone felt to me it dragged on. The last two issues' art was phenomenal, props to Larraz.   Superior Spider-Man (2013) - 1 - 4  Incredible premise, and great writing, Slott at his best. The art swings from great to meh constantly, but Slott's writing is right on the mark. I dislike Slott's current Spider-Man series, but this is pretty good.   Fantastic Four vol.1 - 570 - 574  My introduction to Hickman's F4; weird, confusing, original, and fun. Nothing more needs to describe this arc, except that though it is confusing at first, it explained very well. The covers are meh, and the art irritates the heck out of me. Great scenery artist, terrible person artist, especially the final issue.   Starting Doom Patrol tomorrow, fingers crossed."
comicbooks,3dv22n,Zerujin,2,Sun Jul 19 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Catching up with the X-Men   **Storm #1-4   Story: Warren Ellis - Art: Terry Dodson - Ink: Karl Story - Color: Rosas / Lenshoek  Storm goes back to the Morlock tunnels, feeling guilty for having to kill Marrow (to stop an insane bomb plot), and performs a ritual of light in mourning.  When she does this, Mikhail Rasputin somehow knows and pulls her into his alternate dimension where more of this tedious morlock vying for the top job plays out between Storm, Callisto, and Mikhail Rasputin.  Yes, again only this time there's a bit of an Apocalypse vibe to it.  Storm is a very shallow character housed in a very ornate character design and nowhere is this clearer than any time she's given solo focus.  The ONLY story they ever give her is ""Well, I guess she can go back and fight Callisto for leadership of the Morlocks again,"" as if Storm is so involved with being a leader that she can't function without having something to lead (which, by the way would be a REALLY interesting thing to explore and only really got much play way way back in Uncanny #280something when she broke up with Forge). There are interesting things happening around that nonsense, though.  Cable is involved for some reason as the outside perspective character.  Mostly that falls flat, he doesn't know her really at all, robbing his observations of any real perspective, though he does manage to get off a really clever and insightful line ""Time travel seems to involve a lot more going back than it does going forward,"" which he applies to Storm going back to the Morlock tunnels in the first place, but it classic Cable fashion, the insight is wrapped in a package of silly genre nonsense.  Recent   Tales of Honor #1   Writer: Matt Hawkins - Art: Linda Sejic  It’s a James Bond type story featuring Catpain Honor on a mission to track down her uncle who’d gone missing while investigating a human trafficking ring.  Like IXth Generation (also by Hawkins), this book feels like it’s part of a much larger franchise.  It’s a fair book.  It doesn’t knock me out, but it’s clear and well realized with clear expressive art in a space travel universe.  A solid B+ book and would have a spot on my pulls if I was more into serious sci fi and\or crime stories that can get out of hand.  Probably the standout revelation on this is Linda Sejic.  Her style is very much like her husband’s which for me is a bonus.  It’s got a real effortless, clean, expressive look to it.   13 Coins   Story: Martin Brennan and Michael B. Jackson - Art: Simon Bisley - Colors: Ryan Brown  This is like a checklist for every juvenile male fantasy - child of destiny main character, fridged girlfriend, all authority figures are caricatures of corruption, hypocrisy, and evil, angels and demons are good and evil with no more depth than that, female characters are voiced just like the men, everyone is always itching to fight over nothing, blah blah blah.  The art is inconsistent, at times brilliant and at times misshapen and clumsy (not for effect, just off model).  I’ve got a suspicion that when the art shines best it’s on account of the colorist more than the pencils, with really painterly gradients.  Apart from some few moments of brilliant coloring, though, this might be the worst thing I've read all year.   Wolf Moon   Writer: Cullen Bunn - Art: Jeremy Haun - Color: Lee Laughridge  It’s the story of a man who hunts werewolves.  It’s not particularly good or bad, but it doesn’t really do anything that stood out, challenged the genre, or was amazingly well executed.  All I can say is that it’s perhaps not ambitious enough to make a strong impression. Kind of a bland affair all around.   D4VE   Story: Ryan Ferrier - Art: Valentin Ramon  I expected different.  I expected a story of crushing mundanity presented in an absurd way through the perspective of a robot.  The book starts enough like that, but veers off into save-the-day type antics that sorta cheapens it a bit.  I was hoping to see a story about coping with a failure to achieve greatness and moderated ambitions.  Ironically, the book took the easy way out and instead had the protagonist be a hero and save the day from an alien invasion, which resolves all his personal problems as well.   Spider-Gwen #1-5   Writer: Jason Latour - Artist: Robbi Rodriguez - Colors: Rico Renzi  Wow!  Holy crap this is really good! So, a lot of capes really bore me.  They’ve been around so long that they run into a few problems usually stemming from having to unjump a shark or put some genie or other back in a bottle.  Spider-Gwen manages to get the best of both worlds, the familiar and the fresh.  It clears out the clutter and allows us to explore core Spider-Man themes with new eyes.  The alternate universe thing frequently works.  Star Trek has it’s Mirror Mirror episodes, X-Men have their Age of Apocalypse world.  Spider-Gwen does that as well, placing familiar characters in new context, often to awesome effect.  #5 has Felicia Hardy as a Francophone thief\Lady Gaga superstar - in a word, awesome (also, Bryan Hill and Matt Hawkins, hell and Jeph Loeb, too: THIS is how you put a foreign language in your book!  You use the actual language the character would speak, Loeb, not just one that's kinda geographically nearby, and you talk to someone who has ever spoken French, Hill and Hawkins.)  While I would have been happy for just about any of the Edge of Spider-Verse books to get picked up for a series, one that strongly features vibrant colors and a chick rock band (seriously, between this, Jem and the Holograms, and now Black Canary, I’m loving it).  Speaking of colors, the art in this book knocks me out over and over between the city lights bokeh, and the general energy of it all.  I absolutely love this book.  Bummer that it looks like it’s on hiatus until October or later…  Much as I love the character, it's really the world that's amazing - the recontextualizing of familiar characters and situations that draws me in. I’m not sure I’m interested in her interacting with the broader, crowded, janky Marvel universe.   Curb Stomp   Writer: Ryan Ferrier - Art: Devaki Neogi - Colors: Neil Lalonde  The best thing that can be said about this is that Tula Lotay did the cover for the first issue (and good god damn, it's beautiful).  Otherwise, it's a convoluted mess of a bland gang war story without any hook to really draw interest.  People die or get kidnapped or whatever, but without knowing the character well or why they mattered to anyone, it all fell flat.  At one point a character is murdered and I thought was watching her mourn her own death only to find out that it was another character whose design is just similar.  It's diffuse and dull with way too much time spent trying to explain away why the police don't do anything.  The art is rough and janky.  It's really not very good as a whole.   Catwoman #39-41 & Convergence #1, 2   Writer: Genevieve Valentine - Art: Garry Brown, David Messina (41) - Colors: Lee Loughridge  Convergence: Writer: Justin Gray - Art: Ron Randall - Color: Dave Eltaeb  What attracted me to this series was the complex intrigue going on.  Selina Kyle: Mob Boss versus Black Mask: Also Mob Boss was really interesting.  Moreover, it was its own thing.  There were references to events in other books and some events and characters were informed by outside books, but none of it was essential to the story that was going on. This stretch largely undoes all of that.  It works to divest itself of the complexity and intrigue and independence and falls back on being a lame costumed adventure book that only serves as an appendix to Batman.  Selina Kyle as the head of a mob family trying to wrestle control away from the established crime families and rival aspirant mobster Black Mask is really interesting, and any time she puts on the damned costume it's a defeat, not just for the character, but for what the creative team is trying to do with the book.  Besides that, there already is another costumed Catwoman, and if they want to explore that costume in the context of this political story, they have someone to do it with and it would actually be interesting.  When Selina puts on the costume, it's as out of place as Tony Soprano putting on a cape and tights.  I want to take a minute and talk about the art in the book.  For much of the run, it's been a serious obstacle.  The book has been relying on political maneuvering, intrigue, espionage, and so on.  As appropriate it is to the shady, morally ambiguous mood, the sketchy, heavily inked style (not to mention much of the character design) has made it very hard to decipher which middle-aged mid-Atlantic looking white guy in a suit is in which room, who is alligned where, and who knows what.  Ward?  Mason?  Nick?  I think there's an Alex?  There's even a scene with Bruce Wayne in it and until someone called him by name I thought he was just another crony.  While David Messina's art isn't extraordinary, he does at least bother to draw these characters as different people.  The Convergence tie-in is forgettable and barely worth mentioning.   Imperium #1-5   Writer: Joshua Dysart - Artist: Dough Braithwaite - Colors: Brian Reger with Ulises Arreola  Not much in the Valiant universe does much for me, but I do like Toyo Harada.  He's got a sort of Magneto or Dr. Doom grandiose battling for the future thing going on.  Sort of an aloof embattled visionary thing.  I like a good story of a tyrant.  I mean, it's Valiant, so it takes itself way too seriously, is blindingly focused on the white male perspective, cavalierly kills characters before we know their names (like is it a running joke that HARD CORPS guys are just super-powered red shirts?), but this one at least isn't boring, though it could do with some better cover design..."
comicbooks,3dv22n,HGFantomas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS & MONSTERS  Justice League: Gods & Monsters - Batman DeMatteis and Timm do a great job at establishing the mood of the comic. It is a dark and bloody horror comic. The art is great as well. Overall, the ending felt a tiny bit rushed.  Justice League: Gods & Monsters - Superman Unlike Batman or Wonder Woman's prequels, this is a full origin story. The best of the three prequels, in my opinion, mainly because of the emotional narrative told from the perspective of Superman's sister. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been as effective. This is dark Superman done right as I still root for the guy.  Justice League: Gods & Monsters - Wonder Woman The story starts with Wonder Woman being dropped to Earth in early 1960s via a Boom Tube. Not much is explained about her origin, the New Gods stuff. Still sets up a great motivation for Wonder Woman, setting out on her quest for peace.  Justice League: Gods & Monsters (Comic) Upon reading this, I realized that the WW title also served as a set-up for the story here. I liked what they were going for with the Forever People but then Dr. Psycho turns into the big bad, meh. Overall, not as good as the solo series.  Justice League: Gods & Monsters (Movie) I just finished this so I don't have a full opinion yet. From the beginning, it gets even more visceral than the comics. Wonder Woman got more sexy in animation. Michael C. Hall was great as Batman's voice. Really liked all the easter eggs and cameos; Ray Palmer, Victor Fries, Will Magnus and the Metal Men, Cyborg, President Waller and many others. Only thing I didn't like was Darkseid's voice.     Action Comics Issues 36-42 Greg Pak continues his great character work, not only for Superman but also for the supporting characters, and Aaron Kuder continues to nail the art. Business as usual. This is the main Superman title for me. Even the ""superstar"" writer and artist on the series titles Superman looks like shit in comparison.  Batman/Superman Issues 12-20, Annual 02 The second arc was a mess, mainly because of the art, and then it got caught up in crossover hell during Doomed. Since then, it has been great. Since it is written by Pak, I still very much feel that this is a Superman book with Batman as a supporting character, which I am perfectly fine with.  Batman: The Dark Knight Returns I loved it. However, I don't think this is ""the most to be the definitive Batman story"", ""the definitive Batman"" or ""the greatest comic books of all time"". Unlike some people, I don't have a problem with the characterizations of Batman and Superman, because guess what, it is an elseworld comic, not set in continuity. These are not ""your"" Batman and Superman. The characters are just means to tell a story. I do feel that some parts were unnecessary (Did he really needed a new Robin?). A tiny bit dated art wise but the writing still is good as ever. Also, I feel like I would have enjoyed it much more if I hadn't watched the animated movie years ago, since the movie was a very faithful adaptation.  Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again I became interested in TDKSA after hearing Morrison's perspective. That or I was expecting a ""so bad, it's good"" book but either way, I got ""so bad, it's just bad"". It's specially bad as a follow up to TDKR. I did laugh for a good while at that Wonder Woman.  Batman Odyssey I only read it because of this article. Although after reading, the book isn't as hilarious as the article makes it out to be. For example, the part where the Joker leaves Batman speechless after making him realize that he wasted all his time and energy chasing clowns or Alfred ""I don't give a hydroelectric dam"" Pennyworth are just Deadman in possession of their bodies. The best part about was how the first half ended on a ""cliffhanger"". Ra's al Ghul is explaining the main villain's plan to Batman, how everybody involved is in grave danger, and Bruce says something like, ""I'll take care of the impending doom, but first a quick nap"" and proceeds to sleep on the floor of the Batcave with everyone just standing around him going ""is he serious?"". The book lost in the second half.   Criminal Vol. 1-2 The first volume read like a B-movie and I didn't get the hype about the series. But after reading the second volume and thinking more about both, I realized that although the stories themselves are cliches, the writing, specially in terms of the character motivation, is solid. The art complements the gritty nature of the stories. Maybe I will like the series more as a whole in retrospect after finishing the rest of the volumes.  Superman/Wonder Woman Issues 13-17 I will be dropping this title. I just don't see a reason for this to exist.    SUPERMAN: TRUTH - Action Comics #41 - Batman/Superman #21 - Superman/Wonder Woman #18 - Superman #41 - Action Comics #42 - Batman/Superman #22 - Superman/Wonder Woman #19 Catching up on what has been released so far. I am liking this much more than Doomed. Almost all the books involved serve a purpose (even S-WW, which I now think shouldn't even exist in the first place). Action Comics is the main story, while the Superman title serves as a prequel. Batman/Superman is about solving the mystery while also about crossing over with the new Batman. Superman/Wonder Woman involves Smallville and Lana Lang, who I like that Pak has kept around as a recurring character."

Each volume stands on its own competently at the very least, but the real charm of the book comes from the way threads are introduced and picked up later with such mastery. It feels like B & S are telling the story at hand, the story of The City, and fleshing out details in a handful of familiar and new tales in every single issue. It's just stunning how rich a world that created in six volumes considering the economy of the storytelling and art.   tl;dr Criminal is great and you'll only appreciate it more as you go further."

Even when some if the stories slouched a little, the characters pulled me back in.  Grayson #1-4: Alright, I like Grayson. The first time I read these I wasn't too much of a fan, but this time through it was pretty awesome. Issue 3 was definitely the best. I also already picked up the rest of the series, I have yet to read it.  Identity Crisis #1-3: This is also really cool. I like the characters a lot, and the mystery is compelling."

He almost doesn't even need marketing, and they still dropped a piece of shit that half the people didn't like.  Marvel Studios need only to announce they're doing a movie and people get excited.

comicbooks,3dzi2j,jackfreeman,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Much like DC superheroes, many people feel removed from the movies. They feel detached and separate. My wife knows about comics through me, but isn't a reader. She loves the MCU because she feels like she's part of something unfolding.  These are not fanboyistic comments and downvoting won't change that. DC fans don't get it. Screaming about how great these characters are and can be won't change that.  Batman Vs Superman is kinda a huge cinematic event. It's a huge tentpole, marquee seller...but I'd wager more people are psyched about Civil War because they feel more invested."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,0,Mon Jul 20 22:26:50 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that Marvel's missteps have been quiet and easily forgiven. DC's have been loud and ugly, and since their volume of movies has been so low, they haven't been able to balm the burn with anything but Batman, and even those aren't clean wins.   Viewers, by now, understand that Marvel movies are going to be more consistent and more coherent, and that it's going to be more of a struggle to enjoy DC movies, IMHO."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,jackfreeman,0,Mon Jul 20 22:43:06 2015 UTC,"but thats only a specific case, overall marvel has put out mediocre movies, but by the time the reviewers realize it the hype train for the next movie has already begun. what i mean is that dc has more to lose by putting out a bad movie since they dont pump out as many as marvel"
comicbooks,3dzi2j,pineapplemikel,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"All I've gotten from all this discussion on various threads and articles is that Marvel fans need their hands held more than DC fans.  And I'm really trying not to sound mean or whatever, but the DC hate has gotten to me."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,DarkKnight37,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"The issue is that you consider it DC hate. You consider any dissatisfaction with DC to be hate. Hence DC fanboyism. I don't give a fuck who hates Marvel because I like their movies and that's all I need to be concerned with. I don't come out of a movie really feeling the need to argue or convince anyone who feels otherwise if I like it.  You rabidly defend Man of Steel, why? So, you like it. Why do you care if I think it's a piece of shit? You know how much I care about your bias against Marvel? Zero. Diss it all you want. Have toilet paper with Marvel Studios logo on it for all I care.  Neither Marvel nor DC are paying me, so I have loyalty to whoever puts out the most shit I like. Right now, that's Marvel. It has been DC in the past.  I've seen Marvel fanboyism too, and that's as bad, but you need to stop insisting dissatisfaction is hate. Like, your name is ""DarkKnight37"". You're biased."

Secondly, you can dislike Man of Steel all you want to, that's your prerogative.  I think we're doomed to disagree about movies...I saw in another of your threads that you like all the Marvel movies but Iron Man 3.  I think Iron Man 3 may be my favorite of the Marvel Studios movies.  Thirdly, I don't think dissatisfaction is hate.  Green Lantern is definitely not my favorite movie ever.  Granted, I like it more than most people, but that's really not saying much.  Still, I don't have WB because I think there are many things that could've been improved upon in GL.  Finally, I want both of the Big 2 to succeed, in movies and comics.  What's good for one company is good for the business, which is good for the other company.  I just feel like the hate scales tip way more toward DC than Marvel."

You can't admit bias then have an unbiased discussion. Nothing against you, but I literally cannot trust your words because of that."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,3,Tue Jul 21 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"What all this boils down to for me are the characters. I can't watch a movie, no matter how good the script or story, if I don't care about the characters. That's my main problem with the MCU; I just don't like any of the characters.   The Netflix series are a different story. Daredevil is excellent and I can't wait for the Punisher and Iron Fist. Wolverine is my second favorite comic book character and I love the X-Men movies (except for the third one and most of Origins). I would almost kill for a really good Ghost Rider movie.  All this to say that I don't hate Marvel. I just hate everyone crapping all over BvS and Suicide Squad when those movies don't come out until next year."

Because if your issue is defending things from criticism until we literally have seen them, you'd do it for all of them. I somehow doubt you've done this.  I've ripped what I've seen of the FF movie because it looks fucking terrible. It most likely will be, but I could be wrong. Same for BvS and SS.  I'm an atheist. I don't believe there's a god. All evidence suggests there isn't one. I could be wrong, but that little bit of microscopic possibility isn't enough to make me be neutral. Same with these movies."

I found ant man to drag on a bit much on the origin part, action was a bit lagging and supporting cast was ehh. Movie was good, not great. I'll give DC a shot, but I'm really hesitant on suicide squad.   My issue with marvel is that all these movies are building up to the infinity war and I'm supposed to believe that these characters are gonna take down thanos when he gets the gems? While the movies are enjoyable their end game is going to be a little hard to swallow. If DC sticks to their universe and doesn't pander to the masses they will lose though as outsiders who aren't familiar with some of the characters will be turned off.   GotG was a gamble for marvel and it was their best movie, because it didn't have to try. Here's our team you like it or you don't. I guess DC will try that formula. Hopefully they're successful because good comic movies from both universes is a good thing for fans."

And here's the rub, Warner Brothers isn't going to take a ""met too"" approach to their films when Marvel is already 11 movies deep into a shared film continuity.  At the end of the day, these companies want to make money, and there's little doubt that BVS will make money.  I don't want DC movies to ape Marvel movies. Hell, I don't want Marvel movies to ape Marvel movies, but for the most part, they've developed a house style.  I respect the fact that Warner Brothers is taking risks with some unconventional approaches and directors with unique visions.  I'd rather see something risky and ambitious that flops than something very safe that plays to the fanbase and is mediocre.  At the end of the day, I think I'm just aging out of super hero comics in general and super hero films specifically. Maybe I'm the wrong guy to ask."

Downvoting won't alter that their bs excuses of Disney having more money won't change the fact that they've spent less on each movie except two, than DC has on one. Two if you include BvS and SS (Considering the cast).  I don't care whose movies rock or whose suck, but facts are facts. It's not a fact which movie is good or bad, that's opinion. It's fact this isn't about Disney money. Disney may have more money, but they spend less per film because Marvel Studios do more than WB, with smaller budget. So, it's irrelevant.  I see downvotes in this situation as confirmation."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,0,Mon Jul 20 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"Well put. However, if you want to really see the downvotes fly, say something about how black characters are treated like garbage alongside black creative teams, and you're in for a treat."

comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,3,Mon Jul 20 20:18:49 2015 UTC,Why do you think the MCU is a success?
comicbooks,3dzi2j,ddownie56,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"Because it's handled with care and respect.  Iron Man was an unknown character, with an unproven director and an actor who had never recovered from a terrible grace-fall in the eyes of everyone. Many didn't even know who he was. It cost 140 mill, way less than Man of Steel, and it was intended to kick off an MCU. We never knew how much was riding on Iron Man, but it worked. Fan acclaim, critical acclaim. One of the highest rated superhero movies on websites.  It worked because they give a shit. You think those who made Man of Steel love Superman? No. Favreau and RDJ and everyone else either had or developed a LOVE for this character.  Even the Nolan movies, though great as movies (Ledger deserves every bit of the acclaim he got), weren't great superhero movies. They were amazing crime movies with Batman in. Warner just do not know how to handle their shit. They're almost ashamed of their properties, it seems. They tried their hand at light-heartedness and we got Green Lantern.  Nobody making these movies seems to love what they have in their hands. I cried when I read All-Star Superman. I was giddy the first time I read TDKR. Flash of Two Worlds is STILL something I re-read. Wonder Woman means more to me than most human people.  ...it's not about fanboyism. It's about care. Until Warner start caring, why should I? The only DC comic I read is Batman now because the characters I do love aren't being handled as I'd like. Snyder's Batman is what happens when you love something.  Warner don't get that. Marvel Studios do. Yet, this comment will get downvotes because people simply don't like a bad word said of DC, which is why they're enablers who will continue funding Warner's shit."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,5,Mon Jul 20 22:50:03 2015 UTC,"This company war bullshit is really stupid. You're painting Marvel Studios as if they're artists masterfully creating love letters to the characters while Warner Bros. are evil money grubbers.Just because they make creative decisions you don't agree with doesn't mean they don't care about the character.   Marvel Studios has put out some real stinkers too you know. In my opinion the Thor movies, the Iron Man sequels and Avengers 2 were far worse than Man of steel.   The only DC comic I read is Batman   Then you're missing out on some seriously great comics.   Grayson, Omega Men, Prez, Gotham by Midnight, Martian Manhunter, Black Canary, Green Arrow, Action Comics, Justice League United, Robin:Son of Batman, Midnighter, Justice League 3001, Starfire, Catwoman, Section 8, and Justice League are all excellent in my opinion."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,ddownie56,0,Mon Jul 20 23:08:45 2015 UTC,"No company war. It's a one Vs other discussion and one simply appeals to me more. If DC drop a movie better than anything Marvel Studios have done, I'll be there admitting it. I WANT Wonder Woman to slay, so we get a great movie. I don't want this to fail. I just am not blind.  I have no interest in currently debating what movies are better than which, it's not what I'm discussing here.  As for the comics, I did have about 10 DC on my pull post-N52 for about two years. They mostly got shit, so I ditched them."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,2,Mon Jul 20 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"You're saying it's not a company war but you just literally typed several paragraphs about why Marvel Studios is better than Warner Bros.    You're saying you don't care about which movie is better but earlier you said..   The Avengers was one and Age of Ultron was the other. Marvel Studios churned out a Netflix series and an eight episode mini series with a female lead that has received way greater acclaim than the reboot of Superman. Ant-Man, regardless of your opinion of the film, is garnering greater acclaimed than Man of Steel. Let's examine that. ANT-MAN IS RECEIVING BETTER ACCLAIM FROM FANS AND CRITICS THAN THE FIRST SUPERHERO AND CULTURAL ICON THAT IS SUPERMAN.    It sounds like you really care.   They mostly got shit, so I ditched them.   You should consider picking some up because several of them really are great."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,ddownie56,0,Mon Jul 20 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"That chunk of text about Ant-Man was me showing that an unknown character to the general public is doing better commercially and critically than a DC character more well-known than arguably anyone besides Jesus Christ.  It's not about which I like more, it's about why the above has happened, which is to say people trust MS more than WB...because MS have handled their MCU with planning and intent for 10 years. DC/WB have not.  Nobody had really heard of Ant-Man or Guardians, but they knew it was MCU so they checked in. Everyone knows Superman but nobody gives a shit because we've all seen Superman and his big screen outings, aside Donner's Superman, leave lots to be desired.  Same with Spidey, actually. We've all seen it. Until a great Spidey movie happens, many won't give a shit."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:10 2015 UTC,Ant-Man is not doing better commercially. It opened with 56 million while Man of Steel opened with 128 million. Guardians of the Galaxy opened with 94 million.  So I don't really understand your point.
comicbooks,3dzi2j,ddownie56,0,Tue Jul 21 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"Used the wrong term, sorry. What I mean is, people like it way more than Man of Steel.  Man of Steel had way more money behind it and way more marketing. Ant-Man is beating it out where it counts. Why? Because MS have built trust."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,theforceds,-11,Tue Jul 21 02:13:31 2015 UTC,"Found an article that sums up my POV.   I am a Marvel comic book guy, but loved the Dark Knight Trilogy. It's, IMO, the best trilogy ever, and The Dark Knight is the best movie ever.   But. As the article states, it doesn't mean as much when things are shown via flashback as opposed to 2 hour movies. We don't know this Joker, ""Oh cool, his teeth are metal because Batman knocked them out!"", that should've been an Act 3 thing.   As should've Robin dying. Shit, they could've shown Batman in MoS at least.   But, they're so far behind that they feel like they need to create an Avengers movie first. And that's nonsense. Not to mention having a semi-retired Batman that we don't know, at the start of the Universe...   Boo."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,Zeno84,16,Mon Jul 20 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"This is such utter and complete nonsense. Plenty of excellent movies start in the middle of the action without explaining everything with a dumb fucking origin story.  We didn't get the origin story to John McClain for Die Hard, or the origin story of Sarah Connor in Terminator.  They've been doing this dumb fucking comic book movie formula of A->B narrative for so long, that people think it's mandatory. It's not, it never has been.  Frankly, if we get another Spider-man origin in 2017, I think we'll all lose our minds."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,Megazell,5,Mon Jul 20 20:18:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. Blade was already a known threat to vamps in his series. It was not his first day or Rookie Year. He was a legend already among his adversaries. It's fiction they can do what they want with the narrative.
comicbooks,3dzi2j,Zeno84,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"The terminator is her origin story. What you're saying is we didn't see her birth. Or childhood. But we saw how she went from A to B as it applied to the story. Same with McClain. We didn't start at Die Hard With a Vengeance, him fighting a brother of someone he killed but we didn't see.   Your analogies are wrong.   And im not even talking an origin. But they're skipping super vital moments that make the characters who they are. And I don't think anyone can argue that having a movie where Robin dies at the end would be better than a flashback. We don't need another Uncle Ben, but we've never seen Robin die. Or even a recent GOOD Robin. But we're supposed to just input all of this backstory so we understand where Batman is coming from?   It screams ""catch up mode"" and robs the audience of what SHOULDVE been amazing. It still can be, sure, but it's not the same and that's really not up for debate."
comicbooks,3dzi2j,kinghammer1,9,Mon Jul 20 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"It is the same though. Part of this Batman's origin story is the death of Robin, much like the death of his parents. It shaped him. It shaped who he is. We don't actually NEED to see it even if it would have been amazing.  Sorry if I flew off the handle on you, but just because Batman had amazing adventures before BvS, it doesn't mean we need to see them all.  Hell, the entire superhero comic book enterprise is based on the notion that you almost certainly will not start from the beginning."

This movie, if it's to resonate like the Avengers did. Relies on general moviegoers, and they don't know that.   Outside of that, you could argue anything up to today is anyone's origin. Gwen Stacy dying, etc. but like you said, it'd be amazing to see.   And, no apologies necessary dude. I get like that also. I just disagree with the notion of:    just because Batman had amazing adventures before BvS, it doesn't mean we need to see them all.    There is really zero reason they needed to skip that. And, it sucks that they did. Bith as a comic book fan and knowimg that the general public will essentially react the same."

comicbooks,3dukhp,HouseOfH,3,Sun Jul 19 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"Ennis has a definitive run on the Punisher, but he usually doesn't do superheroes. His take on them in his comic ""The Boys"" is excellent and his take on the entire superhero genre and he comic book industry with his own usual craziness of violence and sex and deprived imagery.   Superman and the Punisher are the exception to his usual dislike of superheroes.  The issue in Hitman you speak of is wonderful.   Preacher, Punisher and Hitman are amazing. Please tell me you've read Preacher as well!"

I will read it though, I like Ennis as a writer too much to pass up on what is supposed to be his best work."
comicbooks,3dukhp,TriscuitCracker,3,Sun Jul 19 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"I can respect that. If you feel you can judge it on its own terms then have at it. Actually, it may even speak to you more because of your beliefs, if you read it I'd be interested in your opinion, even if you hate it.  And if you do, lol that's perfectly okay obviously.  It really is a great book though.  Preacher is like an epic Clint Eastwood/John Wayne Western movie, a journey across America, the wonderful and terrible power of a good friendship, all wrapped up in an orgy of violence and occasional depravity.  The central question being ""If He exists, why does God allow bad things to happen?""  The book will be like ""I can't believe I just read that"" one second and then emotionally heartfelt the next. It has two great villains and the main trio of characters are so well developed.   The books start off with the main character Jesse Custer is a young preacher with a past who has suddenly (and violently) gained the ability of the Word of God. Basically, if he tells you to jump, you are compelled to jump, and never stop. He and his best friend Cassidy and girlfriend-turned-hitman Tulip O'Hare start a journey across America to literally find God and use his power to ask Him why are things they way they are in the world today.  Along the way, hilarity, depravity, violence, heartbreaking things occur.   You should also read Ennis's Punisher Marvel Knights run and his Punisher: MAX. MAX especially is one of the definitive runs on the character.   If you pick it up, I hope you enjoy it!"

comicbooks,3dwy83,Crash_Recovery,3,Mon Jul 20 11:31:14 2015 UTC,"Emerald Twilight, Zero Hour, The Final Night, and Day of Judgement are sort of the bare minimum, but is often not recommended since some stuff like Zero Hour is pretty dated and mostly served to retcon some stuff from CoIEs and to establish Hal as Parallax(stuff that pretty much got retconned by Rebirth anyways). A lot of it is explained in Rebirth through dialogue and the GL series that follows and often just better to keep on reading and if somehow still confused then best just to do the wiki cliff notes version."

comicbooks,3dwy83,Sibbo94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:01 2015 UTC,Johns created the concept of the Parallax entity so that means until Rebirth it was just that Hal snapped under weight of losing his home town and did a lot of bad things in trying to gain enough power to remake the world. Rebirth effectively swept all that stuff under the rug by say Hal had been possessed by Parallax and that is what was responsible for all those bad things.

comicbooks,3dth09,Yushityu,4,Sun Jul 19 16:31:37 2015 UTC,The Valiant was a great miniseries featuring most of the company's major characters.   Rai is probably my favorite ongoing series from them.
comicbooks,3dth09,Phoenix8008,4,Sun Jul 19 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend X-O Manowar, or Divinity. Valiant really has some of the strongest writing in the business, with some talented artists, so you really can't go wrong.   Bloodshot is a personal favorite, but it's  a bit ultra violent, if you're into action flicks check it out.  Harbinger is a bit raw in the beginning (I hate to use the term trigger warning, but there are a few places that it really applies) it does introduce my favorite character in all of comics however, Toyo Harada.  Ninjack is a fantastic spy series if your into those."
comicbooks,3dth09,LexFuckingLuthor,3,Sun Jul 19 15:55:23 2015 UTC,"Harbinger was my favorite title, but it went to #25 and ended (for now). Imperium picked up after that, continuing Harada's story. Based on an add in the Free Comic Book Day Issue, I believe they're going to bring back Harbinger again, along with Archer & Armstrong, but no official word yet.   Of series that are still active, I'd recommend them all, but my favorites are:   Imperium (by Dysart, just like Harbinger!) for it's collection of super villains fighting for utopia! X-O Manowar is suitably epic and spacey on occasion, somewhat like Hickman's Avengers. Ninjak, Bloodshot: Reborn, and Ivar, Timewalker all 3 kind of tie for newish series that are still growing into their potential, but are each very entertaining in their own ways. I also recommend you get your hands on the 4 issue mini-series The Valiant, if you haven't yet, and read that, followed by the new 4 issue mini that just started last week- Book of Death. Those two stories encompass the biggest overall stuff happening in the current Valiant Universe, and will give you a great glimpse at many other characters."

comicbooks,3du1cd,Myantics,17,Sun Jul 19 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"Alan Moore has not written any more stories in the Watchmen universe. A couple years ago, DC put out a few Before Watchmen miniseries that served as prequels for the individual characters in the original series. Besides a few stand-outs (specifically Darwyn Cooke's Minutemen and Silk Spectre), they were largely seen as unnecessary and not particularly compelling or quality stories. It remains to be seen if DC will announce a proper sequel to Watchmen."
comicbooks,3du1cd,jocab_w,7,Sun Jul 19 13:48:05 2015 UTC,Watchmen was very intentionally a stand alone story.  While DC gas layer followed up and released Before  Watchmen mini series showing characters before the main story I don't ever expect a sequel.

comicbooks,3du1cd,DeltaTester,4,Sun Jul 19 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"Try looking at the book as an exploration of print media (pre-digital) also. Moore dug deep when doing research for this book and the addendums  in the back of the Absolute Edition are required reading IMO. I love that these characters were originally going to be the Charlton comics characters (Rorschach = The Question, Nite-Owl = Blur Beetle, and so on), but because DC wanted to use them as they were Moore and Gibbons adapted those characters to the Watchmen as we know them.  The Before Watchmen books were an interesting attempt to do something with the characters, but it proves that the should be left alone.  That said, issue #4 of Multiversity (Pax Americana) is a good follow up to the concept of Watchmen and pulls the characters closer to the Charlton roots.  Thanks for this thread. It's been so long since I first read Watchmen I took for granted how awesome the first go-round with it is."

The prequels aren't really necessary, but I found a couple of them enjoyable and they changed my opinion of one of the characters from lukewarm to like.

There is not going to be anything else from Alan Moore in the Watchmen universe, he is too bitter about the whole thing with DC. I do not think he ever intended for it to go father than the original book. You could check out Before Watchmen. Some people like it, I personally did not even though I really wanted more Watchmen."

Particularly in that they both deal with a b or c list superhero coming to terms with that. Although Animal Man gets... weird. But in the best possible way. The most Morrison way."

You know who the avengers are if you've been watching any movies or tv at all, and the comic resets a lot of the status quo anyway. Its ongoing, although its caught up in a big maxiseries right now.  The two main parts are Hickman's Avengers and New Avengers, both of which should have current trades out.  That being said, if you really liked Daredevil you should see if you can go back and find any of Brian Michael Bendis' Daredevil run, classic, hugely influential on the show, very cinematic, and they reprint it every couple of years."

comicbooks,3duxqs,kamateur,3,Sun Jul 19 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"Some other great ones that get reprinted every other week are Grant Morrison's JLA (Justice League of America) series and the Authority.   The Justice League is DC's heavy hitters, and Morrison uses the (then) current lineup of the biggest stars, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc... only he pits them up against the kind of cosmic, eldritch threats it would make sense for them to be facing, invasions by Alien Shapeshifters, rogue superhero terrorists, cosmic gods coming to eat reality, that sort of thing. It moves very fast but the action is great.  This run heavily influenced Warren Ellis in writing the Authority a group of Superheroes he made up who basically still function as recognizable archetypes in the Superhero mode, there's a flying shiny guy, a dark broody badass, a magic guy, a tech guy, etc... but they have the craziest adventures. After, like, twelve issues Ellis handed the series off to Mark Milllar and I personally feel like it went in the toilet, but a lot of people like Millar's run just as much, if not more. So you could check it out and see for yourself."

It's kinda similar to James Bond or Mission Impossible, spy action with some campiness and suggestive humor.  If it turns out you enjoy it, you could also go back and read previous Dick Grayson stories, such as when he took over for Bruce as Batman. And whenever Grayson ends, you can be pretty certain that Dick will show up somewhere else before long. There is one trade out at the moment, I just got the hardcover from Amazon for like $12."

And you're right to lean towards Daredevil, it's my favorite currently running Marvel book. But also maybe check out Ant-Man, a good superhero book with a strong sense of humor.  Or, rather than going towards the big 2, try a Valiant superhero book. I'm partial to X-O Manowar, which (to me) feels like Iron Man meets Thor."
comicbooks,3duxqs,mcdougishole,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"I'll second Valiant. It's a superhero universe that was rebooted not that long ago. I like Archer and Armstrong.

I'd definitely also recommend Alias by Bendis and The Immortal Iron Fist by Ed Brubaker and Matt Fraction for the upcoming Marvel Netflix shows.  And to keep the theme of street-level recommendations I'm giving to you, I highly suggest reading Hawkeye by Matt Fraction. It's amazing and can help ease you into the superhero thing because it doesn't necessarily feel like a superhero book, but its set in the Marvel universe so you'll have interactions with other heroes and some superhero-y action going on."

And it won't even cost you money, they have every issue posted on their website for free (Atomic-robo.com), though you could buy the graphic novel collections in shops.  This is possibly the most fun you can have in comics.  It's action packed, heartfelt, and hilarious.  It's very good.  Anything by Brandon Graham.  Multiple Warheads, though kinda porn, is really good.  King City, which isn't porn at all is excellent, and his work on Prophet which is sort of a reboot of the Image series from the 90s is fantastic.  If you want something different Graham is definitely your guy.   Grayson put out by DC comics is kicking ass right now.  It's basically Dick Grayson as James Bond, and it's every bit as cool as that sounds.  Most work by Jason.  My personal favorite is I Killed Hitler, which is really a treatise on love and death if memory serves.  But really any of his work is worthwhile to read.  Danger Club was an 8 issue series put out by Image and it was amazing.  I know they collected the first 4 issues.  If the final 4 haven't been collected yet they soon will be.  Southern Bastards by Jason Aaron.  I think it's also image and though it's only about 9 issues in, I think it's one of the best, if not the best southern gothic tales I've ever read.    But if you've taken anything from this post I pray it's that you go read Atomic Robo.  Hands down one of the very best (in the top three at least) of comics currently being published.  *Edit: I forgot to mention Uber by Keiron Gillen.  Nazis and super soldiers in ww2, and if you think you know what that means, and what is going to happen, you are very wrong."
comicbooks,3dtb73,Captainj321,24,Sun Jul 19 06:33:01 2015 UTC,"Just the incredible density of crossover events that involve reading a bunch of titles. I understand why they do them, and I understand that I'm contributing to them continuing to do them by going out and buying all of them, but I still don't like it. They're disruptive to the real stories, and they're a huge hassle to follow.  The model of cross-over events that I'd prefer is this: There's one main book with the name of the event, and then everything else is optional. If there's a crossover event that involves Captain Marvel, the All-New X-Men, Nova, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star-Lord, and you're only really following some of those, you should be able to to just read the main event book and the books you care about and follow the event and what happens to the characters you care about. The worst type of event are the ones where it's one thread that weaves aimlessly through seven different titles and it's not at all clear which ones you need to read to follow the main thread. Maybe all of them? It's still disruptive to whatever's going on in the books, but at least you're not stuck reading a bunch of stuff you're just not interested in.  In a sense, Marvel's Secret Wars is this executed super well - there's one book you really need to read to get the big picture of the event, a few books that support that story but aren't mandatory for understanding it, and then a bunch of things that are people off in their own stories, operating mostly independently of the main plot."

I've stopped reading a lot of Big Two comics for that very reason.  I'm also really sad that the current trend is to make female characters who star in their own series immature, bubbly extroverts. I'm glad to see them getting more attention, and I'm glad there's more comics for younger girls, but I've gotten bored and unhappy with it really quickly. I miss my badass, intelligent women and complicated or nuanced relationships with others. Fortunately, Image is hardcore coming through for me, and Secret Six and Spider Gwen seem to be working out decently as well.

When an artist puts together a two-page spread, and some significant portion -- a character's face, for example -- is right in the middle, so that it gets smushed into the spine, warping the image, and you can't see it. That is called creep. Stop it already!  On a related note, two-page spreads with panels. A line of panels going across all of the left and right pages. Bendis does this far too often. I have to read many of his spreads twice. Breaks the narrative flow.  Lastly: I often see a 'surprise!' panel on the right-handed page. The best example of this is in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, in the scene in the Batcave in which a Boom Tube carrying future Superman flashes red and yellow across a big panel on the bottom-right of the two open pages. The rest of these panels are dark, for being in the cave. This BOOM! is supposed to be a surprise, but, as soon as you turn the page to this spread, it's the first thing you see. You then read the dialogue leading up to it. Surprises like this should always be on the top-left of a spread."

Even Dan Scott got death threats for Superior Spider-man yet we all know these stories are not forever when Marvel want to make money from the same character or new artist wants to try something new or old.  I was going to say the ads can be annoying but i do like picking up older issues and checking out what kind of ads they had years ago. All the forgotten movies and games. Though those Twix ads are going to still be annoying years from now.  In older comics there's something about the colouring and artwork that has something special about it.

Astro City has periodically engaged this, but that's all I've got. The only other examples are things like Preacher, which is awesome, but hardly is an authentic look at normal faith in a character.

My participation in that talk got me a PM calling me a transphobic piece of shit. There's also Airboy #2 which was very recent.  This is a little different, but remember the hullabaloo that Gail Simone and/or DC Comics were anti-handicapped people (I think the term is ""ablist""?) when they brought Barbara Gordon out of the wheelchair with the New 52?  As for racism, it took me a minute. They haven't been as high-profile lately. But here's a thread of people discussing DC being racist. DC seems to get it more often than Marvel."

It's aggressive cultural appropriation, while being denied as such. It's the same as if I were to go around listening to Rap and calling everyone ""Nigga"". Everyone would have a fit about it and call me racist for it.   In fact, it's likely I will experience the same thing here in this SUB for posting this.  Sure everyone can like comics, but that doesn't mean you have to walk in and just change everything about them, because you feel guilty about something someone else did to someone that isn't white. If you don't like what is already being offered, create your own characters, and books then. It's not that hard or expensive to get into making digital comics, and getting print ones made can be done relatively inexpensively compared to the old days.  Yeah I know, that sounds like work, and the tumblr crowd despises work, which is why they push their movement on a low commitment and low effort medium like tumblr... You know, instead of creating new comics.   I would love to read more stuff like DMZ, which was a Progressive Bastion of comic book making. What I don't like seeing is that push to destroy characters that already exist and have a particular feel to them. Destroying deep characters that had personality for surface value of ink color is simply ridiculous.  I stopped buying Marvel for this reason, and I will likely stop buying new DC if this continues. If you think that doesn't matter, I buy graded books. I have a collection worth a small fortune. I've been involved in comics since the early 90's. The stories are literally trash when they do this, and the characters have very little depth outside of having a different ink color added to them.   It's a sad attempt to appeal to groups that either don't actually care that the characters are not their race, or simply an excuse for SJW' to exercise power over others. Seeing how most of them are in the real world, it seems to me that it's like the power thing, that they feel gratified that they can ""exercise"" their power and change something visibly.   Either way, it either keeps going and I drop off buying new stuff and stick to 30 year old graded books, or it stops and people come to their sense and start creating their own stuff instead of trying to ride the coat-tails of the success stories. I also know that I am not alone on this."
comicbooks,3dtb73,artyblues,13,Sun Jul 19 10:17:17 2015 UTC,"The reason your ""create a new character"" idiom is untenable is because new characters usually don't sell. Why do you think there's multiple Batman, Superman, X-Men, and Spider books? Because people see a book with an unfamiliar character and walk by it, then the book doesn't sell, then guys like you say ""see? Nobody want's black for female characters"". It's just like the movie execs who make a female led movie and it's garbage and bombs, then say people don't like female led movies. SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY."
comicbooks,3dtb73,NidStyles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:54:16 2015 UTC,"Static Shock sold well enough to make a TV series about it. It did so, because the character fit well, and it felt real. It has nothing to do with unknown characters, because people do not buy into new franchises based on the cover, they buy in based on a few pages being turned on the shelf and word of mouth.   The classic characters sell well because the stories are fantastic, and the characters are well developed for the target audience, which is in general white males. Replacing Batman with a black person isn't going to make a well developed character. Just like it happened when they made Spiderman a black person. The character was poorly developed and felt very forced. The character was never targeted at black males. This is marketing 101 here, know your target audience, and do your best to not offend them, because people that walk away from a market have no issues taking their money to a different medium and never returning.  I would never say I don't want black or female characters, because I like all characters that are well developed. I am strictly against the appropriation of the culture in that I do not want to see the characters getting replaced with a differently drawn person with different tone of inking on them. It invalidates the culture and the character's fully as well as leaves a huge gap in realistic character development. The newest ""We Are Robin"", was a great example of good character development for reference (even if issue 1 was really short)... Forcing this equity on purchasers will only push people out of the market. Not only will it push people out, it will push the people that bring the largest amount of revenue to the market out. Which means you will kill your passions by not restraining your delusions of inequity."

Personally I find that book to be one of the best Marvel comics being released at the moment. I get giddy waiting for each new issue.

I don't like Disney, and am still miffed that they sold to Disney. If DC released one of these characters I would buy it. I have a huge Harley Quinn fetish, and actively buy her stuff.

It doesn't even make any sense, unless you are claiming that the Big Two are ""pandering"" to SJWS through changes to the characters. But then, that contradicts your argument that they are pandering to a group that doesn't even exist. What the hell is the mechanism here? Are there two people on Tumblr with thousands of fake accounts tricking Marvel and DC into thinking that a large number of fans would buy a new Captain America comic with Sam Wilson as Cap? Plus, given your complaints that this sub, with its 150,000 subscribers, is overrun with SJWs, it doesn't make sense to claim that they ""don't exist.""  It's classic conspiracy theory.

It's clear and obvious, the SJW's are stating clearly that they want to replace characters, and saying ""It's about time"". As if the only reason Peter Parker wasn't black was because Stan Lee, his creator. is a damn racist.   I'll be honest with you for a few seconds here. I don't care if you guy's take over Marvel and DC, because I know exactly what will happen when you guy's finally get your way. Comics will stop being popular due to lack of demand. Most of the progressives aren't paying for their books, they are stealing them. This same thing happened about 20 years ago, and the same thing is happening right now. Comic stores are sitting empty with hundreds of thousands of dollars of merchandise sitting on their shelves. Marvel and DC will get replaced by younger companies that do not pander to your crowd, which is what was happened when the first progressive push into the medium happened ~20 years ago. I was buying and collecting books during that era, so I know what happened then. I watched it unfold right before my eyes. The year the books from the big 2 started changing and pushing this progressive mess the two companies almost went bankrupt. Evil Ernie is a character you should learn about, and why he was so successful for such a poorly laid out plot should be obvious. Also, Spawn was a black guy."

I don't even look at posts unless they are linked on Reddit. I'm a Redditor through and through. On the other hand, I'm honestly pretty sick of the way that Tumblr has become a stand-in for everything some Redditors hate. It's a social media website. Based on my limited experience (and also talking about it with my sister, who is an active tumblrer, or whatever the word is), it's got a pretty big range of content on it. And so when people on Reddit attack Tumblr, I can't help but think that they aren't really talking about Tumblr, but about people on Reddit who they want to pretend ""aren't really Redditors.""   And that's the conspiracy logic I'm talking about. Honestly, it seems like recently, /r/comicbooks has become solidly ""pro-SJW."" And you can think all you want that this is an invasion from Tumblr, but I honestly think the reality is far simpler. You are simply incorrect about your perception of the political views and the demographics of the comic book fandom.   And I think you are incorrect not because things are changing, but because you are part of a reactionary movement that has become radicalized by its own perception that everybody else except for you is the real radical. Did anybody freak out when Monica Rambeau became Captain Marvel? Or when Bill Foster became Goliath, John Stewart was a Green Lantern, the new Dr. Light was an Asian woman, or an all new team of X-men was introduced who were multicultural.

All of those are collected in TPBs.  IMO Heinberg's original run and Children's Crusade are must-reads, as is Gillen's run (it's very different from the original series, though).

I don't hate them, but I'm not actively enjoying them like some older ones.   I loved the cover of Uncanny X-Men from the 90s where Colossus was trying to kill Xavier. I hadn't been reading X-Men at the time and that made me want to pick the book up.   That said, I love Revival's covers a lot of the time. Revival #11 Reddit #20"

comicbooks,3dsw7i,Zthe27th,2,Sun Jul 19 09:21:29 2015 UTC,You can't believe a university student who's hungry for comics can afford it right? I my self read a lot and I find it difficult to keep up with what I read. So I buy pretty much everything I read but not WHEN I read it. I'll buy them all eventually. Of course I'm subscribed to MU (god bless them) but too bad DC has not counterpart for that. So I end up downloading Infinite Crisis (for example) and I will buy it probably next month.
comicbooks,3dsw7i,blackdraka,4,Sun Jul 19 13:14:21 2015 UTC,But what is forcing you to read it right now instead of waiting?
comicbooks,3dsw7i,Zthe27th,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know, passion? Love? Interest? Cmon, don't be stubborn and face reality. If you read A LOT of comics you cannot buy them instantly. If you are a true reader you will eventually buy them. I cannot buy a 15 dollars volume and read it in a day. Then what? 15 dollars once again on the day after? I only work during weekends and study Engineer. What am I supposed to do?"
comicbooks,3dsw7i,blackdraka,3,Sun Jul 19 13:53:09 2015 UTC,No one is forcing you to read as much as you want. You aren't entitled to everything even if you want it. Torrenting comics hurts the sales of a small industry. Enjoying what creators put out is great but it doesn't put food on the table.
comicbooks,3dsw7i,Zthe27th,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"Now tell me. How does it hurt if I read something NOW and buy it THEN, instead of buy it only THEN? It seems to me that money will flow in both cases. But in case A I enjoy comics, in case B I get frustrated because I'm not able to afford everything.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that I don't live in the US. I live in Europe and I love reading books in English. So I have to import them."

comicbooks,3dsw7i,blackdraka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"I started reading comics via torrenting. I would never have read comics if it wasnt for that. I have also bought everything I first torrented (except for a few things, I dont have all of Transmet or Y because I am getting the absolutes). Sometimes Ive bought it in more than one format. I currently buy everything. I often double dip on stuff I love like anything Matt Kindt, Remender, Hickman, etc. My last dcbservice.com order was over $300 and I also have pull lists at two LCS' s. Not saying whether it is right or wrong, but in my case comics got a big supporter that wouldnt have existed without torrenting at first."

comicbooks,3dsw7i,Zthe27th,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"And that is one view point. Another is that stuff isn't free and just because you want to do something doesn't mean you can do it for free. I like to golf but they won't let me tee off for free so I can't do it as much as I want to. I guess I don't understand the share and share alike attitude if the content owners don't agree to it. Creators should have control over their work, both creatively and finically. Pirating takes that choice away from them.

Someone will probably be able to give you a better answer, but I can try and help. I commented on a few data base sites the other day, and that thread may help you out. HERE is a link to that thread.   I haven't seen this directly, but most of the sites will show all issues of a series, and give you an option to add it to your wish/want list with an option to print. http://www.comicbookdb.com/ should help with this. Sorry, not a clue. It could be a feature in one of the sites or programs I've tried, but I didn't see it. Not saying it is or isn't there, I just haven't seen or looked for it."
comicbooks,3dualn,halfAccurateChang,3,Sun Jul 19 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'll cut/paste a couple of sections of a recent post of mine that may help. The two I'm listing are data base sites that have bar code scanning. Let me know if you have any questions.  http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/ has a lot of nice features including an app with bar code scanner, all of which are completely free. I started to input my collection, but stopped about 10% through when I was finding a lot of series and issues missing. You can add missing series and issues with details, but it's time consuming. The creator of the site is on reddit, and has been great when I've had trouble, but the site still needs some improvement imho. If you don't have a massive collection, and/or don't mind assisting with additions I completely recommend this site. The creator was willing to take lists of missing series and issues to add, but may take a while as there's a big back log. Again though, cool guy and cool site. There's also no export feature, but the creator said he'd be willing to send me an export if I needed one.   http://www.collectorz.com/ is pretty sweet. I just downloaded two of the free trials (one for comics and one for games), and have been pretty impressed so far. The downside to that site is it can get spendy. $30-50 for each program and you'll need to kick out another $15 if you wanted the app. I'm considering picking up both the pro versions of the comic and game editions of the software, and that'll cut each program down to $40 each ($80 total instead of $100) with the bundle discount. You also get a discount code for $5 off if you download the free trial. EDIT: The app actually comes with a free scanner. I'm really impressed with collectorz so far.  EDIT: I should add that since the time of the original post I've purchased the pro collectorz game and comic programs and apps. It really is a solid piece of software."

comicbooks,3dtacd,DaveSilver,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"I was a little disappointed with the ending, but overall it's a very solid comic with a lot of great ideas in it.   My biggest issue would be how clear its influences are both in their previous work, and in the form of other comics. If you know your comic history, and have read a lot of the comics people say are essential or the best stories for certain characters, you will definitely notice a few parallels they create. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it was just very obvious to me.  Also, definitely pick up the 0 issue if you can, it sets up the story really well and is definitely worth the read."
comicbooks,3dw5fv,theforceds,5,Mon Jul 20 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"I actually liked Tim Roth's abomination, I wish they'd focused more on his character as a common person's reaction to The Hulk, thinking he's being the hero by undergoing a similar process to take him down and then losing himself along the way.  I don't think there was anything wrong with Ronan in Guardians, he was just pretty lackluster. I thought Winter Soldier had a pretty great selection of villains, and the ones they'll be reusing they kept around, the ones that were better as one-off villains they got rid of.   I also think there was a lot of potential for Justin Hammer and Whiplash in Iron Man 2, and I don't even think the final result was that bad."
comicbooks,3dw5fv,Arkadii,2,Mon Jul 20 01:08:07 2015 UTC,"Dude, Justin Hammer was great and he's shown up since. Once. So, Rockwell is open to the return, but I mean someone they can have in fight scenes.  Agreed on Abomination, especially since now they can almost literally cast anyone and bring him back. He's C.G.I. No $60 MILL marquee name. It's a good foil for Hulk. Not AS strong, but closest to him that there is, plus...doesn't care about collateral and can think/strategize.  Stane was great and had a suit. So, wasted one there.  Red Skull NEEDS to return. Like, seriously. I loved Darren Cross's homages to Ultron, too."
comicbooks,3dw5fv,Arkadii,3,Mon Jul 20 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with Abomination and Stane, even Rockwell to a degree, is that they aren't just foils: they're carbon copies. About half of the Hulk rouge's gallery is just ""Hulk but stronger"" or ""Hulk but smarter"". A lot of Iron Man villains too, which is why I don't want to see Stane pop back up again. He was good in the first movie, but more fights of Iron Man vs slightly different Iron Man armor is boring."

Like Suicide Squad meets Jason and the Argonauts.  Also, in bringing that up you're also really touching on another problem I have with Avengers: Age of Ultron. It was all just Avengers teaming up against a sea of robots. Replace robots with aliens and that's the first movie all over again. I was hoping for the Avengers working together against a single, larger foe. It would never happen, but something like Iron Man and company taking on a godzilla-like Fing Fang Foom. It would shake up the usual formula. Or, as it is in so many comics, a group like the Avengers taking on each other's villains in something like the Masters of Evil. I guess the problem with that in movies is trying to avoid everyone needing to have seen all of the earlier movies, but it still feels like a wasted opportunity."

From Ask Chris :    It’s the latter that the ’66 TV show went with, but Frank Gorshin’s portrayal elevated every one of his episodes into something incredible. But the influence he created there — the way he’d effortlessly transition from manic and giggling to cold homicidal rage with a single word, the outlandish plots, the sheer style that he brought to the role — would end up being passed down to the modern portrayal of the Joker instead. Compare Gorshin’s Riddler to Mark Hamill’s Joker on The Animated Series and you’ll see what I mean."

And I even watched it along side the Animated series and the Burton films. It holds up in a weird way especially for kids. My nephew really seems to like it, and it feels like an appropriate version of Batman for his age (he's 4). So to me the Batman 66 series has had a good bit of resurgence.   I know in the 80s and 90s there was a lot of backlash against it because of the direction the series and comics were taking. People maybe felt the need to make sure it was taken seriously, but I think people realize now a days that both types of Batman can exist together, and there has been a resurgence in the fandom (hell they are making a 66 movie for next year)."

It's fun to argue over whether Batman written as never ever laughing or whether he might actually tell Robin a joke are true to character. It's fun to argue about whether Wonder Woman would actively avoid killing an enemy or just see it as a practical solution.  No arguments apply to Joker. He's truly insane and thus all depictions are true.  Joker seemed mildly humane in this comic but sadistic in this one? Yup, he's nuts. He was written as enthusiastic and playful in this script but focused and bored in this script? They're both accurate, he's nuts.  All things are true for Joker."

Joker in Batman RIP is based on David Bowie - there's a chapter in the story called ""The Thin White Duke of Death"" named after David Bowie's persona ""The Thin White Duke"".  The Joker's eyes in the story also look like Bowie's: one pupil bigger than the other and hetrochromatic irises. David Bowie has different sized pupils as the result of an injury which makes his pupils appear to be different colors.  http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z98/TheJoker138/j001.jpg http://38.media.tumblr.com/e486502fea9781516039f4bc8a6e7229/tumblr_n4bti6ihAz1s1mb0no1_500.jpg  There's probably other stuff but that what I can think of right now.

comicbooks,3dndi7,metaphorm,34,Fri Jul 17 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"the Joker is just a terrible person who does things because they're funny.   is that his interpretation? Dini's joker is perhaps most extraordinary for being the least well-motivated version of the Joker of any major writer to address the character. Mark Hammil's voice performance was extraordinary and really brought the character to life, but the actual scripting for it was basically incoherent.  I think Dini actually saw the Joker as more like the straight man (such as it is) to Harley Quinn's whacky in a classic comedy duo situation. In Dini's stories Harley is the character with depth though, with the Joker being her foil and shallow love interest. It's an interesting role reversal actually, but it does leave the Joker as a little bit more flat than many other portrayals."
comicbooks,3dndi7,thehypotheticalnerd,63,Fri Jul 17 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree. I think not really getting a grip on his motivations is scarier. Because on one hand, this guy puts smiles on fish for giggles but then decides ""you know, I'm just gonna kidnap Robin, torture him, turn him into a grotesque abomination in my image, then tell Batman all about it.""  We see him in need of money and other times we see him just chilling in an abandoned world of tomorrow exhibit.  He is a chronic liar who manipulates Harley by giving her a false history and explanation for why he is what he is but Batman has heard plenty of other stories. Who's to say which one is true, if any.  Riddler may be E. Nygma but Joker is the true mystery. His former life is all but unknown aside from being a mob member at some point and no one knows why he does what he does. His motivations seem to change on a whim, if he ever even had true intentions. I actually enjoy him not having a defined reasoning for being. It's a distinct opposite to Batman's reason for being: vengeance for his parents and prevention so that he can prevent other children from ever going through what he did. My preferred interpretation of Batman is that every criminal he sees from a lowly gangster to Riddler to Ra's al Ghul to even Joker...are all just that mugger in the alley. Every single enemy he punches, it's the mugger in the alley that he's jumped. He was unable to do that then, this is his therapy. Every criminal is the one that took his childhood and destroyed his entire world.  Joker on the other hand, no one fucking knows."

comicbooks,3dndi7,huntwhale,2,Sat Jul 18 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't down vote this, but you didn't really prove your point. He is great because he seems to have no motivation, but his real motivation is to COMPLETELY destroy Batman, not just kill him. That would be too easy. He wants to make him as insane as he is. That's when Joker's the best."
comicbooks,3dndi7,JCelsius,25,Sat Jul 18 03:44:33 2015 UTC,"IMO to define his motivation is to miss the point of the character. Many of Batman's villains are insane but they still have a clinging sense of normality to them, which motivates them in understandable and somewhat predictable ways. Joker has gone so completely insane that he no longer has that normality and thus his motivations can't be understood. He still has motivations, but they aren't something a sane person can really predict or comprehend.  That's what makes him such a great villain to Batman. As a detective, Batman looks at clues and behaviors and uses them to predict what his opponent will do next. With Joker, he can look at the clues and the past behavior but he isn't able to 100% predict the villain's next move. Essentially, Wild Card. But let's not make the mistake that Joker is acting completely at random. A well written Joker has a master plan that he is working towards, but it's executed in such an obscure and unpredictable way that Batman won't figure it out until the end, if he figures it out at all."
comicbooks,3dndi7,metaphorm,24,Fri Jul 17 21:56:17 2015 UTC,"every writer has a different take on this.  Some emphasize the chaotic nature of the character, as you've just described. Dini might be in this camp. quite a lot of the monthly issues of Detective Comics and Batman have defaulted to this version of The Joker because it doesn't really require much explanation.  Others emphasize the ""in a crazy world, only the insane can be said to really be acting rationally"" aspect, a la Grant Morrison, a take that was successfully expanded on with Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker the  principled (to a point) anarchist.   Some writers emphasize that sadism, psychodrama, and obsession that is present in the character. Alan Moore probably captured that most quintessentially. The recent ""faceless monster"" Joker from Death of the Family was definitely in this archetype.   Finally, there is the more light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek campy version of the character that Cesar Romero made famous. this has fallen out of favor lately, but historically is probably the single most prominent version of the character: just a misguided clown who has discarded his morality in search of humor.   so circling back around, the first aspect, the one where Joker is portrayed as chaotic and incomprehensible, why is that such a common default? Wild Card is one thing but to me it seems like there's more to it than that. If the Joker is truly incomprehensible than he's not even really a human being anymore. More like a force of nature. Is The Joker, in this version, supposed to be so inhuman? Maybe that's the goal. He has a human form but isn't really a man at all. Just a personification of the capricious and uncaring nature of the world."
comicbooks,3dndi7,JCelsius,3,Fri Jul 17 22:14:19 2015 UTC,"You make many good points and I agree wholeheartedly. I think there are more ways to write him, and one is just as valid as the other. Personally I like the inhuman, incomprehensible, force of nature the best because I think it plays well off of Batman's nature but I enjoy other writers' takes on him too.  In the Killing Joke for instance he has a very clear motive, to make Jim Gordon as crazy as he is and show the world it can happen to anyone. That the Joker isn't some monster, but rather a normal guy who had one really bad day that changed him."
comicbooks,3dndi7,EdgarAllenPoeHunter,6,Sat Jul 18 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"A counterpoint to this would be Death of the Family, where Batman has a close understanding of the Joker's motivations and an ability to predict his actions.

A brilliant new modification of the human perception. More suited to urban life at the end of the twentieth century.    Unlike you and I, The Joker seems to have no control over the sensory information he's receiving from the outside world. He can only cope with that chaotic barrage of input by going with the flow.    That's why some days he's a mischievous clown, others a psychopathic killer.    He has no real personality. He creates himself each day.    He sees himself as the lord of misrule, and the world as a Theatre of the Absurd.""     -- Dr. Ruth in Joker.    Is the entirely filmography of the Joker secretly a tribute to Grant Morrison?

After a man named Charlie Collins curses at the Joker (didn't realise who it was) on the road for bumping him, the Clown Prince of Crime corners him and intimidates him and takes his details telling him that one day he is going to ask a favor of Charlie and Charlie better do what he says. Skip to 2 years later and Charlie is a nervous wreck in protective custody. The Joker shows up on his door telling Charlie its time for that favor. So Charlie gets in Jokers car distraught, certain he is going to die they drive up to a building get out and Joker tells Charlie that it's time for that favor... Open that door. Charlie opens the door for him Joker says thank you and sends him on his way.  2 freaking years scared to death of when the Joker will show up and what he will get him to do. 2 years the Joker sat on that to get him to open a door.

comicbooks,3dndi7,TrollingBaron,15,Sat Jul 18 02:34:41 2015 UTC,Yeah. Because it was funny then. If the kid didn't make a scene it wouldn't have been funny in his eyes.
comicbooks,3dndi7,andrewsad1,14,Sat Jul 18 03:49:56 2015 UTC,"Romero and Hamill are my two favorite Jokers because they do stuff because it's funny, period. Like that time Romero's Joker turned Gotham's water supply to strawberry jelly. Just for fun."
comicbooks,3dndi7,thefifthring,12,Sat Jul 18 02:03:02 2015 UTC,Uh... He glues his hand to the door and tries to blow him up....
comicbooks,3dndi7,veriix,3,Sat Jul 18 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but someone still needed to open the door. It's such the epitome of Joker when you think about it; an exhibition of foolharted insanity with a murderous twist in his favor."
comicbooks,3dndi7,alchemeron,2,Sat Jul 18 05:30:27 2015 UTC,"While I loved the TES and it was amazing how much mature content they got away with, it was fantastic to see their interpretation of the Batman universe without having to fight the censors.   Limitations can often breed creative solutions.  The idea of the Joker gas that was used in the series, where you're still alive but condemned forever to a life of madness, is in most ways a fate worse than death."
comicbooks,3dndi7,jatorres,20,Sat Jul 18 07:42:32 2015 UTC,Arkham series is almost the perfect Bat-everything to me.
comicbooks,3dndi7,mikeman1090,9,Fri Jul 17 23:03:17 2015 UTC,"except for the suit. it works well for the game because you can upgrade stuff and progress but for Batman himself, I personally thought it was too mechanized"
comicbooks,3dndi7,jatorres,3,Sat Jul 18 01:56:44 2015 UTC,Only thing I didn't like about the suit were the super pointy ears. I usually switch skins.
comicbooks,3dndi7,alchemeron,2,Sat Jul 18 02:10:27 2015 UTC,"Batman is just way, way too beefy (though we can partially write that off as an overall art style where most of the characters and enemies are huge).  Especially in that first game where you spend half your time ""stealthily"" sneaking through vents.  The design of it was more than fine, and I actually really liked the mechanized stuff in Arkham Knight, but the dimensions of Batman are wrong.  It would look fantastic on someone with a slimmer, Bruce Lee-like physique."
comicbooks,3dndi7,ShadicNanaya510,3,Sat Jul 18 07:45:14 2015 UTC,I never pictured Batman with a Bruce Lee-like physique. Most of the comics I read and the animated shows usually depicted him as a hunky beef cake.  Terry is probably closer to Bruce Lee than Bruce is. Dick probably has a similar physique too.
comicbooks,3dndi7,Kyoraki,5,Sat Jul 18 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Answering your edit,  this is a revised version of a picture that made the rounds on /r/batman yesterday. Mark Hamill was originally missing from the picture, and his performance (especially in TAS,  MotP, and RotJ) is largely considered to be the definitive Joker in those parts. So they added him in, giving him the appropriate title and screen space."

I can't see Joker sitting down and getting tattoos but if they were from what he used to be before he went insane, I'd be okay with it."
comicbooks,3dndi7,stroudwes,4,Fri Jul 17 22:42:05 2015 UTC,I've always thought learning the jokers origin takes away from the mystique of the character. It would be like criminals learning Batman is just Bruce Wayne.

comicbooks,3dndi7,bloozchicken,25,Fri Jul 17 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"It's not that it's insane for him to get tattoos, they just don't particularly seem that intimidating or as grand a statement as say, removing your face.   I'd even take a Joker lips/smile face tattoo, it's not a deal breaker or anything...it just seems off."

Then he makes those noises, laughs, and smashes the mirror."
comicbooks,3dndi7,TheElegantHobo,2,Fri Jul 17 21:56:16 2015 UTC,I could see the joker scaring the tattoo artist by telling creepy jokes and laughing randomly. All while he has a gun pointed to the artists head to get him to do it.

comicbooks,3dndi7,dacalpha,11,Fri Jul 17 22:31:26 2015 UTC,"I really dig the theory that this Joker is Jason Todd (the second Robin that was killed in the comics by the Joker). In the animated continuity, the Joker at one point brainwashed Jason Todd and turned him into the Joker. They could be doing something like that, meaning all the tattoos and stuff would have been put on him by the first Joker."
comicbooks,3dndi7,KandoTor,8,Fri Jul 17 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"Sort of correct, I guess. It was Tim in the animated continuity, and while the brainwashing sort of worked, he did turn on the Joker and kill him. The future Joker was due to an implanted computer chip in Tim's brain. I do think the Todd theory's really interesting for the DCCU, though, and that Jason tattooed Harley the way the Joker tattooed him.   EDIT: That last sentence doesn't really make sense. I meant to say I think it would be very interesting if they went that route, and it would make sense/be cool if Jason were responsible for Harley in the way that Joker was responsible for him."
comicbooks,3dndi7,dacalpha,4,Fri Jul 17 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"Haha I was a bit off, wasn't I?"
comicbooks,3dndi7,JTtheLAR,2,Fri Jul 17 22:51:29 2015 UTC,This would also explain Leto's physique as the Joker. He is obvious in pretty good shape. Robin would also be in peak physical condition. I would honestly be OK with this explanation in the movie.
comicbooks,3dndi7,Zand_Kilch,5,Sat Jul 18 01:22:10 2015 UTC,I think the theory is Todd sent Bruce the responsible guilt letter in New trailer and he will be Red Hood in solo Batman.  I think this Joker will have been Batman's enemy throughout this incarnation given the ages are the same enough
comicbooks,3dndi7,kingkwayy,3,Fri Jul 17 22:12:18 2015 UTC,Snyder's Joker did let the dollmaker cut off his face so this doesn't seem like a stretch to me. He was probably telling bad jokes the whole time and laughing. In my mind he probably had the tattoo artist family held hostage at gun point or something like that

He has his obsessions with villains like the Joker, his use of showmanship in order to make himself seem larger than life, and he can go overboard with the training and punishing of Gotham's criminals.  Most importantly, the fourth factor is how Batman differs: If Joker is comedy, Batman is horror. Both deal with the subversion of expectations, just with different outcomes."

Normally he'd have a hood on his costume that he could pull down but the Phoenix costume was something that Scott could create at will with the Phoenix Force powers so the whole thing would sort of just materialize when needed.

No one forced her to do it and from the interview I've read (I can look for it later) I got the impression that she simply did it to satisfy her inner fan girl. It reveals how selfish she is.   Curing the only iconic female character is huge. I cannot overstate that how huge that is. People don't really understand how disabled readers felt that day getting slapped in the face with a dead fish. There is no middle finger big enough.   Those replacements are nice but feel like a hollow gesture. ""It's alright guys, you can have these new characters! Don't be upset at us, please."" No one cares about The Movement. It was one of the worst books I've read in a long while.   See, you can't claim to be feminist while being complicit in taking away one of the few iconic disabled female characters. The anger I have over this will never go away."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,YodaFan465,9,Sat Jul 18 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"I might not have been clear earlier. When the New 52 started up, DC wanted to bring Barbara back as Batgirl, and they needed a writer. When Gail Simone heard about it, she asked to write it - not, I think, as a fangirl, which I think is an unfair assessment of her as a writer. She knew that most other writers would not have handled the issue sensitively, precisely because readers like you are so attached to the Oracle character. I mean, imagine what had happened if Scott Lobdell or Ann Nocenti had written the story. Simone actually did her research and talked to people like Andrea Letamendi (of Arkham Sessions fame) about making this story as real as possible.  Not for nothing, her run on Batgirl did a lot of ""rewriting"" of Killing Joke, which is a pretty vicious story to her (and I say ""to,"" because she's brutally mistreated by Alan Moore in the book). She has a gentler hospital scene with Bruce, and one of Joker's henchmen is revealed to be the man who called the ambulance to her apartment. And there's a really touching moment where Barbara's roommate discovers that Babs hasn't taken the wheelchair lift out of her van because she doesn't think of herself as ""cured.""   Lastly, did you read Simone's Nightwing/Oracle miniseries during Convergence? Long story short, Convergence as an event tells us that Oracle is still out there somewhere. Heck, I'd bet even money she shows up in Dan Jurgens's Lois and Clark series (which is a kind of sequel to the Triangle Era)."

The fact remains that she had no qualms about changing Oracle.   The point isn't that her work on Batgirl was bad, which it doesn't seem to at least later on. The first twelve issue were ass and then I stopped. I wanted to like the thing.   All of the things you list are at best damage control and dance around the main point."

That should be evident with only a casual glance, no?   It all goes back of how writers view and treat disability, which is often a burden and a dramatic plot point and something that needs to be gotten rid of because it's nasty and unwanted. Also there are people like you that explain to me that it shatters their suspension of disbelief. Please. We are talking about a medium that plays fast and loose with that sort of thing since forever.   How has it nothing to do with eugenics, though?

There's no reason to avoid actually killing him off.  Now I didn't have any issue with how Miles was introduced in the comics, because I thought Peter got a fair death, and because 616 Peter was still around, doing his thing.

Introducing Miles is the dead-end of using Peter in that continuity in any meaningful way, so what harm would there be in actually establishing him as dead?  This is actually something I've long wished that they would do when making a Flash movie, have it star Wally, but with the establishing element that Barry did in fact come first, but died at some point prior to the film to pass the mantle on. I'm sure Barry fans would not approve."

Something that I think is incredibly absent in a lot of movies. Particularly when its a white man and a black woman. The last movies I can remember that had a relationship like that was Lakeview Terrace and Guess Who. The problem with that is the only reason those movies had those relationships is because the story was about the relationship. I think that one of the things that keeps racism and homophobia alive is the fact that these relationships can't exist in entertainment without needing to be a spectacle.   This would have been a good chance to do just that. Its a story about superheros, and they happen to have an interracial relationship in it."

Remember that Liam Neeson's name draw was as much of a factor as whether he could perform the role. I imagine Alexander Siddig could have performed the role well enough, but he's less of a box office draw, a TV star not a movie star. Also, since that movie was attempting to deceive the audience as to Ra's identity, the ""white washing"" actually helped with the deception.

comicbooks,3dr3u0,suss2it,8,Sun Jul 19 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"This is why we talk about ""equality"" but what we really want is ""equity"".  Equality would mean no double-standards. If you were to race-swap a minority for a white or a white for a minority, all is equal. ""It's only fair!"" is the argument of people like the question-asker who don't seem to get what Brevoort is talking about.  Equity is the real goal. Equity means everyone gets treated with dignity; everyone gets a chance to thrive. And equity IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. Sometimes, ""unfairness"" has to be introduced to a system to correct for another inherent unfairness. That's why it's okay to swap in a minority but not as okay to swap in a white. It's not equal treatment. It's equitable treatment.  Equality: attempting to fix a wobbly table by putting equal-sized shims under each of the four legs.  Equity: fixing a wobbly table by putting a shim under the short leg."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,johnlongest,2,Sun Jul 19 05:48:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying, but the meaning of the word ""equity"" is literally fairness.   equity /ˈɛkwɪtɪ/      noun (pl) -ties       the quality of being impartial or reasonable; fairness an impartial or fair act, decision, etc (law) a system of jurisprudence founded on principles of natural justice and fair conduct. It supplements the common law and mitigates its inflexibility, as by providing a remedy where none exists at law   I think what you said about equality is spot on. And equality is not what we're getting from publishers, and is probably, right now, not possible given the buying-interests of the general comics consumer base; a 1:1:1:1:etc ratio of male:female:white:black:straight:gay:etc-led books is unlikely because the consumers of this media favor white-male-led books. That tide may be shifting, but, for now, this is the state of affairs.   I think what we're getting now are attempts to even the keel of comics diversity. This story goes something like this: ""There are X number of popular white-male-led books with titles that are household names. Let's make this one old, this unworthy, and this one merge with his evil ""son"" who is an artificial intelligence - and now let's pass the titles (both of their books and their literal mantles) to female-, persons of color-, and non-heterosexual characters and use the selling-power and inherent inertia of these titles to show that these minorities can be the leads of compelling stories while making comparable amounts of money for our corporate interest."""
comicbooks,3dr3u0,Shiniholum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"(If I seem terse here it's not because I don't think I owe you a thoughtful reply -- I am in the middle of a move and bone tired from packing.)   Yes, equity = fairness. When I say equity is not always fair, I mean that policies that create equity are not always fair, or rather, are unfair for the sake of fairness. Affirmative action is one such policy. Note that I'm not just going by dictionary definitions, but by some jargony academese of scholarship regarding equity vs. equality. Using ""equality"" in place of ""equity"" serves for everyday use. Like: people talk about ""marriage equality"" when they really mean ""marriage equity"" (after all, the marriage laws were equal before -- both heteros and LGBT were equally allowed to marry people of the opposite gender) and no one gets confused. But in these straw man arguments that run something like ""how can you call it equal rights when minorities are getting an extra boost? That's not fair! WWHHHARGARBL!"" the distinction between equity and equality is a good one to make.   2.   the consumers of this media favor white-male-led books. That tide may be shifting, but, for now, this is the state of affairs   I agree, but I don't think the tide wil shift unless major publishers start offering other choices. Be careful of self-fulfilling prophecies.   As a fan, I find the ""passing of the mantle"" solution to diversity to be pretty annoying. It depends on how it applies, I guess. Danvers becoming Captain Marvel seems fine, it's a mantle that's been passed around before. Kamala then taking Ms. Marvel is acceptable, I think, because despite the name she's such a unique and awesome NEW character. Sam as Capt. America though? I don't know... what was wrong with him being Falcon? (Although I like the Old Steve Rogers character.) And I don't even know wtf is happening with Thor. And this Bobby Drake thing is just so fucking aggravating.   But, my argument about equity still stands -- Bobby suddenly being gay is an outrage, but less of an outrage than Northstar turning straight would be.  But I think you've correctly identified why they do it, and it's their prerogative to act as corporations... so... If story suffering some now and then is the cost of Marvel staying relevant (and solvent!) sobeit, I guess. It's like, if Pixar has to cash in with another fucking Cars movie so that I can watch my Ratatouilles and Ups, it's the price I pay.  I'm so tired.  EDIT: Idk wtf is happening with formatting and I'm too tired to fix it."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,frankgogol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:34:28 2015 UTC,"You've not come off as terse, but rather respectful and thoughtful. Your elaboration on equity makes a lot of sense to me now.   I think the current trend of mantle-passing to non-white-male characters is the compromise big publishers have made to push diversity. All are essentially the same thing - a minority (woman, black, gay, etc.) character, existing or new, is passed the mantle of a well-known hero. For the sake of variety, I suppose, the circumstances of said passing have been different (character becomes unworthy, character is drained of his powers and becomes old, and so on). It's these circumstances that inform the comics readership's reaction, which often is a matter of personal taste and not everyone can end up happy. Done well, it can be an effective way to promote diversity in the medium and tell a good story. Done poorly, it's another step backward for diversity in comics. I say it's a compromise because the publishers, Marvel for instance, are taking a chance. Whether done well or not, if the readership doesn't have interest in reading a black or gay or female superhero, the book won't sell as well. Do this enough, and one of two things happens: either you lose your entire readership, or people read the more diverse offerings. Recent historical trends suggestions the latter:  We can take Superior Spider-Man (which I recognize is not passing a mantle to a non-white-male character, but the initial readership reaction was outrage) and Mile Morales as examples of this. Peter Parker was ""killed"" twice. Each time he was replaced and the readership seemed outraged (I am of the opinion that community of outraged comic book fans is not nearly as large as it appears on the internet, but that's another conversation). Allegedly, ""everyone"" was going to boycott the books, but that's not quite how it went. Superior went on longer than anyone had imagined, and the character has become a fan-favorite, and Miles Morales is still around 4 years later and selling well. Similarly, Ms. Marvel and Thor are showing staying power, which means people are buying the books, and book sales are much more telling than a popular internet opinion."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,Shiniholum,14,Mon Jul 20 14:03:17 2015 UTC,"I feel this whole debate about race in comics really dials back the amount of depth we prescribe to any person. As if to suggest that racial signifiers are the only way that a person is able to make a connection to a character when there are a whole slew of other ways: religions, hometown/cities, etc. I don't know why the floodgates aren't opened and characters are given more depth than just the color of their skin.       Couldn't this be detrimental in a way, possibly suggesting that the key element of a hero or person is the color of their skin? While I do support diversity in comics, I'm concerned that by focusing so much on racial elements of characters that they could be made less dimensional. Simply because if all the emphasis is on race alone then other aspects of their character will have to be less investigated."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,Readythedrums,13,Sun Jul 19 00:11:36 2015 UTC,"On an intellectual level I agree with your point, but I'm of two minds on the subject. I'm a Canadian Indian (feather), and while I've had no trouble growing up idolizing characters like Superman and loving the greek tragedy in the Batman mythos, there is something to be said for having a superhero that looks like you and comes from a similar place you come from. For me, in that context, the only superheroes that exist are Warpath and Thunderbird, and they're both kinda shitty stereotypes.  It's sort of like Wolverine being my favourite Marvel character. A lot of it at first was because he's Canadian, and that was a way into his character for me. Of course I was like five or six at the time I first learned about the X-Men, which is an age I imagine a lot of people first get into comics. In that stage, I can imagine that it's kinda cool to have somebody that represents where you come from, if not racially then culturally.   So yeah, while intellectually I think you make some sound arguments, and on the whole I do agree with them, there is something to be said to opening up the demographics as it were. I'm not sure that gender bending and re-casting race is the right way to go about it (I'm staunchly anti She-Thor, personally), but I can appreciate that it's coming from a good place."

Because they took over the Mantle. They are basically legacy characters. If the characters were the standard white guys no one would be Complaining. Seriously check out any other time someone took the Mantle from cap. No one complained. Thor either. But when it's a woman or a black guy suddenly legacy characters are bad or something.    they have the power to make otherwise unknown heroes household names. the guardians of the galaxy are a testament to that. instead they play musical chairs with existing names. then people result to shaming and bullying anyone who doesn't like that the character they liked being pushed aside entirely just to promote an agenda.   What agenda? And the big two aren't in the business of making ""new ""  characters. New as inNew ips that aren't related into established ips at all. Like the new characters rhey Make take over previously established brands aka legacy heroes. Ex ms.marvel miles, blue Beetle, new ghost Rider etc. They get their own books. Established brands sell. Unestablished brands don't sell. These companies understand that. That's why you see these legacy heroes becoming more popular.   New new characters usually get put on team books. Ex bunker, equinox, etc.    i think way fewer people would have problems with this diversity push if established characters weren't being thrown under the bus to do it.    Per your own examples Steve and odinson aren't getting thrown under the bus. They still exist. They still are in their books.    if you push falcon, and people don't like the dude then what the hell makes you think we want him as captain america?   What makes you think people don't like Falcon?    is the only thing selling the character the buzz and the ""hey look captain america is black, guys"" controversy?    No. It's selling because it's a good book and he's a interesting character. There isn't any sjw tumblr boogeyman Controversy. No one is tricking anyone. They promote them just fine.   its great to see luke cage will be getting a netflix series, and they're not trying to disguise it as something else. more of that. give these guys a chance on their own merit instead of trying to force everything.   People buy established brands. Nothing is wrong with legacy heroes."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,ribblesquat,9,Sat Jul 18 22:57:34 2015 UTC,Thor is not a legacy character.
comicbooks,3dr3u0,pineapplemikel,-2,Sun Jul 19 00:08:25 2015 UTC,Thor isn't but the woman(omitting spoilers) who took up the Mantle is.
comicbooks,3dr3u0,ribblesquat,11,Sun Jul 19 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"I really thought this was going to go in the other direction and already had a look of disapproval and shame on my face. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,pineapplemikel,2,Sat Jul 18 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"Stan wouldn't care if Donald Glover was cast as Peter Parker, he's already said as much. That said Donald Glover is probably the internet's favorite shitty actor, so I'd be pretty choked if they cast him as Peter Parker. I'd like some measure of acting ability behind my favorite comic character.   I've always said that diversity is important in comics, however it has to be natural diversity. Take how they're approaching Spider-Man post Secret Wars, they're doing it the right way. We didn't just wake up with Peter having been turned into Miles or randomly becoming Latino. Real diversity will always beat manufactured diversity. Give me new black characters to get interested in, new Indian characters, new Native American characters, new Chinese, Japanese, Korean... make them true to who they are instead of just taking the history of another character and slapping a new coat of paint on it. You want the perfect example? Ms. Marvel, she's a vastly superior example compared to Miles Morales: Ultimate Internet Race Debate Man."
comicbooks,3dr3u0,PleaseStopPostingPls,6,Sun Jul 19 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"I think the race-bending in movies isn't really that big of a deal. Nobody flipped their shit when they made Ultimate Fury look like Samuel L. Jackson because it was a new incarnation of the character and this is the same thing. That being said I think Stan hits the nail on the head with a lot of this though. Changing an iconic character's sexual orientation/gender/race isn't the way to go about getting more diversity. Making new characters like Miles and putting them into the roles is.  We are talking about movies here though which is a whole different ball game than comics. People gotta remember that studios and producers are the ones making these big decisions behind the scenes based solely on what they think is going to sell best. And you best believe they factor in race/sex/orientation with that. We've yet to see a real big name super hero movie with a female lead almost certainly because Catwoman and Elektra were shit. Not because they had a female lead, but because they were shit movies. But producers and studio execs don't see it like that, they see two female super hero leads bomb, that means market doesn't like em, that means we're not making them.  With FF they probably don't give a rat's ass about actually diversifying the super hero genre, which is why Sue Storm is still white. They think adding a black guy to the cast will sell better."

comicbooks,3dqvc2,Oddacon,2,Sun Jul 19 00:33:38 2015 UTC,I buy it monthly but I think its a better read in chunks.
comicbooks,3dqvc2,bigbigguy,2,Sun Jul 19 00:53:03 2015 UTC,"Lazarus is one of the best books around, for sure. My pull list undergoes some changes pretty regularly, but it's one of a small handful of books that I absolutely must buy monthly.  The world-building is incredible, on a level that few books attain. There's enough interest on all levels - characters, plot, premise, etc. - to engage the reader on every page, every panel. Also, keeping up with the single issues offers an incredible array of back matter that continues to expand the world. Fantastic book!!"
comicbooks,3dqvc2,IvorySwings,2,Sun Jul 19 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!!!! ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OUT IN THE INDUSTRY TODAY!!!!"
comicbooks,3dqvc2,wpisano,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:38 2015 UTC,The biggest criticism I'd level against it is that Rucka only knows how to write one kind of woman. She's his stock character transplanted into a futuristic dystopia. Another problem for me is that she's the least interesting element of every scene she's in - everybody else seems to have a lot more going on.
comicbooks,3dqvc2,Zerujin,4,Sat Jul 18 17:22:12 2015 UTC,Forever is an underdeveloped character and the least interesting part of the story.  I think this is an intentional plot point.  (She's also a very much off-the-shelf character.)  I like it because all the world building is awesome and the other character's motivations are intriguing.
comicbooks,3dqvc2,ThisbigBLACK,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:01:40 2015 UTC,The first part is on point but a deliberately boring character is still boring. This might pay off later down the road but makes the whole affair duller than it should be and becomes a huge problem when it's one fo the most important characters of the story.   I mostly read it because of the politics and everyone else.
comicbooks,3dqvc2,Zerujin,3,Sat Jul 18 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"It feels like she's truly discovering the world the same way we are. She's been a puppet and that's why she's been a boring character, although it's nice that we get moments like when she met the out Lazrus. This is a long form story though, so she'll probably develop much more."
comicbooks,3dqvc2,Jowser11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, elegantly phrased. Remember the scenes when she celebrated her 10th(?) birthday and she was trying to seek approval from her father? I feel like she still has the mental development of a ten year-old when it comes to relationships, and Michael Lark has done an excellent job at conveying that."
comicbooks,3dqvc2,marshmallowwisdom,3,Sun Jul 19 02:56:05 2015 UTC,Get it. I'd say it's one of the best/ most important books out there.
comicbooks,3dqvc2,JimmyMcShiv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:18 2015 UTC,Definitely recommend this book. Excellent artwork. Fantastic world building. There is quite a bit of palace intrigue mainly between the two main families. Due to the on-going war it seems we will get to see more of the other families very soon. The action has also picked up as well. Highly recommend picking it up.
comicbooks,3dqvc2,jtrent1388,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:48:19 2015 UTC,I get this whenever it's on sale at Comixology and am in the middle of rereading.

My concern is that Spider's main problem in life is apparently that he has too many fans and that his writing is just too well loved. You would think that an anti-social guy who goes around blowing up bars with rocket launchers might have more serious problems than that.  However, the setting is really interesting and that writing and art have a great flow.

That 4 issue Rocket series thats included in the collection is probably the first pre- 2000s comic i've read.  For somebody who hasn't read a lot of old comic books i felt it was a bit more difficult to get through and they weren't my favorite issues in the collection. I personally enjoyed the Annihilation stories more but i also enjoyed the The Hulk comic in the collection.  I don't know if i can really say why, i wasn't too big a fan of the art but i do agree that it looks like the artist was experimenting.

I think I'll save Criminal for last, as I just blasted through the first five books and they were consistently incredible. The sixth will be a special treat in a week or two.

comicbooks,3ds4kl,fartsareamusing,9,Sat Jul 18 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"JMS' run had some arcs that were better than anything during Brand New Day, but Sins Past and One More Day make it impossible to recommend to anyone. Those two arcs are so terrible that they drag everything else down with them.  Brand New Day is consistently enjoyable, which is quite a feat for a 100+ issue run with an entire stable of writers and artists, and there were some great stories like Grim Hunt and The Gauntlet."
comicbooks,3ds4kl,CorruptedEvil,4,Sat Jul 18 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like Sins Past and One More Day are worth dealing with for how good the rest of the run is, particularly the first 36 issues with John Romita Jr, which are just unbelievable.  And quite frankly, if I had to choose between never having had to read Sins Past but missing out on Back In Black, and reading both of them, I'd stick it through Sins Past every time, BIB is incredible."
comicbooks,3ds4kl,ChickenInASuit,5,Sun Jul 19 02:08:17 2015 UTC,It's also important to remember that Sins Past and OMD wasn't JMS. For example he wanted the kids to be Peters but the infamous Q-intervention felt like Peter having kids would make him unrelatable so they made Gwen have that sordid affair.
comicbooks,3ds4kl,Shiniholum,2,Sun Jul 19 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the story should have simply been shot down, rather than reworked. It was just a terrible idea in both versions."
comicbooks,3ds4kl,PROMITHEUS89,2,Sun Jul 19 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't read all of Brand New Day, but my god JMS was one of if not the best Spider-Man writers, he wins imo hands down.  He had a great Pete/MJ relationship, Spidey was constantly out of his depth and thinking on his feet to win while cracking jokes, Back in Black is one of the best serious written Spider-Man arcs (Grim Hunt is reallll close,) there were so many new villains throughout the whole run which was refreshing, the characters felt grounded and, the jokes were mostly funny too.  Happy Birthday Spider-Man and Back in Black alone are worth looking past Sins Past and One More Day."
comicbooks,3ds4kl,JoeScotterpuss,4,Sun Jul 19 05:08:02 2015 UTC,"So I recently finished all of ASM Brand New Day after having finished all of JMS' Spidey run, and I think I honestly prefer Brand New Day.  JMS' run has about 4-5 stories that I really like. They are:  -Coming Home  -The ""Vegas Thirteen"" arc (with the zombie monster made of mobsters)  -Issue 50,  -Back in Black, and  -whatever issue in which Spidey talked to that kid who was dealing with serious issues at school.  But I can think of about 8 stories from Brand New Day that I like just as much, some even more. They are:  -Issues 555-557 with the God from another dimension (I love this arc, Chris Bachalo's art is amazing).  -Issues 559-561 or the ""Paper Doll"" arc, this arc was really heart-warming, had great writing and had clever jokes that actually made me chuckle, which is always great to have in a Spidey book.  -New Ways to Die. This arc had art from John Romita Jr, and for whatever reason his art here was actually a bit better than it was in JMS' run, enough that some of the art in New Ways to Die really increased my enjoyment of this arc. The symbiotic art, for instance, was awesome. Not only that, the writing was excellent. That fight with Bullseye was fantastic.  -issues 575-576, this arc had Bachalo doing excellent work with pencils again, and was well-written.  -“Crime and Punisher” I wasn't a fan of Paolo Rivera's art at first, but after seeing his One Moment in Time covers I came to appreciate how talented he is, and I actually liked his regular pencil work as well. And this story also has good writing and action, so it gets an A+ from me.  -Grim Hunt, and the Sandman and Mysterio parts of the Gauntlet and possibly a couple of other stories.  I also preferred the art in Brand New Day. Which isn't to say I don't think the art in JMS' run is good, John Romita JR, Mike Deodato and Ron Garney are all excellent artists. It's just that for whatever reasons, John Romita Jr's art in New Ways to Die, for instance, seems a bit better than his art in JMS' run, even though his art in JMS' run was good.  I know JMS' run only has 73 issues, whereas Brand New Day had 102, which might be why there's more material in Brand New Day that I enjoy. But I actually love a lot of the stories from Brand New Day, and feel I prefer that era. This may be because that’s the first era of Spidey I read, but anyway, which run do you prefer?"
comicbooks,3ds4kl,Shiniholum,3,Sat Jul 18 22:48:51 2015 UTC,"I'll take JMS over any of the stuff past it. To me it's the only time I've felt that Peter had any truly organic growth.

Not only that but hot tamales can JMS write a great MJ... I miss MJ written well."

comicbooks,3ds4kl,PROMITHEUS89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"JMS' run has some bright spots (mostly the stuff with Romita Jr.), but its low points are ridiculously bad.  BND gets a lot of flack for coming out of OMD, but, even with a small army of writers and artists, managed to keep a higher quality consistency. It also gets a lot of points for doing its best to give Peter a good and entertaining supporting cast, after JMS ignored everyone but Aunt May and MJ. I feel that the supporting cast is a large part of ASM's identity and you just need it there if you want to read like a Spider-Man story, rather than a random super-hero comic."
comicbooks,3ds4kl,Ghostleader6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"JMS' run had some of my favorite moments like Coming Home, Doomed Affairs, Saturday in the Park with May, The Coming of Chaos, Happy Birthday and Back in Black.  The reason I liked them is Peter, MJ and Aunt May have character development like Aunt May knowing and accepting Peter is spider-man, Peter becoming a teacher to help kids. Another moment that made me love JMS' run was Peter in Back in Black. Peter just beats Kingpin to a pulp in front of everyone in the prison."
comicbooks,3ds4kl,nubosis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, JMS was one of the few writers of Spiderman who were able to develop his supporting cast.

As much love as I have for Batman: Year One, The Dark Knight Returns, Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, The Long Halloween, etc. there's something about Black & White that really captures the essentially mythic nature of Batman. It's not about him saving the world or saving Gotham, or even fighting supervillains. A great deal of the stories are about Batman as an actual detective solving crimes, protecting people, fighting street-level threats. The constantly changing art styles and storytelling techniques also really emphasizes, like, Batman-as-urban-legend. Each take is an equally valid, if completely unique, vision of the character. Their cumulative overlaps are the essence of what ""Batman"" is."

comicbooks,3dsutq,Bentendo64,6,Sun Jul 19 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"Here's some recommendations. I stayed away from superhero comics as best I could, favoring books that have historical or culturally relevant themes:  Amelia Rules - series about a girl with divorced parents. Slice of life stories that are funny and touching as well. Big appeal for girls, stories kids can relate to.   Jet girl - can't remember the author but he has a bunch of books that are great all age fun.  21: The Story of Roberto Clemente by Wilfred Santiago - excellent book that focuses on the life of the man rather than stories about baseball. Clemente was a big social activist. The art style is exciting and dynamic.  Andre the Giant by Box Brown - biography of the wrestler. Appeals to more than sports fans.  Maus by Art Spegelman - Pulitzer Prize winner about the authors father's time in a ww2 concentration  camp.  Persepolis - life in Iran as a teenage girl. Autobiographical. Excellent book for young people, boys and girls. Highly recommended.   Family Matters  by Will Eisner (or most other graphic novel by Eisner.) Dynamic art style   Nat Turner by Kyle Baker  Ms Marvel - ongoing series by Marvel about a teenage girl who gets superpowers. Kind of a 21st century spiderman type story, except she's a girl and struggles with wanting to date boys and be independent despite her Muslim family's traditional values. The religious aspect isn't played as evangelical, it could be a Catholic or Jewish family, it's used as a theme.   Fun books:   I think Calvin and Hobbies are great for any age. Light, fun, but the comics have some ideas behind them about imagination, getting in trouble, sweet interaction between parents and kids.   Mighty Skull boy Army by Jacob Chabot.  Funny with a super appealing style. An evil villain Skull boy is a kid who is trying to take over the world with his henchmen: a monkey and robot.  Good for teaching analysis of story structure and timing.  Edit: the recent Batgirl ongoing series and Gotham Academy are worth checking out.  Best of luck!"

comicbooks,3dsutq,krakencircuses,3,Sun Jul 19 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"Bone by Jeff Smith -- Three brothers find themselves caught up in the affairs of the people of a strange and magical valley. Not Superhero-y. It is fantasy. Excellent visual storytelling.  Thieves and Kings by Mark Oakley -- A boy and his imp are sworn to protect a princess. But does she need anyone to protect her? Again, not superhero-y. It is fantasy. Mixes comics with prose storytelling. It's actually my favorite comic. The art is a little dodgy in volume 1 but it gets better. Very appropriate comic for sixth graders -- it's a Bildungsroman of sorts with several young protagonists.  Ultimate Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis -- A well-regarded version of the Spider-Man tale that's perfect for that age group. This was set at the very beginning of the ""Ultimate Universe"" so the kids don't have to know any old continuity.  Runaways by Brian K. Vaughan -- Six teenagers learn their parents are a shadowy group of supervillains, while coming to grips with their own nascent superpowers. This takes place in the main Marvel Universe, but aside from a few references, the readers don't really need any familiarity with past comics. Some of the themes might skew a little older than grade 6 (love triangles, hating your parents) but it's still kid friendly."

comicbooks,3dsutq,tylerbateman,2,Sun Jul 19 07:23:53 2015 UTC,"I might recommend getting a collection of classic comics, such as first volumes of Spider-Man or the Fantastic Four. They are solidly aimed at kids about that age, have solid art, and good storytelling (for the time, at least!).  For more modern stuff, I would second the reccs for Bone and Runaways and Ms. Marvel, and I would add Usagi Yojimbo to the list. Great stuff there."

comicbooks,3dshxy,CorruptedEvil,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:39 2015 UTC,I liked it more than All New X-Men but I know that there's probably more people that think oppositely.  There's an OHC coming out that would be worth it if you just want the story instead of the singles.
comicbooks,3dshxy,bobdylan777,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:42 2015 UTC,Best to wait for the post Secret Wars releases. Maybe pick up the last Bendis issue when it comes out and see if there are threads that you want to follow up on. The Bendis run was okay.  We did get some new characters out of it and there was a time travel story in the annuals that I liked. I think his heart was in All New.

It's one of the worst titles Marvel have published in quite some time. Dialogue is sloppy, plotting is practically non-existent, issues go nowhere and end suddenly with no cliff-hanger or resolution, half of the art is awful (Kris Anka) and half is an acquired taste (Bachalo). There's pretty much nothing to recommend it."

The X-men main title and Amazing I don't think are as good, I have only read the first Arc of each. I have not read any of the X-force books and only a few issues of X-men legion. Now to you actually question All New and Uncanny are my favorite ongoings by Marvel. Present Cyclops and Magik have become 2 of my favorite marvel characters since starting. The Magento series that spins off of Uncanny is great as well."

I'd start with vol 1 Power and Responsibility and go from there.   The first 4 volumes of the original USM are more or less the ""bible"" of the series, defining and introducing all of the major players. From there you should read the Death of SPider-Man at the very least as an introduction to miles."

Then there is Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man. Just start there and see how you feel about it.  Other Ultimate books: I think Ultimates Vol.1 and 2 by Mark Millar and Brian Hitch are awesome.They really started something.  I liked Ultimate Comics: X - an X-men book post Ultimatium. I don't know how that would read out of context, but there it is.  There were a couple of Ultimate FF arcs that were fun (Marvel Zombies started in Ultimate FF), but most of it seems inconsequential now.  Maybe the Hickman run on Ultimates? The Ultimate Reed Richards that is in Secret Wars gets a lot of play there."

Robinson wasn't a stellar run but I will say this: it wasn't bad either. I liked the art in the book, even though there was like five different people that worked on it.

I would suggest Kieron Gillen's Young Avengers for the same innovative layouts and more Kate Bishop or his Journey Into Mystery for something different than normal heroics.  If you like Batman I would try Moon Knight, Warren Ellis just finished a great 6 issue run earlier last year and it was phenomenal.  The Hudson run from 2005(?) was also great. Brian Bendis did a dark, gritty, noir, Daredevil run in like 2003 that you would probably enjoy too.   If you like Deadly Class I would read Uncanny X-Force (2010 I think) same writer and easily one of the best things to come out of the big 2 in recent years.

My name is stratofarius, you've probably seen me around here, I tried to launch a read of the Ultimate Marvel verse that didn't go anywhere because, of course, I happened upon personal problems that essentially put a wrench on all my plans.  Anyway, that aside, I've been waiting for the weekend lounge for a while. You see, I'm part of a play-by-post roleplaying game located on the TVTropes forums called 'Justice Avengers'. You can already guess what the theme is about, but the general idea goes: the Marvel/DC universes have been rebooted into being the same universe. As such, players can choose a myriad of characters, mix and match their origins or even just mash two characters into one.   We've been going for three years with three games under our banner- New York for a more balanced mood (dark and light), Jump City for the sillier stuff and Hub City for the darker stuff- and we're about to launch a fourth, based on the cosmic and magic sides of the comicsverse. I'd like to make an invitation to anyone interested in participating on this game, seeing as the r/comicbooks community is filled with a plethora of well-spoken and quite creative individuals that I think would make great players.  So if you're interested, I'll be linking to the signup thread for the main game, where you can find links to the other games. We're open to comics fans of any kind, from those who've been reading for years to those who have only watched the movies.   I hope to see some of you guys there."

Its a deep dive into the background of Clint and Barney, with the other half of the story talking about Clint and Katie Kate doing a side job for SHIELD.  So it loses that Bed-Stu, street level, feel of the Fraction run, but i gotta tell you, its pretty good man. There are two artists, one doing the backstory in this, almost, water colory kinda way, and the one doing the shield story in a very ""Marvel NOW"" kind of style.   Its pretty good dude. check it out.  just, you know. dont expect Hawkguy level of quality. Thats....   ...over now :'("

For everyone who doesn't know, I'm Eddy aka Siksaw, creator, editor, writer, guitarist and lead singer of a project called The Nine Choirs. I Decided I would be a bit more formal this time around.   My team is reaching the end of a long chapter in our book. We've set August 15th as the release for both our demo EP and black and white comic. Both should be available digitally in a few places a short time after.   We've unveiled another of our characters this week. Here's the blurb on him:  ""An Angel of Death that fought alongside Abaddon for millennia, Ezekiel is a force to be reckoned with. He uses a non-traditional chain and scythe to put down both creature and Angelic alike. With Abaddon as a mentor, he worked his way up the ranks to God's guard and now has to face a difficult decision.  Will he choose to follow the laws of Haven as every Angel of Death swears to or will be betray his realm to help out an old friend?""  Our graphic designer has also made our second 2/3D shape. We've dubbed it ""The Pyramond""  As always, if you're interested in anything I've said just ask and I'll gladly answer any questions.   You can follow us on Facebook for Comic and Band updates.  Thank you!"

comicbooks,3dqec1,Siksaw,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. Our project is very much like Coheed and Cambria and The Amory Wars. We've made a universe and are using both mediums to tell you a story.   Our comic focuses on giving our audience the main story which uses the age old archetypes of good and evil to talk about the bigger topic of morality. I quickly wrote a synopsis on it a few weeks ago on another Weekend Lounge that I think is a decent elevator pitch for it:  ""The story follows a young man's journey as he loses his faith in God only to have God enter his body. God, who's name is Abaddon, tells Creed that he needs his help to return back to Heaven.  Along the way, Creed learns that Heaven isn't all fluffy clouds and naked Cherubs. Abaddon lost his throne for a reason and getting him back there isn't going to be easy.""  Our band writes songs that add more to the story by giving more insight on certain characters or events. It isn't necessary to have both to enjoy either but simply adds more to either experience if you want."

comicbooks,3drygk,Giantjester,2,Sun Jul 19 11:44:05 2015 UTC,It's genuinely a really good series. It's tragic but still manages to be exciting. It explores a lot of what drives a hero to be heroic and the subsequent reactions from law enforcement  and the media that don't normally get explored.

comicbooks,3du0ip,Sibbo94,4,Sun Jul 19 13:35:28 2015 UTC,"This is pretty common for Marvel these days. When an new creative team comes on or a big status quo shift happens they start a series at 1 again, to hint to people that it's a good place to start reading and to boost sales."
comicbooks,3du0ip,Crash_Recovery,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I understand the occasional need for starting from issue one, but from the get-go, Marvel advertised the current Spider-Gwen series as an ongoing, when in reality, it's only five issues long. A few years ago, they restarted Wolverine with an Issue #1 only to start it up again after about 11 issues until they started it up AGAIN only to kill him off 8 issues later.  Again, I don't mind issue 1's. They introduce a new generation of fans to a story from a defined beginning, but characters like Spider-Gwen already have a fanbase and they want more! We don't want yet another issue #1 to come out the same year as the original #1 came out it in. That seems a bit ridiculous. Plus, it's the same creative team, and as far as I can tell, she's still in her own universe, so there is NO status-quo change whatsoever."

But after 4 issues, they forced him into the mediocre Spider-Verse only to cancel his series after 12 issues while leaving major plot-points unresolved. Now, they expect me to be grateful they're starting up with a NEW #1 this fall? Not even a year since the beginning of the last series?"
comicbooks,3dpxam,SaturdaySmile,44,Sat Jul 18 08:22:04 2015 UTC,"It really does come down to whether or not it fits with previous portrayals of the character. Shatterstar worked, Richter was a bit more of a stretch, but ultimately not that many people cared enough to worry about it. Northstar was easy, Iceman was complete nonsense and completely out of step with previous depictions of the character (and not in that ""maybe he was just in the closet"" kind of way, given the differences between literature and real life).   I believe that they should never ""change"" a straight character to be gay (or vice-versa), but it is all right for them to pull ""passing"" characters out of the closet. They just need to honor all previous appearances of the character when they do so, revealing a trait that was previously unexplored, not creating a trait where none existed."
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,15,Sat Jul 18 08:51:03 2015 UTC,"I think it usually would make more sense for a long-time character to come out as bisexual instead of just gay, like Psylocke did a while ago."
comicbooks,3dpxam,centipededamascus,7,Sat Jul 18 09:59:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, bi is certainly easier to pull off, as it gives them more options without devaluing all their previous romances."
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,13,Sat Jul 18 17:33:35 2015 UTC,Not disagreeing with you but it is still possible for people that are seemingly heterosexual to find out that they are gay later on
comicbooks,3dpxam,Kaijew,21,Sat Jul 18 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"In real life, yes, but I think that's harder to pull off in fiction, where the reader 1. views the character when nobody is observing that character and they have no reason to conceal their true feelings, 2. has a view into the character's ""thought bubbles,"" and can actually hear the character's true feelings about other characters, and 3. when that character lives in a world chock full of nosy telepaths who surely would have stumbled onto such a major character trait had it existed.   Given Bobby's extensive history as a character, it's pretty much impossible that he was ""fully gay"" the entire time and managed to hide it from everyone, including the reader. Bisexual, maybe, but even that would be a huge stretch in his case. He was depicted as really and truly loving women, and distinctly being uninterested in guys too often to buy it."
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,2,Sat Jul 18 17:39:52 2015 UTC,yeah I know I agree with you that it's different in the case of fiction. I just wanted to remind people reading the thread that it can happen.
comicbooks,3dpxam,Kaijew,6,Sat Jul 18 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think that's actually a very interesting story and I am cool with that.  However, you need a mature writer who is capable of taking a good long look at social pressure and how and why people conform to it even when they think themselves independent.  That is cool and good writing.  A deus ex machina of ""Poof! You're gay and you've always been gay!"" when the character has demonstrated multiple times in the past of being heterosexual is just poor writing and I don't trust the writer to actually treat the character as being more than a label."
comicbooks,3dpxam,Wulfenbach,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:49:52 2015 UTC,Yeah but homosexuals dating and having sex with women to cover up their sexual orientation is a real thing.
comicbooks,3dpxam,ManofBatz,2,Sun Jul 19 06:20:28 2015 UTC,"but learning that they've been gay all along changes the nature of their relationships with women, if say it was revealed that aquaman was gay and had been for a long time before that would change the meaning behind his relationship with Mera. saying that he never thought about her like that at all and that he was unhappy the whole time is a big deal."
comicbooks,3dpxam,harryboom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:29:32 2015 UTC,Yeah i know. Its such a difficult topic to approach with comic books because personalities can change with the whims of writers
comicbooks,3dpxam,ManofBatz,4,Sun Jul 19 07:21:17 2015 UTC,The problem with this is the assumption that someone is/has ALWAYS been straight/gay/bi/etc....  Really sexuality is way more fluid with that.  The best policy I think is when someone tells you they are straight/gay/bi/etc just accept it and if they decide later to tell you something different just accept whatever they say about it.  I feel it should be the same here.  Just accept it since it really is such a fluid aspect.
comicbooks,3dpxam,Jikend,6,Sat Jul 18 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"In real life, sure. People have agency over their own life and other people should respect that.   In fiction though, characters do not have any agency over what a writer chooses to do with them, and unless the character was written only by a single author, it's fairly likely that an ""outed"" character was never originally created to be gay, so it's reasonable for fans to reject a depiction of the character that seems out of context with that character's history. This does not only apply to sexuality either, it can reflect cases where a character comes out as having been a spy the entire time, or turns evil, or was evil and turns good, if a major shift occurs in how the character behaves that is not justified against their previous actions, then that is just bad writing."
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,56,Sat Jul 18 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"It doesn't bother me as long as it's not forced and the conflict makes for interesting character developement, unlike this whole ordeal where it felt a little like Bendis was pulling at straws for any kind of brief conflict to fill some space and then not explore it well."

He made a casual off-hand comment about Magik being hot and then young Jean Grey goes on a tangent to force him out of the closet. Which in honesty felt awkward as a reader as it was an unnatural developement when the situation could have been introduced much more delicately, if at all."
comicbooks,3dpxam,NotAMarvelHero,23,Sat Jul 18 09:17:17 2015 UTC,Why is Bendis still allowed to write team book?  I'm assuming it's Bendis because of the dialogue
comicbooks,3dpxam,ryanhadaway,16,Sat Jul 18 09:19:27 2015 UTC,It is Bendis and it's because his stuff sells.
comicbooks,3dpxam,CorruptedEvil,3,Sat Jul 18 09:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's Bendis and I'm a huge fan of his writing but sometimes I feel he thinks too much about the bigger picture that small things like this can sometimes slip through. Which I can perfectly understand from a writing standpoint and it can happen with anyone, especially when you throw pressure and deadlines into the mix."
comicbooks,3dpxam,NotAMarvelHero,5,Sat Jul 18 09:25:23 2015 UTC,I think my main problem with that page is you didn't even have to write in hints that he's gay you could have hints in the art like eye placement or something but it just came out of no where which is really dumb

comicbooks,3dpxam,Gnivil,10,Sat Jul 18 09:56:30 2015 UTC,"As you said, there was a lot of sexual tension, subtext and hints between Rictor and Shatterstar throughout X-Force and revealing their relationship in X-Factor was a natural progression. It might have seemed sudden due to both of them not appearing so much during the previous years and to readers who weren't familiar with them but I see it as a natural step in their character development.  Iceman's revelation came out of nowhere on the other hand. Suddenly we have Teen Jean saying, ""Hey Bobby, you're so totally gay right? I mean I can read minds and I just saw it"". This implies a lot of things that change his history as a character and gives the reader a bunch of questions.   ""What about all his girlfriends?"", ""Did the other psychics knew about this?"", ""Emma Frost must have known since she shared his body for a while, right?""  I didn't like Bobby's case because it was bad story telling, There weren't any hints or a build up for the reveal. His sexuality isn't the problem. But that's just my opinion. I can see how this change may make a character seem completely different to some readers but if it does bother you then you should check exactly what bothers you. Is it the bad story telling, his sexuality or how it changed his history? Not liking the change doesn't make you homophobic but it depends mostly on the reasons behind your opinion.

I agree with this as well, and I believe that having different version of heroes(like Miles Morales, or various Green Lanterns), or another version who replaces the last one(like the new Thor) is the key here. It's the perfect middleground between keeping the original continuity going, and also the resources needed when creating a new hero. Creating a new hero and turning it into a successful franchise is very resource-intensive, and this'd go especially for a gay character(which would most likely be ignored by the majority of fans.) So yeah, I'm all for replacements or different versions, but simply changing a character out of the blue, is just lazy in my opinion. Which doesn't mean that there couldn't be a ""coming out"" of some sort."
comicbooks,3dpxam,Calorie_Mate,28,Sat Jul 18 10:08:43 2015 UTC,Generally not no. I think most people would have the same reaction they did to the Iceman stuff if he was already gay and they made him straight.
comicbooks,3dpxam,CorruptedEvil,18,Sat Jul 18 08:33:56 2015 UTC,"(Disclaimer: I live in America so this is very America-centric. I don't know to what degree it generalizes.)  I think that it's clear from the overall volume of the reaction to various character changes/revelations and new people taking on superhero identities (characters very rarely actually literally change race in comics; I can think of only three examples, and all are fairly old and only one, Psylocke, is at all prominent) that there's certainly much more resistance to things like ""Character X, who is black, is the new Captain America"" than there is to things like ""Character Y, who is white, is the new Captain America.""  Does that mean that EVERYONE who doesn't like the idea of Falcon as Captain America or SPOILER as Thor or whatever feels that way because they're racist or sexist or whatever? No, but there's probably some of that. I bet that if you asked everyone who dislikes Falcon as Captain America if it's a race thing, virtually every single one of them would say no, it's not a race thing. But there's got to be something about Falcap that makes people so much angrier than Bucky-Cap, and it's just a basic fact about humans that we tend to be pretty poor at recognizing crummy racial attitudes in ourselves. Basically nobody thinks of themselves as racist, but there sure are a lot of really lousy racial opinions that fly around for a society where nobody thinks of themselves that way. It's ""I'm not racist, but..."" syndrome.  I think that there's also a tendency (among everybody) to think of the world as being made up of ""racists"" who hate people of different ethnicities with every fiber of their being and who are loudly and virulently discriminatory and vile, and ""not racists,"" who carry zero harmful racial attitudes and are somehow completely immune to cultural narratives about race. That's kind of a lazy way of thinking because it makes it super easy to just say ""Well, I'm not in the KKK or anything, so therefore I'm one of the not-racists"" and basically just excuse yourself from having to think about how latent racial attitudes that you (and basically everybody) carry affect how you react to things."

For him to still feel out of place in the modern era, after like 70 years of stories, seems incredibly boring, if they were STILL doing that, I have nothing but praise for them deciding to bring FalCap in, breathe some fresh life into the mantle.  Although at the same time, from what I've read of the Avengers and that recent Cap run, and other Marvel books he's appeared in, that wasn't really the case with Steve anymore anyway. He seemed like he'd adjusted to life in the 21st century."
comicbooks,3dpxam,090078601,10,Sat Jul 18 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"What I mean by ""a man out of time"" is not about Cap having trouble with smart phones or whatever , it's about a characther who represents the ideals of an age long passed being thrust into the more cynical modern era. Caps idealism is what is outdated about him and this what the driving force of the characther. It's why he Tony are always in conflict , because Steve embodies the idealism of past while living in the present while Tony is the modern idealist who believes in the future  but not the present. What made Bucky interesting is that he represented the shadowy side of the idealized time Cap represented."
comicbooks,3dpxam,mousedeath,5,Sat Jul 18 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Man out of Time is integral to Captain America, but I do think experience and respect is. Cap always has to be the most moral person in the room, the guy to give the speeches to rally the troops against the bad guys. He has to be impressive enough to make guys like Spider-Man tongue tied, and guys like Punisher docile.  Steve obviously fits the bill. Bucky was more of a stretch, but he did also fight in World War 2, and he learned from Cap for years. I also bought his prowess with the shield by way of his robot arm. And he was a soldier.   Falcon.... eh. He's always been a second stringer. He has no special powers besides flight and bird talking, so he can never be as good with the Shield. Not a soldier, just kind of a good guy who helped Steve out. When he tries to give speeches or command respect, I always think, ""why am I supposed to listen to you?"" I was hoping his series would answer that question, but it was steamrolled by Axis.  Ian Rogers would have made more sense as Cap. Raised by the man himself, led a rebellion against a dictatorial regime, come from an alternate universe so he's also a man out of time, and you'd get an interesting father-son dynamic from him being Cap. It's almost silly how perfect he would have been for the role. But sadly, the cynic in me realizes that he had one fatal flaw; he was another white man. Makes me wonder if Remender wanted Ian to replace Cap, but Marvel editorial wanted that extra bit of diversity."

I don't think either of those other characthers have the weight to them that Superman and Cap have and because the iconic nature of characthers being such a large part of that . I don't think it's possible to replicate. People bring up Dickbats but Dick himself is one of the most iconic figures in comics and his ascension to Batman was built up over 70 years. I don't think Ian or Sam can really fill in for Cap."

Same thing with Thor, I don't care for Thor personally (I think he's lame), but I can get why older readers would be upset with the new Thor because the title changed into something quite different from what they had been following before.

There's very little about Kamala that actually ties to Captain Marvel; Kamala looks up to Carol and the fact that she's a big fan of superheroes is important to her character, but the fact that she names herself Ms. Marvel is pretty incidental. The important reason that she's called Ms. Marvel is an out-of-universe one - humans pay way more attention to books that have at least nominal connections to stuff they already know. Would Kamala have had the same success if the story was exactly the same, except that she'd chosen a non-derivative name for her secret identity? Possibly, but it would have made the series a much bigger risk."

Honestly I'm happy with what marvels been doing with the legacy hero stuff, there's been some missteps but I think it's been a good change of pace.

comicbooks,3dpxam,HollowPrint,3,Sun Jul 19 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"A black Captain America is an interesting idea, and was explored really well in Truth: Red, White, & Black.  That series also drew its own set of criticism, some of which may have been racially motivated.  However, I think it's unfair to label all criticism as race / sex motivated.  As we saw when Doc Ock took over the mind of Spider-Man, sometimes people just don't like it when characters are fundamentally changed, which is how some people saw that aforementioned series.  Much like the SpOck (Spider-Ock) run, many people changed their minds over the course of the series.  My own issue with Falcon is that he's just the Falcon with a patriotic paint job and a shield.  Kind of like when characters get the power cosmic, it's like Falcon just got 'the power Captain.'  I would probably find it as silly as if Hawkeye was suddenly Captain America, while still running around with his same costume in patriotic colors, shooting the shield with this bow.  That's the thing though—I just find it silly.  I'm not offended or anything, but that's probably because I'm not a huge fan of the comics except for exceptional runs like Brubaker's."

The obvious reason here is because, in the current comic book climate, new, original, big two characters don't sell books and almost never stick around more than a year or so. They just can't compete for popularity against characters that have been building their fanbases for 50 or 60 years. I remember a discussion about recent characters that were successful enough to stick around, and the latest examples people were coming up with were mainly Deadpool and Harley Quinn, who are both over 20 years old now. The Runaways were thrown around as an example, but I would argue that they kind of disappeared for a good long while before a few of them popped back up in things like Avengers Arena. Even then they're one of the incredibly tiny percentage of new characters that's able to stick around in any capacity whatsoever.  Tl;dr: The reason people are trying to add diversity to comic books through preexisting characters is because in this day and age, creating a new character is like throwing ideas into a void that no one will see or remember. Whether it's a good or bad solution is a debate I'm not sure I'm qualified to engage in, but that's the reason it happens."

Marvel & DC are happy to churn out crap now that they have the Holywood money to rely on & the creators of the comics know that anything they create will be owned by the company so why bother pitching your good ideas when you have no larger fiscal investment in their success.  Gone are the days when comic creators became comic creators because they wanted to make comics, now its all about the tie in product dollars & royalties, regardless of if you are a creator, or represent the company.  What we really need is a third company to come along, with some new ideas & some real fiscal backing to come along & shake things up like what Marvel did to DC back in the day.

I think there are so many good characters that they could focus on that they havent yet used. I mean why create new characters when they can focus on underrated characters that already exist. That was what I really loved about 52 when DC did that a few years back. It really focused on characters that had never had a huge spotlight. Even more recently with multiversity we got to have a glimpse at completely new characters.

I wholeheartedly agree that new characters would be ideal but in today's market it's completely unfeasible.  The closest to a new mainstream character in the 2000s has been Invincible.

But with a reboot, such as Alan Scott in the new 52 it has no effect on the previous version of the character, you can treat him as a whole different guy just with a different name. in this case getting mad at him because he is now gay is stupid, you can be mad that the character you like is not being written any more but being mad that this new character is gay just because the old one wasn't is a bad thing."

Played, talked, hung out, shared fandoms, were generally good friends with each other. We also talked about girls and  that stuff openly. As I'm sure close family members do.   Time passes, we grow up, grow apart, that sorta thing. After some time, Facebook inevitably puts you back in contact with a lot of people. My family member being one of them. In between that time he had evidently realized he was gay and came out as such. Now me just having known our past was slightly shocked but nonetheless accepting of his choice or realization. I've grown to be very happy for him as all I want for my family is to have prosperity. And not only that, but I accept who he is and everyone for that matter.   I look at it like this,try turning it into a positive. It adds to his character.

I am friends with two women and a man who didn't have homosexual relationships until their late 20's and 30's.   Two of them were married (not to each other).  I am also acquaintances with a woman who considered herself exclusively lesbian who is now dating a trans man.  I considered myself heterosexual for a long time but I find myself increasingly attracted to women and open to the possibilities.  I guess what I am trying to say is that sexuality is complicated.

With Iceman, the jury is still mostly out, because we haven't really seen that story's development (though I think Bendis left way too many holes to be poked at in his story, so far).  I do feel it's often lazy to go down that road, though. I prefer seeing new characters that are LGBT, as it requires more effort to pull it off right, than simply retconning someone's  sexuality. And even then, the creator often has no other options, like Robinson in Earth 2, where he just had to change the sexuality of GL and the race of Hawkwoman to have diversity in that comic."
comicbooks,3dpxam,PROMITHEUS89,2,Sat Jul 18 21:11:48 2015 UTC,Is it homophobic for someone to be mad at a character being turned gay?   No more than it would be heterophobic for one to be mad if DC announced today that Batwoman was going to become a raging heterosexual.
comicbooks,3dpxam,matthew_lane,2,Sat Jul 18 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"generally yes it is homophobic. The characters change so drastically in so many different ways.  Be it time travel, mutations, equipment, team allegence, to just simply having a writer change the personality completely for their run.  Sexuality is just always the one that people latch on to as changing the character too much, with people jumping through hoop after hoop to prove why it just cant be so.  The Stan Lee quote everyone keeps repeating seems sorta silly to me as well.  I mean... if you're going down that path,  then why change anything about any character?  Why redesign an outfit when you can just make a new one, right?"

Sexuality is just always the one that people latch on to as changing the character too much, with people jumping through hoop after hoop to prove why it just cant be so.   That's sort of a different argument though, ""why can you believe that a man can fly, but not that he can '[blank]?'"" Well the reason is that when reading sueprhero/scifi/fantasy, you have to suspend disbelief as to the laws of physics, but in good genre fiction you should never have to suspend disbelief about human behavior.   The physical capabilities of the characters are obviously not realistic, but their personalities always should be. Characters should behave like real people who just happen to be living in a strange world. If a character takes a wild personality swing, there should be some plausible explanation for why that swing occurred, it should not ""just happen."""
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"well thats partly my point.  It does ""just happen"" so often in fact that people accept if as normal.  The top post on this very sub for a while was just showing how many different Jokers there were.  I bet you anything if one of those Jokers was gay, people would bring up how its ""not part of his character"" when the only thing they have in common otherwise is their color scheme."
comicbooks,3dpxam,yokmsdfjs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:30:23 2015 UTC,"I could accept a gay Joker easily enough, because part of the Joker's character IS his wildly erratic nature. In fact, it's been strongly implied at several points that Batman is the love of Joker's life. I don't think it's a strong argument though to say that because an erratic psychopath might suddenly be gay, it would justify that sort of major life shift in any other character."
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:45:25 2015 UTC,"I guess bad example (just used it because of how recent the post was)   I dont see it as too much of a stretch for a character to come out later in their creation though.  Ive known a few people who came out in their late 20s and heard stories of many not coming out until much much later on.  Yes, these are major life shifts that do happen to people in real life.  In fact I almost feel like a major character coming out is part of the point.  As that would be far more relateable and impactful and useful to readers, for someone you've known all these years to come out rather than some flash-in-the-pan character that will be forgotten by the end of the next ""event""."
comicbooks,3dpxam,yokmsdfjs,3,Sun Jul 19 09:17:01 2015 UTC,"I guess bad example (just used it because of how recent the post was) I dont see it as too much of a stretch for a character to come out later in their creation though. Ive known a few people who came out in their late 20s and heard stories of many not coming out until much much later on.   Again, context is everything. Northstar came out, what, twenty some years after his creation, and most comic fans are totally fine with that. If a character has a history where coming out works for them, then time is not a factor. And bisexuality is much easier than single homosexuality, because if a character is established as having several passionate romances with the opposite sex, and then is established to also form a passionate romance with a same sex partner, then that might be plausible, but for them to establish that they do not love women at all, then what were the previous romances, lies? That can be seen as a betrayal of the trust fans put in those stories.   And again, we run into issues with the difference between real life people and fictional people, because with real life people, they have an inner life we are not privy to. They might seem very macho and woman-chasing on the outside, but inside pine after guys, but in a comic, you see their inner life as well, they actively think, without deception, that female characters are attractive to them in a sexual manner, so to then say that they have no actual interest is implausible. So factors that are important to consider when ""outing"" a character (let's stick to male for the purposes of this discussion to reduce pronoun confusion, but all genders could be swapped):   Has he had one or more serious romances with a woman? Has the reader been privy to his inner monologue in regards to his feelings about this woman?  Has he ever shown any outward interest in men? Has he ever expressed any interior interest in men, particularly when exposed to sexually suggestive situations, or been outright propositioned by another male character? How has he interacted with other ""out"" LGBT characters in the past?  How have telepaths reacted to being present in his mind?    See, the whole Iceman situation bothers be because, in my opinion, it fails on numerous cases here. In his case, he has had numerous serious relationships with women, ones in which he has expressed within his own mind how much he cared about them. Were all these relationships nothing more than an elaborate ruse? Were they just ""strong friendships"" that also included sex? I'm aware that closeted gay men do marry women, but one does not usually have access to their inner thoughts as they do so.    He has never shown any interest in male characters, even when one of his girlfriends turned out to have a physically male side (which I would think would be a win/win scenario for a closeted gay man), or when propositioned by Northstar (not that he would have to accept those advances, but they should have given him at least a little pause). This is true both overly, in the way that one person might notice another person being interested, but also internally, from inner monologues the reader was privy to.   He's also shown no indication that he was gay to any one of his several LGBT friends, even in cases where his support might have been helpful to them (such as helping young Anole deal with his own coming out).   He's had numerous telepaths in his mind over the years, some friends, some enemies, Emma Frost even rode him for a while, and yet not one has seen fit to address what I think would be a fairly obvious character trait, while many female telepaths have commented that he was entertaining ""dirty thoughts"" towards them. I'm not saying they should have been as blunt about it as Jean was, but you'd think if he had that conflict inside him, and particularly during periods in which he was displaying overt signs of depression, they would have tried to therapeutically approach the issue. If any of these telepathic X-Men did find out that he was gay, and chose not to address it to him, shouldn't they have at least said something to the various women he was dating, to save them from the deception?   Ultimately, it's barely plausible that he would have any interest in men at all, much less that he would have no actual interest in women. Even if that alone were plausible, I would have much less respect for him as a character, for hiding this part of himself, when it could have done so much more good for those around him if he'd been out about it from early on. Iceman being gay would be nothing to be ashamed of, but Iceman being ashamed to be out for all these years would be.  As for the popularity of the gay character in question, that's up to the fans. If the fans want the character to remain relevant, then the character will remain relevant. It shouldn't be for Marvel or DC to convert an existing major character just to ensure that he stays active. If the fans keep demanding that a character remain on the front lines, then he will remain on the front lines."
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:56:10 2015 UTC,"First off, great post.    I think Im going to have to bow out though as I don't have the character knowledge to agree or disagree with most of your points.   All I can really say is that as someone who follows just a handful of superhero books at a time, and usually only for specific runs.  Im a good bit less married to ""cannon"" than many.  Possibly Im too casual to even be sticking my head in but with all the things to get hung up on when it comes to a characters overall arc, sexuality seems like a really weird thing to latch on to as  ""too far, they ruined this character""... Especially to the point of anger.  As a more casual comic fan it comes off as very homophobic, and its not a good look."
comicbooks,3dpxam,yokmsdfjs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"I to fair, I get hung up on a lot of things as ""ruining the character,"" and sexuality, if it is an issue at all, is not always a larger one than others. I think if you do a purely out of continuity iteration of a character, like say a movie version, there is more flexibility to work with, but when your character is inside an established canon, you owe it to all that has come before and will come after to be a good steward to that character, to respect all the work that's gone into him so far, and to respect that others will want to make use of the character when you're gone. Take only pictures, leave only footprints."
comicbooks,3dpxam,ohoni,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:46:43 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. But we are unable to have access to their motivations (and people who are very homophobic are often not going to disclose that).   However, we do have something we can use: analogy. We can look at when characters have changed and whether there was equivalent outrage. That gives us a hint that, for people who are bigots, even fictionalized homosexuality offends them. When someone gives me a complicated argument as to why they seem homophobic but they're not really homophobic, it's not me they want to convince."
comicbooks,3dpxam,Not_A_Doctor__,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:58:22 2015 UTC,I don't think it's homophobic at all to be angry when a writer completely overrides all the years of character portrayals and development just for the sake of diversity or making headlines.

Just assume they are straight, gay, pan, closeted or whatever you want unless stated otherwise."

I read the entire run of Ultimate Spider-Man and started Amazing Spider-Man which has every issue.  But some series, like Web of Spider-Man, are missing issues.  I do not mind waiting six months for new issues, I just cannot stand that older ones are missing.

comicbooks,3dpn3y,Inkeydoo,3,Sat Jul 18 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"For Manga I'd suggest giving Berserk and One Piece try. I think they represent the best of their respective genres and have the benefit of not being too Japanese (what I mean is a lot of Manga requires a working knowledge of Japanese culture to really understand and most non Japanese people don't have that). One Piece is your standard action/adventure Manga but it's the best of the lot. It's really funny and has a lot cool powers and actions  while at the same time having a remarkable depth of world building(the consistancy of the powerscaling throughout the 700+ chapters of the series is just beautiful to behold)and can get surprisingly emotional (without getting annoying). Berserk is a brutally dark  manga with a lot of horror, sex , and ultra violence but it's a really extraordinary story. It's a bit like Game of Thrones in terms of setting and atmosphere. Also features one of the most badass protoganists in fiction."

comicbooks,3ds06i,ASRNLD,6,Sat Jul 18 22:07:15 2015 UTC,"Well there are two different types of volumes. The first is to essentially differentiate each series. So to try and keep it simple; essentially each time it starts out at #1 it is a new volume. So the first time a title has a #1 that is volume one and if the series gets cancelled, renumbered, rebooted or whatever causes it to have a new #1 then that will be volume 2. Then if for whatever reason that one ends and they start it up at #1 again then it would be volume 3 and so forth. Then there are volumes for trades so New 52 Batman volume 1 will be 1-6 and then New 52 batman volume 2 will be 7-12 and so forth."
comicbooks,3ds06i,DementiaPrime,2,Sat Jul 18 22:21:53 2015 UTC,"I never thought it about it before, but maybe this issue is partly why Marvel has been adding the weird ""All-New"" etc. when it relaunches a book. That way, instead of having Avengers Vol. 35, you can have All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol. 1. Aside from the obvious marketing ploy, that is.     It definitely would have been somewhat less labyrinthine when I first started reading. Telling a new reader that they need to pick up Vol. 1 of Uncanny X-men Vol. 3 is just asking for misunderstanding."

comicbooks,3dmjj5,Kaiosama,3,Fri Jul 17 14:58:08 2015 UTC,Deathstroke is a real badass of a villian.  Except the time Ollie owned him.  But the whole arc with Jericho and Terra is one of my all-time favorites.

comicbooks,3dmjj5,TheIncredible_BatCow,6,Fri Jul 17 21:24:42 2015 UTC,"I almost hate to use a team, because it's kinda cheating, but the Justice League.   Amazo - the unpredictability is built into the character. Are you getting an older Amazo model that copies the powers of the original team or a new model that adapts to the powers of its current enemies? Is it semi-autonomous or being used as a weapon for somebody else? Whatever the case, pack a lunch because Amazo is tough to beat.   Darkseid - Darkseid is.   The Crime Syndicate - Mirror/Mirror villains. Classic. I loved the (I think it was Busiek's) story that established that they really don't have much free will and are stuck as the reflection of New Earth, to the point their Power Ring blinked out of existence and was replaced with a black Power Ring because John Stewart was the active JL GL.   The Injustice Gang - Morrison and McDuffie both had great takes on the group over the past couple decades - one with a roster that mirrored the team's members with their most notable archenemies and another with a gigantic team that just tried to beat the League with sheer numbers, and both were fun to see the League have to deal with. Morrison having Batman buy Mirror Master's allegiance with a donation to an orphanage particularly stands out to me."
comicbooks,3dmjj5,QuirkyGroundhog,11,Fri Jul 17 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"I concur with your assessment on FF. I would also say the X-Men, they have a varied and colorful rogues gallery from Silver Age classics to otherworldly cosmic entities and space empires. When you take into account that the government itself is sometimes the mutant's enemies and then you remember the hellfire club and all the other scheming mutants, it's really a great group of villains."
comicbooks,3dmjj5,TheIncredible_BatCow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:17:16 2015 UTC,Exactly I can't believe op mentioned FF but didn't discuss The Frightful Four and their constant face offs in the Silver Age.

comicbooks,3dmjj5,TheIncredible_BatCow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"No worries, I mean many of the members of that group usually were other characters' enemies and not tied to one group. Hydro Man, Sandman, etc usually get associated with Spidey before FF."
comicbooks,3dmjj5,usabfb,17,Fri Jul 17 18:56:52 2015 UTC,Daredevil and Dr. Strange have pretty solid rogues galleries. They're at least in the top ten.
comicbooks,3dmjj5,gibbey,14,Fri Jul 17 15:33:05 2015 UTC,I think Daredevil is one of the few characters at the big two who still get cool new villains (that probably because of Waid though). Maybe Batman.
comicbooks,3dmjj5,ClydeFrawg,9,Fri Jul 17 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"Batman does get a couple new, good villains. Hush was only in 2002, which sounds like a long time, but really for a popular character it's hard to get new villains. Then there was the Court Of Owls and the somewhat similar Black Glove. We will see how 'Mr. Bloom' goes."
comicbooks,3dmjj5,Hifiloguy,6,Fri Jul 17 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"For me the Court of Owls was the most successful. I wish more writers tried to create new cool villains but I think it'd lead to weird fan blacklash by ignoring the favourites. Like Mr. Negative's really awesome for instance, great design, great hook."
comicbooks,3dmjj5,PLZ__DONT__PM__ME,7,Fri Jul 17 19:09:20 2015 UTC,I think Pyg'll last.

comicbooks,3dmjj5,Draculasaurus_Rex,5,Sat Jul 18 03:55:15 2015 UTC,"I've never understood why people claim that Snyder stole from Morrison with the Court of Owls (not that that's what you're saying). How are the Black Glove and Court of Owls similar? They're both secret societies? The Black Glove wasn't even much of a society, it was just a group of supervillains, right? It's been a while since I last read that arc. Their whole purpose was also the destruction of Batman, while the Court of Owls' was not. They're fundamentally different."
comicbooks,3dmjj5,Hifiloguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:14:52 2015 UTC,I never said Snyder 'stole' from Morrison. I didn't even know it was a thing to bash on Snyder like that. I'm just saying they are similar as in secret groups somewhat against Batman.
comicbooks,3dmjj5,Interesting_fox,2,Sat Jul 18 03:54:02 2015 UTC,"Again, as I said above, I didn't say that you were saying Snyder stole the idea from Morrison. Your comment about their similarity simply reminded me of when I used to see people all over this sub (more than a year ago at this point) claiming that Court of Owls was essentially a direct copy of The Black Glove, which I never agreed with. I can see their very basic similarity, but that's where I think any comparisons between the two end."
comicbooks,3dmjj5,usabfb,5,Sat Jul 18 03:58:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. Bullseye is probably my favorite villain. Kingpin is great also.
comicbooks,3dmjj5,sesimie,2,Fri Jul 17 17:29:15 2015 UTC,Punisher MAX Bullseye is my favorite.
comicbooks,3dmjj5,mtm5891,3,Fri Jul 17 18:50:02 2015 UTC,Not even close. Can you even name ten of each that your average welterweight comics fan would know? I'm reasonably hardcore and I couldn't name 10 Daredevil villains without going into losers like the Matador or C-list fodder villains like Tarantula.

comicbooks,3dmjj5,wisesonAC,2,Fri Jul 17 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think how well known a rogues gallery is reflects its quality. I would argue both of them have lineups of some pretty great villains, even if most people haven't read their stories. That doesn't somehow make the stories bad."

He has, what is to me, the most compelling, amoral sometimes-villain in comics (the Shade) as a tentative ally.  He finds himself facing some of the enemies of all the other heroes who have called themselves Starman, and before you assume all this ""retreading"" is lazy, let me say that his running this Golden and Silver Age gauntlet is only part of his story, and it weaves together DC history in very interesting and unique ways.  Nobody's story is like this Starman's, and yet, you can become well-acquainted with the DC universe just by reading him.  The enemies he earns on his own are pretty fantastic, too.  The succubus carnival owner comes to mind."

comicbooks,3dmjj5,TheRedBee,5,Sat Jul 18 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"In a vacuum, X-Men has the best villains in comics. They are largely based on some sort of warped sense of righting a certain wrong or promoting some type of agenda that could possibly be seen as noble. There are some purely evil villains in the X-Universe, but they aren't the norm. What makes this compelling is the fact that many members of the X-Men (and the reader) can easily sympathize or relate to the cause of a lot of the X-Villains.   However, all of this hinges on writing. Magneto can be the best or worst villain ever, depending on the writer. Same goes for The Joker or Doctor Octopus."

comicbooks,3dq48j,Mycahhh,5,Sat Jul 18 10:21:09 2015 UTC,sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. sometimes it takes place in an entirely separate universe like injustice and sometime it is only loosely connected like the current Justice league.  The best way I would advise you go about it is take everything as it comes to you. if you find something in conflict with what you know then you go forward with the new information.
comicbooks,3dq48j,harryboom,2,Sat Jul 18 10:25:54 2015 UTC,"Context is key. Many stories can take place in their own internal pocket of story, like Injustice. Injustice is a possible take on the future of DC characters.  Most DC or Marvel books circle around a central relaxed continiuity allowing a shared universe that's somewhat consistent.  It's a ton of work and not uncommon for stories to be ""retconned"" (retroactively changed) to keep things fresh and accessible."
comicbooks,3dq48j,Crash_Recovery,2,Sat Jul 18 12:20:10 2015 UTC,"it depends. DC reset everything every 15 years or so. The fundamentals stay the same (superman wears blue, comes from krypton, batman is an orphan with a flying rodent fetish and so on) but details change (ma and pa kent may or may not be alive, the number of green lanterns is highly variable)  Marvel simply amass an improbable amount of continuity and backstory that you just have to ignore because there's no hope of ever catching up with it all. Although, they do seem to be doing a bit of a reset with the new secret wars.  Then there's all the alternate realities, marvel have the ultimates universe and the future 2099 universe, DC have Earth 2 and there's a trend for series in specific alternate universes, like Old man logan, smallville, batman 66, not to mention all the elseworlds and what ifs, most of which are one shots but sometimes they hang about for a miniseries.  In short, don't sweat it. If you can deal with the concept of michael keaton, christian bale and adam west being batman, then you're grand."

comicbooks,3dq48j,centipededamascus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"It's hard to keep track of the universes because of the way that they are publicized. On the one hand, since series typically run weekly or monthly, if you say miss a year then you'll be super confused. On the other hand, the status quo is also always pushing back in some way (there will almost always be an avengers, an x-men, a justice league, a flash/batman/superman/cap/whoever)   The hardest part is the fact that because of the release of comics, and the amount, it's practically impossible to read comics in chronological order. A week can be a pretty big timespan for a comic, and for the most part you take at face value that all new stories happened within the borders of 'recently' with exceptions usually being publicized.   The easiest way i find to keep track of stuff is that for the most part, characters will retain their status quo when written by specific authors, as big changes usually occur with a change in creative team (and if not, are usually advertised hard)  As well as acknowledging that the most errors will come with team books, as the lack of focus on just one person means there's a much larger timescale it could be happening in (also helps to justify possible continuity errors)   For the most part it's best to just go with the flow. Characters will always be a bit different depending on who writes them, and occasionally some writers may just miss something, as they're not perfect (unlike some users expect them to be) I'd just sit back and not think too hard about continuity, otherwise your head might explode :)"
comicbooks,3dq48j,Alistair3900,0,Sun Jul 19 07:53:05 2015 UTC,"Writers and editors will write a story for a particular series in a set universe. Usually separated by the companies they work for. Some companies will out right tell you that this current series takes place a different universe (WhatIfs, Elseworlds, Exiles and so on) - these books that are explicit that they do not have ties to set universe. What you do and don't take into account is on you unless the writer say otherwise. For example if you ready 20 issues back that 'Monkey Man' was turned into a vampire for 3 issues and now the writer says that did not happen to our 'Monkey Man' but an alternate universe version of our beloved banana slinging hero. This is referred to as a RETCON and this will happen a lot in the two major companies like Marvel and DC. You can call BS on it but in the end the Writer and Editor will tell you what did and did not take place in the universes for the most there is nothing set in stone."

comicbooks,3dplm3,CorruptedEvil,5,Sat Jul 18 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty sizable collection of paperbacks and as long as you are not destroying them it shouldn't really matter. Will a hardback last longer, sure. But what does that really mean? I have mine sitting on a shelf on display and its not like they are rotting away with their flimsy paper covers. Just take care of them like you would any other book and it really wont matter.    As far as I know there are no collectors that are actively seeking a TPB.  Basically what I'm saying is that if you are buying these in the hopes that they will increase in value like a floppy you are going to have a bad time. If, like me, you would rather read story arcs in one book and not have to go track down #34 or this or #7 of that, they just take care of you books soft or hard cover and you will be good to go."
comicbooks,3dplm3,fattzilla,2,Sat Jul 18 05:58:46 2015 UTC,do you think buying hardcover warrants the extra price? say if you had the choice of both which would you go for? As I found the long halloween online but it's 10 dollars more so should I just buy that and hold out for another hardcover with my voucher? I have no intention of selling these in the future but would be something I would like to hand down to my kids say 20-30 years from now
comicbooks,3dplm3,fattzilla,3,Sat Jul 18 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, but to each their own.    In my opinion you should go back and get that copy of The Long Halloween and read that shit ASAP, definitely one of the best Batman stories around.   I will pick up hardcovers if they are like the DMZ where I can get the entire story in 5 books as opposed to the 10 paperbacks.  But, I did get the Y:TLM in the 10 paperbacks because they were considerably cheaper (I got them on sale).    I guess basically what I'm saying is if you have the money and you really want the HC, get it. If you are interested in reading the stories and you can take care of them, get the paperbacks."
comicbooks,3dplm3,DoctorDoomDoom,3,Sat Jul 18 07:08:58 2015 UTC,"As others have said, taking care of a paperback can bring longevity to a collection too. It can be meaningful either way.   I personally hedge my bets when it comes to TPB/HC, meaning if it's currently ongoing, I'll read issues digitally and decide from there if I want to double dip on the series, and then, if I want to dish out for the HCs. My decision then always comes from how much I enjoy the series. For example, I've intentionally waited for Marvel to keep releasing hardcover collections of Waid and Samnee's Daredevil because it's absolutely stunning and I want to display it right up front. On the flip side, I just get the TBPs of Amazing Spider-Man because I enjoy it, but it doesn't need prominence on my shelf. So for future reference, buying HCs is easiest immediately after the initial run is collected.   For the older books, many hardcovers are out of print or in expensive Absolute Editions. That's when you dig into online shops, trustworthy eBay sellers, larger LCSs. I'm not sure about The Long Halloween, but I only own it in TBP, and I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't being printed in HC anymore, thus your difficulties. It is being printed in an Absolute Edition, I believe, and those are gorgeous. I would only shell out for one of those if it was a stunning book. (The Long Halloween is definitely good enough for that.) So if you're looking for a plain HC printing, good luck. If you find it, it'll probably be marked up.   Collecting hardcovers is hard because unless you want to collect current series, you can be left to the whims of the publication schedule. Besides, I personally enjoy the aesthetic of the current TPB print of The Long Halloween. The cover is soft and presented tastefully. The spine is easy to handle and doesn't make the book unruly. It's a great looking TPB for a collector, and I don't think you lose anything by not having a HC/Absolute printing."
comicbooks,3dplm3,DoctorDoomDoom,2,Sat Jul 18 06:52:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. The Long halloween is 13 issues and I found a new hardcover for $48 so $14 more then the TPB copy I paid for from that store that I have the voucher for so I might shell out the extra $14 for the hardcover version. A jump in $14 for a 13 issue novel for the hardcover seems worth it but like I said just starting collecting and know next to nothing about it.
comicbooks,3dplm3,Legion564,2,Sat Jul 18 07:19:58 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty great deal IMO. A year or so ago, I was trying to collect some Ultimate Spider-Man HCs, and got stuck on volume 8 or 9, don't remember. It was long out of print, and so rare that the normally $30ish volume was being marked up to +$100. I gave up and sold what I had collected at a profit.   For $14 more, assuming it's in good quality (no tears, good spine, any qualities you would expect of a book you might find in a LCS), it's a great deal.   To break it down, 13 issues at the current standard of $4 a piece would normally come out to be $52 total, so I would jump on that if I were you.   There's something very attractive about acquiring out of print volumes at a great price with great quality. I've done it a few times, and it's nice to brag to your friends about owning a nice, rare volume."
comicbooks,3dplm3,thegraaayghost,2,Sat Jul 18 16:19:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I was breaking it down at $4 a piece way of thinking and it does seem like i'm getting a good deal especially given it's HC

comicbooks,3dplm3,Legion564,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:05:18 2015 UTC,"SO I just started buying comics or graphic novels and i've been told hardcover's are the way to go.    Not particularly. When it comes to format there is some level of snobbery still in existence. Back in the early history of the moveable type printing press hardcover books were considered ""real"" books for wealthy patrons & the softcovers where for those work-a-day common folk & were put together poorly.  However these days, the workmanship on softcovers is equal to those of hardcover, if not greater. They bend easily, so they also bend back in to shape easier. The binding is mostly up to standard with a few notable exceptions & will likely last longer than a sewn spine will in a hardcover. Both kinds of spines are relatively easy to have repaired these days at a bindery if they do get damaged or worn.  Though hardcovers with dust jackets (a rarity these days) do have significant issues with tearing & general wear and tear, even if you use library grade covers.  So the idea that hardcovers last longer is no longer true: A softcover if treated well is likely to last just as long as a hard cover, especially if kept in a polybag & kept out of direct harsh sun light.  As for softcover versus hardcover, I will say this: Books are more likely to have a softcover release, where as they won't always have a hardcover release, especially if they are only of only limited appeal.  The exception to the rule being the earth one series from DC which always comes out in hardcover much earlier than softcover: But that is the exception that proves the rule.  In the end when you pay for a hardcover you are pretty much paying a premium to say that you own a hardcover, that's about it in real terms. My collection is growing pretty fast & I only have three hardcovers in my collection, one of which I'm about ready to swap out for a softcover version of the same book.  So at the end of the day, for every four hardcovers you can buy, I can buy five to seven softcovers. An really that's the only advantage one format has over the other."

If treated well both a hardcover & a softcover will last the same amount of time without damage.   Same with the binding: Contemporary trades have very little in the way of gutter loss regardless of binding type (smythe sewn or overbindding), or the soft covers preferred glued format (ultra-binding).  As for going out of stock faster that's not really an advantage if one is looking to collect as a reader rather than a speculative investor."

comicbooks,3dnvhu,CorruptedEvil,3,Fri Jul 17 21:27:03 2015 UTC,Island is really good. Definitely worth picking up. More literary comics!
comicbooks,3dnvhu,deviden,2,Sat Jul 18 06:49:11 2015 UTC,"Island was easily the best thing I picked up last week.   It really feels like a magazine made by artists' rather than writers, with Emma Rios, Brandon Graham and Ludroe each bringing their extremely distinct styles and voices. More Multiple Warheads is always a joy, Rios is always incredible and it's interesting to see her produce a solo sci-fi comic (in red ink, which looks fantastic with her line), and Ludroe's style in his skater-superhero story is like a fusion of urban graffiti with punchy Kirby-esque perspective. It's all top notch stuff.  If you're worried about the cost, think of it like this: for the price of two 20 page Marvel comics you're getting three 20-30 page comics, a magazine article and several art pages. It's probably the best value buy in monthly American comics.  I'm already excited to see what comes next month."

comicbooks,3docjv,pancakeshavings,13,Fri Jul 17 22:28:20 2015 UTC,"Probably the best run of 100 consecutive issues the JL concept ever had. The quality drops a bit from Morrison to Waid and then from Waid to Kelly, but it's still a decent read at its worst.   At its best it's one of the most insane and action packed comics you can find from the main DC imprint. You have Superman wrestling angels, invasions from the 5th dimension Batman's plans to take down the JLA. And none of those would even be in my top 10 best moments."
comicbooks,3docjv,PROMITHEUS89,5,Fri Jul 17 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"I think Waid maintained the quality pretty damn well. It had more character analysis work. Tower of Babel and Divided We Fall are amazing stories.  What I remember of Kelly's stuff was OK, but it started getting really weird and further away from the core concept. I eventually tuned out."
comicbooks,3docjv,Earthpig_Johnson,3,Sat Jul 18 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"Waid's run had a pretty good quality average, but I was talking about its truncated lenght.  If you don't know the story, it goes like this: after the Authority, Hitch was immediately put on JLA with Waid. The plan was for him to do the Heaven's Ladder oversized GN right after Authority, take a couple of months to rest and then jump into the main title. However, someone at DC's editorial fucked up, and not only was his GN solicited too early but his start on JLA was solicited for the same month. He was working on his first issue while still finishing up Heaven's Ladder and stayed behind schedule for the whole run, constantly under pressure (that's why so many of his issues have other artists). When Marvel showed up, offering him The Ultimates, he was more than happy to leave for a better wage and a sensible deadline (that he'd end up breaking). After this happened, Waid, who already wasn't particularly happy at DC after the whole Superman Now mess, just decided to leave the title in solidarity to Hitch. The interesting thing about the whole incident is that it might have been the thing that ""broke"" Hitch.   He was the big new superstar artist, the first of the new millenium, and unlike his immediate predecessors (Lee, Madureira, etc.) he could handle a monthly deadline, until JLA ...  Basically, we could have had years of Waid and Hitch on JLA, if someone hadn't fucked up the schedules ..."
comicbooks,3docjv,PROMITHEUS89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:13:56 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I didn't know anything about that story. I always figured Hitch just takes a long time drawing because, shit, look at how well that guy can draw when he wants to. I'm more than happy dealing with delays from an artist if it means the finished product gets to be consistent and good looking.  It's depressing to know that there could have been so much more from that fantastic team, though. If Waid has any more unused ideas for JLA, he should come on board and write a few arcs with Hitch on the new series."
comicbooks,3docjv,Earthpig_Johnson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:14:48 2015 UTC,"Hitch was actually a fairly fast artist up until that point. He might have drawn as many pages from between the start of his Stormwatch run and the end of his stay at JLA as he has since. He probably hit his peak, in terms of detail vs deadlines, in Heaven's Ladder, and I'd imagine that it was his time on JLA plus Marvel's leniency that ultimately led to his current status as a ""slow artist"".  Waid won't work for DC for as long as Didio and Harras are there. He hates their guts with a passion, though for different reasons."
comicbooks,3docjv,PROMITHEUS89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"Damn, I didn't know that either. That really sucks, since pretty much everything Waid writes is solid."

comicbooks,3docjv,PROMITHEUS89,0,Sat Jul 18 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"I preffered Waid's writing in a lot of cases, personally. It didn't just come down to Batman always saving the day and other heroes kind of got to have their time in the sun.  I really enjoyed Morrison's run before the Electric Blue Superman came around and it felt like Morrison didn't really want to write him.  Granted it's been awhile and that run is dense, but those are my feelings.  Edit: Seems my memory about JLA is shot. Guess I know what I am re-reading next."

comicbooks,3docjv,ian_stein,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"I purchased the collected paperbacks last year, own 1-5, collects Morrison and Waid's runs.   This series is Morrison really coming into his own. My favorite work of his is his New X-Men run, then Final Crisis, and JLA comes next. Some incredible writing, massive scale, dense plot and dialogue.   Unfortunately, it's been a while since I've read them, so there isn't much I can say to the content of it, but I absolutely recommend getting volumes 1-5, new paperback printings."
comicbooks,3docjv,DoctorDoomDoom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:33:46 2015 UTC,"Morrison's run is kind of spellbinding from beginning to end. Mark Waid is Mark Waid, and his arc has ""Tower of Babel"" - which is a really famous, Batman-centric JLA story for reasons I won't go into if you've never heard of it before. ""Secret Identities"" is another arc that starts right around #50, where each Justice League member splits into two people - the hero and the secret identity - that is also really great.   Kelly's run is pretty mediocre I've always thought. John Byrne and Chris Claremont also teamed up for a run right around 100, maybe 5 or 10 issues or so, that you should run away from at all costs. Seriously, it's so awful."
comicbooks,3docjv,MattAlbie60,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:49:37 2015 UTC,"I'd forgotten there were those arcs by various creative teams in the middle of Kelly's run. There was some decent stuff in there (I remember enjoying Busiek's story with Ron Garney), but it was an effective way to kill their best seller, I'll give DC that.  Kelly focused too much on soap opera and character interaction for a JLA, I feel, but still had some nice JLA moments. Waid's run could have been something truly special, if DC hadn't fucked up Hitch's schedule so bad."

comicbooks,3docjv,MattAlbie60,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"I talked about it below, but basically they solicited the Heaven's Ladder oversized GN too early and to make matters worse solicited his first JLA issue for the same month. Hitch ended up spending his whole run trying to catch up to deadlines. When Marvel offered him The Ultimates, he was more than happy to run away from the whole experience and Waid decided to leave to title, since he was already pretty pissed at DC for the ""Superman Now"" fuck up. If you read the run knowing Hitch's issues, it becomes pretty obvious that Waid kept trying to find ways to justify having other artists drawing parts of many issues."

Waid, Morrison, Peyer and Millar were supposed to take over the Superman comics in the turn of the century. They had a huge pitch, the whole thing was accepted, it was ready to be solicited and then some higher up noticed they were about to give them carte blanch on Superman and cancelled the whole thing, forcing editorial to scramble to find  new creative teams in something like a month.  According to Morrison, his presence was the main issue, as the execs told him they'd ""never give him the keys to the company car"".  It was the reason he showed them the middle finger and went to Marvel.  You can find large parts of the pitch on the web if you search on google. It's pretty interesting, as you find story elements that Waid, Morrison and even the substitute creative team ended up using, later on."

The few times someone gets to write him with a real personality--when he gets to be a character instead of a generic brute-style villain--he can really stand out.   I like him as the reasonable, reformable badguy. I can imagine a reformed Killer Croc coaching youth basketball and teaching kids about sportsmanship, or helping Batman's crew with the occasional mystery when he has information from his old mobster days. Or, going the other way, I can see him taking control and being a serious villain.   The one version of Croc I don't like is the dumber-than-dirt might-be-a-cannibal generic badguy."

comicbooks,3dop9t,RidleyScotch,4,Sat Jul 18 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the various iterations of the Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man costumes in the current movies are probably my favorites. They're very literal interpretations of the comic book art for the most part, but are fleshed out just enough to fit into a film world. The Batman costume is also a great fit for this era of Batman movies.  I actually think that Superman's iconic costume is one of the hardest to adapt to the screen, especially for modern sensibilities. It's so blocky and spandexy and unapologetically comic-book-hero (in part because it really helped define and codify that look to begin with) that I sort of feel like you have to tinker with it to some degree to ground it, but it's hard to tinker with it too much without either losing something or feeling like you're ashamed that you're making a Superman movie. (It's pretty similar to how tinkering with Superman's costume works in the comics - while there are a few exceptions, generally overhauls to the classic look don't really work that well.) The Man of Steel costume (and the CW Flash costume, which faces similar challenges) are, I think, good fits for the tone of their productions, but it definitely feels like more sacrifices have to be made in adapting those costumes than for someone like Batman.  One thing that I think is kind of clever about the MCU costumes in the Avengers movie is that there's a strong correlation between how much the character buys into the idea of being a comic-book style hero and how comic-y the character's costume is. Hawkeye, Bruce Banner, and Black Widow wear things that are much less costume-y, with little or no iconography.  One character design that could have easily gone very wrong, but didn't, is Rocket Raccoon. If you make that character any more human-like or any more raccoon-like or any more or less cartoony or more or less cute or facially expressive, then I think it breaks."
comicbooks,3dop9t,Daiteach,0,Sat Jul 18 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"I can't say i've paid much attention to Cap and Thor's costumes in the film, to me they look very similar probably due in part to my interest in their characters being low and having not read many books about them. But I feel as though Iron Man's various suits allow for the designers to experiment more with Tony's personality and showcase the various tasks he can and does do with his armor.  Each Iron Man suit definitely has its own flavor to it.  I see what you are saying about Superman's costume, this is very much the archetypal superhero costume in both design and color. I think what the films accomplish is they both update the costume for a 2015 audience while still keeping the classic look and feel but adding contemporary elements, even going so far as to make it look somewhat alien with the use of texture.  The Flash costume I agree with you on. I feel that due in part to The Flash's humor and ""comic book-ness"" a somewhat classic Flash attire is perfectly acceptable and fits well within the bounds of what we see on the show. It definitely feels like a real costume with the texture and material resembling a thick leather almost like the clothing motorcyclists wear that incorporate thick leather and body armor. Plus the Flash mask or hood is done in such a way that it doesn't look or feel out of place.  Your criticism of The Avengers costumes is pretty spot on. Those characters which see themselves as heroes or beacons of hope so-to-speak have the more iconographical outfits. Whereas those who are just doing their job or i guess unsure of who they are/scared of who they are in the case of Bruce/Hulk don't outfit themselves with attire that bring the attention to them.  Having seen some of the Hawkeye costumes from the comics with the purple costume and helmet/mask thing that would certainly not translate well into the Marvel/Avengers world of ""real life"" superheroes, that costume just feels too comic booky to be something that a crime fighting archer would wear in reality. So, bring Hawkeye's attire into something more real worldy like they have done fits the character that has been established in the film and fits in the universe.  Rocket Raccoon probably wouldn't have looked as great on screen if he had to wear that blue button down attire that is seen sometimes in the comics, that looked too uniform like and the character's personality doesn't come through. Just like in the prison sequence in GOTG the yellow jumpsuits strip all the characters of their visual style and personalities."
comicbooks,3dop9t,drakesfolly,3,Sat Jul 18 19:10:12 2015 UTC,The modern trend of adding texture to the costumes' fabric while keeping the classic color schemes is a great way to translate them to the screen.  Have you looked at Christopher Reeve's costume in HD? He looks like a cartoon with live action head and hands.
comicbooks,3dop9t,tasteyspiderham,2,Sun Jul 19 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"At the minute you can see (particularly DC) trying to be more faithful to the comics, if you look at Batman's BVS costume it does look like it has been pulled out of DKR, and deadshot is getting the classic silver mask. Some characters it seems to work by being faithful others it doesn't, like Scarlet Witch, if she had that massive headpiece in the film she would have looked dumb."

comicbooks,3dmcfu,Introcourse,6,Mon Jul 20 19:24:31 2015 UTC,"Here is my haul   Island: Issue 1 Trees #11 Hawkeye #22 Lumberjanes #16 Sandman Vol. 7-10 Gotham Central Vol. 1 Batman Vol. 5 - Zero Year - Dark City   I started re-reading Sandman, and Vol. 7-10 I borrowed from the library the first time I read it, so I figured I may as well complete my collection.  Batman is one of the few superhero comics I actually read, but I only collect in trades. As you can see, I am still one volume behind, but I'll pick that up when it is released in paperback.  Hawkeye 22 is finally out, thus concluding my current Marvel/DC issue by issue pickups for the time being. As I mentioned with Batman, I don't read many superhero comics at the moment, and when I do, trades are how I do it so I can ignore the crossover events and assume all relevant issues will be included in the trades. Hawkeyes has been something special, and despite the delays and issues behind released before the previous issues, I loved it. Kate Bishop's story was great, and Clint was portrayed perfectly. Fraction did wonderful work writing the perfect book about the formerly worst-dressed Avenger. And Aja's art - phenomenal.  Trees is amazing so far, I love when Warren Ellis has something to do longer than a 6 issue arc for Marvel or DC.  Lumberjanes, I just started reading last week, really enjoyed the first 8 issues. Starting on issue 9, the artist changed and I enjoy it far less, but I figured I should pick this up and see if the story has pulled me in enough yet that I can look past that, or consider ending this purchase, but as I have gone to issue 16 without stopping, it seems to be something I will continue picking up.  The Island I have nothing to say about yet as I haven't read it, but it looked interesting and I pick up most Issue #1s of Image books to see if I like them.  Gotham Central I have been meaning to read for a long time, I love both Rucka and Brubaker, and I know I'll love this.  Giant Days is the only other comic I wanted this week, but I had to get my shop to start ordering it for me. It is basically Deadly Class, but with female leads, set in college, and no murder. I love it."

comicbooks,3diw31,MadThinkerScott,153,Thu Jul 16 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"The original Wolverine mask looked a lot more like a wolverine - but when he joined the X-Men, Gil Kane drew his mask wrong on the cover (with the pointy ears and the blank eyes and stuff), and Dave Cockrum liked it so much that they kept it.  So then when he eventually took his mask off, they gave him the pointy hair so his silhouette would still look vaguely like his costume and he'd be easy to recognize.  Same goes for his claws - originally they were supposed to be part of his gloves and permanently out (like wolverine claws), but it was later changed.  (Not trying to ruin the humor of this post, just wanted to point out that they at least planned to make him like a Wolverine at first and then the design sort of evolved without planning.)"

(Well, they say blue and maize.) If not, it seems an odd choice of colors. I thought the costume he took from Fang of the Imperial Guard, which was loosely based on the Legion of Superheroes' Timberwolf's, was a more appropriate for the character name with it's more natural, wolverine-like colors.  I recall reading somewhere that the claws were originally supposed to be part of the costume. I think everyone is glad that was changed!"

comicbooks,3doovc,Drone717,7,Sat Jul 18 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"To me it's the difference of owning a copy or the real deal. Like how people go to see the Mona Lisa instead of a copy up on someone's living room wall.  Some of the stories and characters have affected me in different ways so I want to own those first appearances or epic runs. I don't buy spendy comics just to own spendy comics, just the ones that mean a lot to me. They're valuable, but I don't mind paying a high dollar price when they are worth more to me than asking price.  I'm also somewhat of a completionist, so collecting an entire series of say, Uncanny X-Men gives me pleasure in life. I love being able to look through a drawer and see each issue in order. I get to look at each piece and appreciate it for the piece of art that it is. Even though some are worth a lot of money, I also get to read those issues and dig inside the writer's mind. A story the creative team made for others to love. It's like I get to own a piece of their imagination.  I'm sure there are lots of other reasons, but these were the first that came to mind."
comicbooks,3doovc,DaddyDaz,4,Sat Jul 18 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"To me it's the difference of owning a copy or the real deal.   As someone that's tempted to spend $100+ on personally significant issues, this is the best explanation I've seen. I fully know how ridiculous it is, as $3.99 is already a steep price for 22 pages. But a lot of comics hold sentimental value, and I like the idea of having the very first printing that started it all."

comicbooks,3dnvut,Wrenware,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:16:04 2015 UTC,"Here's a bit more information about the series:  The plot:   Larry Larrison always wanted to be a superhero, but as the costumed vigilante Blue Steel, he's never achieved anything more than a broken nose and a bruised ego. The only place he's ever successfully been a hero is in his favourite video game--and when that video game starts suddenly and inexplicably coming to life, Larry and his motley band of sidekicks suddenly find themselves the only ones around with the know-how to save their home town from chaos, destruction, and the ultimate Game Over...   The project:   The webseries will be coming out in September, in ten ten(ish) minute installments. Even though it's not based on any existing property, we really wanted to create something that had the feel, visually and narratively, of being adapted from a comic book. It's a story that blends video game and comic book conventions together in what we hope will be a new and original way.  The series was very much made on a shoestring budget, but we're proud of how it turned out. We plan to put out plenty of additional content in the run-up to release, including behind the scenes information for anyone out there interested in making a we-series of their own, so we hope you'll keep an eye out for more from us in future."

comicbooks,3dn8qy,YourJamesOver,4,Fri Jul 17 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, its a good question. he's a challenging character to write. I can think of a few things that could be done (most of which have been done, to varying degrees in stories before), and might make for some interesting story potential   a countermeasure to his abilities (e.g. Magneto's helmet, or Sentinel robots with no organic mind to begin with) opposing psychics that can match him, or at least provide a plausible challenge (White Queen, Mastermind, Shadow King, etc.) situations that psychic manipulation doesn't solve. a ring of super powered bank robbers can be trivially taken down by Prof X with cerebro. an erupting volcano? not so much. showcasing the actual limits of his abilities. mental strain, physical fatigue, and hard questions of morality and ethics are all things that Xavier has to deal with. he's very powerful, but not unlimited in power.  writing stories about the reasons Xavier doesn't serially abuse his abilities. maybe he's adopted a cautious stance out of painful lessons learned, rather than merely obeying a personal honor code. maybe in the past he was more cavalier about using his powers and caused a lot of injury and collateral damage that he didn't anticipate. highlighting the extreme trust issues that other characters would naturally expect to have with a psychic of Xavier's power level. he's so powerful that he can read your mind and plant false memories without you ever knowing he did it. if you know that he is capable of that, wouldn't you be justifiably nervous around him?  writing stories where Xavier actually does use his abilities to their full extent. just take it to the logical conclusion and see what happens. this could make an interesting (perhaps cautionary) tale."
comicbooks,3dn8qy,metaphorm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely all good ways to handle it, and many I've seen certain writers do at one time or another, so it's curious why things like that aren't done more often.

Black Widow doesn't call Thor because (a) she can handle it herself (b) there's no guarantee he's available.  He could be in Asgard or fighting a giant monster. He doesn't have omni hearing or super speed on the level of superman.   It sometimes can be explained in universe too.  Why doesn't Xavier mind control everyone?  Well,  they kinda explain it.   Though sometimes it's bad writing in the reverse - heroes not asking for help when they could and should.  Batman is really bad at this.  Another big example is Death of Wolverine. He literally had other heroes ask to help him, and he says no. Bad writing imo.  TL;DR - Superman's powers cause a lot of problems"

In the case of Gotham specifically, I thought they had a pretty good explanation. Batman has a no super powers rule that he enforces. The super heroes stay out of Gotham and the super heroes super vilains stay away.   If and when one does encroach upon Gotham his reaction is usually to hammer them into submission with maximum force. Can't remember where I read it but there was one example where a super hero came to town and he blew them out of the sky with a Wayne Tech Super Rocket Launcher or something.

I started to input my collection, but stopped about 10% through when I was finding a lot of series and issues missing. You can add missing series and issues with details, but it's time consuming. The creator of the site is on reddit, and has been great when I've had trouble, but the site still needs some improvement imho. If you don't have a massive collection, and/or don't mind assisting with additions I completely recommend this site. The creator was willing to take lists of missing series and issues to add, but may take a while as there's a big back log. Again though, cool guy and cool site. There's also no export feature, but the creator said he'd be willing to send me an export if I needed one.   http://comicbookrealm.com/ will let you set up an account to keep track of your collection. Also free, but doesn't have a lot of the nicer features. The site is also a free price guide, and will tell you about how much you're collection is worth.  http://comicspriceguide.com/ is another price guide site that lets you categorize your collection. Not a lot of features, but it's free.  Google Docs is what I've been using for years, but you'll have to set up your own spreadsheet. You can make your own headings to organize anyway you like, but it's not as nice as some of the other cataloging sites. It does have a free app with offline mode which is nice. If you're looking for something simple, this is the my recommendation.   http://www.collectorz.com/ is pretty sweet. I just downloaded two of the free trials (one for comics and one for games), and have been pretty impressed so far. The downside to that site is it can get spendy. $30-50 for each program and you'll need to kick out another $15 if you wanted the app. I'm considering picking up both the pro versions of the comic and game editions of the software, and that'll cut each program down to $40 each ($80 total instead of $100) with the bundle discount. You also get a discount code for $5 off if you download the free trial. EDIT: I ended up buying the software and app for both the comic and game versions. The app actually came with a free barcode scanner, and works really well. I'm really impressed with this software so far."

Also I hate that they kept the scars on nightcrawler, I think they look stupid as hell. The designs are slipping further toward the first 3 x-men movies and further away from first class. I don't like it."
comicbooks,3djixf,300FeetPerSecond,17,Thu Jul 16 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"I agree and it is disappointing. At least Psylocke is basically ripped directly from the comics.   First Class was the best and most ""X-Men"" movie there has been so far, IMO.   Those bright yellow/blue jumpsuits make me swoon every damn time."
comicbooks,3djixf,steve_millers_joker,10,Thu Jul 16 21:51:16 2015 UTC,I just have a real difficult time getting past Havok being in the film not as Cyclops' brother.
comicbooks,3djixf,300FeetPerSecond,8,Thu Jul 16 22:15:37 2015 UTC,"There's definitely things that can be nitpicked. Fox/Singer/Ratner kind of made it imposible to get everything right without a real and true reboot.  However, the tone/teenage mutant aspect I feel was captured the best in First Class.   I mean, I hated how beast has looked in both DoFP and FC but what can you do."
comicbooks,3djixf,steve_millers_joker,2,Thu Jul 16 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm with you on the Beast thing. I wish they had gotten a beefier dude to play non-transformed beast, and I didn't like how the color and fur texture didn't match Kelsey Grammer's makeup. I think they were trying to push the whole scientist angle but in the earliest iterations Beast looks like a strongman. The overall look of the film was much closer to the original themes."
comicbooks,3djixf,300FeetPerSecond,3,Fri Jul 17 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. Nicholas Hoult is a perfectly fine actor... even if his characterization of Beast is a bit meek. Though that could just be writing.   For physical attributes he's about as far from Beast as you can get. I mean Hugh Jackman is a damn tree compared to Logan but at least he pulls off the look for the most part.   I think they tried to go for a more Astonishing X-Men Cat-Beast in FC but the Makeup was bad. Not entirely sure what inspired his look in DoFP (a werewolf?) but all around the makeup was just bad, especially at the end in the new timeline, that was some intern makeup artist looking shit.   I agree Kelsey Grammer so far in X3 was the best. Closest to the beast design from the 90s.  Not really looking forward to more Hoult in Apocalypse. =/"
comicbooks,3djixf,steve_millers_joker,2,Fri Jul 17 01:43:58 2015 UTC,"Same here, and I'm really not feeling to great about the Apocalypse design. I wish they had gotten a guy with a bigger head/jaw. I think Pearlman killed it in his Hellboy makeup, and it was all in the head shape. And if they couldn't manage that (I know that would be kind of constraining parameters to find in an actor) I liked how they did Damion Poitier's makeup and prosthesis for his shot in the credits after Avengers. I wish they'd done something like that for Apocalypse."
comicbooks,3djixf,300FeetPerSecond,2,Fri Jul 17 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give the Apocalypse design a shot. I am really kind of hoping he goes through stages and I really like Oscar Isaac.   My biggest beef and my only real request was a correct skin color and his dark blue lips.  I'm really not happy about it either but if I'm not condemning the Joker because I trust Leto to make me get over it, I am gonna do the same with Oscar Isaac.   It is pretty bad looking though =/"
comicbooks,3djixf,steve_millers_joker,2,Fri Jul 17 02:09:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I would be fine with it if he was going through different physical stages and gradually kept getting bigger just so long as at some point he is a towering figure.

If you really do want to read everything though there are Golden Age omnibuses for both Batman and Superman, and there are Amazing Spider-Man Masterwork collections that have a lot of the old stuff.  Western comics are more expensive because 1. They're less popular but require the same amount of work and 2. They're usually in colour which makes printing more expensive."

I like what they're doing now, I've had a similar meta-arc in mind called Mount Olympus where he's depowered to human levels but slowly gains them back while metaphorically climbing Mount Olympus back to godhood. Though the climatic battle isn't between him and the main villain (Lex obviously) but Batman and Lex where Supes is off stopping a world ending terror and Batman explains to Lex that Supes had already won, and had done so long ago because unlike Lex Supes or at least what he stands for is going to live forever. Then Lex throws Batman off a mountain, Supes catches him and that where it ends--Supes floating above Lex asking him to turn himself in....and I just realized I typed out a summary of a fan-fiction."

In a vulnerable character like Captain America I love this type of personality.  In a living god it's terrifying and authoritarian.  I'm not the only one who thinks that, and the stories of Superman going full Stalin are the ones I actually enjoy.

Some of his power fluctuations are annoying, it's tough to suspend disbelief. Who's rooting for the guy who can bench press planets? I am. Not only so I can throw that in my friends' faces during our monthly 'Goku vs. Superman' debate, but it's an interesting trait to have. I also have had to try to tell them that he shouldn't be a Christ figure. The parallels are there, but I don't think that's the right interpretation. Superman is basically every-power guy. And there's a million reasons how each one of his powers works. Sometimes they fit and sometimes they don't. If you can't suspend disbelief, it makes it really difficult to enjoy Superman. I honestly just find the best explanations I can and try to stick with them. Like how his freeze-breath is the same principle as aerosol, but Super! And that his vision can see ""cosmic waves"" through everything except for lead. And that kryptonite drains him because his body instinctively  absorbs the radiation energy from the irradiated piece of his home planet, whether it's Red Sun radiated or not. They're all just handwaves, man. I like the idea of a farm-boy who just kind of realizes he has every power and tries to do the right thing. Sure, there's plenty of angst to be found in his ""I don't want to crush everything I touch"" stuff, or his ""Last son of a dead world"" baggage. When it's done right, it's pretty great to see something so big, Superman is the one who has to take it down. It gets a little stale, him winning. It's not always complex, but it's just like every other superhero, sometimes they're written well and sometimes they aren't. Just gotta stick to the stuff you enjoy. It's a little weird that you want the symbol of righteousness to be vulnerable, but I'm not gonna hold that against you. Mary Sue is practically a phrase like Manic Pixie Dream Girl. It's a nonsense term for anytime someone isn't written ""well enough."" It's a caricature. C'mon,""I'm Batman and I have every fucking thing planned to a t from the very first moment I conceptualized the shape of this room"" is just as Mary Sue nonsensical. I'm not gonna push Superman down your throat. He's not for everyone. He's fun and he's inspiring. It's good when it's good and it's bad when it's bad. He's just a guy who can do everything trying to do the right thing.  TLDR; You're not going to change your opinion."

comicbooks,3dkdwp,bennzor,7,Fri Jul 17 03:53:00 2015 UTC,I'd argue that's because he was the first. But not everyone can have powers as unique as metal bending.

comicbooks,3dobxq,weirdmountain,3,Sat Jul 18 02:40:02 2015 UTC,the black latern right?
comicbooks,3dobxq,yokobueno,2,Fri Jul 17 22:40:46 2015 UTC,Yep. The character Black Hand murdered his family then himself so he would be raised as a zombie at the beginning of Blackest Night.
comicbooks,3dobxq,jacobtie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:48:37 2015 UTC,"that reminds me of the inverse in helheim. dude fights a futile battle to protect his family from undead horde, dies, and his witch girlfriend stitches him back together to be her draugr champioin"

comicbooks,3dij30,TimothyVH,47,Thu Jul 16 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"Alright, that does it. As someone whose only experience with Hellboy is the movies, where do I start with the comics?"
comicbooks,3dij30,AudaxDreik,44,Thu Jul 16 17:12:15 2015 UTC,It's only one series... Start from #1 and go til today. They're up to 13 trades and 6 library editions that have 2 trades each.
comicbooks,3dij30,bananapants919,43,Thu Jul 16 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, alright then. As someone who reads a lot of Marvel it's refreshing to be told you can just start at #1 and read in order..."
comicbooks,3dij30,AudaxDreik,14,Thu Jul 16 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"And you have BPRD to enjoy as well.  It's sort-of a spin-off from Hellboy, but it's structure is the same- start at #1 once the ""split"" happens in the Hellboy books (you'll know it when it happens) and just keep going with BPRD, which then turns into BPRD: Hell on Earth.  Once the split happens, the events of Hellboy and BPRD don't really interact with each other much, if at all.  You are in for some of the best stuff in comics, by the way."
comicbooks,3dij30,MeaninglessGuy,22,Thu Jul 16 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I was gonna say, the fact that you even have to ask that shows just how messed up DC and Marvel have gotten with the awful crossovers... I'll take a story that is contained in one book, thank you very much."
comicbooks,3dij30,bananapants919,10,Thu Jul 16 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"It's not just that.  It's that Marvel restarts books with a new #1 every time there is a change in creative team.  At this point, there  are going to be 2 Ms. Marvel #1's in as many years.  It's even worse for Daredevil, which is going to be relaunched for the 3rd time in 4 years."
comicbooks,3dij30,saintsofboredom,3,Thu Jul 16 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"I kind of like that, because each number one is a new jumping point. You can start there, and eventually piece everything together through flashbacks, exposition, etc."
comicbooks,3dij30,MrMacro,5,Thu Jul 16 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"I totally get that.  Right now I'm divided over Marvel's constant relaunches.  Series in triple digits can be really intimidating for new readers, but so is a new #1 ever two years.  Right now I'd be ok with a Hickman Avengers-sized run where you get into the forties and fifties instead of going under twenty issues and relaunching the series."
comicbooks,3dij30,saintsofboredom,7,Thu Jul 16 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"That's just the Hellboy comics.  There's 26+ volumes of BPRD and 3-4 Abe Sapien too.     The end is in sight, the death spiral towards the Apocalypse has begun.  Trouble is the Apocalypse is about to run face first into this crew as well as Abe, HB and the Russians.  Don't think it'll get past them without first having its teeth kicked in."
comicbooks,3dij30,snarkamedes,5,Thu Jul 16 19:08:16 2015 UTC,There's also Lobster Johnson and Witchfinder.
comicbooks,3dij30,SutterCane,20,Fri Jul 17 02:51:29 2015 UTC,"If you get into the whole universe, I recommend using this, or just use it for the main hellboy series of comics."
comicbooks,3dij30,TChickenChaser,2,Thu Jul 16 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, these look and feel beautiful"
comicbooks,3dij30,Goasupreme,4,Thu Jul 16 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"The Hellboy trades are great, but disjointed. I actually suggest grabbing the first one to understand where Hellboy (and the universe he lives in is grounded) is from, but then move into the BPRD series, which makes a lot more sense in terms of story-connectivity.  Once you read a few of the BPRD trades, jumping back into Hellboy isn't so hard, as the odd things that happen make sense with the context created by the BPRD series."

comicbooks,3dij30,gjallerhorn,25,Fri Jul 17 18:53:12 2015 UTC,I read both posts in Ron Perlman's voice.
comicbooks,3dij30,two2teps,21,Thu Jul 16 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"After seeing the movie, honestly, there isn't a voice more perfect."
comicbooks,3dij30,jace100,9,Thu Jul 16 18:39:31 2015 UTC,As if there's another voice to use?
comicbooks,3dij30,LetsGoChuckTaylor,3,Thu Jul 16 23:24:42 2015 UTC,Truth.
comicbooks,3dij30,two2teps,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:38:39 2015 UTC,"Me too, but who voices Hellboy in your head?"
comicbooks,3dij30,gjallerhorn,20,Fri Jul 17 18:56:32 2015 UTC,This scene leads to my biggest problem with the Hellboy movies. Hellboy/Liz is just creepy when you consider he's like an older brother to her.
comicbooks,3dij30,benzenene,11,Thu Jul 16 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, it could have been SO much worse."
comicbooks,3dij30,Kalean,7,Thu Jul 16 20:53:21 2015 UTC,Also frustrating that Abe became such a nerd. Yeah he reads books in BPRD but he's so much more of a grunt than a bookworm
comicbooks,3dij30,HoldOnMagnolia,5,Thu Jul 16 21:23:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. He spends most of his time smoking cigars and killing monsters in B.P.R.D.
comicbooks,3dij30,MageKraze,3,Fri Jul 17 02:06:20 2015 UTC,he spins some serious prose when he writes a letter though.
comicbooks,3dij30,cabose7,12,Fri Jul 17 00:41:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did not like that they forced in a romantic angle into the films."
comicbooks,3dij30,Gauhl,5,Thu Jul 16 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"I forgave most of the changes when I saw that they were doing the Hitchhiker's Guide version of adapting it to different mediums, which is that every different medium has its own completely different continuity. Hell, the animated movies even have the same voices as the live action movies and those aren't in the same continuity."
comicbooks,3dij30,SutterCane,3,Fri Jul 17 02:55:38 2015 UTC,"And that he's, what, seventy years older than her?"
comicbooks,3dij30,LetsGoChuckTaylor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:20 2015 UTC,"Come on, he's immortal. He'd have this problem with any person."
comicbooks,3dij30,Lots42,15,Fri Jul 17 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"Both the Abe Sapien and Liz Sherman part were first posted together, but since I forgot about the 3 pages rule, here they are in two seperate posts"
comicbooks,3dij30,CJGibson,21,Thu Jul 16 15:34:11 2015 UTC,Here's the Abe post for people who haven't already seen it.
comicbooks,3dij30,snarkamedes,32,Thu Jul 16 18:41:47 2015 UTC,Let's not forget Daryl.  It's one of the fun things about Hellboy/BPRD is that often the mission becomes 'recruit it' rather than 'vaporise it with prejudice'.
comicbooks,3dij30,Kalean,5,Thu Jul 16 19:02:19 2015 UTC,Adorable? Question mark?
comicbooks,3dij30,snarkamedes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:25 2015 UTC,??  Well a bloodstained Wendigo gave even Hellboy and Abe a panel's worth of pause there.
comicbooks,3dij30,HoldOnMagnolia,6,Fri Jul 17 04:11:06 2015 UTC,"Don't forget when Abe straight up refused to kill the head of the Russian paranormal division just because he was a mindless zombie hauled out of the ocean.   Fuck, I love the Mignolaverse."
comicbooks,3dij30,LTownGetDown,6,Thu Jul 16 21:22:51 2015 UTC,That was great. Thanks for sharing.
comicbooks,3dij30,CJGibson,5,Thu Jul 16 19:25:49 2015 UTC,"It's /u/TimothyVH's link, I was just crossposting them for easier viewing."
comicbooks,3dij30,Headpool,9,Thu Jul 16 20:54:25 2015 UTC,"I binged the entire Mignolaverse last year and holy crap, this is the most consistently good shared-universe I've ever seen. 20+ years of issues across various series that's all worth reading and keeps an almost perfect continuity, amazing."
comicbooks,3dij30,AJEDIWITHNONAME,7,Fri Jul 17 03:10:01 2015 UTC,Let's not forget about Lobster Johnson. Great pulpy feel to those books. Hell boy is probably my favorite American comic.
comicbooks,3dij30,PercivalJBonertonIV,4,Thu Jul 16 21:20:10 2015 UTC,Those are amazing too but my favourite series next to Hellboy himself is probably Baltimore. Big chance he's going to the next one on my Mignola sleeve
comicbooks,3dij30,AJEDIWITHNONAME,4,Thu Jul 16 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"Baltimore kicks ass, more people should be reading it."
comicbooks,3dij30,petrofire,2,Thu Jul 16 23:18:25 2015 UTC,"he doesn't kick that much ass, the poor basterd only has one leg"
comicbooks,3dij30,KristophGavin,3,Fri Jul 17 11:47:19 2015 UTC,Think I am going to do Witchfinder next myself.
