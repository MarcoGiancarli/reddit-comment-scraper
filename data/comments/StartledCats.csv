StartledCats,3e2sa9,freemoney83,6,Tue Jul 21 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but a cat needs to be able to leap, climb, sneak, scratch stuff and sprint. You are basically handicapping them and denying them common cat behaviour."
StartledCats,3e2sa9,Streetfarm,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, dwarfism/munchkinism in cats is a mutation.   I realize they are also intentionally bred this way, but it's entirely possible that it just happens to be the way this particular kitty was born."
StartledCats,3e2sa9,mister_flibble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"That was exactly how they got to this point.  They (civilisations of old) saw a mutation (shorter legs), and kept breeding that mutation.  Then they saw the mutation got worse/better (depending on how you look at it), and then kept breeding that new mutation. Rinse and repeat, until you have these massively short legged cats.  They would die out very fast in the nature, if humans were not around, but since we are here, they will live on and breed on. (compare dog breeds from 100 years ago to the same dog breeds today, you will see they have changed shape for the worse because of slow inbreeding)"
StartledCats,3e2sa9,Streetfarm,3,Tue Jul 21 19:41:48 2015 UTC,Would you say the same of dogs like corgies? They're bred with short stubby legs and they're happiest little fuckers I've ever seen.
StartledCats,3e2sa9,Narfubel,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"If they look happy and cute, then there is nothing wrong with the inbred side effects of malformed body. /s"
StartledCats,3e2sa9,Streetfarm,5,Tue Jul 21 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"That's not even close to what I said. We've been breeding animals for cosmetic reasons for a long time, there's nothing wrong with it per say. I do agree that if there's serious side effects it's not a good idea but to judge an animal's breeding by judging what long legged cats do is kind of stupid. They can adapt just like dogs did."
StartledCats,3e2sa9,Narfubel,0,Tue Jul 21 18:06:14 2015 UTC,You obviously don't know much about evolution and how humans have completely butchered it when it comes to household animals (not to mention ourselves).
StartledCats,3e2sa9,Streetfarm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"I know quite a bit actually. What humans have done to household animals is quite amazing. We took wild animals and bred them to be companions for our lives, it's pretty fucking spectacular.   Of course not everything would turn out perfect, it's not like we had a fucking genetics lab to do it in."
StartledCats,3e2sa9,Narfubel,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who raised Corgis for years, you're completely wrong here. Every corgi I've ever worked with (hundreds of them) has been happy go lucky like you wouldn't believe. And they can jump, run, and do just about anything else you'd want them to. Their height helps them with their herding (what they were bred for) because they're too low to the ground to be kicked by a horse or cow.   They have a propensity to over eat, which can be an issue given their stature, since they're basically the Danny DeVito of dogs. But as long as you monitor their diet, they can live a long, happy life. Well, as long as any other dog."

StartledCats,3drd8c,iberis,2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how often cats groom themselves. Cats that were taken away from their mother as young kittens generally clean themselves less because they haven't learnt it, so they might need a bath.  I have a black and white cat who obsessively cleans herself but she still needs a rinse down every few months if she's been exploring particularly dirty places! I never use shampoo, though, unless there is motor oil or something similar on her fur."
StartledCats,3drd8c,Missunify,7,Sun Jul 19 07:04:48 2015 UTC,"My kitten was away from his mom too early, and wasn't cleaning his ass properly.  So one day I took his head, and gently put it near his ass area, so he realized it was a problem.    He immediately realized there was a problem, and started washing it.  Not sure if it was a coincidence, but it's 16 years later, and it hasn't been a problem since  Tldr: shoved cat's face in his ass, so he would wash it"

StartledCats,3die7f,branash13,30,Thu Jul 16 16:39:57 2015 UTC,TIL there's difference in English. In Polish we call them all same - żółw.
StartledCats,3die7f,mrbull3tproof,31,Thu Jul 16 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, over here in Germany as well. We call them ""Schildkröte"", no diffrence here either."

StartledCats,3die7f,Skeptical_Romulan,20,Thu Jul 16 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, if you translate both words individually, then it means exactly that :)"
StartledCats,3die7f,ParadoxicGer,7,Thu Jul 16 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you'll have an answer for this, but I've always wondered how germans differentiate between an elk and a moose if they need to be specific or talk about differences between the two species, when the word for both species is Elch.  Is the moose a Grosselch or something?  Is the elk an Elchchen?"
StartledCats,3die7f,AdmiralCrunch9,6,Thu Jul 16 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"Yup, I can, at least I looked it up:P  We call the Elk ""Rothirsch"", which means something along the lines of ""Red Elk"" (red as in the colour) and the moose is called ""Amerkianischer Elch"", which means ""American Elk"""

StartledCats,3die7f,AdmiralCrunch9,3,Thu Jul 16 22:46:53 2015 UTC,"Actually Rothirsch would, literally translated, mean red deer 0:   So, elk = red deer = Rothirsch  moose = Elch"
StartledCats,3die7f,LordGhoul,4,Thu Jul 16 22:55:23 2015 UTC,"The most common name for both animals is just Elch though.  Since there are no moose in Germany I assume that there was little need for distinction when they first heard about moose and they basically thought, ""Eh, it's another big deer-thing, might as well just call it an elk too."""
StartledCats,3die7f,AdmiralCrunch9,3,Thu Jul 16 23:06:37 2015 UTC,"I've never heard anyone call that thing an Elch though. Looks like a deer, so it's called a deer. We may not have moose, but we have crapton of deers around here."
StartledCats,3die7f,LordGhoul,2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"Hm, the times I looked it up elk was always translated as Elch.  But it wouldn't be the first time that conversational usage was different from my dictionary, and it sounds like you're another German, so I'm not about to argue with you about your own language."
StartledCats,3die7f,AdmiralCrunch9,9,Fri Jul 17 00:11:00 2015 UTC,"Well yea they are totally different animals. I remember seeing not too long ago someone on FB threw a tortoise into a lake to ""save"" it. I imagine it died."

StartledCats,3die7f,Spitalian,4,Thu Jul 16 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"What?  Many people don't know the difference between a turtle and a tortoise and call them both turtles. Tortoise may not be commonly used, but that doesn't mean that different dialects don't have a word for tortoise."
StartledCats,3die7f,SDMasterYoda,2,Thu Jul 16 21:00:01 2015 UTC,"If different languages don't distinguish the two, there's no reason different dialects shouldn't be able to not make the distinction. There are certainly dialects (ahem... OP's, mine) that use the word turtle for both. It doesn't mean the word tortoise doesn't exist for them. I know the word tortoise, but to me it's just a type of turtle and I personally don't use the word in most cases."
StartledCats,3die7f,Spitalian,6,Thu Jul 16 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses ""turtle"" to describe all species of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are land-dwelling or sea-dwelling, and uses ""tortoise"" as a more specific term for slow-moving terrestrial species.[1] General American usage agrees; turtle is often a general term (although some restrict it to aquatic turtles); tortoise is used only in reference to terrestrial turtles or, more narrowly, only those members of Testudinidae, the family of modern land tortoises; and terrapin may refer to turtles that are small and live in fresh and brackish water, in particular the diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin).[3][4][5][6] In America, for example, the members of the genus Terrapene dwell on land, yet are referred to as box turtles rather than tortoises.[2]  Wikipedia"

StartledCats,3d59d3,boobiesiheart,15,Mon Jul 13 19:34:59 2015 UTC,"You are right about it being mid yawn. And, the reason the whiskers are short is because she's a Devon Rex. The breed has curly and brittle whiskers that break easily. They do a lot better now that we've started supplementing her food with salmon oil."
StartledCats,3d59d3,CaptainSnippy,8,Mon Jul 13 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"Proud owner of a 12 year old Devon Rex here (smartest little guy I know). Salmon oil will keep his whiskers from breaking?   He also gets some whiskers that curl up and get into his eye, those I usually cut off."
StartledCats,3d59d3,Nathanyal,7,Mon Jul 13 20:07:16 2015 UTC,Yes. The salmon oil has helped with both her whiskers and has also reduced her mild eye discharge during allergy season (crusty in the corners and extra noticeable with her white fur). I highly recommend it.
StartledCats,3d59d3,hardypart,3,Mon Jul 13 20:11:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting about the whiskers, does that hinder their mobility?  My understanding is that their whiskers are critical to their everyday movement.  I had no idea that the Devon Rex had brittle whiskers that broke!"

This girl really wanted to try to the swim test and even though we knew she probably wouldn't pass, we still let her try. She sat on the edge of the dock forever not wanting to jump in while all the other kids did their test. Finally she builds up the courage and slides off the dock into the water and slips right under the surface. No splashing, didn't even float on the surface for a second. I was in the water already floating on my tube and was close enough I could see right down to her and she just stared at me for a second from the bottom of the lake until I realized she wasn't coming back up. I reached over my tube and grabbed her arms and pulled her back up. She was fine but that look she gave me from the bottom of the lake was so creepy."

Why would anyone think it's a good idea to keep a panther in their house, and then go swimming with it in just a bikini? This is not a proper wildlife sanctuary, and this kind of behavior with regard to wild animals should be stopped. It leads to poor animal care by amateurs who know very little about exotic species, and attacks which result in horrific injury to the human and euthanasia for the animal."

I feel he's a bit unaware of how strong those animals are because he sees them as family, but they seem to have a lot of staff that are aware of what's up, so maybe it's all good.  Edit: Also, the cub from the gif is Cielo, who you can see on some of their work, so the cub grew up beautifully."

StartledCats,3ctki9,LumberCockSucker,31,Fri Jul 10 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"Humans can, that's why infant swim classes are so common, because even babies have the instinct to hold their breath under water and paddle on top. As we get older if we haven't learned to swim, we instead learn to fear water simply because we never learned to properly navigate it. Even people who never learned how to swim can still float and doggy paddle. The problem is because the fear is so ingrained, they freak out and splash and struggle, causing them to go under, causing more freak out. Just have to relax and let your body do what it does naturally: float."

StartledCats,3co8i6,Mochigood,3,Fri Jul 10 03:26:57 2015 UTC,"I just got a kitten. She's my first kitten, and it's fun to watch her do stuff like practice being scary by arching her back and hopping sideways. She's black though, and her favorite chair to sleep on is black, so I don't get to see her nap often. Perfect camouflage."
StartledCats,3co8i6,GettingHazy,2,Fri Jul 10 05:07:27 2015 UTC,My cats are black and white but they when they curl up to sleep it covers most of the white so they are hard to see in the dark. I've almost sat on them many times.
StartledCats,3co8i6,Goliath_Gamer,2,Fri Jul 10 05:49:09 2015 UTC,"I've learned to pat the seat down first, because I've already sat on her once. Shadows are also difficult. I did not think of this when I got her."
StartledCats,3co8i6,whiteflagwaiver,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:44:37 2015 UTC,I've learned to sit down more slowly. If a cat is in the seat I slowly and gently squish the cat with my butt until they get the hint that it's my turn to have the seat. Once in a while I'll forget and they run off or meow as if I hurt them then I end up chasing them around the house to see if they are actually hurt and to pet them so they don't hate me/plan revenge on me. A day in a life of a cat owner :)

StartledCats,3cl2gn,drbatookhanxx,295,Wed Jul 8 19:12:29 2015 UTC,I think cats get scared by long things because they assume they are snakes. If there is a cord in my house that has been moved my cat will always be really cautious about it until he's convinced it's safe.

The colors are often described as red and black, but ""red"" can instead be orange, yellow, or cream  and ""black"" can instead be chocolate, grey, tabby, or blue.

StartledCats,3ay6tk,DBTeacup,20,Wed Jun 24 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"Well, G.Shepards get a bad rap sometimes because they are often used as police dogs, but they really only display aggression defensively. They're very attuned with their owner, which is the real reason they're used as police dogs (that and their intimidating stature). They are highly intelligent and very emotionally responsive, which means if the owner shows love to that kitteh, the dog will show it love as well, in addition to its natural curiosity.  My personal example is about letting people into my house. We once told a friend to just come in, and my dog almost jumped up and latched onto his arm. It was really scary. But her recognized him last second and stopped. Every other time before (and especially since!) we always make sure to open the door for the person. In doing so, we instinctively show our pup that the guest is okay and he's always happy to greet them with some sniffs and a friendly, though frowned upon, jump.  There was also a time we introduced the pup to a friend's pet mouse. Thankfully, our pup immediately understood the mouse was to be treated nicely. Funnily enough, the mouse smacked him in the nose and suddenly become the alpha! Our pup backed away scared."

You have to adjust your lifestyle a little bit, don't leave things like magazines, books, cardboard boxes laying around because they will destroy them. I actually have two of them. An F1 and an F2. I have a large enclosure in my back yard 16'X24' X 8' High - totally enclosed and attached to my house by a 40' long cat walk, also enclosed. They get out to the enclosure via a cat door. I can't imagine having these guys if they couldn't enjoy the great outdoors and I think if I did have to keep them inside things might be a little different.  As it is now when they play with each other  full throttle, look out! anything in their way as the potential to broken, ripped knocked over etc... You actually become a part of their terrain, look out!   As far as them not being cuddly. It really depends on how they are raised. Neither of mine like to be picked up and held but the F1 when he wants to be is a total mush, lap cat and when he starts purring it is awesome. My F2 is way more sociable. He'll go right up to just about every person who enters my home, take a couple sniffs and then start licking. I inherited both of these guys, all $12,000 dollars worth from my ex wife. When we split she decided they'd be better off with me because of the back yard setup. She had the F1 before we met and the F2 was a birthday present I got for her when we were married."

StartledCats,3aqxhv,Silverlight42,2,Tue Jun 23 09:03:27 2015 UTC,"The Crimson Permanent Assurance plays as a short film at the start of The Meaning of Life, it's not in The Life of Brian.   Having originally conceived the story [of The Crimson Permanent Assurance] as a 6-minute animated sequence in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, intended for placement at the end of Part V, Terry Gilliam convinced the other members of Monty Python to allow him to produce and direct it as a live action piece instead. According to Gilliam, the film's rhythm, length, and style of cinematography made it a poor fit as a scene in the larger movie, so it was presented as a supplementary short ahead of the film.  It was a common practice in British cinemas to show an unrelated short feature before the main movie, a holdover from the older practice of showing a full-length ""B"" movie ahead of the main feature. By the mid-1970s the short features were of poorer quality, or simply banal travelogues. As a kind of protest, the Pythons had already produced one spoof travelogue narrated by John Cleese, Away from It All, which was shown before The Life of Brian in Britain."

She started doing that chirp thing (same as she does with squirrels) - As a hunter, she's not very impressed with the local fare though so, I crushed it and I think she was satisfied with that result, genuinely speaking.   Spiders however, the ones that creep in under the door (large wolf spiders which we have an abundance of) and get in her fur when she ""once"" provoked them.. BAHAHHAHA.   I was afraid for her when she freaked because a spider was crawling on her though. That female cat was more of a man than I would have been.. BAHAHAHA!"

Cats of article  Sailors%27 superstitions:       While in many cultures, a black cat is considered unlucky, British and Irish sailors considered adopting a black ""ship's cat"" because it would bring good luck.   Cats eat rodents, which can damage ropes and stores of grain on board, and they are intelligent animals, so a high level of care was directed toward them to keep them happy. A ship's cat would also create a sense of home and security to sailors who could be away from home for a long time.  Some sailors believed that polydactyl cats were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea. It was believed to be lucky if a cat approached a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it only came halfway, and then retreated. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included: if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hailstorm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.

StartledCats,3aomp3,baggyzed,14,Mon Jun 22 21:57:29 2015 UTC,How.....how did the cat get up there? Did they put it there? Did they not realize it was there until they were in the air?
StartledCats,3aomp3,Reoh,28,Mon Jun 22 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"It probably climbed under the wing to nap, like cats often do - bad choice of location though :-)"
StartledCats,3aomp3,Coolfuckingname,14,Mon Jun 22 09:00:59 2015 UTC,Cats always nap in the sunlight. It  probably wanted to be closer to the sun.
StartledCats,3aomp3,spicy_chicken_wings,19,Mon Jun 22 10:48:34 2015 UTC,How did my cat end up on the neighbor's balcony a few weeks back?!  Cats being cats.
StartledCats,3aomp3,Bluefell,5,Mon Jun 22 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"What in gods name did i just watch?!!!!!!!!!!!!  What the ACTUAL FUCK?  That cat took a nap and woke up in the sky and he doesnt even know what that means. He is very much not startled, but I'm making it up for him! Just check out the couple of meows he does...like he's just irritated that people woke him up. Hilarious.  But just imagine had he jumped down, been caught by the wind, and fallen 2000 feet to the ground. ...Actually being a cat he might have just shaken his head and walked away like, ""Psssht...nigga i meant to do that..."""
StartledCats,3aomp3,trebory6,5,Mon Jun 22 12:19:03 2015 UTC,"Holy shit! That poor cat! This is beyond just startling, poor thing could have died! This is actually very hard for me to watch."
StartledCats,3aomp3,Bluefell,2,Mon Jun 22 15:48:17 2015 UTC,"I thought I was the only one. This is not funny to me at all. I'm horrified this cat managed to sneak on and got a free lift in the air. That the woman was smiling when the cat could have fallen out is just, ugh."
StartledCats,3aomp3,Slay3rrr,3,Mon Jun 22 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"Did she even notice the cat? She seemed completely oblivious. It's like the guy was saying ""HOLY CRAP! THERE'S A CAT UP THERE!"" and she's like ""Oh, hahaha Yeah! This is so fun! I'm so proud of you! Hahaha"""
StartledCats,3aomp3,remeranAuthor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:59:29 2015 UTC,At the end she definitely noticed (I watched the video) the cat.
StartledCats,3aomp3,SocksForBreakfast,2,Tue Jun 23 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"The cat was inside the wing so it was at no risk of falling and if it did fall it would survive, they reach terminal velocity around 30 feet."

StartledCats,3aomp3,Hanjobsolo1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:03:28 2015 UTC,So would it have landed on it's feet?
StartledCats,3aomp3,Szwejkowski,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:58:46 2015 UTC,"One of our cats enjoyed riding in the truck, but this one takes the blue ribbon! She doesn't seem to be startled at all, just enjoying the ride. If the clip is presented as events occurred, it seems they landed and the cat was happy to stay in the wing root as they took off again. Never mind that part. I just watched the video clip from which this gif was taken and it's clear that the gif was edited and looks weird as a result."
StartledCats,3aomp3,UtterEast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:57:04 2015 UTC,That didn't take long. I just saw the video this morning on r/aviation.
StartledCats,3aomp3,BrainOnLoan,-4,Mon Jun 22 16:35:36 2015 UTC,Why the fuck didn't the lady reach of to grab it?
StartledCats,3aomp3,Reoh,30,Mon Jun 22 16:36:09 2015 UTC,If it had objected (as it did when the guy tries to remove it back on the ground) it could have died. Sometimes the right thing to do is nothing.
StartledCats,3aomp3,trebory6,15,Mon Jun 22 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you watch the video, you can see it come to the edge of the wing and think about jumping down. Luckily it realized it was in way over its head and just stayed there meowing sadly."
StartledCats,3aomp3,PersnicketyPrilla,25,Mon Jun 22 12:18:32 2015 UTC,Did she see it?  I can see the pilot deciding to not tell her.
StartledCats,3aomp3,percolater,6,Mon Jun 22 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"She did, but later than the pilot."
StartledCats,3aomp3,Hanjobsolo1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:21:56 2015 UTC,"I watched it again, I don't see a point at which she even acknowledges the cat.   To me it seemed like the guy was saying ""HOLY CRAP! THERE'S A CAT UP THERE!"" and she's like ""Oh, hahaha Yeah! This is so much fun! I'm so proud of you! Hahaha"""
StartledCats,3aomp3,percolater,31,Mon Jun 22 12:19:28 2015 UTC,She probably didn't want to risk dropping it.
StartledCats,3aomp3,Polymarchos,8,Tue Jun 23 00:57:18 2015 UTC,"Ultralights have an open cockpit (no walls, floor, windshield). If that cat freaks out and starts scratching, the only way out is down.   The cat was safer inside the wing."
StartledCats,3aomp3,annoyed_freelancer,6,Mon Jun 22 09:03:07 2015 UTC,Oh shit I thought it was on top of the wing not inside it.
StartledCats,3aomp3,ChipotleSSW,3,Mon Jun 22 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, an easy mistake to make - most people never think about the structural makeup of an airplane wing.  My guess is the cat saw a nice, quiet place for a nap in the sun and had no idea what they got themselves into."
StartledCats,3aomp3,Lord_Punchings,3,Mon Jun 22 18:16:28 2015 UTC,Because you don't ever touch a cat with its claws out.  Incidentally that's my family motto.
StartledCats,3aomp3,Hank_Kapenkie,-37,Mon Jun 22 18:36:02 2015 UTC,How the fuck is this a laugh on /r/funny? The cat could have been killed or endangered the microlight.
StartledCats,3aomp3,Slay3rrr,9,Mon Jun 22 17:33:09 2015 UTC,The cat was fine. The difference between /r/funny and /r/watchpeopledie is often only a few seconds

StartledCats,3aomp3,baggyzed,3,Mon Jun 22 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"To be fair, 90% of what's posted at /r/funny isn't funny at all. This clip is at least amusing, considering that the cat doesn't appear to be concerned but actually seems to be enjoying the ride."
StartledCats,3aomp3,_teslaTrooper,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"A cats terminal velocity is 60 mph, it would have survived the fall."

StartledCats,3aomp3,Ceannairceach,13,Mon Jun 22 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"I found the pilot's reaction pretty funny. The cat itself was just being a cat. Some people think cats are always funny by nature, especially when they pop up when/where you least expect them. Others really have a bad sense of humor."
StartledCats,3aomp3,exzeroex,4,Mon Jun 22 15:38:28 2015 UTC,"The cat was fine, so why not?"
StartledCats,3aomp3,J_andyD,2,Mon Jun 22 11:44:49 2015 UTC,Is it fun in your safety bubble?
StartledCats,3aomp3,AQUA2,-15,Mon Jun 22 12:16:27 2015 UTC,"This actually makes me sad. Why would you bring a cat with you on a plane like that? Wouldn't you be afraid he'd fall? I don't like this :(  Edit: looks like he didn't check before going up in flight. CHECK FOR YOUR DAMN CAT, PEOPLE."

StartledCats,3ak7f2,dominic-sa,170,Sun Jun 21 03:37:46 2015 UTC,It's from smelling the blue thing.
StartledCats,3ak7f2,thepenmen22,44,Sun Jun 21 04:04:08 2015 UTC,I too get the shivers when I smell blue things.
StartledCats,3ak7f2,alienus,20,Sun Jun 21 09:10:30 2015 UTC,"I don't have a sense of smell, so I assume you're joking? Blue doesn't have a smell, does it?  edit: guys I'm serious..."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Nowin,19,Sun Jun 21 10:46:01 2015 UTC,Not unless you have synaesthesia
StartledCats,3ak7f2,FadedPoster,15,Sun Jun 21 10:48:17 2015 UTC,"I actually do have Syntesia, Seeing blue doesnt make me smell anything, but certain smells are blue to me, for example Apples smell ""Blue"" to me."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Ab22H66,9,Sun Jun 21 11:26:03 2015 UTC,That's really cool. There are different forms of synaesthesia though. I kind of wish I had some form of it.
StartledCats,3ak7f2,FadedPoster,7,Sun Jun 21 11:42:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, its definately different for each person, ive spoke to a few people online who have it. Cant say if its a benefit or a detriment though, never experienced life without it."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Ab22H66,9,Sun Jun 21 11:44:42 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I think some forms can be detrimental. There was at least one instance I remember of a person who would experience colour when they heard sound. They had to avoid concerts and other generally noisy places because they'd essentially be blinded by a mess of colours."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,FadedPoster,7,Sun Jun 21 11:48:10 2015 UTC,There's a BBC documentary on synaestasia called 'Derek tastes like earwax' - which refers to a poor barman who associated names with tastes. It's findable on the webs I'm sure.
StartledCats,3ak7f2,l-rs2,5,Sun Jun 21 19:54:45 2015 UTC,"That does sound annoying, for me sounds only trigger it when my eyes are closed"
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Ab22H66,7,Sun Jun 21 12:01:22 2015 UTC,I associate numbers and letters with genders. it's kinda meh. My friend has a colour one.
StartledCats,3ak7f2,PantheraLupus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:13:02 2015 UTC,Does that mean a word will have an overall gender? How feminine or masculine is my username?
StartledCats,3ak7f2,FadedPoster,5,Sun Jun 21 12:30:43 2015 UTC,Generally not words for me but your username has mostly masculine letters in it
StartledCats,3ak7f2,PantheraLupus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:03:42 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not smell at all, as long as i could still identify smells. Like, I'm okay with not smelling apple pie anymore (not really but I'd get over it) but i need to know if i smell bad."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Krono5_8666V8,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"Cool! I see things I hear! Music looks really cool if I really focus on it. Not like floating around in the air though it's more of a behind my eyes thing. Like I see it inside my head, I don't straight up hallucinate colors.   I always thought this was just imagination, but I guess unintentionally seeing dancing colors isn't actually very common"
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Strixxi,3,Sun Jun 21 19:30:33 2015 UTC,Have you ever smelled yellow and green together? Kindof like that.

StartledCats,3ak7f2,GunDA9D2,29,Mon Jun 22 01:56:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the cat version of our shivers. Probably something to do with wanting to dislodge something gross from their feet, but the reflex carries over to when they smell something nasty even if it's nowhere near their feet."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Gyrant,10,Sun Jun 21 06:10:19 2015 UTC,"I've read a few times that shaking the paws in sequence like that is a ""disgust"" reaction.  I had a big fluffy calico princess cat who would do that a lot.  She and my other cat absolutely hated each other, and when the princess cat would watch the other one play, she would get so upset by it, she'd walk off in a huff and shake her paws in disgust."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Robotman1974,8,Sun Jun 21 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"I saw my cat do this twice. Once when presented with fish, which she mysteriously hated, and once when she stepped in her own poo. She kept trying to lick the poo off her paw, but as soon as her face got close she'd smell it, reel back in disgust and give the paw flick, then try again."
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Gyrant,20,Sun Jun 21 19:04:35 2015 UTC,When they get something nasty like water on their feet they do that. Seems to carry over to something that smells nasty to them too.
StartledCats,3ak7f2,surfnaked,4,Sun Jun 21 05:23:29 2015 UTC,Looks like what my cat does to get cat litter off her foot.
StartledCats,3ak7f2,Nowin,2,Sun Jun 21 10:49:21 2015 UTC,"It probably is the same thing that dogs do with rubbing their feet after they smell something bad/take a crap.  It is assumed that the animal does this so its footprint trail doesn't leave a smell that can be tracked.  This cat leg shake is along the same  assumption, that they smell something that might give their trail away so shake to get rid of it."

StartledCats,3ai97r,dietmoxie,21,Sun Jun 21 00:13:34 2015 UTC,I think it's because the car is driving forward
StartledCats,3ai97r,dinosquirrel,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"But it's not moving forward. I assume, yes assume, that the point of this gif is that the tires are supposed to spin because the driver is flooring it, but in these cars they tend to go and not sit spinning the tires. The front tires however, don't have drive to them. Idk"
StartledCats,3ai97r,dietmoxie,7,Sun Jun 21 05:46:36 2015 UTC,"Well, you see, this is actually a much shorter clip of a much longer video.

StartledCats,3aa664,feralstank,11,Thu Jun 18 18:31:24 2015 UTC,Of dicks?
StartledCats,3aa664,hellofromsc,9,Thu Jun 18 17:52:56 2015 UTC,I think your cat is a bird
StartledCats,3aa664,nickodd,6,Thu Jun 18 17:15:42 2015 UTC,She chirps at the birds too!
StartledCats,3aa664,hellofromsc,10,Thu Jun 18 18:32:00 2015 UTC,Do they meow back at her?
StartledCats,3aa664,nickodd,6,Thu Jun 18 18:41:54 2015 UTC,Hmmm not that I've heard! Mostly it's through a window and they ignore her.
StartledCats,3aa664,stoppetite,5,Thu Jun 18 18:45:52 2015 UTC,Same!! He makes some weird sounding meows too.

StartledCats,3a7j6u,PUSClFER,7,Thu Jun 18 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should've said ""perturbed.""  I had no idea about the holy war.  Besides, I think a lot of cats fake the degree with they are startled by anything as a ploy for sympathy, treats, and chin scratchies."

StartledCats,3a7j6u,EnergyDrinkerr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:26:30 2015 UTC,"yeah I think many people on this sub think that startled is synonymous with afraid, confused, surprised, wide-eyed, looking at camera, and curious."
StartledCats,3a7j6u,irssildur,3,Thu Jun 18 04:02:14 2015 UTC,Cats spend half their waking hours mildly startled

StartledCats,3a4ode,SeeShark,95,Wed Jun 17 05:32:48 2015 UTC,It looks like the sweeper cloth.  There must have been a furious battle.
StartledCats,3a4ode,sublimoon,59,Wed Jun 17 10:03:18 2015 UTC,Sweeper cloth. At first she was curious so I put one on her. I had a hard time getting it off from her because everytime I touched her she got startled.
StartledCats,3a4ode,germs53,21,Wed Jun 17 14:33:13 2015 UTC,"Poor cat! Haha, I put ace bandage around my cats midsection once because someone said ti would completely immobilize them.  This was 100% true. My cat went full on plank."
StartledCats,3a4ode,schattenteufel,21,Wed Jun 17 17:02:19 2015 UTC,"My wife's cat is big and dumb and hates getting his claws trimmed.   Luckily we discovered that by attaching a cat harness to him, he becomes completely immobilized.   So now when it's claw-trimming time, the harness goes on. Easy peasy!"
StartledCats,3a4ode,sigwhite,10,Wed Jun 17 17:58:52 2015 UTC,Ahah i need to try this! One of the reasons I bought the robot sweeper was that I cannot brush her and her dead hair goes everywhere.
StartledCats,3a4ode,SeeShark,13,Wed Jun 17 18:41:32 2015 UTC,We once put a cat harness on our cat and she just got stuck in full speed reverse. She spent the next minutes running backwards until we decided to free her.
StartledCats,3a4ode,clear_history,5,Wed Jun 17 21:31:36 2015 UTC,Haha. It's a bloody trophy.

StartledCats,3a4ode,sigwhite,27,Wed Jun 17 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"Apparently you're supposed to ""scold"" the roomba in front of the cat so the cat knows where it stands in the pecking order and won't feel as threatened."
StartledCats,3a4ode,ch00f,36,Wed Jun 17 10:59:34 2015 UTC,"Oh she thinks she the hottest thing in the block, so me scolding the roomba won't have that much effect.  5 minutes after taking this picture she started attacking it, which was quite usefull because it got stuck a lot behind a  chair and her attacking the roomba got it unstuck everytime."
StartledCats,3a4ode,kingeryck,12,Wed Jun 17 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"you are suppose to do that for dogs because dogs don't know where the roomba fits in the 'power chain'.   cats see us not as alphas, but as big cats that are roommates, so i don't think scolding it would help."
StartledCats,3a4ode,Pxzib,5,Wed Jun 17 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"I once heard someone describe cat pecking orders as ""cats aren't very good at solving problems"".  Viciously attacking the roomba is just about as likely a strategy for a cat as ignoring it and then shitting on your bed."
StartledCats,3a4ode,superjujubean,3,Wed Jun 17 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"going outside the litter box is actually a sign of anxiety (or infection, or pain, or alzheimers) so yeah, after being scared by the vacuum and attacking it without being able to kill it, your cat could experience anxiety and poop on your bed.   it's not fair to say our pets are idiots when it is us who have not taken the time to figure out why our pet is doing something. of course some animals do dumb things (my cat eats plastic) but there are plenty of things we can do to make their lives better, and to stop them from doing things that in our eyes are dumb."
StartledCats,3a4ode,Norwegian_whale,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying cats are idiots. I'm saying their problem solving skills aren't entirely up to par.  And if you think anxiety or bad health is the only reason for cats pooping where they shouldn't, you're the one underestimating cats.  The eating plastic thing is a common neurosis, btw, and it's also occurring in humans (mostly pregnant women because hormones). It's an irrational desire to eat decidedly non-edible things. For some reason it's just disproportionally more common in cats."
StartledCats,3a4ode,Norwegian_whale,2,Mon Jun 22 09:58:14 2015 UTC,Oh. Didn't know that. I thought it applied to cats too.
StartledCats,3a4ode,Mathias_Mouse,2,Wed Jun 17 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, it had nothing to do with the fact that it's a noisy vacuum and they have very sensitive ears."

StartledCats,3a4ode,TotesMessenger,3,Wed Jun 17 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"It's kinda stupid (so it needs slight surveillance) and you need to change the filter everytime you use it (so it can get expensive in the long run). I'm currently trying to hack it to use washable filters instead of disposable ones.  But it does the job for cat hair, not much for dirt, crumbs and dust."

Had endoscopy/colonoscopy to make sure there was no structural issues or growths.   My symptoms began to decline around the 3 month mark, which meant I was able to return to university and miraculously finish off my year without damaging my grades too badly, and the symptoms (being frank about it - muchos diarrhea, gassy and bloated, gastric discomfort and pain even with just drinking water, which lead to chronic dehydration which lead to heart arrhythmia etc etc) kept declining until round about the 8 month mark I felt back to normal again; able to eat mostly anything I wanted without  the negative effects etc.   I had to reintroduce things like lactose and alcohol back into my diet very gradually too."

I'm assuming based on the lack on concern for the situation they have the proper facilities to raise and take care of this animal.

In the video they seem to be playing but that orange cat looks pretty pissed when he gets jumped on.   With dogs it's easy because the body language is one im familiar with. What do cats do with their body language to show playfulness or anger?

StartledCats,372ipy,Zoukanix,180,Sun May 24 10:11:07 2015 UTC,"My favorite part was how the Cats were obviously not trying to kill it. I mean, at the end the lion gives it a swat on it's head after it goes for the Lion's paw when she gets distracted for a second and looks away. That was as violent as the lions got though. All the rest of the time they were just backing away slowly and watching it."
StartledCats,372ipy,KShults,158,Sun May 24 11:45:17 2015 UTC,They might be playing with it a little bit but they know better then to try and do anything else. The meat they would get out of it wouldn't be worth the fucked up paw or face from the tornado of claws that mongoose would turn into when fighting for its life.  Lions rarely choose to fight something that has a chance to hurt them. Which is why they always group up on the weakest prey they can find.

The lion has to judge if it is worth possibly getting hurt and if the thing is trying to attack it might be worse to tangle with.  The Lion will have to be a lot hungrier to attack something that isn't acting like prey.  Mustelids (Weasels, Badgers and Wolverines) tend to give no shits and not have fear for that reason.

In the narrative, Canute demonstrates to his flattering courtiers that he has no control over the elements (the incoming tide), explaining that secular power is vain compared to the supreme power of God. The episode is frequently alluded to in contexts where the futility of ""trying to stop the tide"" of an inexorable event is pointed out.

It was once believed that they were a part of the dog family, yes, which is where and when I'd heard this ""fact"", but they have recently found out that its genetics are more closely related to the puma and the jaguar. It was believed they were ""dogs"" because of their dog-like characteristics (barking, their method of running, that they looked similar to hyenas, body structure, and general behavior) and the fact their claws did not retract. However, the claws DO retract, but there is no claw-sheathe.   So, on one hand, I was wrong, but on the other hand, now you know some cheetah facts!   Source one  Source two"

StartledCats,36pkba,CyberLost,1 point,Thu May 21 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Well, sounds like you had a pretty awesome kitty. But that's not really figuring out the mirror test.

Its title refers to the length of time a bull rider is required to stay on for a ride to be scored. It stars Luke Perry as American rodeo legend Lane Frost and focuses on his life and career as a bull riding champion. It also features Stephen Baldwin as Tuff Hedeman, and Red Mitchell as Cody Lambert. Notably, there is an early appearance by Renée Zellweger.  The film was completed and premiered shortly after what would have been Lane's 30th birthday, in late 1993.

Can confirm they are rather expensive, but the side-quests have kept me busy for almost 10 years now.  As long as you put a lot of thought and care into which faction you join, you'll do pretty well, and keep in mind that unlike other areas, many factions are absolutely exclusionary."

StartledCats,35nv1v,Falcrist,16,Tue May 12 07:29:33 2015 UTC,I think the vertical filming made it that much better. This time.

StartledCats,35nv1v,sabes19,5,Tue May 12 13:40:41 2015 UTC,Yes. But you will still find people complaining on the other 30%. To capture the same portion of the scene they would have to stand further back which isn't always possible. Sometimes filming vertically captures more of the scene.

StartledCats,35nv1v,Hermit_,10,Tue May 12 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"I would argue that holding a phone with two hands is both easier and more stable than clutching it in the palm of one hand. Also, starting or stopping the video is easier when you use the volume key, and tapping the screen to refocus or adjust the exposure point is vastly easier when holding the phone in landscape mode.

There is a story and there is a plot but the big winner here is the unscripted activities of the big cats.  It's playing in Phoenix for the rest of this week.  Trailer  You ever throw a ball or something past a cat and see it chase it?  Well, that what these cats do to motorcycles and bicycles.  And if a tiger wants to capsize a boat, they're going to do just that.  The story is animal hunters say to the government that there's too many cats at the compound and need to be hunted while the reigning cat dominance comes into play that keeps order.    The plot is Tippi and her kids come to stay with her husband who is in charge of studying the big cats but he's not around to receive them when they arrive so it's about him trying to catch up to his family while he has  transportation issues and his family not sure what the deal is with all the big cats.

StartledCats,34wc05,adashiel,11,Tue May 5 11:08:41 2015 UTC,"This cat has extremely poor vision. The reason it bobs its head up and down is to exaggerate the parallax effect.  It probably initially sees the ducks as moving objects but can't tell how far away or how large they are. The cat begins to bob its head to see them from different angles which gives it more information, but they start to occupy so much of its field of vision so quickly that it freaks out and runs off. Even when the ducks are right up on the cat, it's still not sure exactly what's going on (might be a breed thing) and it does one more head bob before turning to run.  That's my take anyway. I'm no biologist or anything.  edit: I realized just a few minutes ago while out for a run that humans definitely do the same thing when you see a bug flying at your face. That rapid head movement where you're kind of trying to decide which way to dodge to avoid the bug - it's the exact same thing. Seeing an object from different angles helps your brain to determine its distance and direction of movement."

We're not nervous about her attacking because we can see she's cautiously curious, not hungrily. Somehow we let her get right up close to this poor, innocent baby chick, then before any of us could stop it, the lunge happened.   That little baby chicken turned and pecked my cat.

StartledCats,34pqk4,Zoukanix,62,Sun May 3 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"In most mammals eye dilation usually indicates desire, irises generally contract in mammals when startled due to the release of norepinephrine. This cat is more like ""Oh shit I love that."" As opposed to ""Oh shit what the fuck is that?!""  Source: Biochem major, but I can probably find an article if you'd like"
StartledCats,34pqk4,BarelyBen,23,Sun May 3 16:19:18 2015 UTC,I thought that eye dilation also occurred with a surge of adrenaline to increase vision? Or is that a myth?
StartledCats,34pqk4,codeverity,4,Sun May 3 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"The surge of adrenaline does increase vision in a way. If your eyes dilated when you were trying to get away from a predator in daylight, it would burn your eyes. That's a distraction. The contraction, also allows the eyes to focus down on a specific area of vision, it reduces peripheral vision in exchange to better notice differences in your surroundings directly ahead of where you're looking. (Best for fighting or fleeing from a predator)."
StartledCats,34pqk4,BarelyBen,8,Sun May 3 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"Another fairly definite eye sign relates to pupil size. If your cat's pupils are constricted and slit-like, his mood is probably ambient, bordering on vegetative. Or perhaps it's predatory. However, if your cat's pupils become fully dilated in broad daylight, appearing as large black pools, he's either in pain or ready to fight or run away. Increased pupil size is not intended to intimidate other cats or people but rather to allow more light into the eyes. Cats' pupils are always large at night but veterinarians learn very quickly to beware when a cat's pupils are fully dilated in a brightly lit examination room."
StartledCats,34pqk4,Ifriendzonecats,21,Sun May 3 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"Cats eyes dilate to let in more information when they're very interested in something. Be it a noise that surprised him, like in this gif, or when hunting.   Really I think you're out of your element here. This behavior is really basic cat owner knowledge."
StartledCats,34pqk4,Mulsanne,6,Sun May 3 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"Yup. If I'm on my couch and I start stracting the carpet or something, my cat's eyes will completely dilate."
StartledCats,34pqk4,eneka,14,Mon May 4 04:56:47 2015 UTC,Look at the ears. That's a cat who just heard a sound and is in flight or fight mode.
StartledCats,34pqk4,Ifriendzonecats,14,Sun May 3 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah despite being a know-it-all undergrad, none of what he's saying actually accurately describes cat behavior."
StartledCats,34pqk4,Mulsanne,9,Sun May 3 21:14:17 2015 UTC,Really? My cat's eyes dilate when they see another cat they don't like and other times when they're startled or scared.
StartledCats,34pqk4,silentxem,-11,Sun May 3 19:14:02 2015 UTC,I would imagine that what you're seeing is the cat's eyes compensating for a change in light. Looking out at the horizon let's in plenty of light then when he focuses on one spot in the yard there's much less sunlight getting into his eyes so it would make sense for them to dilate. Cat's eyes are extremely sensitive
StartledCats,34pqk4,BarelyBen,14,Sun May 3 19:30:49 2015 UTC,None of your comments really seem to apply to cats. Basic cat readings contradict what you're saying.
StartledCats,34pqk4,Mulsanne,4,Sun May 3 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"I take that into account when I make these observations. It doesn't really explain the change in my cat's pupil when they're sitting still, indoors, and see another cat walk around the corner, or when they hear a noise and raise their head. Every cat I've owned has had dilated pupils when agitated, so I always assumed it was just a response to stimuli indicating danger."
StartledCats,34pqk4,silentxem,5,Sun May 3 20:00:05 2015 UTC,Do you know the evolutionary reason why the eyes dilate and contract like this?
StartledCats,34pqk4,notMyRealName420,3,Sun May 3 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"The iris is an aperture. Dilation allows more light to hit your photoreceptors, allowing a better view of the surroundings."
StartledCats,34pqk4,plurality,-8,Sun May 3 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"The dilation is generally for seeing better at night. Cat's have exceptionally good night vision due to how wide their eyes can dilate, how sensitive the photoreceptors are, and how many of those cells they have. The dilation is associated with light, anxiety, and alertness levels. Dilation is for seeing everything better. Contraction is for seeing something very specific better"

StartledCats,34pqk4,cantfeelmylegs,1 point,Wed May 6 06:30:14 2015 UTC,"Toothless (from Dreamworks wikia):       During the film's commentary, directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois along with producer Bonnie Arnold reveal that Toothless's movements and body outline was based on one of the artist's cat. Toothless is the rare Night Fury, a dragon never seen by vikings due to its speed and camoflauge in the night. He is dark black that helps him blend into the night sky and is sleek and agile for speed. Toothless has wings like any other dragon and a tail with twin smaller wings for balance. Unfortunately, Toothless is injured in the beginning of the movie and loses his left tail-wing. His eyes are an intense green that could shift from docile to dangerous whenever the moment calls for it. Toothless was at first named due to his seemingly lack of teeth, but Hiccup later learns that his teeth are retractable. He apparently has ears, yet the film's commentary stated that they weren't ears but more of part of his body. This Night Fury has four legs with sharp claws used for fighting or hunting. And lastly, Toothless has a noticable snout like all the other dragons.

This small cat is widely distributed in the deserts of North Africa and Southwest and Central Asia. Since 2002, it has been listed as Near Threatened by IUCN because the population is considered fragmented and small with a declining trend.   Sand cats are found in both sandy and stony desert, living in areas far from water. Having thickly furred feet, they are well adapted to the extremes of a desert environment and tolerant of extremely hot and cold temperatures.   Victor Loche was the first European to describe the sand cat, doing so in 1858 on the basis of a specimen found in the Algerian Sahara. He proposed to name the species in recognition of Jean Auguste Margueritte, who headed the expedition.

This is how Cheetaro the leopard came to be with them:  Cheetaro arrived at Big Cat Rescue in November 2003 from a roadside zoo. Cheetaro was confined to a corn crib with his mate and bred constantly so that his cubs could be sold.  They braved the New England winters together where a chill factor of -18 degrees wasn’t unusual.  They had no way to escape the sleet and snow.  They had only the shelter of the corn crib's tin roof and a box.  They had no choice but to  survive by enduring their fate together.  When the roadside zoo closed in 2003, Cheetaro’s mate was sold off and Cheetaro, being male and of no value, was sent to Big Cat Rescue.  Here he lays lazily in the sun on top of his cave mountain, or can hang out in his tree, but he has forever been separated from the mate he loved.  One of the wiliest cats at the sanctuary, he spends hours stalking the house cats, peacocks, and visitors from his large grassy cat-a-tat. Like all leopards, he excels at sneaking up on people when their backs are turned. The keepers are always very aware of where Cheetaro happens to be whenever they clean his cat-a-tat or prepare his food.  Big Cat Rescue visitors are always captivated by Cheetaro as he sleeps or keeps watch on everything from high in his oak tree. He provides a clear demonstration to all of how leopards spend most of their time in the wild. So many of us have been to Africa and yet have never been fortunate to get close enough to photograph a wild leopard in a tree. That’s why we consider ourselves very lucky that we have many breathtaking photos of this “wild and crazy” leopard lounging on the branches of his tree.  This is his favorite spot. We can never make up for the life he had to endure, but we try every day to make life as enriching as we possibly can for him."

StartledCats,34hk8q,SexualCannibalism,10,Fri May 1 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"Section 8. Reproduction and life history of article  Mantis:       Sexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity, and under some circumstances may also be observed in the field. 90% of the predatory species of mantis participate in sexual cannibalism.  The female may begin feeding by biting off the male’s head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male’s movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male’s head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilisation while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior in the field is natural, or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer, remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms, and notice any disturbance occurring in the laboratory or field such as bright lights or moving scientists. Research by Liske and Davis (1984)  and others found (e.g. using video recorders in vacant rooms) that Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Courtship display has also been observed in other species, but it does not hold for all mantises.

StartledCats,34dw46,compbioguy,10,Thu Apr 30 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"While a vet visit to check on unusual behavior is never a bad idea, the ""poo friskies"" can also be attributed to the same behavior that makes them cover their waste: concealment. A cat who leaves a smelly deposit and calmly hangs around the area is easy meat for a larger predator; one that feels inspired to dash off is safer.   Three of our four cats get the poo crazies, and they're in perfect health. It's just their habit to run around like wild things. Get your vet to take a look at everything, monitor what's left in the litter (I know, every owner's favorite part of pet ownership is seeing where litter box contents are on the Bristol Stool Scale), and you and the kitty should be all good."

StartledCats,34dw46,compbioguy,-5,Thu Apr 30 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"Not from my limited experience.  One of my cats does it now, but she hates it if the litter box isn't pristine.  My older cat didn't start doing it until she was getting sick, and my middle cat has never done it.   But I did read, somewhere, that it is a sign of possible sickness: I think from my friend who currently has 5 cats, and who was passing along what he learned about the one cat that was doing this and had a kidney infection."
StartledCats,34dw46,thoughtdancer,4,Thu Apr 30 19:38:30 2015 UTC,My cat will do this sometimes.  Last time we were at the vet they said he was constipated and to give him like a tbsp of unflavored Metamucil with his wet food every day.  It seems like it's helped him a lot.
StartledCats,34dw46,Natasha10005,5,Thu Apr 30 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that?  We've had several cats that have done that and it wasn't because they were in pain.  They just felt good after dropping a deuce is all.  They'd run all over, up and down the stairs, howl at the walls, freak out with their toys, chase the other cats.  Our cat Cleo did that for her entire 18-year life and it wasn't because she was in pain or dying.  I don't think that cat in the .gif is doing anything other than being a cat.  It was passively scratching its ear before it went cuckoo.  That's not a pain reaction.  If a cat's in pain, the most typical thing it will do is slink off and hide."

StartledCats,346cpt,bamgrinus,38,Wed Apr 29 17:16:58 2015 UTC,It's most likely the smell.  If you smell a banana closely it has a sort of turpentine-like smell mixed in. I remember reading somewhere that this part of the smell is really pronounced for cats.
StartledCats,346cpt,woopthat,34,Tue Apr 28 21:32:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, likely this. My cat absolutely hates bananas. I could see him reacting like this.

StartledCats,33uoj5,ImaginarySpider,14,Sun Apr 26 02:03:49 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I wish I got a video of it, but I woulda had the perfect gif for this subreddit - one day in the winter, there was the usual 1-2 feet of snow everywhere but there was also a thick layer of ice on top of it, thick enough that the cats could walk on it.  One of my cats decided to just sit on the ice, in the sitting up position, but eventually his warm but melted the ice and he just suddenly fell through, right to the bottom of the snow."
StartledCats,33uoj5,moeburn,10,Sun Apr 26 01:36:25 2015 UTC,Is this just a cycle in which he was trying to get the other cat out but ends up falling in and then the other cat does the same and it just doesn't stop?

StartledCats,33cmko,Eeku,63,Tue Apr 21 14:06:51 2015 UTC,"Displacement activity:       Displacement activities occur when an animal experiences high motivation for two or more conflicting behaviours: the resulting displacement activity is usually unrelated to the competing motivations. Birds, for example, may peck at grass when uncertain whether to attack or flee from an opponent; similarly, a human may scratch his or her head when they do not know which of two options to choose. Displacement activities may also occur when animals are prevented from performing a single behaviour for which they are highly motivated. Displacement activities often involve actions which bring comfort to the animal such as scratching, preening, drinking or feeding.

StartledCats,33cmko,Vargolol,16,Tue Apr 21 18:22:12 2015 UTC,I thought it overloaded the cat to the point where his instinct was to just dig a hole to escape.

StartledCats,338xpx,Seanzie82,10,Mon Apr 20 19:49:41 2015 UTC,What is it with cats smacking things towards themselves and then getting startled over it?
StartledCats,338xpx,LinearSimcon,29,Mon Apr 20 22:47:00 2015 UTC,"Y'know, for being the extremely effective predators they are, cats have two weird biological traits that I just don't understand: this one, and when they get something stuck on their head, they just floor it in reverse. No attempt to remove the foreign object, just back up back up back up."
StartledCats,338xpx,Seanzie82,4,Mon Apr 20 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"We had a cat get her head stuck in my dad's running shoes once. She got her head out of the shoe, but unfortunately had the lace stuck in her teeth. So the shoe was now chasing her, as far as she could tell.

StartledCats,338xpx,sra502,3,Tue Apr 21 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"pro tip: if you land your mini drone in the cat's water dish and it starts acting fucky, put it in a jar of rice overnight. They don't seem to fry themselves from water, maybe because the voltage is so low.  Edit: apparently rice drying electronics is a myth."
StartledCats,338xpx,DeFex,7,Tue Apr 21 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"Putting an kind of electronic in rice is a bad idea.  At best it absorbs the water on the surface, at worst you fill your device with a bunch of rice dust.  The rice has to touch the water to absorb it, so it's no better than wrapping it in a towel."
StartledCats,338xpx,CaptainUsopp,2,Tue Apr 21 02:14:24 2015 UTC,It is only a $20 toy and the rice has worked twice so far (now i cover the cat bowl)
StartledCats,338xpx,DeFex,2,Tue Apr 21 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"I understand not worrying about a $20 toy, but was it the rice that did it or just letting it sit for a while without using it?"
StartledCats,338xpx,CaptainUsopp,3,Tue Apr 21 02:47:48 2015 UTC,If it happens again ill leave it over the air vent instead. It seems i have fallen for a popular myth.
StartledCats,338xpx,DeFex,2,Tue Apr 21 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty believable myth.  Everything comes with those little packets to absorb moisture, but those are just there to absorb the moisture that's still in the package when it's sealed up, they don't do a good job of pulling moisture out of stuff.    The best advice I've found, if you've gotten something we, is taking the battery out if you can, taking as much of it apart as you can, drying it with paper towels and letting it set to dry, in a sunny window, if you can."
StartledCats,338xpx,CaptainUsopp,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"If you absolutely need to get all the water out of something, you should be able to submerge it in Isopropyl Alcohol briefly without risking damage to plastics, and it won't damage any of the electronics"

StartledCats,338xpx,Gemeye,-1,Tue Apr 21 04:28:29 2015 UTC,"Electronics don't ""fry themselves"" from water, it's just that once water gets in it generally won't ever get out, rice or not, and will stay there forever shorting something. It or minerals deposited by it. Drones are probably designed with that in mind so once they dry out they're back to work."

My one kitten would randomly acquire terrific smells like spoiled milk and 10 day old garbage. My other kitten regularly shat on himself. Baths for them were regular things.  Now that they are grown up, I haven't bathed them in a long time. Unless they roll in something foul, they probably won't need them until they get too old to properly clean themselves."
StartledCats,32lwyi,redpandapaw,3,Wed Apr 15 01:40:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. As kittens they would usually have mom to wash them but since we adopt them separate from mother, they sometimes need help as babies. Healthy adult cats don't need regular washing though, unless they get in something foul or have some sort of skin condition. Or in the rare case of hairless breeds that do need regular washing because their skin gets nasty and oily since there is no hair for it to me moisturizing."

Sometimes they randomly both decide that it is time for CRAZY ANTICS and go absolutely nuts, tearing around and bouncing off walls for like twenty minutes, but that's because they're on some kind of inscrutable cat clock and the timer went off; they don't do it to be assholes.   They also snuggle me and one of them sleeps on my face and the other sleeps on my lap while I work and knit (and only chews the yarn a little bit). So I mean. Cats are pretty great, but they have as much variation in personality as people. If you get them as kittens and make sure they always have someone to socialize with (get a pair if you work a lot) they generally turn out to be sweethearts. :)"

Maybe the big cats have similar rates of harm to their owners - I would suspect it's probably quite a bit higher - the point in that case is that you can't exercise a safe amount of control over the situation (the cat will gut you on a whim and you won't be able to predict it), and from my perspective that's what makes the people who engage in it foolhardy or stupid.

I'm sure that if some dumbass has the balls to play with such animals, it means that he loves doing it and he would not want them to be killed.

I guess I am basing my point on the above video that was posted above, where owning predatory animals has become a status symbol in middle eastern culture, which the guy in the video seems to be from.   But my point is equating skydiving, where unless you hit somebody, you are only risking your own life, is a bad example to compare to owning - unless for rehabilitation purposes- an undomesticated animal that could kill you in an instant and risking that animals life. There's a reason it's illegal to own an apex predator and not illegal to skydive."

It's very similar to the advice given to humans who are threatened by cougars or other wildcats - take up lots of space. You can see it used in play in the gif recently posted to this sub: http://i.imgur.com/ddYyr7Z.gifv  It is also adorable.

I usually put him down at that point, though once I decided to see what would happen.

StartledCats,2ywusb,ARev627,55,Fri Mar 13 18:09:19 2015 UTC,"It would be fun, but unfortunately this and this is how damn near every other cat handles a leash."
StartledCats,2ywusb,uhmerikin,54,Fri Mar 13 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"Cats cannot be walked like dogs.  Don't even think of it as a ""walk"" like you'd normally go on.  Cats don't like to just walk around at a human/dog pace and cover a lot of ground quickly. They like to sit, hide, and observe.  They will get very pissed off if you try to force them to move on your terms.    Cats have to be walked on their own terms.  This means you have to let them control the whole walking experience--or at least make it so they think they are in control.  Let them control the pace of the walk. This usually means ""cat sits still and stares at something for 3 minutes, then moves 6 feet and stares at something else for 8 minutes, then moves 10 feet and stares some more"".  Your job is to keep them safe from cars, people, other animals, and outdoor cats who will sneak up on your cat.  Otherwise, you just let them do their thing.  Honestly, successfully walking a cat is a pretty tedious affair for the human, but if you do it on their terms, the cat will love it.  The more you do it, the more you will trust each other and the more you can push them to cover longer distances.  But the worst thing you can do is try to turn it into a dog walk.  Tip #1:  it is way easier to walk cats when it is dark out.  There is too much going on during the day that will scare a cat who isn't used to it.  If you are gonna try walking your cat, do it at night when it is quiet out.  Tip #2: If you do go out at night, be sure to have some rocks in your pocket.  Cats and other animals love to sneak up on you and your cat."
StartledCats,2ywusb,coryking,15,Fri Mar 13 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"You're spot on, cats do shit on their own terms and it's futile to try to get them to do it any other way really. We have a few cats and we just let them outside in the evenings to play, run around, or do whatever the hell it is cats do. Never tried to really walk one. It would be way too tedious like you said, and well... We just go see if they're ready to come in at bedtime and if they are, they come in. If not, they're actually quite content chilling in the bushes all night. By morning though, they're pretty ready to come in for bites and pets."
StartledCats,2ywusb,uhmerikin,2,Fri Mar 13 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"Spot on, and you know I never saw the need. Cats are really good at walking themselves and they don't need your noisy ass around anyway. I've followed them around at night, that's fun, but it annoyed the shit out of them."

StartledCats,2ywusb,anakmoon,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"That's because the only reason they put up with it was to get outside.  I don't understand this. All my life I've had cats that go outside when they want to. They don't go and murder every bird in sight or any other mayhem. Sometimes they will take the target of opportunity, but mostly they just  cruise. Cats are really good at outside. They take cars seriously, and they are cautious. Much more cautious than I am. If they take out the occasional rodent or stupid bird, most birds are way too smart, oh well. I'm not talking about feral behavior. Feral cats are murderous, but most cats that aren't hungry aren't going to go out of their way to kill things really. So I wonder. Why all the control behavior?   edit:If you want to be with them outside, go with them. Start when they are young and just be there. They get used to it. It's really fun actually. Then you see them as they are."
StartledCats,2ywusb,surfnaked,2,Sat Mar 14 05:00:32 2015 UTC,"For me it was because we were moving around so much. We had lost other cats this way, they just dont come home. When we were stabile and in a place for more than 6 months, thats when i stopped putting her in the harness and just let her out. She has since decided to be an indoor cat on her own, i have to kick her out the door."
StartledCats,2ywusb,anakmoon,2,Sat Mar 14 07:12:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, cats are all about stable, but once they can mark off a territory that doesn't change, they kind of relax. Then after awhile they just get lazy and hang out where they are most happy. You just have to give them that place. It's all about trust.

Just a few candles lit on our small table and we'd finished eating already and were just chatting.  Kitten decided to jump up on the table and explore our empty plates and the candles.  She's on my gf's side, facing me and inhales the entire flame.  I literally saw blue flame go up in her nose.  Poor thing took off like a bat out of hell and she had a hatred for fire from that point on.  Surprisingly she was otherwise okay.  I think we put a little aloe on the tip of her nose, but she didn't burn any whiskers and her sense of smell seemed fine."

StartledCats,2yk9v8,HereForTheFish,-9,Mon May 4 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"Could we have some kind of warning that the cat gets run over?  EDIT: Okay, let's try to stop this clusterfuck. I really wasn't expecting to get downvoted below zero or get 3 responses in an hour to an offhand comment inspired by the rules of the sub we're all in.  I am not trying to censor content, stop anyone from doing anything, claim that I am a victim, or claim that anyone has done anything wrong. The sidebar says 'no animal cruelty' so in light of that, and the trends I have noticed on other animal subs, I asked if there could be a minor content warning so that people who don't expect depictions of animal cruelty wouldn't unexpectedly see a cat being run over. It has absolutely nothing to do with my opinion of the gif, your opinion of the gif, your opinion of triggers, my opinion of you, your opinion of me, free speech, feminism, or whatever else may come up. If you want to have discussions on those topics (outside what you think of me or I think of you, because the answer to both is that I don't care) then there are much better subreddits for that, that aren't devoted to gifs and videos of cats."

StartledCats,2y4qhg,GoodGrades,6,Fri Mar 6 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"Gettier problem:       The Gettier problem is a philosophical question about whether a piece of information that happens to be true but that someone believes for invalid reasons, such as a faulty premise, counts as knowledge. It is named after American philosopher Edmund Gettier, who wrote about the problem in a three-page paper published in 1963, called ""Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?"". The paper refers to the concept of knowledge as justified true belief (JTB), credited to Plato, though Plato argued against this very account of knowledge in the Theaetetus (210a). In the paper, Gettier proposed two scenarios where the three criteria (justification, truth, and belief) seemed to be met, but where the majority of readers would not have felt that the result was knowledge due to the element of luck involved.

For having such a wide range of vision, they get startled very easily. Their reaction to most every scare is to kick. They bite, and it really hurts.

When they're two months and over two pounds they get fixed, then adopted out.    He puts in appropriate toys as they get older.  Little climbers, medium climbers, tall towers. Ball toys, ChickenFish (CF is always there), mice, tunnels, etc.  They start out in a cat condo on the lower level (litter box and food above for mom), and when they can run out faster than he can catch them and they're peeing in the corners, they're usually ready for the room itself, though they're limited for a week or two, then they have the full of what you see.

StartledCats,2tglzm,3itchPlease,11,Sat Jan 24 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"You're good. It would be ""a tiger."" ""An"" is used before words that begin with vowels. An alligator, an eagle, an otter. A tiger, a bear, a dog.  Kind of like in French, ""l'"" vs ""le"" and such. It's a minor mistake."
StartledCats,2tglzm,pbwra,4,Sat Jan 24 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"Sure. Generally words that start with a vowel use the 'an' form of the indefinite article, and words that start with a consonant use the 'a' form. This is the basic rule. However it is actually slightly more complicated than that, it's do to with whether the first letter is stressed or unstressed when it's pronounced.  Examples of the basic rule. Consonant first letters are stressed, vowel first letters are unstressed:   a hotel a list a glass a pillow a beer an aardvark an ear an idiom an orange an understanding   A few examples of exceptions with reversed first letter stress:   an hour a unicorn a university   The basic rule covers most words. You can probably just learn the exceptions by being aware of the stressed/unstressed rule and getting a feel for it through experience."
StartledCats,2tglzm,LinuxLinus,2,Sat Jan 24 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"a hotel   This is actually a gray area; some people use ""an"" before many words that start with H, including this one."
StartledCats,2tglzm,pbwra,3,Wed Jan 28 20:41:53 2015 UTC,"Well it's not that grey. If you observe correct grammar and you pronounce it with an unstressed h, so 'otel' then you say 'an hotel'. If you pronounce it 'hotel' with a stressed 'h' then it's 'a hotel'. That's a fundamental quality of english.   There are of course people and indeed regions who haven't continued to observe all the rules of english and have local changes due to isolation, rules not being passed on, mingling with other languages etc., and that's fine. How I have explained it though is official and technically correct; that's usually considered the best approach to educating a new speaker."
StartledCats,2tglzm,lkuecrar,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"I've never heard anyone say ""an hotel"" or put ""an"" before any word starting with H. Maybe it's just something they do where you live? Or maybe it's something weird about where I live."

I mean sure, you'll get around fine after a while, but you won't have great balance. Whereas if you learn to balance without toes or without a tail and have had generations living that way, you would stabilize a little better. Still not as well as those with tails/toes, though."

StartledCats,2tglzm,devotchkaa,4,Sat Jan 24 09:31:39 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid there was a nest at the top of one of our larger bushes.  My cat was an indoor/outdoor cat so when the time came for the babies to be pushed out of the nest she was ready.  Unfortunately for my cat basically all the adult birds in the neighborhood decided they were going to deal with her.  There was just dozens of birds all swooping down and nipping at my cat.  She seemed terrified and yet at the same time happy.  This is what she lived for.  This was what her whole life was leading up to.  It was an epic battle.  In the end she didn't end up killing any birds, adult or child but she slept very well and contentedly that night.  A few years later she just disappeared.  Perhaps a coyote or raccoon got to her.  That's the danger of being an outdoor cat.  Eventually you will get old and nature has a very particular set of skills.  It will find you, and it will kill you.  Nevertheless I think it's better for cats to be outside.  Yes, it dangerous and they probably won't live as long as an indoor cat but they can live their lives the way they want to out there.  I imagine if you kept humans in a carefully controlled safe environment for their entire lives from birth you might be able to consistently get 100 year lifespans.  But who cares?  What kind of life is that?"

StartledCats,2s1wju,plinking_zombies,23,Sun Jan 11 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly in my experience with cats that would just make them want to eat it even more. If they're playing with something and it hurts them, that just makes them angry at it.   Heck, there's a video out there of a large cat (I think it was a cougar?) killing a porcupine through persistance. First swipe resulted in a lot of sticks but wounded it too much to run away, so it was just a long process of taking swipes and pulling out spines, until it was weak enough to not put up a fight, and it was dragged away to be eaten."

StartledCats,2s1wju,SaggySackBoy,1 point,Sun Jan 11 21:55:15 2015 UTC,It does seem logical. Though even the fact that they're able to follow the same caterpillar for that long and film up close as those larvae eat their way out is amazing to me.
StartledCats,2s1wju,eldmannen,2,Mon Jan 12 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"That is a very good question...I assume microscopic cameras, probably something like what they use for taking video of the inside of your veins.  Also, keep in mind it is a video which may have required multiple parts string together. While we have video of the outside of the caterpillar, it is entirely possible the video of the inside was taken from a different caterpillar which had different conditions better suited for filming inside it."

It can happen in other animals too, some breeds of dog are very prone to growths, but with female rats it's nearly inevitable; if you have several, and they live long enough, at least one will develop a growth.   The upside is that they're usually easily removable, especially if you catch them early. I have eight girls, and so far three have had tumors removed. Two were benign mammary masses, one was a harder, possibly malignant tumor (no testing was done). All three recovered easily and are now in perfect health."

StartledCats,2re9ci,TommBomBadil,6,Mon Jan 5 22:31:34 2015 UTC,Rodents in general rarely contract rabies. Certainly no known cases in the US of a human contracting rabies from a rodent.  One theory is because they would rarely survive an encounter where rabies would be transmitted to them (being savagely bitten by a predator and all).

StartledCats,2ptqcp,UnknownErrorOccurred,2,Sat Dec 20 18:48:16 2014 UTC,"Tortoiseshell cat:       Tortoiseshell describes a coat coloring found almost exclusively in female cats.   Also called Torties for short, they combine two colors other than white, either closely mixed or in large patches.  The colors are often described as red and black, but ""red"" can instead be orange, yellow, or cream  and ""black"" can instead be chocolate, grey, tabby, or blue.  A tortoiseshell cat with the tabby pattern as one of its colors is a Torbie.  ""Tortoiseshell"" is typically reserved for cats with relatively small or no white markings. Those that are largely white with tortoiseshell patches are described as tricolor,  tortoiseshell-and-white (in the United Kingdom), or calico (in Canada and the United States). Tortoiseshell markings appear in many different breeds as well as in non-purebred domestic cats.  This pattern is especially preferred in the Japanese Bobtail breed.

StartledCats,2p54ky,4Meli,13,Sat Dec 13 16:04:21 2014 UTC,"And make sure you have enough money to treat them if there's a medical issue, serious or otherwise. I was a vet assistant for a few years and most people did not realize some types of injuries or illnesses can cost $1000 or more. And most vets won't just bill you, they require money up front. There is pet insurance, I would do a lot of  research on which kind to get though."
StartledCats,2p54ky,bigsnakejake,1 point,Sat Dec 13 16:51:41 2014 UTC,"The way I always thought of it... Yeah you should take care of the minor medical issues and those you can afford. But if what's stopping you from adopting a cat is the fear that something serious and expensive might happen that you can't pay for, I say get one anyway. It's unfortunate, but if it's a life threatening issue you might just have to put it down if it's suffering. You're giving a home to a cat that otherwise probably wouldn't have had one. I say giving a short but comfortable life to a cat is better than an even shorter and uncomfortable life in a shelter!"
StartledCats,2p54ky,positmylife,4,Sat Dec 13 19:57:36 2014 UTC,"I don't think that's a good way to look at it. If you can't afford to take care of a pet, who you're bringing into your life and family, you should not get one. Sometimes shelters charge some adoption fees just to insure that the adoptive ""parents"" can afford the pet. Almost all shelters have a line in the adoption paperwork in which you agree to pay for the pets medical needs and that you are aware of the costs. Unfortunately many breeders and pet stores don't tell people the potential cost. For example, your adopted dog could get an aural hematoma which is quite common. It's not life threatening but it's painful and can reoccur and be very expensive. Or an ear infection, skin conditions, allergies. These are things that are usually not life threatening but can cost as low as $45 (if you go somewhere cheap and you're in and out with cheap medicine that ends up working) to more than a thousand for repeat visits and/or life long issues. Most importantly all of these things can cause your pet a great deal of suffering if not treated fully due to the owner not being able to pay for the vet bills. Sadly I've seen things happen time and time again. Baby animals such as puppies and kittens have all sorts of accidents and are prone to certain diseases. A lot of puppy mill dogs get parvo which can easily cost more than a thousand. My bff's dog broke it's leg badly as a puppy, that cost three thousand to fix. While I agree with your sentiment about it being better to have a good short life than a bad one at the shelter that's not usually how it works.

StartledCats,2p54ky,Free_Blowjobs,1 point,Sun Dec 14 02:33:10 2014 UTC,"If you're ever planning to have kids someday, a cat is like a low level training kit. And cats don't talk back, sneak out late to drink, or go to college. Plus, they only get pregnant if you don't get them fixed. Having a cat is seriously one of the best parts of my life. The room always feels more comfortable when she's curled up napping in it. I always have a cuddle buddy. She does dumb stuff that makes me laugh. I could go on. Her presence is just so simple and comforting."

I identified with the book well, and really enjoyed it. I own very few things from 5th grade, because our landlord decided to throw everything we owned out one day, but I still have this book, even if it is in shit shape now."

StartledCats,2p54ky,Free_Blowjobs,3,Sat Dec 13 16:34:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah, my family went to visit my brother about a 3 hour drive away. A bad storm came in so we decided to stay another day. Came back late the next day the landlord had taken everything we owned and either gave it away to neighbors or had it hauled off to the dump. Even changed the locks. I lost most of what I owned, including contacts to my best friend, because all I had was a picture and a number.  A friend saved our family photos, and I had my Touching Spirit Bear book with me, I was reading it for the second time.  Her justification was she thought we had moved out, which is bullshit. My mom decided not to try any legal action against her for some reason, fuck if I know why. I just knew I was in 5th grade, my dad died not long ago, I just lost everything, AND I lost the contact to my best friend, who to this day I have been unable to find.  My mom has a tendency to let things go, like everything we owned being thrown out. Just a few months ago, she let my fathers old truck, big old thing, needed some work but damn I loved it, she let it get towed off, then took no action to get it back.  It's pissed me off more than once. I'd have taken that truck and either gave it away to someone who knew how to fix it, or fixed it myself, I sure as hell wouldn't have let them just take off with one of the few things my father left behind..."

StartledCats,2p54ky,qwnp,2,Sat Dec 13 19:13:05 2014 UTC,What is it about? It's hard to tell from the title alone.
StartledCats,2p54ky,jokemon,5,Sat Dec 13 19:26:35 2014 UTC,"It's about a boy, well he's 17 if I remember correctly, he has SEVERE anger issues. He's angry at everything, he gets into trouble constantly with the law as well. Finally, after being given several chances, he fucks up again by severely injuring a kid. To get out of going to jail, he pretends to be sorry and is offered a chance through an experimental program. He agrees, and some Native Americans as part of the deal, give him a ton of supplies and build him a cabin on an island.  He is to live there for x amount of time, in the hopes that the grueling wilderness and winter will turn him into a man, a decent person. The island is inhabited by a white bear, the Native Americans call Spirit Bear.  The book follows him on this island, and ALL the mistakes he makes as well as what he does to survive. His anger causes him to do things that just make it harder for him.  It's a fantastic book, he lashes out at everything, but the harsh realities of the island and what he has done to make it even more difficult, brings him to understand just how angry and stupid he is for it.   This is a horrible description, and I hope I didn't give too much away. It may be a young adult book but it is a fantastic book to read. I love survival books, and this one just stuck with me because I had so much anger back then. I still struggle with it, and that book, as well as other books, and movies I use to remind myself to be calm and think before acting.  I think it's a strong book, with a very valuable lesson. Which is likely why it's still seen on kids shelves through today. I honestly didn't know it was still widely used but it seems it's sold in the school book fair or whatever it was called that comes to different elementary schools every year."

StartledCats,2o9uzb,Jay33721,16,Thu Dec 4 21:11:31 2014 UTC,It just goes to show: Lion cubs are simply enormous kittens.
StartledCats,2o9uzb,TjPshine,13,Thu Dec 4 21:37:22 2014 UTC,All big cats really are. And it goes the other way too; My girlfriend and I have a kitty and watch a lot of Attenborough's nature stuff and it's almost terrifying to notice the same movements in our cat when she wants to play as a leopard or tiger when they are hunting.
StartledCats,2o9uzb,FullClockworkOddessy,34,Thu Dec 4 21:51:01 2014 UTC,"We never really domesticated cats, we just made them too small to kill us."
StartledCats,2o9uzb,TjPshine,5,Thu Dec 4 22:01:22 2014 UTC,"That's actually true! In something credible that I either watched or listened to recently I found out that cats (and either rabbits or hamsters, can't remember which) aren't considered 'domesticated' because they retain enough instinct to be able to fend for themselves if dropped in the woods.         Or something like that."
StartledCats,2o9uzb,Jumbojet777,5,Thu Dec 4 22:04:37 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure a lot of dogs could do that too though...
StartledCats,2o9uzb,TjPshine,6,Fri Dec 5 00:14:18 2014 UTC,"Nope! Dogs can be taught to be self sufficient, like a lot of hunting dogs, but they don't know it by instinct."
StartledCats,2o9uzb,tellmeyourstoryman,2,Fri Dec 5 00:21:25 2014 UTC,Late to reply but aren't dog used to hunting and surviving in groups?
StartledCats,2o9uzb,TjPshine,3,Fri Dec 26 18:56:48 2014 UTC,"Well Im not biologist, or anywhere near that, I just watched a documentary thing where they spoke on it briefly. But I'm pretty sure the dogs you're speaking of would be more considered wolves, and not therefore domesticated.       Or if you're talking about retrievers and stuff that we use to hunt, they still have to be taught those skills.         Learned behavior isn't passed through genetics"
StartledCats,2o9uzb,tellmeyourstoryman,1 point,Fri Dec 26 21:20:57 2014 UTC,"What I mean is that I think dog's inability to survive has to do with a lack of social structure with other dogs. This dog wolf ancestory tend to hunt and survive in groups, and likewise if a dog was born into a dog pack that reared them in the wild then they should survive fine.   Feline's on the other hand are more indepedent hunters, though large felines do rely on a social hierachy as well so I'm not sure if my comparison is very valid."

StartledCats,2n77jd,alquicksilver,15,Sun Nov 23 21:56:51 2014 UTC,I think it was the cat's body. Urban rats are really nasty. They'll crawl into houses and bite babies while they sleep. They fear no one and nothing. And look at how fat that rat is.
StartledCats,2n77jd,maybesaydie,3,Sun Nov 23 23:03:11 2014 UTC,The rat was definitely along for the ride.
StartledCats,2n77jd,Moustic,24,Sun Nov 23 23:20:44 2014 UTC,Those cats are right to fear those nasty rats. Rat bites are incredibly dangerous and rats are extremely aggressive. Those cats look pretty well fed and probably have no experience hunting. Rats. Yuck.

StartledCats,2n77jd,Jim808,6,Mon Nov 24 05:35:56 2014 UTC,It's rather interesting to see that domestic cats use the same techniques as their larger brethren. The cat just holds on to the rat's jugular like he was a lion who just finished taking down a gazelle.
StartledCats,2n77jd,whyamisosoftinthemid,2,Mon Nov 24 05:50:45 2014 UTC,"Actually, lions can simply crush a gazelle's spine with their bite.  Smaller cats dealing with large prey will crush windpipes, suffocating the animal."

StartledCats,2kfj4y,Traceyt715,5,Mon Oct 27 03:21:41 2014 UTC,"By ""his bath"" you make it sound like it may be a regular thing. I just want to let you know in hopes you pass it on to your neighbour, baths can be harmful to cats if done regularly! It strips their skin and coat of essential oils and they should only receive baths when they rolled in something dead or some other essential reason. They're actually very good at cleaning themselves :)  Cute picture though, and 24 lbs, that's a big kitty!"

If nothing legit startles my cat, after a while, I swear he just pretends for the sake of running through the house scared.

I didn't really think your cat looked scared. I know the scared cat look, and this just looked like your typical hyper/silly cat look to me. :-)  And I'm not completely close-minded to anything paranormal, but I always rule out every possible normal explanation first. So far have only had a scant few events that didn't turn out to have a mundane explanation. Cheers!   Edit: After re-watching, yeah, if your cat was genuinely freaked out, her eyes would be dilated like crazy. I think she's just having some feline fun."

StartledCats,2jqxrg,inisu,8,Mon Oct 20 06:36:02 2014 UTC,"I often wonder if this is why my cat refuses to acknowledge mirrors. He seriously acts as though they are no different than the wall they are on... I didn't get him until he was at least 8-10 months old so I have no idea how he was brought up before I got him. But I did notice that when he makes a mistake (ie. over/under jumping,  rolling off furniture, etc.) and doesn't decide to blame it on the nearest human, he seems to get embarrassed and will stand near a wall and stare at it and will go hide if I bother him. I'm guessing he had a early life run in with a mirror and it didn't turn out well for his ego."
StartledCats,2jqxrg,DasMuse,2,Mon Oct 20 11:56:46 2014 UTC,"Just so you know, if you ever see your cat pushing his/her head against a wall, it's a potential sign for a number of very serious medical conditions. Here's a little bit more information about it. I realize that when your cat does this it's probably not a big deal and that it's unlikely this will happen but if it does it could save your pet's life."

His only guide on this journey is Al, an observer from his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear.

StartledCats,2gqnue,kingeryck,28,Thu Sep 18 16:36:39 2014 UTC,"I have a theory. When you see two cats angry at each other, they sometimes stand still in an aggressive stance and stare at each other until one backs off and retreats.  I think that staying still like that is essentially a sign of superiority. So when a cat encounters a lizard, they sometimes think that the lizard is doing the same thing. As the lizard is extremely still, it must be incredibly strong.   I may be talking rubbish, but that's how I see it."

Indoor cats require that exercise to burn off the energy. Most owners don't do that, then bitch when their cat has to wake them up when they're burning the energy at 3 AM.  It's very common sense, yet most people don't get it. Amazing.   Play with your pets, folks. Cats aren't statues. They are real animals."

StartledCats,2f64rl,EMPEROR_CLIT_STAB_69,14,Mon Sep 1 19:45:59 2014 UTC,"There's an interesting article I came across awhile ago, On Being the Right Size, which explains why smaller animals are injured less by falls.   For the resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal’s length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force.   http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html"
StartledCats,2f64rl,phileo,6,Mon Sep 1 19:57:09 2014 UTC,What firminator said but w/o air resistance we also get Force = Mass * Acceleration. Every falling body experiences the same acceleration due to gravity therefor smaller masses will experience a smaller force of impact when they make contact with the ground.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

StartledCats,2evrxt,Fun1k,8,Fri Aug 29 13:22:49 2014 UTC,"Mine did that a few months ago. These are normally the most unflappable cats I've ever known. You can do damn near anything to them including kids picking them up and running around yelling, pretending they're footballs, and they just give you a bored look.   The one got her head stuck in a bag, freaked out, started bouncing around the room like flubber, and ripped out most of the nails on one paw. Kept bouncing around the room, freaking out the other cat and spraying blood everywhere. At this point I got there. The (large) den looked like a damn murder scene, and she'd rushed under the couch. When I went to look, the other cat started taking swipes at me and ended up biting the hell out of my hand, then defensive-crapping and spraying everywhere.   So after we got her home from the vet I had to spend several hours cleaning up blood, piss, and crap.   What a fun day that was."

The righting reflex begins to appear at 3–4 weeks of age, and is perfected at 6–7 weeks.  Cats are able to do this because they have an unusually flexible backbone and no functional clavicle (collarbone). The minimum height required for this to occur in most cats (safely) would be around 30 centimetres (12 in). Cats without a tail also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing, and the tail is in fact little used for this feat.

Metronomes and other sounds (such as dropping a metal plate) can seriously freak cats out and cause seizures in some instances.

StartledCats,2ddcdv,StinkybuttMcPoopface,102,Wed Aug 13 02:29:31 2014 UTC,"Animal behaviorist/cat and dog trainer here. No.  A cat having something around it's paw/neck looks more like this or thisthan OP's gif. A cat with something around it's foot/neck would result in the cat pulling, flipping, twisting, biting at the string, ""shutting down""(lying on the ground immobile like it's dying), and rolling around. They don't tense up like that or walk into something that is pulling them. It is dog and cat automatic reaction to pull against something with everything it has, not walk with it.  OP's gif is very typical ""dumb-cat-body"" behavior to something it is scared of or otherwise threatened by(or also the cat might be just tripping dicks like cats do.). Like this,  and this, and particularly the first cat in this. What we're seeing in the gif is simply a cat charging and displaying aggressive behavior at something off-screen that it apparently really dislikes or is way too excited to play with.  EDIT: Before anyone brings up the weird head thing, it's also very normal for cats to do weird shit with their heads when excited in this way. Example  EDIT 2: I feel it's also important to state that you need to not call animal abuse on anything without proof or knowledge on the situation. It makes it harder for real animal abuse to be taken seriously when people cry wolf all the time. Please tread lightly."

There are points when the cat is slipping forward with all four paws planted on the counter, weight shifted back.

The pupils are not dilated, as they should be if the cat is in the aggressive state that you claim. Pupils are always a tell-tale sign. These pupils are normal. Two-year trade schools should have taught you that."
StartledCats,2ddcdv,Random_Link_Roulette,12,Wed Aug 13 14:41:29 2014 UTC,"I suppose it depends on how dilated you mean. Not all cats will have their pupils dilated 100% when in excited play/aggressive mode. This is not a typical amount of dilation, which is why the photo is so striking. Here are a few cats whose eyes are about as dilated or less dilated as the cat in OP's gif that are also exhibiting aggressive behavior.  Titles may not mean much to you, but they certainly mean plenty to those who employ me to interpret their animals body language which leads to fixing behavioral issues. ;)"

StartledCats,2ddcdv,WhitePawn00,0,Wed Aug 13 18:17:32 2014 UTC,This also isn't a gif of a cat being dragged. No matter how much you claim it is.
StartledCats,2ddcdv,StinkybuttMcPoopface,-29,Wed Aug 13 02:49:33 2014 UTC,"Cats being dragged, by neck most likely. After he drops front paws watch then, they. Slide and back feet don't move.    So tired of animal abuse... why, what's the point?   How about I smash their balls with a sledge?"
StartledCats,2ddcdv,Jaxie911,6,Wed Aug 13 03:22:24 2014 UTC,"If the cat was being dragged, it would be attacking the item that was attacking it/biting at it's paw/neck area. It was obviously startled and/or very excited by something it saw. Trust me, cat's aren't subtle about dealing with things that it feels are threatening it. Not to mention you would see more stress on the animals leg, as opposed to it just looking rigid and available to swat at something, like in a typical fight or flight response."
StartledCats,2ddcdv,shadow_control,11,Sat Sep 13 19:04:01 2014 UTC,Not animal abuse.
StartledCats,2ddcdv,dr_rentschler,-11,Wed Aug 13 07:23:28 2014 UTC,"I don't think I believe he's an animal behaviorist. I think a lot of people on Reddit throw titles around so other people take them more seriously.  I mean, another thing we know about cats is that when there is something that frightens them, they puff up their tails and stick it out so they appear more threatening. This cats' tail is between its legs. Something you see when animals are being abused by its owner."
StartledCats,2ddcdv,StinkybuttMcPoopface,10,Wed Aug 13 18:36:36 2014 UTC,Ignore the title. Look at his examples. They're consistent.
StartledCats,2ddcdv,ThePickleAvenger,4,Wed Aug 13 08:13:48 2014 UTC,"Well I can't prove to you that I do what I do, but looking at the examples and using critical thinking is the point.  The tail poofing is not a consistent thing. They don't stick it up like in cartoons except sometimes when initially startled and still assessing the situation. Once the cat thinks it's about to have a confrontation(which is where all of this behavior is coming from), it doesn't want it's sensitive bits exposed, or it's tail to be an easy target. I have no idea why you'd think it was just from human abuse.  Cat fight, all tails are poofy, but down.  Cat yelling at another cat, tails are down.  There are a million more examples of cats acting aggressively with their tails down."
StartledCats,2ddcdv,dr_rentschler,-4,Wed Aug 13 13:58:16 2014 UTC,"I guess that was based off of observation. I have four cats and whenever they are startled, they poof their tail and stick it straight up. I have never seen them put their tail between their legs.   On the other hand, I grew up with a(n) (ex) step-father that abused people & animals, unfortunately. we had a cat and a dog that would put their tails between their legs when they encountered him.   So that's where I got that from..."

It's basically the same extension, but it supports a metric fuckton not to be confused with the Imperial ton more sites and is just generally a better extension (and yes, works with gfycat).  For everyone else: consider this a PSA to any remaining Hover Zoom users."

I tried a Super Soaker, didn't work. I then put Tabasco diluted with water in the Super Soaker, didn't work. Eventually I started to just cover the top with packing tape, sticky side up. That little jerk still jumped up there a few times a day, even with his leg taped to his scrotum quite a few times.   I finally got him to stop jumping on the counters when I found a new home for him. I love cats, but with a baby, I didn't want litter dust and what comes with it risking the hygiene of all my foods.   Miss you Momo, but it had to stop. He is terrorizing a different family now. I visit and laugh at his antics now."

StartledCats,2atyhq,tiffbunny,19,Thu Jul 17 15:29:41 2014 UTC,"God, I feel so many different ways about your comment.   One one hand, you have clear priorities surrounding how you want to protect your child, and you found a new home for the cat, and I commend you for that.   On the other hand, if you shot a super soaker full of water and tabasco at an animal--for whatever reason--I'm really glad that animal isn't living with you anymore for their sake. That is just NOT okay. Tabasco as a repellant is meant to be sprayed on the thing you want to keep cats away from, like a garden area, not on the cat itself.   And if you didn't shoot the cat with these mixtures, why mention putting them in a supersoaker and not on the counter itself?"

The front paws are lifted off of the ground but not out in front of the cat as if they're being pulled. I'm pretty sure that no strings are involved.  The second one, definitely. That cat is not startled at all. Its fur isn't raised and its back isn't arched. When it's walking on its hind legs only the front paws are extended by the string or strings that are being pulled. It is not in a fighting stance when the front paws return to the ground.  This third one is just one really pissed off cat.

StartledCats,2ag9le,aura_enchanted,3,Sat Jul 12 01:09:45 2014 UTC,That serval probably has a better life than you.
StartledCats,2ag9le,reddituserb123,-8,Sun Aug 31 06:20:38 2014 UTC,"You mean it's ""normal"" for a serval to wear a collar and eat cat food? And it's totally not supposed to be them living in their natural habitats.  The only reason we have domesticated pets is a result of man's desire to dominate and control his world. And we have ruined many species who could of developed and evolved and existed just fine without us. But we had to go meddling with natures affairs and now we have pet lizards, fish, amphibians, cats and dogs that are totally incapable or survival without man's direct intervention to make sure they are fed and looked after.  We are bot the world's stewards we can not spend out existence running around Willy nilly making sure every cat, sheep, rattlesnake, bird, chimpanzee, etc, etc is being looked after nor should we. The number of strays in the world clearly shows we are terrible at it if that is the idea.  Instead let's collectively stop trying to cage wild exotic cats, apes, lizards, and so on that are still wild animals and leave nature alone and worry about the damage we have already done and how best to proceed with it from here.  Perhaps this serval does have a ""better life than me"" but at least I'm living the life I was designed too amongst my own kind doing as I please on my terms and following my instincts. Instead of locked up in someone's house with a collar around my kneck playing with a laser pointer. And this should also be the case here.  Leave humans to be human and servals to be servals."

StartledCats,2ag9le,POKEthenTOKE,2,Sat Jul 12 09:05:04 2014 UTC,Cats domesticated themselves too. Also they are definitely not dependant on man for survival.
StartledCats,2ag9le,Alabaz121,-4,Sat Jul 12 09:14:10 2014 UTC,"Wolves are selectively domestic. Many breeds or territories where they currently reside are completely free of domestics.  And even still a domestic wolf is a very different creature from a common golden retriever or a poodle. Their far more territorial, and require many special needs that far exceed a normal dog including diet, exercise, and community. Simply puting a leash on a wolf does not magically turn it into a house pet."
StartledCats,2ag9le,egotripping,2,Sat Jul 12 09:36:08 2014 UTC,I don't think you quite understand how it all works. Stop speaking for the animals when you have no idea what they are thinking. You don't know what they favor.

StartledCats,29yk6q,potowski,18,Sun Jul 6 18:22:12 2014 UTC,"from the comments when i posted this a month ago: http://www.mysuburbanlife.com/2013/01/09/give-it-a-whirl-amur-tiger-returns-to-brookfield-zoo/at8cvl2/  Whirl, a 5-year-old Amur tiger, is back at Brookfield Zoo after a short stay at Minnesota Zoo.  Zookeepers report they are happy to have her back, and she is acclimating well to her old surroundings.  Whirl only has part of her tail because it was injured in September 2007 when her mother, Tiara, tried to pull her and her brother to safety after her brother was attacked by their father, Robeki. The 4-month-old boy cub died while coming out of anesthesia for surgery after his father bit off his foreleg when the cub stuck his paw into the adjoining enclosure.  No one witnessed the attack. The cubs' mother bit on the siblings' tails to try to drag them out of reach.  After the accident and following a U.S. Department of Agriculture citation for inadequate separation of the tigers, the zoo made changes to its housing policies, staffing and training.  Amur tigers are the largest of all cats, with males weighing up to 600 pounds. Brookfield Zoo is part of the Amur Tiger Species Survival Program, a cooperative program between zoos that plans the breeding of this highly endangered species."

StartledCats,29yk6q,uniqueoriginusername,3,Sun Jul 6 16:42:47 2014 UTC,"Background: Her name is Whirl and the place she's in is a zoo.  Story behind the stumpy tail:   Whirl only has part of her tail because it was injured in September 2007 when her mother, Tiara, tried to pull her and her brother to safety after her brother was attacked by their father, Robeki. The 4-month-old boy cub died while coming out of anesthesia for surgery after his father bit off his foreleg when the cub stuck his paw into the adjoining enclosure.  No one witnessed the attack. The cubs' mother bit on the siblings' tails to try to drag them out of reach."

Watch the cat's right ear (closest to the camera). The cat notices the subtle change in sound as the bottle loses balance following the tailswipe. The ear perks up more and turns back as far as possible as the bottle begins to fall more, followed by the cat moving its head to further track this new sound.   Unfortunately, before its head could turn around fully the bottle completely hits the ground, and we get our /r/startedcats giggle rush once again."

StartledCats,29j4lm,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 5 17:39:38 2014 UTC,"Plate tectonics:       Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the Greek: τεκτονικός ""pertaining to building"")  is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motion of Earth's lithosphere. The model builds on the concept of continental drift which was developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. The geoscientific community accepted the theory after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (on Earth, the crust and upper mantle), is broken up into tectonic plates. On Earth, there are seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates. Where plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary; convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually.   Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust. Along convergent boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the globe remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) propose gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.

They don't need moisturizing though, so there's a plus."

StartledCats,27ystc,bamgrinus,11,Thu Jun 12 20:03:52 2014 UTC,"Quirk of ginger cat genetics.    The over-simplified answer is that the gene for orange/red/ginger in cats is tied to the x chromosome.  Male cats, have one x chromosome. If it is red(technical name) you get a shameless opportunity to show my cats as an example.   Females have two X chromosomes.  If they only have one x chromosome and one something else (usually black/gray equivalent of ginger is the example. . . but again we are being simplistic, there is more stuff out there. . .) you get a Calico/Tortoiseshell cat. This is why you rarely see males with this pattern and when you do. . . it usually means they have an extra chromosome and are infertile.   So with this litter assuming this is mom,  she has two x chromosome that are red, that is all she can give on to her babies, ginger fur.  So automatically all of her male children get this trait as they only have one x and it is always from mom.  In the case of this liter, it just means that dad (or dads) was also a ginger.  Daddy red only has one x to give and it is red, so daughters will be either red, or calico/tortie if they get something from mom. . . but in this case, mom is also a ginger.  So you get this lovely litter above.    And as I said this is way over simplified. . .  there is other crazy stuff out there like ""toy tiger"" Toygers. . . so a type of orange and black cat that does exist. . . and is fertile. . .genetics are really weird and really cool."

StartledCats,27sxxv,chegothy,1 point,Wed Jun 11 16:07:02 2014 UTC,"sigh. Seriously. just....look cats don't fully clean themselves, particles can be left on them that needs to be removed. I really wish every video or image of a cat being cleaned wasn't followed by some person posting this sort of response."
StartledCats,27sxxv,QuestionSign,12,Wed Jun 11 04:47:24 2014 UTC,"I've had my cat for 13 years and, though he's an indoor cat, he's never once had a bath. Sure, he's needed some help with some trouble spots over the years, but it's never warranted a full-on bath. My vet remarks on how well groomed he is nearly every time we bring him in, too. I imagine he'll need more help as he gets older, but I can't imagine why I would put him through that kind of traumatic experience unless it was absolutely necessary."
StartledCats,27sxxv,QuestionSign,9,Wed Jun 11 06:47:34 2014 UTC,My cat's 11 and I've never once bathed him. I don't think it's necessary - they groom themselves constantly.
StartledCats,27sxxv,maybesaydie,1 point,Wed Jun 11 08:02:56 2014 UTC,"I never had to bathe my cat until she was 14, and that was just the once."
StartledCats,27sxxv,QuestionSign,8,Sat Jun 14 04:09:43 2014 UTC,"Hey, I fully understand that there are instances in which you need to wash a cat (thick fur, diarrhea, fleas, etc). I was just commenting since the poster indicated it was their ""stray's first bath"". I assume they haven't had the kitten long and wanted to make sure they were aware that cats get different treatment than dogs and babies."
StartledCats,27sxxv,reddog2442,6,Wed Jun 11 05:03:25 2014 UTC,"Trust me, he needed it. The fleas were everywhere.   And I am aware that cats are nothing like dogs...and babies."
StartledCats,27sxxv,Hilarithmetic,1 point,Wed Jun 11 16:14:43 2014 UTC,"Exactly. Kittens and geriatric cats are often pretty fucking terrible at cleaning themselves and often good at making a mess too. My cat had diarrhoea from worms once that took another week (post-worming) to clear up. The mess she'd get in after using the litter box, there was no way I was not giving her a bath. Not only was there visible shit on her, but she also stank to high heaven, even after wiping her down. The only thing that stopped her smelling like she was dragging the litter box around the house was a bath - not cat wipes or a quick groom with a brush -  a bath. Never mind what she doesn't like; if she gets herself in a right old state, I'm not going to just let her wander round looking like that. I wouldn't allow a dog or baby to do it, so I won't let her do it - even if she does have a go at cleaning it, it's still not good enough. If the neighbours or my mum (when she comes around) saw her, they would accuse of me of mistreating her if I just left her like that. Besides, even if she could clean herself relatively efficiently (she's better nowadays), as a matter of health, I still wouldn't feel comfortable with her cleaning herself with her tongue. Day-to-day grime? Sure thing. But actual cat shit? Not a chance.  Obviously, she didn't exactly love the experience. However, she didn't despise it at least. Just wasn't a fan. In the last two years I've had to give her two more actual baths; she's been really good on both occasions -  perhaps that first one got her over the initial shock? I also found that getting the water in her face stresses her out significantly more, so I avoid splashing wherever I can. Getting just her body wet doesn't seem like such a big deal to her. As an alternative to a proper bath (and because I don't think she'll ever be an example of an excellent self-cleaner), every Sunday, I wipe her down gently with warm water and a cloth. I kind of integrate petting into it as well, in order to help her see it as a bonding experience. I'm happy to say she's really grown to enjoy this time we have together; I think it's partially because she knows that I wrap her up in a heated towel afterwards and cuddle her till she falls asleep."

StartledCats,27sxxv,maybesaydie,3,Wed Jun 11 20:16:26 2014 UTC,And they sleep in your bed. You want to sleep with a clean cat. Older cats have trouble washing themselves all over. There are lots of reasons a cat needs to be bathed. They just rarely enjoy it. You have to be very careful they don't get chilled.

StartledCats,27s8vp,Reaven1911,4,Tue Jun 10 15:40:30 2014 UTC,The failure of the metal is a function of both the force applied and the area over which it is applied (sharp teeth apply the same force over a smaller area). You both are correctly describing one half of the relationship. Pressure = force/area.

StartledCats,27krf6,autowikibot,61,Sun Jun 8 04:00:17 2014 UTC,"Ming of Harlem:       Ming was a young tiger, approximately 2 years old, who lived in an apartment on the fifth floor of a large living complex in Harlem, New York in 2003.  His owner, Antoine Yates, had several pets in his home, both normal and exotic. At the same time that he was keeping Ming in one of his bedrooms, he was raising an alligator named “Al” in another bedroom.  Ming's existence became known and reported in the media  when Yates appeared at a nearby hospital emergency room with deep bite marks in his thigh. He claimed that his pet pit bull had bitten him, but the medical personnel were suspicious, because the width of the bite marks suggested an animal with a very large jaw.

StartledCats,27krf6,CubicSatellite,6,Sun Jun 8 15:58:39 2014 UTC,"Aye, and in 2007 a tiger escaped from its enclosure at the San Francisco Zoo and attacked three patrons, killing one. Arguments against dangerous animals being kept captive extend beyond private ownership. But, like with zoos, if they are properly contained and kept, their danger to their owners and anyone else is minimal.  You also have the long list of fatal dog attacks in the United States. Dogs have the potential to be deadly as well, but they can still be kept as pets safely."

It'll be the most awesome way to die ever.  Also, a lot of people seem scared that the tiger will suddenly maul him. Zookeepers are given extensive training on the body language and behavioral cues of the animals they work with. If the tiger in any way seemed the slightest bit irate, instead of timidly curious of the vacuum, this would stop before the tiger even knew he was getting upset.  Kinda like when you know when to stop playing with your cat because he'll start really scratching 'cause he's too into it, except much more in-tune than that.  Confidence also puts animals at ease. The more scared you are, the more nervous they get. Just as true with any cat or dog as it is with a tiger - it's just harder to be confident when the thing you're bluffing can eat you."

It may be performed over a site or substance of particular interest to the animal (e.g. urine or faeces) or may be performed with the neck stretched and the head held high in the air. Flehmen is performed by a wide range of mammals including ungulates and felids. The behaviour facilitates the transfer of pheromones and other scents into the vomeronasal organ located above the roof of the mouth via a duct which exits just behind the front teeth of the animal.

She rides in my lap, in the passenger seat, on top of my subwoofer (behind my seat), or stands on my lap looking out the window. She's safe because if I push her off she goes away and doesn't try to come back for a long while.   She likes car rides  Pics to come."

StartledCats,264p13,minicpst,12,Wed May 21 18:54:05 2014 UTC,I don't really think it worked.
StartledCats,264p13,kingeryck,11,Wed May 21 18:40:05 2014 UTC,Cats often like being in a cage in unfamiliar places as they feel safer. Similar to how some cats will hide under the bed or such when they're scared. Taking her out the cage probably just scared her more.
StartledCats,264p13,Neebat,13,Wed May 21 19:41:43 2014 UTC,"I've done this once (because it's remarkably unsafe to do while driving. The cat is a pissed off projectile with 18 claws).  My cat was terminally ill and I knew she wouldn't be in the car again. She curled up in my lap and purred. Fuck cancer (times two in her case), but my god the memory of love and trust from her... It'll be two years in August she's been gone and I've got a lump in my throat now.   Needless to say, she didn't look like this kitty."

She gets really excited if I open her carrier and loves to get inside because she knows it means a trip.  She also enjoys just being loose in the car and looking around outside.  However, she's apparently one of the few cats that yearns to be outside and is always trying to slip out the door, especially if your hands are full.    On the other hand, my mother has a cat that she literally has to get sedatives from her vet to transport any significant distance."

Zookeepers report they are happy to have her back, and she is acclimating well to her old surroundings.  Whirl only has part of her tail because it was injured in September 2007 when her mother, Tiara, tried to pull her and her brother to safety after her brother was attacked by their father, Robeki. The 4-month-old boy cub died while coming out of anesthesia for surgery after his father bit off his foreleg when the cub stuck his paw into the adjoining enclosure.  No one witnessed the attack. The cubs' mother bit on the siblings' tails to try to drag them out of reach.  After the accident and following a U.S. Department of Agriculture citation for inadequate separation of the tigers, the zoo made changes to its housing policies, staffing and training.  Amur tigers are the largest of all cats, with males weighing up to 600 pounds. Brookfield Zoo is part of the Amur Tiger Species Survival Program, a cooperative program between zoos that plans the breeding of this highly endangered species."

It may be performed over a site or substance of particular interest to the animal (e.g. urine or faeces) or may be performed with the neck stretched and the head held high in the air. Flehmen is performed by a wide range of mammals including ungulates and felids. The behaviour facilitates the transfer of pheromones and other scents into the vomeronasal organ located above the roof of the mouth via a duct which exits just behind the front teeth of the animal.

This big, burly dude comes in, looked like he'd done time and was willing to do more. We exchange pleasantries and small talk before he gets to work. He fires up his cleaner in the bedroom and we hear the longest, loudest scream. It was like some teenage girl at a One Direction concert or something, it was amazing. I come around the corner and see our cat blazing a trail out of the bedroom, scorching earth as she blew by me. The cleaner goes off and he sticks his head out the door and looks at me stone cold, ""Sorry, didn't know the cat was behind the curtains"". Cleaner goes on and he goes right to work. My wife and I laughed about that for an hour. Glad he didn't see us laughing though."

It is believed that the gene responsible for a white coat is also linked to anxiousness, and the gene responsible for the orange coat is associated with friendliness as well. So I think it's very possible that there's a relationship between a black coat and lower anxiety.   The cat in the back probably wasn't close enough to the action to be involved."

It was feral born and already fears loud noises and outside, it prefers the peaceful life and runs away from everything I guess. So even if I put it outside it'd just freak out."
StartledCats,255iy6,Wocketsinmypockets,2,Sat May 10 07:08:47 2014 UTC,"Same for me. The cat (Sammy) stays inside because we live on a tobacco farm, but it is on a busy road. We also have coyotes and a whole host of other random animals that show up on the farm. I grew up with outdoor cats that lasted for years, but they always met their end by getting hit by a car or attacked by a neighbor's dog."
StartledCats,255iy6,kittycatbites,9,Sat May 10 14:17:59 2014 UTC,"Just reading through the responses here, I used to live in Christchurch and had 4 cats. Every cat I have ever owned has been an outside cat. I moved to Australia 3 years ago and there are very few people that see this as a good idea.  In NZ we don't have to worry about predators, whereas here there are possums, snakes, spiders, lizards, dogs etc etc. There are people out there that will steal other peoples cats and then keep them forever, or use them as dog food. There are many, many dangers, along with the threat they are to native wildlife.  One of my cats came with me from NZ and was an outdoor cat, she now strictly lives inside because I know what she was used to does not apply here. She got out once when I lived in the Gold Coast and all she did was sit in a tree and cry until I got her out. She was terrified."

To be frank, there are a lot more assholes out there than in NZ. I am not worried about snakes and spiders or anything like that really, its the people. The people that steal cats, that see them as fair game to do what they want because they are on their property, that will gun it in the car when a cat is crossing the road. You can get fined by local councils also afaik if your cat is caught off your property, which is almost impossible to avoid as any cat owner will know.   If I moved back to NZ, then I would most likely have outdoor cats again, but while I am here, I care about my fur babies too much."

Cats instinctively know how to get home, they also know what is safe/not safe to eat and could just as easily consume harmful poisons in your home (like cleaning products). I personally let my cat outside whenever he likes, mostly because I feel bad when I leave him inside all day. He's fully toilet trained but refuses to use his litter box and prefers to do his business outside.   I'm not saying either way is 100% right, because obviously it depends on the owner/cat, but it's very interesting knowing the reasons behind it :)"

StartledCats,255iy6,dieorlivetrying,23,Sat May 10 00:05:37 2014 UTC,for the first time ever   Is it common for cats to reach adulthood without ever going outside? I grew up in the countryside where the cats we had were rarely inside so this seems completely foreign to me. But then again I don't really know that much about cats so this could be perfectly ordinary for all I know.

StartledCats,255iy6,kolaqube,5,Fri May 9 21:56:34 2014 UTC,The average lifespan of an indoor cat is 12-20 years. The average lifespan of an outdoor cat is 1-5 years.

StartledCats,255iy6,thingsweregood,7,Fri May 9 22:54:59 2014 UTC,"For a source just Google ""outdoor cat life expectancy""; there are numerous, which backs up my claim better than any one particular source.  Yes, your two cats are almost fifteen. Average that with all the young outdoor cats that get attacked by predators/neighborhood pets, and the ones that get hit by cars, and the average drops much lower than cats that do not have those risks.  New Zealand might be different; I know very little about it, however I do know that in American cities the outdoors is no place for a cat. Can they survive outdoors in the city? Sure, cats are very adaptable. But in order to ""survive"" outside, like the thousands of years previous, they only have to live long enough to breed. Plus, for ""thousands of years"" they had time to carve out a niche and adapt to their surroundings. Maybe they've only been mostly ""indoor"" cats for the past 20 years or so (I'd say more like 50...I'm pretty sure indoor cats were common before 1994...), but in that same amount of time the outside environment has changed drastically. Not just with the additions of busy streets and cars, but more stray dogs, diseases such as feline AIDS, and in my area (the southwest) things like snakes and scorpions which have migrated into the cities instead of being secluded in the desert.  I'm not saying it's bad to have an outdoor cat; animals are meant to be outside, and cats are self-domesticated and very autonomous. However, if you admittedly selfishly want your cat to live up to 20+ years (""selfishly"" because cats don't care how long they live; they have no sense of mortality and a vague sense of time in general.), they will on average live longer if you keep them away from as many dangers as possible. The outdoors simply has more dangers, statistically speaking."
StartledCats,255iy6,Mmmmsoil,4,Fri May 9 23:58:03 2014 UTC,"A lot of it is probability.  Cats who go outside are more likely to eat bad things, get attacked, get run over, etc etc...    Just because yours lived to 15 doesn't mean a lot of them do."

Toxic flowers are one example - I know lilies in particular cause kidney failure and even death in cats. It can even happen if they just rub up on them and ingest the pollen while grooming later on.  As far as living in a suburban area...as a kid I once had a cat that went outside and didn't come back for a week...when he did, he was horribly beat up and permanently blind in one eye. We never found out what happened, but we lived in a very suburban area. No matter where you live, the risks will be higher for an indoor/outdoor cat than an entirely indoor one - that's just reality. That said, I don't judge people who let their cats out, I just believe they should try to be aware of the risks."

The advantage of this thing is probably that you can see when your popcorn is ready (with a pot it's more like a lucky guess unless you use a glass lid) and you probably have to pay less attention. But it looks quite big and probably takes a lot of cupboard space.  Since my cupboard space is quite limited, I'd stick to my pot even if they sold this thing where I live. And to be honest, I'd also be to lazy to get it out if I wanted to make popcorn. But I guess it's useful if you're making popcorn with kids; it looks quite safe."

StartledCats,24724l,loondawg,8,Mon Apr 28 17:09:47 2014 UTC,Look carefully. Something unwinds towards the cat after the balloon pops. That's what the cat is reacting to.
StartledCats,24724l,matthileo,11,Mon Apr 28 20:21:06 2014 UTC,Here is my stupid theory: the cat noticed the noise but didn't consider it a threat. It became startled when it realized the object it had been carrying shapeshifted.
StartledCats,24724l,phasers_to_stun,18,Tue Apr 29 02:54:33 2014 UTC,It's the string but I still think the cat is having a delayed reaction to the balloon.
StartledCats,24724l,Langly-,37,Tue Apr 29 04:34:02 2014 UTC,"The gif is actually massively slowed down, the cat was actually moving at 20% the speed of light."

StartledCats,24724l,DArtist51,25,Mon Apr 28 17:50:01 2014 UTC,It's a water balloon. It doesn't pop loudly so it didn't respond to that. It responded to the water reaching its feet.

StartledCats,24724l,0x_,3,Mon Apr 28 20:24:54 2014 UTC,didn't matter until its feet got touched. Than the balloon had gone too far.
StartledCats,24724l,halfgingerchick,2,Mon Apr 28 20:29:51 2014 UTC,Looks like they slowed down the gif the moment the balloon popped to make it seem like it had slower reflexes than it did.

StartledCats,244oal,scarletxrose,7,Mon Apr 28 02:45:08 2014 UTC,"That's because this video is stolen from another YouTube account, Ignoramusky. The guy who makes these DOES choose and make music for the videos. He's a Russian dude with tons if these things, all hilarious. Been around for 6 years, I want to say.  He's a link to a vid on his page. There's one if a cat running in the snow he sound designed with music, pretty funny, but I can't find it."
StartledCats,244oal,dinosquirrel,7,Mon Apr 28 10:14:48 2014 UTC,I've seen this kind of thing before. I think it's just some program used to create the track using pre-recorded samples and he just arranges them to sync with the video.
StartledCats,244oal,bearkin1,3,Mon Apr 28 05:00:56 2014 UTC,"As said above, this is probably using samples, but I think nowadays they do this sort of music (movie scores) on the computer anyway. Yeah it's kind of amazing."
StartledCats,244oal,dr_rentschler,1 point,Mon Apr 28 06:56:52 2014 UTC,"It's basically a constant track. The music doesn't ""change"" exactly, he just raises the track for brass instruments for excitement then lowers it and maybe raises woodwinds for calm."

StartledCats,23va49,Wombatapult,3,Thu Apr 24 18:34:49 2014 UTC,Back in HS I used to have a cat that would play fetch with a wine cork. I'd throw the cork into the kitchen and she's run in at full speed. She would try to stop on the cork but linoleum floors being how they are she would keep sliding straight into the cabinet doors with a big BONK every single time. She seemed to love it though and would bring the cork back each time just to do it all over again. She was probably the coolest cat I ever had but we ended up having to move and get rid of her. Some kitties just have thick domes.

Outside of North America, the pattern is more usually called tortoiseshell-and-white. In the province of Quebec, they are sometimes called chatte d'Espagne (French for '(female) cat of Spain'). Other names include tricolor cat, mi-ke (Japanese for 'triple fur'), and lapjeskat (Dutch for 'patches cat'); calicoes with diluted coloration have been called calimanco or clouded tiger. Occasionally, the tri-color calico coloration is combined with a tabby patterning. This calico patched tabby is called a caliby.

StartledCats,22asuo,nekoningen,11,Sat Apr 5 23:19:50 2014 UTC,Because it's just in someone's kitchen. Is it hidden? Why do you need to record your kitchen all the time? If it was just specifically pointed at the back door or something I would get it.

StartledCats,22asuo,Entropius,5,Sun Apr 6 04:56:26 2014 UTC,"You can often hear the rumbling of an EQ long before the shaking starts, sound travels through air faster than movement through the ground. Source: I live in Christchurch, NZ.  Edit: I'm wrong, thanks Entropius for the explanation."
StartledCats,22asuo,jb_,15,Sat Apr 5 22:44:11 2014 UTC,"sound travels through air faster than movement through the ground.   Actually sound travels through solids faster than air.  The reason why some earthquakes would be audible before you feel them has more to do with the fact you can't perceive all vibrations in the ground even when they're there.    We normally sense P-waves as an earthquake to a lesser degree than for instance the S-waves following them. If an earthquake has not been very strong or we are reasonably far away from its center we will not at all sense the P-waves as an earthquake but only hear the sound induced by them in the air. Still, we may feel the S-waves quite clearly and then other waves which often arrive later, especially at a distance. The reason for this incoherence of sensation is thus found in the different sensitivity of our sensing organs."

StartledCats,21rstd,Old_Monkey,447,Sun Mar 30 20:36:06 2014 UTC,"The series of events seems to be as follows:  1- Mr. Fold on the right has been drinking his milk too quickly and hiccoughs.  2- Mademoiselle White Patches is in the midst of an intense imaginary play session. The mouse is hers, it is dead. She is joyous. Suddenly an unfamiliar squeak slices through her fantasy and she is in an instant startled and on her feet, skidding all over the place to the safety of under the cabinet. She is the type of scaredy cat that will one day end up running away from a bug and into a dangerous predicament.  3- At the same moment Mr. Fold, now confused as to the almost instantaneous hiccough and explosion of movement from just next to him, bolts off screen. His mind is not fully awake to the reality of the escape, but uncontrollable instinct takes him over and he flees. Hopefully this incident has cured his hiccoughs.  4- The three tabbies facing us are visibly confused as to what the commotion is about. The two quick thinkers, Terence and Derrick, dart off to the left at such speed that it is almost impossible to see in exactly which direction they move. Ms. Sleepy in the middle lets out a meagre cry and does the backwards bum shuffle. She knows she's blocked in from all sides, she doesn't have to look. The bum shuffle will save her.  5- Mummy, feeling the sharp rise in tension jumps in from her perch on the windowsill to investigate. Her cute stubby legs prevent her from the dainty entrance she had imagined and she ends up giving Ms. Sleepy an impromptu spanking.  6- Ms. Sleepy is avoiding acid rain while navigating a lava floor, everything she touches is scary, even Mummy doesn't look very inviting anymore. She escapes the play area and doesn't come back for 3 whole hours!  7- Mummy is perplexed. Where's the monster? Where's the danger? She looks around the empty carpet in annoyance. She sometimes wishes her kids weren't such pussies."

StartledCats,20woo9,DoctorSmithOfTardis,9,Thu Mar 20 20:53:34 2014 UTC,The cat ate an Adderall and this video was taken while on the way to the vet. At least that's the explanation that was on the video when it was uploaded a few years ago. The original uploader deleted the video but someone else re-uploaded it here.
StartledCats,20woo9,Intereo,3,Fri Mar 21 02:18:12 2014 UTC,"According to this that's pretty much what a cat on amphetamines will look like. Restless, panting, dilated pupils. I hope the cat's okay."

StartledCats,20myl2,Two-Tone-,28,Mon Mar 17 16:08:02 2014 UTC,"To be fair, that looks incredibly menacing from that angle.   On another note.. Why do some vacuums have lights? Who vacuums in the dark?"
StartledCats,20myl2,EverGlow89,24,Mon Mar 17 18:24:13 2014 UTC,I've always been told it's so that things cast shadows and you can see where they are and vacuum them up.
StartledCats,20myl2,Sorrypenguin0,15,Mon Mar 17 18:29:32 2014 UTC,"As a former vacuum service tech, you shouldn't be vacuuming anything with a shadow. They're for dust and small particles."
StartledCats,20myl2,OfficialCocaColaAMA,11,Mon Mar 17 18:53:13 2014 UTC,That's the sound of the fan housing cracking.
StartledCats,20myl2,OfficialCocaColaAMA,2,Mon Mar 17 20:44:14 2014 UTC,"If a penny gets as far as the fan housing, the vacuum cleaner is already broken beyond repair (unless you call a completely new chassis ""repair"")."
StartledCats,20myl2,Thaliur,5,Mon Mar 17 20:47:06 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily. I don't know much about other brands, but in an Oreck, the penny can easily get to the fan housing without causing any damage to the chassis. It might even get past the fan housing, but that's the place where it can cause the most damage.  I found this video which shows the inside of an Oreck, and I made this diagram to show what I'm talking about. The penny has very little exposure to the outer housing or the baseplate. I've seen very few broken intakes, as they are a lot thicker and stiffer than the other components (it's made to hold the fan housing in place). But the fan housing is meant to pivot around the axis of the fan, and is the point where the airflow makes a sudden turn. A penny could fly into the fan housing, and be kicked by the fan right into that plastic, and cause a fracture.  That's the most common way that I saw Orecks get damaged."
StartledCats,20myl2,OfficialCocaColaAMA,2,Mon Mar 17 22:35:42 2014 UTC,"Wait, does that mean all the dirt passes the fan before it gets caught in the bag?  This is worthy of an /r/CrappyDesign X-Post!"
StartledCats,20myl2,Thaliur,2,Mon Mar 17 23:18:54 2014 UTC,That's how most upright vacuums work. A canister vacuum has the bag or other filtration before the fan and it generally works better. But uprights are easier to use.

StartledCats,20myl2,Sorrypenguin0,2,Sun Mar 30 20:09:49 2014 UTC,"Maybe the opposite, so you can avoid vacuuming up certain things."
StartledCats,20myl2,psychognosis,9,Mon Mar 17 18:54:45 2014 UTC,"I used to be a service tech for Oreck, so I've serviced vacuums identical to the one in the gif hundreds of times.  People would ask us this, and our response was that it was for vacuuming under stuff like a bed or desk. But people didn't seem to care when the bulbs burnt out."
StartledCats,20myl2,OfficialCocaColaAMA,3,Tue Mar 18 09:35:58 2014 UTC,"Let's be honest, you don't vacuum under beds or desks unless your mother is comming to visit."
