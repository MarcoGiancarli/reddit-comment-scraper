logophilia,3e24zw,nrith,5,Tue Jul 21 12:47:45 2015 UTC,I always thought scabs refered specifically to people brought in to work for people striking. As opposed to the people who work there and refuse to strike? I'm not sure.
logophilia,3e24zw,Smgth,2,Wed Jul 22 02:04:12 2015 UTC,"Worked at Albertson's during the strike in 2004. ""SCAB!"" is what they yelled at us.   On a side note, these were the same people who bagged our groceries at Major Market while on strike. The Albertson's closed less than a year later."
logophilia,3e24zw,Bfeezey,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting. I guess it's just a general term for ANY workers breaking a picketline?  But I also assume that precise language use is NOT the priority to angry people yelling things in crowds ;)"
logophilia,3e24zw,Smgth,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"My mom worked through a strike and was called a scab.  She wasn't brought in, she already worked there and stayed with the company 25-30 years after until retirement.  But there aren't many unions in South Carolina so maybe people were confused.  Edit: this was during a late 80s or early 90s strike."
logophilia,3e24zw,ZarquonsFlatTire,2,Wed Jul 22 02:31:27 2015 UTC,"It could just a catchall term, then. I've only seen it used in tv, movies, etc, and it seemed like it was for outside workers, but I could easily be misremembering."

You can only show off your extraordinary vocabulary at the very most perfectly appropriate times.  When that special word really really fits and works without being pretentious or obtuse for the fun of it.  And also not very often.

E.g. the inner product of two directions is a measure of similarity  E.g. north and west have an inner product of zero and are orthogonal.  The inner product of two periodic functions is the integral of their products over a period - e.g. f(x) = sin x and g(x) = sin (2x) end up being ""orthogonal"""
logophilia,3dg8ls,mpaw975,2,Thu Jul 16 01:02:56 2015 UTC,Can be though of as the opposite of diagonal.   Orthogonal is the opposite of parallel.   Two things that are parallel run in the same direction. Two things that are orthogonal are completely not in the same direction.
