bikesgonewild,3e21rw,Valos01,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:32:27 2015 UTC,"as a former ninja 250 owner please do the following:   New tires-those stock ones are awful. A FULL exhaust kit, not just the muffler. LED turn signals/fender eliminator kit"
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,cluecheck,3,Tue Jul 21 14:27:42 2015 UTC,Oh I plan to get new tires. I'm waiting for the rear tire to get in stock on Revzilla. But can you explain why the other stuff?
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,DonSirref,6,Tue Jul 21 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"Exhaust is for sound and a tiny bump in power, LED signals are for visibility, fender eliminator is for looks. Fenders are useful if you ride in rain or mud though.  Personally I wouldn't do anything except the tires. That's a decent amount of money to put into a bike that isn't worth all that much. Unless you plan on riding the 250 for a long time, I'd put the money away for the next bike and/or upgrades for the next bike."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,msmith2222,9,Tue Jul 21 15:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I'm just sticking with new tires. I don't need much more power than what it has now, and if I do I'll just look for it in a new bike!"
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,knightabe,5,Tue Jul 21 15:26:47 2015 UTC,That's a good plan!
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,Algae_farmer,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"safety before aesthetics tires, brakes"
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,Mr_Bignutties,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"yup, stainless steel lines and ebc hh brake pads are enough for these bikes. A galfer rotor too if you feel like dropping money but the stock brakes are awful and never really get much better.  It's a running gag at the tracks I go to that the 250/300s have shit brakes because kawasaki thought it would help riders learn to not bother braking and just go faster into the corners instead (it is shocking how many corners at different tracks can be taken wide open on a 300)"
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,DonSirref,3,Tue Jul 21 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just do the tires.  You are gonna want a 600 soon enough, don't waste money modding a 250 unless you want to track it later."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,Mr_Bignutties,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"Good plan. Do the tires. After you ride it for awhile if you decide you want some different aesthetics, then decide what you like then. Not because some guy told you what he likes."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,DonSirref,5,Tue Jul 21 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. The 250 is a great bike as is, but the best performance upgrade for your money is getting a new bike."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,jordanissport,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, a full exhaust will marginally increase power. It is however, still a 250cc so it can only really increase so much. Not really worth it on lower-displacement bikes other than to increase exhaust volume IMO."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,HaveYouTriedAReboot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:32 2015 UTC,3-5hp makes a big difference when you barely have 30  on a 250 that bump makes it almost even on power with a stock 300 and makes it a much more usable bike on the highways (still not a great highway bike)
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,DrGoose53,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:50 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to squeeze 3-5 more horses out of a 250, you'd ought to just sell up to a 400-500.  It'd be money better spent.  Slamming a full exhaust set on would end up being like $100+ per horse."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,jordanissport,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"there are advantages and disadvantages here  personally I like the class due to how light and flickable the bikes are so a 500 isn't worth it. An rc390 would be worth it if I didn't already have a bike. To me it's more worth it to have the bike I like and make it better.  To most people you're right though, since a full exhaust can't get you to 600cc levels of power or anywhere near that but I have a 600 and want the lightweight bikes to be something different than that. To be fair I track/race my 300 which creates a whole world of bias on how much 3-5 horses are worth within the same class"
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,HaveYouTriedAReboot,0,Tue Jul 21 20:10:10 2015 UTC,uhm...the 250 sounds like a fart box.

bikesgonewild,3e21rw,spongebob_meth,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"A FULL exhaust kit, not just the muffler.    In no way is this mandatory, or even a good idea.  It just makes a sensible bike annoying to ride, and annoying to others.  I wouldn't recommend exhaust unless she wants to dive into carb tuning.  The stock setup has the best rideability."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,Relyks954,0,Tue Jul 21 17:43:05 2015 UTC,So basically become the most invisible thing on the road.  OK
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,dmft91,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:40 2015 UTC,Exhaust doesn't affect visibility... Unless it's a giant fluorescent green muffler.

bikesgonewild,3e21rw,dmft91,14,Tue Jul 21 12:47:42 2015 UTC,I have a jacket! My boyfriend was just teaching me how to ride it in an empty parking lot so I took it a total of 5 ft at the time.
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,filladellfea,-10,Tue Jul 21 12:49:19 2015 UTC,"I'd say get used to wearing it even at times like that. When you're first learning parking lots are one of the most likely places to drop the bike. Also, careful of speed bumps and rain gutters."

bikesgonewild,3e21rw,dmft91,-15,Tue Jul 21 20:26:17 2015 UTC,Recommending to wear a jacket by a single person is now a circle jerk?
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,ridethepiggy,10,Tue Jul 21 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I think you know exactly what I mean.  /r/bikesgonewild is a sub simply for showing of your ride.  Why the fuck does the conversation have to fucking steer towards safety gear?  Save that shit for /r/motorcycles - which is EXACTLY what happened when OP cross-posted this pic there.   This is a sub to talk about her sweet fucking bike - no more, no less; not her lack of wearing a jacket."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,ridethepiggy,-7,Tue Jul 21 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"Because she said it is her first bike. He was giving advice to a new rider, much like others have. She can ignore it if she doesn't want to see it, I just don't understand where ""circlejerk"" evolved from a single comment. The anti-gear circle jerk is getting to be worse at this point, and it doesn't help your cause."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,Babbayagga,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:37 2015 UTC,"Where did I say I was anti-gear?  I just want people to shut the fuck about it - especially in this sub, which is simply for showing of your ride."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,ridethepiggy,8,Tue Jul 21 13:32:38 2015 UTC,"That sole focus on gear and providing zero substance to the conversation is a circle jerk yes.  Always wear a jacket? Really? Even when I'm taking a shit? That's ridiculous. OP isn't a retard, she's an adult and knows the risks associated with riding."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,dmft91,-7,Tue Jul 21 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"Imo the anti-gear circle jerk is even more unbearable. Look at how excited you are over his advice. Like you said, she's and adult, she can ignore or take is advice as she likes. Also, a lot of new riders don't understand the importance of gear until it's too late."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,death2cagers,7,Tue Jul 21 13:25:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not excited. I'm just bored and I sit behind a computer at work.  /u/filladellfea just asked to leave it where it belongs. /r/bikesgonewild is about celebrating the beauty of the bike, not discussing the merits of gear and the choices we make."
bikesgonewild,3e21rw,rsaffi,11,Tue Jul 21 13:26:33 2015 UTC,Exactly! Can we talk about how sweet the bike is?

It is truly an awesome bike, and it rides substantially smoother than I was initially expecting for one of its type/class. I'm 6'1"" so I got the ""extended reach"" option for the Ergo Fit system, and so far it feels perfect. The bike feels almost like a direct extension of me, and it is very comfortable, especially in regards to the seat and pegs position. Overall, I am beyond happy with it. It's a great bike!"

In Wisconsin anyone under 18 has to take the MSF course to be able to get their license. So I signed up for it...then you have to take an online e course before you go in (lame). Then I took the 3 day course over a weekend, next week went into the DMV during my school lunch break, took a 20 question (eaasssy) quiz and got my license! Make sure to bring a parent to the DMV and the slip that MSF gives you. Next step was insurance and I was ready to ride!  Btw all of that costs a lottttt of money in small hidden costs you don't initially consider , especially for a high schooler. So just warning you, it adds up hella fast.

bikesgonewild,3di3t0,BShirtless,6,Thu Jul 16 13:28:55 2015 UTC,"I bought a 500X last spring, and have put over 17,000km on it (still original tires). Man I love this bike, sure it may be a little boring, and not be all that fast, but it'll do anything you ask of it without hesitating.  I've done tons of city riding, two up riding, long highway trips, camping, off road trails, grass/dirt/sand/mud, I ride it day in day out, and she never complains, and get's 70mpg while I'm doing it.  A slip on will give it a bit more excitement. I got a Delkivic and love it."
bikesgonewild,3di3t0,spicy-mayo,2,Thu Jul 16 16:04:24 2015 UTC,So you're saying I made a good choice. I have this fledgling idea to do the Trans America Trail with it...

No issues just wasn't started.   You have to break in a new engine and I had the rpm limit of 4,000 rpm's for the first 500 miles.  First service is very important they go theough the bike and make sure there are no major faults.  They also flush some of your fluids including your oil since metal flakes will be in them because it being brand new and breaking in.   Wasn't able to pick it up tonight so I'm going in the morning.   24 hours without my bike is driving me mad!!!!  Had a few issues as well my front brake not illuminating my brake light.  A fairing issue we'll see if they fixed that.  As well as a transmission misshap that they were unable to recreate.  (I was in fifth last night upshifted to sixth applied some throttle and it went down to fifth gear again...). So hopefully everything is functioning as it should.

bikesgonewild,3ddlto,ImForganMreeman,5,Wed Jul 15 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"Just to explain some of the pics a bit...  • The screen is flashing ""CT COLD"" and the ""COLD"" portion blinks when the Coolant Temperature is below operating temperature (~180°F, but gets up to 210° on hot days ). It also brings the electronic redline down to 6k rpm to protect the engine until its fully warmed up ... then you can play all the way up to 11k rpm (with the Erik Buell Racing ECM).   http://i.imgur.com/fssihvJ.jpg   • Buells get a bad reputation for the odd front brake setup—from personal experience, I think they're great. My first bike, a 2003 Buell XB9R Firebolt, had the Nissin ZTL (Zero Torsional Load) front brake: single six-piston caliper clamping on the 375 mm perimeter wheel-mounted rotor. The 1125 has the ZTL2 setup that ups the piston count to eight and it has loads of bite. The whole theory is with the rotor mounted to the outside rim of the wheel, the braking force doesn't have to go through the wheel spokes and hub so you can make your front wheel lighter (less material needed in the spokes and hub = less unsprung weight). Blah, blah, blah, it simply works for me, and if you want to see an extreme version check out the EBR 1190RS front wheel. I've hopped on friends' CBR600RR, R6, and other sportbikes of the ilk with conventional dual-rotor front brakes:  other than getting used to the initial bite (which I usually have to do switching between bikes, anyway) there's no huge differences. I don't do track days so I can't comment on those super stressful environments (fade after prolonged, hot use), but that can always be remedied by changing up the pad compound to something more appropriate for track use. I use EBC 9261-HH pads for my street endeavors.  You can also see the horn and oil cooler tucked back there. My wheel stripes needs to be redone badly.   http://i.imgur.com/oElHDR1.jpg   • With the airbox taking up the entire area where the gas tank would normally be on traditionally set up bikes, the intake snorkel dives down between the front cylinder and frame/fuel tank, opening up as a mutated Tetris piece right below the headlight. If you don't already know, the hideous/awesome scoops on either side of the frame are the radiators for engine coolant, which are split ... each has a fan that runs for a minute or so after shutting the bike down and sounds either like a jet cooling down or a vacuum cleaner at full tilt, depending on which way you look at it. The XBs had a fan that ran over the rear cylinder after shutdown, so they're noise makers, too.   http://i.imgur.com/1JQ4tOo.jpg   • These are the OEM high bars that came stock on the 2010 (last year made) CR. I replaced the clubman type bars that came stock since my lower back isn't what it used to be—it's a much better, upright position for 6'2"" me. Cell phone (Galaxy S5) holder is a RAM Mount X-Grip but instead of a U-bolt on the bar, I have a RAM mount similar to this in the stock mirror bolt location. Bar end mirrors are cheap Rizoma knock-offs.   http://i.imgur.com/vaHp8qw.jpg   • These three pics are just showing my shoddy Plasti-Dip job, especially where things rub. I needed to prep the panels with isopropyl alcohol and mask better next time. Been fine for about two months now, though.   http://i.imgur.com/3hhfJQs.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/FGTogr8.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/3q9OQbk.jpg   • Big 'ole sprocket. That little tube guy hanging off the passenger peg bracket is the vent for the fuel tank, which loves to spit out burps of joy after a long, hot rides. My pegs are 1"" lower (by Knight Designs) to account for the leg angle.   http://i.imgur.com/Yr2r4CQ.jpg   • I love how the rear brake caliper is hidden by the swingarm. Those twin 2"" exhaust tips are pie-cut and TIG welded in the stock locations, and the muffler is nearly gutted ... it sounds great: not too loud over stock but lets that V-twin burble out.   http://i.imgur.com/j8sx7r.jpg   • A popular mod for the 1125s is to swap in a 2010 model year tail light, which switched it from an incandenscent bulb with a red lens to an LED array with a clear lens. Jardine tidy tail to top it off. The problem with this set up is that the 2010 LED tail light doesn't have a plate light built in underneath like the earlier ones did. A couple of minutes with a rotary tool and some sandpaper and you have a small notch in the stock tail plastic under the LED tail light, and this lets enough light onto the license plate so it's legal, and looks stock, too.   http://i.imgur.com/wtvduag.jpg   • Underneath the stock pillion seat. Just a battery and the OEM tool bag (screwdriver for rebound/compression adj., spanner wrenches for front/rear preload, hex driver for rear compression adj., Torx driver for body panel screws, a couple other little things I'm forgetting).   http://i.imgur.com/yGZmLWt.jpg   • Underneath the aftermarket Baldwin seat, built on the stock seat pan. Another popular 1125 mod is to swap the two Torx seat screws with studs and cotter pins—makes life much easier than folding up the corners of the seat to get access to the screws every time the seat needs to come off.

I don't think it's the brakes that they get shit over it is weird design elements. Like those air intakes look like someone mounted black plastic trumpets on each side.

I couldn't sell my CR for $4500 (or even $4k) last summer. They go for $3500 to $5500 on the east coast all day long."

bikesgonewild,3dapup,Slimy_turtles,7,Wed Jul 15 00:23:23 2015 UTC,They went the wrong way in 2013 though. I liked the 2012 tubular subframe and undertail exhaust.
bikesgonewild,3dapup,YellowCBR,6,Wed Jul 15 02:36:04 2015 UTC,I agree. I love that subframe.
bikesgonewild,3dapup,Slimy_turtles,3,Wed Jul 15 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think that Triumph hit all the marks to make this one hell of a beautifully bike. And on this color scheme, it really shines through. You may not see it, but the white pain has a blue tone under sunlight, aka White Pearl, and the blue frame provides a stunning contrast. The 2011 version, for me, had too many stickers. On this bike, less is more!    I also like the engineering on the new models, especially the multi-part big fairings to make it less expensive, but the lack of under-tail exhaust and a non-open ECU kinda kills it for me.  However, I still lust for the looks of the Ducati 848/1098. Such a stunning bike. I wouldn't trade mine for one of them, but I won't stop staring at them."

bikesgonewild,3dapup,vpr1019,6,Wed Jul 15 01:04:04 2015 UTC,"It's not the same though. When I saw it, I was a bit disappointed. Only the rear sub-frame is painted blue and the fairing is not all white. It's still a good looking bike, but it's not as good as this one, IMO."
bikesgonewild,3dapup,maxt458,3,Wed Jul 15 02:18:59 2015 UTC,I see what you mean. I much prefer the exhaust on these older ones also.

bikesgonewild,3d80uj,PoonSlayingTank,2,Tue Jul 14 11:13:00 2015 UTC,Let me ask you a question; Why would you go for the Yamaha R3 over other light weight sport bikes?
bikesgonewild,3d80uj,BlackVariantOfJesus,5,Tue Jul 14 14:11:11 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's by far the best looking bike in its class. I constantly get compliments from bikers on far nicer bikes. It also has slightly more power than the ninja 300. You're already pushing 9k rpm at 80 in 6th gear on the r3 so the extra 20cc helps. I'm sure you'll enjoy any of the other bikes in its class but for me it was one of those things where as soon as I saw it, I just knew."
bikesgonewild,3d80uj,BlackVariantOfJesus,2,Tue Jul 14 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I didn't want to seem like I was attacking you. What about price? Was is significantly more expensive than the others in its class?"
bikesgonewild,3d80uj,Zippy_Z,3,Tue Jul 14 14:39:58 2015 UTC,The big issue is that the R3 doesn't come with ABS.  I like the R3 besides the plastic on top of the tank and non abs.  Otherwise I would have bought one!  :P enjoy but be careful.  Put 400 miles on my ninja 300 in four days.  Last night had a lifted truck pull out in front of me.  He was about two feet from taking me out and had the nerve to get on his horn...
bikesgonewild,3d80uj,BlackVariantOfJesus,3,Tue Jul 14 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"Not at all! It's absolutely the right question when buying a new bike. For me, it was between the ninja 300 abs and this. Both models are pretty new so you're pretty much only going to be able to get them new. The r3's msrp is $4990 which is fairly low and I paid 6k out the door."
bikesgonewild,3d80uj,legomyeggos,2,Tue Jul 14 14:47:59 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay, for some reason I've been lead to believe that the R3 was significantly more expensive. Thanks for the reply by the way, it's a fucking beautiful machine you've got there, red was definitely the right choice.   Are you going to buy any modifications any time soon?"
bikesgonewild,3d80uj,BlackVariantOfJesus,2,Tue Jul 14 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, it just looks more expensive :) I already installed this fender eliminator (a must): http://smile.amazon.com/Yamaha-YZF-R3-VM-Y310-Fender-Eliminator/dp/B00WZWWTIM?sa-no-redirect=1 and I have some of these red frame sliders on the way: http://www.ebay.com/itm/For-YAMAHA-YZF-R25-YZF-R3-Frame-Sliders-Crash-Protector-/111692456506?var=&hash=item5f9f843644&vti=Color%09Red  Not sure what's next.

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,13489194,13,Mon Jul 13 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, most cities do have ordinance against Urals being driven without such amenities (check your current city for: doggle wearing canine companies clauses).  However this is one of 10 solo bikes made for the 70th anniversary of Ural, and as such came with a wavier."

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,TomekM,15,Mon Jul 13 08:05:24 2015 UTC,"You know I'm glad someone said this, cause I've wanted to say this for a while, Urals aren't unreliable, thier owners are.  New motorcycles are sealed entities, govern nearly entirely electronically, voiding warrant in some cases if you try to fix it yourself.  If you jump on a Ural thinking it's a Honda, you're gonna have a bad time.  They require tinkering, love and a lot more attention than modern bikes.  Read an article some time ago by Mark McArthur-Christie that pretty much sums it up:  ""So when someone takes a pop at ‘unreliable’ Urals from the electrically heated saddle of their new K1600GTL, I’m happy to smile. That’s because I know that if their self-levelling headlight circuit develops a fault, their entire bike’s systems will shut down in self protection and they’ll be trailered home. If my Ural’s headlight fails, as it did a couple of years ago, there are only two options – the bulb or the fuse. Takes two minutes to sort either and get on with riding. I like simple. Simple’s best...."""

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,fake_belmondo,3,Mon Jul 13 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"There's some history here you may not be aware of. I credit the 90's model Ural my 80 year old grandfather bought with keeping his mind sharp all these years.   Every single system on that bike has failed. He's gone through electrical issues, rebuilt multiple engines and gear boxes, and totally given up on the 2wd system due to differential failures. He ended up replacing the engine with an actual BMW because the old one never would run properly or hold oil.   Don't get me wrong, he loves the bike, but the older ones are not the same as the newer ones. Now they come with brembo brakes and all sorts of upgrades. I've seen magazine ads where their bragging point was newly sourced german gears for the transmission that were round. The ad actually brags about the new ones being rounder than the old ones. There's a reason people say they aren't reliable, they have a reputation.   I am super glad the quality appears to be improving though. If I were in the market I would stick to the later models, made in the last 10 years or so. They seem to be a huge improvement over the old ones."

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,ride365,3,Mon Jul 13 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"1942 Molotov M72   the fact that it is in good running condition 73 years is a testament to the prior owners, and manufacture."
bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,tgwill,3,Mon Jul 13 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"I suspect it sat in a Romanian Army reserve/surplus warehouse for most of that time. That said, yeah, it's 73 years old.

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,tgwill,3,Mon Jul 13 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"Right, but it's a Russian made bike from 1942.  Think of all the history that bike had to survive to be even remotely near original, that's 73 years of avoiding water damage, metal oxidation, animals making a home out of part/parts of it.  Not to mention accidents that would of resulted it in being in some landfill.  I don't know maybe it's just me, but I see a bike that old, and I just find it impressive."

Until of course they reach that magical age (teens) where you're irretrievably to uncool to do so.  At which point they'll ask to borrow it.

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,volatile_ant,3,Mon Jul 13 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"Humor was received. However the issue of the sidecar is sort of a double edge sword.  To paraphrase batman:  You either buy a Ural, or have one long enough to want to remove the sidecar.  this comes from the imz-ural.com FAQ board:  Can I detach my sidecar from my Ural and ride it? Technically it is entirely possible to remove the sidecar from a Ural. But you need to understand that the handling dynamics of a two-wheeler and a three-wheeler are completely different and each requires different designs. Ural sidecar models are specifically designed to offer the best sidecar handling.   If you are interested in riding solo, then perhaps you should check out the Solo ST.  Is the Solo sT still available? No, the Solo sT is no longer available."

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,gnargnar211,11,Mon Jul 13 10:42:10 2015 UTC,Image posts should tell an interesting story. Pictures of bikes should be posted in /r/bikesgonewild. Pictures of girls and bikes should be posting in /r/bikesandbabes.

bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,ride365,2,Mon Jul 13 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"That rule is the only thing standing between /r/bikesgonewild and /r/motorcycles.  For people who just want pictures of motorcycles, you have /r/bikesgonewild.  For people who want more than just pictures of motorcycles, you have /r/motorcycles.  For people who want both, you have /r/motorcycles and /r/bikesgonewild.  I am subbed to both because I want both.  Merging them into one sub would all but eliminate the type of content on /r/motorcycles because reddit is biased towards image posts.  It is the only way to keep actual motorcycle discussion posts from being completely drowned out by pictures of motorcycles.  It is the same (and for the same reason) over in /r/cars."
bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,Stivo887,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate what you are saying. But I believe the users of any sub can and should dictate the content, what they want to see, talk about, or find interesting."
bikesgonewild,3d3fwx,Stavcas,3,Mon Jul 13 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, as long as the rules of the sub are followed.  If the users of /r/science started submitting and upvoting science fiction pictures, would that be appropriate?  Do the mods just throw their hands up and say ""well, I guess this is a science fiction sub now""?  Do we allow cat pictures here?  I can all but guarantee cute animal pictures have a wider appeal than motorcycle pictures (comparing the subscription numbers of /r/bikesgonewild and /r/aww and how many upvotes it takes to get to the front page of each is telling).  What do we do when cute animal pictures outnumber motorcycle pictures?  Abandon ship and make a new sub for motorcycle pictures and just bide our time until that one is overrun with memes?  The users of reddit can and should dictate the content they see on their front page.  To do this, they can join or create subreddits tailored to their interests.  If you want to look at pictures of motorcycles all day long, there is a community dedicated to that called /r/bikesgonewild.  If you would rather see motorcycle/gear reviews, articles, build threads, and things that are generally not single pictures of motorcycles, there is a place for that too, and it would be nice if everyone respected that.  If you want both, you can subscribe to both.  Browse /r/all if you want to see what reddit would be like without your particular interests taking precedent over the most common interests.  That is basically what you are arguing for."

bikesgonewild,3d4250,Chiiders,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, coming from a 50cc two-stroke that broke down once a month, it's an awesome bike. It's got that Z800 aggressive look and panels, while being lightweight and very maneuverable.    My daily commute is 30 km, mostly highway, and I'm having no problem keeping up with traffic at 120-135 kph, although at 120 kph you are in 6th at 8.5k rpm.    It has more than enough power to go to jail (in Switzerland, anyways :p) if you really want to get going, and it has enough torque for stop and go traffic (can pull easily from 2.5k / 3k rpm). Fuel economy is seriously awesome, for such a fun bike I'm getting a consistent 3.5 to 3.8 l/100 km, and I'm living in an area with lots of inclines.    I'm currently at 5000 km on the clock, and am unfortunately experiencing some weird noises coming from the bike. Although it still runs perfectly they are quite annoying, so I am planning to bring it to the mechanic to try and fix those.  All in all, great starter bike and great city commuter. At a price of 5800 CHF it's really cheap to buy and I'm confident I made the right choice!"
bikesgonewild,3d4250,Chiiders,2,Mon Jul 13 17:48:27 2015 UTC,I'm loving mine. Just realised we already had a convosation over on /r/motorcycles here  I've just ordered the akrapovic carbon exhaust. :D

First is the availabilty of ABS, the beautiful Kawi green (wasn't available yet when I bought mine), and the stunning Swiss scenery! It's kind of surreal for me to see the little Z with this background because it was developed for emerging markets and I'd never thought they'd sell in Europe. Glad to hear you're enjoying it, don't forget to keep us posted on any mods. Here's a very contrasting pic location-wise of my Z during a visit to an overcrowded Jakarta slum http://imgur.com/aQmDjvH"

Naked bikes are becoming the new ""city sportsbike"" imo as they are more upright and comfortable, and I think more aggressive-looking than supersports. I'm already seeing lots of them here, as they are cheap, reliable (hopefully) and easy to ride for beginners.  ABS is fantastic. On the Swiss equivalent MSF course we tried it and the ""teacher"" couldn't even see it in action it was so fast. In comparison, there was a big scooter and you could really see the wheel locking and unlocking. I've put a pair of Pirelli Diablo Rosso II on it, and it's really hard to lock the front wheel, but it's still nice for that one time when it could save my life.  I see you installed some frame sliders and aftermarket mirrors on yours. Care to tell the make of them? I'm planning to put sliders, and was looking at the GSG ones.  Other than that, stunning bike, easy to ride, cheap as hell to maintain, lightweight, gorgeous looking. I was tempted to buy the black version (mostly because it's really hard to find gear in that dark Kawi green ;) ), but it didn't seem to contrast enough for me.  Ride safe!"

bikesgonewild,3d10af,MotherlessHobo,2,Mon Jul 13 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"Its amazeballs. After riding my KLR for a two month road trip & then jumping back on the FZ, I was laughing like a maniac going down the road. It looks, sounds, & rides sexy, & it just takes off the line so fast compared to everything else.  Its adequate for riding two up, but it seems like my girlfriend gets moved around a bit on it, so when I brake she is pressing up against me & we always have to re-adjust, which I don't find so much on the other bikes. So the Shadow is great for that, as well as throwing on some saddlebags, which I feel just deprive the FZ of its good looks.  I love the FZ, but If you can only have one bike, I might actually go for an NC700x. I'm always wishing I could have a little bit of storage on FZ, which the NC700x has, as well as a near identical styling. But FZ-07 is truly awesome."

S1000XR has the same engine, so buckets of power, but it's really comfortable and keeps the wind off of ya.  I sold the Z1000 because I was developing severe neck pain from the wind as I have to ride the freeway quite often. I think I chose the perfect replacement.  It's so damned good. I'm only 350 miles in but I plan to do a review at about 1000 after the limiter is gone."
bikesgonewild,3d21kg,crackerjam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:44:42 2015 UTC,Can you ride it through the twisties as aggressively as the Z1000?
bikesgonewild,3d21kg,DeerAreOutToGetUs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:21:52 2015 UTC,"Not enough saddle time yet to be definitive however, on just initial impressions with everything set in dynamic mode I feel more confident on the S1000xr."
bikesgonewild,3d21kg,DeerAreOutToGetUs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"I would say it compares, as you have the DDC on the XR, and can set it to hard, and with all the electronics onboard, it might give the Z1000 a run for its money. If it compares to the R, then it should beat it, as in all the comparison videos on youtube, the S1000R and Duke 1290R take all the cakes."
bikesgonewild,3d21kg,DeerAreOutToGetUs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:25:56 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I can't say for certain as its still limited for break in but I feel as if it would smoke the z1000.  So much electronic assistance.

bikesgonewild,3d157p,beercat18,4,Sun Jul 12 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"I have the 2014 as well. I did a couple of mods to make it more faster and efficient.    O2 Mod - This will make commuting easier as it cuts out all the bucking around in lower RPMs. Ships from Australia.  Change the sprockets and get 15-42 ( this is what the 690 SMC comes with) and makes shifting easier. You can use the same stock chain  straight pipe - the cat is really heavy you might want to change this out. I recommend fresco. Company is based out of france. The straight pipe costs about $120  If you have the money get an Akra can. Otherwise leo vince.  DNA stage 1 and Stage 2 filter.  Only if you have straight pipe get a Akrapovic map. Usually all the KTM dealers have this.    Edit: forgot to Add , change the rearsets and replace with R rearsets. Definitely more control over the bike over all."
bikesgonewild,3d157p,Hyperbole13,2,Mon Jul 13 20:18:52 2015 UTC,This is good info. I've thought about starting to dabble in the exhaust and mapping but haven't touched it yet.

bikesgonewild,3d157p,porrridge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"I can second this, I've done all the same mods myself and it really turns the bike into a beast. O2 mod + sprockets are a must, do this straight away.  The fresco decat is quite cheap I have this myself paired with a second hand akra can. You can sometimes find cheap combos on ebay for a slipon + decat. Search for Arrow, GPR or Leo Vince. The sound with the cam + decat is amazing.   I don't have the R rearsets myself, I will look into them."

bikesgonewild,3d157p,Charalzo,4,Mon Jul 13 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah as u/STFUDora said, just keep tabs on the oil. Mine doesn't burn it too bad but I do occasionally have to add a little bit to the ol' thumper.  Also you'll get a lot of oil/chain lube fling from the chain onto the casing and catalytic converter (or whatever is the section of exhaust beneath the bike is). First day I rode it I thought maybe I had a leak or something but it's just from the chain.  Other than that just enjoy it! As you can see I started ripping off ugly stock stuff pretty much the day I bought it. Taking the mirrors and rear fender/plate mount really cleaned it up a lot  Edit:spacing"
bikesgonewild,3d157p,montyzac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:09:18 2015 UTC,Sweet I'll definitely keep an eye on that oil then. Ya rear fender eliminator is pretty high on my priority list how hard was that mod?
bikesgonewild,3d157p,STFUDora,2,Mon Jul 13 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was the first thing I did to the bike. It wasn't too bad to change out. Couple bolts, unhook your wires, bolt up and reconnect. Took a little time, but it wasn't too difficult.  Definitely worth it. The one that I purchased was from the PowerParts catalog and looks like this:  http://imgur.com/xwpiFc2"

bikesgonewild,3d157p,Given_to_the_rising,2,Mon Jul 13 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"I just thought of this, and it's the most aggravating part about the Duke...the lever for the foot brake is WAY too high. The same goes for the shifter but you can adjust the shifter down.  The brake only adjusts so far and even with it as low as it can go it is still too high.  I took the foot peg brackets off and flipped them over, which gave me a little more height in the peg, but they're still too low compared to the brake pedal. I've heard buying the ""R"" race pegs solves this problem but I have not purchased them yet."

bikesgonewild,3czbrw,dlnsaul,6,Sun Jul 12 03:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah vrods!   I got one after riding around a 800cc metric cruiser for years and I remember the fucking insane look on my face as I exploded it through the twisties.  Specifically remember saying inside my helmet 'I am a speed wizard'.   Advice : you will probably get restless and want a new exhaust.  Resist the urge to go slip-on.  (tho if you can't and wanna try them out pm me.  I have a set of black slash cut slip ons close to new that I'd sell ya on the cheap!) They sound cooler but are all terrible and cripple the bike even with a good tune.  Go 2 into 1 and GET.  IT.  DYNOD.  These bikes are a nightmare to try to tune without the proper equipment /expertise.  I seriously rode around with a laptop hooked to my tuner in a backpack pulling over every quarter mile to try to get the tune right for multiple days in a row and still never really came close to what a real deal dynotune did for the performance.   They are fickle and they need backpressure, but because it's a Harley a ton of the parts follow the classic hd straight pipe philosophy and miss the mark entirely of what this bike is.  I went akrapovic but the vh kit is supposed to be great as well.   Enjoy that shit man!  She's a beast!   edit -  1130cc.com is a great resource but it will make you want to spend millions on your bike when you see some of the wild shit people do to them"
bikesgonewild,3czbrw,cacophonousdrunkard,2,Sun Jul 12 13:13:06 2015 UTC,That's because you need to tune each cylinder individually like it's a separate engine and balance them together. There's absolutely no way to do any tuning (let alone tune both cylinders) without a dyno.

bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,bnooks,2,Sat Jul 11 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"It honestly depends on a few factors. (If you are in the US) IF you have taken the msf safety course, age, how many accidents or tickets you have on record, if you apply for multiple vehicle discounts etc.   I bought a CBR1000RR when I was 18, had my parents insure it because for them it was 1400/ year but for me.. it was 8600/year with no tickets and a clean record."
bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,redditorrrrrrrrrrrr,4,Sat Jul 11 16:29:18 2015 UTC,It's legal to get a 1000cc at 18 in the states? Damn.  I can only go upto 400 here until I'm 21.
bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,Ravenman2423,2,Sat Jul 11 16:55:39 2015 UTC,Yes. In the states as long as you have your motorcycle endorsment you can ride any size. My first bike was a 500CC when I was 16
bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,redditorrrrrrrrrrrr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:01:36 2015 UTC,as long as you have your motorcycle endorsment you can ride any size.    What do you mean by that? What are motorcycle endorsements?
bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,Ravenman2423,3,Sat Jul 11 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"Just a letter ""M"" on your driver's license.  Means you've passed a written and road test (or safety class in some states).  In my state if you pass the written test (12/16 questions correct) you get your learner permit which allows you to throw on a helmet and ride any bike you want for like a month.  To complete the license you have to pass an MSF class.  You pass that and go to the DMV and sit in line for many hours and that + your passing the written test = license to ride whatever bike you want with or without a helmet."
bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,wtfxstfu,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool.  I'd have thought that there be some kinda cc limit though. I ride a 200 because it's the only thing I could afford (cost me about $5k. A 1000cc would have been a good $25k at least over here.) but still, the thought of being limited kinda sucks.  But 21 is only a few years away so whatever.  And it's not like I'll have the money for a new bike by then anyway haha"
bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,Ravenman2423,2,Sat Jul 11 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"On our drivers license we have a spot called endorsement, you can get endorsements for things like motorcycles and farm vehicles.

bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,Stivo887,2,Sun Jul 12 00:25:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on age, history, etc..  FWIW I looked into it a year or two ago and it would have cost me almost exactly the same amount as my 636 did (which was about 2.6x what a 300 cost).  S1000s being less common (therefore less wrecked/stolen) basically made up for the difference in engine size."
bikesgonewild,3cx9uc,wtfxstfu,2,Sat Jul 11 17:17:08 2015 UTC,"Insurance will only be that high if you're under 25. They were quoting me something stupid like 300 a month to insure a 2012 R1 (I was 22 at the time) once i hit 25, my insurance took a nose dive to a little over 300 a year for my 2014. I'm in the market for a 2015 R1 and my premium would only go up by $20."

I've put about 2k miles on the bike and I'm not sure it's something I would have bought.  Granted, I don't know what the original seat feels like, but with the Corbin, it feels like I slide towards the gas tank way too often.  Causes me to squish a certain sensitive area in lower stomach area.    I have heard of people putting a couple of extra washers undereath the area where the seat locks in near the tank, which basically would raise that area of the seat, not allowing you to slide into it.

We then need to pay for a Certificate of Entitlement to own the vehicle for 10 years, after which the vehicle has to be scrapped unless the COE is renewed again. The current COE for motorcycles is SGD 6,500. Which is crazy because even 200cc motorcycles can cost over SGD 20,000!"

Their power plants are near Bulletproof, they are american made, and more affordable than some other american brands.  I own one so maybe I'm biased but what isn't great about a Victory?"
bikesgonewild,3ctgcf,FuelAirSpark,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"what isn't great about a Victory?    For me it's the aesthetics.  I think maybe it's just the faux authenticity of the cruiser market as a whole that sours my view, but I also think their design philosophy isn't that great.  It's generally a hark back to old fashioned designs, mixed with this contradictory desire to be more modern, resulting in a sort of neither-here-nor-there embodiment of clashing intentions that has no individual merit. Instead of pushing boundaries, it just becomes a reflection of contradicting goals and tired design tropes.  No matter how ""radical"" victory go, I always feel like I saw it all 10 years ago on re-run episodes of American Chopper.  They are to be commended for honing ergonomics, handling and reliability. Those are the basic elements of any good motorcycle. I just personally think they need to fire their design team. :P"

bikesgonewild,3cqz24,roaddog7701,5,Fri Jul 10 13:55:42 2015 UTC,"i don't hate on them, but I don't like them.  1) They are overpriced for the technology (don't even mention accessories)  2) Most Harley riders I've met are very cliquish and have the (negative) group mentality. Look at their stance on gear and you're are another way to call a cat a kitty if you gear up. Also the side by side riding gets to me - cool over safety right?  3) Most Harley riders I've met are more interested in stopping and drinking rather than riding.  This does not apply to all riders, I have friends who own Harleys that are very nice people. Unfortunately, just like most people who think sportbike riders are squids, there is a certain amount of truth to the stereotype.  edit: spelling/formatting"
bikesgonewild,3cqz24,kwebber321,3,Fri Jul 10 11:27:42 2015 UTC,"Same here. I don't dislike Harley's it's the herd mentality of some of the riders. Like when their sitting outside a bar next to their glides and roadkings and a ZedX 10 or a R1 rides by and their like ""get a man's bike"". ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? those said bikes have King Kong engines compared to a Harleys. I do appreciate their aesthetics, but when it comes to performance & tech they're near on the bottom among ALL moto manufacturers. To the OP, It's a beautiful mean looking bike and they have gobs upon gobs of torque. Enjoy."

bikesgonewild,3cs237,Knuda,2,Fri Jul 10 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember that wrist ache when I had the cbr600rr and RS125.  Modern street legal sports bike design is frankly retarded. You're supposed to hold yourself up with your core muscles and not put any weight on your wrists, but the seat slopes forward and down which makes that even harder so you kinda have to prop yourself up with your legs so as to avoid ruining your wrists while simultaneously crushing your balls into the tank. It's all uncomfortable as shit. Fast and powerful, but uncomfortable.  If you go ride an old, like early 90's late 80's sports, they're much more ergonomically sensible. An early cbr400 is one of the easiest comfiest bikes you'll ever ride in the sports category, and they're crazy easy to get it low on a corner. So much more fun, and the retro factor give it a charm that these new bikes just don't have."
bikesgonewild,3cs237,Towlybear,2,Sat Jul 11 03:15:30 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I think from about 2003/04 manufacturers decided to build an out and out race bike then stick on lights and anything to make it road legal - fuck the commuters!

bikesgonewild,3cqydx,st3ph3n,5,Fri Jul 10 05:02:38 2015 UTC,"Just from looking at the photo:  It's a relatively modern harley engine in a stock frame, the shock absorber mounting point has been moved back to lower the rear end, the front end has been kept more or less stock. Solid disc rear wheel cover conversion, looks like an off-the-shelf short sporty type tank, triple tree mounted bars, mid controls, probably a custom seat, reasonably tall sissy bar, off-the-shelf custom pipes, looks like it might be a stock CV carb on there which I guess would make it an evo sporty engine judging by the cases, nice air filter, bobbed out rear fender, coker tires...  And it's blue with ebay pinstripe decals. :P  Also the owner should probably go ahead and take off the push throttle cable. Would be a little less front end clutter."
bikesgonewild,3cqydx,ZombieOmNom,5,Fri Jul 10 07:35:14 2015 UTC,"Not too far off. It's an '04 Sporty Custom, which is the first year of the rubber mount. Stock frame, stock motor. I cut the fender struts off to bob the fender, which is off a Sportster Hugger I think. Pipes are modified stock, seat is my own. Sissy is a modified trident off a 70's Ironhead chop. Bars are Zombie Performance H-Bars narrowed a few more inches. Rear wheel is the stock solid unit, not a cover. Tank is a narrowed, frisco'd Sporty peanut, and the pin-striping is real. It's a total budget build, done in a one car garage with basic hand tools and a little tenacity. I have done over 25,000 miles on it, including EDR, LA to Portland, Portland to San Diego and many other thousand + mile trips. I just started my biggest trip yet. Cross country to the Brooklyn Invitational. These last few days I did South Orange County to Bellingham Washington via Las Vegas and Yosemite."

bikesgonewild,3coxje,DorkSidedStuff,4,Thu Jul 9 19:51:58 2015 UTC,Not op but can answer this. I switched from an r6 to my 1200 sportster. The acceleration is there. I defently beat most my friends off the line. Speed? Who needs to go much faster then 120. The bike is bigger and isn't as nimble but it's probably not as bad as you would think. I love it but I do plan on getting another r6.  Edit: if intrested tomarrow I'm uploading a motovlog on YouTube where I race my buddy a couple times and beat him every time. The last race in the video he starts to catch up and is about to pass me but we hit a red light.  Edit #2: that video this is my second moto vlog still getting the hang of things.

bikesgonewild,3coxje,nominally,2,Thu Jul 9 20:48:42 2015 UTC,How about comfort? Is it more smooth at highway speeds?
bikesgonewild,3coxje,iwheeljeepxj,2,Thu Jul 9 21:12:35 2015 UTC,To be honest. It's terible for a harley. Better then a sport bike. You can always buy a better seat. But the problem is in the shocks. You either set it up for when you ride solo and then it's too soft when you have a passenger and you rub/bottom out when hitting bumps. Or you set it up for a passenger then you feel ever bump when riding alone. If you have a spanner wrench then you can just adjust it for the application. Or just buy new shocks. For the long hauls I never have any problems. I only have to stop for gas about every 150 miles. On a sport bike you are always hunched over resting on your palms. With the wind in your face. On the sportster you are in a more sitting position. Without a windshield I feel as if I'm constantly holding on the handle bars while the wind tries to blow me away. But if I know I'm going on a long ride I throw the detachable windscreen on and that helps a whole lot.

bikesgonewild,3cozs2,xCoolHwipx,2,Thu Jul 9 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"Hey, I am rebuilding an 81 kz750.  What are you doing to yours?"
bikesgonewild,3cozs2,rocknerd,2,Thu Jul 9 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"Luckily I bought it running and with a bunch of work already done to it. Had...  -Keihin cr special carbs -Dyna coils/ignition -An unknown aluminum swingman that I'm guessing is stretched about 4"" longer than the factory one.  -Kerker exhaust.  -Rebuilt motor I'm thinking cause it has 28k miles on it and looks to have new cylinder gaskets. I just ran a cold compression test on it and got 150psi across all four cylinders give or take a few psi which is fairly high so maybe higher compression build? -Woodcraft clipons. -Corbin seat that has a cafe look to it but kinda bulky.  I got it home and tore in to it redoing some lazy wiring/soldering joints and removing unneeded wiring/switches like the brake light failure switch, headlight reserve lighting unit, etc. So far I've installed a bunch of parts from an 09+ ZX6R including the rear sets, clutch/brake controls, left hand turn/headlight control unit. Put an integrated led taillight under the seat from a Yamaha r6. Cut off a bunch of tabs/brackets. Removed the big factory gauges and installed a Koso multi gauge. Stainless brake lines. K&N pod filters since it just had velocity stacks on it. Also have some APE goodies to install.   Supposed to drop it off this weekend to get the carbs synced and jetted as it seems like it's running pretty rich at idle and I want to be able to ditch the starter and go kicker only. Then it should be ready to ride until this winter when I tear it back apart to build a seat pan, relocate the battery and associated wiring, and get the frame cleaned up and powder coated. Eventually swap to a newer inverted front end and mono shock the rear.  Sorry for the formatting. I'm on my phone. I'll try to get pics later. What are you doing with your kz??"
bikesgonewild,3cozs2,xCoolHwipx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"I am not doing anything nearly as involved as you.   I had a non-running basket case so I did a full strip down, got the head sandblasted, new valves, doing a full gasket set on the motor, stripped the frame down, got rid of the seat - have to get fabricating a new seat pan.  I was going to go with clip ons but as I am very tall the clipons would be a bit low so I simply flipped the existing handlebars.  It gave the look I wanted without bashing into my knees.  I have a new exhaust - basically a stock 4 - 2 with turn outs.  I am keeping the air box as I have no idea what I am doing with carbs so I figured keeping it stock would be beneficial.    When it comes to wiring I am a little stunned.  So I was just going to keep the stock harness and later on if I feel so inclined I will try and rewire it but that is a little bit down the road.  My next step is to get the engine back into the frame.  As for the rear sets I was just going to keep it pretty low key and see what works after I get the engine running.    I am going to go with stainless brake lines, a GPS speedometer, and matching tach.  As for the idiot lights I really don't like the stock piece of plastic crap so I am going to attempt to make an LED strip with indicator lights, oil, fuel, and neutral finder.  Again by keeping the stock wiring harness everything is already set up."
bikesgonewild,3cozs2,rocknerd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the main thing with the carbs is to not change a lot at one time. I found a colored wiring diagram for mine. I've actually gone through in the past in paint and colored wiring diagrams to help follow them easier. Makes reading them a breeze.    The gauge I got is pretty versatile. It's the Koso t and t. It has an analog tach, digital speedo, fuel gauge, odo, idiot lights, all in one package. Compact and much cleaner."

bikesgonewild,3cozs2,rocknerd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:21:31 2015 UTC,Koso is definitely with a look. I looked at several different brands and I'm pretty happy with it so far. I don't have any actual miles on it but it's legible out in the sun and seems well built. Good luck with the build!

My father has a bike shop, the frame was straight, just a few scrapes on the left side fairings and tail. I had the bike painted shortly after, here's a pic, I hated the flames and couldn't afford another custom paint job so i changed it myself a couple years ago to what you see today. I dropped it once since then, on the track, but it was after the new revisions. Frame is a bit bent now, it'll eventually be a track bike. Looks like I'm going to be keeping this one for a while."

When i got on my 2nd bike which was a 2003 bike, it felt like switching to a bicycle.  Honestly the sketchiness of that zx7 made me a far better rider when i got on a lighter, newer bike.  It also taught me A LOT about bike maintenance.  Well done hanging on to that bike for so long and keeping it looking the way it does!"

I had a VFR for touring and commuting on the straight boring stuff, but decided the SV650 was comfortable enough to do some touring on.

bikesgonewild,3cklto,ToxyFlog,2,Wed Jul 8 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"Further back was actually harder since the exhaust rises, but it worked best with the dog carrier.
