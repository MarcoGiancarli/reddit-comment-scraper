vegan,3e1tun,node_ue,12,Tue Jul 21 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"I would love to hear your transition story, or your omnivore perspective of the cattle ranch with added hindsight. Is this somewhere already?"
vegan,3e1tun,happy_herbivore,18,Tue Jul 21 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"Okay. So, growing up, my dad was a prison guard, but his hobby/passion was cattle. And so my dad had a herd(s) on some property roughly 18 miles outside of town. There wasn't enough land to provide sufficient grazing, so every day my brother and/or I would go with him to transport hay. He would drive, and we'd do all the grunt work. But my father died unexpectedly when I was 16, and we subsequently sold off all his cattle.  My brother and I also did 4-H from age 8-18, where we'd raise/train a heifer or steer and show/sell it at the fair. Every year a new animal to befriend. Most were steers and, thus, would be killed after 10 months of training them and prepping them for the fair.  And of course we had all sorts of pets around the house.  I've always been fascinated by animals. These are creatures with other minds and other experiences, and they surround us from their different perspectives.  In college, I was jumping from major to major. Started as an aerospace engineer. Then history. Then English. Finally, philosophy. I grew very fond of ethics, and I eventually found myself exploring non-human ethics, concerning robots, the environment, and non-human animals. Meanwhile, I had two vegan roommates, who piqued my curiosity.  I spent a month or two looking at what ethicists thought of veganism, and, nearly unanimously, they support it. There really aren't any good arguments for eating meat. And so I started my transition into veganism.    As far as my hindsight on the cattle industry goes, it's a weird feeling that now, as a vegan, I have farmer friends whom I can't support anymore. We had rancher friends who were like a second family to me.  I have mixed feelings about the ranch experience.  On the one hand, cows (female) and breeder bulls appear to live decent lives. They lazily lie around, socialize, and chew their cud.   On the other hand, we do subject ranch cattle to a lot of harm. All cattle get branded. Most get ear-tagged. And, when you cull any individuals from the herd, they're like in prison, and certain friends/family will come to visit. Kicking/punching/twisting tails to get them through the corral is normal. Dehorning is bloody.  I remember one day when we were neutering bull calves. Normally, for young ones, it's done with a Swiss army knife. Older ones get a tight rubber band around the testicles to cut off circulation. On this day, rather than being squeezed tightly in a corral ""squeeze chute"", the little calves were allowed to run in a pen but were then roped and tackled to the ground. Once tackled by 3-4 people, they were held still, branded with a hot branding iron, then neutered with a Swiss army knife. Often the person would need to reach into the body cavity to search for a missing testicle to yank out. Once neutered, the young bull steer would be rushed off to the next pen. On this particular day, we were keeping the testicles, and it was my job to carry the ""nut bucket"". And I remember, after a couple dozen babies, the bucket got too heavy for me to carry. And of course it was a big bucket o' gore. I don't want to subject any creature to that sort of pain.  On another neutering occasion, we weren't keeping the testicles. So we had a ""snowball fight"" with the removed scrotums. Initially I was grossed out, but I relaxed after being allowed to smush the contents of one into another person's face. Ewww....  I guess, on an average day, a ranch cow has a decent life, but we inflict a lot of harm on them on non-average days. And I haven't even been to a slaughterhouse.  And apparently ranch cattle are a very small minority compared to feedlot cattle, whom I don't have much experience with. During the very limited time I've spent at feedlots, they've seemed like pretty desolate places.  So.... for me it's complicated....but I like to see animals respected, and I didn't see that in any of my experience. Sure, ranchers care about their animals, but apparently only when it coincides or doesn't conflict with profit.  But I don't like to think of myself as anti-rancher. These were decent people. I think of myself as pro-cow instead."
vegan,3e1tun,yo_soy_soja,7,Tue Jul 21 13:24:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, and 4-H/FFA have some pretty rough methods of dealing with uncooperative cattle. Cattle have sensitive noses, and it's normal to repeatedly punch them in the nose if they're ""acting up"". And if an animal resists going in the direction you want to take it in, standard procedure is to take its tail and yank it in the direction you want it to go. Usually this takes several yanks before the cow bursts forward in pain."
vegan,3e1tun,yo_soy_soja,6,Tue Jul 21 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"Shit man, that's hard to read. I wish I could like dump everything I've read or seen on others and have them know what I know instantly.  Also, shout out to another ethical philosopher. I studied it as a minor, but like you, I kinda liked it more than anything else I was learning. Peter Singer is really a boss, and its a shame more people aren't listening to him. It's really kinda crazy to me that the field has basically agreed that eating meat is unethical. I mean, when do philosophers ever really agree on anything? :-)"

It's really awesome that you're so questioning of your choices!  1) Because you care more about yourself and your own happiness than the happiness or suffering of animals (this is what it comes down to for most people).  2) The diet is so restrictive or abnormal where you live that it has social implications such as difficultly socializing with rural or working class people and people from developing countries OR difficulty in maintaining friendships or not being judged by people at work. For example, if your job was union organizing, you may find it very important to fit in with your peers and would want to avoid having a diet associated with the wealthy.  Or if you were in the Peace Corps and wanted to fit in well with the community you're serving.  Or you're already a pretty weird person and don't want to have another reason for your friends to not invite you places.  3) You're under 18 and your family won't allow you to.  4) You have an illness that requires a diet that is not compatible.  5) Because you care more about fitness goals and believe you will be more likely to meet those goals on an omni diet.  6) You're in prison, a nursing home, or a mental institution.

It's not exactly an argument against veganism, but rather an argument that eating certain beef could be vegan."
vegan,3e2v5k,squeek502,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting paper, but it seems to miss that to many vegans, veganism is more than just reducing suffering; it's a refusal to be complicit in animal exploitation. Certainly it is a problem that lots of animals are killed by harvesting combines and whatnot, but that could at least be reduced when society starts to take animal interests more seriously. We won't ever take animal interests seriously as long as we continue to exploit them on purpose.  Also I think this point of view probably ignores all of the habitat that must be destroyed to allow room for grazing cows, especially the Amazonian rainforest.  Edit: and also raising fully grass fed cows is probably the worst form of animal agriculture when it comes to environmental destruction."
vegan,3e2v5k,andjok,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"Also, if you look at the studies that purport to show that veganism kills more animals, they all have serious flaws. Most glaringly, the main study (which uses data aggravated from three other studies) calculates animal death per acre, and fails to take into account the fact that veganism allows for fewer acres to be used. So, the animal deaths per person is much lower. Additionally, the studies tend to be very small (one was a look at an English farm and only included about two dozen mice) and often not representative (another looked at a sugar crane farm, which uses a method of slash and burn which is particularly fatal to animals in the field)."

vegan,3e2v5k,andjok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the particular numbers matter too much for the argument to merit at least some consideration.  As far as I know, it's possible to graze ruminants like cows in a responsible manner; that is, using non-irrigated rangeland with a high acre:cow ratio to avoid overgrazing. In this scenario, it seems reasonable to assume that the only avoidable death that would be caused is the cow being slaughtered for meat.  So, if that's the case, and if it's also the case that on any given acre of cropland, more than 1 animal is killed during production or harvest, then it seems reasonable to assume that raising cows for beef would cause less animal deaths than producing crops in certain situations.  I do not know how it all breaks down in reality. I just think it can't be dismissed so easily.  EDIT: Note that I have ignored the environmental impact of pastured ruminants, which is definitely something that should be factored in. It's a complicated issue to be sure."

But my point was that the people who are in a position to improve harvesting methods probably won't be able to have a serious discussion about saving those animals until our society takes animal interests more seriously, so we need to focus on stopping the purposeful slaughter of animals first."
vegan,3e2v5k,andjok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see why we couldn't do both at the same time. Obviously, stopping the billions of animals killed for food each year is the most important/effective thing, but if we also had an established, wide-spread, proven, and viable vegan agriculture alternative to point to, it'd certainly be nice.  Some vegans might assume that means organic agriculture, but organic relies heavily on factory farming for its fertilizer (manure, bone meal, blood meal, fish meal, feather meal, etc).   We can point to veganic/stock-free in theory, but, currently, we can't realistically get veganic/stock-free food unless we are growing it ourselves."

People who live in food deserts, areas in a first world country where grocery stores with fresh produce are very far away, may find it impossible or difficult to go vegan. Although meat and cheese is expensive, people who live in poverty may not have a choice but to consume animal products in certain situations. Some people might not have the luxury of time or Internet resources.   Of course someone can still go vegan in these circumstances, but what I'm trying to say is that we can't blame people for not being able to go vegan overnight when we live in such a pervasive non vegan world.

vegan,3e2v5k,YourVeganFallacyIs,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"The most interesting argument I've heard is that animals are not moral agents and so we have no obligations to them because they cannot understand any sort of obligations to us. Then when confronted with marginal cases such as children, mentally disabled/ill, etc, someone who holds this position might say that children usually grow up to be moral agents and other cases are merely deviations from a ""normal"" human and should still have the basic rights of those humans.  It's an interesting thought, but it seems absurd when you really think about why we still protect the severely mentally disabled and other fringe cases. We maintain that they deserve protection because they are the most vulnerable among humans and they are not at fault for not being able to understand the world; it's not like we only protect them because we aren't sure where they stand morally and just want to be safe. Any distinction made between a human who lacks a sense of morality and a similar nonhuman is just speciesist  Also I think that line of thinking relies on morality as part of a social contract, as it is presented as an implied understanding between humans. But I believe the social contract is a fiction and is too easy to use to justify unjust acts and institutions."

For example, people might not have an ethical problem with a lab grown burger or eating an animal that you accidentally hit and killed with your car.  This distinction might fit with the definition in the sidebar by the way. A problem with that definition is that what it asks seems nearly impossible. Insects are animals, and to be a ""true"" vegan I could no longer drive to work/travel by train because a few might hit my windscreen.

vegan,3e2mlq,flatlyaffected,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"B12 is something you'll want to hedge your bets on.  It can be life-threatening, or at least life-altering, causing symptoms like:   Over the course of two months, a 62-year-old man developed numbness and a “pins and needles” sensation in his hands, had trouble walking, experienced severe joint pain, began turning yellow, and became progressively short of breath. The cause was lack of vitamin B12 in his bloodstream, according to a case report from Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital published in The New England Journal of Medicine. It could have been worse—a severe vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to deep depression, paranoia and delusions, memory loss, incontinence, loss of taste and smell, and more, according to another article in today’s New England Journal.  A wide variety of signs and symptoms may occur including a decreased ability to think and changes in personality such as depression, irritability, and psychosis. Abnormal sensations, changes in reflexes, and poor muscle function can also occur as may inflammation of the tongue, decreased taste, low red blood cells, reduced heart function, and decreased fertility  Neurological symptoms: Sensory or motor deficiencies (absent reflexes, diminished vibration or soft touch sensation), subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, seizures,[9][10][11][12] or even symptoms of dementia [13] and or other psychiatric symptoms may be present. The presence of peripheral sensory-motor symptoms or subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord strongly suggests the presence of a B12 deficiency instead of folate deficiency. Methylmalonic acid, if not properly handled by B12, remains in the myelin sheath, causing fragility. Dementia and depression have been associated with this deficiency as well, possibly from the under-production of methionine because of the inability to convert homocysteine into this product. Methionine is a necessary cofactor in the production of several neurotransmitters.   I'd say that everyone should take B12, ideally.  Even in carnivores B12 deficiency is pretty high.  Having too much B12 is many orders of magnitude less dangerous than having too little.  Thinking you can meet the bare minimum requirement by just drinking fortified soy milk seems like a tremendous gamble with your health.  I take at least 2000 mcg Methylcobalamin B12 daily."

I used to eat a half cup of rice or quinoa with a meal, I've learned that a quarter cup is totally enough food for me. The same with measuring the oils you cook with.

vegan,3e2qz0,vololi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"White rice has a high glycemic index, meaning it is turned to sugar in the gut very quickly. This is because rice starches are shorter than the starches found in other grains and vegetables, and none of this starch is ""resistant starch"" which cannot be broken down by our guts and goes on to be processed by the gut bacteria in the large bowel.  Glycemic index is a way of measuring how a food affects blood sugar. Glucose has a GI of 100, because it's pure sugar and is absorbed very easily. Rice is 89, which is high. Compare that to other grains like pearl barely (28) or corn (60) or quinoa (53).  Eating lots of rice is like eating lots of fruit or sugary snacks. It's not bad for you in moderation, but you wouldn't want to be getting most of your calories from it. Sugars don't make you feel full in the same way as fat does (it's a physiological response) and the lack of fibre means your gut microbes can't process fibres into short chain fatty acids like propionate which also make you feel full. Not to mention that blood sugar oscillations have always thought to have a detrimental affect on appetite.   If you eat the right number of calories per day, you won't get fat. But it's easier to eat those calories and be satisfied if you choose filling, healthy foods."
vegan,3e2qz0,Puddock,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think your view of food is very Western. Most people in Asia, the most populated place on Earth, get their calories from rice. In general, their diets tend to be high carb, low fat but they are certainly not facing struggles with weight gain. Well I guess they are now since they are adopting more Western, non WFPB, and meat heavy diets (heavy in fat, cholesterol, and salt). But I think you get my point.  I totally agree with you that if you eat the right number of calories per day, you won't get fat which is why I said eat for your height+weight.  I just feel the need to state that rice isn't the ""fat"" food that the Western world makes it out to be."
vegan,3e2qz0,vololi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm doing my PhD in how carbohydrates are broken down in the gut and contribute to caloric intake. I'm from the West (UK), but you can take the rice where ever you want, it's broken down in the same manner.  The context is important, and this is what you're getting at; but I'm no expert. If you're eating rice within the context of a traditional Asian diet, it tends to be paired with a large variety of fibrous vegetables and only small quantities of meat. Remember that even if you're getting 60% of your calories from rice, 20% from pulses and 20% from vegetables... that's still a hell of a lot of vegetables. It's very healthy generally (barring the love of some cultures within Asia for salty soy sauce - I'm looking at you, Japan, with your higher than expected rate of ischemia) and it's that pairing with lots of veggies that make it work so well; because you have the stuff that's digested quickly but also the recalcitrant stuff that makes it's way to your bowel and keeps you feeling satisfied. Besides that, the rate of activity of the average person in India or China is generally better than the Western world which I'd imagine would help.  Westerners have a bunch of social context that make eating stuff harder than it needs to be. Beyond the social eating, the boredom eating and the lack of activity - we tend to pair our carbs with sauces and sides that aren't heavy enough on the veg and we end up with a meal that's all easily digested or full of meat (which comes with it's own health issues we all know very well on this sub I guess). People in the US and UK are getting roughly half the optimal fibre intake whereas places like India, China and Japan are all getting rather a lot more. On top of reducing fibre, we tend to add yet more sugar to these sauces and sides and we refine our carbohydrates rather than eating whole grains.   It's really dangerous to take a single food item outside of it's cultural context and say ""hey, you can eat this! they eat it in Asia and none of those guys are fat!"". Beyond the obvious logical flaws, we westerners really can't be trusted. A westerner is likely to over use the rice, under use the vegetables and drown everything in sweet sauces or deep fried tofu. To make it work, you really need to be eating foods that have rice, vegetables and spices, in the right proportion without any embellishments. The fact remains that rice on it's own is high calorie and made from easily digestible starches which get broken down to glucose almost immediately in the stomach; you can over-eat your rice, and it will make you fat if you do so.   I'm Scottish, and one of our traditional poor-person stables is pearled barley, which I much prefer for bulking out foods, it's as cheap as rice but it's got about twice the dietary fibre. If I do get rice, I get brown rice, which retains much more dietary fibre than white. I think the key to losing weight though, for anybody, is keeping meals very simple. Plan to eat the appropriate amounts of (whole) grains according to your calorie requirements, make sure you're getting at least the minimum required of your fats and proteins, and bulk the diet out with veggies. If you're hungry, take 100 cal out of grains and use it for 100 cal of broccoli, which is more filling.  I don't think I'm really arguing with you as such, it's just that the devil is in the details."
vegan,3e2qz0,Puddock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude, but basically your entire point is it all boils down to what we choose to eat our rice with? Doesn't this agree my initial recommendation that one should avoid processed foods or things with high fat, oil, or salt and not necessarily rice itself? I am certainly not pointing to rice as being the healthiest or most nutritious food on the planet, but it certainly is not the cause for weight gain or obesity as long as you are not eating more than the RDA of calories."
vegan,3e2qz0,vololi,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"rice is not fattening. You would have to be eating a shit ton of it to become fat off of it.   You can easily over eat rice, especially white rice, especially if you struggle with your weight because you tend to over eat anyway. There are other grains which are harder to over-eat on due to a higher fibre content and lower calorie content which may be a better option for somebody trying to lose weight. Even just switching from white (0.4g fibre/100g) to brown (1.8g fibre/100g) can make a serious difference to overall fibre intake, which can make you feel fuller. Furthermore, westerners don't tend to eat rice plain, and if you eat your rice paired with sauces high in calories then you're going to consume WAY too many calories, and if you're not good at calorie counting you might not realise this. You then went on to say:   Most people in Asia, the most populated place on Earth, get their calories from rice. In general, their diets tend to be high carb, low fat but they are certainly not facing struggles with weight gain.   Which is simply fallacious logic, just because they eat lots of rice there, doesn't mean it's not going to contribute to obesity here. In order to get the benefits from a simple rice-and-veggies HFLC diet, you need to take on more aspects of this than just the rice.  Your advice made it sound like rice was an innocuous ""free"" food which could be consumed without caution. Somebody might be tempted to take that as ""add rice to your diet"" rather than ""take away processed foods from your diet"" or ""add more veggies"", which should have been your main points.

The thing is people have given $6k for literally nothing so you could have put the prices up.

We live in a country where a large percent of the population still literally believes that a white guy with a beard in the sky created the world 5000 years ago in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary... most humans just aren't built for critical introspection and logical evaluation of facts and will resist any attempt at getting them to do that."

Maybe just a message saying something like ""Yeah, when I first learned about what happens in factory farms, I was pretty shocked!

vegan,3e1g4m,fr00tcrunch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:57:44 2015 UTC,"It's a really difficult one. I have a vegetarian friend who condemns all meat eaters but still eats eggs and dairy and buys loads of leather bags and I always want to call her up on it so much because she claims to really love animals and I'm always like how can you! The only thing that stops me is, before I turned vegan I had this stereotype in my head of judgemental militant people who only ate salad and if a vegan or vegetarian had said anything to me about my diet I would have switched off immediately and jumped on the defence. I know it's not fair but if you think saying something could genuinely change this person's behaviour then I'd say go for it but be careful how you phrase your point. If you know they won't change then maybe leave it. As frustrating as it is I think the best thing for veganism is to promote an ideal away from the stereotype, bite our tongues and pretend to be more laid back. This isn't me saying I'm laid back, it kills me not being able to say anything but if every vegan and vegetarian I'd met had been really nice I probably would have transitioned a lot sooner. To be honest most were completely lovely and didn't pass comment ever about what I ate, but it was the odd one who I felt was judging me that just completely put me off it. I know people should look above that and think about the animal and not the people who follow the lifestyle but unfortunately that's not always the case.   If they're the type of people who might be open to it and listen then by all means try and explain or link them to Earthlings haha. That seems the quickest way to change people's minds.  I hope this helps, and it's your call at the end of the day. I've just thought this kind of thing so many times myself and that's the conclusion I've drawn from it.

vegan,3e1g4m,knitknitterknit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:22:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree, this is really tricky.  I don't know what is the best way to handle these things.  On one side, when did anyone ever become vegan because their vegan friend didn't say anything/ talk about it? I feel the opposite in that I probably would have become vegan a lot sooner if someone talked some sense into me and called me out on my bullshit! It took me 29 years to go vegan after meeting many respectful vegetarians, it was always ""that works for you , this works for me and I'm not one to judge"" which in a way perhaps enforced and supported my carnism (of course I didn't think about it like that at the time)  On the other hand, I am very careful about what I say, it really is a catch 22, you can definitely do more harm than good if you're not careful. I've definitely been burned by this in the past year I've been vegan.  Vegan story time:  About six months ago I had just got off work and was packing my things and one of my vegetarian friends/coworkers was packing up next to me.  She's an ethical ovo lacto vegetarian who's been veg way longer than I have. As I was packing up I noticed her purse, which to me, really looked like it was made of fake leather. I got really excited and asked if it was a fake leather purse. I guess she thought I was trolling (definitely not, Ive gotten the, ""you know sugar isnt vegan etc..."" as I eat something with sugar, type of comment from omnis enough to know not to do that shit). Anyway, she got SUPER PISSED. Im the reason people hate vegans, I'm the reason more people don't go vegan, I'm so judgemental, I am bad for the movement, veg is a message of peace etc... to this day I still feel a bit on thin ice with her. Not to mention it was a huge blow to my vegan morale. Looking back it was a terrible time to ask, and in general a man should never comment on a woman's purse unless he has something nice to say, and unless you're sure about it not being leather you shouldn't ask. I apologized profusely, and we are friendly and on speaking terms now but because of my question I lost the only person I could confide in/vent about being a vegan. We never talk about veg*nism anymore and I'm afraid if I bring it up it will make things worse.  Moral of the story, even though I don't think people go vegan because of the ""silent vegan"", you gotta be really careful about what you say (especially to vegetarians, they can be more sensitive than omnis). Otherwise you could potentially confirm every vegan stereotype with a seemingly innocuous comment/question."

vegan,3e1g4m,CoquetteClochette,2,Tue Jul 21 10:33:21 2015 UTC,"Be gentle with her! I was a vegetarian from age 6 to 22; I'd become as set in my veggie ways as any other omnivore and I truly believed I was doing right. I only bought cage free eggs and I thought dairy cattle had a constant supply of milk. I was ignorant!   And  a vegan absolutely ripped into me when I was about 16 or 17. Told me that I wasn't helping, sneered at me, told me I was a murderer and all sorts of other really horrible things and that I wasn't welcome at the veg*n pot-luck I had intended to go to. Now, I'm not saying you're thinking of being a downright awful person to her, but that incident prevented me from giving vegans any credit or respect until I eventually learned the truth about cows and had to reassess my morality from there.  Based on my experience, treat her as if she's benignly unaware, and gently encourage her to explore the topics on her own. The veal industry is a good start. One of the arguments that struck me (after I became vegan, weirdly) was that I would buy cage free eggs for moral reasons, and yet eat eggs from unknown sources in baked goods or at restaurants without a second thought. There are definitely things you can tell her to make her think, but any negativity you fire her way might only push her away and harm your cause.  Regarding the welfarist vs. rights approach, I think a lot of vegans and vegetarians start off from a welfarist stance and actually come around to the animal rights stance after they've made the switch and had a chance to really think about it."

In the United States we also have eggs that are labeled as ""free-range"" or ""cage-free"". I personally don't believe that the chickens treated humanely in those situations though. Here is an article that discusses the differences.  http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/confinement_farm/facts/cage-free_vs_battery-cage.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/  tl;dr: So, while cage-free does not necessarily mean cruelty-free, cage-free hens generally have significantly better lives than those confined in battery cages.

Moreover, the bones of spent layers often shatter during slaughter. When this happens, bone fragments can penetrate the meat and reduce its value as a marketable product.

The federal one covers baby food, for example.   And if you came away thinking that was the ONLY regulation... then Mr. Oliver did an amazing job of completely bullshitting you into believing something that is in fact the complete opposite of reality.  There are so many regulations (USDA, FDA, the various food, agriculture, restaurant and other state-level regulatory agencies, not to mention the DEA, the BATF, as well as the Depts. of Education {federal AND state} and so on) -- that it's almost impossible to even keep track of them, much less the various ""rulings"" and somewhat ephemeral definitions/redefinitions of the so called ""standards""...  And all of that is just for food that is grown/raised & processed domestically within the US; on top of that there are all of the various trade agreements and treaties that alter how they interact with imported foods, etc.  Oliver posits the standard populist demagogue line: that it should all be ""simple and uniform"".  That certainly sounds appealing, even logical, but it's incredibly disingenuous.  Moreover, when it comes to ""food waste"" I can pretty much guarantee you that Mr. Oliver himself is no ""saint"", nor is his employer -- the amount of food that probably gets tossed from the Comedy Central ""greenroom"" on a daily basis... would probably feed a decent sized family -- and I rather doubt that Jon Oliver goes ""dumpster diving"" for his own daily meals (he's far too ""important"" for that, I mean for crying out loud, he's a ""celebrity"" and as such deserves only the best.)"
vegan,3dz6qn,sverige_svenska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:50 2015 UTC,Wow - you're a pretty bitter person. Maybe his show has taken steps to turn this around. To paraphrase someone I heard recently: What you're saying is a LIE. : \
vegan,3dz6qn,sverige_svenska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"That is correct. Manufacturers decide the sell-by/best-by/expiration date.   Manufacturers want products to be good longer because it increases profit and makes the product easier to sell. There are a couple of reasons behind this.   1) Unsold product generates zero profit. This seems pretty straightforward. Product can be unsold for a variety of reasons, theft, damage, lost, etc, but for food the biggest cause of unsold product is product that is past its expiration date. Longer shelf-life reduces that chances of a product being discarded unsold, so it's more desirable for whoever has to sell the product. Okay, so why do manufacturers care? They aren't selling the product to consumers right?  2) Manufacturers are often retailers. An oddity of the food industry is that companies pay for stores to have their products. For there to be Fritos in Wal-Mart, Frito-Lay has to buy/rent shelf-space for their product. They then claim a percentage of the sale-price. Essentially, they are selling on commission. Product didn't sell, Frito-Lay is the one who has to soak up the loss. But what about when manufacturers aren't retailers?  3) Retailers don't buy products with short shelf-life. Alright, let's say we're not dealing with a corporate giant like Wal-Mart that can demand companies sell on commission. Frito-Lay is selling Fritos to a wholesaler that supplies independent gas stations. Frito-Lay gets their money once the deal is made, why do they care if it's thrown away or not? Because the retailer stills has to deal with reason #1. Unsold product generates no profit. If you know of two similar products, one with longer shelf-life and one with shorter, you will buy the one that lasts longer for your store as it maximizes the chances you will recoup your investment. Shorter shelf-life means having a harder time convincing other businesses to buy your product. It makes the investment riskier.   Going along with this, businesses will often outsource creation of new products to specialist companies/labs. When doing so, a minimum shelf-life is a standard requirement for the reasons above. If your product doesn't meet their requirements, they won't accept it. The result of this, and the influence of marketing and admins who are clueless as to how reality works, is I've dealt with companies who have demanded organic, preservative free potato salad with a six-week shelf-life. I'm sorry, but you fail at science.   4) Consumers don't like short-shelf life. Whether it's because they think the product is fresher, 'Oh, the expiration date is two-weeks further away than the one right next to it. It must be fresher!' or because they don't want food to go bad. 'This milk expires Friday and I'm not sure I'll use it up in time, better go with one that's good until next Thursday.' Consumers preferentially buy products with longer expiration dates.   So, whether it's manufacturers, retailers, or consumers, nobody wants a short-shelf life.   I hope that helps."

As an environmentalist, I think it's wonderful! It's a great way to show people that it's OK to cut down and that you've recognised that people eat an excess of meat and it's damaging the planet. By cutting down, you probably help more than by cutting out, because you set a good example for others that's not seen as extreme and more people are likely to join you. It's better to have 3 half-vegans than 1 full vegan when you take a purely utilitarian stance, especially with regards to the environment.  Animal welfare tends to be pushed aside when people want cheaper meats in silly quantities. By cutting down you can afford to be more choosy when you do eat meat, and avoid factory farmed products or eggs from battery hens. This sends a message to the producers - better welfare!   But you're on r/vegan; and we generally believe that animals are sentient beings with thoughts, feelings and rights. So you're really just committing a lesser evil than you were before, and we can't really get behind you (even though we can all acknowledge it as not as bad as before).

vegan,3e028a,pollypauline,8,Mon Jul 20 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"$200-$250 a month for two people.   I shop at regular grocery stores (Food Lion and Aldi) for the most part. I have two stores nearby that have 30% off produce and 20% off your purchase some days, so I go there for produce and to browse the clearance sections for fancy things.  I get maybe one specialty item a week that I want to try. I'm pretty strict with my spending though, so I don't usually go beyond the occasional pint of ice cream or bag of Daiya for pizza."
vegan,3e028a,bootswiththefurrr,5,Mon Jul 20 22:47:05 2015 UTC,$200-$250 a month for two people.   How do you feed yourself on $25 a week?  Could you post a photo of a receipt or give us a break down? I mean a small box of blueberries is like upwards 6 dollars where I live.
vegan,3e028a,Tissueboxhead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:08 2015 UTC,"It's more like $50-$70 a week (50 x 4 = 200 :)).  I always shop with a list and a meal plan and I stick to it. I've slowly built up my pantry with dry goods and spices this way. I pretty much only buy produce weekly and I try to base my meals mostly on what I already have. I know snacks (especially healthy ones like fruit and nuts) add up quickly but I'm not much of a snacker so I tend not to buy them. There are definitely weeks that I spend more on groceries but $250 a month is the upper range, I'd estimate.   Oh and leftovers for lunch (especially good over a bed of mixed greens if you ate all of last night's veggies).  To clarify, $250 a month is just for my food and what I cook for dinner. My boyfriend is in charge of his own (not vegan) breakfasts and lunches."

vegan,3e028a,ansile,8,Mon Jul 20 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"I spend probably about $30-50 (mostly for myself but my boyfriend and I split stuff sometimes) a week depending on if I am buying any specialty vegan stuff or going to the bulk store. I eat mostly veggies, fruits, and legumes probably. I shop at Lowe's Foods primarily because I can just walk there and Earth Fare when I want specialty stuff. My typical grocery list looks something like: Bunch of bananas. Carton of blueberries. 4 oranges. 1 large tomato like a hot house. Carton of grape tomatoes. Block of extra firm tofu. Package of tempeh. Carton of sliced baby bella mushrooms. 1 green pepper. 1 yellow and red onion. Romaine lettuce. Bag of baby spinach. Some sort of buns or loaf of bread. Some sort of pasta. Pasta sauce. Couple of cans of beans. Tortillas. Some sort of meat substitute like Boca crumbles or smart dogs. Bag of brussel sprouts. 2 baking potatoes. Clif bars"
vegan,3e028a,anachronic,5,Mon Jul 20 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"I actually put together a spreadsheet in 2014 because I was curious and I averaged about $250 a month for one person... but that also includes stuff like toothpaste and floss and cleaning stuff, since I lumped all supermarket expenses into one category... so, in reality, it was probably closer to $200 just for food.  I go to gourmet places like Whole Foods maybe twice a year... I do 99% of my shopping at local normal supermarkets like Stop&Shop and A&P.  I eat really well and buy faux meats and daiya and chocolate and good coffee... so I'm hardly living on ramen here.  Frozen produce, beans, rice, and grains are all really cheap... as are many fruits, and veggies.  Tofu is the same price (per ounce) as chicken, and Daiya is pretty competitive with actual cheese.  It's not like animal products are all that cheap these days... for example - look at the price of eggs, which is going up fast  I just cooked up some protein-packed, vitamin-packed lunch for the next 3 days for maybe $12-15, max.  I made a bunch of brown rice & lentils in the rice cooker as the base... then, to put over it, I stir-fried an onion, a big sweet potato, a bunch of broccoli, and a can of chick peas with some stir-fry sauce and garlic to season it.  It keeps wonderfully in the fridge and I just microwave it at work.   You can't even get a decent lunch at McDonalds for 3 days for $12.    Veganism is really not expensive if you don't want it to be."
vegan,3e028a,benyqpid,4,Tue Jul 21 01:33:37 2015 UTC,"I save so much more money since I've been vegan, and that's with adding another person to my shopping budget!  I usually do one ""stocking up"" trip a month for dried foods, sauces, cans of coconut milk, nuts, and whatever else I need restocked in my pantry.   And then once a week I go to a farm market and spend about $30 on produce. Then I get a head of lettuce for free every week from someone I work with (she has a very eager garden this summer!).  So for 2 people we typically stay around $300! If you include eating out, which we do maybe once a week then that's another $150 or so (and my SO buys lunch for work that I don't include in the budget but it wouldn't be much more). When I was on my own as a pregan, I think I spent $4-500 a month plus eating out or whatever.  Holy grail products: Nutritional yeast flakes, miso, tahini, soy sauce/tamari, hummus, flax seeds, coconut milk, avocado, bananas, quinoa, lentils, beans, tofu, and lately I've been all about some good, nutty bread (hummus/avocado toast is like my #1 lazy person food.)   Make your own seitan! Don't waste money buying at the store. It's super cheap to make it yourself and it's fun to experiment and feel like a magician. Also dried beans! Sooooo much cheaper than canned. I throw them in a slow cooker in the morning and they're done for me by lunch time, ready for salads or anything else! Don't spend money on the vegan cheeses (except for the fancy cultured nut cheeses once in a while!). You can make cheese sauces out of things like nuts, potatoes, rice, and nutritional yeast and so many more things! Just google ""vegan cheese recipes"" and there's a bunch out there!"
vegan,3e028a,benyqpid,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:27 2015 UTC,Thanks so much :)! I'll have to write all that down do you save a lot of money by shopping at farmer markets?
vegan,3e028a,Hippidippivegan,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"Well they're not exactly farmer's markets, but yes I think it's MUCH cheaper this way. I go to a permanent produce market that sources from local farms. They also have imported foods for things that aren't grown here. I try to buy things that are in season when possible and that cuts down the cost a lot too (and the quality is much better!). The bonus is that I'm not paying for the name brand and I find that my fresh produce keeps slightly longer since I have a better idea of how long it's been sitting on the shelf before I buy it.   I think it also helps that I'm definitely leaning more towards whole foods/plant-based since going vegan but as a pregan I was buying more processed foods which tend to be pricier.   Oh and as far as junk food goes, I like coconut bliss chocolate hazelnut fudge ice cream, dark chocolate bars, sweet chili dorritos, and snap pea crisps. I usually (try to) snack on healthier things like baby carrots and hummus or fruit."
vegan,3e028a,MasterofmyDomain30,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:39 2015 UTC,I spend about $50 a week. I recommend a farmer's market in your area if you have one! Lots of delicious and fresh fruits/veggies/bread and it's nice to support it if you can :)
vegan,3e028a,stephtveg,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"I spend about $70 a week and don't really watch my cash flow when grocery shopping. I could cut it down to $50 if I made some changes, and that's living in a city where everything is more expensive.   Budget shopping?  Bulk lentils/rice/quinoa. Whatever veggies are on sale.  tofu/beans."
vegan,3e028a,Alexhite,3,Tue Jul 21 00:47:39 2015 UTC,"I spend about 100-140 monthly. I've started to buy groceries mostly every 2 weeks and I spend about $50-60 on a stock-up trip (where I buy plenty of dry/frozen/canned stuff) and things like potatoes/onions/fresh veggies on a whenever needed basis. Not sure about what I spent pre-vegan as I live at home and I ate mostly what my parents bought. Then I went vegetarian and picked out a few things for them to buy like microwavable bags of rice & veggies and fish. Shortly after I went vegan I started buying my own groceries.  I used to eat a lot of packaged and processed food and spent $50-70+ weekly. Just recently-ish I've switched to a diet more heavy in rice/legumes/potatoes and have been making more food from scratch to save money.   So high-cost and specialty vegan products have been pretty much cut out of my diet. Holy grail though is the food should taste good brand kimchi chips--sooooo good. Or vegan ice cream of any kind, some may say it's not quite like ""real"" ice cream but I love it the same :P Don't love how much it costs or how time consuming making your own ice cream is lol and my go-to snacks are hummus with fresh veggies. Or, it's super good if you take hummus and mix it with salsa then eat it with tortilla chips and some guac. I'm so horrible because when I do this is just ends up being my meal haha  I'd say for buying groceries, it's a lot of case-by-case situations. You ought to check around at all the places near you for best prices. What I did was go into a store to buy a weeks worth of groceries, keep my receipt and write down any price of interest, then the next week I would go into a different store in my town and compare prices there. Do this with as many places as you want (or can) until you find the place(s) that's best for what you need weekly. Fortunately where I live there's a woodman's and it's better than every store around that I've been to. It's does the job and it stocks some super cheap + decent stuff. I hear aldi is great for this but I've never had much luck at aldi's.  Good luck(:"
vegan,3e028a,veganbum,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"Usually I spend about 25 to 30 dollars a week on food. Weekly items 6-8 bunches of bananas ~ $5 1lb. Medjool Dates - $6 6 apples ~ $3 fruit on sale ~ $5 Spinach and or broccoli ~ $5 1lb. Lentils - $2 Whole Wheat spahghetti - $1 Organic Sauce (tastes so much better) - $2 Almond coconut milk- $2 And then I buy things that last me for weeks or months like hummus, nooch, wraps, flour, flax.  Also keep in mind I often share my fruit so It could probably be a few dollars less. edit: I also buy dulse for $8 once every two months, and I may start buying eden soy milk since I am worried about my iodine intake.

vegan,3e028a,maroger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:48 2015 UTC,"I spend anywhere from $30-50 on groceries a week for just myself, depending on how much processed food I buy. I have a weakness for Gardein's fish filets, what can I say.  Otherwise, my staples are pretty basic: Rice, sometimes pasta, eggplant, onions/peppers, bread, hummus, avocados, bananas, cheap and/or frozen fruit, tofu, mushrooms, oats, cashew milk, and veggies for stirfry. Occasionally I'll buy a bag of nuts from Trader Joe's, and some Daiya or Chao cheese maybe twice a month. I try not to get lettuce often because I'll devour it all at once with Goddess dressing.  I remember spending $120+ every two weeks when I was a vegetarian. Before that, I wasn't paying for my own groceries. I like to shop at the nearby non-chain market that gets a decent amount of its produce locally.  My favorite vegan products are Bean & Rice Chips, and Daiya's cheesecake (because holy junk do I love cheesecake). Most of the processed stuff is totally unnecessary and overpriced, but definitely delicious. Vegan boxed mac & cheese is overhyped. It's interesting to try, but trust me when I say that far better mac can be made at home.  I eat a lot of grains and veggies."
vegan,3e028a,bruinsfab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:42:46 2015 UTC,"The way I've always looked at it, is that eating vegan saves me so much money in health-related expenses- including my mental health- that it's an investment. But after going through phases of spending extra money on processed vegan food- and trying endless recipes with more than 10 ingredients- I've found that my most enjoyable meals are always the simplest. A watermelon/in-season fruit salad or oatmeal for breakfast, avocado/tomato sandwiches for lunch, large in-season salads for dinner. Dried beans, homemade seitan, brown rice, nutritional yeast, sea salt, EVOO, bananas- and in-season produce- are my staples."

If it's repackaged, ask to contact the manufacturer and ask for the rice to be left out, if possible. Or to offer a version without rice.  Understand that this may result in a rising price though, so if your entire reason for buying it is because it's the most reasonably priced, that may end up changing.

vegan,3e04ux,gravyjackson,4,Tue Jul 21 11:11:19 2015 UTC,"I just made an awesome mushroom burger, here's what I did:   Throw 5 portobellos in the oven and lightly roast until juicy Pour the mushroom juices, one of the portobellos, half a can of black beans plus a splash of the aquafaba, a couple spoonfuls of vegan worchestershire and braggs aminos, and one squirt of liquid smoke, into a good blender and blend until as combined as possible In a large bowl, pour the other half of the black beans, and mash slightly. Add a handful of sun-dried tomatoes and some of the oil Dice the remaining mushrooms and add them to the bowl. Add 1/3 cup almond and/or cashew meal, 2 tbsp flax meal, 1-2 tbsp steak seasoning, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder,1 tbsp nutritional yeast, handful of broccoli florets  Add enough vital wheat gluten to form a dough (or rice, oat, or chickpea flour if GF)  Knead the dough to combine all the ingredients  Form patties and toss on a greased baking sheet. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for around 30 minutes.  Take out of the oven. The burgers should be cooked but still a little soft. Fry in olive oil or throw on the barbecue, and serve with caramelized onions."

Your coworkers sounds more like they're doing keto.  Paleo and keto do overlap in some ways (there are certain foods you can eat on both).  Paleo provides guidelines about what to eat and says nothing about limiting carbohydrates/fat/fiber/calories, but many paleo bloggers  encourage you to eat a ""big ass salad"".

Also, since you appear to be doing this for health reasons, someone is going to recommend you go to /r/PlantBasedDiet but this sub is, imo, much more useful. So feel free to stay and be encouraged to 'keep vegan' for many reasons like animal rights and the environmental benefits! :)  I know when I made the switch (not from paleo, but regular omni), I was super gassy and hungry all the time. You were probably eating a lot of fat on paleo so replace that with nuts and avocados! Eat more food and give yourself time to adjust! If your GI tract is not feeling well then I think eating some probiotic foods like vegan yogurt or fermented foods like kimchi or sauerkraut should help."

Sounds like she might be someone who would do well with having one meal-prep day a week and not have to worry about cooking on the other days. How often do you get together with her? Maybe you could do this together? If you make cooking fun, she'll probably be willing to do it more often! Just restrain yourself and try not to do too many of the steps. I remember having to teach my older sister how to cook pasta and it took everything in my power not to take over and show her THIS IS HOW YOU DRAIN PASTA PROPERLY. Patience will take you far.  Also if she's big on eating out, then start with veganizing that. You can show her quick, fast places to get vegan food. Chipotle is a good one. Where in the world are you? In BC we have a place called The Chopped Leaf and they're super fast and easily veganizable. Heck even taking her to Taco Bell to show that no matter how desperate you are for food, there's a vegan option out there. Amy's also has a lot of frozen vegan food that, while a bit pricey, is also very fast and easy to do. I always have at least one of those cheeseless pizzas in my freezer, just in case!  Make her an easy recipe book or tell her to come here for help. I think we have a ""cheap and easy recipes"" thread just about every other day.  Lastly, if she doesn't maintain veganism, don't take that as your failure and don't look down on her for it. She's clearly open to trying it so just keep on doing what you're doing and forgive her for slip-ups and stay positive. A ""good job for being vegan today"" text can go a long way when someone is clearly struggling with it.

vegan,3duziv,syringaferonia,9,Mon Jul 20 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"Pro pro tip: keeping avocados in the fridge causes chill damage, including vascular browning (brown streaks in the flesh). Don't put avocados in the fridge except as a last resort, and not for more than a day.  If you're ultimately planning to use your avocados in a smoothie or guacamole, you can freeze them when they reach peak ripeness. It does change the texture a bit, but it prevents them from oxidizing (which is what causes the browning). Peel them and cut them into small pieces your blender can handle, or purée first with a little lime juice.  Edit: as the parent comment says, the fridge is fine if the avocado is completely done ripening. Green avocados should stay on the counter (or in a paper bag if you want to accelerate ripening)."
vegan,3duziv,foxedendpapers,4,Mon Jul 20 04:40:19 2015 UTC,Vascular browning sounds like a super serious condition. I hope I never hear that I have this from a doctor.
vegan,3duziv,rubix_redux,2,Mon Jul 20 12:34:05 2015 UTC,I used to have about a 1/2 hit rate of good avocados when I kept them out. It increased to more like 4/5 now that I just throw them immediately in the fridge. I think if your avocado hasn't been bruised at all it might work to keep it on the counter. But the fridge also stops the bruise from wrecking the whole fruit.
vegan,3duziv,itgotyouthisfar,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:35 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. It makes sense that refrigeration world keep a bruise from spreading as quickly. Best-case scenario seems to be just not buying bruised avocados :)  How soon you'll see chill damage depends on how the avocados were stored during shipment and in the store prior to stocking, and for how long, so maybe that's a factor for you.   Out of curiosity, do you know what temperature your refrigerator is at where you keep the avocados?"
vegan,3duziv,foxedendpapers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:19:29 2015 UTC,I don't know for sure. Where they usually live is the coldest part of the fridge (occasionally they do get partially frozen). I also like more mushy avocado as long as it tastes right so I probably don't notice the chill damage as much as other people might.
vegan,3duziv,itgotyouthisfar,6,Mon Jul 20 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"I learned a bit of a routine that works well for me. Whenever I buy avocados, they are not ripe enough to eat yet. They are like rocks. So I buy a few and put them in the fridge. A week later, on my next grocery trip, I buy a few more new ones. By this time, the ones from last week are perfect. Sometimes I can start eating them sooner. Really, it's just a matter of buying new rocks every week to keep a ripening buffer."

I tend to relate the treatment of the corpses of animals to the treatment of the corpses of humans, though, for example roadkill isn't even looked twice at, but if a human body were dead on the side of the road, it would obviously be a crisis. So, for me, I'd try to defy that societal convention and ask myself whether I'd feel comfortable collecting and displaying bits of human bodies, and if my answer was no, I'd probably apply the same one to this. That's just my personal philosophy, though - I really don't think what you're suggesting is non-vegan or cruel in a general sense. I don't know that I necessarily think what you're proposing is wrong, but I think what I've said adds a bit to the dialogue that probably isn't normally thought of.

In nature, the old and sick are the ones that are killed, but with humans we kill the big ones, the one's with nice antlers. Or, we set out traps that kill anything that walks by.   Basically, TLDR, hunting is bad on multiple levels. If you really want to help a population stay in it's correct numbers, you should spay/neuter. That's rarely needed, however, as nature is able to balance it's self without human interference. Hunting is a big business, and makes a looot of money. That's the only reason it's legal or even around at all!   It turns out wolves in heavily hunted areas had higher levels of a stress hormone and higher reproductive hormones. So, they were stressed out and mating more frequently. “By killing off a higher number of the animals are we actually going to stimulate higher reproductive efforts that are actually going to be counterproductive,"" Smits asked. http://nwpr.org/post/heavily-hunted-wolves-stressed-out-and-mating-more-frequently  Hunting does remove some animals from the population, but it does not keep deer populations at a continually reduced level.

vegan,3dy8s0,idontknowanymooooore,5,Mon Jul 20 15:10:32 2015 UTC,"The answer to this really depends on the dose. If it is a low dose, you may be better off taking 1-2 a day (if it is close to 100% of RDA).  /u/Alexhite and /u/WV6I both do pretty much what I do, and what seems to be in line with clinical recommendations. Generally, as the dose increases then the frequency can decrease. 1000-2000mcg seems to be most commonly taken about twice a week. 2500mcg+ is commonly taken once a week. I have a previous history of B12 deficiency as an omnivore so I often take higher doses. I personally don't think it is necessary to take higher/more frequent than the guideline above, but I prefer to do 2-3 times a week.   For reference, the CDC recommends oral 1000mcg daily for those with clinical deficiency, and 500-1000mcg daily for those with subclinical deficiency. Source: http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/b12/patients.html   If you aren't deficient, then something like this table: http://www.veganhealth.org/b12/rec I have seen before, but at the moment I can't seem to find a government sort of citation for recommended supplement dosing for maintenance.

If that is the case with OP's supplement, it is totally fine one pill per day instead of two or three. There are negative consequences to over supplementing most vitamins and minerals. The primary concern with B12 is acne. While your body can only utilize so much B12, the higher levels will still travel your blood stream and feed the bacteria which cause breakouts.    http://time.com/3941332/vitamin-b12-acne/  [edited to add the link]"
vegan,3dy8s0,satosaison,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:11 2015 UTC,"So if you get an acne outbreak, just lower the total intake to a point where you don't get it any more? I mean, concerning how grave the consequences of deficiencies are, I'd much rather scale back on supplementation intake rather than risk irreversible nerve damage. Same with vitamins and minerals, get regular blood work done by a doctor."
vegan,3dy8s0,PyotrPan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"...huh? All I said was that you don't need more than your daily recommended intake of B12, and here you are going full-on freak out over irreversible nerve damage. I've been vegan for 10 years and don't take a B12 supplement, but that wasn't my advice. I just said it was probably cool to take 1 pill per day instead of 2. Chill bro."

vegan,3dy8s0,DustbinK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:44 2015 UTC,Not advising to skip out on B12 supplementing but it's surprising how many foods have added B12. Not even 'veggie' foods like soy milk but also your cereals etc.  Supplementing to the normal RDA and no more seems more than enough. I'm using a daily vegan multivitamin for this.

Breakfast is either Oatmeal or Oat Cereal   Oatmeal: 0.5cup rolled oats, 0.5 pouch instant flavored oatmeal, 1tbsp flax meal, 1 whole banana, 1 cup hemp/soy milk. ~435kcals. Oat Cereal: 0.75 cup rolled oats, 0.25 cup granola, 2 chopped brazil nuts, 1 whole banana, 1 cup hemp/soy milk. Maybe some cinnamon. ~575kcals.   Brunch is usually my snack between breakfast and lunch. 0.25 cup trail mix (all nuts, dried fruit), 2 brazil nuts (if not in breakfast), 1 apple, 2 oreos. ~360-420 depending on brazil nuts.  Lunch. Hummus or meatless chicken.   Hummus Sandwich 0.5 cup chickpeas, 1.5tbsp tahini, 0.25 whole avocado, 2 slices bread, romaine lettuce and tomatoes, a little vegenaise on the lettuce side. I make a 4 serving batch of hummus (1 can chickpeas, 0.33 cup tahini) and so a fourth of that with everything else is ~500 kcals.  ""Chicken"" Sandwiches: I eat these about twice a week. 2 strips Simple Truth meatless crispy chicken pieces, 0.25 avocado, vegenaise, 2 slices of bread, lettuce or spinach, tomato. ~500kcals.   Dinner.   Rice & Beans: Some variation of 0.33 cup brown rice, 1 cup canned beans. Cilantro, onion, garlic, tomato sauce, or veggie broth. A cup of spinach, broccoli, carrots, whatever I have and whatever I can fit in. ~440kcals. (I make this in bulk, and then freeze each meal wrapped in freezer paper so that I have quick dinners when I get home late). Pasta Soup: This is a lazy meal. I just boil some noodles and throw them in to canned soup. 1 cup dry noodles, a serving of soup... ~500kcals for my choices. Alternatively, I also do quinoa in tomato soup, with some white beans or whatever it needs to get to ~500kcals.    Additionally, I tend to eat a potato everyday. Sometimes I cut them up and bake 3 at a time in the oven, and then take a third of that with me to lunch, or I will eat it in the evening before or after dinner. I also like to make curry, but I am still figuring that one out and it isn't a big part of my meal rotations. I try to eat close to 2000 calories a day. I've found success by just making sure I reach close to 500 calories for every meal, and keeping my snack pack filled. There's a small gap and so I try to eat 100-200 calories of veggies to fill that gap. I find it pretty easy to plan a ~500 cal meal, then scale it up 4-6 times and make bulk, then freeze. I can generally prepare everything on a Sunday afternoon (with focus and commitment) so that I don't have to cook much throughout the week...

I can eat the same meal 4-5 times (on different days) before I really need something else. This helps in my planning.  Breakfast is almost always an Amy's vegan breakfast burrito + Mateo's salsa + OJ. I almost never vary from this; only when my wife makes waffles. But she's usually up a lot later than I am on weekends so waffles are usually lunch. :)  Lunch varies but is consistent for a week. Usually I'll cook something for weekday lunches on Sunday afternoons and eat the same thing all week. It could be pasta, pasta salad, soup, sandwiches (tomato + cucumber or chickpea salad usually), whatever. The trick is that I prepare it in one big whack on Sunday and eat it all week.  Dinner sometimes goes along the same lines as lunch - I'll often cook up something fairly big on Sunday and eat leftovers at least through Wednesday.  Aside from those meals, I always have some staples on-hand, in the freezer:   A variety of Gardein products. Currently my favorite is the turkey cutlets. The fishless filets are always good, as are the chicken sliders. Frozen, microwave steamable bags of mixed veggies, big enough for 2. Frozen, microwave steamable bags of quinoa & rice mixture, either from Costco or Kroger's organic brand, also big enough for 2.   (Those last 2 combine with salad dressing to make a good, quick meal.)   Homemade Sietan loaves. These freeze pretty well and I usually keep one in the refrigerator. I'll use this for anything from throwing chunks into the aforementioned veggies-quinoa-rice to a quick stir-fry to making sliders out of them."

I know some people see as extreme his advocacy for abolition instead of ""welfarism"", but leave it to a law professor to craft sound logical arguments. This would be the opposite tactic of making people watch Earthlings."
vegan,3dxlxn,KlugerHans,4,Mon Jul 20 13:28:27 2015 UTC,ok. 1 hour 58 minutes left. what next?
vegan,3dxlxn,__PRIME,8,Mon Jul 20 13:41:11 2015 UTC,"Watch the Vegucated documentary. The 6 people who're featured going vegan for 6 weeks offer a good spread of characters who someone could relate to. Their lifestyle, their beliefs or their health problems. The documentary is set out in an easily digestible format especially for an interested omni.  There's only a 10-15 minute section where the participants are shown footage of cruelty. This section is also handled well for an omni watching. They're watching other people, some whom they may relate to at this point, watch the footage too. You, your friend  and these six people are all experiencing the footage together. This has more effect and I've found is received as less threatening than 1hr 30mins of Earthlings would be. When I watched Earthlings as a vegan for the first time it solidified my belief. Set in stone that I could never live with myself supporting what I had seen done to the animals. For an Omni though? That kind of 'deep end' viewing is just scary and incredibly uncomfortable, at that point they won't feel it's a chance to look into education on Veganism but rather like they're being put under the spotlight ""Look what you support. Look what YOU'RE doing. LOOK."" The end result of this is outright refusal to watch any more usually, achieving the opposite of what you want when trying to show someone some info on a vegan lifestyle. Save that for later I say.   At the end of the documentary there is a number of results from tests done before the six weeks were started and they all get given their results. Again this could hit home with people (I personally have piqued interest in some family members as the potential benefits surrounding blood pressure, cholesterol etc have had them wondering).  I suppose to summarize, on a two hour time limit some sort of documentary then a bit of discussion would seem best to me. As I've said, with that documentary being catered to the person you're discussing it with, health benefits and that side of the lifestyle are better to gain traction than the cruelty footage at that point.   If you wanted some ideas there's a list here  To add to that list: Peacable Kingdom, Earthlings, The Cove, Speciesism: The Movie, Live and Let Live.  I'd obviously advise that you look into any one you haven't seen yet to check it's content with your Omni viewer in mind. Some are quite brutal like Earthlings and The Cove but some barely reference Veganism and just focus on pure quality of Health like Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead.  I guess as a final note I'd just say well done for looking to introduce someone to the idea of a Vegan lifestyle. It's incredibly rewarding to even help someone develop an interest in it and incredibly admirable for you to be seeking to do so.   Final FINAL addition: YouTube for all things cooking. It's incredible, The Vegan Zombie is a top one for me. Showing amazing cooking, often comfort foods, that an Omni probably fears they will be without.   Have fun!"

vegan,3dxssx,IceRollMenu2,6,Mon Jul 20 12:38:49 2015 UTC,It could just be that you're eating more fruits and vegetables and therefore are having a healthier diet than you previously had.
vegan,3dxssx,newlyvegan,5,Mon Jul 20 13:05:13 2015 UTC,More micronutrients = faster hair and nail growth  Vegan = often has more micronutrients than standard omni diet
vegan,3dxssx,misskinky,3,Mon Jul 20 14:24:27 2015 UTC,"I think it might also be because it's summer. Hair loves humid weather and is more fragile during the cold months. You could just be retaining more hair as opposed to it growing faster.   It could also have a lot to do with you having cut your hair. People say ""your hair will grow back twice as fast after you cut it"" for a reason. It's not because the hair is faster that it happens. You probably cut off some unhealthy hair that would normally have shed ( making your hair to appear to have grown less). The longer your hair is, the older the hair at the ends is. As your ends get longer they are at a higher risk of breaking off/shedding/ ending their life cycle. With your hair being recently cut, you have a lot of new healthy hair on your head that is less likely to break off.    With all that in mind you are probably just retaining more length and taking more of a notice to it because you cut it recently."
vegan,3dxssx,yanibani,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"Unless you were regularly measuring your hair growth before, I'd chalk it up to the short haircut unless you were losing length due to hair breakage on the ends. When I got a pixie cut, growth was a lot more noticeable when every 2-3 weeks I was debating whether I needed a trim."
vegan,3dxssx,bewareofduck,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:24 2015 UTC,If your diet was bad before it could just be your heart Sy having much more access to nutrients.

The cheeze packet isn't powder; it's a cheese sauce. It's perfectly gooey and delicious. The noodles are gluten-free, but really good. It doesn't taste like Daiya cheddar shreds, but I don't think many people would figure out that this is vegan if you didn't tell them.   The Upton's Bar-B-Que Jackfruit, however.... Seriously disappointing. I've made my own BBQ jackfruit, and it was really good. This stuff was poorly seeded, so it had lots of hard chunks in it, ruining the texture. It seemed under-cooked, or under-brined, or something.... It is supposed to be ready to serve (it's shelf-stable), so it wasn't that I didn't cook it long enough. The package suggests pan frying for a few minutes, which I did. But it was still a tangy and tasted more like fruit than a meat substitute. That would have been okay, but the BBQ sauce was spicy yet sweet, so it was more sweet and sour than BBQ 'carnitas.' My omni boyfriend liked it more than I did, strangely enough."

The sour cream and onion chips however.....  I've made this one, and it was really good. You could bake the mac and cheeze without the crust and it would be fine: http://veganyackattack.com/2013/09/30/mozzarella-mac-deep-dish-pizza/  And I've added cheddar shreds to this one successfully as well (this is my go-to, easy to modify cheeze sauce): http://www.theppk.com/2013/09/blt-mac-cheeze/"

Don't look at photos of people and say I want abs like that. Everyone's abs and specifically their abdominal walls are very different. Depending on genetics, different muscle imbalances, how you train your abs, and also how much you have used your abs your whole life, your abs will look very different. Not everyone can get a defined six pack. Look an Olympia Arnold he had a 4 pack and his lower abs never developed. Some people get deep V cuts others don't. Just get lean and see your abs and train em. That's how they will look and learn to love them!"

vegan,3dwvps,StreetsofGalway,11,Mon Jul 20 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"The issue is that people don't often understand the bigger picture. For example, most people are completely unaware that there are approximately 20,000 species of bees in the world, and that Apis mellifera (the common honey bee) is but a single species and  is an introduced species to most parts of the world, is very genetically homogenous (meaning the genetic strains used are few and very similar) and often out competes and does damage to or destroys native bee populations.   Here in Australia, honey bees compete not only with our native (stingless) bees, but also with other wildlife for living spots such as fallen logs, holes in trees etc.   I could practically write a novel on why the simplistic 'buy more honey to save the bees!' chant is misguided at best, damaging to the bees, us and the environment at worst. This would include the complete overlooking of the neonicotinamide problem (a class of agricultural chemicals with strong links to CCD - colony collapse disorder, the main problem facing bees, and not just the honey bee), the fact that some native bees are actually better pollinators than Apis, and the fact that many bee colonies are not primarily used for honey production and rather are shipped around the country side to be placed next to crops when they need fertilising. There are other complicating issues as well, but if people are genuinely interested in assisting the bees (and not just jumping at the misguided excuse to continue eating honey) then they would do things such as cultivate native social bee hives, plant lots of local flowers, create bees houses (mainly for solitary bees), and campaign for the abolition of neonicotinamides and other chemicals linked to bee population collapse.   Obligatory apologies for misspelling and formatting issues due to being on mobile travelling home from work."

The 'buy more honey' theory is based on the assumption that market forces can somehow fix this problem, when in fact they play a big part in the collapse. There is strong, peer reviewed evidence that neonicotinamides are complicit in the bee demise, but they are currently a very important agricultural chemical in many countries and there is strong economic push back from manufacturers against any kind of regulation that would assist in getting bee populations back to healthy numbers. They would lose money if they had to find alternatives.   So... even on the demand side, market forces are already strong, honey is a huge seller, bees are known to be important in many economically significant food growing cycles. EVEN WITH such strong market forces behind the importance of the bee, their populations are STILL collapsing. How does buying more jars of honey help?"

First of all, he treats his bees better than he treats me sometimes so if the issue is just mistreatment, most small time bee keepers I've encountered through him all care greatly about the health of the bees. Likewise, he spends a lot of time moving hives for people who call him complaining of infestations. These people would otherwise burn these hives or otherwise exterminate the bees. He moves the hives to his little bee keeper property or sometimes even just a different place on the property they came from. So, he is saving bees. He doesnt hire out the bees for farmers but it is a thing that goes on.  All this to say, yes he collects honey and sells it.  But I see no issue with it since he treats the bees like queens (pun intended) and saves lots of them. And that if omnivores are going to buy honey to support bee colonies, they should go find a local bee keeper and see their process first hand to make sure they are supporting the ones who aren't burning down hives for the winter and plucking wings."

vegan,3dwvps,Versepelles,6,Mon Jul 20 05:44:45 2015 UTC,"The term ""animal"" is very poorly defined. For example, aquatic sponges are technically in the kingdom animalia, but lack nervous systems. Do they require the same treatment and consideration as a bull? I would answer no, the require much less consideration because they are much less complex. We can roughly measure complexity based on neurological evolution, and thus figure out how much consideration each species deserves. Sponges deserve less than insects which deserve less than fish which deserve less than pigs which deserve less than humans.  Equating all ""animals"" is scientifically naive and realistically impractical, even though we would love to protect all life equally."

If you look back to the previous comment,   they do not have high sentience, so they do not warrant high consideration   it is clear that I wish to make a judgement based on an individual capacity of sentience. Here, sponges clearly have little sentience, therefore they merit little respect. The argument delineates a continuum of sentience and thus a continuum of respect. Perhaps a better example would be a simple organism with a simple neurological system.  Ctenophores do not have a brain. Let us repeat the thought experiment from the sponges- should a ctenophore be treated with the same respect as a bull? No, because they cannot internalize pain in the same way.  In the same way, ctenophores require less consideration than scorpions, which require less than dolphins. While this turns out to be specist in practice, the logic is based on neurological capacity, not on the criteria of taxology."

vegan,3dwvps,WritePublishDie,4,Mon Jul 20 07:37:33 2015 UTC,"No, I read it. I was responding specifically to the sponge issue.  There may be some merit to what Versepelles says though. We cannot in a practical sense give the same amount of consideration to every sentient species.  I assume most vegans possess fabrics of some type in their homes (apparel, bedding, etc.) and that they routinely launder those fabrics. If so, then they are killing untold numbers of dust mites in the process. They could just opt to not clean their clothes and sheets (yuck). While that would eventually become disgusting, I'm not sure it would pose any significant health risks (allergens for some). Yet we kill them with great discrimination every time we do a load of laundry. Additionally, head and pubic lice could probably be tolerated by their human host without them sustaining any life-threatening complications. Does that obligate us to suffer these pests?  I'm aware that this is incidental harm and not direct exploitation. For the record, I'm entirely against farmed bees for the sake of honey. However, I'm for farmed bees used to pollinate our produce and other food crops -- at least until we can come up with a better method. Vegans could forego some of the most intensively pollinated crops, but I haven't heard any voices speak up about this issue (OP did).  The consumption of bivalves by carnists doesn't irk me as much as their eating other animals considered food. I wouldn't have faulted the European villagers for killing rats during the bubonic plague. Modern grain harvesting using combines definitely kills birds, reptiles, and rodents, yet vegans readily consume cereal products. If a firefighter were to save someone from my burning home, I'd most certainly want him to show a preference to my child versus my rescued pet or even the spider I let live in the corner. Returning a beached whale to the ocean trumps a washed-up jellyfish in my book. Veterinarians aren't trained in treating cockroaches; should they be?  I'm using these examples to illustrate my own inconsistencies. Does my attitude about any of these issues really make me a speciesist? If so, then most vegans are likewise implicated.  My point being that sometimes anti-speciesism breaks down when pushed too far."
vegan,3dwvps,felinebeeline,3,Mon Jul 20 11:34:29 2015 UTC,"I wasn't making an issue of the sponges, though.    Does my attitude about any of these issues really make me a speciesist?    No. I see a lot of confusion about what speciesism is on this subreddit, though, so I'm glad you asked.   Opposing speciesism does not mean that you are saying all sentient beings are equal to each other. Quite the opposite, it recognizes that not only is this not the case, but that not all beings within a species are equal. What do I mean by equal? I mean if in the same situation, who gets preference?  You might be wondering, then what is the problem? How do we determine what is speciesist and what isn't? How do we give equal consideration to unequal beings? We don't give the consideration based on the species, but based on how much they suffer, followed by how much hope or potential they have. For example, let's say you have two children and can only save one. They both can suffer equally, so you can't use that as a guide. However, one of them only had one month to live anyway and the other was healthy. Whom would you save?   Or, let's say you have a cortically dead infant and a healthy pig.  The pig will suffer more if you kill her, and the pig also has more potential. Whom would you save? In a non-speciesist world, the pig would be saved.    If so, then they are killing untold numbers of dust mites in the process.    How sentient are dust mites? I don't believe that the suffering you would experience by living unsanitarily is exceeded by the deaths of the dust mites.   However, I'm for farmed bees used to pollinate our produce crops -- at least until we can come up with a better method.   I don't know what other option you have aside from starving to death. That doesn't make you speciesist. And I don't think that the suffering of farmed bees exceeds the suffering that would come of us all starving, along with everyone's animal companions.    Modern grain harvesting using combines definitely kill birds, reptiles, and rodents, yet vegans readily consume cereal products.   This is going into a nirvana fallacy. Speciesism is not about being perfect. The rest of my thoughts on this are expressed above this quote.   If a firefighter were to save someone from my burning home, I'd most certainly want him to show a preference to my child versus my rescued pet or even the spider I let live in the corner.   Nothing wrong with that. Every parent wants to save their child first. You would have reason to believe that your child has at least equal ability to suffer, so why would you consider this to be speciesist? I would pick my child first as well. In fact, I would prefer for the fireman to give preference to my child over another person's child. That doesn't have anything to do with speciesism.  Edit: Forgot about this one:   Veterinarians aren't trained in treating cockroaches; should they be?   I don't think anyone takes cockroaches to the vet, so why would they be trained in that? It's like asking if vets in Alaska should specialize in emus, lest they be considered speciesists.   I hope this helps to clear up what speciesism is and what it isn't."

I mean we are obviously humans but if our brains don't work the exact same way as yours we are magically downgraded to ""edge cases"" too? You know a bee is an animal  Sentience is irrelevant. Suffering is the only relevant factor. Beekeeping makes bees suffer.  The vegan ethics edge case is plants. Because they do react to being harvested and eaten and unless they are certain fruits they don't seem to like it. But they are 100% nothing like us plus we have to eat  And why do you think the alternative to honey harvesting is only manual pollination?

It's not like it sways me from eating plants and I don't really believe they have feelings in the way that I do but they're not rocks  Some vegans eat only or mainly fruit. I think most of them are doing it for health reasons not ethical reasons but this is something that is up for debate, unlike ""are bees animals, is honey vegan"" which isn't"
vegan,3dwvps,Q7M9v,3,Mon Jul 20 11:21:47 2015 UTC,"Sure they react, but don't mix stimulus and response with sentience and experience. All living organisms are capable of responding to stimuli (I think that's one of the qualifications to be called 'life'), but only a subset have subjective experiences. To me, it's that line which matters, and it's why there's a debate about sponges earlier in this thread - they're animals but it would be hard to say they really have a subjective experience of being a sponge or to feel pain."
vegan,3dwvps,rinabean,0,Mon Jul 20 12:14:19 2015 UTC,"All we actually have is noticing if there's a response. We can't get into the heads of other creatures or even other humans.  I'm reminded of a study I read about where they were trying to measure I think if cats could be patient and methodical and make the ""right"" choice after deliberation. But they did this by putting them (and I believe they were all pet cats who had been volunteered) in a room with strings hanging from the ceiling and they were meant to pick the ""right"" one and of course they didn't. They played with all the strings. And this apparently means we can draw conclusions about cat brains other than ""they love playing with strings"". It was ridiculous. Also visual tests that suit visual humans for smell-oriented animals and so on. Yes, they aren't humans, but we already knew that. It's really arrogant to think that we who don't even understand our own brains enough to treat the majority of problems we have with them can understand other brains to the point where we can safely declare that they don't matter  I think it's safe to say that a sponge is very different to us but we really have no way to say if they feel pain and value their own lives like we do. And as there's no need for me to hurt a sponge I won't. There's no need for me to hurt a bee - I won't. I need to eat plants so I will, regardless of whether or not they feel pain. If they one day get more proof that they do then I guess I'll change what sorts I eat to minimise it but until then it's not really relevant, and I can't make those choices until then anyway.  You can't say the same about bees. We know a bit about them, we can watch them attack us to defend their honey, we don't need honey. It's not an edge case in any sense, it's black and white. The line is drawn well past bees"
vegan,3dwvps,Q7M9v,2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:55 2015 UTC,"Cool. I totally agree that the line is well past bees, and that avoiding or minimizing harm to any life form - even including plants - is a good default position for a lot of reasons from protecting ecosystems and habitats all the way to having the wisdom to know that we don't know what we don't know. :-)  It's always a fun mind bender to throw when someone tries to use 'but you kill plants' as an argument against veganism to tell them that being vegan is the way to cause the fewest plants to be harvested too - so if they care so much about plants it's time for them to give up the meat and dairy. But I digress. Fun talking with you!"
vegan,3dwvps,Versepelles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"We can observe what causes pain in humans, then extrapolate the results to other creatures, with tools like MRI. What we have found is that certain parts of the brain react when we feel pain. We thus conclude, along with further (often non-vegan) experiments, that this part of the brain is necessary for translating pain from nociceptors (specialized neurons for detecting injury). In species without neurons or analogous structures (plants), we conclude that they do not internalize stimuli in the same meaningful way as we do, because they do not have the requisite anatomy for this."
vegan,3dwvps,Versepelles,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"Sentience is relevant because it allows human ethics to be extended to other animals. We care for gorillas because we care for humans and see that gorillas are like humans- they feel pain, have social groups, and enjoy sex. However, their ability to share these traits with humans comes from a common biology, specifically an evolved brain, which we roughly call sentience. The complexity of the brain approximately determines the complexity of capacity; insects cannot be taught to put on clothes, while chimps can, and this stems from sentience. Similarly, we postulate that bacteria do not suffer as much from painful stimuli as elephants do because they lack a significant amount of sentience.  Insects do not, in general, have a huge amount of sentience, not enough to warrant too much worry, in my opinion, in the present age."

vegan,3dwvps,WritePublishDie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"In your first paragraph, it sounds as if you're confusing sentience with sapience.  I'm willing to agree that there are parts of the animal kingdom where sentience is debatable. It seems to me though that once you get to a certain rudimentary level of subjective awareness, sentience cannot be further enhanced and sapience becomes the main difference in neurological development. So I don't see the spectrum of sentience you often refer to. Sapience certainly has a broad range like that but is irrelevant when it comes to our moral stance towards our fellow animals.  Animals like jellyfish and bivalves probably aren't sentient (their use by humans is still not vegan though). Arthropods (insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans) need further scientific study to enhance our understanding of their neurology. I'm willing to extend sentience to them even based on our limited knowledge because I cannot justify causing them unnecessary harm in light of our ignorance towards them. Just because no one currently knows where the division lies between non-sentience and sentience in animals doesn't mean we should utilize those fringe species for own own sake.  Additionally, I'm committed as a vegan to stop the objectification and commodification of any sentient animals. So I'm not busy trying to find grey areas to exploit for my own benefit. I don't have a problem with the generalization that if a species belongs in the animal kingdom and has a nervous system, it deserves to be left alone. Maybe that is naive and simplistic, but as a rule of thumb it serves to stop the endless debate over whether we should or shouldn't exploit this or that type of animal."
vegan,3dwvps,Versepelles,0,Tue Jul 21 00:25:30 2015 UTC,"if a species belongs in the animal kingdom and has a nervous system, it deserves to be left alone   This is a great rule of thumb, and I agree with it. However, we must kill things to survive, presently. Rodents are killed in the fields where our veggies are grown, bugs are eradicated from the places we live and work, and we kill deer along the road from time to time. The idea here is that we, even as vegans, have a cold calculus for determining what consequences we accept for our actions, and a good part of this equation comes from the capacity of organisms experience happiness and suffering. We know that we do this because we give priority to some animals over other animals, roughly based on sentience, or sapience, or neurological complexity- however you wish to phrase it. I think a lot of debate comes from rejecting this notion, but I have yet to see a proper argument against it."
vegan,3dwvps,WritePublishDie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:42 2015 UTC,"We humans (including vegans) do discriminate based on neurological complexity, but I'm not sure that's to our credit. It's probably based on our own bias towards intelligence and a remnant of our own speciesism.  Take the case of a mouse and an elephant. Both are equally sentient, but the cognitive ability (what I termed ""sapience"" earlier) of the elephant is vastly superior to that of the mouse. Does that mean we should show the elephant more moral consideration than the mouse? I don't think we're justified in doing so. Our behavior towards these ""insignificant"" or ""lesser"" beings (e.g. the mouse) usually comes down to not just convenience and practicability, but a real prejudice towards them versus those who are more like us (e.g. the elephant).  There might be the possibility that with increased reasoning ability, suffering is increased for any particular species. However, because we have no evidence of this, we must maintain the stance on sentience alone as the great egalitarian principle that governs our veganism.  From Wikipedia: ""Sentience is the ability to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively. Eighteenth-century philosophers used the concept to distinguish the ability to think (reason) from the ability to feel (sentience).""  From Merriam-Webster: ""Feeling or sensation as distinguished from perception and thought.""  From The Free Dictionary: ""Consciousness; feeling as distinguished from perception or thought; awareness;  sense perception not involving intelligence or mental perception."""
vegan,3dwvps,Versepelles,0,Tue Jul 21 02:56:50 2015 UTC,"I think we are in the same boat now- we find that a bias towards capacity of experience is the practiced form of veganism, whether or not that has ""moral"" standing. That's reasonable.  However, the claim   There might be the possibility that with increased reasoning ability, suffering is increased for any particular species. However, because we have no evidence of this   is something I disagree with, based on the continuum of cognitive abilities along the evolutionary tree. It seems quite reasonable that just as some species have better spatial awareness than others, some have higher ""sentience"" than others- sentience does not appear to be a bit, with on and off states, but moreso an integral value, ranging from minimal to some maximum value. But, I can see that some may choose to view it simply as a characteristic held or not held to simplify decisions. Certainly, the actions implied by both systems for vegans should not differ drastically except for some ""grey areas"" of life, like lower-level organisms."
vegan,3dwvps,WritePublishDie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"Did you actually read the definitions of sentience I provided? You seem to have your own working definition that isn't congruent with the accepted one. I still think you're conflating sentience with cognitive ability.  Also, I would be open to any scientific evidence that could demonstrate the degree to which an animal suffers is directly proportional to their higher mental capacity. Feel free to post the link here as a response."
vegan,3dwvps,Versepelles,0,Tue Jul 21 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"The exact definition of cognitive abilities doesn't matter much; let's not harp on technicalities. The idea is as you expressed:   Also, I would be open to any scientific evidence that could demonstrate the degree to which an animal suffers is directly proportional to their higher mental capacity.   Here, I argue by analogy (which certainly has some limitations). Broca's area plays a key role in language formation in humans; lower primates with a less developed analogous region have lower communication skills (source). The evolutionary degree of the neocortex in mammals and homologous regions in other organisms strongly correlates with self-awareness and other high-level cognitive functions (source). There are numerous examples of how certain parts of the brain (or other neurological systems) differ between species, and how higher evolution of these specific areas equates to higher performance in the function of that area. By extension, I now claim that ""higher"" animals- that is, animals with more complex neurological systems (again, not a hard definition; there can be exceptions)- have higher abilities to experience and internalize pain, or suffer. Certainly, nociception is an evolutionary trait which seems to follow the above patterns.  It is from this that we can claim, ""bees experience pain in a less meaningful way than whales""."
vegan,3dwvps,WritePublishDie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:28:27 2015 UTC,"Your first cited source is irrelevant to the discussion.  The second one merely assumes that the mammalian neocortex is necessary for consciousness without demonstrating it.  Your last reference doesn't differentiate the degree of ""nociception"" among the primitive Animalia with nervous systems and the more highly developed mammals. (Did you notice this?)  Therefore, your conclusion (an unwarranted assertion) remains unsubstantiated and is even non sequitur given the paltry evidence you provide.  To my knowledge, there is no scientific consensus currently regarding the delineation between the not conscious and the conscious members of the animal kingdom. That doesn't mean that such a boundary doesn't exist; it just means that we don't know where it is.  Which is why it behooves vegans to eliminate such conjecture from their consideration of who we should and should not act morally towards. All sentient (including even questionably sentient) animals deserve their right to autonomy without undue interference from humans."

Similarly, insects warrant some consideration, but not as much as a gorilla, because the capacity for understanding pain is orders of magnitude lower.  To equate all all life as equal is problematic, as the taxological structure of life is ill-defined. Consider the comb jellyfish, which has a neural net but no brain. Consider the sponge, which has no neurons. Consider a carrot plant, a moss, an amoeba, and a virus.

If we suddenly didn't have all this meat around, then most of the world would starve to death! o.O  From the site:   Food scarcity is an argument for veganism, not against it. As the world’s population grows and more people are able to afford meat, less food is available overall. This is because we filter protein and energy-rich crops like soy and grain through animals at a substantial loss before eating them. Depending on the numbers you want to trust and the type of animal it comes from, each pound of meat requires four to thirteen pounds of feed to produce. By switching to a plant-based diet, the farms that presently grow that feed are able to grow food for people instead.  In all, roughly 40% of the world's arable land is used for food production, while only a quarter of that food is for human consumption. The rest, a staggering 30% of the world's arable land, is used to produce animal feed and commands a third of the world's fresh water. Worse, the meat resulting from this industrialized animal agriculture is not divided evenly. For instance, Americans eat 270 lbs. of meat a year on average, while Bangladeshis eat 4 lbs. Meanwhile, much of the world gets no food at all or raises livestock feed for export to countries with a high demand for meat, creating an unequal burden of production versus consumption between the poorest and richest people on the planet. This is why even conservative researchers are calling for a global decrease in the consumption of meat, while most are calling for the widespread adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet in order to create and sustain food security for the world's growing population. Widespread adoption of a plant-based diet would leave the Earth's arable land and fresh water for use in the production of food crops for people and not feed crops for livestock.    Of note, this fallacy is also presently available in German and Spanish."

vegan,3dvttt,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,-12,Mon Jul 20 21:50:59 2015 UTC,When will you preachy vegans learn that not everyone lives by your morals?
vegan,3dvttt,The_Real_Mongoose,10,Mon Jul 20 05:47:04 2015 UTC,Well that's just the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Obviously we know not everyone lives by our morals. That's why we are preaching. Because everyone should live by our morals.
vegan,3dvttt,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,-10,Mon Jul 20 07:12:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the problem, you try and preach your morals, and they don't work, exacly because no one is interested...   I'm interested, but I've decided against being vegan for a myriad of reasons. My point is that you're not going to convince all that many people by trying to guilt them, because it simply doesn't work. It just fills the stereotype of the preachy annoying vegan that won't shup up. That doesn't really convince people.  You say you know that omnivores don't live by your morals, but by trying to guilt them, as seen in a previous comment, you're assuming that we do."
vegan,3dvttt,felinebeeline,9,Mon Jul 20 07:27:21 2015 UTC,"You're assuming that we were born vegan. Considering most of us weren't and are now vegan, we understand better than you do what types of things bring people to make the change. You are responsible for the choice you are making, and you are here to try to justify it to yourself more than to us. Your choices are ultimately your responsibility. Until you understand that, you will continue to blame vegans for your choices."
vegan,3dvttt,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,-6,Mon Jul 20 07:35:29 2015 UTC,"Am I blaming vegans for my choices? Really? Of course not. I'm not here to try and justify anything, I don't have to, I'm here to tell you that vegans are driving people away by being overly preachy. I mean, there's always the people that end up joining, but if you want people to become vegans, the preaching just turns most of them away.   You say you understand what makes people change, which is a good point, but it's only a subset of people who HAVE changed, not everyone acts the same way, and by using guilt, you're bound to convert some people, but most of the population is not interested at all. That's what I'm saying. It requires a set of traits for people to be convinced by the methods used by those who use guilt, and most people don't have that trait.   Now, please tell me, how did you become a vegan, I'm guessing it was because you felt guilty. I assume so, because that's what vegans use to convert, but that only works on people who would feel guilty."
vegan,3dvttt,felinebeeline,9,Mon Jul 20 07:53:54 2015 UTC,"You are blaming vegans for the byproduct of the knowledge you gain. By learning why something is wrong, if you are taking part in it, you will feel guilt, unless you are exceedingly selfish. So yes, you are blaming vegans for your choices, really."
vegan,3dvttt,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,-4,Mon Jul 20 07:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not blaming anyone for my choices. I'm simply stating an observation here. I'm trying to help you guys fight the preachy vegan stereotype. Maybe that's not what you want, which is fine, but you gotta ask if it's working out for you...   Here you are trying to shame and guilt again by teling me I'm selfish for know it is morally wrong. Well first of all, it's not morally wrong, and second, and much more importantly: That's exacly what I mean, you're trying to guilt meat eats, but it hasn't been working out. I'm not blaming vegans for my choices, I'm not blaming anyone... Because there's no one to blame."
vegan,3dvttt,yourlycantbsrs,5,Mon Jul 20 14:04:30 2015 UTC,Why don't you think it's morally wrong? Have you studied ethics much?
vegan,3dvttt,felinebeeline,6,Mon Jul 20 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to help you guys fight the preachy vegan stereotype.   No, you're actually not. You are more responsible for it than anyone here. You have been consistently using the word ""preachy"" for any communications that inform people about animal exploitation. How much do you want to bet that you don't apply that term to any other situation where someone explains why they are ethically opposed to something?  You are here for one reason and it's not because you want to help us fight this or that. If you were interested in helping to grow veganism, you would be a vegan."
vegan,3dvttt,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"No, I said you preach your morals while trying to guilt people. Which would be fine, if it worked. But it evidently hasn't. That's an observation.   If you tell me about morals, I could have a discussion, but just look at the way OP's gif is presented, it's main aim is to guilt people of eating meat. Again, I got no problem with that, except that it doesn't work and throws alot of the population off.  You're right that I'm not here to spread veganism, but I'm not here to make it go away either. I'm here as a messenger from the average population to say that preaching morals to guilt people usually doesn't work. That's all."
vegan,3dvttt,felinebeeline,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"But it evidently hasn't.   According to whom? You, the non-vegan expert on veganism and what our motives are? I'm sure that all of the new vegans that pop up all the time, saying that they watched Earthlings and became vegan, are all making it up. Yes?    just look at the way OP's gif is presented, it's main aim is to guilt people of eating meat.    It's from a TV show (Bojack Horseman? I'm not sure). And it's presented to vegans in a vegan subreddit, which you voluntarily came into. You seem to have this paranoid feeling that everything we do is for you and to guilt you into something. This isn't even a guilt-inducing gif; your overall guilty feelings are making you see things that are not there. This sub presents stuff that interested omnis might think about, but it's usually us talking with each other. I find your whole schtick even weirder now, knowing that this cartoon gif is what you think is a guilt-inducing conspiracy."

Don't you think it'll just drive people away, since not everyone wants to live by your non-preachy morals?"

I'm advising you guys that while it was valid to you, it's not valid for most people. And that's why the stereotype exists. So no, it won't drive people away, or at least it shouldn't if you guys are consistent.

vegan,3dwciu,be_kind_to_animals,19,Mon Jul 20 02:05:45 2015 UTC,I think if you keep lots of vegan food that's convenient and easy for him to prepare and ask him to keep any of his non-vegan food stored separately he'll eventually start eating mostly vegan just out of convenience and to save money. I'm not sure it's wise to make a big deal out of it unless he's being disrespectful.
vegan,3dwciu,bird_person19,7,Mon Jul 20 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Colleen Patrick Goudreau talks about this a lot in her podcast. She keeps a completely vegan household and does not allow animal products in. She's told a couple of stories of parties that she's thrown and people bringing in non-vegan dishes, etc. If you search through her episode list you can find a few covering the topic.   http://www.joyfulvegan.com/podcast-radio  I'm of the opinion that it's your house, your rules. There's definitely  a way you can go about it that won't make you look like ""that vegan asshole"". You aren't preventing him from consuming his foods of choice outside of the home, just requesting that they stay outside of the home.   Teenagers are selfish by default, but I think if you go about it in a ""having non-vegan products in our home is very upsetting to us and we respectfully request that you don't bring them in"". There will be accidents and mistakes and you'll just need to provide a gentle reminder."
vegan,3dwciu,deeepseadiver,17,Mon Jul 20 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"Give him a drawer, like one of the crispers in the fridge, and have that be the animal product zone. Drop $50 bucks on a dedicated frying pan and pot."
vegan,3dwciu,satosaison,9,Mon Jul 20 02:31:10 2015 UTC,"I like this idea. Making the house a 100% vegan zone will be alienating for him at a time when you are hoping to get to know him better and develop a relationship with him. Having a special drawer and meat-only cooking equipment sets some boundaries and is a reasonable compromise without being alienating. Of course, by virtue of having you or your partner cook for him occasionally, he will likely have some increased opportunities to enjoy vegan meals."
vegan,3dwciu,jogam,9,Mon Jul 20 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"This is a good idea. I would still like to encourage him to eat more vegan food and less of the alternative, but I can probably do that with suggestions rather than rules."
vegan,3dwciu,satosaison,22,Mon Jul 20 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"Cook vegan food, if he wants none vegan food he can cook for himself. How often will he choose meat over convenience? I never would have as a teen."
vegan,3dwciu,Versepelles,10,Mon Jul 20 02:45:25 2015 UTC,"A dedicated minifridge could also work. However, do be aware that settings boundaries creates an exclusory environment, which can be highly detrimental in forming relations. Veganism is very important, but this is something of a dangerous game and should be played cautiously. Just keep in mind that you wish the best for both your new family and your animal friends, and the situation should resolve itself as best it can."
vegan,3dwciu,britta_it_again,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:11 2015 UTC,I agree. Most of my friends are not vegan and to keep the friendship I don't judge and just hope they see me as a good example that they want to follow. Talking about veganism can be as touchy as politics or religion and so I treat it like that and discuss my views but am considerate of others so I don't hurt their feelings.
vegan,3dwciu,mousekears,4,Mon Jul 20 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"Just set boundaries. He can have a drawer/shelf/minifrig/separate pan/etc for animal products, but let him know all meals you cook will not have any animal products. And he is welcome to have any plant milk, vegan snacks, etc that is for the household. That's a fair compromise. He needs to have a little control over his own food and chances are he might not bother, after a while. He will become used to having vegan food around and get past whatever his diet was before. Maybe.   Personally when my fiancé wasn't vegan, I just told him I'm cooking nothing but vegan for him, no meat in my area. He's welcome to have whatever he wants when he goes out to eat and whenever he sees his parents and eats with them. My friend has a similar thing for her husband. My fiancé is vegan now. I think her husband is too. But that's more intimate relationship.... Just talk to him."
vegan,3dwciu,mavienoire,3,Mon Jul 20 10:32:05 2015 UTC,I think that your husband makes a point in that it might incite a bit of negativity if you start off so strong. He is coming to live with you (which is awesome of you btw) but you don't want to make his new home a place he feels he is walking on egg shells. Maybe explain to him that you don't buy animal products but he is free to eat your food.
vegan,3dwciu,Vishika,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"Your need to feel comfortable in your own home as a safe animal product free place is very valid, so are your husbands concerns. I think it's possible to be firm about not wanting animal products without coming off as an extremist and alienating him. Try sitting down and talking it over with him, let him know that you don't be controlling, but that it is really important to you. Perhaps you will allow him to keep non perishables and takeaways in his room? I could not be reasoned with at that age... but it's probably worth a try. Good luck. :)"
vegan,3dwciu,rinabean,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:50 2015 UTC,"If he wants to go out and have a burger he can. it's not like you're literally forcing him to be vegan. Are you planning to make meals as a family? Cooking separately seems ridiculous unless you're all working funny shifts but even then you should be using slow cookers, freezer  It's not at all ridiculous to want control over your own kitchen. And he should realise that these are the things that happen when you're an adult and you live with people."
vegan,3dwciu,airwaveraid87,3,Mon Jul 20 10:27:25 2015 UTC,"You don't own your kid. Let him make his own decisions. Present your argument for veganism, and then leave it up to him. Anybody parroting that 'My house, my rules' bullshit probably have kids that hate them.  If you force him to be vegan when he doesn't want to, it's almost guaranteed that he'll ditch it the moment he leaves the house. If you want it to stick, then treat him like an adult.  The suggestions about separate fridge spaces and pans are good ideas."

To keep your skin tight(er) after losing weight, stay hydrated, make sure your diet isn't TOO low fat (fat helps your skin stay supple), use lotion 2x daily, do strength training, and don't lose too fast (not more than 2lbs per week).

That's a good point about the body making it... when I was searching for ""vegan"" collagen, I kept finding things like ""10 foods to boost your collagen"" and they were pretty much everything vegans eat (beans, berries, and other exotic things we eat) and then turkey so it's telling that they basically say ""eat what vegans eat and also choose one of the less-unhealthy meats"".

Vegetarianism is very widespread here and finding food is not difficult.  However, there isn't really a clear word (or Chinese characters) for vegan, and I have seen restaurants use the word vegan (in English) when they really just mean vegetarian, probably because they don't understand the translation.  Taiwanese people also seem to have a hard time understanding that products such as mayonnaise contain egg or other animal ingredients.  They seem to disregard hidden ingredients like this and only consider the ingredients they are cooking with themselves.  So if they don't actually crack open an egg in the kitchen, the dish has 'no egg'.  There are also many street markets selling fresh produce."

I was raised in a very rural area, moved to a nearby college town (which is where I actually went vegan), and then last year moved to Seattle.   Seattle is probably one of those most vegan-friendly cities ever, so that's rather nice. There are like two dozen all vegan restaurants, plus vegan options are pretty normal at other restaurants. It seems like every neighborhood has a farmers' market weekly, though not all are year round.   Where I moved from only had one vegan restaurant, and that was several years after I went vegan, but there were definitely some decent vegan options at some of the omni-restaurants there and I could find some stuff like vegan yogurt and ice cream at some grocery stores. There were a couple farmers' markets and one in particular that I really liked. There were ready-to-eat vegan food options there, including one place that was all vegan.    There weren't even many restaurants nearby where I grew up. I was in high school, I think, when we got a McDonald's and that was kind of a big deal. We had one grocery store nearby. There was a produce stand sometimes, but no farmers' market nearby that I remember. I would still not call that area vegan-friendly and I'm really, really glad for many reasons that I no longer live there. I would still be vegan if I had to move back, and it's doable, but I definitely sympathize for anyone who has to be vegan in such an area."

vegan,3dvts0,ryan6292,11,Sun Jul 19 23:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the cows being injected with hormones that we have a problem with. Cows only give milk when they have been pregnant, so they are impregnated every year. When they give birth, their calves are useless to the industry so they are either killed after a few days, sold to a beef farm, raised for veal, or grown into replacement dairy cows. The ones that are kept are usually fed reject milk that is not suitable for human consumption (eg from cows with mastitis), and are kept separate from their mothers so that all the milk can be sold for humans.   Dairy cows have been bred to produce ridiculous amounts of milk, to the point that shortly after birth they may become paralysed due to excessively low calcium levels (calcium is required for muscle function.) They lie on the ground until they can be given IV calcium, and if this doesn't occur quickly they can bloat up, obtain severe muscle damage, and die. This is called ""milk fever"" and is relatively common, and entirely due to humans breeding them this way.  Dairy cows also deal with lameness from walking on concrete. If they're kept indoors they're often on concrete all the time, but even if they're outdoor cows they must come in to be milked multiple times/day. Lameness is common, and often not addressed until it becomes severe.   Environmentally, dairy is also pretty terrible. Cows raised for milk produce lots of methane, just like beef animals, contributing to climate change. A lot of water is required to give the animals and to keep the milking shed and surrounding area clean. Fertilisers are used on outdoor fields which cause runoff into waterways. And of course, it's a highly inefficient way to produce food. It takes more input food, whether it's grazed grass or bought-in crops, to get a smaller amount of output milk."

vegan,3dvts0,Gain_Grain,7,Mon Jul 20 20:50:21 2015 UTC,"Free-range eggs, or organic, or whatever popular term is out there today is highly unregulated. It can mean chickens chilling outside in the grass, but it can also mean chickens kept in a barn with a tiny door that leads to a small concrete runoff outside. ""Organic"" mostly has to do with the food that is being fed, and in all animal situations can end up being a negative in terms of welfare. Under the organic label, use of antibiotics and many other drugs is not allowed unless you take treated animals out of the system. So an animal with a terrible infection may not be treated in a timely manner or at all because of the desire for them to remain organic and saleable. (The organic rules usually explicitly prohibit treatments from being withheld in the interest of keeping the animal organic, but it's a pretty perverse incentive and I have seen some things...)  Even if you're eating eggs from your nextdoor neighbor who grows them in her backyard, it's still not very ethical. Where did those chickens come from? Usually breeders who sell chickens to the industries you're trying to avoid. What happens to the males? There is no use for them in the egg industry, regardless of how 'humanely' the hens are treated.   Hens have been bred to lay far more eggs than their bodies can really support. I had an expert on chickens tell me that, ""Chickens will lay one last egg before they die."" Their reproductive systems will not shut down to save their own lives because we have bred them that way.   Most chickens end up being very low on calcium, because it all gets deposited into the eggshells. This causes them to have very weak bones, which are easily broken. The quality of the eggs produced also goes down over time, so most chickens are not kept for more than 1, or at most a couple of laying cycles, then they are killed.   Some people think it's ok to eat eggs from chickens who ""would lay them anyway."" This is common in backyard or rescue situations. In reality, the chicken is only laying more eggs because you keep taking them away. Many birds will stop when they are able to complete a 'clutch' of 10 or so eggs, then they will switch into 'brooding' mode and try to raise them (even if they are unfertilised.) Sometimes, because of their genetics, they will still not stop laying unless given hormonal treatment, but this should be done to keep them from literally laying themselves to death.  These things are problems regardless of the way you raise the birds."
vegan,3dvts0,Gain_Grain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"Why are chickens injected with the drugs? does it maximise the amount of eggs they can produce or is it so they get bigger for when/if they get slaughtered for meat? Or are chickens exasperated into ones that produce eggs and ones that are for meat?    Sometimes, because of their genetics, they will still not stop laying unless given hormonal treatment, but this should be done to keep them from literally laying themselves to death.    Does this mean that organic chickens lay themselves to death?"
vegan,3dvts0,rinabean,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"Chickens are not generally given hormones, this is a common myth. The enlargement of chickens and the increase in their egg production over time is all due to breeding.   Most chickens are given antibiotics to control infection spread in such close conditions. Because organic farmers cannot use these drugs, they do tend to have fewer chickens in a larger space, which lowers infection rates. However, when they do occur, the farmer is in trouble and has to make some hard choices.  Organic chickens are the same animals as non-organic chickens, they're just fed different food and managed differently. They'll have the same genetic problems as any other chickens. Chickens don't generally get the opportunity to lay themselves to death, because they are killed after a laying cycle or two. It's the 'rescued' animals that usually face this problem, or if they get sick. A sick chicken will keep laying eggs in spite of needing those nutrients for itself."
vegan,3dvts0,syringaferonia,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right to be skeptical of ""free range"" labels. A business model that allows people to supply dozens and dozens of eggs to every supermarket in the country, for a very cheap price, while giving their chickens genuine free range conditions simply does not exist. The Happy Egg Company and the like are just using classic marketing tactics. Legally, free range means they have a few square feet per chicken to move around in. Not fantastic."

They're not 'invading', they don't have a concept of property rights, and they would probably consider it extreme to be exterminated when they're simply doing ant stuff, looking for food etc. It could just be a semantic issue, but I don't consider it a right to destroy any sentient beings that happen to be in my house.  I would try some natural deterrents first."
vegan,3dw1hv,phybron,0,Mon Jul 20 02:43:38 2015 UTC,"sentient beings   Calling ants sentient may be a bit far-reaching. Certainly, they are not without value, but it's probably better to use the 'accordance' principle- every organism should be treated with respect in accordance with their intelligence.  This implies that while natural deterrents are a good start, if that doesn't work, well, sorry ants."

There are no clear lines to draw for what is and what is not worthy of consideration. In fact, we will soon have to address whether meat tissue grown on racks has enough of a neurological system to constitute a a violation of vegan ethics, and then we will have to consider how to treat cyborgs, AI systems, and memory replicants.

The first option runs into problems when you consider a bug versus an elephant, and also when you define what constitutes an animal.  The second option runs into problems when trying to value life, as we are inclined to love all things as vegans. However, this view seems more logically consistent, even though it may be hard to digest and implement well.  For humans to live, currently, some lives must be sacrificed, and, as vegans, we want to minimize that death and suffering, so we must make hard choices."

I would agree, except ants aren't sentient, and neither are plants, so it's equally irrelevant to both circumstances.

vegan,3dw1hv,andjok,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:43 2015 UTC,"there's not really evidence that insects experience pain or ""suffer"" in any way. That said, they are sentient in the sense that they observe stimuli, process said stimuli, and make decisions based on those stimuli. They're not meaty robots, but they're not on the same level as dogs or cats or pigs or chickens or octopuses."
vegan,3dw1hv,Diabroticavirgifera,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"Sentience implies the ability to suffer, as sentience means that a being has things that they want or prefer.

vegan,3dw1hv,andjok,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"Right, but it's also inconclusive as to whether plants suffer.  Why assume it's wrong to kill ants because it's inconclusive that they suffer but not assume the same of plants?"
vegan,3dw1hv,chessguy44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:58 2015 UTC,No it's not. Plants don't have any sort of brain or nervous system. Insects do.
vegan,3dw1hv,andjok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"How does that make it conclusive that they don't suffer?  There are critical components to our suffering and the suffering of other mammals and birds that we know ants don't have, such as nociception. They are already below the threshold of our scientific understanding of suffering.  Plants furthermore don't have a CNS. They are also below this threshold, and seem even circumstantially further. Yet, as I pointed out, our understanding of the ability to suffer is that it is obtained in the case of a series of necessary conditions.  Logically, if x is a being, s(x) denotes ability to suffer, n(x) denotes possession of the nociception property, and c(x) denotes having a CNS, then our understanding of science is such that:  s(x) implies both n(x) and c(x)  equivalently,  not n(x) OR not c(x) implies not s(x)  Thus, the lack of obtainment of either condition in the case of plants is not really important, as s(x) is false if either condition is false.  You might say that this is a matter of probability, and that between two circumstances below, A is more likely than B.  A. a being with a CNS but no nociception changes our understanding of how suffering works to include some beings without nociception.  B. a being without a CNS or nociception changes our understanding to include some beings without either.  But here are a couple objections to that claim.   Changing our understanding of suffering would require empirical observation of a counterexample, i.e. some x for which  not n(x) but still s(x). Yet to determine whether a being suffers we always look at nociception. How will we realize we are wrong about this when the method for checking whether we are wrong would presuppose its correctness? If you'd claim A is more likely than B, how would you justify that? It seems insanely hard to justify."
vegan,3dw1hv,chessguy44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"we may be using suffer in different ways. There isn't evidence to suggest that insects feel emotion (except perhaps fear, but it's debatable whether fear in this context would be considered an emotion). Pain and suffering in an emotional context aren't necessarily the same thing as nociception and experiencing physical damage. :)"
vegan,3dw1hv,Diabroticavirgifera,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yes I suppose so. I thought they were sentient, given they can perceive external stimuli and have a basic nervous system. Maybe they don't get sad though.  Anyway the point is, I would try to deter them before killing them. That's really all. I should've just said that."
vegan,3dw1hv,phybron,2,Mon Jul 20 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"Prevention is key. You should try to keep your house clean to avoid infestations. However, last time I had ants, I sprinkled cinnamon where they were coming in and that worked amazingly to make them go away. Killing them should be a last resort."
vegan,3dw1hv,andjok,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"Small animals are routinely killed by habitat destruction, especially in agricultural areas, so that we can have veggies and places to live. I generally kill roaches, ants, and termites which come into my home, so that my apartment can be a home (for me). In the wild, I would generally not kill these same animals. Geckos, though, I capture and put outside. Insects are a boundary case of veganism; I don't think they should cause too much worry one way or another. (Certainly, we need and love insects, just not in our houses or food.)  Also, insects probably do not interpret pain as we do."
vegan,3dw1hv,Versepelles,2,Mon Jul 20 05:10:41 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents:   I have respect for all living creatures. However, when they start intruding in my space it becomes an issue. We, as vegans, have to realize that we cannot live in a world where at some point we do not cause harm upon another creature. It is going to happen. The point is to make the most practical decision. Do you want an ant infestation? No. I had fruit flies. I did what I had to. Do I feel bad? Yes. We have to mourn their loss, but realize that sometimes our comfort does come first. Yes, there are humane ways, but sometimes those just will not suffice. It's okay. You're still a compassionate being doing the best that you can. It's okay."

Wipe down counters and mop the floor - they might be after invisible syrupy stuff you have split or little crumbs. Everything in sealed jars or packets, even in cupboards, they'll last better anyway.

Not just financially but also in terms of available sq ft, IKEA furniture fits really well in small apartments and there really isint anything cost competitive that can make the same claim (unless someone can link a place for me, I'd live to shop there as well!). I should also add that for cheap particle board furniture it holds up extremely well, it's definitely not Walmart particle board furniture. They also sell a few soft wood furniture items that are 100% wood that also hold up extremely well. In fact if your willing to spend more money they do have solid wood furniture that's hard wood. I think the appeal for me is it generally works great for small spaces, and I have always lived in extremely small spaces being in the city and all."
vegan,3dw3ah,reallyokfinewhatever,8,Mon Jul 20 00:42:32 2015 UTC,"If you do eat meat I honestly think that restrictions on which particular animals you will and won't eat are pretty ridiculous, so if you're fine eating a cow, a horse should be no problem, really.

EDIT: Also, the number of people saying that eating horses would be ""a better alternative"" for unwanted horses that would ""otherwise starve.""

vegan,3dw3ah,carbonarbonoxide,7,Mon Jul 20 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to get into the eating-meat debate here because I respect the community for what it is. But let me attempt to explain the logic behind why some horse people are okay with it:  Horses walk an interesting line between what most ""horse people"" consider ""pet"" and ""livestock""- they have emotional value, but also a high monetary value. They don't live in the house, they are not for everyone (many people hate and/or are afraid of them), and they are EXPENSIVE in terms of both time and money.  They are expensive to feed/care for, in both money and time/effort. People who own or want to own horses HAVE to justify that expense somehow. Because they are a big time/money committment, this can lead to non-valuable horses (who through poor breeding or training or even age/injury are not useful or safe for the purpose of riding/whatever) having no place to go, and becoming at-risk for starvation, abuse, and slaughter because Po-Dunk JimBobJoe bought a non-ideal horse for his kids who didn't ride it because it's mean/whatever, and now can't afford the care for Pony because now the kids want an X-Box instead of vet care for their pony.  The argument for slaughter/consumption is that it would give these otherwise useless horses a ""purpose"" and an intrinsic economic value and therefore an incentive for an otherwise incapable/irresponsible owner to NOT simply not care for them.  I know none of it is anything you agree with, but I don't want you all thinking we are so crazy we would eat our pets."
vegan,3dw3ah,Puddock,2,Mon Jul 20 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"The only pro about legalising horse slaughter is somebody will go around and put some or all of them out of their misery. I've seen the suffering in the horse world and from a welfare perspective a quick death now would be a blessing.  I've seen foals torn from their mothers at mere weeks old and dumped miles away from home to starve simply for having the wrong shape of back or weak feet. Horses with poor conformation (unrideable) are not just neglected, but often abused. Best case is they're killed quickly. Average case is severe neglect and worst case is a lifetime of torture as they're sold cheaply to bad homes and ridden or driven anyway. Pain makes a horse understandably sour which impacts how it can be sold. Sour horses, in turn, are beaten or twitched into submission because proper training is hard and nobody who trains properly buys a horse with poor conformation. It's sickening! You must get some sense of how bad the situation is that slaughter and consumption  actually seems like a good idea!  It makes me so mad and sad. I believe in animal rights, and I don't think an animal should ever be killed unless for mercy but I can't square up my beliefs here with the obvious welfare improvements. It's a short term fix, but it feels better than nothing. I can't rescue everyone."
vegan,3dw3ah,theawesomestest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:53:27 2015 UTC,"The reality is horses are processed for meat, but not in the US. So the horses that are purchased in the US for slaughter have to travel for several hours or even days in a cramped trailer with no food or water until they arrive in the meat processing plant in Canada or Mexico. Many animal rights groups support the humane slaughter of horses in the US to prevent the terrible conditions that the horses endure on their way to the slaughter house. What is worse, killing the animal for consumption or letting is suffer for days before killing it for consumption?"

To play devil's advocate, if I presented this to a non-vegan, couldn't they ask where do we draw the line about killing a living thing ie. instead of a pig, what about a frog, or a bee or an oyster, or a plant.  Obviously for us vegans it just seems right to consume just plants, but is there any logical reason why we couldn't also add shellfish?  Again, just playing devil's advocate - I'm a longtime vegan and I seem to have a moral compass that points to just consuming plant based products. Consuming anything beyond plants, like shellfish, even though they may not have a central nervous system just doesn't appeal in any way - but there's also an intuitive sense that shellfish are probably a higher form of life than plants (ie. they seem to be more interactive with their surroundings). I'm sure there's some scientific basis to that as well.  But if I'm relying on an intuitive sense of what's right and wrong to eat (which I kind of am) - then everyone's intuition and moral compass varies so much that we couldn't ever provide a compelling argument to most people based on videos such as this one.  Sorry, this turned into a bit of a ramble..."
vegan,3dui2z,mbruder,4,Sun Jul 19 21:20:49 2015 UTC,I think that people rarely become vegan without having been through something a lot like the reasoning process of this video.

I can remember one specific discussion, which almost exactly went like the video. At the end I forced one person into the position, that they simply don't care, because they could only accept my arguments and conclusions. Sadly, there is no argument against that, but it showed me, that either I have the wrong friends, or that habbits and beliefs, of which many humans know, how bad they are, are rather wrongly defended, than given up.  tl;dr having the right arguments is not enough against habits and beliefs"
vegan,3dui2z,BRINGtheCANNOLI,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"It's not very compelling at all: The video tries to pass it off as if it is immoral for an alien species, or just a predatory species, to kill us for food. Which is nonsense, other animals DO NOT live by any of our morals, and would use us as food.   I'm aware that he addressed the issue by saying that we shouldn't hit a kid because he hit us. But that's missing the point, we don't eat meat because animals would do the same, in fact we don't even eat meat of the animals that do the same. We eat meat because it's the way we evolved. And yes, I know that we don't NEED to eat meat in order to survive in today's world, but that doesn't make it any less true that we evolved to eat meat. And there's no moral reason for us to stop doing so.  In the end the video needs to jump to conclusion that being of different species isn't a valid reason, even though it is. For me every living being's life is equal, be it a microbe to a human or anything else. We need to kill other species for our survival. It's just that vegans prefer animals to everything else."
vegan,3dui2z,Life-in-Death,4,Mon Jul 20 06:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well I think ""there's no moral reason for us to stop"" eating meat argument is pretty easy to counter.  I don't think anyone can deny that eating meat enables large scale environmental damage, as well as suffering of millions (billions?) of factory farmed animals.   Is it wrong to kick a dog? I think the majority of folks would agree that it's morally wrong to kick a dog, because it causes suffering. So why should it be any different for farmed animals?  There clearly are moral reasons to stop eating meat, it's just some people seem more empathetic than others, and about what they allow to impinge on their conscience on a day to day basis."

vegan,3dw0od,itrytowrite1,7,Mon Jul 20 00:18:54 2015 UTC,"Those are fruit flies.  If you don't want to kill them build a trap using a 2L cola bottle.   cut the top off and make a funnel out of paper with about a 2cm hole at the bottom.    Drop a peice of banana or any other sweet fruit into the bottom of the bottle then tape the paper funnel in hole of the 2L bottle.  Make sure you have a tight seal with the paper funnel opening several centimeteres above the banana peice.  Fruit flies are stupid.  They will fly in to get that tasty banana but won't be able to figure out how to get out.  Release them into the wild, however several will already be dead, their life span is pretty short.  Also to make the trap lucritive you need to ensure that you have fully cleaned.  Take out the garbage, wipe down surfaces, do dishes.  Ensure there is nothing laying around that is tastier than y our bottle banana."

We can create more subreddits but getting people to see the posts is a bit more challenging.

I want something creamy and cooling but cheese just isn't what I want anymore... think think think... I got it!""  I then grab my vanilla-coconut milk ice cream from the freezer and dollop a lovely tablespoon on my mini pizza and try tasting again. It's perfect.

Austin and Dallas/Ft Worth, TX have a few vegan restaurants and are relatively low cost of living. Honolulu, HI, has a few restaurants but very high cost of living.  Generally, the middle states (from wyoming to texas) have a lower cost of living but also lower opportunities. The coastal states, especially the northern ones, have higher cost of living but better opportunities. Washington (the state, not the capitol) and Oregon in particular are known as being hippie and vegan-friendly.  One month of rent can vary from $400 to $1000 for a single apartment. If you are low on cash, consider finding roommates through the internet (Craigslist, or local apartment finders).  My advice would be to keep your options open; many people in transition stages work at various retail places, but again, this is usually at minimum wage without insurance or other benefits."

They would have every right to exclude me from their list of potential candidates.  In the same way, I would never date a racist, sexist, or heterosexist with the hope that I could transform them into a suitable partner just to procure a healthy romantic relationship for myself.  I'm certainly willing though to influence friends and family regarding veganism (and have). If one of those female friends made the transition to veganism then our core values would be compatible enough for me to consider dating them.  So it isn't about my ""being considerate and compassionate"" enough. Besides, I think it's a terrible idea to date someone in order to change them to what you want them to be. It does them a real disservice and has the potential to cause considerable emotional damage.  If you have no problem dating an omni, then good for you. I was speaking only for myself."

Without applying those qualities (consideration and compassion) to non-human animals as well as humans, I'm still left with a speciesist who participates in harming others. I would hope she could see that those virtues should extend to all sentient beings.  I'd be as patient as I could, but if she refused to accept veganism as the moral baseline then any potential for a romantic relationship would be destroyed."

vegan,3dtlbz,WritePublishDie,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:38:07 2015 UTC,This is a terrible mindset. Most people just do what they're used to. You changed. Why can't they? I think a better indication is how they react to veganism. The last longer relationship I was in was with an omni but one who was open to veganism and would basically only eat vegan when with me. Set an example and people follow. You're not helping veganism by keeping it to vegans.

She would have been exposed to the vegan message by me in the most effective way I could deliver. She would have an extended period in which to resolve the internal conflict between her indoctrinated mindset and the more ethical way.  If I really cared about her, I could possibly wait years with her as a friend to see if she was able to overcome her speciesism. I would rather have been a good friend to her and been more effective in her transition than insist on a relationship and risk the possibility of her making the shift to veganism just to be with me."

We started dating last September after knowing each other for 2 years. I went vegan last December, and things sort of went downhill from there.   She enjoys eating vegan food, and she more or less supported my new lifestyle until we had a heated debate about ethics. She concluded that it was idiotic to be upset about animal suffering when human suffering is rampart, and that livestock being domesticated is reason enough to consume them. These were reasons enough to not care about animals. I'm not always the most concise writer, but I contested these points the best I could.  It was sad that it turned of the way it did. I still have a hard time believing her apathy to the plight of animals; she's always been a caring person. When we watched violent movies together, she'd shelter her eyes from fictional bad guys getting shot. But even knowing the horrors of factory farming, she willfully chooses to be a part of it.  <end of structure-less rant>"

It's not too hard to get enough protein, but if there's no reason not to drink the milk with more protein...  Because of its high protein content, it also seems to work best as a creamer in coffee/tea. Haven't had much success with other plant milks as creamers."

Half coconut and half soy is good but has a soy-y taste not great for everything, half coconut and half almond is good and can even be bought in the store but doesn't help you much, half coconut and half sunflower might be my favorite.

vegan,3du3ak,Elliotrosemary,5,Sun Jul 19 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, coconut milk is the least water-intensive, IIRC -- actually single digits... but I personally hate the flavor.  My favorite non-almond milks are soy and rice.   Really, the ""problem"" with almond milk is that the almonds are grown in California, not that ~23 gallons is a particularly large water footprint.  It's seriously tiny.   Basically all non-water, non-coconut milk beverages are in at least the double-digits on water footprint... and a lot of the beverages people drink most are over 100 gallons of water per glass (soda, beer, wine, etc.).  Don't worry about the almonds.  Seriously.  California's central valley is unique and one of the most effective agricultural locations in the world:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)  Given a unique location like that we should be making the most of it by growing crops.  However, the crops we should be growing are things for human consumption, things like tomatoes, almonds, grapes, and asparagus... not things like alfalfa sprouts for Californian livestock.  Animal agriculture, though?  There's nothing about California (except farm subsidies, and ""that's where we're doing it now"") that makes it particularly suitable for raising animals.  There's no inherent value to the land there for that purpose... and it's insanely wasteful to have over 5 million cattle consuming the limited resources there.  If California's animal agriculture ended overnight, there wouldn't be a water deficit.  We'd actually be replenishing the water reserves.  So, really... don't worry about the handful of almonds that go into a gallon of almond milk."

vegan,3drl7f,Brusswole_Sprouts,3,Sat Jul 18 21:57:40 2015 UTC,"Awesome post. I just though i'd add one I recently thought of for people who say vegan food doesn't taste good.  The reason vegan food isn't perceived as tasting good is because all the major food production firms (which is changing more and more everyday!) use animal products. Therefore, based on economic concepts of competition in the free market, these firms are working tirelessly each day to become more efficient and superior to other firms in some way. Therefore, the products they develop, which contain animal products, are constantly being refined for flavor and cost.   Now that veganism is growing, there is a market for firms such as Hampton Creek who have an incentive to create delicious, affordable vegan foods. Essentially, it is not that vegan food is innately less palatable; it is merely that popular corporations have grown and developed based on their production of animal food products. Put in the same model, vegan food production companies can be equally as innovative and make equally delicious food. (or you can make it yourself :) )"

Just eat plenty of chia seeds and sesame seeds! Seriously, 1/4 cup of each together is 60% of you calcium needs (plus chia gives you tons of important omega 3s, iron, and vitamin K)."
vegan,3drl7f,UisceDhiaga,-9,Sun Jul 19 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to advocate for eating meat. In fact I would actually prefer a vegan diet over my current one, it's not possible to switch at the moment. I just wanted to point out a couple holes in the arguments presented.   As a Christian I would argue that it's more un-natural to eat meat because humans were designed to have a vegan diet and didn't eat and likely no dairy for (going off the ages listed in the genealogy in the Genesis) at least the first 1000 years or so.   we never had any biological requirement to include meat as part of our diet, and certainly less so in contemporary times with modern knowledge about nutrition.   This isn't true. Meat has a much higher calorie density than vegetables. That calorie density was very important during the ice ages because through the consumption of meat it is easier to build up caloric reserves that were used to help keep warm and provide a store of energy so one could go a longer period of time without eating if food was scarce. This is pretty much stated in argument E2.   Our teeth prove that we are opportunistic omnivores. Nothing more. In fact, there are many features of our bodies that show we evolved to eat far less meat than most other omnivores. This is in line with our nearest neighbor, the chimpanzee, which will only eat meat occasionally, despite large sharp canines.   The canines of chimps and other herbivores are so large because those canines are used for defense. They have very little, if anything, to do with the diets of those animals. If you actually compare the canines of herbivores to those of carnivores the canines of the herbivores are actually pretty dull but can still tear through flesh because of the strength of their jaws.   On factory farms, dairy cows are artificially inseminated so that they constantly have milk. They also have their calf taken away from them immediately after birth   Some factory farms may separate the calf from the mother immediately after birth but I know for a fact that some do not until the calf is weaned. I'm pretty sure that bit about cows being artificially inseminated is false. Bovine, just like humans and other mammals, will continue to produce milk for as long as milk is taken. They do not automatically stop at about 6-7 months because the calf is weaned just like humans do not automatically stop after 12 months because they no longer need to breastfeed.   Yes, wild animals die in the machine harvesting of all crops.   Not all wild animals are killed during harvesting due to the machinery. Farmers will kill invasive wild animals such as rabbits and hogs that like to dig up roots and get into other crops. But we could completely eliminate this by switching to vertical farming or building indoor aeroponics and hydroponics farms.   And for every hunter who claims to use every portion of their kill, there are a thousand more who only eat some of the muscle and occasionally nail the head on their wall.   Hypothetically, let's say I'm a hunter that uses every part of the animal. Is it wrong for me to hunt just because other hunters let some of the flesh from the animal go to waste and goes to a taxidermist to preserve another part of that animal?   But hunters do not look for the ""easy kill"". They look for the ""trophy kill"".   This isn't entirely true. Yes, there are hunters out there that look for the ""trophy kill"" but there are just as many hunters out there that look for the ""easy kill"".  If the meat harvested from the hunt is properly cleaned and cured the risk of acquiring a disease during consumption is extremely low to none. Saying all hunters look for the ""trophy kill"" is a generalisation and shouldn't be made.   Contrary to what you might think, though, most vegans are not loud about their food, and on occasion may simply try to educate carnists about the choices they make. This can be touching a sensitive nerve in the carnist, most likely due to the fact that the carnist wishes to remain ignorant about the awful truth of their meat.   Sorry to burst your bubble, but this is wrong. It's not because people want to be ignorant to the truth. It is because 90% of the time the vegan tries to ""educate carnists about the choices they make"" they come off as arrogant and preachy and their whole attitude says ""I'm better than you because you eat meat and I don't"" or ""my moral standing is superior to yours"". Not to mention the person that is being ""educated"" already knows about the meat industry and everything that goes on in that industry because they grew up around it. It's never just an occasional thing either. It's every single time they sit down to eat a meal that has some dish with meat. I realise and fully understand that not all people may be like that, but this is just my own personal experience."
vegan,3drl7f,AbomodA,12,Sun Jul 19 02:02:16 2015 UTC,"Of course that's all you've noticed, because every vegan who doesn't go on about their choices wouldn't talk about it, so you wouldn't know.   And honestly, even when I try to not mention it - think about how important food is in social situations. It's a topic that always comes up.   Friends get annoyed when I won't eat the stuff they eat. Just last night my friends wanted to get donuts, but then they said ""Oh wait, you can't have those. I guess we won't go then"" like idgaf if they want to get donuts, I won't have them but I'm not stopping anyone else from eating them.   If I suggest a place with vegan options, I'm being ""pushy"", if I don't and then can't eat anything, they go on about feeling bad that I'm not eating, then they're annoyed that they ""have"" to choose somewhere with vegan options, if I bring vegan food to share people insult/refuse to try it, if I bring vegan food for myself I'm being rude by not sharing. Just existing = being pushy."

There's a vegan donut shop where I live so if I want donuts and have vegan friends with me we're all happy.  Personally, and I'll do this now though I use not to, if I'm with someone and I know that they're a vegan I will go out of my way to find a place that has vegan options and will often get one of those options out of respect for them.

Is it a stereotype? Sure, but stereotypes only exist for a reason. I grew up in an area where there's pretty much only ranch and farm land. Meeting people that made it known they were vegan was a pretty rare occurrence and 90% of the ones I did meet came off as arrogant and preachy.  Okay, I was wrong about the insemination.

Reading your comment with that mindset, there's no reason for me to assume that you're not generalizing until the last sentence, which, at that point, sounds less like a genuine sentiment and more like a statement put in as an afterthought to cover your ass.  That you then responded to potted_petunias' comment with ""Stereotypes exist for a reason"" implied that you did, in fact, think it was fair to generalize in such a way. That phrase is generally used by people justifying their stereotypical judgements of another group, not so often by people sharing their personal experiences.

vegan,3drl7f,UisceDhiaga,0,Sun Jul 19 12:32:15 2015 UTC,I didn't write that part of the response the way I should have to make the point that I wanted to. It came across in a way I didn't intend. I don't believe generalisation is okay and stereotypes exist because of the loudest people within a large group and those that are the loudest very rarely actually represent the whole accurately.  OP said that carnists want to remain ignorant to the facts of the meat and dairy industries. That is also a generalisation and shouldn't be made. Many carnists know the facts and aren't bothered by them and don't want to be told x number of times how wrong or unethical their choices are because a certain group of people has a different opinion. That doesn't make either group more wrong or right than the other.
vegan,3drl7f,HelpMe1313,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, I imagine that the type of vegan that does call meat-eaters carnists, and actively wants to educate them on the choices they make, might come off as preachy.

But I do ask you to challenge your beliefs that generalize a large population, based on limited, anecdotal experiences, and yes statistics are useful.

One being I haven't found the right balance of foods to keep my blood sugar from dropping too low without the extra protein from meat.  I didn't make the post to argue in favor of eating meat. I did so to point out the flaws in OP's arguments so OP could strengthen them.
vegan,3drl7f,negroyverde,-2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw a couple tough ones at you. It has been said that ""ideology consumes itself""; veganism is not any different. There are logical bounds that force all rigid idealogues to recognize that what looks so certain to them is, in another light, nebulous and ambiguous to the point of absurdity.   But hunters do not look for the ""easy kill"". They look for the ""trophy kill"". >They only want the buck with the largest antler spread.    I think this is an unfair characterization of what hunting can be. It's also colonialist, given that indigenous peoples often hunt in a manner that does make them, in effect, top-level predators. While your observations are accurate for plenty of American hunters, and I agree this way of doing things ought to be stopped, plenty of people hunt because they want a more honest means of feeding themselves. Monoculture kills more animals than any vegans talk about.. It would make more sense - and be more honest - to simply eat a deer once in a while than to allow more animals to die more distantly just because we're uncomfortable with flesh and have more invested in our puritan-influence identities than a consistent approach to our views.   All vegans want is to reduce suffering. Period. If you know of any other way to effectively reduce the suffering of animals that is MORE effective than boycotting the product and speaking out against exploitation, by all means lets hear it.   Ah, but your saying ""let's hear it"" is usually quite hollow. I believe this is tied into point E10. People feel that veganism is reminiscent of fundamentalist religious dogma because many vegans appear quite flaccid in their willingness to hear out a counterpoint. Their minds are already made up firmly and their thinking is woven into a trendy, feel-good identity that eventually becomes more important than reason. True discourse is evenly considered. Certainly, the ""counterpoints"" most often raised to veganism are weak and self-serving quite often. But this does not mean by default that all counters to vegan thought are this way. The points I raised above about hunting, many vegans will read like a puzzle more than a serious contention worthy of consideration.   Dogma is as much a crutch for dealing with a world of suffering and destruction as is denial. It begins in a well-intentioned manner but rapidly, in its perceived certainty, becomes an article of faith to cling to like a security blanket.   If my tone is harsh, it is because vegans are often such strong-hearted people with a penchant for honesty and massive potential to change things. You'll note that I am essentially vegan - I do eat roadkill and dumpstered dairy/eggs/nonvegan (nonmeat) food. I am considering getting my hunting license as well. But when veganism is failing to convince large demographics of people, and failing again at retaining people (there are many more ex-vegans and ex-vegetarians than current), scrutiny is required. We have to re-approach what we took as basic truths, and keep our western puritan tendencies and egos out of the way."
vegan,3drl7f,sillybluelg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"I have read your post and taken your points on board. I disagree that your monoculture farming argument is one that opposed veganism. Hunting is entirely unsuitable to sustain the Earth's population, and can't replace large scale farming of crops. Therefore your statement that hunters are saving a larger number of animals killed by growing crops is untrue. For the world to live on a subsistence, hunter-gatherer diet, we would have to decrease the population by orders of magnitude. As I want to minimise the amount of suffering my existence causes, veganism is the only way to do this.   Your choice to ingest non-vegan, free food has nothing to do with this argument. I personally find the idea quite gross, but in my opinion it doesn't mean you are making any less of a difference, except for maybe when omnis hear about your choices and take it to mean that some animal products are ok to eat, but this is a small thing really. I strongly urge you to not get a hunting license, as any animals you kill have as much a right to live their lives out fully with no humans interference as you or I do."

I think it requires a deeply anthropocentric view to assume that humanity has a right to maintain such a large population. Even if everyone were vegan, topsoils are being depleted at such a rate that no matter what, the human population will be forced into decline within the century. Ergo, it makes sense to assume human population decline both from a practical perspective and a biocentrist perspective.  I'd be interested to hear what you think about my comments on the fundamentalist, absolute-dogma nature of veganism. I scarcely get much of a discussion about this, and yet it seems to be one of the largest issues facing veganism as a movement."
vegan,3drl7f,Uneje,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see an ethical way around our population that is realistic unfortunately, so it is up to us an individuals to live as sustainably as possible.   I do know what you mean about the defensiveness that I certainly have when discussing these issues with non vegans, but I am more than happy to discuss caveats and problems with people who I perceive to be friendly and to understand the real issues. I have no interest in trying to make people 'take the red pill' anymore, those conversations are difficult and unpleasant most of the time. I've only been a vegan for a year, and I think with time I will be more practised and able to make something productive from these conversations and not act so defensively. I think you are being a bit unkind when you characterise all vegans this way - the majority of people who talk to will be new vegans and not used to dealing with this kind of conflict.   In my own experience, I am unable to no be fundamentalist about my own behaviour in regards to veganism. I chose to eat a non-vegan bakery product a month ago instead of throwing it away, and not only had stomach cramps (most likely psychosomatic), but also felt real guilt. For me the line has to be 100% commitment. I've found that simply toeing this line makes other people feel very uncomfortable with zero verbal comment from me, so maybe part of your feelings stem from that."
vegan,3drl7f,satosaison,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:19:31 2015 UTC,"What is your point with your comments on dogma? If someone is vegan and says they're vegan cause gary yourofsky says so and he's the vegan pope, that would be dogma, but who says that? This post is a wall of text explaining many different reasons to become vegan and addresses many counterarguments.  If veganism was dogmatic wouldnt this post be: veganism is correct and thats that, gary and peter singer says so. ? Besides, if veganism is dogmatic couldn't you argue carnism is dogmatic? Its indoctrinated from birth after all, most of us became vegan after evaluating our previous moral system.  I also think in order for something to be dogma it needs to be an opinion regarded as fact usually given by the leader (which neither veganism or carnism have).  Why are vegans considered dogmatic but the ASPCA isn't?  Its not that the ASPCA isnt pushy, or that they feel its ok for you to abuse dogs if thats whats best for you.  I guess the reason it's not considered dogma is because people generally agree that pet neglect and violence against dogs is wrong. Veganism is considered by some to be dogma because they disagree that chicken neglect or violence against chicken is wrong.  That's my take at least."

vegan,3dv13w,TopCaliber,3,Sun Jul 19 19:15:42 2015 UTC,"The great think about Tikka Masala is that you can vary it according to your tastes. It's hard to know what any given person is going to like, so it's hard to know what a ""good"" recipe is for you. Here's what I do:  Over a low flame melt:   3T Earth Balance   Add:   ~10 whole cloves 1 T Fenugreek seeds   Keep the heat low, you don't want the cloves or fenugreek to burn or cook. You are just trying to get the oil to leech out of them into the Earth Balance. Cook it for 5 minutes or so. Pull it off the heat and pull out the seeds and cloves. You can use a strainer to pour the Earth Balance through, or just sort of corner the seeds and pull them out with a spoon. Then add:   2 t ground cumin 1/2 t turmeric 1/4 t cardamom 1 t ground ginger clove of finely crushed garlic   Optional:   coriander paprika nutmeg red pepper black pepper   That's a serious spice load. All of the spices that I think of as mandatory (cumin, turmeric, cardomom, ginger, garlic) are optional. And the optional ones are optional too. It's easy to go crazy with any type of Indian cooking and throw the whole spice rack in.  Cook it for a few minutes, again, on low temperature, you don't want to burn the garlic and ginger (or maybe you do! As long as it isn't blackened, if slightly more cooked and crunchy garlic is something you like then, that's what you like). Then add:   A 14.5 oz can of Diced Tomatoes cilantro (optional, and more for garnish as an option) 1 T of soy milk powder some water   Now you bring up the heat. I keep a cup of water nearby and add a little if the whole thing is getting too thick. But you might like it thick or thin. Whatever you like is fine.  After cooking ten minutes or so, I pour it all into the blender and blend it. Then I put it back in the pot and add fake chicken and let the fake chicken absorb the sauce. It really drinks it up."

I don't recommend cashew milk as it did not end up quite as smooth as past attempts I made with almond milk, nor as solid as I would have liked no matter how much chocolate I added.

vegan,3dsrs1,satosaison,4,Sun Jul 19 03:02:29 2015 UTC,"Well, it was really dark when I had the egg thing. The chicken that I saw might have been the only piece in the dish. It was near the bottom of the dish, so I didn't notice it until I got to that point. I inspected the rice before I ate it. I guess I could've done a more thorough job, yet I was very hungry, so I wasn't thinking rationally. When you're hungry, you're an idiot."

You shouldn't really be feeling that hungry that you feel that you can't think straight and make rational decisions. Obviously it happens to all of us sometimes but with a bit of planning it should get better.   I'd just tell your parents pretty much what you said here, but without all the backstory obv since they were there for it. ""I don't really feel comfortable eating at non veg restaurants anymore but I really don't mind if you guys go out without me now and again"". It might help if you can say it in a situation where you guys are not actively deciding where to go next so it doesn't come off passive aggressive!"

For eating out with people with ""normal"" diets I usually recommend places I know I can eat at that have easily modified dishes. Taco Bell as an example or a lot of English speaking Mexican food places, always be skeptical of refried beans.  And for food stories, when I was in my third year of vegetarian I was at taco bell and told them I was allergic to meat and my body couldn't break break down the protein. Get my burrito, I was starving, took a huge bite into it and started chewing before I realized I tasted chicken and my body threw up the contents of my stomach on the way to the bathroom and was rewarded with free burritos and a gift card."

In my last 5 years of being vegan I've encountered plenty of assholes who think it's funny to see if I'll notice the meat they hide in my food when they know I'm just vegan and don't want the meat in my food vs being allergic and a possible law suit if I ate it. And to me being vegan is similar to being modified and being atheist, most people don't want to hear your personal onions on life shoved down their throats. I'd rather not be that person that potentially ruined the concept of veganism for someone than possibly ""punch my vegan card""."

I cook using the same things my parents use to cook their meat (after washing). I guess you're right - it is really just to reduce the suffering. If one piece of chicken (one that was intended to go in another) landed in my dish, it would not increase the number of animals killed. I'm still upset about the ordeal, but it's not about being ""pure"". I just felt bad for the chicken. But putting it in perspective, I was not directly or indirectly responsible for its death. I'm not upset with the restaurant, they made a careless error. I guess I'll just continue to go to non-veg places, and if I'm accidentally served something that isn't vegan, I'll just get over it."

Hopefully, the fact that I brought it to their attention, they'll be a little more careful with the vegetarian/vegan dishes."
vegan,3dsrs1,0bel1sk,3,Sun Jul 19 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"For some reason I have found that people are more understanding/better educated/empathetic with vegetarians, so I can just claim to be vegetarian and allergic to dairy and eggs and usually be pretty safe.  This is a great trick to use when altering vegetarian items, and still useful when altering carnivorous items as well.  Of course, I also scrutinize the menu and each item's ingredients before ordering to know exactly what to expect.  Also, I have become more and more comfortable asking questions. Previously I felt like I would always take too long to order by asking too many questions, but I realize I am only helping myself (which I deserve as a customer) as well as vegans who will eat after me, because I am helping the server/cashier learn about veganism. So, if you feel like you're skipping some questions for the sake of others, then stop skipping those questions. Ask them. You're doing more good than harm."

It disturbs us to be presented with the tangible evidence of an innocent animal's untimely death and disgusts us to be served their corpses or bodily functions as food. Everyone should care as much as we do. Unfortunately, apathy currently prevails.  Do whatever you must to not experience that sort of circumstance anymore. Let your family know and let them accordingly decide for themselves their own stance regarding their restaurant choices when with you.

You would likely know that his resentment at ""feeling bad"" about the situation is almost a denial that there exists a problem in the first place. Unless you think ""the Nazis shouldn't feel bad about what they did"", you understand why those feelings are a legitimate and practically necessary response to the situation.  If someone is sharing the truth with you, however passively or aggressively they do it, they are not the ones making you feel bad about it. They aren't putting emotions into you that you didn't have. If you consider yourself a rational person and feel ashamed about your actions, it is because you sense on some basic level that they were inappropriate, not because someone is manipulating you."

NASA just received new photos of Pluto that show us what the planet looks like better than we've ever seen it before. But have you been to Pluto? Has any other space agency taken photos of Pluto? No. So how do you know it isn't ""propaganda""?  Your desire to judge animal rights media as propaganda isn't coming from your rational senses. It's coming from the desire to justify the consumption and exploitation of animals, and to in part defend those who are skeptical or downright in denial when presented face-to-face with videos and images that show them exactly what happens in animal agriculture."

When he says ""humans are herbivores"", he's drawing that conclusion from the facts that we share more physiological traits with common herbivorous animals than we do omnivorous or carnivorous animals. And he thinks that's adequate evidence to say we're herbivores. That's not a lie, he's just wrong.  Just because we share more traits with herbivores doesn't mean that we aren't facultative omnivores. We know we can consume animal products, and in moderation it poses no great threat to our health. Even still, knowing that we can doesn't mean we should, nor does it mean that a diet comprised mainly of animal based foods is an optimal one."

vegan,3dsduu,cuberail,4,Sun Jul 19 01:33:18 2015 UTC,"I have cobbled it together from a few sites.  I can tell you what I do.  Ingredients: 1 carton shelf-stable silk organic (cheaper than the non organic for some reason) soy milk. Seriously. Soy. Otherwise it fails for me.  1/4 c tapioca flour  Maple syrup, lemon juice, and vanilla flavoring to taste.  One carton non dairy yogurt with live cultures  Steps:  Pour your carton of milk into a pot and bring to a boil.  Then slowly add your tapioca flour a little at a time. Stir it in as best you can and don't worry if it is sorta clumped and yucky. Keep it on the heat until it almost boils over.   Take it off the heat and dump into the blender while it is still hot. Blend it like crazy until it is super smooth. Add lemon juice (for tartness), your maple or agave (for the yogurt cultures to eat and for yum), and some vanilla.  Pour it into a bowl and let it cool to the temp of your body.  If you put your finger in, it should feel neither hot nor cold. Add your yogurt.  Put in the cold oven and cover with a towel.  If there is a chance the towel will drip down into it, put a strainer on top and then the towel. Turn the oven light on and leave the door closed for at least 12 hours.  Take the yogurt out and taste. If it needs to be more tart, leave it in for another hour or two.  Get a soup pot or big bowl and hang a mesh strainer on the top so it won't fall in. Put a tea towel inside it and pour your yogurt on the towel. The whey will drip out into the bowl. Put it in the fridge for around 8 hours.  Take it out and flip the contents out into another bowl so the yogurt goes in and then the towel on top. Save the whey that dripped out in a mason jar or something. You can use some of this as starter for future batches.  Now you have amazing yogurt. Enjoy it!"

vegan,3dqg3g,indorock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:34:39 2015 UTC,I mean there is a difference. A vegan can see they are both wrong but in different degrees. Animal exploitation and murder for pure pleasure is still more despicable than the (fallacious) argument that we need meat to survive.
vegan,3dqg3g,Vulpyne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:33:21 2015 UTC,"the (fallacious) argument that we need meat to survive.   I am quite skeptical that the reason the majority of people eat meat/animal products is because they genuinely believe it is necessary for survival.   If that was the case, I should be able to instantly create vegans by showing them the American Dietetic Association's position on veganism (appropriate for all life stages, nutritionally complete, may confer health benefits) or similar material. Never seen it happen, in spite of providing that sort of material very frequently."

So I'm still skeptical this is the reason for people eating animal products.   fit in with society/etc"" All bullshit arguments, granted, but tend to have a bit more weight to them than ""I shoot lions because it makes my dick hard"".   How so? Fitting into society or satisfying a flavor preference are things that make us happy. Shooting a lion may be something that makes someone happy, having a trophy may make someone happy. It seems like the difference between actions is how happy they make people, whether it's eating a steak or shooting a lion. So I don't see why they can't compared.  You might say that people who eat meat incidentally satisfy an actual need but I'm pretty sure people would not apply that argument consistently. For example, I live in an area that gets pretty cold in the winter, so I need warm clothing or I'll die of exposure when I'm outside. I could kill people, skin them, tan the skins and make  nice human leather coat — this coat would satisfy a necessity.   How far do you think I'd get using that line of argument to justify my actions when I could just as well get a coat made of synthetic material which satisfy that need?"

These times were my cheat times when I went through that back and forth and was the one thing that kept me from going full vegan. It was tough, but I learned to love salads and telling the waiter what I wouldn't eat. It can be frustrating, but I learned to deal with it.

I'm a student so often don't have the money to buy the items, but I have tried many of them once. I find people looking at the stuff and then I start telling them about stuff I like. I must be fairly convincing, because non-veg heads usually make purchases. Perhaps an idea for vegan outreach, just stand next to items in grocery store and push them! HA"

Lots of the textile jackets are made without leather - Dainese is a popular one. I have a Roland Sands jacket that is made from waxed canvas, I like it a lot, and it looks good enough to wear around town.   Helmets are a little trickier. Most have at least a few small pieces of leather. I have a HJC helmet that's 4-5 years old, but it doesn't have any leather on it that I could find. Took a few trips.   Gloves are really hard. Dainese used to make a pair of vegan gloves, but they stopped. They've said they ""might"" be coming back next year when I called and asked. Biltwell makes a pair of really lightweight gloves without leather. I have a pair that I wear sometimes, but they don't look like they're going to do anything in a crash. I normally wear a pear of Icon gloves that I bought used. They have a bit of leather on them. It bugs the shit out of me, but I've looked for over two years and never found any gloves without leather. In the end, I rationalize it with myself because I can't help many animals if I don't have hands.   Boots?

vegan,3dnh7q,newlyvegan,2,Sat Jul 18 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head: they could increase the tank size,  create more natural conditions,  allow mothers and children to stay together,  stop training them for tricks,  end their campaign of falsehoods about life span and health of captive whales.   Not much can be done?"
vegan,3dnh7q,janewashington,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:21:51 2015 UTC,"I was referencing as far as release. Increasing tank sizes is underway from my understanding, and I agree with you on most of those fronts, but I would be disappointed if they stopped training. Animal training is really important as far as physical and mental stimulation, for any species, not just whales."
vegan,3dnh7q,newlyvegan,2,Sat Jul 18 13:31:12 2015 UTC,"The tank increase is pretty minimal,  the changes are mostly designed to enhance guest experience.    Training animals to perform for human amusement can't be the only way to stimulate them mentally.    I think it's really bizarre to maintain they are doing all they can while they are still breeding animals and justifying continued exploitation.  Profit is their motive."

vegan,3dr773,furmat60,3,Sat Jul 18 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"It depends what you do with it, frozen tofu is superior to regular tofu for a variety of dishes.

It is inferior for scrambles and things like that."

vegan,3dr773,furmat60,3,Sun Jul 19 04:22:40 2015 UTC,I think tofu only lasts about a week or so when stored in water. I'm sure you could try vacuum sealing some of the blocks but I think it'd make more sense to prepare it and then freeze it. I've frozen several batches of bbq tofu in it's marinade (before cooking it) and it keeps pretty well. I just thawed it out a little before throwing it in the oven.

When I blend the onion, tomato, etc. in a food processor, I also like to add some sun dried tomatoes and cooked potato to make it richer and smoother. The spices I use differ every time depending on what I have but I usually use nooch, curry powder (garam masala is hard to find), red pepper flakes, and salt, plus whatever else I have on hand that I'd like to use. Lastly, I add chunks of halfway-cooked potatoes when I start to cook the onion/tomato gravy mixture, it fills out the dish and they're really good after cooking in the mixture for a while. Don't turn the heat on too high if you're using potatoes or they'll burn on the bottom and don't be afraid to let it cook for a while on low heat instead, I find the dish tastes better this way. If it starts to dry out, add some water and allow it to cook out.

I also get really excited for and enjoy more the food I buy from restaurants, etc.  I think it's a combination of a plant-based diet making you physically feel better, 0 moral compromises in what you're eating, and having your options ""limited"" but also enjoying all kinds of new foods you probably wouldn't have tried as an omni and therefore sort of being more appreciative of the food you do eat. I guess when your lifestyle choice is so revolved around food, it becomes more of a source of enjoyment.  Plus, tastes just change as you learn to eat more of the food and enjoy it more. And veggies are awesome. Made some asparagus with onions cooked in coconut oil and a bit of lemon juice the other day and it was amazing."

vegan,3dooa9,Organia,15,Sat Jul 18 01:59:59 2015 UTC,Well the earth is 4 billion so still wrong. And no. Everything dies. But not all stars go super nova. You need to be a good buit bigger than our sun to go super nova or hyper nova.  Here is a good size comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smmNP8G69vc  The sun will eventually exhaust its hydrogen in the core. It will then begin to fuse helium and expand greatly. Consuming the first 2 planets and possibly even earth. Even if it does not consume earth all life will die from the massive increase in radiation. Eventually it will expand to far to retain enough Helium fusion shed its outer layers. It will then shrink down to a few thousand miles in diameter and become a white dwarf!
vegan,3dooa9,ResoluteSir,-5,Sat Jul 18 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"Well the earth is 4 billion so still wrong.   You mean estimated to be 4 billion years old, or an educated guess at best. If the best the leading scientific minds can come up with is an estimate, then you aren't really in a position to throw around that number with any real authority any more than he is. Making his estimate of 6 billion reasonable and likely not far off.   The sun will eventually exhaust its hydrogen in the core.   Okay. But the sun will still die.   Consuming the first 2 planets and possibly even earth. Even if it does not consume earth all life will die from the massive increase in radiation.   So basically you have no problem with his assertion that everything on the planet will eventually be dead and gone, just the numbers and the word supernova? You agree with his points but the problem is semantics?"
vegan,3dooa9,kafoBoto,10,Sat Jul 18 04:59:10 2015 UTC,"You mean estimated to be 4 billion years old, or an educated guess at best.   It's 4.54 billion years +/- 0.05 billion years. Scientists have narrowed it down to the tenths place, but the uncertainty lies in the hundreths place. So the Earth is anywhere between 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old.   The 0.04 is the estimate. Basically, they're holding a meter stick up to something that goes beyond 4.5 but ends before 4.6. They don't quite know where it is in between those two numbers, but they know it's not outside their bounds. So they mark down what the hundredths place seems to be and add error bars. In the future, if they have better tools to measure dates, they'll learn what the hundredths place is and estimate the thousandths. And so on.  The age of the Earth is more than just an educated guess."

And yes everything on the earth will die. No shit. Nothing lives forever. The human race probably won't even make it the 5 billion years to the point when the sun expands.

Actually the age of the Earth is known relatively precisely to be around four and a half billion years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth  The margin of error is pretty narrow (relatively speaking of course)   So basically you have no problem with his assertion that everything on the planet will eventually be dead and gone, just the numbers and the word supernova?

vegan,3dmfbr,MagnaMike,6,Fri Jul 17 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like shit for having a hamburger this week after watching this video on that website. The ""why"" page on that website is extremely powerful. Over 2.5 million marine animals have been killed while I've been reading the page according to the counter on it. Wow..."
vegan,3dmfbr,squeek502,7,Fri Jul 17 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"Those numbers are actually outdated. World-wide, we're up to almost 70 billion land animals killed per year and between 1-3 trillion marine animals killed per year.  That's around 2,200 land animals killed  per second (1,900 of which are chickens) and at least 32,000 marine animals killed per second in the world.    Sources:   FAOSTAT [Region: World + (Total), Element: Producing Animals/Slaughtered, Items Aggregated: Meat, Total > (List), Year: 2013] Fishcount.org.uk: Fish count estimates"
vegan,3dmfbr,MagnaMike,7,Fri Jul 17 19:31:06 2015 UTC,The land animal number is already ~10x the human population and then the marine animal number is just crushing. I guess it's just a matter of time before I go vegan - I've already cut back on the amount of meat I eat over the past few weeks.
vegan,3dmfbr,booleanlogicgate,7,Fri Jul 17 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it will make you feel better to know that you are not at all alone in this. I remember when I first saw those numbers, it was staggering. I was devastated. At that time, I didn't even really know about by-catch; it was a term I'd heard before but it meant nothing to me. The more I learned, the more I realized it was unacceptable not to change. But, welcome to r/vegan! I think it's absolutely wonderful you're starting to question your diet and lifestyle, and I hope you find a welcoming community and the resources you need here that will allow you to live in line with your values. I've been vegan for about 7 months now, was vegetarian before that, and it's been a wonderful, if sometimes incredibly sad, journey."
vegan,3dmfbr,Omnibeneviolent,3,Fri Jul 17 22:20:24 2015 UTC,"Welcome! The majority of us on here were in your exact same situation at one point.   Everyone has different strategies, but I like to recommend easing into it by eliminating different groups of animal products in like 2-3 month increments. Here's how the order I went in:  Mammal meat. Bird meat. Fish meat. Eggs. Milk. Cheese. Misc (Gelatin, glycerine, etc.) All in all it was about an 18 month transition for me. As you cut different parts out, you will discover new foods to replace them. I found that I was eating a much wider variety of foods after I started the path to veganism than I ever did while I was a meat eater."
vegan,3dmfbr,shesallover,6,Fri Jul 17 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"I stopped eating fish before  gave up everything else.  I mean, I like whales and dolphins, so why would I want to steal their food? That kind of thing.   And I love fish.   Then everything else just followed suit. I am an environmentalist, oppose industrial expansion, so it didn't make sense to keep eating meat. Then dairy and eggs got cut off my grocery list.  I'm not a strict vegan by any stretch. I'll eat pizza with cheese on it, and I've eaten food that has animal byproducts for sure. I'm fine with honey, and I wear leather shoes. But I won't cook, serve, share, prepare, endorse, or encourage meat, dairy, or egg consumption. I just can't argue for it without feeling like a dunce."
vegan,3dmfbr,Paradoxlogos,6,Fri Jul 17 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"Well, my suggestion would be to try out some vegan meals. I think alot of people assume that eating what they aren't used to will be more difficult than it needs to be. Personally, I've developed a better taste for cooking since I've gone vegan and like the things I've discovered. When I eat out I feel limited, but when I make my own food I really find it quite good."

That’s 400 million individuals who were spared a lifetime of unimaginable suffering.   Does this mean in the US only? Because I thought the global demand for meat has been more or less exploding as of late. I'm pleased to see those numbers, but would love to also hear global demand is falling, too."

Sautee until onions are translucent. Throw in mushrooms until they are all soft and sauteed too. Add some baby spinach until it's all wilted and what not. Maybe some veggie beef crumbles if you're feeling nasty. Throw in a jar of spaghetti sauce. Season with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper. Put pasta in sauce conglomeration. There ya go.    Buffalo tempeh. Preheat over to 425 F. Steam or boil tempeh that has been cut horizontally and then vertically to give you 4 thinish rectangles for 8 minutes. Mix 1 tblsp melted earth balance with 1/2 cup Frank's Red Hot.  Throw your tempeh into the hot sauce and get it nice and coated. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Pour the rest of your buffalo sauce over the tempeh. Have on a sandwich (I like mine with vegan ranch, lettuce, tomato, and red onion).    Tortilla crust pizza. Preheat oven to 425 F. Take a tortilla crust and spread some tomato sauce on it. Top with vegan cheese and whatever toppings you like. I like to add garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper also. Bake for about 10 minutes.    Tacos. Sautee some veggie beef crumbles until thoroughly heated. Sometimes I add a can of green chiles cuz I'm crazy like that. Throw in a packet of taco seasoning (some do have milk for some reason so check the ingredients, I think most of the Old El Paso ones are vegan). Wa-la. Serve on tortillas with whatever taco toppings you like.    Baked potatoes and brussel sprouts. Bake a potato. Roast some brussel sprouts (I like mine with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.) Put whatever you like on said potato. Bam. Dinner is served.    Mushroom cheezsteak. Sautee some green pepper and onion. Add some mushrooms. Throw in a toasted hoagie and top with favorite vegan cheese.    Tofu scramble. There's a million recipes online but it's all pretty much the same formula: Press tofu, crumble tofu into pan, sautee tofu with veggies and spices. Done.    May also want to try some slow cooker recipes. They tend to be ""throw shit into pot, wait many hours."""

vegan,3dovi3,mmmveggiebacon,2,Sat Jul 18 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"Buy frozen chopped vegetables. That's just a case of sticking them in the microwave or a pan. Buy tinned or microwave pouch beans. Have that with your noodles and potatoes. Depending on what you're making it can be done in the same time.   You can make noodle soup really easily in one pan, do the frozen veg, then the beans and water and seasonings and add the noodles to cook in that. 5 minutes to cook and only 1 minute to wash up. Just because it's lazy to make doesn't mean the vegetables somehow don't count. You'll get back into the swing of things.

I got a pet goldfish two years ago (when I was vegetarian, not vegan) and he is super adorable. People love to claim goldfish are dumb and have 3 second memories, but he recognizes faces, he greets people who he likes and hides when strangers enter the house. He gets ridiculously excited when family members pass by his tank even though he gets fed by an automatic feeder and follows them across his tank. He is curious about fingers and hands that enter his space. He's honestly feels more doglike than fish. When I have time, I was even planning on teaching him tricks.  I think it all comes back down to desensitization, society tells us these animals are stupid, have limited perception of the world around them, and are incapable of suffering, but in actuality they are more complex than we realize."

I feel that being somewhat ethical (vegetarian not vegan) versus less ethical (meat but no veal, or meat only a few days a week, or free range or other marketing rather than all types) versus no regard for ethics (eat any meat) is an important step for society as a whole. Is everyone going to turn into a vegan tomorrow? No, but if we can get people to just be a little more aware, eat a little less meat, it all adds up. We are all hypocrites at some level, why not acknowledge it and not judge others for their level of hypocrisy if they're at least starting to think about the issues?"

I understand that for some people it might be overwhelming to go full vegan from the start, but as a long term thing it just doesn't make any sense at all. I do think some people are just not aware of how cruel the dairy and egg industry are, but as soon as you are informed of that and choose not to care, you are part of the problem."
vegan,3dlx7g,Aryada,4,Fri Jul 17 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"Being vegan is certainly more of a 'complete' solution to the ethical problems involved with meat/dairy and its industry, but to say that ethics are not a sufficient reason to be a vegetarian is just inacccurate. Would you not agree that it is just as big of an ethical advancement for a mest eater to go veggie as it would be for a veggie person to go full vegan? Veganism may be the more ethical choice of the two for sure, but it isn't fair to say someone who is a vegetarian cannot have ethical reasons behind it."

When soy is used as a food product, there do not appear to be large reductions in testosterone for the most part.[41] Supplementation with Soy Protein shares this same notion, and the trend suggests that does not seem to adversely affect testosterone.[42][43][44] It should also be noted that many studies on Whey Protein or Casein Protein protein supplements will use soy protein as a control; many of the studies cited on those pages which use soy protein as control can be used as indirect evidence for the inefficacy of soy protein supplements in lowering test.  Most well-conducted meta-analyses come to similar conclusions. The evidence is too weak or varied to come to the conclusion that 'soy reduces testosterone'.[45][46]  This isn't to say that soy is not at all related to lower testosterone levels; some case studies note that drastic overconsumption of soy can result in reduced androgen levels.[47] There is some evidence that for those who harbor the bacteria that can produce equol, that they can experience reductions in testosterone.[48] A study that did not specifically control for Equol but noted its production also noted decreases in testosterone.[49]  One study found decreases in testosterone independent of equol[50] but has been criticized for its statistical analysis for including a large outlier.[51] Another study noted decreases at high isoflavone contents, but minimal decreases at lower isoflavone contents (and did not control for equol production).[52]  Soy does not appear to significantly affect testosterone levels in moderation (1-2 servings of soy food daily, less than 25g of soy protein from non-concentrate sources), and seems to be able to adversely affect testosterone levels when superloaded (enough so that the equol issue is moot; around 100mg isoflavones daily). Between moderation and excess, there is a grey area that is dependent on whether or not one is able to produce equol from daidzein.

""In regards to men and Testosterone, the isoflavones Soy Isoflavones and daizein are implicating in reducing testosterone levels. When soy is used as a food product, there do not appear to be large reductions in testosterone for the most part.[41] Supplementation with Soy Protein shares this same notion, and the trend suggests that does not seem to adversely affect testosterone.[42][43][44] It should also be noted that many studies on Whey Protein or Casein Protein protein supplements will use soy protein as a control; many of the studies cited on those pages which use soy protein as control can be used as indirect evidence for the inefficacy of soy protein supplements in lowering test. Most well-conducted meta-analyses come to similar conclusions. The evidence is too weak or varied to come to the conclusion that 'soy reduces testosterone'.[45][46] This isn't to say that soy is not at all related to lower testosterone levels; some case studies note that drastic overconsumption of soy can result in reduced androgen levels.[47] There is some evidence that for those who harbor the bacteria that can produce equol, that they can experience reductions in testosterone.[48] A study that did not specifically control for Equol but noted its production also noted decreases in testosterone.[49] One study found decreases in testosterone independent of equol[50] but has been criticized for its statistical analysis for including a large outlier.[51] Another study noted decreases at high isoflavone contents, but minimal decreases at lower isoflavone contents (and did not control for equol production).[52] Soy does not appear to significantly affect testosterone levels in moderation (1-2 servings of soy food daily, less than 25g of soy protein from non-concentrate sources), and seems to be able to adversely affect testosterone levels when superloaded (enough so that the equol issue is moot; around 100mg isoflavones daily). Between moderation and excess, there is a grey area that is dependent on whether or not one is able to produce equol from daidzein. These numbers do not apply to soy protein concentrate, which has negligible isoflavone content from ethanol extraction. 41 Maskarinec G, et al Serum prostate-specific antigen but not testosterone levels decrease in a randomized soy intervention among men .

It seems fear-mongering to me (with the whole ""it might"" but then links to an article saying with proper consumption no harm will be done), but they have some points made (the article makes some points).  in the article linked by /u/GeoM56    Most well-conducted meta-analyses come to similar conclusions.

So it's more important for those with european ancestry to eat a healthy amount of soy daily (preferably not the soy protein concentrate) and to not over do it.  The article boasts 1-2 servings is healthy, meanwhile dr michael greger has made a very informative video on how many soy servings is healthy a day where he suggests no more than 5 servings of soy a day.  Conclusion is soy is healthy if eaten in the right amounts, same as any other food out there."
vegan,3dm6fy,GeoM56,13,Fri Jul 17 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"His post is bullshit because:   He didn't even take the time to properly format it. Literally just copied and pasted a wall of text.

These are not exaggerations.  This is not fear mongering.  This is an attempt to counter the claim that ""soy does not affect testosterone.""  The evidence suggests that that claim is false.    If you are going to say that there are many caveats to the claim that it might, then I would agree.  I even posted the caveats and the sources.  With that said, the claim that soy doesn't affect testosterone has just as many caveats and is bullshit, in essence, because of the caveats."
vegan,3dm6fy,deeepseadiver,8,Fri Jul 17 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"When there's that many caveats it's a nonsensical statement, though. It's like saying vegans could become protein deficient; we might, but you'd pretty much have to actually work for it. Just because something is not literally impossible doesn't mean it's plausible, and the way you framed your comment heavily implies a normal diet including soy could mean decreased testosterone production. Which it could not."
vegan,3dm6fy,GeoM56,-3,Fri Jul 17 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"My apologies for the formatting.  But, you can't use that to call my post bullshit.    Also, soy can affect testosterone if consumed at high volumes, or if consumed by those with the gut flora that produces equol.  My claim ""it might"" is true, while the claim that it doesn't affect testosterone is false.  How is my claim bullshit, and the false claim not?  How are you not seeing how blinded you are by your need to be correct?"

vegan,3dm6fy,GeoM56,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:23 2015 UTC,"no one consumes soy in the quantities that would cause that effect.   Where did you get this information?????  That is an uninformed statement.    ""Soy does not appear to significantly affect testosterone levels in moderation (1-2 servings of soy food daily, less than 25g of soy protein from non-concentrate sources).""  Are you claiming people do not eat more than 25g soy protein from non-concentrated sources?  That's less than half a cup of soy beans.  If an individual who has equol producing gut flora is eating a normal amount of soy beans (for example), there is absolutely a risk of impacting testosterone production.   What say you?"
vegan,3dm6fy,GeoM56,7,Fri Jul 17 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"Your point is still nonsensical.   This only shows that they tested and saw no effects up to moderate consumption.   They only saw effects at extremely high doses:   seems to be able to adversely affect testosterone levels when superloaded (enough so that the equol issue is moot; around 100mg isoflavones daily)   So my point still stands.

vegan,3dm6fy,stephtveg,-4,Fri Jul 17 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"My friend... you agree that eating 100mg of isoflavones a day can affect testosterone production. You have concluded that consuming 100mg isoflavones could not be part of a normal diet, so this effect of isoflavones on testosterone production is not a concern.    I sincerely hope you take a second to reconsider your stance.    One would only have to eat less than 3 ounces of dry roasted soy beans to consume 100mg of isoflavones.  1 cup of boiled soy beans has 94mg of isoflavones.  (Sources below).  So, even if an individual is not particularly sensitive to soy isoflavones (has the gut flora that produces equol), it is entirely possible to be ""superloading"" isoflavones to the point of affecting testosterone production while consuming a normal diet.    http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=6382  (PDF ALERT!!!)  http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones#food-sources"

Then you can be vegan and not eat soy or eat very small amounts. There's are vegans who live that way, no problem.  Secondly, eating a diet healthy in saturated fats and foods containing cholesterol (yes there are vegan food sources containing both these things, mostly fats) can prompt testosterone levels to raise. So even if a person is having some amount of soy in a diet, as long as they get proper nutrition it's shouldn't be a cause for concern."

They'll also insist on weird superstitious/emotional requirements sometimes like that the donor be an alumni of the university they both went to or be involved in the same sports that they are.   Other parents don't intend to inform their child that they were from a donor egg, so they'll want to select a blood type that would be possible from their own genetic combination (i.e. if mom and dad are both negative they don't want a positive donor and risk their kid putting two and two together down the line)."

You have to find a balance between living your life/righteous lifestyle without removing yourself from others. 3) Your mom says you're picky and nobody likes it, not saying you are but unfortunately you have to be very tactful in combating ignorance.  the nature of people is to be very defensive and close minded.  To have an ideology that rocks the whole foundation of there world is going to be something that shouldn't be strongly expressed to them directly is going to fail (don't fight fire with fire).  I''ve learned to be very tactful, sly and understanding in representing veganism.  For example I am extremely muscular 21 year-old male (trying not to sound cocky), I decided to get ""jacked"" to look good obviously but also to promote that you can easily build muscle on a vegan diet. But I don't shove veganism in people's faces because I know that won't work, I create bonds with people and then after months they may learn I am vegan and literally jaws drop (that's when you can tell someone's beliefs are being crumbled).  Hence if you're really serious about your vegan ideals you might have yo suffer for them, that's just a fact.  This is what I would do, and realize I don't want you to ruin your birthday, but I would go to the steakhouse with them, order no food (eat nothing, even if have vegan options) and keep as silent as possible the whole dinner.

First time talking about this. I loved animals back then too, but it never crossed my mind. I guess I assumed it couldn't feel anything. Now I love snails so much and like to let them crawl on my hand for a bit. Now every time I pick up a snail, I look into it's eyes and just think about how sorry I am.  Felt like sharing.

vegan,3dkdo6,ssinatra,6,Fri Jul 17 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"I remember when we went on a family vacation to Denver and the Rocky mountains. I think I was like 9 years old. When we were up in the mountains at the park, there was a group of baby ducks swimming in the stream. I didn't really have any concept of animal abuse or anything at the time... I was lobbing rocks in their direction... really just trying to splash them.   One rock was slightly larger and it came down right on the back of one of the ducklings. When the duckling came back up, I could tell that I had broken it's back. Suddenly, the reality of what I had done sank in and I was horrified. I immediately went back over by the picnic table where my family was sitting and sat down in silence and started to cry. I never told my parents about what I had done and it gave me nightmares for some time.   Just typing this out, I'm getting teary-eyed thinking about it. As much as I can remember, that was my only personal experience with animal cruelty and it was horrible. I didn't become vegan at that time... as with most people, I didn't connect food production with animal suffering. But man, that vision has stuck with me for some 20+ years.   I think maybe if more people could see the direct results of their action, they might care. Then again... they probably won't. I don't understand how some(most?) people's brains work.   Here's to that poor little duckling"
vegan,3dkdo6,jkamp,5,Fri Jul 17 12:02:03 2015 UTC,"Just to add to some of the great comments here, I think it's important to stress that most of the meat-eaters I've talked to are all for reducing harm caused to farm animals (up until removing the actual source of harm, which is having the demand at all). Meaning, a lot of them aren't cruel - they've rationalized in their minds that they need to eat animal products, or their views are such that their pleasure supersedes animal suffering. Many of them would say that the abuse that occurs in factory farms and slaughterhouses (treating animals like automatons as a coping mechanism, hurting them for fun and when not necessary) is wrong. They would advocate for a happy life and as painless a death as possible. They're just not willing or not aware enough to use their dollars to make this happen. It's all easy in the abstract - give them space! Let them graze! Wait until they're old to kill them! In practice, not so much."

Her sister (my other cousin) made the remark about how that was so mean and cruel... And I was just in shock... It was jaw dropping to me. I said but killing them is ok??? My mother was serving steak that night and I was just in awe of the disconnect. Needless to say she didn't really say much else the rest of the night because I kind of put her on the spot.  But I think the more we make people aware where their food comes from the easier it might be to make them realize how unethical  it is. For instance.. Instead of saying, how does that steak taste?

Outside of my dormitory at a college in Indiana, there were two guys throwing rocks at rabbits. I was coming up to the door of the dorm and saw them doing that, and asked if they were just trying to throw the rocks near the rabbits to make them run away, or if they were trying to hit them. They said either one. I was shocked, and asked one of them why it didn't matter to him whether the rocks hit them and hurt/killed them or not. He was really religious and said that it didn't matter if they hurt them because they didn't have souls. The sad thing is, I knew that guy somewhat and knew that in other ways he was a really nice guy, but he'd been brainwashed by the variation of Christianity he believed in."

I know you know this, but people are conditioned to believe that we should eat animals with every meal. They're condition to believe that everything that enters their mouth should be juicy and sweet. This conditioning can be challenged with education.   Before you can teach anyone else anything, you need to make sure that you have educated yourself FULLY on your lifestyle. Once you have, then you can start approaching the problems, the bigger reasons why as to why omnivores are harmful in their complacency.  A lot of people think they have educated themselves but know nothing of macros, nothing of the industrial complex, nothing of the effects it has or how difficult it truly is to eliminate animal products from all aspects of their lives. That is an education in it of itself that forces a person to reconsider their entire life system.

Usually three and just buy the ingredients I need for those. I don't really like having a million options in my apartment. I think buying exactly what I need and having a plan makes it easy.

I used to just splash oil in a pan when cooking, well, guess what, you just added 500 calories, take a tablespoon and measure it.

When I tried the next time, the same thing happened but that time I realized that I couldn't simply take meat off the plate and replace it with bread and expect to be healthy. So I started replacing it with more and more veggies.   You need to find out what veggies you like, how you like them and SAUCES! 10 years later, I am a happy, healthy vegan and dabble in raw vegan. There is no such thing as overeating veggies so load up!   Salads seem like a lot of work until you find one or two ""got-to"" version that you can whip up in a snap (I make the same salad everyday for lunch).   If you are trying to lose belly fat, try and stick to carbs only in morning since breakfast kick-starts your metabolism. Smoothies are a great thing in the morning because the fill you up for a long time. Oatmeal or overnight oats too. Eat a well-balanced, veggie-rich lunch. Don't fear snacks! Just keep them healthy- my favourite snack is apples with peanut butter or carrots with hummus. Keep granola bars with you for when you get that urge to snack and vegan food is hard to come by so you don't end up buying fries, etc..  For dinner I tend to eat only protein and veggies. Last night I grilled up a couple gardein chicken breasts and steamed a big bunch of kale.   Treat yourself to desserts! Vegan ice cream is my guilty pleasure. No one like a vegan that can only talk about how much they love salad (no one loves salad that much).   Bottom line is, you need to find foods you like that are rich in vitamins and protein. If you aren't happy with your diet, you'll hit that 6 month wall.  Best of luck to you!!"
vegan,3dmkqi,britpresh,2,Fri Jul 17 20:14:35 2015 UTC,"You could start by making healthier versions of your favourites. For example, you could buy some potatoes and make oil and salt-free oven-baked fries/wedges! You can season them with things like curry powder, paprika and herbs. I'm a high-carb vegan, so I love eating potatoes every day, haha. You can make them pretty fluffy with just an oven, you'd be surprised. Mine  (pigged out that day ;D)  I live somewhere where there aren't many vegan products like vegan cheese and stuff, so I've been pretty lucky not to cave into things like that. Do you like ice cream? Don't reach for that sugar-laden soy ice cream, make chocolate peanut butter nice cream using frozen bananas, peanut butter, dates and cacao!   Once you start cooking from scratch, the cravings will wear off."

vegan,3dmkqi,jillsgoodbye,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"Hey! I transitioned into it about a month and a half ago, and so far it's been amazing for me. As a ""regular"" vegan, I was experiencing migraines, digestive issues, and heartburn, and began looking into more specific vegan lifestyles like RT4 and HCLF since I knew my diet was off and wanted to listen to my body.  Since then, I no longer have heartburn and my digestive problems have gotten much better (I still get really bad cramps when stressed, though), and migraines are much less frequent. Basically, going HCLF naturally also led to cooking from scratch more and eliminating processed foods like bread, which I used to crave a lot but not anymore!  I definitely feel fuller for longer and more satisfied, my mood is strangely better, my groceries are cheaper, and as an added surprise - I'm down one belt buckle hole haha. I can't say that I feel more energised, though, since I'm lethargic from B12 deficiency. Overall, it's the best decision I've made, and I'd recommend anyone try it out for themselves. Hope that helps :)"
vegan,3dmkqi,-Sah-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:48:56 2015 UTC,"I would suggest slowly reducing the amount of processed foods in your diet. There are a lot of foods that are technically vegan, but are really unhealthy. Make sure that you are eating at least some foods that are low GI.  The Happy Pear run a youtube channel which has a lot of vegan recipes which aren't too difficult to cook. If you are looking for some ideas on what to cook and what ingredients pair well with each other.  You probably should also need to introduce seeds and nuts into your diet. Best of luck!"

vegan,3dmkqi,misskinky,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"The only things I put in a fridge are greens, berries and ground flax seed. The rest like fruit is put in brown paper bags to ripen. Quinoa, rice, beans, etc. are just in cupboards. I don't eat any wheat like bread by the way.  I literally buy like 24 nectarines from the store and eat only the ones that are ripe. That's nectarines for like 4 meals over around 4 days. And when I buy a bunch of bananas, they usually won't ripen for like 4-5 days, so I can get almost a week of food and eat ripe fruit from breakfast and lunch. The trick is to get things that ripen fast and things that ripen slow. Then I have grains/nuts/seeds/beans for dinner that last months.  I don't eat much vegetables :P  Just go buy like 4 days of food. If you make a mistake it's no big deal. You'll learn from experience.  Also, make sure you're getting omega 3 fats somehow. Seeds and nuts like hemp, walnut, flax and chia. Sometimes I make quinoa with all 4, it's amazing. You have to grind flax and soak chia fyi.  Get used to making beans from scratch. You boil them for like 2 minutes, and let them soak for an hour. Then rinse them and replace with new water. Then cook for like an hour and a half or until they taste soft and not grainy. Bam, wicked cheap no-brainer beans to add to any meal."

If you found a job that pays well, you think you'll like, and has flexible hours for a student, I think it would be impractical to turn it down just because you may come in contact with some animal products.

I hate it, but it's that or drop out of school for me at the moment. The way I look at it, since I'm still not consuming it it really doesn't make any practical, negative difference that I happen to be the person making it. And I've found that even in a not ideal job like that, there are still opportunities to live consistently in a vegan lifestyle. For example, I take particular care to not waste meat which I've seen most other grill cooks do not. If anyone has worked in the food industry, you know that tons of food goes to waste and in my experience, a fair deal of it is due to carelessness. And funnily enough, in my time there I've seen one other grill cook, who to be fair was already vegetarian, become a vegan which I like to think may have been influenced by our conversations. I've also seen coworkers become vegetarian and others express interest in learning about veganism. Anyway, all that to say that I feel that my job, more or less a vegan nightmare, doesn't really violate my principles; only my preferences. I've found many opportunities to bring some good to it, even if it is mostly relative, and I suspect that if they can be found even in the fast food industry then you'll have little trouble in the healthcare industry."

Make sure you are eating enough calories and I believe it is best if the majority of those calories are from carbohydrates to keep you fueled throughout the day. Protein, as you might be aware, is important, however is typically overemphasised. You will get enough protein without even trying, only if you are getting in enough calories. If you are interested, I eat 6 meals a day, typically 4 of which are pasta or rice based. I think I get around 3,500 calories with about 20g of protein in each meal, maybe more depending on what is in it. Best advice I can give you is eat oatmeal EVERYDAY.

I wasn't sure what gender you were (men usually are larger, need more calories) so I checked your comment history and see you recently posted your current stats. According to the Mayo Clinic calorie needs calculator, an active person with your stats would need about 2,050 calories per day. It doesn't support ages below 18, but I would guess that being slightly younger would actually increase your calorie needs due to your body still growing.  If you can, talk to someone actually knowledgeable on the subject to get an objective idea of your caloric needs and ideal weight. At your age it's likely hard to be objective about that sort of thing. Then you just need to have a rough idea of how many calories you're eating and check your weight every once in a while. If it's getting above the ideal, you can cut down a little. If you're a bit below the ideal, you can eat a bit more or add high calorie foods like peanut butter, oil, pasta, rice, etc until you're back where you should be.  You're doing a good thing here! Just make sure you do it in a healthy way. I've noticed that a lot of people making the transition to veganism make the mistake of eating less than they need to."

Especially for chickens:   The U.S. has no federal laws protecting farm animals while they’re actually on the farms where they are raised. Two federal laws cover farm animals during transport and slaughter, but tragically, all poultry species are excluded, making these protections inapplicable to 95% of land animals killed for food.  The majority of U.S. states expressly exempt farm animals, or certain farming practices, from their anti-cruelty provisions, making it nearly impossible to provide even meager protections. Exemptions usually include common agricultural practices that, while common, are often shockingly cruel.   The ASPCA has the legal authority to protect animals from crimes.  Nothing we do to chickens is a crime."

vegan,3dkos7,Agricola86,2,Fri Jul 17 03:05:21 2015 UTC,"Drain the tofu and let it sit for a bit. You can press it between two plates (like Agricola86 mentioned) or let it sit out for a while.  In this instance, I poured out the liquid, set it on the cutting board, then let it sit while I poured my frozen veggies in the water. Once the frozen veggies began to boil (about 10 minutes with a high performance induction surface, an entire 32oz bag), I would tilt the cutting surface to let what liquid has drained go into the sink. I then cut the Tofu length wise. It was still soft, but do it carefully and toss it on the pan. Searing it quickly is a good way to keep it together so you can flip it regularly."
vegan,3dkos7,hooks-and-whiskers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:27:55 2015 UTC,Are you pressing the tofu thoroughly first?   Get extra firm and put between two plates and then put something heavy on the top plate. Leave it there ten minutes or so and you'll get a much denser tofu once some extra moisture is pressed out.   Can also then freeze briefly then thaw out and press again which makes it even more dense.
vegan,3dkos7,deeepseadiver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"If you try freezing the tofu and then thaw it and press it, the tofu will take on a different texture.  It becomes spongy instead of gelatinous."

With Tofu, the inside rarely cooks, so what I do is try to heat it through and sear the outside to give it a quick crisp.  Normally, I would use sesame oil for high heat, but I only cook this one on slightly above medium.  When I do cubed tofu, I'll use Earth Balance soy butter on high heat, which does great!"

Since you indicated that you place it in hot olive oil and let it sizzle (which is indicative of high heat cooking since a saute doesn't really sizzle). Just thought people reading and lurking should know as olive oil does tend to ""pop"" a lot more than other oils on high heat."

Like they evolved eating meat. Isn't this kind of the opposite idea as non-vegans comparing themselves to Carnivores to justify eating meat? These animals are designed to eat meat and people want to feed them as little as possible because it isn't vegan?
vegan,3dktxn,Steve_the_haxorous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:40:02 2015 UTC,"Well... As someone who's a staunch vegan and whose long-time feline family member recently passed away, I believe I can speak to this.  I hated buying animal-flesh food for Winter (my cat's name). Every time I did so, I was making the explicit decision that another animal has to die -- probably in horrible ways -- because the animal in my care needs the nutrients from his or her body.  That said, I really do empathize with your sentiment here, Steve_the_haxorous; Winter came in to my life over a decade ago, and this was just shortly before I'd came to the realization that I could no longer ethically justify my own needless killing of sentient beings. However, she was a cat before I was a vegan. Unlike humans or dog, cats are obligate carnivores, which means they literally sicken if they don't consume the flesh of others (due to their need for L-lysine in particular, as I understand it).  As a vegan, this was an ethical problem for me, and it's one that grew in importance for me over time. But while I and my family made (and make) no use of animals for our meals or materials (in every way that it's possible for us), we cannot reasonably force that ethic on the cat. Her ethical context is different from ours in many ways, but not the least of which is that humans thrive brilliantly without consuming bodies, but cats do not; it's a choice for us, but a necessity for her. If there was another way, I would take it. As such, for so long as she is was in my care, she continued to receive the nutrients she needed -- no matter how uncomfortable the act of purchasing it was for me. For my part, it helped to think of this as being analogous to having an elderly parent or special-needs person in ones care who demands ""meat"" without regard to ethics, so you purchase those products for them (out of a sense of duty) but not for yourself (out of an acknowledgement of ethics).  Fair enough?"
vegan,3dktxn,Steve_the_haxorous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:05:47 2015 UTC,This seems to be agreeing with my sentiment not rebutting it. I am saying these animals need meat to survive so why are people trying to give them as close to a vegan diet as possible. Why should you feel morally challenged feeding your animal meat when it needs it? I can understand if it was because there is something wrong with the industry that makes the food. But just because you are a vegan isn't a reason to not want your pet to eat meat as well
vegan,3dktxn,Steve_the_haxorous,2,Fri Jul 17 14:29:45 2015 UTC,"Ah - sorry - I probably didn't highlight that bit strongly enough.  The conflict comes from participating in the death of other sentient individuals (i.e. by purchasing meat products). Each time that purchase is made, there's an explicit judgement being passed by the vegan that their pet is more important or more valuable than the anonymous animal that was killed and converted in to cat food. This issue is that ""meat"" is a euphemism for the body parts of a unique, thinking, feeling individual, and purchasing it (for whatever reason) is endorsing the killing of that singular entity.  It's not that vegans don't want animals in their care to get the nutrients they need; it's that procuring those nutrients carries with it some unambiguous ethical issues.  Makes sense?"
vegan,3dktxn,veganlove,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"Oh ok. I understand now. I am also at work so my reading was fairly quick. I get the express decision between your animal and another however, I see it as somewhat in a moot point in my mind. If you animal lived in the wild they would kill just the same.   I think my biggest issue would be more so supporting a corrupt industry rather than the actual death of the animal. The suffering the industry causes in unnecessary but the death for your animal to survive is."
vegan,3dktxn,mooninitetwo,2,Fri Jul 17 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"I have a senior cat who I adopted and feed a meat based diet too. He is very picky, and although I would love to not buy him meat based food and switch him to a vegan diet, I do not believe cats can safely be vegan either. Yes, there is great vegan cat food around, but seriously? These animals are made to utilize meat! They are not omnivores. I always ponder why other vegans would force their dietary views on an animal that was clearly made to consume flesh (look at cats teeth!) as well. I think this is because most all vegans are so against the death and exploitation of animals that they cannot bring themselves to buy into the industry, no matter what the meat based food is for. I totally understand this and feel the same way, but it is difficult. As a vegan, I eat the way I believe nature intended me to eat. I fed my cat what nature intended for him. It sucks and I feel awful, but companion animals are life long responsibilities and I am not going to put him up for adoption because of this issue. I also live in a very busy area and I cannot let my cat outside for long periods of time to hunt and fend for himself. Cats are obligatory carnivores, unlike humans and a lot of other animals (dogs, horses, cows, rabbits, rat, mice, birds, etc) For this reason as well, I am not sure if I will adopt a cat again but rather adopt an animal whose diet better suites MY lifestyle. If people want to buy vegan food for their animal, I always suggest to adopt an animal that can survive and fully function and do well on a vegan diet."
vegan,3dktxn,veganlove,3,Fri Jul 17 16:30:46 2015 UTC,"great vegan cat food   A lot of the vegan cat foods, like Ami Cat, have ingredients as their backbone that cats shouldn't consume at all. Vegan cat foods also tend to be VERY high carbohydrate.   edit: I wouldn't argue that feeding cats vegan food is more ethical - that is true regardless of what happens to the cat.

vegan,3dji7p,tomit12,2,Fri Jul 17 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"When doing bio medical research scientists choose the ""lowest"" organism possible. If they were studying basic mechanisms of embryonic development or cell division they would use c elegans, a tiny 1 mm worm. If they were studying the brain or the immune system they would use a mouse, the smallest mammal. I don't have experience in this type of work but larger animals like beagles and pigs are used in physiology and toxicity experiments that can't be done in a small mammal like a mouse.   Sucks that it's like this but currently there's no substitute for animal models. We are still a long way from replacing animal models but no one actually likes using them. It's inhumane, expensive, takes forever, and highly variable. One day it will be replaced, we just don't have the tech yet."

vegan,3dlsfe,jogam,3,Fri Jul 17 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"There is a continuum, for sure. To use an extreme, eating the meat of an animal that died of natural causes causes less suffering than using dairy from a factory farm cow pumped full of hormones and that sees her calf taken away from her. And factory farmed pigs experience more suffering than a free-range dairy cow on a bucolic family farm that is milked by hand by humans who--though perhaps misguided--appear to love and care for her.  I believe that killing is worse than dairy/egg labor, in that it ends an animal's one and only chance to perceive and experience the world in which we live; it's permanent. The killing is also often quite painful. But, if you're to speak of quantity of suffering, a dairy cow that is overworked and kept alive for several years may experience more total suffering than a veal calf who is killed for meat but only lives a few months.  There is no shortage of fast food restaurants that cater to meat-eaters. There is no need for Amy's to offer meat options."
vegan,3dlsfe,andjok,6,Fri Jul 17 09:29:28 2015 UTC,"Considering that killing both the dairy producing cows and their calves is a part of that industry, I'd say dairy is probably worse than raising cows for their flesh."
vegan,3dlsfe,andjok,3,Fri Jul 17 19:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to say. As far as number of animals killed to get the same nutrition, some sort of fish are going to be at the top, because they are generally small and because of bycatch. They probably routinely suffer the worst deaths too, because they are not stunned but experience rapid pressure change, being crushed by other fish, and/or slowly suffocate to death. As for what ""food"" animal has the worst life, it's really hard to say as they are all made to be miserable, but I'd wager that it's either birds or cows used for dairy."

If you want to have them accommodate, since they don't seem to be quickly learning how, you'll have to communicate with them or at least the person who orders the food and ask if that would be possible, otherwise you can provide for yourself."

If so, then you might want to consider talking to Human Resources about this. It isn't necessarily the polite way to go about this, but it might do a better job at getting their attention. Especially if you can site moral and theological reasons for your diet."
vegan,3djkg0,SunshineAndGoldfish,6,Thu Jul 16 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"It'd be better to talk to the person ordering the food first, IMHO.  Immediately escalating to HR sends a really nasty message.  If the person ordering the food refuses multiple times and is absolutely resistant to ordering something acceptable, then maybe is the time to escalate... but you should always try and solve these problems as locally as possible first.  That's my 0.02 anyway."

In fact, the last time you found chicken in your salad you threw up a little and had to excuse yourself.  Making them feel sorry for you can work but it's not foolproof as you'll have to perform better than all of them to make sure there isn't any confusion about your dominance.  Other than trying to change the way they see things (which is a personal journey and not my place imo) I don't have any ideas.  Make sure to tell them how much you appreciate their offering though."

I don't think you're being picky at all; he should understand that you don't want to support an industry you don't agree with. In the end it's all up to you and how you feel about it."

The difference between my buying it and my making her make a second trip to buy it are:    She's annoyed. Wasted time and resources.    It makes no difference in her consumption. It makes no difference to any animals. Exxon-Mobil is a little happier, and we're both a little more annoyed. It's just wasteful and what I believe to be inappropriate in a relationship.

There is a difference in consumption, though, because he's a procrastinating shopper and it would've taken time for him to buy it. So it's possible that he waited a few days (especially with more [vegan] food in the house). Meaning, he could've eaten 1 package of cottage cheese for the week instead of 2. That reduces dairy consumption.   Plus, our relationship is stable enough where it didn't cause any strain (like I stated in the original post)."

If he wants something non-vegan (rarely happens), he knows I wont buy it for him like 90% of the time so he'll come shopping with me to get his pizza or whatever. I don't think it's rude to say no to buying non vegan food though. Maybe just say ""ok I'll look for the veg option if that.""

Well, one afternoon we crept into her room to see if we could figure  out what the problem was. Lo and behold, her wastepaper basket was literally overflowing with McDonald's wrappers.

This is just dumb, a position no rational person would hold. To be consistent, your food would have to come from supermarkets that were vegan, hired only vegan workers, were owned only by vegans, and bought their produce from farmers who were vegan.   Also, as a vegan, the smell of dairy obviously disgusts me   You're making it seem like all vegans are insufferable asshats with that statement.   so if he ever ate any cheese or anything I would insist on spraying him down with a full can on Febreeze afterwards.

Spice mix: (Edit: For ""teaspoons"", make them as heaped as you can get. It's more like two regular teaspoons for every one of mine.) 2 teaspoons hot chili powder  1 teaspoon chili flakes  1 teaspoon paprika  1 teaspoon coriander  1 teaspoon cumin  2 chopped up (mild) chili peppers  4 cloves garlic, diced or crushed  Vegetables (cut into similarly sized chunks):  1 large red onion  1 large white onion  2 (not chilli, regular) peppers  2 decent sized courgettes (Edit: Americans call these zucchini)  A whole bunch of button mushrooms  Canned stuff / misc:  3 cans chopped tomatoes  1 can red kidney beans  Can of green lentils / soy mince / chickpeas (all optional and depending on what I have in the cupboard / freezer, you don't need all of these)  In your biggest pan fry the onion til it browns, then add the courgettes and peppers.  Now throw in the spice mix. Mmmmmmm. Stir that right through. (If you've got it right, it should make it just a little bit harder to breathe for the next couple of minutes.)  Add the mushrooms, beans / whatever miscellaneous ingredients you chose. I keep stirring everything all the time, til it's softened just a little bit. After a few minutes, add the cans of chopped tomatoes, then leave it to simmer for at least 45 minutes.  Then leave it to cool for at least half an hour. (Ideally, overnight in your fridge. It always tastes better the next day.)  Cook the rice of your choice and heat up the chili again so it's all ready at the same time.  Optional: stir in some hummus after you've served it up. It makes it nice and creamy, and takes the edge off the heat (if you're into that sort of thing).

It took very little effort on their part."

It might also go over well if OP volunteered to cook dinner for the whole family occasionally and they could cook and add whatever meat or cheese they want.    I could see tacos being a really good option where everyone could assemble their own. I'd go for marinated mushrooms, beans, radishes, salsa, and guacamole. It could result in others in the house eating fewer animal products. If you're feeling ambitious, there are a lot of vegan recipes for baked oatmeal breakfast bars that would probably be a hit too."

There is a such thing as vegetable lard. Ever heard of Crisco or shortening? It's lard. But it's made from plants.  I would advise you to contact them again and rather than asking if they use lard, ask them ""do you use shortening or Crisco in your beans?"". That might put the nail in the coffin and avoid any sort of confusion in terms of their beans containing lard."

vegan,3dkcm6,satosaison,8,Fri Jul 17 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"I still don't care.  Edit- I really like this from the Vegan Society.  Is refined sugar vegan?  It depends on how you define “vegan.” Refined sugars do not contain any animal products, and so by an ingredients-based definition of vegan, refined sugar is vegan. However, some refined sugar is processed with animal bone char. The charcoal is used to remove color, impurities, and minerals from sugar. The charcoal is not 'in' the sugar, but is used in the process as as a filter. Thus by a process-based definition of vegan, refined sugar may not be considered vegan. For those who would prefer not to use refined sugar, there are several alternatives: raw, turbinado, beet sugar, succanat, date sugar, fructose, barley malt, rice syrup, corn syrup, molasses, and maple syrup.  However, if one accepts a process-based definition of vegan, then many other familiar products would also not be considered vegan. For instance, steel and vulcanized rubber are produced using animal fats and, in many areas, groundwater and surface water is filtered through bone charcoal filters. So, is a box of pasta that contains no animal products, but has transported to the store in a steel truck on rubber wheels and then cooked in boiling water at your home, vegan? Under a process-based definition, possibly not. But according to such a definition, it would be difficult to findany product in this country that is “vegan.”  There is another point about definitions that comes to mind. Perhaps, in the above example, the pasta maker also makes an egg pasta. The same machinery is used, and traces of egg are in the “vegan” pasta; would the pasta not be vegan?  Again, we recommend that vegans concentrate their attention on the most obvious animal ingredients and the true meaning of veganism. In our experience, concentrating on processing or on trace ingredients can make a vegan diet appear exceedingly difficult and dissuade people from adopting it."

vegan,3dkcm6,slightlyturnedoff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:56:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I don't think it's the same as gelatin because the congealed protein is part of the product, whereas there's no actual bones in sugar."
vegan,3dkcm6,satosaison,2,Fri Jul 17 14:01:18 2015 UTC,"Here is why it is different: when there is cross contamination of product through say, shared equipment, you aren't economically contributing to animal cruelty, you are purchasing a product that doesn't utlize any animals.

I'll tell you what I don't consider a reason not to use those things: The view that they go ""wasted"" if you throw them out.

They on purpose picked to use an older ""study""(a non peer reviewed magazine short article) rather than a corrected newer one(by the same entity), why?

vegan,3diuje,cookinmonster,4,Fri Jul 17 00:23:27 2015 UTC,"Actually TNR isn't that effective. Cats live a long time and you have to have a very high percentage of the population neutered or spayed to see any decrease in population at all. Like, over 95% and as close to 100 as possible. This is because cats have so many kittens in a litter with just one fertile pair, and solitary cats will regularly wander into existing colonies where they could mate with other non-neutered ""new"" members. So you need resources to regularly trap as well. It's n uphill battle and even the ""successful"" studies showed a very small decrease in colony numbers over, say, 15 years.  It's sad that animals who could be saved must be killed, but the number of wildlife that die every year from cat predation is truly astounding--yet at the same time invisible to us. We see cats that will die and we feel bad, yes. But every day native animals die from those cats that we don't see. There are plenty of cats in the world, but Australia has a truly unique number of animals endemic to only its environment--they don't live anywhere else. If they go extinct, that's it."
vegan,3diuje,felinebeeline,0,Fri Jul 17 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"Humans are responsible for more harm to other animals than cats are, but we don't go into Southern barbecues and eradicate them. A lot can be learned from Italy's model of management.    TNR programs have been prevalent throughout Italy since 1991, when a no-kill law was passed. This policy declared that “[free-roaming] cats have the right to live free; they are protected and cannot be moved from their colony.” It also mandated that free-roaming cats be sterilized by the local Veterinary Public Services (VPS) and returned to their colony. Crucial to the success of the program are “cat care-takers (known also as ‘‘cat-lovers’’), [who] bec[a]me institutionalised figure[s]. Colony care-takers are gathered in associations; they can have the official assignment of the management of a cat colony if the local VPS and the office for animal welfare agree” (Natoli et al.181).   A study of Rome’s neutering campaign from 1991 to 2000 was limited to the VPS Rome D, one of 5 territories of Rome, because VPS Rome D is the only sector that has been providing Rome with TNR services since the institution of the program. A survey of 103 urban cat colonies showed a decrease in numbers of cats by about 21%. Natoli et al. conclude that “[t]his suggests that all these efforts without an effective education of people to control the reproduction of house cats (as a prevention for abandonment) are a waste of money, time and energy [sic]” (Natoli et al. 180).  This presumption is hasty and unsupported, however, as this study did not establish a causative relationship between TNR and abandonment. A significant negative relationship was demonstrated between time passage after sterilization and cat population numbers, due to mortality. In this study, sterilized colonies showed a 13% increase two years after sterilization, whereas after six years, they decreased by 32%. This study demonstrates that the efficacy of   TNR could be increased if used in conjunction with “an effective educational campaign directed [at] citizens to reduce the high risk of owned-cat abandonment” (Natoli et al. 185)."

However, abandonment and cat emigration from colony to colony certainly reduces TNR's effectiveness because TNR doesn't occur in a vacuum. And colonies, if highly visible, do promote dumping even if Natoli did not specifically study this claim. Though just because it wasn't part of the study design doesn't mean it is useless commentary. In any case, check out Castillo and Clarke's 2003 paper.  And there is no well-defined goal for TNR, which appears to be your argument here. What constitutes a ""success"" in a TNR implementation? Wildlife biologists define that very differently from cat welfare organizations. Even 30% over six years, without looking at any other (less effective) studies, is less than what ecologists (especially in critical areas with endangered or threatened birds) are looking for, which is measurable reduced impact on local wildlife and rapid removal of free-roaming cats. Plus, oftentimes to get good numbers all new kittens need to be removed and adopted out ASAP."

vegan,3djkgp,satosaison,3,Thu Jul 16 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed that it would be unethical, because we need truth in labeling, whether we're avoiding foods for health reasons or philosophical reasons.  However, you are presenting it as a thought experiment, and not as something you think we should actually do. I have seen examples of people enjoying vegan food, and then becoming outraged upon discovering it was vegan. For instance, years ago there was a vegan hotdog cart in my town, and one of the employees told me that some people got mad when they found out they were eating Tofurky. (The cart labeled everything, some people just didn't read the menu closely. Also, considering what is really put in hotdogs and sausages, why is a soy-based product suddenly so disgusting?)  But I've also seen instances in which people unknowingly ate vegan food, and then reacted with surprised delight upon learning what it was. For example, I saw one of Gordon Ramsey's cooking shows, and while I can't say I'm a fan of his, he did seem to have a very open mind when some restauranteurs served him a chicken salad, which he thought was delicious -- and his opinion did not change when he learned it was soy-based.  So really, the way you react after learning that your food was secretly vegan probably says more about the food than it does about you. Of course, I would be angry that any food I ate was mislabeled, merely on principle, but in situations in which someone with no health/philosophical issues ate food without worrying about the ingredients (e.g., just eating food willy-nilly at a potluck), a positive reaction could show that they're more open minded than others might be."

vegan,3djkgp,mchvll,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:24 2015 UTC,I remember reading an article about a cupcakery in Vancouver that was happened to make vegan cupcakes but didn't advertise it as such because it'd be bad for business. That was several years ago so I don't know if it has changed. Why do people have this idea that vegan food (baking especially) isn't as rich and satisfying?? Crazy.
vegan,3djkgp,Addfwyn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:54:49 2015 UTC,"How would you feel if people served you food they said was vegan, but really was meat.  Some people might not know the difference!    You would be, understandably, outraged.  Food labelling is important, and there are people with serious dietary restrictions that need to know what they are eating is what they are really eating.  The horsemeat scandal was a big deal not because it was horsemeat, that is a common food in many countries, but because it was mislabelled and potentially dangerous."

The reason I suggested a subreddit ad, rather than a general pro-vegan ad, is that subreddit ads are free. Free advertising isn't something that vegans can get a lot of, and with a subreddit ad we can reach a lot of people."
vegan,3dgbe5,llieaay,9,Thu Jul 16 02:31:28 2015 UTC,"We are a strong enough community that we can handle a few more trolls. Especially with the new expanded mod team!  We often have people say they decided to go vegan because of this subreddit, or they were finally able to make the change or joined out of curiousity and now they are committed or whatever it is. I think there is good evidence that having a vegan news feed and active forum is far more helpful than a one off ad. It's repeated ads and support, which is necessary because most people take some time between when they first realize all is not well with eating animals and when they become vegans or activists. And new vegans are far more likely to stick with it if they have support as well -- and whent they don't have in-person support, this forum might be the next best thing.  So, I think this is an awesome idea. Growing /r/vegan will grow veganism."

vegan,3dgbe5,mmmveggiebacon,3,Thu Jul 16 07:06:26 2015 UTC,though approval isn't guaranteed   I think this is important. Reddit isn't going to want to promote an ad that might turn users off. The three ads you link to appeal to reddit's demographic. An /r/vegan ad would appeal to a minority of people. I think the point of those sub ads are to show normal users new subs that they might enjoy. I'm skeptical that an ad for /r/vegan would be approved.  (maybe if we bring back Pao she could pull some strings haha)

vegan,3dgbe5,Nutritarian,2,Thu Jul 16 03:37:22 2015 UTC,How do we do it?
vegan,3dgbe5,Nutritarian,7,Thu Jul 16 09:02:31 2015 UTC,"Here's my thoughts:    Create a thread with the submission requirements in the description and people could submit their ads and the most upvoted by a certain date/time gets submitted.  There'd probably be two categories, one for the best image ad, and one for the best text based ad, as both should be submitted for the ad to be considered. There could be some kind of reward for the winner in each category, but there doesn't have to be. Once the community has chosen the ads, somebody (preferably a mod) submits the result to /r/Subredditads. We wait to see if it gets approved.   I do want to make sure the mods are on board with the idea, though, because they'll be the ones dealing with any trolls that come as a result. I think that any increase in trolling will be more than worth it for the opportunities provided, but if the mods don't think the same, then ultimately it's their decision."

vegan,3dh0of,sylvan,13,Thu Jul 16 05:09:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a molecular scientist or an agricultural scientist, but I'm an ecologist. AFAIK, there is absolutely zero evidence that GMO crops are unhealthy or bad for human consumption. I do have some concerns over potential ecological effects, but typical (GMO or not) agriculture is full of preventable ecological problems-- notably things like huge swathes of monoculture, fertilizer run-off, and poor erosion control.    One thing that really annoys me about people that are adamantly ""pro-GMO"" though, is that they act like GMOs are some amazing innovation that will magically solve world hunger issues. What is so bizarre about that claim? We already grow enough food to feed every single person on the planet with a surplus, but we do grossly inefficient things like feed most of it to livestock. For example, in the US alone we could feed 800 million people with the food we feed to livestock.    BTW, the UN WFP says that 795 million people in the world are malnourished..."
vegan,3dh0of,askantik,2,Thu Jul 16 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"poor erosion control   Roundup Ready traits crops allows for the very effective glyphosate to be used, leading to no-till which prevents soil erosion."
vegan,3dh0of,ribbitcoin,-2,Fri Jul 17 01:05:14 2015 UTC,as an ecologist of course you know that growing enough food to feed every person with a suplus will result in geometric population growth -- do you think we have enough food to feed every person 50 years from now? i'm honestly interested!
vegan,3dh0of,kivishlorsithletmos,2,Thu Jul 16 17:57:02 2015 UTC,growing enough food to feed every person with a suplus will result in geometric population growth   Even if true letting people starve is not an acceptable way of population control. I would think this should be quite obvious in an ethics centred subreddit like this one.  In fact countries with less poverty have generally a lower population growth rate than those with more poverty.  You can compare this map showing global poverty distribution with this one showing fertility rates.
vegan,3dh0of,zolartan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"i think you've misunderstood my point completely-- we need to prepare not only to feed everyone alive right now, but the also the people who will exist as a consequence of that principle.  do you really think that feeding everyone in the world with nutritional, healthy food will result in fewer people reproducing and being alive? that's kind of unfathomable and i'm no malthusian."
vegan,3dh0of,kivishlorsithletmos,2,Thu Jul 16 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"I see. So you are not actually arguing for the status quo. You are basically afraid that the hunger issue (or human population growth) cannot be solved because once more food is provided to everybody the population will grow faster? This would lead to an increase in food demand and then again in population and so on?  Just looking at the mortality rate one could come to this conclusion. But if you also consider fertility rate the picture can be completely different. As shown in the map I linked more poverty generally correlates with higher fertility rates. There are many reasons why a fairer wealth distribution (food for everybody) could lead to a lower fertility rate and thus a slower population growth:   Without social security the parents will be dependent on their children in old age. Because not all children survive and not all will have enough income later having more children is often the safer bet. Abolishing poverty (by introducing a basic income) would give more people the freedom to have less or no children. more financial means for contraceptives better education → knowledge about contraceptives and family planning There are quite a few negatives for having children: lifetime commitment, reduced personal freedom and flexibility, financial burden, etc. Many people in western countries therefore decide against having children and the population might even decrease if not compensated by immigration (e.g. in Germany).   Because of these considerations I don't believe its “ unfathomable” at all that the world's population could in fact decrease when poverty is abolished."
vegan,3dh0of,zolartan,16,Fri Jul 17 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"I've never understood the backlash GMOs get.  It's neither an inherently positive or negative concept, food can be genetically modified in ways that are both good or bad for the end consumer.    I just see it as a faster way of obtaining the same results that agriculture has been reaching for years via selective breeding.  Take our friend the banana for instance.    That doesn't mean all GMOs are good either, just that we should be looking at them on a case by case basis, not grouping them all together in the same basket."
vegan,3dh0of,Addfwyn,7,Thu Jul 16 06:30:51 2015 UTC,"Submitter comment: veganism is often considered to overlap with the anti-GMO movement. Veganism is based on the principle that animals are sentient organisms with the capacity to experience suffering, and it is unethical to cause them to suffer when we can meet our nutritional and physical needs elsewhere. There's nothing related to genetic modification of plants in that position.  GMOs are not inherently bad for the environment, animals, or agriculture in general, and show numerous potential benefits. Rejecting GM produce on the basis of unscientific fear or propaganda is unwarranted, and may carry a far more serious human and environmental cost."

In respect of suing over accidental cross-contamination (which would normally apply when people talk about innocent farmers), it's never happened.

Innocent of the allegations against them. Monsanto is/has aggressively attacked non-copyrighted seed market.

I'm sure you see this as a great tragedy, innocent till proven guilty?  See the food inc clip on this topic.

But couldn't afford it in the end and settled. I'm sure you see this as a great tragedy, innocent till proven guilty?   Source for this case? Because unless the guy willingly bought seeds, agreed not to save them, then saved them, there would be no case to answer for.   See the food inc clip on this topic.   Food Inc made up a load of claims. As in, straight-up just pulled them out the air and claimed them as ""fact"". I'll explain more below...   What's given you such certainty (that Monsanto don't sue over accidental cross-contamination)?    The case of OSGATA vs Monsanto. In a nutshell, OSGATA led a class-action lawsuit against Monsanto to stop them suing over accidental cross-contamination. OSGATA's case was thrown out of court when they had to admit they were unaware of even one single case where this had ever actually happened in real life, nor had a single one of OSGATA's 300,000 members even been threatened with a lawsuit.  So if a team of lawyers dedicated to the task cannot dig up even one case of this ever happening (remember that lawsuits are public record, so you and I can search for them too), then it's pretty fair to conclude that no such cases do exist.  So when Food Inc state that Monsanto sue farmers who had seed blow onto their land, they are literally just making it up because they know the audience for their documentary will just blindly accept it as fact.   Bob is an organic farmer. Bob doesn't want to work with Monsanto, because that wouldn't be organic   Monsanto also sell organic seeds too.    Bob uses a non-copyrighted organic pesticide (bt) , it will soon be ineffective because Monsanto used it in a unsustainable way, promoting the evolution of bt resistance (constant exposure will do that). Now bob has no effective pesticide.    Except (a) the organic industry uses far more BT than GM crops do, and (b) that's not quite how it works.   I'm against monopolies manipulating government to get more power, and it's particularly frightening when these companies dominate the agriculture sector.   They hardly dominate the agricultural sector. I know the narrative says that Monsanto control the entire food industry (presumably from their evil volcano lair while stroking a white cat), but they are really only involved in the seed market (a relatively tiny part of the overall food industry) and of that market, they only have 30% of the market. They aren't even the biggest player either.  So the notion that they control the ag sector doesn't add up."

This is absolutely not a problem, as standard ag practices don't run contrary to the restrictions patents bring.   i can't believe you'd argue in favor of standard ag practices. i will not try to change your mind on that issue, but it sticks out to me. i think farmers are being taken advantage of and are completely manipulated by the absurd set of incentives for growing that are outside of their manipulation. generations of commercials farmers have relied on practices that are essentially permaculture and seed-sharing/reusing. the new practices of GMO farming run counter to this and in many cases produce better results, especially for nutritional density and profit, two things that matter a lot to farmers. so why is this a problem? because it's just many cases, not every case, but it's being forced in every case including litigation against farmers who exist independent of the ag system you are describing."

Have a read...  The key quote is ""Contrary to what some say, GM seeds are not the only seeds with Intellectual Property Rights.  Almost all conventional (non-GM) and organic hybrid seeds are patented and cannot be saved for use in the next planting season"".   generations of commercials farmers have relied on practices that are essentially permaculture and seed-sharing/reusing.   In all fairness though, many farmers for millennia have relied on horses or oxen to pull farm machinery. That doesn't mean it's the most efficient method today. The reason farmers don't save seed today, and why the practice hasn't been standard for nearly a century since the advent of hybrids, is that hybrid vigour means desired traits are bred out in subsequent generations. Therefore to ensure consistency (which is what the farmers' customers, the food distributors, want) they buy their seeds every year rather than reusing them. I know it's not common knowledge outside the industry, but saving seeds is as outdated as using a horse to pull your plough rather than a tractor.   because it's just many cases, not every case, but it's being forced in every case including litigation against farmers who exist independent of the ag system you are describing.

Moving away from seed-saving happened in 1930 as well, and was nothing to do with Monsanto. Seed-saving is obsolete because with subsequent generations, the quality greatly diminishes due to hybrid vigour.

Glyphosate-tolerant crops allow farmers to reduce heavy tillage (and the resulting runoff). They have also reduced or mitigated the usage of really toxic herbicides. Post emergence weed control also means fewer passes over fields, meaning less fuel and emissions.  Bt expression has nearly eliminated insecticide application for many crops.  Other notable but relatively new modifications include potatoes that bruise less easily and produce less acrylamide when cooked and apples that are slower to brown.  Then you have the more famous golden rice that could potentially eliminate Vitamin A deficiency.  Also the lesser known but definitively proven GMO papaya. Transgenic modification saved the Hawaiian papaya industry from the devastating ringspot virus.  And this is just the immediate effects. The introduction of GMO cotton to India has improved economic security among farmers and reduced exposure to pesticides."

vegan,3dh0of,shahgaltaligu,0,Mon Jul 20 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"That is fair enough, I suppose.  First ,a general outline: Genetic modification is not new. New cultivars of plants have been produced for longer than anyone remembers - nobody even knows why we started cultivating plants towards becoming potato plants, as the original plants we evolved them from are inedible. We've been doing targeted cross-breeding and cultivation forever. What is new is the precision at the gene level, and the breadth of selected traits - you can't breed a carrot plant with a rice plant, but you can copy the gene of a carrot that makes it produce beta-carotene and insert it into a rice plant's genome, thus making a new species of rice that can supply millions of people with a new source of (desperately needed) vitamin A. (This is outlined in the article.) So essentially, GM gives us the opportunity to change certain species of plants to better suit our own needs.   All GM consists of is making a plant produce a protein it has not produced before, or in a larger or smaller quantity. That's all there is to it. Effects vary by protein and volume, of course, but we're not talking about plutonium and weirdly coloured liquids made from fetus tears in a Monsanto-Approved Mad Scientist Lab.  Some specific benefits:   GM can decrease the need for traditional, sprayed insecticides (something of a mixed bag, as outlined at the end of the article), which may be harmful. It can be used to increase crop yields greatly. It allows us to grow plants in places where they normally could not (producing heat- or cold-resistant plants is a big one), allowing huge benefit for food or industry production. It enables us to save species of plants that ordinarily would have died off (see the papaya example in the article).   It's important to understand that not all GMOs are the same. You might as well dismiss ""chemicals"" or ""pills"" as harmful or beneficial - each new organism has to be evaluated separately from the others."

In addition, none of its major claims can be verified.   but I imagine that would be something you would discredit as I discredit your science   Science can only be discredited with logic, reason and evidence.  Even if wrong, it can be revised and tested again to add to our knowledge.  Science means much that.  It comes from the Latin word 'scientia' meaning knowledge.  Science promises nothing.  Religion tries to claim to has all the answers and therefore cannot learn and change."

vegan,3dhv1l,probably__mike,3,Thu Jul 16 12:39:03 2015 UTC,"definitely use cronometer.com, myfitnesspal.com, or nutritiondata.self.com to see for yourself how complete your nutrient intake is. It seems so daunting at first, but it becomes pretty intuitive once you start to see patterns with which vitamins and minerals come from which kinds of foods.   As a quick general tip, you'll get more vitamin D from sunlight than you can ever dream of getting from any practical amount of almond milk. Just make sure you're getting regular intake of vitamin K to help your skin synthesize the sunlight. Vitamin D absorption is most prominent in the presence of vitamin K, so foods like Kale and spinach (careful with spinach, too much can be no good for your kidney because its high in oxalates) and most other leafy greens are solid choices.   Also, definitely supplement B12. No questions asked. Your almond milk may say 100% B12 in 1 cup, but you're not actually absorbing 100% of the B12 you need. People usually supplement 6,000% a day to make sure enough is absorbed to maintain healthy levels. Absorption rate for B12 is pretty low, so don't just trust fortified foods with your health. It's a million times cheaper just to buy a supplement.   Other quick tips to get the most out of your foods; coffee and tea will inhibit the absorption of iron, so make sure you space out your consumption of those items and your ""iron"" foods. Also, on the contrary, vitamin C will triple the absorption of Iron, so it's never a bad idea to have some vitamin C food like citrus or bell peppers before your meals."
vegan,3dhv1l,theterminizer,3,Thu Jul 16 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"Also, definitely supplement B12. No questions asked. Your almond milk may say 100% B12 in 1 cup, but you're not actually absorbing 100% of the B12 you need.    Yeah, and I've never seen fortified milk with more than 50%. Take a B12 supplement."
vegan,3dhv1l,probably__mike,2,Thu Jul 16 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"Damn, thank you, this is some great advice. I'd never thought much about some vitamins/minerals inhibiting others. I'm glad you mentioned about spinach as well, because I eat a lot of it. Do you think alternating between kale and spinach would be a better idea?  I haven't thought about absorption rates either, I'll probably go out and grab some tomorrow. I can't afford to buy too many different supplements, do you think buying some multi-vitamin tablets and taking half of one a day as a 'booster' is an okay idea?"
vegan,3dhv1l,Nutritarian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I would definitely alternate between spinach and kale, and even some other leafy greens if you can find some others that you like! I personally only really like Kale and sometimes lettuce, so I usually just stick to kale.   The only thing I supplement is B12, Ive tracked my typical days worth of eating and was surprised to find that I exceeded every vitamin and mineral, and even was getting like, 260% for iron, which is supposedly ""hard to get"" as a vegan. Just eat a wide variety of foods every day and as long as you're eating enough calories, you'll more likely than not be meeting and exceeding most, if not all, of your vitamin/mineral needs. If you find that you're not getting enough of a certain nutrient via one of those websites, then you could opt for the multi vitamin just to fill the gap or play it safe. You'll most likely find that you're eating way better than you think you are, even without supplemented foods.   Every day I shoot for maybe 3 different fruit, a nut, a seed, grain, bean/legume, leafy green, snack on like, 2 or 3 different kinds of veggies, a root vegetable, some kind of citrus, and a LOT of water. And it's helpful to mix up what kind of nut products or seed products you're eating day by day. Most plants foods have quite different nutrient profiles, so mixing up your foods will help meet all your needs. There's also nonessential phytochemicals, antioxidants, and stuff like that that differs from plant to plant, all of which are definitely health promoting, although not considered essential. Some people just brush it off, but i think it's beneficial to have, for example, brown rice one day, then black rice the next, wild rice, long grain, jasmine, sushi rice etc. Don't stress too much, but I've found food a million times more enjoyable when every day there's something different.   edit: oh and also, you don't have to stuff your face every meal with all the variety. it's better to eat lesser amounts of a wide variety of foods than it is to eat a huge amount of just one food. Definitely opt for smaller portions of more foods than for huge portions of less foods."
vegan,3dhv1l,Life-in-Death,2,Thu Jul 16 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"I really don't think celery, carrots and cucumbers are things you want to be eating for breakfast, simply because they're so low calorie and they're not going to give you any energy at all. They're more of a late time snack. I'd definitely recommend picking up John Mcdougall's Starch Solution, as starch, or complex carbohydrates as well as a lot of fruit is key to sustaining a vegan diet. For breakfast I'd focus more on starches or fruit like oat and banana pancakes with fruit, or oatmeal with cut u bananas and dates and maybe some syrup or cacao nibs if you want some chocolately flavour. For Lunch I typically eat sweet potato and kale fritters or something starchy, like brown rice with a curry. Again, you can't just have a salad with some kidney beans! No way are you going to feel full or nourished. And again for dinner, if youre just having brussel sprouts, spinach and mushrooms, youre pretty much burning off more calories than youre getting. You need some rice! Potatoes! Beans!"

In terms of lunch, it isn't just a salad with some kidney beans haha. Like I said, there will be oil added, as well as plenty of calorific nuts. Sweet potato and kale fritters sound lovely though, I just wouldn't have any way of reheating them at college.   From what you've said I'm considering having maybe some oatmeal with berries nuts and banana between my breakfast lunch.

vegan,3dhv1l,OuijOuij,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects [1] (Table 4). Most reports suggest a toxicity threshold for vitamin D of 10,000 to 40,000 IU/day and serum 25(OH)D levels of 500–600 nmol/L (200–240 ng/mL). While symptoms of toxicity are unlikely at daily intakes below 10,000 IU/day, the FNB pointed to emerging science from national survey data, observational studies, and clinical trials suggesting that even lower vitamin D intakes and serum 25(OH)D levels might have adverse health effects over time. The FNB concluded that serum 25(OH)D levels above approximately 125–150 nmol/L (50–60 ng/mL) should be avoided, as even lower serum levels (approximately 75–120 nmol/L or 30–48 ng/mL) are associated with increases in all-cause mortality, greater risk of cancer at some sites like the pancreas, greater risk of cardiovascular events, and more falls and fractures among the elderly. The FNB committee cited research which found that vitamin D intakes of 5,000 IU/day achieved serum 25(OH)D concentrations between 100–150 nmol/L (40–60 ng/mL), but no greater. Applying an uncertainty factor of 20% to this intake value gave a UL of 4,000 IU which the FNB applied to children aged 9 and older, with corresponding lower amounts for younger children.  Table 4: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin D [1] Age Male    Female  Pregnancy   Lactation 0–6 months    1,000 IU (25 mcg)    1,000 IU (25 mcg) 7–12 months   1,500 IU (38 mcg)    1,500 IU (38 mcg) 1–3 years 2,500 IU (63 mcg)    2,500 IU (63 mcg) 4–8 years 3,000 IU (75 mcg)    3,000 IU (75 mcg) ≥9 years  4,000 IU (100 mcg)   4,000 IU (100 mcg)   4,000 IU (100 mcg)   4,000 IU (100 mcg)  That chart didn't work but oh well.

I know I've had to kind of censor myself in work settings with similar discussions, but amongst friends and family (and friends of family and family of friends) these kinds of open conversations are important to opening people's eyes.  That being said, I've been told by other vegans I may be too extreme at times. I went with my best friend (also vegan) to a store last week... And the shop apparently had taxidermy. She told me that my disgust was ""palpable"" in the store. While I didn't say anything, she also told me that my disgust expression when I see people eating meat is starting to show.  I think, all in all, it's about a balance. Advocate for animal liberation when it's in a setting that will work, especially to people who may be receptive. But at times, it is more comfortable to just lie low, especially if you have issues with social phobia. It all comes down to the phrase ""Pick your battles.""

These type of people are pointless arguing with and I have actually distanced myself from them in the past few months. On the other hand my family and some of my other friends are more open minded and really listen and take in information that I calmly provide them and have even started eating a few vegan meals a week!:) Pretty soon you'll learn what people are willing to be informed and those who wish to live in ignorance.

vegan,3dgwgi,quitredditreadonly,2,Thu Jul 16 10:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that you've been so stressed and having to deal with this. It's hard being a new vegan. I fumble a lot with my words and have to play sentences in my head over and over again because I have social anxiety and just hate confrontation. The hardest part about being vegan for me is the social aspect, and I already have a very very tiny group of friends.  So I guess my advice would be to bide your time. Research more in depth. Arm yourself with the facts. Once you have a strong understating of something, it's easier to explain.  If someone bugs you about veganism, try to give simple answers or suggest they watch a documentary/video. ""I'm just not in the mood/too mentally taxed to discuss this right now... but If you really want to understand my feelings on the subject watch [Earthlings/Cowspiracy/Forks over Knives/Vegucated]""  They have been ignorantly eating meat their entire lives and almost none of their opinions are based on any research, just popular ""facts"" that they have taken in overtime through osmosis whenever the topic comes up. It's not something they've ever truly cared about or else they wouldn't present such faulty logic or ask such ridiculous questions. If they do care, they are clinging onto excuses and trying to put it away in the back of their mind. Most of the time, their asking you questions is just an opportunity to try and validate themselves. They want answers where they can either dismiss your feelings as silly or find a loophole in which they are absolved of responsibility. ""Jenny eats vegan but she's rich! I'm not rich. I cannot be vegan."" When you know the facts and can present them with confidence and accuracy, they have no loopholes. All that is left in the end is admitting that they just do not care, or dismissing you for petty reasons such as ""taste.""

vegan,3dgwgi,rangda,2,Thu Jul 16 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"If they say ""God put animals on this Earth to eat"" ask them why people shouldn't eat dogs/cats then, but don't do it in an angry way- just a curious way. And gently explain that grass fed/cage free does not mean there's no cruelty involved, etc. If they get angry at all that, it's their problem really. Just try to maintain a sense of calm when answering the questions, even though it's hard, and know that there are more and more people each day who are waking up to the reality of it all."
vegan,3dgwgi,vegetargaryen,4,Thu Jul 16 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel guilt when I don't speak up about things I see. Anything from hypocritical happy livestock mascots, or meat commercials, down to an omni expressing their ""love"" for animals, I feel like I need to use my ability as an articulate human to speak up for the literal billions of voiceless animals that are being tortured at that moment. They can't speak up for themselves, y'know? I feel self-conscious about how often I get my sad Sarah McLachlan slots into daily conversations, but it's because I'm confronted with animal abuse ALL THE TIME and nobody else even bats an eye to it! I feel like it's my duty to keep reminding people."
vegan,3dgwgi,misskinky,3,Thu Jul 16 07:05:29 2015 UTC,"I've been vegan for just over a decade now. I never wanted to be that vegan. You know, the preachy, holier-than-thou type? Well, I think I've hit my breaking point recently.  It started with an innocent picture of my Beyond Meat beast burger. Then I get comments like ""Plants have feelings too!"" and ""Living without cheese is no life at all!"" I snapped. I decided to say Fuck it to thoughts of self-doubt, (when it comes to posting on Facebook at least), and just share all sorts of links.   The funny thing is, my links are still somewhat harmless. I had something about Ben & Jerry's testing a vegan flavor, and a picture of a meal I had recently. Granted, these posts alone didn't net any comments, but soon after, my former roommate posts something about his FB feed being inundated with vegan propaganda and whatnot. I know he's trolling so I've restrained myself as much as I could, but goddamnit. Yeah, fuck me for posting meals I love and phrases I hear when others find out I'm vegan, right?  I'm so sick of it.  Anyway, I guess my point is don't feel bad about it. If you're not preachy now, you will be so just revel in it. Most omnis know subconsciously that they too can avert suffering if they really tried. They just feel bad because they choose not to, and project their shitty feelings onto us. Keep on keeping on, brother/sister."

No debating, no arguing, no exasperated explanations needed."
vegan,3dgwgi,misskinky,2,Thu Jul 16 13:26:30 2015 UTC,"I totally get this. I often worry that I'm being a preachy vegan, but all I try to do is answer questions honestly. When my friends and family ask questions about why I went vegan I don't want to lie, so I say ""environmental and ethical reasons"" - that works until the inquire further, and I have to explain why it's bad environmentally and ethically. That makes me preachy. When they ask how I feel about being vegan I expound about how much I love it, how great I feel, and how peaceful it is. That makes me preachy. All I want to do is share something I love with the people I love, and I always feel terrible about half way through, when I see the disinterest and resent on their faces. I don't want to be a stereotype, but should I keep quiet about what is now a major facet of my personality because of that? I don't know. All I know is it always goes the same way - they ask, I respond with a short, non-inflammatory answer, they ask more, I answer more, and then I'm the preachy vegan hippy.   What I'm trying to do, and have to remind myself of every time the topic comes up is live by the saying of Marcus Aurelius : ""Don't explain your philosophy, embody it."" I fail each time, but I'm getting better at it. Slowly."

But if not I guess just treasure what you had and accept that you two are just not compatible as friends anymore. That's got to hurt though. I haven't had that happen yet, but I worry that it will. I'm glad you're passionate about it though, passion is great in life. Even in small ways, like walking around a new greengrocers and being super excited about all the fresh fruit and veg you have to try! I love those moments :)"

vegan,3dhzmg,Ariyas108,17,Thu Jul 16 12:48:28 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing. I was vegan ten years ago, in suburban Florida. Whole Foods was a godsend. It was literally the only place I could buy tofu, tempeh, or seitan, let alone anything frozen and ready to eat. If you are in a less urban area, it may be your only chance to purchase things like tofurkey products, gardein, or beyond meat, and so for many people, they are making it easier and more enjoyable to go and stay vegan.  The reason they get so much hate on here, is they engage in cruelty-washing through programs like their animal welfare rating system, which has farcical enforcement, and convinces people that by buying ""grass fed"" or ""free range"" that they are not really harming animals. This is a problem because as long as people picture happy animals living on some grassy farm having the good life until they are called to become food, they aren't going to go vegan. The realities of the food industry would cause many to stop eating meat if only they knew.  Whole Foods is probably a net good in this regard, and they made my vegan life so much better for so many years. But they aren't perfect.  All that said, they are a horrible unethical company when it comes to their union busting employee abusing ways and that's why I don't shop there, but this is r/vegan, and not a labor rights forum."
vegan,3dhzmg,satosaison,10,Thu Jul 16 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"living on some grassy farm having the good life until they are called to become food   this made me think about that book where there's kids, who are really clones of rich adults, living on some school in some farm somewhere just waiting for their organs to be harvested for the adults to live forever. it's weird how people do make it seem (at least in arguments with vegans) that the ultimate purpose of a ""food"" animal is to become food and in doing so it is fulfilled."

Stuff like coconut vinegar, may of the bobs red mill nut flour products, premade seitan, coconut palm sugar, hemp seeds, vegan kimchi, coconut kefir, and a variety of ""pure"" ingredient soaps and shampoos that I definitely couldn't stumble upon in any of the other stores in my town. It piques my interest with new foods, but I never regularly shop there. I'm in LA and we have the dopest farmer markets for produce and a lot of specialized small-business's and artisanal shops to buy high quality non-produce items.

vegan,3dfyq3,Inasaba,13,Thu Jul 16 16:03:18 2015 UTC,Why? What would be the reason?  The definition of Vegan is in the side bar. If someone who eats plant based but wears leather is uncomfortable with ethics is it our responsibility to change to suit them?   Anything that gets people to stop using animals is wonderful but Veganism is about ethics.  If someone is beating their wife you tell them it is wrong to beat their wife and that she has the right not to be abused.  You don't tell them how much better she will look without a black eye or how much quieter it will be when she is not sobbing after a beating. Lessening environmental impact is wonderful.  Improved health is wonderful.  Veganism is about ethics.

Having information about why environmentalism shares some goals with veganism would be great, I would fully support that. I also first become vegetarian because of the environment, so I appreciate the importance of using the full arsenal of arguments in favour of reducing production of animal products. However, the implication that people feel 'unwelcome' because a forum dedicated to an ethical philosophy is talking about that ethical philosophy is a bit of a red flag to me.  Not giving up the core meaning of veganism doesn't mean that we disagree with environmental reasons or that environmentalists are unwelcome."
vegan,3dfyq3,jm434,11,Thu Jul 16 08:30:24 2015 UTC,"This is along my thoughts in that I don't want to take away from the clear message that veganism is about animal exploitation. Health and environmental benefits are great side effects, but they aren't the point. I'm not against something being added, but not in a way that might confuse people. The point of the link about it being healthy was simply to assure people that it's not a sacrifice to their health to be vegan, not to promote veganism as a health diet."
vegan,3dfyq3,rinabean,7,Thu Jul 16 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"Because people like you turn people away from being vegan.  It's a hard enough decision to go vegan (no matter the reason) due to a loss of community, fringe status and increased 'bullying' by non-vegans. So what do they do? Turn to the vegan community to gain back some semblance of normality and acceptance by your peers.  So then all of a sudden the reason they went vegan is scoffed and derided at by you purists, told they aren't 'real' vegans and told to GTFO. Now they have been rejected by society and vegans and either become 'vegan hating' vegans or revert back to omni and then spread how awful and arrogant vegans are, hurting our 'cause'.  So OP is 100% right and you need to reevaluate yourself.   (I'm in the 'vegan hating' vegan category by the way exactly due to people like you)"

It's our job to educate vegans into becoming environmental, and environmentalists into becoming vegan by making them realise this.   A natural, direct consequence of environmental protection and reduction in its devastation is the giving animals the right to not be exploited and the reduction of their suffering and habitat destruction."
vegan,3dfyq3,jm434,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"You miss the point. Suppose there was a magic way of having enough beef for everyone that still killed the cows. An environmentalist would eat that beef, a vegan wouldn't. Any protection of animal rights that is a result of environmentalist is generally a byproduct.   So, ""Wanting to protect the environment is the same as protecting animals rights"" is not a true statement, and you are calling anyone who thinks it is a fool.  Following that, a vegan is a separate thing from a plant based environmentalist. That's fine - the result is the same, but this sub is about championing animal rights primarily."
vegan,3dfyq3,Fallom_TO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"Your argument is flawed, because it's not about having enough beef to feed everyone, it's about the environmental impact of creating that beef in the first place. That's why it's not a sustainable food source.   My statement is still true, but you correctly point out that it's misleading. It would be a more fair statement if I had said protecting the environment has the direct consequence of protecting animal rights so I concede you this.  So here's what the sidebar says   ""Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose."" - The Vegan Society This is a place for people who are vegans or interested in veganism to share links, ideas, or recipes.   See my bold. Wanting to include environmental reasons falls into these bolded categories, and people ITT wanting environmental vegans to GTFO aren't being true to the actual sidebar message."

In the future they may not be, so someone could be an environmentalist and not vegan at all.  That's where I took offense to you calling me a fool (not directly, but there it is). I don't disagree at all with putting something about the environment in the sidebar, but I do disagree that someone who eats plant based but doesn't otherwise oppose using animals is a vegan.  I'd support putting a couple of links to al subs if they did the same for us - that would be a win."

It's a flaw that I have that hasn't gone away despite my best efforts. So I apologise for indirectly calling you a fool.  I would say that 'vegan' suffers from the 'no true scotsman' fallacy, in that it's impossible to be 100% vegan. We all do something which indirectly results in the death and exploitation of animals, be it using a computer (like we're doing now) or clearing land to grow vegetables. So despite our best efforts, and our opposition to animal exploitation we're only slightly better than 'someone who eats plant based but doesn't otherwise oppose using animals'. The results are the same, while we directly pursue the end of animal exploitation, that 'someone' still does so indirectly."

That isn't sustainable without factory farming or industrial agriculture considering the other option (killing off the majority of the population) is unthinkable.   At least with modern farming and medical techniques we know that we can sustain off a vegan diet which requires significantly less resources than animal farming and has the added benefit of reducing animal suffering. This ignores the white elephant however in that in an ideal vegan world, the domesticated animals lose because there is no longer an incentive to breed and keep them and the alternative of releasing them into the wild would be environmentally destructive (and it's equally unrealistic to say that all these billions of animals will just be placed into sanctuaries)."

You also have the remote human communities to take into consideration, such as the Inuits, Chilean Mountain and Siberian Stepp peoples. They live in environments that you can't farm in, and don't have the money or expertise to operate specialised greenhouses.   Forcing them to go vegan, destroying their way of life (even if I consider it backwards) would be absurd. Fortunately these types of peoples are insignificant in number and have already developed a highly specialised and minimal environmental impact techniques to feed themselves.

Dismissing veganism because you chose to remain ignorant of all the thousands of food options is foolish. Also. 900 calories a day is extremely low.  You could hit 900 calories just by having a coconut milk shake, eating an avocado, and snacking on some nuts.  You never had to survive on beans and starch."

Tomatoes had enough iron and I ate em all the time. (and the sublingual B vitamins too)  But TONS AND TONS of sources I looked up say 54 grams of   protein a day. I bought a lot of tempeh and beans and just hated eating them every day. I also drank this gross vegan protein shake sometimes. Also, nuts have a huge fat content in the amount you need to eat.  Go look at your bag of nuts...  I started gaining weight because I loved eating pasta. And GOOD vegan food. I quit a few weeks into a low calorie vegan diet because I was just so mad and sad all the time. I had no idea how much your mood could change if you were forced to eat just leaves and fruit, raw with not butter or grilling in oilve oil. And vegan hot dogs and vegan burgers just raw. No buns or mustard and ketchup to cover up the taste.  Nowadays I take my mutlivitamin and eat a double cheeseburger and that's literally all I eat and feel more energetic and don't have to track shit! Just chug a v8 100% juice.

vegan,3dfyq3,Istayinbedok,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"I understand the point you are making, and if the definition of vegan truly is ""Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose."", then I would agree with you 100%.   But I want to argue that that isn't the true definition of vegan. Merriam-Webster defines vegan as ""A person who does not eat any food that comes from animals and who often also does not use animal products (such as leather)"". Nowhere in that definition does it say that animal cruelty and exploitation has to be part of it.  And when you look at the Wikipedia page for veganism it says: ""Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.""  So my question for you is why argue that ethical veganism is more important than environmental veganism dietary veganism? Why not just have /r/vegan be inclusive to ALL types of vegans and leave it up to the individual to decide for themselves why they are pursuing a vegan diet?"
vegan,3dfyq3,blargh9001,3,Thu Jul 16 02:41:40 2015 UTC,"If someone wants to remove animal products from their diet and continue to exploit animals in other ways,  /r/plantbaseddiet may be a better fit for them."
vegan,3dfyq3,cainmarko,4,Thu Jul 16 11:14:06 2015 UTC,"The word ""vegan"" was actively invented in 1944 by a group of people who wanted a word to say ""we don't use such stuff for animal rights reasons"". The environmental benefits were just a nice accidental side effect. Some people find it really important to still have a word that says exactly that, because they want to give exactly that reason. Personally I hate to say ""I'm vegan"" (so I don't) because people think it's a dietary/health thing, which I couldn't care less about and which is completely not what I wanted to convey as a reason when asked.     But well, given that people don't understand that anyway when you say ""vegan"", it doesn't really matter if someone says it and means environmental reasons, either."
vegan,3dfyq3,blargh9001,3,Thu Jul 16 06:25:33 2015 UTC,"I think the definition of the society that coined the word vegan takes precedence over the one you just invented, or that someone typed in to Wikipedia. Not acknowledging that orange juice is a type of apple juice doesn't mean that I don't like orange juice. Not changing the definition of veganism to mean environmentalism doesn't mean I think environmentalism is unimportant."
vegan,3dfyq3,rangda,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:35:26 2015 UTC,Not really. The definition of a word depends entirely on what most people think it is and not on what it was invented as. Otherwise they wouldn't have to change so much of the dictionary.
vegan,3dfyq3,theuntamedshrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"That makes sense to a point. Take your type of reasoning too far and words become meaningless and you're better off throwing out the dictionary instead of update it because if I reckon a word means something, that's just as good as what the dictionary says it means.   A words meaning is not some kind of democratic vote, an entomologist saying spiders are not insects takes precedence over common misconceptions. No matter how many grandparents think 'Nintendo' means all computer and video games, the definition of those who actually have an active interest in them takes precedence. Of course, gamers could adopt that definition, and then it would be time to update the dictionary, like Hoover became synonymous with vacuum cleaning.  If 'vegan' was a word that was coined in the 14th century and the original meaning was just a piece of trivia I would agree that insisting on the original meaning would be pedantic. But the original meaning isn't dead yet, it has a large movement attached to it, and it's worth protecting."

Environment and animals go hand in hand. Animals are part of the environment and many people are vegan for both reasons. I personally feel that I should do whatever I can to reduce suffering and part of that is helping the environment, which in turn also helps animals, just as helping animals also helps the environment in the case of veganism.

So then all of a sudden the reason they went vegan is scoffed and derided at by you purists, told they aren't 'real' vegans and told to GTFO. Now they have been rejected by society and vegans and either become 'vegan hating' vegans or revert back to omni and then spread how awful and arrogant vegans are, hurting our 'cause'.

Honestly you could eat veal occasionally, go to SeaWorld, and buy cosmetics tested on animals and still drastically reduce your environmental footprint and be very healthy, it's just not vegan. It's great to reduce your impact and if everyone became mostly vegan that'd be great, but why change the definition of vegan (which was coined by Donald Watson and his wife) to cater to flexitarians?  There's a lot of posts on here from environmental/health vegans who put in their post something to the effect of ""not in it for the animals, sorry"". Are you really suggesting we ignore that and don't mention animal testing or leather? I don't understand why they feel they must be considered vegans, they should just say ""I eat a plant based diet for health or for the environment"" and when they ask ""oh you're vegan?"" Just say ""no cause I wear leather and don't do it for the animals"" it's not too much to ask.

If you don't give people like me a chance to be welcomed into the community, so that we can learn that being ethical is a large a part as being healthy or environmentally friendly, than people with less conviction than me will give up.  Vegan is not a scientifc term, and as such its meaning can change. Just like how normal language evolves. And it has, the term vegan has evolved to consider not just pure ethical arguments but also to consider health and environmental reasons.  Vegans are a fringe minority of our species, and that will remain the case as long as public perception is so negative. The more people that adopt veganism (whatever their initial reason may be), the more it will grow and become accepted. To reject those who aren't 'pure' vegans is to remain an extremist group, be associated with the likes of PETA and others like them.   It's similar to vegetarianism, we (vegans) know that from an ethical standpoint vegetarians are morally hypocritical.

Personally, I haven't totally decided how I'd like to deal with it. Right now, I am supportive, positive, and encouraging towards vegetarian (and plant-based) friends, while also letting them know how great and easy veganism is. It's just tough when we're spreading this idea that veganism means you can help animals and spread their message when it's convenient for you, but you can still wear leather, support animal testing, ignore the treatment that animals receive at factory farms, etc. The point of veganism IMO is boycotting these practices and spreading awareness of them, not personal purity in not wanting to ingest cheese, so when these components are ignored I can't help but feel some people are missing the point and not contributing to the positive moves forward.  ANY changes people make are positive, whether they be flexitarian, vegetarian, plant-based, or just curious, but I'm not sure why we need to change what veganism means when all of these different steps of positivity are out there."

I admire the intent, but it's all very vague & wishy-washy language that doesn't really seem to mean anything concrete.  Unless you quantify what ""fair"" actually means, in relative detail, it can pretty much mean anything, and may not actually be fair.... just like how ""humane"" meat really doesn't mean it's actually humane because the guidelines are so wishy-washy and ill-defined, pretty much any factory farm can circumvent them with ease and still abuse animals and get the ""humane"" label."
vegan,3df7e1,anachronic,12,Wed Jul 15 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"I did some digging and out of curiosity I'll try to answer your questions the best I can. These answers aren't good, but they're not awful in comparison to other factories.   Here we go.   How long are shifts?   There doesn't appear to be a definite hours-per-day regulation, but there is a weekly hourly limit. ""Working hours will not exceed 60 hours a week - above the legal amount (49/week), but lower than industry standards""   How many breaks do they get during a shift?   Unfortunately, by the looks of it, zero.   Are they paid in cash or company scrip?   Although I see no mention of cash, there is the mention of a paycheck here. "" the paycheck of a worker at the factory can include other bonusesw like perfect attendance pay and good performance bonuses. In total the paycheck during the month of our production would amount to somewhere between 1800 and 2500 RMB/month, including overtime pay.""   Do they have to live in company dorms?   By the looks of it, there is no obligation to live in the dorms. ""The majority of the workers (70%) lived at the factory dormitory facilities.""   The ""worker welfare fund"" is also really fishy -- they seem to be holding back a portion of the worker's salary in a ""fund"" that can be used at the discretion of the factory owners.   ""... we are working on forming a Worker Welfare Fund, a fund that will be governed by factory worker representatives in dialogue with factory management, and Fairphone. Remember the premium of $2.50 for each phone sold? If not, just take another look at our cost breakdown.  Well, this money will be matched by Changhong so, doing the math, that puts us at $5 per sold phone that will be given to the fund. How this money is spent will be decided upon in consultation with the above-mentioned representatives. You can think of certain items like bonus pay-outs and leisure activities to skill training, personal development and team building. For your understanding, this does not include any items that are part of the factory’s responsibility under legal compliance. In effect, by establishing this fund, workers will get a channel to fairly select representatives on the fund and co-decide on what happens with the investment you made.""   They also don't seem to do any spot checks or third-party quality audits of the assembly facility in China to ensure the factory is actually adhering to whatever (unknown) guidelines they claim to follow.   ""In order to get a baseline understanding of the conditions at Changhong, we worked with TAOS. As you can read in their guest blog, TAOS is a local Chinese organization and will partner with us for the duration of this journey. To determine the conditions at the factory and allow for improvements to take place before Fairphone production started, TAOS carried out a social assessment in August 2013 – a first for the factory in Chongqing. This was based on the Ethical Trading Initiative’s (ETI) Code of Conduct.""  Source  Hopefully that shines some light on their operations for other curious redditors.  Finally, to quote Fairphone:   The Fairphone is still far from “fair”, but it’s a starting point for our step-by-step journey. Source"

I guess it depends on what you consider high-end, but that price sounds about right to me. But even with those high-end phones, the prices are off-contract. If you're like me and are planning on staying with your carrier, signing the contract and getting the upgrade price is going to save you money.   I did look around though, as I was curious to see what the numbers would be. What made me automatically think that most people could not be spending that much money on smartphones is that a third of people are in the lower class, and surely not everyone in the middle class would have to have the latest smartphone.   Here's what I found (I accept that you took back what you said, but since I looked it up and we came to discuss it, I figure I'll share):   64% of American adults now own a smartphone of some kind, up from 35% in the spring of 2011. Pew  Overall, the average selling price for all smartphones this year will reach $314, down 6.3% from last year's average selling price of $335. By 2018, the average price will be $267, IDC said.

For me, they matched me in a month, it may take awhile for them to match you depending on your location and/or demographics if the mentee has a preference for age range or gender. Basically, you give them the contact info to give to your mentee and it's up to the mentee really what they want to do, usually they will call/text/email when they're having issues with anything from cravings to family/S.O issues in regards to veganism. I have had two successful mentees turned mentors. You're mostly there for the growing pains of beginner's veganism. I like to think it's something that really makes a positive impact :D"

vegan,3ddsgs,PatheticMTLGirl43,9,Thu Jul 16 14:32:23 2015 UTC,"Your plan would be politically suicide because it is actually psychotic. Instead of killing off people, we need to learn share more and use less.  The rate of reproduction is decreasing all the time and eventually the general population will reach a cap or even possibly decrease. But consumption won't go down as we are taught to value capitalism and consumerism. So in order to survive on this planet with limited resources, we need to figure out an economic, political, and social system that values conservation of resources instead of making products and production cheap at the expense of the planet."
vegan,3ddsgs,vololi,8,Wed Jul 15 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"We're not just 7 billion people though. We're 7 billion people and the 10s of billions of animals we kill every year. The math is hard because humans live a lot longer than the cows we slaughter, but imagine if for every 3 people you saw walking down the street, there was a cow,  some pigs, 10 chickens, a goat, a whole bunch of fish and everyone used their tap water  to hydrate and grow food to feed those animals (imagine what Manhattan would look like). Would you still say that the human population is the biggest problem? That's what's going on right now, it's just the chickens cows etc... are out of sight except when you consume them.  The only reason you think the most rational solution is to reduce the human population is because you never see the animals.  Human population is of course a big problem but we can address animals right now.  Edit: Also important to the problem of reducing the human population is the difficulty in actually getting people to have less children or no children at all, without interfering on their right to have a family if they choose. You can offer birth control and incentives to not have children but ultimately it will still be their choice (unless you want a one child policy).  Reducing the animal population means not breeding them and not relying on them for food.    Also, why not just give up animals in the meantime? Even if humans are the biggest problem, why can't we reduce the livestock population while we figure out how to convince people to have less children?"
vegan,3ddsgs,themodredditneeds,5,Wed Jul 15 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I misread your proposal, but the thing is, as education (especially for women) and health care continue to improve, population control will happen automatically. There are quite a few countries where the reproduction rate >2.0 and in some cases even >1.0.    But even with decreasing population, if consumerism increases, the net difference in our collective carbon footprint will not be enough to make substantiative change. A person in the West has  more than double the footprint of someone living in a ""third world"" or even ""second world"" country. So our primary focus should not be on population control (though it certainly will help, the planet is certainly overpopulated) and but more on overconsumption."

The more people that but the veggie burger=more profit=more suggestions into going into veggie related things.   Vegans need to buy from companies that are trying out a vegan option. The more we support those and buy them, the more the company will probably branch into it more.   TL;DR: You are doing more harm if you don't buy their vegan product cause they sell large amounts of animal products then if you were to buy the vegan product itself."

I think this particular bacon alternative is interesting because it's just a plant, like pure and simple. I know they have coconut bacon, but it requires you to season it.. So to find something that's not a mock meat version would be pretty cool, and taste similar to bacon in its natural form.. (Like black salt makes things taste eggy, just naturally.) And... all the vegan bacon I've had just doesn't do it for me. I haven't really had anything remotely close. What's come close for you?"

When I was omni, I had turkey bacon a handful of times at most. My approach to meaty foods is not one where I miss something and want it replaced; rather, I'm just interested in trying delicious foods. If it tastes like bacon, I guess that communicates what it tastes like most efficiently. I do sometimes wish that there were better ways to describe those vegan products rather than by comparing them to meats.

vegan,3dftu3,RollingTree,6,Wed Jul 15 22:58:13 2015 UTC,"nope nope nope nope nope.  You should try to change your host for your exchange. I am sure the couple is very nice. However, you appear to be going to an extremely small town, population less than 1000, 40 minutes from even a small city (Sioux Falls, SD) in a part of the US where the culture of hunting, eating meat and rural living is common and celebrated. Animal products and processed foods are staples in the diet, and the quality of food overall, especially the quantity of fruits and vegetables, is quite poor. Though people in the Midwestern US are known for being very friendly, not eating meat is seen as highly unusual (I am doubtful they are familiar with the term ""vegan"" at all) and it will be difficult if not impossible for you to eat anywhere outside of their home and find vegan food.  I can only imagine the volume of comments, if not outright hostility you will likely receive. This area of the US is very conservative and highly supportive of animal agriculture and husbandry. We are talking deep into cattle country here. WAY DEEP.  There are many major cities in the US, and suburban areas surrounding them, where vegetarianism and veganism is common, normal, and even celebrated. While it is impossible to know without judging your hosts, I would not count on having an easy time of it. I would push back against your exchange organization and insist on a different placement in an urban area, or think carefully about your willingness to move forward with the experience.  Should you decide to continue with the exchange in South Dakota, reach out to your hosts right away and inform them.  Study their reaction carefully. Be as polite as you can but very direct. I would ask if they are familiar with veganism, define it for them, give examples of foods you cannot eat (milk, butter, ice cream, meat of any kind, fish, chicken, eggs, honey, most baked goods, etc.), and ask them frankly if you think you are a good match for their lifestyles. Don't be rude, but you could explain that given your diet you understand if they have reservations about your placement there. You might ask if they have seen or heard of vegans or plant-based diets, or seen media such as the movie Forks Over Knives (it is on Netflix in the US). This is a good movie to ask about as they might be curious enough to watch it and it is very neutral. Other documentaries might be dismissed as liberal garbage by people who live in such a conservative area.  I would imagine they will do one of two things: Either they will learn about veganism and take you anyway (which would be a good sign that they have open minds, but you are still moving to the middle of nowhere), or they may also recognize the difficulty that you will have living with them and might even support your appeal to the exchange organization, and wish to home a different student. Be polite but firm with your exchange org, especially after gauging your hosts' reaction. If they do not seem anything but open, welcoming and enthusiastic to try to work with your needs (they are real needs, do not dismiss them with quotes!) I would try hard to jump ship. Food is a personal thing and the successful mixing of cultures relies on the sharing of meals.  Since you asked about vegan shops--it does not even look like Marion has a grocery store with such a small population. Your hosts probably go to a grocery store nearby, and to Sioux Falls for any specialty items. Freeman Shopping Center's website looks like it promotes eating vegetables at least. Looks like there are a couple health food stores in Sioux Falls: Pomegranate Market, and a place called Co-Op Natural Foods. Many regular supermarket chains in the US (such as Hy-Vee in this area) now offer a selection of vegetarian and vegan products (such as non-dairy milks), but as I don't live in the area you'd have to wait and see until you go or ask your hosts if any of these products are available locally."
vegan,3dftu3,cookinmonster,2,Thu Jul 16 04:43:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you so so much for taking your time to write this! I wish I could just say no and get another one but sadly it doesn't work like that. I can not decline the host family but I think they can decline me. Of course when I get there I can tell the organization that I don't feel comfortable there (after months of trying to fit in), but that is such a waste of time on both sides.  I'm thinking that when I contact my host family I can give hints that they won't like so that they'll contact the American exchange organization and tell them that I'm not what they expected etc.  Do you know how I should do that?   And also, it's likely I'll just get relocated in the same area as well which is very sad so after I've talked to the host family I need to talk to my organization and ask them if they can talk to the American Organization (who is in charge of location) and try to locate me a more urban place. The organization also told me that they usually don't accept vegans/vegetarians and the reason must be because of instances like this..."
vegan,3dftu3,cookinmonster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:25:49 2015 UTC,"Well I think a discussion of what veganism really is, what foods you can eat, and whst your lifestyle is like, will probably sufficiently get the alarm bells going off in their heads. Dont be afriad to ask them if your lifestyle would be a burden on the both of you. They might find it refreshing that you acknowledge that your diet isn't compatible with some folks. There of course is the small chance that they have vegetarian friends or know someone who went vegetarian and improved their cholesterol or something, and will be open to trying to accommodate your eating habits. Before you talk with them I would decide, beforehand, if they were to embrace your eating habits, would you still want to go? Even with a supportive host family you will have a hard time in groups and gatherings at places like potlucks or really any restaurants. Do you know what they do for a living? Do they farm or ranch? I mean, who knows, they are adventurous enough to want to take in an exchange student. Can I ask which area of the world you are from? If you are from anywhere near Asia I feel like they had to have considered they might get a vegetarian of some sort.  If the American side of the exchange organization is known for placing people in rural areas you might just come up against this again if they try to rehome you. Especially if they've warned you about vegans not being accepted, yikes. Rural America is no joke. I mean, am a grown professional who doesn't have to live with people I don't know and can defend myself and my choices and living there still sounds like a nightmare to me."

vegan,3dge59,rinabean,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:16 2015 UTC,You're not wasting your time but you're not obligated to advocate for the animals 24/7. It's not healthy or sustainable. If you're vegan you have little or no negative impact on animals and the activism is positive impact. It's good to make the world a better place but as long as you're not making it worse it's okay to take a break.
vegan,3dge59,JordyVerrill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:08:05 2015 UTC,"I used to be very active with ""keyboard activism"", but it was changing who I was as a person.  I was become a bitter, angry person and I didn't like it.  I've pretty much stopped now, and I like myself more now.    Everyone is different, everyone handles stuff like this in a different way.  I applaud everyone out there, be it online or in the real world, trying to make a difference.  I just can't do it like I used to."

Oh, two more: Pok Pok has many vegan options that are worth trying (not to be confused with Pok Pok Phat Thai down the street, which is also good and has vegan options but is less remarkable), finally, if you are looking for something really special, check out Kajitsu, it is quite expensive ($95pp tasting menu) but is the only all vegan restaurant in the world with a Michelin Star.

I love Mexican Radio, Blossom, Candle, Sacred Chow (pre menu redesign).   I just went to this Australian restaurant in Astoria that had a vegan menu and the food was amazing.    Vegan Indian and Thai is up my alley.  I miss Madras.  So yes, filling, hearty, spicy, savory and mainly natural.    I also worry about some of the Vegan soulfood.  The sister restaurant to Uptown Juice Bar, which had a lot of the same menu, said all their cheese had casein.  The vegan mac and cheeses at these places all have stretchy cheese."

Additionally, compassion is seen as a womanly trait (for myriad reasons that piss me off), so a man who chooses not to harm animals could be seen as feminine.   If someone has those kinds of broad generalizations about people, they're probably stupid and not worth dating."
vegan,3dj15a,bewareofduck,-8,Thu Jul 16 17:55:15 2015 UTC,Perhaps many vegan women have found that their vegan dates didn't meet their expectations & that contributes to the generalization.

vegan,3dj15a,birdy111,5,Thu Jul 16 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"That's valid. I think you could have approached this question in a less inflammatory way by maybe creating an anonymous survey.    You're likely right in thinking that traditional ideas/stereotypes of masculinity in dating exist even within the vegan community. Even as vegans we're part of the larger culture. Assuming people on this board will publicly acknowledge (or even be consciously aware) of the stereotypes they hold is a long shot.    To get any real information, you'd need something like the IAT (implicit association test). That test has demonstrated before that subjects, including black subjects, exhibit negative associations with dark skin color. I'm not trying to raise a shitstorm here, but draw a comparison that what people say they believe and what their instant reactions are can be very different things."

About four of them will yield enough bacon for maybe ten people. Use a mandolin to get nice even long slices or cut it into slices that are about a quarter inch thick, maybe less. Get a bacon rub going; a big bowl of salt, brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, onion and garlic salt with more of the first ingredients than the latter. I'm still playing with the ratios since mine have come out too salty more than once now. Coat the eggplant in rub and let sit in colander over sink or anywhere else the juices can drip into. 20 to 30 min. rest time. Go drink some water, play with your dog friends and then wash your hands, maybe sing a song.   Prepare a large skillet or pot with enough oil to give the eggplant slices the chance to float. Turn on burner to medium-high.   Wash eggplant slices of excess salt and shake water off. Too much water on the slices will make the oil splatter harder than usual. Put eggplant slices in until they can have their space and cook. Watch eggplant slices turn to the color and flavor of bacon before your very eyes! Flip occasionally and cook for about five minutes. Eggplant will literally look like a slice of bacon, I know you're like, ""Shut up, no way"" but this recipe will give you vegan bacon that is comparable and almost identical to precious pig meat. Great on ELT's and in chili. Let cooked slices dry on brown paper bag or cookie rack"

But it  just doesn't bother me at all, if I get hit on the head and the ethical section of my brain is destroyed I'm pretty sure it will be a rare steak I'll go for first.

It's sort of tongue-in-cheek, although I always found it to be rather absurd.   A few years ago some guy borrowed their catchphrase (""Eat More Chikin""), only he replaced ""chikin"" with ""kale"" for his personal business/campaign to promote kale. Chick-Fil-A attempted to sue him, but he fought back and won. I noticed that one of the images in OP's article featured a group of what appear to be Chick-Fil-A employees wearing white shirts with black spots and the words, ""Got Spots?"" - an obvious reference to Dairy's ""Got Milk?"" ads. I found it terribly ironic that they would attempt to sue someone for borrowing their catchphrase, yet they're okay with borrowing someone else's catchphrase.

vegan,3dbq1i,catjuggler,8,Wed Jul 15 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Ethipiopian Church is a form of Coptic Christianity, they celebrate feast days by fasting, and the observance of fast days requires abstaining from all animal products, but not all food, resulting in a vegan diet for most of the year.

vegan,3dbq1i,VexedCoffee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"7th day Adventist are typically vegetarian, with the justification being that:   Eating meat makes it more likely that you will commit other sins (eating meat appeals to our ""carnal urges"", and this if you eat it it may unleash other carnal urges, such as sexual immorality, violence, murder, lust, jealousy, etc).  Eating meat is unhealthy, and as our bodies belong to God, it is sinful to disrespect or take them for granted (via unhealthy behaviors). (1 Corinthians 6:19) Eating meat can make our bodies impure, which can in turn make us spiritually impure. The bible has several instances of people refusing to eat ""unclean"" meat, opting for a plant-based diet instead, and being blessed as a result. (Daniel 1:8-16) We were vegetarians/vegans in the Garden of Eden, and should aspire to return to that state of purity."

vegan,3ddv8w,dirak,15,Wed Jul 15 14:32:44 2015 UTC,"The reason I never appeal to health when talking about veganism is because it's so easy to poke holes in that argument, and lead you into blind alley like you're in now.  If you focus on the fact you don't eat animals, period, because you don't like how they're treated... it's a lot easier to end conversations about ""good cholesterol"", etc... because it's a moot point if it's good for bad for you, because you don't like how the chickens are treated, period.  The problem with the ""health angle"" is that you can be healthy on pretty much any diet - meat included -  if you plan it well and eat healthy.  When you base your vegan argument on health, people will of course not take it as seriously, because they assume ""well, everyone indulges/cheats sometime on healthy diets, right?"", and when you don't, they'll think you're an extremist or have anorexia or something.  If you get it across to them that it could be the healthiest food on earth, but if it had animals, you won't eat it, that tends to make conversations like the one above quite a bit easier."
vegan,3ddv8w,anachronic,5,Wed Jul 15 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I first heard the idea of 'diet vegans' falling off the wagon a lot more than 'ethic vegans' in a video by Vegan Gains. I think what he said, basically 'you cant cheat on ethics', is resonating with what you are saying and is something I should consider in the future, on how I handle myself.  Veganism came at the same time I decided I wanted to start eating healthier, gain some weight and exercise more. It is a lot of changes all at once, and I attribute those choices to each other. I think this is why I wanted to really push the health stand in the forefront.  Thinking about it now, for coworkers asking (out of curiosity) it is easier to say 'I dont eat animals because I love them.' than 'animal fat and cholesterol contributes to the leading cause of death in america'."
vegan,3ddv8w,anachronic,3,Wed Jul 15 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"Or just say ""I don't eat animals"", period.  If they want to know why, they can ask... then you can say you don't like the way they're treated.  FYI - my 0.02 is that saying stuff like ""...because I love them"" can sometimes backfire, because people get really defensive and think you're implying that they don't love animals (which of course they think they do)... and that can lead some people to get pretty aggressive and rude."

vegan,3ddv8w,misskinky,2,Wed Jul 15 15:08:22 2015 UTC,"My friend did a pretty good video on the subject, complete with references in the video, so have a look at that.  From my understanding, in someone who eats no dietary cholesterol and begins eating dietary cholesterol, cholesterol levels go up. But in people who are already eating animal products regularly and then eat a bit more, their cholesterol levels aren't impacted significantly. This is what the recent dietary guidelines that came out was getting at when they removed the advice to reduce cholesterol intake. The majority of people are already eating animal products, so eating a little bit less isn't really changing their cholesterol levels. Of course, if they stopped eating animal products entirely, they'd most likely see their cholesterol levels drop.   You'll see vegans here post their blood work from time to time. Our numbers tend to be very low. These were mine, after being vegan for 6 years."

My combined and bad cholesterol levels are both below the expected range (and that's a very good thing). But this leads us to the reason why you're having so much trouble finding those studies about dietary cholesterol. One could point to the fact that my diet consists largely of whole foods and that I am relatively active. Unfortunately there are not many studies done on diet that control for people's levels of eating whole foods, getting exercise, having money, smoking or not smoking, drinking alcohol, etc. This leads us to where we are - basically a person telling you dietary cholesterol is good, harmful, or neither to your health is more of an opinion at this point than anything else. What we do know is that elevated serum cholesterol is a very bad thing."

The study was implying that eating cholesterol kept your cholesterol in check.   No no. It's the exact opposite. When you don't eat cholesterol, your body makes plenty for you. Your body will not naturally produce too much. If you eat cholesterol on top of producing cholesterol, those enzymes will slow down but not stop, and it's way easier to over-eat cholesterol.  Long story short: you absolutely don't need to eat any cholesterol and there is much convincing evidence saying it's better not to.  https://www.drfuhrman.com/library/lower_cholesterol.aspx  Plus, ""good"" cholesterol is mostly important because it removes ""bad"" cholesterol. If there's no/low bad cholesterol, it's not important to have super high good cholesterol. Your body will make plenty."

Going vegan,  and being a daily advocate for veganism in your daily life,  is one of the most effective ways to do this.   The more normalized veganism is,  the more unnecessary animal exploitation appears.  This makes it easier for more people to realize it is immoral.

In fact, I think you misunderstand what morality is. The concept of morality, abstractly, is that there is objective good or evil in an act regardless of the consequences of the act. What you are describing is utilitarianism, however, I think the attendant economics of your argument are also incorrect. Individuals can make a difference just through their behavior - in a small town, how many vegans does it take to support a small vegan restaurant and allow it to operate, or to make it cost effective for a grocery store to stock soy milk? Once that restaurant is open, or soy milk is available, it decreases the opportunity cost of going vegan for everyone."

So it would not make sense to push for a law to ban animal slaughter until the majority was already vegan. And no I don't think we should go to war over it. This is a problem of how our society views nonhuman animals socially and legally. We treat them as things, as our property. So ideally what the law would do, when our society achieves this shift in consciousness, is to abolish the institution of animal property. We would have to stop breeding animals for human use, including those bred for food, clothing, entertainment, service, scientific research, pets, or any other purpose. So we will solve the problem of cows who need to be milked by not impregnating or allowing them to get pregnant. We will solve the problem of sheep who need to be shorn by not breeding more. And so on.  But even without an implementation strategy, nobody is excused from going vegan right now. The plain fact is that using animals instrumentally is a serious moral problem and we can't justify our participation in it. Whatever the outcome of people going vegan en masse, it will be much preferable to continuing to exploit almost 60 billion land animals and one trillion fish yearly."
vegan,3dhqpq,andjok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"First, what makes some animals ""clearly"" less valuable than others? What does that even mean?  Second, no we would not necessarily have to ""punish"" crimes against nonhuman animals similar to how we punish crimes against humans. Hopefully when we are at that point in social progress, we will have a justice system that focuses on rehabilitating those who harm society instead of punishing them. The best method of rehab for those who harm nonhuman animals may not be the same as for those who harm humans in a similar way. Also, a major factor in why we lock up people for harming humans is that it makes us feel safer that those who do harm are separated from society and it can give the victim a sense of closure, and that does not apply to nonhumans."

vegan,3dhqpq,Life-in-Death,2,Thu Jul 16 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"What would be the most realistic possible goal for the vegan community to attempt to legally implement on the entire planet?   To spend decades or centuries encouraging others to become vegan until a paradigm shift is achevied. At a certain point, it would be socially unacceptable to harm (or pay someone else to harm) nonhuman animals simply for food/clothing/etc. Only once that point is reached can we have serious national or worldwide discussions on the legality of harming animals.  All your concerns about wasting milk or letting animals die are unfounded, as the supply would decrease as the demand decreased.   I am not vegan or vegetarian, I completely agree with the idea of banning factory farms from operating, but I teeter just on the edge of falling into only going as far as eating snakes/fish/insects clung by the idea of how complicated it would be to implement the extinction of animals domesticated for the purpose of slaughter and consumption of meat, and the fact that it's already on the shelves and me stopping would be less effective to the cause of morality than not littering in a world where only wimps owned trashcans.   I feel like I should address this, but I don’t really follow. What is your main point here?   At what point would you consider a level of consciousness immoral to consume?   The ability to experience suffering.   And finally, in a situation where more than half of the world was in support of full veganism and a good portion supported waging war against the territories/nations and people who have not taken up to the cause and continued the allowing of farms under the protection of their government, would you support this war?   Interesting question. I suppose I would support this war, but I don’t know if it would need to be a war of weapons. A war of ideas would likely be more effective. For example, we don’t go around waging war against countries that systematically subjugate women, but organizations exist to promote educating women in these countries."

vegan,3dcgrd,Zombiefishfood,3,Wed Jul 15 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"I know seaweed are algae, and algae can reproduce both sexually and asexually, so.... sperm and egg is one option, similar to plants.

Probably budding/cloning is the best method if it's a strain that you want to preserve."

The researchers are saying this strain of dulse, not all dulse, tastes like bacon. Strains can be very different from one another despite their relatedness.

Fair point, but they all still have similar flavors and similar nutritional content... low fat, high fiber, crunchy, vitamin C, etc...   That was my point about the Dulse mentioned.  Seaweed is pretty similar, even across different strains like Kombu, Nori, Hijiki, etc...    I don't see how they can take low-fat seaweed and get something that will mimic bacon, which is mostly fat.

vegan,3dfbum,friendlyelephant,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:54:18 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. I can't see how taking the eggs away negatively effects the hens. I see it as non verbal consent. If I saw they were distressed by my takings them, then I wouldn't, but they show no signs of distress. They get more than enough nutrients, and they get their shells back for calcium."
vegan,3dfbum,PumpkinMomma,3,Thu Jul 16 09:54:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If the hen doesn't mind whether or not you take the egg, then the hen is not worse off for you having taken it. For me, this means it's acceptable. However, for some people morality transcends the hen's desires, and it is simply immoral either way, regardless of how you or the hen feel, to exploit it.  Now often consent comes into play here, to explain why on this view rational adults can waive their rights and exploit each other, e.g. two professional wrestlers can beat each other up for money because they consent to it. Whereas you couldn't beat a hen up, even if it were in the hen's best interests, because the hen can't consent or waive its right to autonomy.   But this logic falls victim to practical circumstances. For instance, when an animal suffers to death, and the animal would rather be euthanized, if one were to kill the animal, on this system their action would be considered morally on par with murdering a non-consenting person, since, as the animal cannot waive its right to autonomy, you're violating it fully. Here it seems to me that in euthanizing the animal we are not doing anything morally blameworthy, and that the interests of the animal should count. It seems to me that morality should not transcend the animal's desires.  One way to modify for this is to imagine a purely rational agent representing the animal's interests, and allow this agent to consent for that animal. This also would justify our disciplining of children and infants that also can't consent, without causing egregious rights violations, (by not letting them leave the house for example..) so it's a multi-faceted solution. On this view you could strike up a theoretical contract with your hens, that you feed them and give them a place to stay, and they give you their eggs. According to this last system, you eating their eggs is completely morally acceptable, and it seems to be the closest to what I think you're going for."
vegan,3dfbum,chessguy44,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. A VERY interesting point.   Another consent example is my mum's job, she cared for people with severe learning disabilities, which included people who could not walk or talk. She cared for these adults, tube feeding, washing and dressing and such. These patients could not give their consent to be looked after, but it is clearly not a bad thing to assume this. It's a really interesting debate.  FYI my hens had toast and blueberries for breakfast. I'm gonna assume they are happy with their contract!"
