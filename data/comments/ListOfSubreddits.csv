ListOfSubreddits,3bplc6,IranianGenius,2,Wed Jul 1 03:14:24 2015 UTC,List of users by karma... but you'd have to update it frequently.
ListOfSubreddits,3bplc6,ZadocPaet,0,Fri Jul 3 05:42:35 2015 UTC,I don't think I'll do that one. Are any of the sites up to date?
ListOfSubreddits,3bayi3,Cynical_Teenager,3,Sat Jun 27 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping that this subreddit helps me and others to restore their interest in reddit with new, quality subs."
ListOfSubreddits,3bayi3,IranianGenius,3,Sat Jun 27 17:44:47 2015 UTC,I hope so! Let me know if you have ideas of lists you'd like to see!
ListOfSubreddits,3bayi3,rasterbee,2,Sat Jun 27 19:24:32 2015 UTC,What the fuck  IG who did you bribe

ListOfSubreddits,3bayi3,OneRedSent,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:46:32 2015 UTC,This is so meta!
ListOfSubreddits,3bbdt4,Minime0601,6,Sat Jun 27 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"Because many comments are asking if they can suggest subreddits to remove as defaults, the answer is YES. Please and thank you!"

ListOfSubreddits,3aaou0,IranianGenius,2,Thu Jun 18 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"Speaking of new lists, I had an idea for one. A list of Subreddit Networks.   Examples that I can think off:   SFW Porn Network  Imaginary Network NationalPhotoSubs Network  Retro Gaming Network  Shitty Network    I am sure there are more!"
ListOfSubreddits,3aaou0,ZadocPaet,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:56:38 2015 UTC,Those are the only ones I could find. I can make a list of just those I guess?
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,IranianGenius,6,Wed Jun 10 23:06:47 2015 UTC,There's a list already gathered in SRD here. Also lots of them listed in /r/redditrequest by people trying to get them unbanned.  I have a feeling this will be a very long list.
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,roastedlasagna,4,Thu Jun 11 05:35:30 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely not going to list every single ""fatpeoplex"" sub but I'll probably get at least a few of them. Or maybe a whole new list just for that lol..."
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,roastedlasagna,3,Thu Jun 11 05:37:13 2015 UTC,"Depends how long this goes on. With the rate new ones are popping up in /r/all/rising, you may need a full wiki page to cover them all. And I say that knowing how big the character limit is for wiki pages.  You could also create the list of Ellen Pao hate subreddits, there's a lot of those popping up as well. Also the parody subreddits (thinpeoplehate for example)."
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,roastedlasagna,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:47:57 2015 UTC,omg. I wish this happened another week so I could get to it all :P
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,roastedlasagna,2,Thu Jun 11 05:48:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. I've been super busy this past week. If you want some help, I'll have some time this weekend. But unfortunately to get them all it requires constant attention, which I can't do."
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,JustCallMeEro,2,Thu Jun 11 05:52:15 2015 UTC,"Well, luckily someone else was paying attention! Here's a comprehensive recap from SRD; it includes almost all of the banned subreddits. I'm sure there's more (/r/redditrequest probably would be a good place to look for them), but this seems like the best list.  Ninja edit: Even less work for you thanks to this comment :)"
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,_NiggyStardust_,3,Mon Jun 15 06:38:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this had anything to do with what happened, but I noticed that /r/CheapStuffOnAmazon is banned."
ListOfSubreddits,39d173,xRaw-HD,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"So far it's been /r/fatpeoplehate, /r/hamplanethatred, /r/transfags /r/neofag and /r/shitniggerssay."

ListOfSubreddits,2z7fkz,Thirtyfourfiftyfive,3,Mon Mar 16 05:54:27 2015 UTC,I think that a voting form would be the best choice for this.
ListOfSubreddits,2z7fkz,Thirtyfourfiftyfive,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"Alright. The biggest issue about this is that if people are voting, it means I have to give them a list of subs to choose from. I'll still do it though :)"
ListOfSubreddits,2xoipd,Uthrar,2,Mon Mar 2 16:27:13 2015 UTC,Could you add South America and put /r/Brazil and /r/Brasil on the list?
ListOfSubreddits,2xoipd,Uthrar,2,Tue Mar 3 11:44:17 2015 UTC,"/r/Brazil is relatively small, but I'm adding /r/Brasil. :)"
ListOfSubreddits,2xb88c,IranianGenius,3,Fri Feb 27 03:12:32 2015 UTC,These lists are amazing. And now I feel like I added something to it too with the /r/askcarsales suggestion.
ListOfSubreddits,2xb88c,AllDaveAllDay,2,Fri Feb 27 04:11:49 2015 UTC,Thanks! I feel like you added something too!
ListOfSubreddits,2xb88c,WalderC,2,Fri Feb 27 04:17:58 2015 UTC,I know this is an old thread but I am new to this subreddit and when I saw this list of Advice subs I was compelled to share a link to a multi-reddit I started awhile back called AskingOthersAgain...  And I also was working on a couple of other multis which might have a few different ones included (although there is a lot of overlap...) - MyAskAnything or Advice
ListOfSubreddits,2xb88c,VoltMate,0,Sun Jun 28 02:18:16 2015 UTC,These links go nowhere for me? Thanks so much for your suggestions though.
ListOfSubreddits,2x33ie,IranianGenius,2,Wed Feb 25 06:13:48 2015 UTC,"I recently discovered /r/askcarsales, which is phenomenal. You could probably make an advice subcategory for financial decisions."
ListOfSubreddits,2x33ie,AllDaveAllDay,2,Wed Feb 25 14:45:02 2015 UTC,"Great suggestion! I added that here and I put a link in the advice wiki here.  I might make a whole wiki for financial decisions, but I'm trying to find a good place to start because of all the bitcoin dogecoin litecoin whatevercoin drama that it might start if I forget one. I want to try to be fair and unbiased (except sometimes promoting subreddits I moderate ;) )."

ListOfSubreddits,2wmepe,petiskacang,1 point,Fri May 22 15:06:06 2015 UTC,Good addition!  Probably banned for spam. That's why most of these are banned.
ListOfSubreddits,2wmepe,J4wer,2,Fri May 22 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"lol so i guess i listed any privates/banneds here, edit when needed privates /r/dot /r/dots /r/unilever /r/aqua /r/sanic banneds /r/washingmachine"

ListOfSubreddits,2vtth2,IranianGenius,2,Sat Feb 14 01:05:11 2015 UTC,"I PMed you about this list, and you asked me to comment so you could check it later. So here it is:   I was looking at your sub /r/ListOfSubreddits, and I thought that a sub I'm part of, /r/TellMeAFact, might be appropriate as an alternative to /r/TodayILearned. I figured you'd want any additions to the list if possible, and obviously it increases the awareness of our sub too :)  Of course the format is a bit different to /r/TodayILearned, so I understand if you don't want to add us to that list. Having said that, have you considered a new list for fact-based subs? There's a heck of a lot of them from what I've noticed.  Anyway, thanks in advance!"

ListOfSubreddits,2v99i9,Suppafly,2,Mon Feb 9 05:08:24 2015 UTC,I'd say go to /r/NSFW411. It's on the main list. I don't know enough about NSFW subs to add them to the list myself.
