They are privately owned, on contract to a specific brand. From my understanding Tesla's stores mostly have no mechanics bay and in fact some are in a small mall store with no models in stock to sell directly or provide test drives. You can get a test drive and buy a car from these stores but you won't be looking at a specific car and taking that one for a test drive. This may not be the case for all the tesla dealerships. But that is the model as I understand Tesla's way of selling. It is completely different then the old way ""Toyota"" does it. So much so in fact the old school dealerships are trying their hardest to make it illegal for Tesla's to sell in some states.  No everyone doesn't need to drive the same car. Or have the same experience. And it is pretty foolish to believe the sales of cars would resemble in anyway the phone market. An electric car would be 90% electronics and software. Sounds exactly like an apple device to me. And if apple has proven anything. When they hit an industry hard. Everyone follows. Imitates. And the industry as a whole explodes in verity and choices. There is no reason Apple would not belong in any industry they set their minds too. Just like Samsung is into EVERYTHING. As long as Apple focuses on the product at hand instead of mass production of available choices like others do. They will likely succeed. A flying taxi would be awesome. But it's a whole different topic. And I would like to see where you get you opinion on Elon and Space X from? I think he's doing a better job getting shit done then anyone else including nasa with all their budgets and bureaucratic hoops they need to jump through. And PayPal hasn't had anything to do with Elon for 10 years... It was massive when he sold it and what happened from there has nothing to do with him..."

apple,3e03sw,flashcats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:56 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about what companies do, then no... Google isn't primarily an advertising company, it's a web/software company. If you were to look at the size of the product and engineering teams for Android, Chrome, Search/Knowledge Graph, Maps, Gmail/Inbox, Photos, etc. I think you'd find that they far outweigh efforts spent in Advertising.   I also disagree that Search is just a vehicle for advertising. Do you think Larry and Sergei were sitting in their garage thinking up a way to present advertising? Their core mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and searchable. Every development we've seen with the knowledge graph, autosuggest, and presenting contextual information shows that they focus a hell of a lot more on providing information first, and advertising second. I highly doubt the talented engineers that Google employs get up in the morning and go to work excited to work on an advertising vehicle, they're trying to provide the best way to answer any and all kinds of questions. Ads pay the bills, the magic is in the technology."
apple,3e03sw,nodevon,4,Tue Jul 21 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"Their financial statements disagree with you.  Google's revenue from advertising is about 90% of their total revenue.

apple,3e03sw,flashcats,7,Tue Jul 21 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think you're deliberately misrepresenting my point. I know advertising makes up the majority of their revenue. But in terms of what the company does on a day to day basis, then no - the majority of it isn't advertising. Do you think that the Android team gives a shit about advertising, or do you think they're just trying to make a good OS?   The number of hires and effort spent in an vertical, in my opinion, is a much better representation of what a company ""does"" than their revenue breakdowns.   I think it's a lot more important than you're making out to acknowledge the motivations of the people who work for a company in placing a blanket statement on what they do."
apple,3e03sw,nodevon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"In that case, you're misrepresenting MY POINT.  My point is the Google's core business is advertising and I'm not going to budge. They do cool shit too. But they are, at their core, an advertising company.  If you want to have a conversation about the ""motivations"" of their employees, cool, but that's not what I'm saying.  BTW, I think some of this disconnect stems from you not knowing what ""core business"" means.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_business   The core business of an organization is an idealized construct intended to express that organization's ""main"" or ""essential"" activity.   Google's main/essential activity is advertising. Pretty much every product loops back into advertising dollars. You don't wake up every day and think, ""How can I give Google more advertising revenue?"", but by adding features to Android, which leads to more people using it, that DIRECTLY leads to more advertising dollars.  Google doesn't give away Android because Google is nice. They do it because they have a vested interest in people using it so they get more advertising dollars."
apple,3e03sw,flashcats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:55:11 2015 UTC,"You started off talking about where Google's expertise lies, because of how Google and Apple are good at different things. I assumed you were using core business in a different sense, because just because Google makes it's money from advertising doesn't necessarily mean that that's where it's employees skills lie. Google's competitive advantage is in web and software. Not advertising. Anyone can make an ad product - Facebook, Apple, and amazon have done that, but Google makes the most money from advertising because its core products are the best.   The most appropriate assumption for the point of this thread is that it was about which company's expertise best aligned it to creating a compelling car product. Google's advertising business model has nothing to do with why they're going to make waves with their car product - their expertise in software and web engineering certainly does."

apple,3e03sw,nodevon,-4,Tue Jul 21 03:11:43 2015 UTC,Not so much assuming the worst about you (though a Google employee posting in /r/apple is a wonderfully cliche idea).

apple,3e03sw,crypticgeek,4,Tue Jul 21 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"Apple in my opinion is much more focused than Google. Although everyone is equally familiar with Apple as they are Google, Apple's every move is watched and scrutinized by any popular media. Google on the other hand is so broad and so massive that they can publicly work on and announce new, crazy projects and people don't instantly hop on board and see that as the next product they're going to buy.

apple,3e03sw,TheVloginator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:33 2015 UTC,Apple building its own electric car from the ground up is a huge multi-billion dollar risk. Particularly since Tesla has done such an outstanding job staking a claim to the high end (read profitable) of the electric car market. Hopefully what's happening is that Apple is working on the infotainment and self-driving portion of the equation while partnering with Tesla on the actual vehicle.
apple,3e03sw,HICSF,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"One thing it has taken Tesla a really long time to get right is manufacturing, they struggled with that for years and some might say it wasn't until the Toyota partnership did they really figure out how to build at scale. Apple does that well, or at least manages their supply chain very well, which is a huge part of auto manufacturing."
apple,3e03sw,bonestamp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:06:28 2015 UTC,"Cars are different from gadgets/devices though. Tesla is doing great things with their cars and they certainly deserve to be the top choice right now. But look at ALL of the electric cars on the road. Most common car companies have an electric model. They all are competing with each other and always will because people like different cars for different reasons. When you look at smartphones, sure there are plenty of options. But there are a few that are a majority. With cars, there's hundreds of options and with it being a much more expensive investment, people are going to be more picky about what they want. With phones/tablets/etc. it's relatively easy to swap if you don't like what you just purchased. With cars, it's a whole lot harder. If Apple goes the way of Tesla, I think that's the only optional path. Tesla is the only company making an electric car, that's sporty, not ugly looking and relatively affordable. Apple would be smart to go that route because their only ""competition"" is Tesla. So there is plenty of room to break into the sporty electric consumer car space."

apple,3e2mqf,greatcaffeine,7,Tue Jul 21 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"Here’s my British perspective:  Beats 1 has incredible competition within the United Kingdom, and though they’ve managed to acquire some incredible talent, they’re still up against the juggernaut that is BBC Radio 1, which primarily succeeds because it broadcasts on FM and DAB frequencies to people in their car or builders at work, whilst Beats 1 requires a data connection which eats up peoples already small data allowances, battery life and is subject to spotty reception.  This is secondary to the fact that Apple is now competing with themselves. The iPod allowed people to become their own DJ’s rather than relying on whatever radio station was nearby for their personal walkman’s to tune into. And people are more likely than ever are going to be more inclined to use their own selection of music over other people’s, and even then, I’d recommend Spotify for their playlists curation rather than Apple.  I can see Beats 1 being a moderate success due to the money being thrown at it and the talent behind it but there’s so much innovation it needs to do from where it is right now to where it can be. Being the first ever global radio station is ambitious, but geographical stations has better advantages and iPod’s existence makes this a difficult process going forward.  Beat 1 is primarily going to rely on Apple Music being a success, but I think Spotify got a huge head start that has seen integration with corporations like the BBC that gives a really good recipe for success. This isn’t going to be a quick fight, this really will be a long slog."

I would love to listen to Julie and Ebro's shows, but their timings are pretty inconvenient for me (Ebro's is 11pm-1am or 11am-1pm, who is that convenient for?).  I've loved Beats 1 from the very first broadcast, but one of the problems with running a global station is that show times are super inconvenient a lot of the time :("

If you have only listened to the daytime shows and decided you don't like them I would urge you to check out some of the weekly shows St Vincent, OtherTone, Josh Homme, Q-tip, Soulection, Elton John, A-Trak, One Mix, etc. Unless you listen to only classical, country or metal there should be one of those shows you should enjoy."

The task switcher is really just a list of your most recently used apps, regardless of status. What you're seeing are PNG screenshots of when you last looked at the app. The system is much smarter than you at managing resources, so let it do its job. Whatever task you're trying to do always has highest priority and the system will automatically dedicate everything it can to that. If there are some extra resources available that aren't being used, it can keep your last few apps paused so that you can switch to them faster, but as soon as you need the RAM (say to play a game) those other apps will be instantly and mercilessly purged from memory. Unused RAM is wasted RAM. Completely restarting an app that could have been pulled from RAM uses more power and time. You're also wasting time (with the battery-sucking screen on) every time you manually ""quit"" these apps. The sooner you turn your screen off, the sooner you actually start saving system resources. Just disable background refresh on Facebook (or uninstall it) and you're probably good to go."

Instead of properly backgrounding the app, which uses no resources and resumes with little processing effort, you're forcing the app to shutdown, which will make it flush its state and do a full reload when its brought back.  Every app has a set of interfaces where the system can send them messages about what state they're in. When an app goes off the screen, the app receives enough information from the system to intelligently do what you're doing manually, and apps are much better at it than your thumb is.  You're basically putting your phone back in the iOS 3 era (or whatever version was the one before backgrounding). The only reason to swipe up is if you suspect an app is doing something wrong.

Frozen. Not using processor cycles and using very little if any memory. And the phone is aware of what it needs. If it needs memory, it simply takes it and moves anything it needs to out of queue. The phone knows how to prioritize things and manage it's resources for the best performance without any intervention from the user.

My 32gb iphone 5S can hold several safari pages with all apps just fine.   But damned if I don't turn off as many things as possible, the iPad mini just refreshes almost every single time I switch pages in safari !  I used to have a app on the original iPhone that could clear RAM , specifically because I need to hold safari pages open with out refreshing.

apple,3dzvtw,spinwizard69,-9,Tue Jul 21 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"You absolutely should not do this.    You should absolutely not take this advice!    In normal circumstances you won't have a problem but you need to realize that some apps don't play nice with iOS.  Applying a little intelligence to app management can prevent or eliminate problems.      They're mostly already completely closed. The task switcher is really just a list of your most recently used apps, regardless of status. What you're seeing are PNG screenshots of when you last looked at the app.    This is mostly true but some apps keep threads of operation going in background, including apps from big social networking companies.   Some of these apps are notorious for causing problems.    It should be noted that the majority of apps don't do this and play nice with iOS but you can't assume all apps go into background freeing up all resources.      The system is much smarter than you at managing resources, so let it do its job. Whatever task you're trying to do always has highest priority and the system will automatically dedicate everything it can to that. If there are some extra resources available that aren't being used, it can keep your last few apps paused so that you can switch to them faster, but as soon as you need the RAM (say to play a game) those other apps will be instantly and mercilessly purged from memory.    This is generally true but do realize that resources are resources and recovering those resources takes time.       Unused RAM is wasted RAM.    This is most certainly true but it is also true that most iOS devices do not have enough RAM to really run properly.   This even with Apple supplied software like Safari.   At times doing everything you can to free up resources is the smart thing to do.    It is the lack of RAM that has me at odds with your recommendations, one only has to pick up an iPad Air 2 and realize that RAM on that device makes a huge difference in performance.   This especially in RAM hungry apps.      Completely restarting an app that could have been pulled from RAM uses more power and time.    Most certainly but that doesn't really matter if the app you wanted to run previously need the RAM.      You're also wasting time (with the battery-sucking screen on) every time you manually ""quit"" these apps. The sooner you turn your screen off, the sooner you actually start saving system resources.    Considering most of the power used by these devices is in the screen back light that is rather obvious.   You don't need to manually quite apps, sometimes though you have to deal with those apps if you have a particularly demanding app to be ran.       Just disable background refresh on Facebook (or uninstall it) and you're probably good to go.    So at least you realize that there are indeed troubling apps out there that do cause problems.   Here is the thing though, your suggestion doesn't make sense if the background refresh is something the user normally wants.    It makes far more sense to stop the apps when you know you need the system resources.    The whole problem I have with your post is that you speak in terms of absolutes ( incorrectly I might add) when there is community knowledge that some apps do cause problems.    In general you don't need to be stopping apps but sometimes it solves problem.    In many cases, when helping users with problems, I've seen cleaning up these apps instantly solve problems on a users iOS device.   It is the first thing I do if somebody asks me about problems they are having with their iOS device."

apple,3dzvtw,piltdownman7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:02 2015 UTC,Actually if the user force quits (swipe up) state restoration from the app is wiped. This is a safety mechanism to prevent the app from getting stuck in a bad state. That said this was broken on Apples end from iOS 7 until they fixed it in 8.3. So if you swiped in say 8.2 it wouldn't be wiped from memory.

The problem is closing out suspended apps is a good way to manage your iOS device if you understand how it works and what apps do what.  Plus there is the reality that doing so can in many cases correct an iOS device that has obvious performance issues.     If an app uses your location, it will show the location badge in the top of the screen. If there are apps that you don't want to allow them to access your location, iOS gives you the tools to turn that off. Same with apps that use background refresh. iOS lets you turn that off.   Yes but going into settings to toggle a feature like background refresh off is more time consuming than simply closing out the app.   It is often surprising to find out how many apps are background refresh capable, some a user may never want to refresh in background which means they can be shut off.   Many other apps the user might benefit from background refresh from time to time, with these apps it makes sense to exit out of them when you are completely finished with them.    My big problem here again is that people speak in absolutes when the data is pretty clear, closing out apps can correct problems on iOS devices.  Should it be done normally for every app used - no - but sometimes you just have to take system management into your own hands."
apple,3dzvtw,yourmomsvoicemail,5,Tue Jul 21 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"The problem is closing out suspended apps is a good way to manage your iOS device if you understand how it works and what apps do what.   No, this is not correct. Your iOS is way better at managing its own resources. The only exception I could think of would be if you have your device plugged into your Mac and are running Instruments so you can actually see the data your device sees. Unless you're doing that your device understands its needs better than you do.   Many other apps the user might benefit from background refresh from time to time, with these apps it makes sense to exit out of them when you are completely finished with them.   This is a misunderstanding of background refresh. iOS learns your habits and intelligently background refreshes the app based on how frequently you use the app, when it would use the least amount of battery, and what times of day you use the app. If there's an app that you use once in a blue moon, then it will not background refresh. The frequency of the background refresh corresponds with how often you use the app.  Force closing apps only disrupts iOS's ability to intelligently run background refresh. So by force closing apps, you are hindering its ability to manage your resources.   closing out apps can correct problems on iOS devices.   What issues can it correct? Just like in OS X, force-closing apps is rarely needed. Regularly force-closing apps (especially in mass) is not necessary, and there are no problems that can be fixed by it.  tl;dr You👏 are👏 not👏 better👏 at👏 managing👏 resources👏 than👏 iOS.👏"

But they will do it even if you swipe it up from your multitask list. There is an option in settings called ""Background refresh"".  But I wouldn't recommend disabling it unless you desperately need a few more minutes of battery. Apple cares a lot about battery life. So apps can't just refresh their content whenever they want. Also, when the iPhone gives an app permission to refresh on the background, it gives them exactly 30 seconds to do all they need. It the task isn't done in 30 seconds, the process is killed and the refresh is aborted."

I try to keep other apps that I use once a week or less closed just so they aren't cluttering up my convenient app switcher, but technically I'm not doing any resource management. If I use an app once a week, it would be closed by the system before I next used it anyways.   People who obsessively close every app to get a ""clean slate"" are not benefitting themselves in any way. No benefit of a quick app switcher, wasting battery by having to load apps from scratch with every use, and aggressively managing the RAM when the system would've done it for them, so it's a waste of time.   But I'm a fan of keeping it clean and organized to be useful. 10-20 apps that you use regularly.   Most people in this thread would argue that you should just leave like 60 apps continuously in the switcher. That just makes it useless to me.

I'm not sure how a reasonable person can even argue with this particular point, background refresh by it's very nature uses battery power.   How much power depends upon the app and the refresh taking place.   Background refresh can be very useful though so disabling it isn't always the best practice, it makes far more sense to close the apps known to be a problem when you the user doesn't need the capability anymore.    Likewise you can turn off refresh for apps you never want to update in background.     What this comes down to is the user managing his device to get the best performance for his particular needs.

Here are the multitasking guidelines for example: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Multitasking.html  iOS is much much smarter about resources than the user, especially since it knows exactly what is going on in the phone. There are cases in which apps can remain in background and use power, but they are limited. For example, only one app can do turn by turn navigation, play music, etc. So the battery impact will be negligible if all other apps are left ""in the background""."

apple,3dzvtw,RedditV4,8,Mon Jul 20 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"The only situation in which it would make sense to use a ""memory cleaner"" is if you're doing some work on large live data sets (ie, many audio/video feeds) where an interruption could be fatal. As such you won't be switching to other programs for the duration.  Understand what a ""memory cleaner"" does though. It tries to fill all physically available memory, thusly pushing any other content out. This means purging in-memory disk caches, paging programs to disk. When those chunks of data are needed again they'll have to be loaded back in from disk, reducing performance.  Don't try to micro-manage a self-managing system, you'll just get in the way."

OS X isn't quite as merciless as iOS when it comes to managing your resources, but it's gotten a lot closer with features such as App Nap. At any rate, the relevant issue here is that you do not want free RAM. Any free RAM is wasted RAM that could be doing something useful for you. An app that purges RAM is just slowing your computer down. If something else needs those resources, the OS will reallocate properly. If you really are short on resources and things are sluggish, the solution is to quit certain apps, not let a poorly-designed app haphazardly purge the wrong bits of RAM."

Doing so has an adverse effect on battery life, as the system and individual apps do a great deal of work to manage power and performance on our behalf.  This is especially true if you frequently dismiss and re–open the same app over and over. The system expands resources both for launching and terminating it each time, and that adds considerably to the overhead of using the app. Leaving them in the app switcher allows the system to place it in a suspended state in which it does not consume system resources and is inexpensive to bring to the foreground again."

apple,3dzvtw,adse_,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"There's no ""universal answer"" to this question. Anyone who claims an absolute Yes/No answer.. is .. well. just flat wrong.   Whether or not you need to ""Force Kill"" background Apps.. is going to depend a lot on a wide variety of factors:  1.) The specific combination of Apps you're frequently using. (and how WELL or NOT WELL those Apps were coded/written)  2.) The age/make/model of device (and more specifically - how much physical RAM it has)  3.) What version of iOS you're using.   There was a time back in the early days of iOS (such as iPhone1 or iPad1)... where the devices had such limited RAM,.. that force-killing certain resource-hungry or poorly written background Apps was advantageous. (using a Resource Monitor tool such as the App ""iStat"" -- you could absolutely 100% see empirical evidence that Force-Closing background Apps frees up memory). While iOS SHOULD do this automatically on it's own --- I've found over 5 or 6 years of different iOS devices (and upgrades to iOS itself).. that it doesn't really do a 100% perfect job juggling resources on it's own. iOS, much like any Operating System/computer,. needs to be fully rebooted once in a while to ""refresh"" things. I generally do a full shutdown-restart of my devices at least 1 time a week.   Newer devices, that have more RAM and improvements in iOS,.. all combine to dampen/lessen the memory-footprint/impact of Background Apps.. so you don't get as much improvement from force-closing them. You may still occasionally need to do it,. if an App becomes unresponsive or flaky,.. but in more normal cases, it's not necessary.   But you're not really risking any damage by doing it. iOS compartmentalizes (separates) the OS from App-code and from User-data,.. so those 3 things are all somewhat protected from each other. It's a pretty stable/solid system. You could ""force-close"" an App 100 times a day.. and probably be totally fine.

Actually, there are no background apps on the iphone. Some apps may leave a background ""task"" running, but that's it. And only in special cases defined by the current programming interface.  Overcast may leave a podcast running in the background, but it's just the ""play audio"" task that's running, not the entire app. Skype may leave a ""handle voip"" task running, but the Skype app is closed. Etc etc.  Apps like, I don't know, Drafts or Youtube or Pocket or 95% of most apps leave no task running in the background.  If you swipe an app from your list of recent apps, your iPhone will delete the cache that was there to make the app boot faster. And all you have achieved is to make the app take more time to load."

apple,3dzvtw,luchod,0,Tue Jul 21 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"The reason to close apps that are no longer needed is so they do not create problems with another app that you do nothing to have reload. Apps that are in the app switcher will reload if their RAM has been reallocated to another app/task. If you have a game open and want to check Facebook real quick then open safari without closing Facebook there's a good chance that the RAM that was allocated to that game will be reallocated and when you switch back to the game it will reload.   Third party apps on iOS are run in sandbox, people saying that it can corrupt your phone by closing them is pure rubbish. It's the same reason why you should close unused tabs on safari. Having an app or a tab on safari reload can cause more ""problems"" for the end user than the user swiping up to close the app.   The times that you don't want to close an app is when it needs to save data locally or submit something onto the Internet. If you close it before it can do that the obviously you will lose that data. And for god sakes, having all of the apps on the task switcher opened will reduce the frame rate of your phone while swiping across apps.   Also one last note. Closing apps will only negatively affect your battery life if you close an app when you wanted to open it again seconds later because the app has to have RAM allocated to it again and startup. But closing an app that has no purpose for the foreseeable future (5+ minutes) will have negligent  affect on battery life.  TLDR: if you don't close apps then you let iOS reallocate RAM as it sees, not as you may want it to. This will cause apps to reload when opening (even if you just wanted to view something real quick on Facebook then go back to that previous task)."
apple,3dzvtw,aquanext,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:56:21 2015 UTC,"I have been using iOS a long time and I do this routinely. In fact, obsessively, multiple times a day. I don't want a bunch of random shit sitting in my switcher. I only want relevant crap -- the one, two, or three things that are relevant to whatever I'm doing at any given time. Total hypothetical, but like if I'm reading something in Safari, and I want to post about it to Facebook, but maybe need to do whatever in some other app also in the middle of all of this... all I want to have in my switcher are those three apps. Nothing else.  I don't know if we/Apple need to have a chat about this, but I feel like being able to control what shit is in my switcher is kind of like... important. Way more than you might think. I need it this way to stay organized. I don't much care what the app does behind the scenes. But just like on my computer, I tend to keep relevant tasks going at any given time."

At least per what's been reported so far, none of these companies takes issue with the fact that Samsung has been ordered to pay Apple tons and tons of money. The issue is that the assessed damages are effectively the entire profit from the infringing devices. These companies argue that the damages should be relative to the harm caused. Under that model, even with penalties (e.g. forcing Samsung to pay a fair licensing fee plus treble damages for the infringement), the award would have been smaller. Agree or disagree with their argument, but this is not the broad stroke every headline has reported this as---everyone but Samsung agrees that Samsung should pay and pay big---but rather is just a question of how the court should calculate damages in certain patent infringement cases."

apple,3e1fgq,N7Brendan,9,Tue Jul 21 05:35:46 2015 UTC,"What made you originally pick Apple, and why have you stayed?   I picked up an iPod Touch 4th Generation for Christmas of 2010, or just before 9th Grade. All my friends had one, and we used to sit during our school lunch breaks and play CoD Zombies and other games with BlueTooth. About that time, I stopped using my DS (for obvious reasons). It eventually became my everything deice (I didn't have my own computer at the time).  At the same time, I had a SamSomething QWERTY phone, which I constantly forgot about, as I had no reason for it (Really only for my parents to call me). I somehow managed to convince my parents and managed to score a new iPhone 5 for Christmas of 2012. I was immediately blown away by the integration of it. It seamlessly transferred everything off my iPod, every app and setting was on my iPhone, it was like I never left my iPod.  I now own an iPad and a MacBook. I stay with Apple because, IMHO, the devices are the best all rounders on the market (Every Android seems to have some sort of achilles heel). Every experience I've had with AppleCare has been flawless, and I've never left a store disappointed.   I know the whole 'It just works' thing gets thrown around a lot, but it's honestly true. Sure, there's times when it doesn't do what it's supposed to, but they happen few and far between.    If there is anyone here who has used both the latest versions of Android and iOS, which do you prefer?   No comment   Do the phones get quite laggy after about 6 months to a year?   I still rock my 2012 iPhone 5, there's a stutter or two here and there, but it's usually a buttery smooth phone, even on the latest OS. It's more than adequate as a DD even now.

Got another year and a half out of that one before the monitor was dangling from the keyboard part by a wire. Total time: 3 years. Total cost: $2100.  Three years ago I bought a Macbook. It looks and performs like the day it came out of the box. Total time: 3 years and likely much more. Total cost: $2100.  Apple is cheaper than the competition, not more expensive."
apple,3e1fgq,MyPackage,3,Tue Jul 21 18:03:08 2015 UTC,"What made you originally pick Apple, and why have you stayed?   I go back and forth between phones. Right now I'm using a Moto X 2014, but I was using an iPhone 5s for 3 months before that. I use a macbook pro for my main computer and I have an iPad 2 and a 2nd gen Nexus 7.   If there is anyone here who has used both the latest versions of Android and iOS, which do you prefer?   I like Lollipop more than iOS 8. I think the design aesthetic looks much better, the notification system is miles better than iOS's, the share menu between apps is much better, Google Now is way better than Siri, I like not having a physical home button because it makes the phone much smaller, and you don't realize how awesome it is to be able to set default apps for things until you're on iOS.   The things that are nice about iOS 8: iMessage on my laptop, predictable battery life, 3rd party apps are usually higher quality and new ones are on iOS first, amazing camera, car integration with most cars made in the past few years.   Do the phones get quite laggy after about 6 months to a year?   They don't get slow like Android phones get slow, but you do get bugs especially after software updates. iOS 8 at release was more buggy than Lollipop at release and I wanted to throw my phone across the room a few times with all the stupid iMessage and keyboard bugs I was having. Apple fixed pretty much everything though and I'd say currently iOS 8.4 is more stable than Android 5.1.1.   Any other things you'd like to mention in attempt to sway me over to the fruit side.   Go for it. You'll never know which OS you truly prefer until you've lived with both for a while. iOS is great and iPhones are always some of the best phones on the market."
apple,3e1fgq,DeathKoil,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:14 2015 UTC,"What made you originally pick Apple, and why have you stayed?   My reasoning was that I got a work phone, and I could carry two phones or port my number to the Work plan and not have to pay my own bill. The catch? The work phone had to be an iPhone. So I switched to save myself 100 dollars a month. I've had the iPhone 6+ for 7 months.   If there is anyone here who has used both the latest versions of Android and iOS, which do you prefer?   I still have my Nexus 5, and use it around the house. My use case is that of a power user who browses a ton, sends a lot of text messages, sends a lot of emails, and ""shares"" pictures, documents, URLS, etc between apps. I prefer Lollipop to iOS 8.4 for several reasons:   I can set default apps. This isn't a big deal to some people, but I find it annoying to have to copy and paste things like URLs into my browser of choice every time I want to open one. The keyboards in Android are much faster to type on and feature rich than the stock iOS keyboard or the iOS version of the same keyboard on Android. I send a ton of texts and emails from my phone. Long press for numbers/special characters saves a ton of time. Plus SwiftKey on Android learns things like ""when I press between O and P on the keyboard, I always mean P"". This allows me to type far faster and more accurately in Android. Chromecast support is superior on Android. Google's Voice Search / Assistant is better than Siri for my use case (looking up store hours, looking up directions, looking up what time sporting events are televised and on what channel in my time zone, etc). Siri has better integration with the phone, and works better as a ""personal assistant"" if you use Apple's default apps for everything. I don't use the voice searching as a personal assistany though, hence my preference for Google's version. Android's Notification system is better and more informative. I don't remember the last time I used the notification shade in iOS. It's been months. I lived in it on Android though.  Android is far better at sharing information between apps. The iPhone 6 doesn't have enough RAM for me. I constantly switch between apps and share between apps and on the Nexus 5 I never had a problem with applications needing to reload after I left them for a few seconds to several minutes, but I do have this issue at times with the iPhone 6+.    Now, some things on the iPhone are superior to Android:   The permissions system is awesome. Touch ID is awesome. Visual Voicemail is awesome. I used Google Voice on my Nexus 5 to give me a similar experience, but iOS's method is built in and nicer. Camera is superior to the Nexus 5, though current flagship Android devices have Cameras on par with the iPhone 6.    Do the phones get quite laggy after about 6 months to a year?   My Nexus 5 is not laggy and I bought it day 1. My first Android phone did get laggy, which was the Motorola Atrix. The software on that phone was terrible though. Luckily Motorola dropped MotoBLUR in favor of a near stock experience since then. Good riddance. I almost swore off Android because of the Atrix.   Though I am a power user, I don't bog my device down with 100+ apps. I only have apps on my phones that I use often. For example, I don't need an ""amazon"" app when I can just hit their website. Other than the stock apps, I only have 15ish apps on my Nexus 5 and a similar number of 3rd party apps on my iPhone 6+. Neither phone has become ""laggy"" with age, and I don't factory reset my phones ever.    Any other things you'd like to mention in attempt to sway me over to the fruit side.   Which platform is right for you really depends on your use case. For my use case, Android is better. To answer this question honestly, I'd need more information on what you use your phone. Give me some information about your usage, and I can give you a set of pros and cons for each platform based on that."
apple,3e1fgq,smpx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"Went from old iPhone to 4 generations of Android and recently came to iPhone 6+. I still have a couple of Androids around but the iPhone is definitely my main daily driver now. Love it.   I came back because I was getting really tired of touchwiz. Things were constantly failing. There were problems everywhere. It would lag. It was a FANTASTIC device for the first 6 weeks, and then a mediocre device for the next 6 months. Also, I was really into customizing every little thing on my Android device... but then after a while realized I just wanted things to work, which wasn't happening. I like the customizability of Android. Changing out the defaults was great, because I really like using Waze for navigation. However, after going to iOS i realized I really don't miss the customization very much. Everything on iOS is very polished and it allows me to swap out SOME things like keyboard, it lets me use different image editors, and while I still use Waze, I'm now fully happy with stock iOS apps for everything else. Things feel... fluid. Nope. If you use a Mac, you'll love an iPhone. I have a Macbook and handoff/continuity is awesome."
apple,3e1fgq,lawnmower16,-1,Tue Jul 21 09:29:36 2015 UTC,"I was a total Android fanboy for a while, mostly because all of my friends praised it to no end. I liked the customization, the open-ness of the apps, and I liked that the file system wasn't locked down and was similar to a computer. After going through three different Android phones, which I always loved to death for about 2 months before they became so slow and bug-ridden I couldn't stand them, I decided to go with iPhone.  I had tried iOS before. I had an iPod Touch which I used for music and for a few apps unavailable to Android. I never thought that I would want my music device to be my phone. Phones have short battery lives, their storage space is padded with apps and phone features, and calls and notifications interrupt music. I never realized that all these things were only slightly true at best.  I would never go back to Android for these reasons:   Music. I have plenty of gripes with the way iTunes and iOS music works, but no Android music ecosystem can hold a candle to the robust, carefully honed experience that is found on a genuine Apple product. Trust me, I have looked. Control center. All the features and settings I need are just a swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Flashlight, Calculator, Timer, Camera, Music, Screen Lock, Wireless controls... In Android, Flashlight was always a third-party neckbeardware app, certainly not integrated with the system and usually quite buggy. Or perhaps the special manufacturer-pre-installed OS-crippling skin had a flashlight feature built in. The same applied to many/most of these other features, such as music and timer. With iOS, everything is cleaner and more accessible. The built-in features are not only adequate, but just about perfect, and designed to run alongside the OS very smoothly. Apps. Android Apps in general are buggy. They are slow. They are prone to memory leaks and crashes. The truth is that most of the best app developers develop for iOS first and foremost, and it really shows. For just about any good app in the Google Play store, there is an app twice as well-designed, twice as user-friendly, and twice as efficient. My favorite examples are pretty obscure: Midori, a Japanese-English dictionary, and Galileo, an offline-capable vector-based map application. I was never able to find Android apps to match up to those, even back in the days when I was rocking the Android phone / iOS iPod combination.  And, like I mentioned in point #2, a large handful of apps I had on Android are rendered completely unnecessary by iOS. It saves lots of space and memory. Everything just works. I know this is a typical Apple fanboy thing to say, but take location services for instance. Perhaps this has changed in recent iterations of Android (I wouldn't know because Android phones seem to stup supporting updates to Android after a year or so), but with iOS, GPS is only on when you have an app open that needs it. And you get to go into the settings and choose which apps get to use which features. You can turn off GPS for all apps except Google Maps. You can turn off mobile data to apps like Youtube, so you don't have to worry about using too much data when you don't realize you aren't connected to wifi. You don't have to go into the settings or play with widgets constantly to maintain battery life. iPhone knows what to do, and when it doesn't, you can tell it what to do.   I could probably go on and on, but I couldn't recommend switching more. Apple makes the best mobile devices, hands down. They are sleekly designed, they don't feel like toys, and most importantly, the user experience is unparallelled. ""Apple tax?"" more like ""Quality tax."" I'll gladly shell out hundreds of dollars more for an iPhone. It's like full-sized kitchen oven vs Easy-Bake Oven."
apple,3e1fgq,EpicFlyingCat,5,Tue Jul 21 10:43:10 2015 UTC,"You clearly haven't used Android for quite a while... Apps are much better (except a few), Google's music service is so good I use it on iOS and things like permissions for apps are coming with Android M in the fall.   Both OS' are great imo and each have pros and cons. Android Lollipop was such a huge update to Android, you just can't assume it's the same unstable experience as a few years ago it was."

apple,3e1fgq,PolyethyleneAirbag,3,Tue Jul 21 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm Android apps aren't buggy or slow? Some are if you use the shitty ones, but overall they're quite good. I've jumped back and forth between a Nexus 6 and an iPhone 6+ and in all honesty I've had more app crashes on the iPhone than I ever had on the Nexus.   As for control center, Android has all this accessible from the swipe down menu as well.   Music? I'm really not sure what iOS provides over Android? I listen to music all day long and I've had just as enjoyable an experience on both Android and iOS. The iOS default music app is decent but there are better apps out there. On Android I get choices like https://www.doubletwist.com/cloudplayer which plays music from your cloud storage and the UI is really good.   Anyway all this to say that both iOS and Android are great choices, and most of the issues you're referring to are related to older iterations of Android, not with Lollipop or KitKat."
apple,3e1fgq,Recalc,0,Tue Jul 21 11:18:31 2015 UTC,"I picked Apple because the whole user experience has been really smooth for me. I know where everything I want and need is. Everything looks nice and clean. Very, very friendly. I haven't used Android OS extensively, but I have occasionally helped my father change a few settings here and there. I saw how there's like the homescreen then an app screen? (I don't really get that.) I like the simplicity of Apple's iOS. My apps are all there on the homescreen, and the single home button keeps navigating easy. I currently have an iPhone 6 Plus since December, and it's running fine. No degrade in performance. The design is beautiful, and there's only one phone on earth that runs iOS, iPhone."
apple,3e1fgq,stalechipz,0,Tue Jul 21 05:44:09 2015 UTC,"I had an iPod touch for 4 years, so that was my introduction to the Apple ecosystem. My first smartphone was a used iPhone 4, but my first ""high end"" smartphone was a Nexus 5, which I used for the past year. I just switched to an iPhone 6 Plus because of the battery life and better integration with my MacBook Pro.  I don't have a strong preference for either Android Lollipop or iOS 8. Both OSes have their pros and cons. I did have to root and use a custom ROM to be satisfied with Android, and I did have to jailbreak my iPhone to be satisfied with iOS.  I've only had my phone for a few weeks, so I'll tell you in 5 months."
apple,3e1fgq,seraph582,0,Tue Jul 21 05:53:47 2015 UTC,"What made you originally pick Apple, and why have you stayed?    It came out first - I've owned iPhones and have been jail breaking them since 2007. Been heavily invested in their ecosystem since and love it. I also worked for Apple for a year and that was cool too. Over at the Infinite Loop.    If there is anyone here who has used both the latest versions of Android and iOS, which do you prefer?    Yes I own an nVidia shield tablet and have Lollipop on it. I like it, but mostly because Im an nVidia fan and the tablet is a great vidya card accessory. It's also an ideal Android device because it runs near stock Android and doesn't have to wait on carriers to get their shit together for updates.    Do the phones get quite laggy after about 6 months to a year?    No. Though, I usually take my phone to an apple store if it starts acting up and get a new one. Takes about thirty minutes round trip from work, and they'll replace for damn near any reason. I've used ""dust in camera lens under glass"" several times.     Any other things you'd like to mention in attempt to sway me over to the fruit side.    Not really. High end Android is nice too, though it easy to get burned sometimes. I fucking hated my first gen Nex7, but have never had anything short of what's expected from Apple. The apps are consistently better and the games are a LOT better, but Android itself, when done right, is damn cool too.  Jail breaking is fucking awesome for getting all the extra stuff you want without having to jump over hurdles like flashing ROMs.  Pony up for at least a 32Gb phone if you do switch. I have a 128gigger and am only down to about 20gb free what with 30gb of cached music, 30gigabytes of photos, and the rest apps. Having to manage storage across multiple storage mediums on m nV shield and past android phones has been a tremendous turnoff, and as it turned out pre-kitkat, a tremendous security risk."
apple,3e1fgq,AndyIbanez,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"I chose Apple because I loved the apps my cousin had on his iPod Touch. Android was not around back then. Similarly, I stayed because the quality of third party apps, control over what apps can see, and a vast selection of apps is much better than what I have found on Android. Yes, I have both an iPhone 6+ and Samsung Galaxy S5, both running the latest versions of their respective OSes. For the iPhone, I have owned every iPhone except for the first one, the 3GS, the 5C, and the 6. As for Android, I have owned a Galaxy S2, and S4. So I have a lot of experience on both platforms. I have jailbroken, and I have rooted (also installed custom ROMs). It's cool you have customization on Android, but for me such things don't really matter. Again, app quality and variety is what keeps me on iPhone. Finally, not like it matters, but I am no longer jailbroken or rooted, and the Galaxy S5 will be the last Android device I own in a long time. They will run as good as the hardware allows. My iPhone 3G lasted me at least 3 years before it finally died, but if served me well and I don't remember having any complaints on its performance. It really depends on what you do and what you like. I find iOS to be vastly superior for everything I do. Beautiful developer tools (really important for me), app security, quality of apps, variety of apps, solid OS, it allows you to change your wallpaper, which is the only customization thing I personally care about, timely OS updates, integration with Apple's services if you use other Apple products, and a big one for me, privacy. If you are a big of customization, third party launchers, ROM mods, and don't mind Google collecting as per their ToS, you are fine on Android."
apple,3e1fgq,rohitknhs,0,Tue Jul 21 06:25:14 2015 UTC,"My first ever phone was a Blackberry 9000. The second was a Samsung Galaxy Y. The third was the S3. The fourh was once again a Blackberry Curve 9220. IMO, the Blackberry phones gave me a better experience than the Androids I've used. The reason I upgraded to Apple's iPhone was firstly, the need of having my iTunes library without issues. Second was having apps which ran smoothly without lag. Secondly, the 5 and the 5s look so beautiful I couldn't just not buy it. After using my 5s for over 16 months, it still works like a new phone. I like the ecosystem  I've used the Lollipop on my Mom's Moto G. It's fine but I feel iOS 8 lets me do tasks faster. The only place where I use my Android more than my iPhone is for watching videos. My 5s is not good enough for it but the new iPhones should do the job. I have a preference of iOS over Android but my needs from my phone is not like others so I can't comment if Android's better or not. No. in my 16 month usage of my iPhone 5s, I've never experienced lags or slow downs. However I do believe my battery life is not so good but it could change with iOS 9.  You can take backups of the whole phone with iOS which is kinda difficult on an Android. And Apple has a great customer service    I would suggest you to use an iPhone at an Apple Store before making a decision."

apple,3e1fgq,DJ-Salinger,0,Tue Jul 21 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Longtime Android user now on iOS.   What made you originally pick Apple?   Mostly novelty, part frustration with Google's management of Android.  The Google Play Services bug is incredibly frustrating, and the fact that so many apps can go rogue and drain your battery.  I found a $250 32GB 5S for sale on Swappa and decided to give it a shot   and why have you stayed?   Not having to manage my phone, and having a great, fast camera.   If there is anyone here who has used both the latest versions of Android and iOS, which do you prefer?   It's tough to say.  Obviously Android is more customizable so if that's your thing, stick with Android (though there is jailbreaking).  I would say they are both great for different reasons, and it's mostly a personal preference.   Do the phones get quite laggy after about 6 months to a year?   No, as I said, I have a 5s that's about 2 years old (bought used as well) and it is not laggy at all.  It actually performs better than my OnePlus One.  My gf even has a 4s which is 4 years old and it performs admirably for being so old.  iOS is much better in this regard.   Any other things you'd like to mention in attempt to sway me over to the fruit side.   I wouldn't try to sway you in either direction.

Was just the little things for me. Now years later I've had several iPhones, iPads, two rMBP's, etc. They work great together and Apple has a great ecosystem.

I bought the i7 with 8GB. The i7 could be optional but the 8GB is a must have always. If I were you I'd go for the Air, just have in mind that the resolution is not as good. I have another monitor connected so it is no big problem for me, but it really lacks of good screen, imho it is more confortable to program with good resolution. Also, 128 gb could be a little low. I thought that I could go perfectly with 128gb, but after a year or so, I think it would have better to get 256gb.  Overall I'm very happy with my Air (2013 model), nevertheless, I know that my next mac will probably be a Macbook Pro."
apple,3e3jop,aesptux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine graduated from college recently with a CS degree and swears by his Macbook Air. It's incredibly portable, which is a huge bonus if you need a computer as often as a CS student does. The battery life is also absurdly good as a bonus, you won't need to carry your charger with you to classes if you remember to charge it beforehand.  The Retina Pro is, of course, a more powerful beast, but it will cost you a little more. If all you plan to use it for is coding and browsing the web, it might be a bit overkill. It's also not as lightweight as the Air, though is still lighter and thinner than the typical laptop. The battery life is also still great for how powerful it is (I average ~8-10 hours most days unless I'm doing a lot of work). I personally use one, but I made use of a lot of more powerful applications like Photoshop and Illustrator that benefit from the better hardware, along with a few games of course.  So, I would say based on your needs, you'd probably benefit enough from the Air. Add a bit more RAM or SSD space if you think you'll need it (which you very well might), but other than that the basic hardware should be fine. If you care more about performance and the better display, possibly consider the Retina Pro, but only if you think it justifies the extra cost. If you do decide to do some more intense work in the future though, the Retina Pro provides more of a possibility."

apple,3e396n,holymadness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by saying it's refreshing to read an article that deals with watch satisfaction and quality, rather than dick-measuring metrics like sales. The watch is either good, mediocre, or bad—whether it sells 15M units or 3M units has no bearing on the question.  That being said, I disagree with the author. I've owned mine since launch day and every single day I am less and less satisfied, to the point where I barely wear it anymore. Apps, including Apple's stock apps, are very slow to load. The interface is somewhat rough (the screen is slow to turn on when raised, touches sometimes don't register, Siri's comprehension is very hit-and-miss and there's no way to correct her, the watch doesn't pick up dictation in noisy environments, it can't be used one-handed for most things, etc. etc.) Many notifications require you to take your phone out of your pocket to act on them, negating the ostensible usefulness of having them on your wrist. I've concluded that my initial enthusiasm was mainly due to novelty and that the v.1 of the watch isn't a stellar product.  Just a note, the author is mistaken when he writes ""Since my first month article, developers have added support for Outlook Mail."" Outlook doesn't have a watch app. Seems like something that basic fact-checking should have caught right away.  A last note: he writes, ""I am constantly amazed by the accuracy of the Apple Workout app that gathers my data without GPS and regular matches my GPS data within less than 10 percent difference,"" I'm somewhat appalled that he intends this as a compliment. 10% is a massive variation. If you run a 4-hour marathon, the watch could be off by 24 minutes!  EDIT: having re-read the article again, I really don't see any substance to it. Seems like a rehash of commonly-held opinions just to have an excuse to talk about Apple again. It's also full of very basic grammatical errors."

And it is still possible to sync contacts etc. just not to do backups. So just make it a known policy that they have to backup to iTunes.   But be aware that another downside is that you will have to do all service on the iPhones. Since they can't turn off find my iPhone apple won't even do a screen swap on the units. I recommend you have a hand full of extras so you can just swap them for a new one and deal with the service issue afterwards.

apple,3dz4bv,aquanext,13,Tue Jul 21 02:43:14 2015 UTC,"A very important consideration is establishing a backup strategy.  Macs come with this dead simple backup software built in called Time Machine. The easiest method is to get a dedicated external drive 1.5 to 2x times the size of your internal drive, plug it in, then point Time Machine at it. You'll need to make a regular habit of doing backups. You can get more serious about backup, but this is the minimum you need to implement.  We hear far too many horror stories on this sub about people who have experienced some horrible event (like theft or water damage) and have no backup of critical data, pictures, contacts, etc. Here's the Apple instructions:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250"
apple,3dz4bv,Prairie_Dog,3,Mon Jul 20 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"This should be modded much higher up. Backup strategies mean your work is good, your pics are good, and you can safely wipe on the case of corruption or virus.  The size is important, since time machine can have multiple save points. In my backup I disable backing up the system, since I know I want to reinstall anyway. Saves space. Also look j to wifi routers that you can attach a disk to. Asus routers and apple routers (and probably others) can do backups over wifi pretty painlessly. Just slow for the initial backup.   I'm a geek, programmer, and my wife is pretty ""let's just get stuff done"". But even with our differing needs We have minimal things, VLC, LibreOffice (now available from App Store for free - easy updates) Chrome, Firefox. Evernote is good if you have iOS devices to synch with, though with iOS 9 coming probably less essential. Maybe Google docs, BitTorrent sync, or Dropbox, depending which system you bought into for storage.   You can get by with surprisingly few downloads."
apple,3dz4bv,biffbobfred,18,Tue Jul 21 03:18:13 2015 UTC,"Download an app called ""CheatSheet"" first and foremost, absolutely before anything else. Best advice this sub and /r/mac ever gave me. It gives you quick access to learning some of the keyboard shortcuts. I wouldn't bootcamp or anything crazy yet, get used to your new os. Don't overwhelm yourself if you don't have to.  Caffeine is a good way to keep your macbook from shutting down if you're doing a big download or watching a movie or something and don't want it to sleep. One click to prevent sleep, one click to go back to normal. Easy stuff.  HyperDock gives some features that windows had that osx doesn't. Look it up on youtube. Not free, but I love it. Seriously look it up on youtube it has some of the features I missed most from windows.  VLC is my go-to video player. I stream music through spotify so I don't use it to play music (not sure how good it works) but it's fantastic for watching video files of almost any extension.  Microsoft Office 2016 just came out not long ago if you have Office 365. Either way, Microsoft Office for Mac if you're doing any work on it. Pages/Numbers/whatever their default apps are work fine but you'll have to convert the file eventually and that's annoying.  I use Hazel to help organize my files and keep my computer clean. Costs a bit, but has a two week trial of full functionality, so even if you don't use it after the trial, maybe give it a shot. Basically you tell it a folder to look at, and a file description, and tell it what to do with that file. Example: In my downloads folder, if I download a .dmg file (like a program installer file), it automatically runs the file and then send it to the trash. It's good for both one-time rules (mass re-naming of files, file transfers/organization, etc.) and recurring events (like the downloads folder I just explained). I used it during the trial to rename all the pictures I uploaded from my old computer based off their ""date created"" date and time, to make it easier to sort them. Stuff like that. Also, any time I upload pictures to my pictures folder from my phone, it automatically imports them to the Photos app.  Dolphin/OpenEmu if you want to emulate any old games. I just recently started playing Wind Waker and Banjo Kazooie again.  I use evernote for notes, and I use google drive for file storage and picture syncing from my phone (android).  (EDIT: I also recommend The Unarchiver if you use a lot of weird compressed files. You might not, but if you do run into something you can't extract, try this app. It's free.  Also, if you like natural scrolling on the trackpad but don't like it on your mouse, you can get an app called Scroll Reverser. The icon is a blue vertical arrow pointing both up and down. It lets you change the scrolling style for each device independently, so my trackpad can scroll naturally but my mouse scrolls regularly.)  But seriously, before you go clutter your brand new mac with a bunch of stupid stuff, learn the basics. Download CheatSheet to learn the keyboard shortcuts and mess around with it all. Last thing you want to do is download a million apps and extensions because people recommend them. Learn with the defaults, and when you need stuff, then install it. You might not need Hazel, or Hyperdock, or Caffeine, or Bootcamp, or anything like that. Don't clutter up your beautiful new machine with a bunch of crap just because someone recommended it. It'll only slow your new macbook down and be annoying down the road."

Here's a list of everything I've downloaded:  -Firefox  -Lightroom  -Paintbrush  -The Unarchiver  Seriously that's it. I love how this machine just has everything I need on it. Out of those 4 programs I'd say only The Unarchiver is a must-have. For when you need to unzip files.
apple,3dz4bv,AppleTurnovers,4,Mon Jul 20 20:25:07 2015 UTC,I'm going to make a plea for the OP to try Safari. It's really great on OS X.
apple,3dz4bv,aquanext,3,Tue Jul 21 00:16:05 2015 UTC,"No doubt OP should try Safari, it's a great browser. I use it 90% of the time and I wish I could say 100% but it doesn't load some websites reliably enough for me :/"
apple,3dz4bv,AppleTurnovers,2,Tue Jul 21 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"Safari is amazing for the casual user, but as a web developer i can't bring myself to use a browser that only adopts new HTML standards with a OS update, plus their dev tools are sub standard and had a lack of decent extensions."

Are you interacting with really specific stuff for IE and such -- like intranet web apps for schools or corp networks or something?  It's so close to Chrome, it shouldn't have too many problems. But I take you at your word."
apple,3dz4bv,aquanext,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"Nothing specific at all. For example on www.windmobile.ca scroll to ""My Wind"" on the top right and click ""My Account"". Does it load for you? It doesn't for me.  As well for my current mobile carrier Virgin Mobile Canada, it loads the main page and the sign in page, but once I enter all my info and sign in, I just get the background of the website and none of the other elements load.  These are what I can think of off the top of my head."
apple,3dz4bv,AppleTurnovers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:12 2015 UTC,Loads for me! Are you running any ad-blockers? I've found those really make random sites unstable.

apple,3dz4bv,AppleTurnovers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:32:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is. However, this is an excellent opportunity for me to pitch a good password manager. I started using 1Password about two years ago and it has changed my life. I rarely end up in a situation where I don't know what my password is anymore. It is 100% worth the cost.  If you are not just using OS X, like at work, consider buying it directly from their website. If you buy it from the App Store, you'll need to buy it again to get the Windows version in order to keep that stuff in sync."
apple,3dz4bv,aquanext,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:57 2015 UTC,Worldspan ONLY works in IE. Nothing else. It's a pain in the ass. I have to run parallels that runs IE for me to be able to use it. That's the only reason why I have another browser though is because the app work requires me to use only runs on IE.

apple,3dyrji,NorbertDupner,12,Mon Jul 20 18:24:49 2015 UTC,First of all the original iPod could only work on a Mac. This greatly reduced the potential customers considering that the Mac market share is pretty low and back then it was even lower. So until the iPod launched on Windows it was a niche product.
apple,3dyrji,PolyethyleneAirbag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"The same argument could be made for the fact that the apple watch needs an iPhone to work. Not a perfect analogy considering the market share of the iPhone is streets ahead of the market share of the Mac back then, but I think people forget that it still is a limit on the possible market penetration in the wearable industry for the watch."
apple,3dyrji,jrcabby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:16 2015 UTC,I understand that but like you said you need to have an iPhone which has a much larger install base and lots of them are extremely loyal. So if the sales are that low it's not really good for Apple's standards.
apple,3dyrji,PolyethyleneAirbag,0,Mon Jul 20 20:18:13 2015 UTC,And how did it sell when it first launched on Windows in 2003?  Let's see.

apple,3dxty9,Poynsid,44,Mon Jul 20 19:39:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how many people realize it, but the library of apps is probably the iPhone's single greatest strength.    I resisted getting an iOS device for a long time because I'm just not a huge fan of the interface. I think Windows Phone and BB10 are a lot more innovative and imaginative. I love apps, but I like an OS that does a lot of what I need without me needing a seperate app for everything more. I'd prefer to have an interactive home screen and some kind of ""hub"" to let me manage all my social media and pics from people without my needing to jump in and out of different apps all day...    But I cannot argue with the functional simplicity of iOS, it does work for what it is and it is fairly easy to learn. I also cannot argue with the apps. iOS has an absolutely amazing library of high-quality apps. Many of which aren't available on other devices and when they are, the iOS version is almost always superior.    I have two iOS devices now. Still not a fan of the stale grid of icons motif and having to pump the home button constantly to do anything...but I can't argue that the OS isn't very polished and the apps really make the difference.    I am hoping one day Apple will reimagine the home screen and the UI though and take it beyond the same static icon grid I had on my Palm Pilot in 1996 :(  The fact they are finally adding the capability to run two apps on screen at once in iOS 9 is the first really encouraging sign of the kind of change I want in a long time, so I am happy about that."

apple,3dxty9,Pfheonix,6,Mon Jul 20 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yup, I was with Windows Phone for about 3 years. Loved it. Only reason I got an iPhone this time is that there are no real flagship WP phones on AT&T now, and I've never had an iPhone and wanted to finally try one out. I'm kind of biding my time until Windows 10 mobile rolls out and Microsoft/Nokia finally delivers some real flagships again.    Windows Phone was the only smartphone OS I've used that I loved and understood immediately. iOS is an acquired taste. After 3 months of luke warm enthusiasm, I finally like it and I'm comfortable with it. That said, I don't know that I will ever LOVE iOS the way I love Windows Phone. It wouldn't take too much for MS to win me back. Just don't screw WP10 up and built some desirable phones for AT&T and there is a good chance I'll come back.    The more time that passes though the less likely it becomes. I am a Mac user primarily and the longer I'm on iOS the more Apple's ecosystem tentacles are taking root in my life. I have to admit it is nice to be on a more mature platform that is so polished and has all the essentials worked out. The app selection and quality is astounding too."
apple,3dxty9,brigadier_lethbridge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"Very true, but given the apps I used for two years weren't particularly varied, and nothing special was needed past the built in apps, I found myself loving Windows Phone. I just want flagships, same as you."
apple,3dxty9,johnthepaptest,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is one of the things I liked best about Windows Phone. I didn't feel so much need for apps. I would actually prefer to do more inside the OS. I like getting info at a glance from live tiles and I loved the hub feature, I wish they'd expand on that. The less hopping in and out of apps I need to do to accomplish things, the better. The iPhone seems to come from the opposite school of thought. The OS is just kind of an app launcher and you need to jump in and out of a separate app for every task."

apple,3dxty9,Pfheonix,2,Tue Jul 21 06:57:57 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to what phone you're using now. I have an iPhone 5, and my girlfriend uses a 5S. I tested a 6+ for about 3 days after selling my Nexus 6, and eventually went with a One Plus One. While the 6+ is smooth, the OPO is very close, and honestly multitasking is much better without a hardware home button. IMO, my Nexus 5 and OPO are smoother than her 5S, and my Nexus 4 is smoother than my iPhone 5 running 8.4. I personally wouldn't use anything else other than stock Android as almost every phone I've used with a manufacturer skin is laggy. The Android M developer preview 2 is a lot smoother than 5.1.1, and Google seems to be going in the right direction."

For example, Messenger. It has lag. Why? Apparently sending a message causes so much strain that the UI lags. This is why having the UI in the same thread as the main process is bad. It waits on that, thus stutter."

If it's the Verizon SMS app, then switch to something else. That app is a mess. I had a friend who was using it and I was shocked how bad it was. The Google SMS app won't do that, and if you want an SMS app with more customization try Textra or awSMS. awSMS is similar to the jailbreak SMS app biteSMS.

The mobile experience is driven by apps--it has to be now. So while people may not know that there are apps that let you look at the stars in certain ways, they do know that between Google Play and the App Store, apps can change the way a person uses their phone. Which seems to be the message of the ad."
apple,3dxty9,thefeedtobe,7,Mon Jul 20 13:57:59 2015 UTC,"You haven't run into many people who don't know this because we, as people, tend to surround ourselves with like-minded people of the same general education level and interests. Just because you don't know anyone who doesn't know this, doesn't mean there aren't billions of people out there who just don't get it.  For example, it's safe to assume that you and your friends know what reddit is. It's also safe to assume that the 36 million registered users on reddit know this too, but while 36 million people sounds like a lot, it's .4% of the world's population. the overwhelmingly vast majority of people on the planet most likely have no idea what the hell this site is that you and your friends all know about it."

As far as the reddit comment goes, I'm not sure that it's accurate--I'd venture to say most of my friends don't know what reddit is. But I'm not sure it's comparable, for the reason that reddit isn't something people come into contact with often. Owning a smartphone is something people actively choose, meaning that the App Store is presented to them both on their phone and in popular culture. Hundreds of millions of people own smartphones and apps have been driven into our brains as vital. People aren't buying an iPhone or Android device because of the App Store, but rather get involved with the App Store because they own an iPhone."

It is still an attempt to inform the uninformed out there that their app store has tons of apps to choose from, though.

Even when Android does get something, I feel like its more likely to have issues. I've done dev work on both, and one issue with Android is the shit ton of devices with different skins, and different versions, and testing your app on how it'll look/feel on different things. It becomes so much of a timesink, we said fuck it to testing with certain devices. So then you use an Android phone and you need a certain app, lets say a ruler app. Then you open the ruler app and the dev is using a kind of psuedo TouchWiz interface that looks awful. The functionality is nice, but its just awful looking. iOS apps just tend to look nicer, behave better, and the App store tends to have more quality apps IMO. Android has more flexibility, in that you can do crazy shit with it, and change really anything you don't like, but the freedom of customization comes with an opportunity cost."

But I truly believe that unlike a console, games and apps can't sell an iPhone. The overall OS experience can, which the App Store is definitely a part of. Does the App Store help? Of course. Do I think it's a main selling point for the average consumer? No. But with that being said, people do use the apps when they get the phone and I think that the App Store is a huge factor of customer retention."

apple,3e1sxe,kirklennon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"Does this happen only when you connect to wifi and have really good LTE service or does it happen more frequently?   It's hard to say, actually. Basically, it happens whenever iOS thinks it's a good time. For one thing, it learns when you use apps, and are therefore likely to want it already updated. If you're a solid 10pm-6am sleeper, it's not going to check for updated information at midnight; it'll wait till the morning. Also, these updates are absolute lowest priority. If your battery is low, or service is spotty, it's just not going to bother. It also tries to combine requests. So if you've been inactive on your phone for a while, but then start checking your email, it might decide that now is a great time to update some stuff in the background. You've probably noticed when waking your phone sometimes that it'll show LTE for a second before switching to WiFi. It takes less energy to connect to only one at a time, and it needs to stay connected to LTE because it's, well, a phone, so it'll shut down WiFi most of the time when it sleeps. But when you do wake it up, and it connects to WiFi, that's a good time for it to hurry up and update things that it thinks you'll want.  The precise logic that goes into all of these decisions is complicated and not publicly documented (to the best of my knowledge), but the gist is that it tries to intelligently guess when and what apps (that have asked) should be refreshed based on the totality of the circumstances."

apple,3dzx29,Contramundi324,12,Mon Jul 20 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, AppleCare+ is only available for iOS devices, so you are just looking at AppleCare.  I have had a Mac mini that the integrated sound card failed in after a year and a half, so this ended up being a logic board replacement I didn't have to pay for.  My partner had a logic board replaced in a 2007 15"" MacBook Pro right at the end of his 3-year AppleCare Warranty.  Given that today's Macs are almost all integrated parts, which are mounted the main board, there really aren't any cheap fixes anymore. Any repair will be major, and expensive. You also get three years of free customer support in addition to extended warranty. It seems a good investment to me."
apple,3dzx29,Prairie_Dog,4,Mon Jul 20 22:10:00 2015 UTC,It sounds worth it; I just wanted to hear some would be horror stories if not for Apple Care
apple,3dzx29,Emptyless,4,Mon Jul 20 22:17:57 2015 UTC,Well i used Apple support for a hardware issue with my powerbutton not functioning. As this was a hardware issue and was not my fault it was still covered. A+ service   Don't know exactly what AppleCare can add to that ;)
apple,3dzx29,iocchelli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:54 2015 UTC,Mid-2010 MBP. I also had my logic board replaced three days before the end of my 3-year Warranty. It was giving me hiccups for about two weeks before so I took it in expecting a fight. Nope. All good. Well worth the couple hundred bucks.
apple,3dzx29,bongoherbert,6,Tue Jul 21 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"In my personal case, MBP Retina * screen failed 6 months in - replaced screen * battery had premature-failure 1.5 years - replaced battery+keyboard/topcase * GPU took a leap last month - replaced mobo  So, in my case, totally worth it.

apple,3dzx29,upsidedownfunnel,0,Tue Jul 21 01:10:34 2015 UTC,Well the screen would've been covered under the normal warranty. There seem to be a lot of issues with MacBooks. Everyone talks about needing AppleCare and having to fix their computer several times over the three year period.

apple,3dzx29,illyasv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"Apple care is like insurance. You are buying peace of mind. Yes.. it's a lot of money for something that you most likely will not use.  I've always bought it, thankfully, never had to use it. (2 macbook pros 1 iMac & a Mac pro)  However a couple of machines in my office have, boy are we glad we did buy it for them.  So, I will always get it as long as I can afford it."
apple,3dzx29,ProfessorPhi,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"If you are in school or using it for work and it is your only computer, AppleCare is more than a good idea. Totally worth the chances. However, my 2002 PowerBook had its first problem after about four years, HDD failed so luckily I could replace that myself. My 2007 iMac had zero problems for first almost five years of its life, then the logic board failed. My 2011 MacBook Air that I bought in early 2012 has had zero problems.  So in three of three Mac computer purchases of mine, I had no problems in their first three years. Two of the three made it four years (third isn't that old yet). The 2002 PowerBook is still functioning - one HDD replacement at four years, DVD drive failed at about six years, and two battery replacements and needs another - but that's great for a 13 year old laptop, it has totally outlived OS updates.  But I would still urge a student or one who uses it for work to get AppleCare. And even though my desktop died and my laptops have not, I would urge a laptop buyer toward AppleCare more than a desktop buyer, just since portability brings risks of accidents."
apple,3dzx29,Ohmm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:35:17 2015 UTC,Definitely get one. I have 2012 rMBP and so far it was very useful. Unfortunately its only for 3 years. I have just replaced battery for free (=300$) and back in 2013 I replaced display (ghosting). Both times I received back laptop on the same day. Quick and definitely saves money in the long term.
apple,3dzx29,paka22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"It's best thought of as insurance. Now is there a ~10% chance your macbook likely to fail in the next 3 years? If more than 10% buy it, less than 10% don't.  It's not even  insurance, in that they only fix manufacturer problems. However for peace of mind, its potentially worth it.  For my families past 4 macbooks, I've never needed any repairs inside 3 years, one died after 4 years and another had a sata cable die after 4 years. I haven't used applecare yet, so I'm not convinced."

apple,3dzx29,therealjohnwhite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, totally worth it.

apple,3dzx29,therealjohnwhite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:34 2015 UTC,"Look into square trade as well. Explore your options.  I would go with Apple Care if you aren't tech savvy.  Keep in mind Square trade covers accidental as well.  If I were you I would check with Amex and if they do extend your warranty, go ahead and purchase square trade - if you ever have a spill or major drop you are completely covered.    If you rent, check your renters insurance and see what they cover as well."
apple,3dzx29,circledcornershop,2,Tue Jul 21 05:53:35 2015 UTC,"While I'll agree SquareTrade offers better protection (and you can take your laptop into an Apple Store and have it serviced if you use the excuse of needing it back quickly/being unable to ship it, just send them the invoice to be reimbursed), I believe their warranties carry a per-incident deductible fee.  Also, as a college student who goes to school in the boonies, Apple will overnight a box with prepaid label to you, fix it and have it back in your hands overnighted, I've not waited longer than 4 days and needed this done twice on a MBPr."
apple,3dzx29,tincanmanrdt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:47:10 2015 UTC,"Good point! I think it really comes down to if you really want the accidental coverage and can come up 100 in a pinch (or having savings). I treat it like any other type of insurance.    I say this because I have seen more Apple products destroyed by accidental damage (I've seen at least 4 macbook pros destroyed by liquid spills on the keyboard) than hardware failure. But again this is my limited experience.  I've met a guy who had to send his Macbook in 4 times within the first 2 years of purchase. Sometimes it just comes down to luck.  We all have different experiences, needs, and wants.  My best advice to OP is to be honest about your situation and evaluate what kind of protection you feel is most necessary."

apple,3dv027,Barkovitch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"Totally with you on the non-removable part, but you'd still think there would be a basic app or you could just play them through stock audio app (like I should still be able to do on Apple without using the crappy Podcasts app)."
apple,3dv027,JosephFinn,127,Mon Jul 20 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"For me, Overcast can't be matched. Playing podcasts through Siri would be really nice, but Smart Speed has saved me so much time and the app fits my needs well. Apple's Podcast app isn't bad, but I think Overcast is a standout."
apple,3dv027,thefeedtobe,42,Sun Jul 19 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"I switched from Podcasts to Overcast, but switched back after a couple weeks. Smart Speed saved time I didn't really care about, but made everything sound weird, completely destroyed speech pacing. Add on top a horrendous experience on the 6+, I switched back. The 9.0 beta is a huge upgrade that adds the only thing I missed from Overcast - just a straight playlist of unplayed episodes in order of publishing."

apple,3dv027,7thton,2,Mon Jul 20 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"It's very useful. Unfortunately in the 9 beta (or at least on my device) the iTunes functionality is broken so you can't add feeds. But they sync from other devices so if you're iPad is running 8.4 stable as mine, then just add on there and wait for the sync to go through."
apple,3dv027,mb862,2,Sun Jul 19 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"I tried using Overcast once. I couldn't get the one podcast I wanted to listen to to work, and then the app sent me about 20 push notifications with that podcast title, even though I still couldn't listen to it. I uninstalled it soon after."
apple,3dv027,Dydegu,0,Mon Jul 20 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"I tried using Overcast as well. It just tanked on me every time at launch. I only moved away from the default Podcasts app because it stops letting me download feeds and eventually, wouldn't even let me play some of them.  I moved to Downcast and couldn't be happier.  I don't even do speed listening, helps to have something longer on my long bus rides.Of course, I'm subbed to 60+ podcasts, so I'm not entirely surprised various podcast apps are groaning under the strain."
apple,3dv027,affirmedatheist,3,Mon Jul 20 04:57:18 2015 UTC,Hmm. What was your experience on the 6+? Mine has been working just fine.
apple,3dv027,thefeedtobe,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:25 2015 UTC,"The iOS9 beta is nice generally, but in Podcasts the lack of a sleep timer is killing me. I have to use the timer app in conjunction to get near the same functionally; I can't imagine why it was removed."
apple,3dv027,luqavi,7,Mon Jul 20 07:54:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. Overcast is miles ahead of anything else to me.

apple,3dv027,plazman30,7,Mon Jul 20 01:25:27 2015 UTC,"2 reasons:   I can set playback speed in 0.1 increments.  I listen to my podcasts at 1.7x. The new web player lets me listen to my podcasts on PC, regardless of OS.  Downcast's app is MacOS only."
apple,3dv027,snark_nerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"And, if I may ask, why do you prefer it to Overcast? As you probably know, Overcast has features to speed up listening (but better), and it has a web interface that supports Handoff and their Smart Speed features."
apple,3dv027,plazman30,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"Does the web interface support speed up playback also, with pitch correction, or just Smart Speed?  EDIT:  Just installed Overcast.  Not too bad.  The Web interface is nice, but not as good as Pocket Casts.  i think I like the UI for Pocket Casts better on the iPhone.  The big plus for me is the Android app.  But overall they're pretty similar.  EDIT 2:  Also discovered you set set podcasts in Pocket Casts to auto start so many seconds into the podcast.  That way you can auto skip credits.  Pretty sweet.  Overcast doesn't seem to do that."
apple,3dv027,opie2,5,Mon Jul 20 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"I just switched to Overcast because the native iOS Podcast app is driving me out of my fucking mind. It continues, despite all efforts on my part, to download multiple versions of the same podcast to my library, and shows them as unsubscribed half of the time when I am in fact subscribed to them. I've tried deleting, I've tried resetting, I've tried every possible thing I can think of, to no avail. It's just broken."
apple,3dv027,NXELPPA,5,Sun Jul 19 23:10:08 2015 UTC,I switched because of the poor syncing support.  If you want separate settings on multiple devices you're pretty much screwed.  I haven't missed having podcasts on all my devices since overcast.

The bad news is that somehow Siri through the watch can't use those new features, only Siri from the phone itself so I didn't need to switch in the first place. Still, I never would have given it another shot and it's really not that bad (anymore)."
apple,3dv027,Outlulz,11,Sun Jul 19 19:11:04 2015 UTC,I had to switch from the stock app to Downcast Overcast.  The Podcast app was complete shit.  Most times I would leave home to find my podcasts did not automatically download as they should have.  If I tried to manually download it (wifi or over the air) it would just give an error and I would not be able to download any podcasts without syncing them from my laptop.  Sometimes I would try to listen to a podcast to find it had lost all progress from the previous session.  Sometimes they wouldn't play at all.  Sometimes a podcast would stop midway through and delete itself.  This is all after trying backup and restores and factory resets of the device.  No problems at all with Downcast Overcast.  I've disliked the Podcast app ever since they were separated from the regular music app because it always was glitchy and I have no intention of ever going back to it.
apple,3dv027,swanny246,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Podcasts app was utter shit when it first broke up with the Music (iPod) app. No idea why it was so bad, but it's definitely a lot better now though."
apple,3dv027,Manic020,4,Mon Jul 20 06:44:29 2015 UTC,"I did the exact opposite switch because the Apple app was deleting episodes after I downloaded them but before I could listen to them, so I was having to download each new episode like three times before it finally stuck."
apple,3dv027,quinn_drummer,4,Sun Jul 19 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"I've just done exactly the same thing.  I love Downcast, have been using it on all my devices for a couple of years, but decided to give Podcast.app a go again, partly because I like the beautify artwork view (which I wish the Mac had) and partly because nearly everything else I use is within Apple Eco system so I wanted to give it a shot.  And, like you, have found all the problems that used to be present to be gone. Everything syncs nicely, including episode positions which are almost instantaneous and this used be a massive problem. Now if it sticks just refresh the podcast it works.  It's also nice to not have to have another app open on my Mac.  I used to keep Downcast open all the time as I have a lot of podcast subscriptions that are updating and syncing daily, if I didn't keep it open it'd take 5mins to download new podcasts and sync everything up.  As I always have iTunes open anyway everything is just syncing in the background with just the one app open instead of two.  It's a shame Siri doesn't work through the watch, or that there isn't a dedicated podcast app on watch, hopefully that'll come in the future."
apple,3dv027,a7c,6,Sun Jul 19 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like the default podcast app. The only issue for me sometimes it the app will randomly decide not to download episodes in the background on wifi.

Let's say you use the Podcasts app for listening to your podcasts. In OS X, everything's perfect. But those that you can't play in the iOS app? They're still in the app. You just can't play them. And if you delete them, they get deleted from OS X.  I've never understood it. And it's something they seemingly refuse to fix."

Trying to scrub through a track will cause you to jump to an arbitrary point in the podcast, or worse, will restart the podcast entirely.

The iPhone camera lens has a fixed aperture, so that cannot be adjusted.  On my phone I have four apps for this, because I can't decide on one:  VSCOcam is a pretty decent option, though I find their UI overcomplex. It is free.  Camera+ has been around forever, and they also do a pretty good job. 99 cents.  ProCam manages a pretty close approximation of a DSLR UI, and has tons of features.

Rumors went so far as to claim an Apple television had been spotted in Jony Ive's office.  I think I'd rather see a TV than a car from Apple. Nobody makes a TV that excites me. I have a nice unit from Sony that I love and it's a great TV but it's never truly excited me. Tesla makes a great car that I would buy today if I had the $. Given that Apple is not know for low prices, we can't expect Apple to build a car that will cost less than a Tesla. Plus wouldn't it hurt Tesla if Apple builds a car?  They do some things amazingly well. Computers, phones, music... a TV would make some sense. But a car? That's so far outside of their wheelhouse. However, I have to believe if they are really working on one, and it appears, at least given the people they've hired, that they are, they think they can bring something new to the industry and that excites me.

apple,3dwdep,robaroo,3,Mon Jul 20 11:30:01 2015 UTC,"i think low power mode might mean different things for different people so one feature that applies to all might cause more trouble than solve. for example, i go into airplane mode when i want to go on low power mode but my girlfriend will just turn down the brightness of her screen, and vibrations, and a lot of push notifications. so i'm on the drastic side and she's on the less notifications and brightness side. features that you would be okay with being turned off might not be the same features that someone else would want turned off under low power mode. the people who really need a lower power mode already know what to do so it's best to just leave that feature out."

The iPad Pro is being released to compete with the Surface, but what you've said about the Macbook seems to be pure speculation in line with what people usually expect from a product. Apple has actually gone out in public and said that their goal is to have a product eventually with no ports, and they've never gone backwards in terms of making a product thicker, so there should be no space for the extra ports that you're talking about, unless they've gone back on their design philosophy.

The Air will not be redesigned, it will stay as a ""budget"" offering alongside the rMB and rMBP's.    Well his I can't agree with fully.   It really depends upon how well the new Mac Book is received.    Frankly I can't see overwhelming good sales for the Mac Book as it is a little too limited for most users.    The Air is possibly one of the best student / traveling laptops made right now.    As such I can see the machine receiving a redesign that try's to keep it significant in its niche.    By the way why would a redesign move it out of the budget realm?   Apple has been designing budget solutions for a long time, they won't stop because of the Mac Book or any other product.    Somethings like USB-C would be obvious wins in a machine like the Air and with SkyLake wouldn't cost Apple much in the way of extra hardware.  Well an obvious win if they put more than one port in the machine."

I can see that pulling out the phone will only be for needed responses to emails or texts, look up information, or to just kill time."

apple,3dysgg,Docster87,5,Mon Jul 20 20:53:20 2015 UTC,Agreed.  16 gb is not enough for the majority of people unless you are only using it for email and web browsing.  Any usage of apps/games and you're going to have a bad time.
apple,3dysgg,insdog,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:52 2015 UTC,I'm quite happy with my 16GB iPad and iPhone.  I use about 17 apps on average ranging from different social networks to other online services such as eBay and YouTube (and I use both devices thoroughly). Never had a storage issue. I guess I'm the minority but people like me are probably why Apple still makes 16GB devices. XD
apple,3dysgg,RAIKANA,3,Mon Jul 20 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"If I took my top ten largest games, I doubt if all ten of them would fit on a 16GB iDevice... World of Tanks alone is a 2.5GB game and I've got several just under 2GB.   If I didn't game I would still have problems since I have Terabytes of media I could throw on it.   16GB can work, my iPhone is 16GB but I don't keep games or media on it. My iPad is 64GB and pretty much always close to full and if I upgraded to 128GB it would stay pretty much full also."

apple,3dysgg,hansorg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:56:23 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind though that when you get a 16 GB iDevice, you actually get around 12.5 GB of usable storage. Just judge it off of how much storage you use on your Nexus. If you only have like 6 GB of stuff on your Nexus, then just get the 16, but if you use more than 10 GB on your Nexus, get the 32. Also remember that there's a lot of really fun games on the App Store that are free and around 1.5 - 2 GB."

apple,3dy980,dlheidemann,11,Mon Jul 20 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"I had a 5S when I bought the iPad Mini 2. I thought that iPad was fantastic, and I took it everywhere I went. I read a lot of books and wasted time on amrc, and it was the perfect size for casual use: not too cumbersome, lightweight, retina display, etc.  Then I got the 6 Plus when it launched. Even though I fought it, the iPad Mini 2 was relegated to my desk while everything I once did on it switched over to my phone. The 6 Plus' screen looked just as great as the Mini, and the size difference was minimal. It really did feel like a mini tablet in my pocket.   The 6 Plus is the best phone I've ever owned, but I decided to try and use my Mini again about a week ago. I've been switching my reading materials back onto it (books, magazines, comics), and when I'm in my apartment I've started to pick it up for random browsing.   If I'd owned a full-sized iPad instead of the Mini, I don't think I would have stopped using it so quickly, if at all.   TL:DR My 6 Plus replaced my tablet use almost instantly, but that may be because the Mini was so close in size and usability to my iPhone. I've since started using it again."
apple,3dy980,SirLaxer,3,Mon Jul 20 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting. I was considering the mini just out of compactness and easy of portability, but I was also wondering if the 6 Plus was practically a mini, and it sounds like it is. Thanks for confirming that.   I have a full size iPad, and the fact that it's slow and heavy makes me not want to use it as much anymore. My 5S is still too small to do any serious reading/browsing on so I find myself sort of stuck in between."
apple,3dy980,SirLaxer,4,Mon Jul 20 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"If I could do it all over again, I would have gotten the newest iPad Air instead of the Mini 2, but at the time I had no idea that the 6 Plus would exist (there were rumors, but no official news). As for whether or not it could be your primary device, I (delicately) say that it comes down to what you're reading and how good your eyes are. I'm young, and I love reading tiny text because I can. I even read my comics on the screen (it's not ideal, but it's convenient). My dad, on the other hand, has an iPhone 6 and has to go to his iPad to read emails and whatnot because he can't deal with any mobile screen for reading stuff.   As a side note, the 6 Plus' battery is FANTASTIC. I've had it since launch and it regularly lasts 12-13 with constant use."

I use my iPad daily too, mostly for note taking, comics, or if I'm at home I'll use it as a second screen for YouTube achievement/trophy guides.

Not much else since I purchsed a 6 Plus. With the larger iPad(s) you'll be able to use split screen mode on iOS 9, which should be a game changer (again, IMO). The 6 Plus is great as an all-around device, like the Swiss Army knife of productivity. However, you might be able to get a lot more of the heavy app switching tasks done on a large screen iPad."

Probably not the generic answer you wanted, but the fact of the matter is, that it depends on personal preference/what kind of work you have to get done. I like to use the iPad to edit photos and AirPlay stuff when I don't want my phone bogged down. I will often times facetime on the ipad and rage on my cell @ the same time. It's all about spreading out the work if you're a heavy user. Obviously I have my laptop screen open in front of me as well, and the three make an awesome and satisfying team."

All of a sudden your iPhone goes from a nice small object to absolutely massive. I really considered the 6 Plus because the giant screen is wonderful, but I just couldn't get past how huge and heavy it was (light for its size, but very heavy for an iPhone). I chose the 6 instead and I have no regrets – the screen size increase over the 5S is still pretty significant, but you get used to the size very quickly and the weight increase is minimal.  As for the iPads, if you do choose the 6 Plus, the iPad mini is too close in size, so you'll want to choose one of the iPad Airs. Coming from an iPad 3, you'll be amazed at how light they are when the displays are just as large. The 6 is small enough that an iPad mini would be worth having alongside it, but unless you want something even lighter or are looking to save money, the full-size iPads provide a better experience in my opinion, especially if that's what you're used to.  TL;DR: Prepare yourself for quite an adjustment if you choose the 6 Plus. I recommend an iPhone 6 and iPad Air – an appropriately sized phone and a full-sized tablet gives you the best experience in both categories."

Funny enough, for the first time ever just the other day, my 5S suddenly felt small in my hand. I was just out grocery shopping or something and it was like, whoa this thing is small.

For example, I want to try more iOS games, but I don't want to load them on my phone. They eat up a lot of storage and usually send a lot of notifications.

The echo works because Amazon has tons of spare cloud cycles sitting around and lots of data they've gathered. Apple would need to play catch up for it to work as well as the Echo service. The Echo is also extensible and can use other sources (Pandora/Tune In/etc). Unless Apple followed suit, they might not do well.  All of these problems seem marginal given Apple's resources. Why they don't currently increase capacity for Siri is a little weird."

They pretty much have everything already. ""Hey Siri"" already incorporates a wide variety of functionality. It wouldn't take much effort on Apple's part to ""polish"" it and deepen the integration further into all of their other services.   Things like:...    ""Hey Siri,.. play the latest episode of ""Game of Thrones"" on the Bedroom TV"" ""Hey Siri,.. make sure house doors are locked.""   etc...etc... would be pretty easy to do, given current devices that tie into HomeKit, etc."

The magnetic connector includes a plug and a receptacle. In one embodiment, the plug and receptacle can be used as part of a power adapter for connecting an electronic device, such as a laptop computer, to a transformer connectable to a power supply.

You have to look at the claims for that. For example:   An apparatus for electrically connecting an electronic device to an electrical relation, comprising: a first connector having a first magnetic element and having at least one first contact electrically connected to the electronic device; and a second connector positionable adjacent the first connector, the second connector having a second magnetic element and having at least one second contact electrically connected to the electrical relation, wherein the at least one first contact comprises a metallic contact extending from a first face of the first connector and biased relative to the first face, wherein magnetic attraction between the first and second magnetic elements substantially maintains the first and second contacts in an electrically conductive relationship, wherein the first and second connectors each comprise two axes of symmetry such that the first and second connectors couple together in only two orientations relative to one another, and wherein the at least one first and second contacts of the first and second connectors each comprise a pair of first path contacts on the connector for establishing a first path of electrical communication between the device and the relation, wherein the pairs of first path contacts form an electrically conductive relationship with one another regardless of which of the two orientations the connectors are magnetically coupled.   This is an example of what is actually protected by the patent, and what the Znaps product would need to avoid infringing (that, and all the other claims in the patent)."

Both of these, to non audiophiles, will sound relatively flawless (gone are the days of 128kbps MP3 sounding like a tin can). At 128kbps OGG Vorbis will take up approximately 1MB/Min. OPUS is often slightly larger.  EDIT: Do note that OPUS and OGG are often encoded in a mode called ""VBR"" which means that while you tell it 128, it'll often vary a bit around there. Hence why you can't give an exact estimation of size/time. Opus goes further outside the given input than OGG, hence larger size.

Especially compared to mp3 128kbps which still sounds trashy (not all 128kbps are equal).  Ah well this isn't the place to fight over audio preferences.

apple,3dt9n6,afrobat,-64,Sun Jul 19 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Apple's software in general is designed terribly. The fact that a ""Tips"" app even exists to explain this stuff is more indicative of an overarching problem. There are too many features hidden within the apps and iOS in general with absolutely no visual cues whatsoever of its existence.   Why is the software designed in such a way that there are features that have taken this long for people to figure out? Why are there no visual cues for something like panorama direction switching? Why is ""Request Desktop Site"" and ""Add to Favorites"" hidden behind tap location bar -> swipe down on the ""Recently Visited"" page? Why is there no visual cue when a notification has interactive functions? And if Force Touch is going to be enacted in the same way that it is on the Apple Watch, why is there absolutely no visual cue that there are additional functions hidden behind force touch?   Shit like this is, BY FAR, the most annoying thing about iOS."
apple,3dt9n6,JitteryPenguin,65,Sun Jul 19 14:44:58 2015 UTC,if you think IOS is unintuitive try finding anything on the 80 flavors of android. everything works different on every phone. does it have a home button? 3 soft buttons or 4? hard ware buttons or capacitive? It works differently on almost every handset.  I work in IT. I loathe when people bring me android phones when something is wrong because it takes twice as long as with iOS to find things.
apple,3dt9n6,Techsupportvictim,5,Sun Jul 19 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you, there are users for whom that info would be handy.  I just wish that they would take it out of the backed in system. They managed to have iCloud Drive as an option so why not some of these other things. They could have a 'new to iPhone' screen in the set up that offers to download said app or even iBooks and the guide book.   Then those that need it, have it, those that don't can not"

apple,3dt9n6,afrobat,-18,Sun Jul 19 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"I have tried the many flavors of Android. That does not necessarily have much to do with stock Android and does not take away from my main point whatsoever. Are you saying that if Android does not do it well means that it does not warrant Apple for making useability better in iOS?   Also, 4 soft buttons hasn't been a thing since gingerbread and more recent iterations using material design and Holo actually have visual indicators for software functions, which is what I am saying is an issue with iOS. It has nothing to do with the iPhone hardware. I really cannot think of any features within the Android stock apps that have hidden features to the extent that iOS has with the exception of Google Hangouts."
apple,3dt9n6,colinstalter,16,Sun Jul 19 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"Lol. There are some hidden features in iOS but this is mainly so that non-power users (like my parents) don't get overwhelmed with options and toggles. If you are someone who wants the advanced features they are only a tap/swipe away.   I admit there are some unintuitive things in iOS but it is still way easier to use than other mobile OSs. Just because apple is nice enough to put out a tips app with a handful of (mostly obvious) suggestions, that is no admission of guilt."
apple,3dt9n6,afrobat,-7,Sun Jul 19 15:05:16 2015 UTC,"Having advanced features being not hidden does not necessarily mean that it will confuse non-power users. Most of these features aren't exactly what I would call power user functions anyway. ""Add to Favorites"" isn't exactly something associated with power users, or just changing directions when taking a picture.   These are functions that could be better placed elsewhere or more prominently. Would it really cause a useability issue having the ""Add to Favorites"" button not hidden and just placed near your favorites? Or, as I saw in another phone (I don't remember which one), it said in the panorama prompt to move the phone left OR right with the picture starting in the center. Then as soon as you moved in one direction or the other, it eliminated the other direction as an option.   This is just an example. These layout of many of the apps can be improved greatly one way or the other without sacrificing useability. Everything I pointed out in my original post is something that is easily fixable without really affecting overall useability.   I admit I over-exaggerated a bit in that the Tips app may be useful. However, there are several functions within the ""Tips"" app that should not necessarily require a tip to figure out how it works if the software were merely just designed better."
apple,3dt9n6,captainserial,2,Sun Jul 19 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this philosophy Apple has been using of hiding advanced features, for the past 30 YEARS, is bad design! That's why they have a reputation for badly designed software! Shit, they better stop soon, or they'll go out of business!"

I appreciate them keeping the UI clutter to a minimum. I also don't mind spending a few minutes reading through the manual to find tips like this. Apple has literally been doing this for 20 years. If you ever get a chance to read a spiral bound user manual for Mac System 6 or 7 - they were stuffed with features and tips that you weren't presented during day to day use of the OS. And that, I think, is what made it great.   https://help.apple.com/iphone/8/#/iph1e767793c"
apple,3dt9n6,afrobat,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"I mean I guess if you liked the whole binder thing, but I feel we should have moved well beyond that by now. I felt that OS X does a fairly decent job of laying stuff out and making things easy to find (for the most part) with button layouts, search function, etc...  If we required a binder user manual for everything, it just makes me think of each program being laid out as a Microsoft Office program where you have to search the Internet every time you want to find a function. I just find that to be poor design.   I understand it would be difficult to stuff just the same amount of functionality into a mobile operating system, but I feel it is something that Apple could definitely strive more for within iOS."
apple,3dt9n6,TBaginz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:02 2015 UTC,"Why are there no visual cues for something like panorama direction switching?   Well I'd say the fact that the picture flies across the screen to the other side is pretty nice cue that you've switched directions.

apple,3dt9n6,Activedarth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"Because people aren't stupid.   On a serious note, most Apple users prefer the minimalistic design as compared to having everything written down. Most people can figure out what is what by simply playing around with their phones.   The tips app is terrible in providing tips that actually matter. But again, most people seem to figure out what to do.  FYI, iOS is by far the most cleanest OS on mobile phones. Android has too many unnecessary features which frankly, most people don't use/know about. Also, those Android skins by brands are terrible in keeping a consistency across the SAME OS.   Edit: Apple is global company. As a business, they cater to the majority, because profits. They did a lot with accessibility features. Most people are very happy with how iOS looks and plays. They can't and are definitely not looking to please all the 7 billion people in the world. At the end of the day, its all about the profits as a business should be."

Once in a while the notification on my watch just has a Dismiss button on it (it is supposed to also have an Authorize button to do the unlocking). I haven't seen this too often.

apple,3dw8l9,Chrisnness,-11,Mon Jul 20 05:52:35 2015 UTC,That seems so stupid. So developers can't test their beta's with users until the final release?   Whats the point of a 'public' beta?  edit: love getting downvoted for asking a question. welcome to reddit where discourse is discouraged and your opinion doesn't matter.
apple,3dw8l9,Drim498,15,Mon Jul 20 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"The developer beta isn't for developers to release apps to the public, it's for the developers to adapt the new tech to their apps. The public beta is for Apple to make sure their end of things work with new features, make sure they know for sure what range of machines the OS will run on, etc.  That being said, I believe developers are allowed to release beta apps using OS X beta features to test on, but I don't think they are allowed to release it to public beta user, only developer beta users (i.e. your hardware has to be registered with their developer account and all that.) I don't have a source at the moment, but if I recall correctly, that's how it works."

apple,3du7ay,Deedubau,4,Sun Jul 19 21:23:02 2015 UTC,"At this point I think the Air is only the right decision for a very very small market segment; That being:   Absolutely requires the portability compared to the Pro Absolutely requires the processing power compared to the MacBook   We're all apprehensive about going with lower processing power, but the truth is most things, even that power users are using their computers for is not that intensive, and with the fast SSD in the MacBook it will probably generally feel snappier than the Air."
apple,3du7ay,tdbutler,3,Sun Jul 19 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love my 11 inch air. I probably wouldn't recommend that size to anyone though, unless they tried it at an Apple store and feels the portability is nicer than the 13 inch. I also hook my air up to a bluetooth keyboard/trackpad/monitor on ocassion, I'm not sure if that's something you can do with the new Macbook though, but they do make an 80 dollar adapter that lets you plug more ports into it. The 13 inch air is a better value imo, but the new Macbook looks outstanding with the killer resolution and has ultra portability."

apple,3du7ay,Downhill280Z,5,Sun Jul 19 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"Right now, the fact that the Air still exists and that the MacBook is so expensive right now seems to be the main issue.   Most likely, the high cost of the MacBook is due to large R&D costs involved in the design, such as thinning the display and making it Retina, making the logic board so small, but relatively powerful, and simply making it so ridiculously small.   Remember how the original MacBook Air cost $1,800 when it released? This is the same thing. Once the Air is out the window and they use the things they've learned from the Air and MacBook, then the price will drop, probably back to $999."

Light as a feather, slower processor and smaller RAM run circles around my previous (decent, even) windows machine in terms of overall performance and speed. No one in their right mind can say this machine is not ultra portable, and the battery life simply rocks. Hell, even the MBP is still a very portable machine.   To me there are really only two viable options in the lineup still- need ultra portability and battery life with more than adequate processing power for most users? Go MBA. Need the extra processing power and the better screen for more detailed/ intensive work? Go MBP.   I think Apple seriously played anyone who fell for the new MB."

Awesome screen, awesome size and weight, but it's not exactly a speed demon. The screen is top notch, but this thing is underpowered today and it'll be heavily disadvantaged in the years to come. Again, not really future proof... I also hate the keyboard on this thing, but that's subjective.  The 2015 rMBP is a whole other story. Powerful, top notch screen, great battery life, and still light enough to lug around. It sacrifices a bit in the way of weight, but the advantages in power are huge.  It's a fantastic computer today, and it'll be fantastic tomorrow. It has force touch. It natively supports 60hz 4k external monitors too, something the new rMB can't do.

Id say that's probably almost fair for how many people actually use, somewhere around 2-3000, possibly up to 5000 but I couldn't imagine much more than that actually getting much use. You gotta remember that corporations often have their own apps that only those employees use, and there are many corporations. You've also gotta remember there are multiple countries in the world, each with popular services and games and sites that aren't popular here, or maybe don't even exist here. I think 5,000 is a safe bet factoring that in.   That doesn't mean out of the other 1,495,000 apps, they're all garbage. A lot are, people who are learning to make apps and decided to publish for shits and gigs, or people who are honestly trying to launch their app/business and don't do a very good job, but there are probably plenty of ""good"" apps that simply don't get exposure, don't provide a benefit that another popular app doesn't already provide, or just aren't anything needed or interesting, but are perfectly fine apps.

apple,3duwxb,tariqhmali,60,Sun Jul 19 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"The iPhone 4S is still supported 4 years after release and will probably stop receiving updates next year, with iOS 10. So if you apply that to the iPhone 5S, I suppose it will stop being supported in 2017/2018."

apple,3duwxb,Wisex,9,Sun Jul 19 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"Don't fall into the 'upgrade' trap. Just buy a phone off-contract whenever you it's right for you and your budget, and switch to a cheap plan, you'll save hundreds if not thousands of dollars over the long term."
apple,3duwxb,xavier86,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:44 2015 UTC,"That totally depends on your area though, right? In my area the ""second tier"" carriers with less expensive plans have horrible coverage. My options are Verizon and AT&T for ""good"" data speeds and reliable coverage. Not upgrading is just giving Verizon free money.  Edit: I should state that not upgrading is giving Verizon ""free money"" if you can find value in $200-$300 every two years for a new phone. I do."
apple,3duwxb,Forrax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:58 2015 UTC,I guess I should have a crack at a 4S battery replacement then.

apple,3duwxb,LobaltSS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:02:18 2015 UTC,"IIRC the 4S and the iPad 2 share the same SoC, so, they should run it equally well: actually, iPad2 should run it better since it's not underclocked as the iPhone is for the same SoC."

I do fully expect my iPad Air 2 to last for 4 years, though. Maybe longer. The hardware will remain overkill for the foreseeable future."

apple,3duwxb,drumminglooming,4,Mon Jul 20 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely. They're one of the few Windows machines worth buying. The water resistant keyboard is very snazzy, and mine has survived more than a few gulps of coffee."
apple,3duwxb,The_Pappy,5,Mon Jul 20 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is necessarily exclusive to ThinkPads, I had a cheap HP fall off my bike at 60km/h downhill, roll down the hill and bounce into a river, where I found it stuck under a bridge after an hour of searching. Dried it out and kept using it for another two years after that.  I also had a Sony that I used for eight years.  ThinkPads are certainly good though, I do think Lenovo make the best keyboards in the business in particular."

Apple make very reliable and high quality laptops but they are only fourth in overall reliability, Asus, Toshiba and Sony are ahead of them and Dell is only slightly behind. All of those brands make laptops substantially cheaper than the MacBook.  https://www.squaretrade.com/laptop-reliability-1109/  It's a complete myth that PCs are all junk, they are not."
apple,3duwxb,blorg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"Dude, Sony doesn't make laptops anymore, and modern Toshiba and Dell are more reliable, but still pretty horrible on the low end. As in, thick bulky computers using the simplest and most reliable components available at risk of usability. The Toshiba Satellite tablet I tried using might as well have had a resistive touchscreen, and the Dell a resistive trackpad. Both were well over an inch thick and incredibly cheap plastic. Horrible experience, but I guess I can understand it never breaking.   Oh, but I've actually had a soft spot for Asus. ROG is a good brand. I haven't used an Asus computer from the low end, ever, so I don't know how they do there."

apple,3duwxb,guru_matt,68,Mon Jul 20 06:37:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, given its 64-bit CPU, I think it will last just fine."
apple,3duwxb,CaptainShanks,-51,Sun Jul 19 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"You realize that 64-bit has nothing to do with speed, right?"
apple,3duwxb,xmnstr,28,Sun Jul 19 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"Slightly wrong. 64 bit means the amount of data that can be pushed through the buses is larger, this means more data can be pushed with an instruction. Sometimes when larger data types need to be used with 32 bit CPU's you will need to use extra cycles to push data into a memory address ready for the operation. 64 bit CPU's less cycles need to be used to push data into memory addresses so quicker time processing :)"
apple,3duwxb,naughty_ottsel,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"While it's certainly useful in some cases, it's absolutely not a general improvement. The big deal about these newer generation processors comes with other improvements."
apple,3duwxb,xmnstr,6,Sun Jul 19 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"That's why I said slightly wrong. 64 bit processors bring a lot of different improvements, but many of the improvements are minor. An individual improvement won't show the whole benefit. Altogether they do. But the speed didn't come just from a higher frequency"
apple,3duwxb,naughty_ottsel,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"Well 64bit ARM CPUs use ArmV8, which is a much faster instruction set. Additionally because 64bit is a different architecture it will likely be retained longer as they can just compile for it. They did this with OSX Lion"
apple,3duwxb,agloeRegrets,2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a computer science major taking an assembly language class in college, of course I do :P  I just meant that modern versions of iOS are going to be more optimized for the 64-bit instruction set, so the 5S will probably stick around with more snappiness than the 4S did with its 32-bit CPU."
apple,3duwxb,CaptainShanks,-14,Sun Jul 19 22:21:27 2015 UTC,Right.
apple,3duwxb,xmnstr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, no.  Theoretically, 64 bit may be slower, since there's more data to fling around.   But practically, yes. Going from 32 to 64 but is a natural jumping point. ARM (and ix86) had massively cleaned up internals that makes things run faster."
apple,3duwxb,biffbobfred,12,Mon Jul 20 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"Well, the original iPhone is still ""useable"" but you wouldn't want to use that. I think being supported is a good representation for it still being a generally ok experience when using the device."
apple,3duwxb,i4NDR3W,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"Well the battery will give up at some point and thats an 80 dollar ordeal if you go the apple route  Besides that developers and apples own apps now only support the latest version of ios, so if you arent on the latest release, youll lose the ability to download or update some apps, and they might stop working after a while like twitterbot/snapchat/etc. does"

A new phone on the other hand will run you at least $649, which is well over ten times the cost of a battery replacement."
apple,3duwxb,blorg,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:16:43 2015 UTC,4S is supported but it's worth mentioning you can't use an Apple Watch with it.
apple,3duwxb,Porzingod27,15,Sun Jul 19 21:07:14 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that people who own an Apple Watch are not the same people who would still be using a 4S.
apple,3duwxb,50Olol5,0,Mon Jul 20 01:22:31 2015 UTC,Why not? It's a solid device that works well. Even rich people don't upgrade if the product they're using still works. I'm sure many 4S users were caught off guard when the 4S didn't support the Watch
apple,3duwxb,Porzingod27,6,Mon Jul 20 02:53:33 2015 UTC,"It's just that an Apple Watch seems like a nice toy or accessory for your iPhone, and when your iPhone is already pretty old, it makes sense to upgrade the phone before buying the accessory."
apple,3duwxb,50Olol5,0,Mon Jul 20 04:04:19 2015 UTC,But the 4S doesn't feel old. Its design is probably the most timeless of all the iPhones.
apple,3duwxb,Porzingod27,5,Mon Jul 20 04:07:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's not my point. My point is that most people would upgrade their phones first (even if it's fairly new) before buying an accessory for a phone."
apple,3duwxb,50Olol5,-3,Mon Jul 20 04:08:47 2015 UTC,That doesn't make sense. People with a 5 wouldn't upgrade even though it's a 3-4 year old device.
apple,3duwxb,Porzingod27,2,Mon Jul 20 04:16:59 2015 UTC,I feel like the only person that did not like the 4S at all when I got it compared to all the others I've owned.
apple,3duwxb,plus1zero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be like 4S or die. Which one do you think has the best design? I think most people like the 4S because it had a ""solid"" ""premium"" feel. Buzzwords, I know but the glass back and aluminum band just felt the best to me. The newer ones feel so flimsy and cheap in comparison. I guess most people slap a case on it and never actually use the device by itself."
apple,3duwxb,Porzingod27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:29:03 2015 UTC,I personally think the black slate 5 is the sleekest looking phone ever made
apple,3duwxb,plus1zero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:46 2015 UTC,Really? I found the gray back rather jarring. I wonder why they toss in gray when solid black looks so much better. (Solid black back is also why 4S is more appealing imo)
apple,3duwxb,Porzingod27,17,Mon Jul 20 06:01:37 2015 UTC,I don't think that the more recent iPhones have a fixed support window anymore. They'll probably be supported for as long as the hardware is capable of running the OS (and the 64-bit processor in the 5S is a beast and not that much weaker than the one found in the iPhone 6).
apple,3duwxb,TimFL,7,Sun Jul 19 19:55:23 2015 UTC,"64-bit support is likely where they will draw the line in the future. 32 bit models will be dropped with a future version, and the 5S will make it past that threshold. 5/5C and below won't."
apple,3duwxb,tvtb,10,Mon Jul 20 03:46:29 2015 UTC,"It's almost as fast as a 6, probably a similar level of performance to the brand new iPod Touch.  So it'll be a decent device for a good while yet"
apple,3duwxb,bluescrn,10,Sun Jul 19 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"Performance is very similar to the iPhone 6, and Apple are talking about how future iOS versions will be optimised for performance on older devices. You have no reason to worry.  I can see myself sticking with my 5s for another 3 years."
apple,3duwxb,hampa9,9,Sun Jul 19 21:19:51 2015 UTC,"They're still selling both the 5s and the 5c so it'll be a long time yet. Four, five years?"
apple,3duwxb,WasterDave,3,Sun Jul 19 21:10:07 2015 UTC,"They'll probably stop selling the 5C this year. When they realease the 6S and 6S plus they are going to have 5 phones, 6S's, 6's, and 5S. Although I have a feeling they might stop selling the 6 plus and just keep the 6. Because it's going to be hard to justify a 6S and a one year old 6 plus both at 200 dollars. So the 5S will most likely be sold until the iPhone 7 is realeased and be supported in firmware until iOS 11 at the very least."
apple,3duwxb,mrmaster198,4,Sun Jul 19 22:00:48 2015 UTC,Don't say that....The 6+ is a gift from god for us giant screen lovers...
apple,3duwxb,trevors685,4,Sun Jul 19 22:22:44 2015 UTC,Stop selling doesn't mean no support. Just look at the iPhone 5...
apple,3duwxb,mrmaster198,4,Sun Jul 19 22:25:01 2015 UTC,"Still, hopefully they continue the Plus line.  It's exactly what people who are tempted to jump ship are asking for.  A great full and large 1080p screen, a giant battery, a great camera, and a buttery smooth OS.  All four of those are why I'm leaving Android."
apple,3duwxb,trevors685,6,Mon Jul 20 00:56:53 2015 UTC,Yeah dude they're not discounting the plus line. I just said they would stop selling the 6+ and just stick with the 6S+...
apple,3duwxb,mrmaster198,2,Mon Jul 20 01:25:36 2015 UTC,SHIT lol.  Read your first comment all wrong
apple,3duwxb,trevors685,3,Mon Jul 20 01:34:56 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that wants a 6C that is the size of the 5s?
apple,3duwxb,Nosrac88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:14:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I would rather it be a full-fledged iPhone and not just a ""C"" model, but I'm with you. I've been using the 6 since last September and it's okay, but it is too big to use comfortably in one hand. I thought I was fine with it, though, until I borrowed a friend's 5s the other day. I miss that size."
apple,3duwxb,CommitteeOfTheHole,0,Mon Jul 20 07:21:46 2015 UTC,I think they'll phase out the 5S before the 5C solely based on aesthetics.
apple,3duwxb,thehumantorch0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:50:14 2015 UTC,I personally find the 5s to be a better looking and fitting phone.

apple,3duwxb,tewdwr,5,Sun Jul 19 18:49:37 2015 UTC,I maintain that the 5s is a great phone. That 64 bit update was huge. My girlfriend still has mine as a hand-me-down. Great size too.
apple,3duwxb,poortographer,5,Sun Jul 19 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the iPhone 5 will stop being updated in 2016, giving the 5S until 2017 or 2018."
apple,3duwxb,pablo72076,7,Sun Jul 19 19:48:44 2015 UTC,"why wouldnt 5 be updated in 2016? 4S will get update this year, so in 2016 it should be 5's final update."
apple,3duwxb,Gondlon,4,Sun Jul 19 23:02:14 2015 UTC,What I meant is that the 5 gets its last update in 2016.
apple,3duwxb,pablo72076,6,Sun Jul 19 23:41:01 2015 UTC,I imagine that Apple wants to stop supporting phones without 64-bit CPUs.

apple,3duwxb,Tbhjr,2,Mon Jul 20 00:31:44 2015 UTC,"Haha! I also know someone who still uses a 3GS. Earlier today, while at work, I saw her texting, and I noticed it looked really old, maybe iOS 6? I'm not sure since my first iPhone was/is the 5s that I typed this on."
apple,3duwxb,caesurachris1,5,Mon Jul 20 06:45:39 2015 UTC,iPhone 5S introduced 64bit and Touch ID. That will soon be the baseline.   Typically the downfall of iPhones is the low RAM (and lack of VM paging to disk)  iPhone 5S will be supported for a couple years yet.
apple,3duwxb,RedditV4,0,Mon Jul 20 03:54:50 2015 UTC,Doesn't paging to disk kill performance more than just terminating background tasks?
apple,3duwxb,DylanFucksTurkeys,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:12 2015 UTC,And if you run out of processes to kill and still don't have enough room? You can't even do the foreground task because the kernel can't page to disk.

apple,3duwxb,Krewd,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:56:57 2015 UTC,"How many times have you replaced it and what have the issues been? Do you believe that, given the number of people who have the phone and use it without much issue (at least not requiring a replacement) and multiple replacements by yourself, that the issue might be beyond the actual hardware of the device?"
apple,3duwxb,chernickov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"The most recent return was the 4th time I've had it replaced. Beyond the hardware? That's getting deep.. I'm just a user of an iPhone and have been since the 3G. Problems on the 5 have ranged from the sleep button, to most recently the home button rotating around. That was actually really annoying. Took it into the store here in Shanghai and the genius pointed out to me that the back camera was pushed in. I have no problem replacing these and will keep doing it's hardware related."
apple,3duwxb,Krewd,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to hang on to my 5S until 6C or 7. It's running great and works with my Watch, and I'm spending very little time on my phone anyways. The iPad occupies the most of my time on devices."

I think it's likely Apple will be able to make the regular iPhone a little smaller with a combination of thinner bezels and other tweaks, but I think the odds are against them making a new 4"" device unfortunately. I would be happy with 4.2 - 4.3"" though, I think that's just about the ideal size.    I think you'll realistically be able to use the 5S without trouble for another 18-24 months. Beyond that, I wouldn't expect OS updates to work well.    My plan is to wait at least until the iPhone 6S. It doesn't look like Apple is going to give it the 1920x1080 res of the 6+ though, which is something I'd want if I am going to go to a larger phone (the 6+ is TOO large).    I may wind up keeping my 5S and waiting for the iPhone 7 in that case. I think the iPhone 7 for sure will be at least a little smaller than the 6 and I think 1920x1080 is almost certain at that point (I hope!)"
apple,3duwxb,brigadier_lethbridge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"In terms of being compatible with iOS and most apps, probably iOS 10, maybe 11 (or whatever they're called). But in terms of app performance, it'll probably start after the 6S becomes widespread."
apple,3duwxb,aldrinjtauro,0,Sun Jul 19 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"I would probably say around the release time of the iPhone 7.. So probably September, 2016. The 4S is still supported years laster, and I know of people who still use one.... By supported, I mean it works, not necessary that it works well."

apple,3dxntr,maricc,2,Mon Jul 20 11:35:11 2015 UTC,"If your carrier says you used more than your iPhone, then perhaps you reset it the wrong day?  If it's the opposite then it's because your iPhone is reporting data that the carrier doesn't count."
apple,3dxntr,superezfe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"I've always had issues with the usage calculator on iOS. When I take the grand total and start subtracting the breakdowns from it, even the math is wrong. And by quite a bit. The total shown is actually higher than the breakdown adds up to. So either it's way over estimating, or something not listed is being thrown into the total. But that problem, if anything, would put you over on the phone before you're over with your carrier.  I did notice 'messages' under 'system services' uses a lot of data, especially if you're pushing them to other iDevices. Are you SMS forwarding to a bunch of other devices? Apple states there may be carrier charges for that. I'm not sure why or how, but it's been said. Perhaps the penalty is in the form of data. At any rate, I probably wouldn't trust the usage calculator until they pay some more attention to it over at Apple.  Can you set warnings or hard caps on usage at the carrier level? I do this with Ting."

apple,3dx2ea,astropolish,2,Mon Jul 20 06:31:50 2015 UTC,I played with my friend's 6 Plus and I realised it's actually not as big as I was expecting; I could definitely use the extra screen space in daily life.
apple,3dx2ea,tacocatmewyum,3,Mon Jul 20 07:09:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Me, my sister-in-law and her husband all bought the 6 plus originally and have all come to the conclusion that it is a pain in the arse having such a big and heavy phone. I swapped mine within the first 10 days so didn't get charged, and they're in the process of selling on eBay to swap.   I would highly recommend trying to spend more time with the plus before you commit to a swap."
apple,3dx2ea,JXChain,2,Mon Jul 20 10:46:29 2015 UTC,"Same as this comment.   I went from a Samsung S5, to a Note 4, after wanting a bigger phone for media use and general day to day things.  After a while I swapped it and grabbed a iPhone 6.  The size was great on the bigger phone, but things that annoyed me were:  -Too big to fit in jean pockets. And if it fit it wouldn't be able to sit a a chair at the bar  -Felt too big when using it at the gym, and for running with it and doing exercise  Hope this helps :)   You could purchase a 6+ and try it out before the 10 day trade back"

apple,3dx2ea,shibby3230,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:05:05 2015 UTC,"Another small factor was that the 6 Plus sold out immediately, whereas the 6 was available, and my 3GS was on its last legs (smashed screen, non-functional home button) so I was itching for a replacement. Sounds dumb now, I know. But the iPhone 6 is a GREAT phone. I just now think the 6 Plus might suit me better. Do you think it'd just be easier at this point to stick with the 6 and get the Plus model in two or three years?"
apple,3dx2ea,w1_m2,2,Mon Jul 20 12:11:49 2015 UTC,I have the 6 plus and my advice is to stick with the 6 for now. The current 6 plus is sluggish due to the lack of RAM and the higher resolution. My music even stutters sometimes when I am using safari. Simply unacceptable   Simply go to macrumors forum and you will see all the discussions on this. I plan to sell this phone as soon as the 6S plus comes out.
apple,3dx2ea,epik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I got to agree with this. Stick with the 6 for now until the 6S Plus is out. The current 6+ is really just not the fastest phone out there at the moment. The lack of RAM on it is really bad - it lags and stutters. I wish I had waited another year for the 6S+ instead of purchasing the 6+ at release.  I compare it to my iPad Air 2 which has 2GB of RAM, and that thing is a beast with no lag whatsoever."
apple,3dx2ea,tacocatmewyum,2,Mon Jul 20 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"At this time, you are better off waiting for the 6s and selling your current phone at that time. If you went 10 months already, wait another 2 for the new phone."

You're mainly paying for a router, so I'm not sure if it's worth buying them in multiples, but it's an option. Gramofon - $60 and advertises what you're looking for with multi room play, but without AirPlay yet. If you're after streaming a specific service this looks cool, but no AirPlay may be a deal breaker. However they've made considerable improvements and changes since I first took notice of their Kickstarter, so who knows what can come in an update. Rocki - the cheaper cousin to Gramofon, I actually ordered one of these but it hasn't arrived. Billed as a simple AirPlay and Spotify Connect device, it doesn't say it strictly supports multiple Rockies at the same time, but if you AirPlay from iTunes it should work exactly the same way as the AirPort Express would. Raspberry Pi Musicbox - I built one of these guys for about $70 when all was said and done, but it's a pretty robust system if you're into a more DIY method."

Is there a way for me to pair these.    You can either split the audio cable so the two are both connected to the same Airport Express, or you can use multiples and Airplay to multiple sources at the same time with iTunes. Note: The iOS airplay doesn't let you pick multiple sources, you can only do that if using iTunes."

I'd sure appreciate a bump from 5 to 15-20GB in iCloud (or 5-10 per device instead of per account, since after all Apple makes profit on hardware first and foremost).

I don't have a ton of apps, only a little music (less than 3 GB) and fewer photos than most people I know. I don't know where it all went, but if I had a 16 GB phone I would be close to the point of needing to delete things already.    IMO 16 GB is the absolute bottom of the barrel for people who literally don't use their phone for music, take few pictures and don't play games. Every single person I know with a 16 GB iPhone is constantly griping about needing to delete photos to make room and sighing because they can't download a new app. 16 GB is just silly at this point and shame on Apple for the dirty little trick to push people into the higher priced option. It might be different if they offered the 16 GB model at a steep discount or it were only in a super budget decontented 5C or something. In a supposedly premium, high-end phone with this price tag it's just insulting quite frankly. I wish people would stop making excuses for Apple on this issue."

apple,3dtree,hxcjonez,5,Sun Jul 19 11:34:51 2015 UTC,"Lady at the Apple Store was also wrong. The UK and EU laws that apply in the UK do not warranty anything for six years just cause it brought. The law is actually that you go back to the seller with proof that they sold you a shit item with a default and make them fix it  The reason why she didn't do that is cause it's generally not worth it to raise a fuss when someone drops mention of the consumer laws. It's not worth the yelling etc that you could start up, it's not worth the legal fees to take you to court and make you prove your case. Apple knows this and has told the managers this.   So unless you are trying to bring in a 5.75 year old computer that   -- has never had a single reported issue and you demand that you get a free brand new computer  -- has physical damage to the unit that they can say 'it is more likely you broke it dropping it all the time'   -- they have multiple diags to said part that show that it was functioning for years with no issue  They will mentally say 'fuck it' and go the cheap, lazy and drama free route of just covering it if you bring up those laws. Stories are generally too busy to deal with teaching you what the law really says or to deal with you decide to have a screaming fit like the woman in LA that got video taped by another customer and spread all over you tube.  The reason why she implied that is because it's also not worth their time to train the staff who won't be getting into the issue anyway what the law does and doesn't say. They just give them a set of rules and if it fits, cover it. If it doesn't, get a manager (say like if it wasn't bought in the UK or at an Apple Store so a receipt would be needed to prove at least UK purchase)"
apple,3dtree,jimicus,4,Sun Jul 19 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"I did buy it from the Apple Store, I went in for a diagnosis and fix fully expectant to pay for anything it may have been.

So having bought from apple, took to apple the lady said, Right, this law says this, we will fix it for free.  No demands, no threat of a fuss, they suggested the free fix etc.  So in my eyes, the law and apple do it that way because I have no reason to believe anything else."
apple,3dtree,Crash_Revenge,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:08 2015 UTC,I think the thinking is that any item you buy in the UK should be manufactured well enough that with considerate usage it will survive 6 years of use. If not the manufacturer has to replace it.
apple,3dtree,bottomlines,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"Incorrect.  The law says items must be fit for purpose. Essentially, the purchase of an item is a contract between you and the seller, and an implied term that the law puts in there is that it's not going to pack up on you six weeks down the line.  The statute of limitations for contract law is six years - hence why that's the time usually banded around when people talk about consumer law. But that doesn't mean something has to last for six years - you wouldn't expect your cars oil filter to last six years. Just means it has to last a ""reasonable"" length of time.  After six months, the onus is on the buyer to prove the issue was present from day 1.  You go back to, say, PC World after 5.5 years and let me know how you get on. Clue: You'll have to sue, and you'll probably lose."
apple,3dtree,jimicus,2,Sun Jul 19 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"Genuine question: if there is no accidental damage or evidence to suggest it, can you not argue that there must have been a manufacturer defect? How else can they suggest say a motherboard broke? If it's by law, to survive 6 years then other than an accident or deliberate damage what would they blaim?"
apple,3dtree,quinn_drummer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:16:04 2015 UTC,"They have to allow for normal wear and tear. Of course everything will eventually break. Which is why it is phrased as 'fit for purpose'. It all hinges on the product itself. If you buy a budget plastic £300 POS laptop, it is expected to last less time than a £2600 MacBook Pro which is marketed based on high quality, professional use etc."
apple,3dtree,hxcjonez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"It is not to survive 6 years by law, stop thinking that. Otherwise I could keep the pint of milk in my fridge for and demand a refund 5.5 years later.  And it's not the retailers problem how it broke; it's yours to prove it was defective from the factory. Easy when 10,000 other people report an identical problem, otherwise rather hard."
apple,3dtree,hxcjonez,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"Your edit is partially right. You have 6 years to claim, that if a product is faulty, is was sold with that fault, or that a fault at the time of purchased lead to the problem you have having up to 6 years later. Something very hard to prove 3,4,5 years down the line. I suspect that Apple are a bit more willing to give customers the benefit of the doubt than most manufacturers and retailers are"
apple,3dtree,hxcjonez,4,Sun Jul 19 12:13:08 2015 UTC,"Totally, Like I said, I didn't even know about this law until the apple lady said in a suggestive way that I mentioned the law and that it's covered under it.  £600 saved! a happy boy left the store!"

It's $66 on Amazon and Prime eligible.   This won't work with any case I've ever owned, so I bought an Incipio Edge case for my iPhone 6.

apple,3dw6nz,flaw600,4,Mon Jul 20 01:13:27 2015 UTC,"Apple has made estimations on who buys the different size watches and who will buy the bands.  They figure that few 42mm watch owners will want to buy the modern buckle, as that size is more likely to be bought by men, and that buckle is more likely to be bought by women.  The interesting question is if they are correct. The current lineup is from before the watch went on sale. I know the 42mm is selling much better and therefore must be purchased by a large amount of women."

apple,3dup9t,colinstalter,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"when they iron out the few issues with it    This is the problem...  Which are the issues?  It's smaller than, say... my Omega Speedmaster (a normal sized watch for todays standards), and much smaller than the typical watch sold by fashion brands you find at your mall.  The battery lasts enough for you don't have to care about it (always lasts you a day, normally lasts 2 days, even with normal use).  It has many kinks ironed out from what Apple has learned from previous smartwatches, like the ability to quickly change straps, which is very important when you have to use the watch in your office and in your gym (you can't use a leather band there), or the digital crown, a very small and precise scroll wheel that makes scrolling usable in a such small screen, the vibration motor that's silent and doesn't feel like an electrical discharge (it's a linear actuator in fact), and the small speaker that's loud enough for use (when you are in a silent place, at least), or the ability to be a device so easy to recharge, it doesn't bother you, because it has a lot of ""give"" because it's magnetic attached, so you can still charge it overnight, and you won't get problems when you exercise you watch before going to bed and charge it (because it's wireless charged, means that there are no exposed contacts, meaning that water from your sweat, and believe, a watch back gets sweaty, meaning that you won't short circuit it because of that).  Some say that it needs a GPS.  I think needs as much a GPS as my car needs a GPS, not at all, because nobody is going hiking, e.g. without a phone for emergencies. At it can accurately measure distance you ran.  Some say that it needs to work without a phone.  This is why the Galaxy Gear S has been such an huge success, right? Face it, the smartphone is here to stay, it has a great camera, it can browse the real internet and display it onscreen, costumers wanted a screen bigger screen even, and are always asking for more battery life, greater Apps with more complexity... so, where does a small device as a watch fits there? And how are you supposed to make calls in privacy (not everyone listening to your speakerphone) with a watch?  Also, since it needs to be bulkier not only for the radio and more battery to operate it, but to have the dreaded SIM card tray, and how are you supposed to work with it? Taking out of your phone and taking it to your watch, and back every time*... really counter-productive, bringing your phone seems more reasonable altogether, and not saying that most carriers charge you a good fee for a second twin SIM card. I have a friend that returned his Gear S for this problem...  What the Apple Watch really needs is more medical sensors that aren't available now, and more places to use Apple Pay."

I know this is going to be fixed with WatchOS 2, but that's exactly part of what OP means. I can't wait for all this polish. I'm sure I'll hop on by WatchOS 3."

Apple didn't bother trying because their designers have enough taste to know this and didn't bother trying.   That doesn't mean it won't mature to where you can manage without the trade offs the Galaxy causes, though I expect that's still quite a ways away.   Nobody expects the smartwatch to replace the smartphone for everything. But it would sure be nice if I felt like I could leave the house most of the time and not need he phone in my pocket. I'd be happy to have a phablet that I keep when I plan on needing it and just stick to bare communication functions and quick lookups the rest of the time.   As for taking without speakerphone, wireless earpieces exist and are getting better all the time. I expect if people are going without phones they'd have them most of the time for music and such anyway."

Basically none of the information shared here is something Apple talks about, at all. XNU itself is only mentioned as part of a path in an old outdated kernel building document, I'm not even sure if OSX even allows that anymore.  Most information that Apple does share when it comes to details and technical information, tend to be locked behind the requirement of a dev account or even an NDA. You don't know what other companies do, so you have nothing to compare Apple's dedication towards the community is. The fact is that they CONSTANTLY ignore their own forums, NEVER interact with the community and even attack community member who do thing with their devices that fall out of their vision for it. (eg. ""jailbreaking is illegal!"")   If you think Apple is dedicated to the community, you should see Google. From open developer documents, detailed dev videos, tons of active Googlers on their support forums and bug trackers and even some on reddit, tons of open source projects that they create purely for the community.

I don't see the Google Store giving free service on devices, free workshops for people who need some more assistance, and field trips for the younger generation to learn about tech and how it works.   The first two are customers relations at best, no community if you ask me. they just made $400 on your purchase, they should at least take 30 min to show you how to use it.  I have never heard of field trips of any kind ever, never even heard of campus tours at Apple.

apple,3dwmtn,GiovannyLira,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:50:12 2015 UTC,In iOS 9 the new feature handoff lets you resume apps on other devices through iCloud. If I disable it on my phone will another device on my iTunes account still be able to resume my apps from my phone?
apple,3dwmtn,cududwd,4,Mon Jul 20 03:53:37 2015 UTC,"Still confused. You're asking if the iOS 8 feature called ""Handoff"" will still work if you turn it off?"
apple,3dwmtn,CirqueKid,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:15:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought it was iOS 9 as I haven't seen it before I updated, but what I'm asking is if MY apps can be resumed on other devices if I turn it off. I know I won't be able to resume others' apps but what I'm wondering is if other devices on my iCloud account can resume the apps on my phone if the setting is on for them but off for me."
apple,3dwmtn,cududwd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"The easiest way is to just try it yourself and see, since it's been a feature for a while. However think of it like this: If you have 3 phones and want to call one another, if you turn one off you cannot make or receive calls. You can still do it on the devices turned on, but if it's off, it's off.   Handoff works like this but with sending data from one device to another. If you ""close the gates,"" data will not be able to be sent instantaneously with a swipe or double tap, BUT it will still sync with iCloud the standard way if that is a feature.  Personally I find handoff useful and unobtrusive, is there a reason you're trying to shut it off?"
apple,3dwmtn,GiovannyLira,2,Mon Jul 20 10:54:57 2015 UTC,"Getting closer...  As I understand it, you're asking not about ""your"" and ""other"" apps, since they all have to be signed into your single account for any of this to work. You need to have the same app on both devices (or I think someone mentioned something about handoff to websites in iOS 9, that's new).   What you're asking then is if the switch disables both handoff TO and handoff FROM the device, or if the switch disables just handoff TO the device?"
apple,3dwmtn,rnawky,0,Mon Jul 20 04:27:01 2015 UTC,Both handoff to and from. Sorry that I made it complicated.
apple,3dwmtn,cududwd,4,Mon Jul 20 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"Handoff does not work through iCloud, it authenticates both devices through iCloud, but the devices must be on the same wifi network for Handoff to work. If you deactivate Handoff on your device it won't resume your activity from other devices."

apple,3dv2bp,D2Saint,6,Mon Jul 20 00:27:48 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure, I have never owned a Mac but I do have a lot of experience building PCs. The main difference between the i5 and the i7 is hyper threading. All processors available in the 13 inch MacBook pro are dual core, however the hyper threading in the i7 allows the two physical cores to act as four logical cores. It is NOT the same as a true quad core processor but I can drastically improve performance is heavily hyper threaded programs. The actual clock speed difference between the i5 and i7 is slim, almost negligible. All in all, an i7 will probably make your MacBook last a little longer before it feels slow. However it is worth remembering a full spec 13 inch model is about the same price as a base model 15 inch. If the extra screen real estate is tempting for your it's worth considering. Hope that helps!  Edit- As /u/KillerEyeDoc mentioned the i5 utilized in the 2015 MacBook pro does support hyper threading, which is out of the ordinary for i5 processors.  That being said, the clock speed is the key difference and it may be worth saving the money and sticking with a lower tier i5."
apple,3dv2bp,cmclewin,3,Sun Jul 19 19:36:30 2015 UTC,To add to this about the speed difference of the i5s - negligible. You will see an increase in performance for your video/photo editing going from i5 to i7 but not really from adding 200MHz.

apple,3dv2bp,EscapeArtistic,4,Sun Jul 19 19:56:13 2015 UTC,May I ask why upgrading RAM would benefit more than processor? I'm not too techy so would appreciate all the knowledge I can get!
apple,3dv2bp,WorldsSleepiestTAway,9,Sun Jul 19 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"RAM will be used for everything, and will speed up most daily tasks, a processor bump will increase performance on processor intensive tasks like rendering, but if you don't have a lot of memory this advantage gets negated by the simple fact that to process stuff, it has to be in memory.   Thus if you don't have enough memory, it needs to swap out to the disk and back into memory.  So on all tasks, and even on processor intensive tasks, if the task doesn't fit in memory, the slight increase in processor speed is wasted.  I think on a lot of tasks the same spec macbook with slower processor and 16GB will outperform the the faster processor with 8GB of ram.  Also this is the same reason I think an SSD upgrade is in order, because if you've got big files, the bottleneck will be disk access. If you start using externals you're losing all the benefits of a fast system."
apple,3dv2bp,EscapeArtistic,5,Sun Jul 19 20:23:59 2015 UTC,"crispy speaks wisely. Whenever someone comes into my store and is on a budget, i always tell them to prioritize ram. I almost always suggest this on the Air's if someone really wants one and is willing to wait for the custom build.   The only time you're gonna really see a difference between an i5 and an i7 is if you're doing work that requires rendering, as many people have already stated. But storage and ram are better to prioritize for longevity.   The pros are great laptops, though. you treat her well and she'll last you at least 6 years"

apple,3dsvv9,hansnofranz,32,Sun Jul 19 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"You can store up to 2GB of music directly on the watch. I believe there is offline storage for Apple Music, not sure about Spotify tho. Yes your iPhone can be connected to both bluetooth headphones and your Apple Watch at the same time. But if you want to go running without your phone you can connect your bluetooth headphones directly to the watch and listen to music that way. The main downside to running without your phone is that you wouldn't be able to GPS track your run since the watch doesn't have GPS built in, but you would still be able to listen to music, monitor your heart rate, calories burned, distance traveled etc without the phone."
apple,3dsvv9,shibby3230,6,Sun Jul 19 04:19:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info it's a huge help. I can live without the GPS, I tend to run the same routes so I already know my distances. Do you know if the heart rate monitoring is now being implemented into the nike running app? What about sleep monitoring?"
apple,3dsvv9,shibby3230,6,Sun Jul 19 04:52:20 2015 UTC,"As far as I know Apple currently does not allow third party apps to access the Watch's heart rate sensor so I don't think it will work with the Nike app but maybe they'll change that in the future.  As for sleep monitoring, I haven't really heard of any apps that do that for the watch yet. However, I always charge my watch every night (you kind of have to if you want to have enough battery to make it through the next day) so I wouldn't want to wear it for sleep tracking unless it could also be charging at the same time which would probably be pretty uncomfortable without some kind of charging case for the watch which is something you need to spend more money on...  lol I hope you see my point   But yeah there are already apps like Sleep Cycle out there that can use your iPhone to monitor sleep so I would probably just use that instead."
apple,3dsvv9,quintsreddit,12,Sun Jul 19 05:07:10 2015 UTC,WatchOS 2 allows them to get heart rate data.

apple,3dsvv9,beckerola,0,Sun Jul 19 14:34:32 2015 UTC,"The  sleep monitoring is tied to the heart rate monitor. A lot can be learned about the quality of your sleep with a heart rate monitor. I'm a light sleeper myself, I probably wake about 5-6 times a night. It's hard to tell how much quality sleep I'm getting."

apple,3dsvv9,Zarabrath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:52:52 2015 UTC,Sort of. All of the sleep monitoring stuff I believe was being hyped by Apple's Health Kit. I may have just assumed that the Apple Watch would be implemented for this. Many other fitness watches are geared towards this. I'm wondering if it's something Apple removed because of battery life.
apple,3dsvv9,kirklennon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, you could be right. my garmin forerunner 225 has gps, an always-on display and heart rate monitor and it goes for weeks on a single charge. i guess for fully comprehensive health analysis it does need to include sleep as you said. it's a very important aspect of health."
apple,3dsvv9,kirklennon,11,Mon Jul 20 08:04:48 2015 UTC,That's actually pretty dope. Bummer without gps but otherwise that's cool.
apple,3dsvv9,kirklennon,17,Sun Jul 19 04:38:50 2015 UTC,"Bummer without gps but otherwise that's cool.   If you go on a run once with your phone, it calibrates your stride and can them calculate distance without the phone on subsequent runs. I tested it a few times on known distances and it was 95%+ accurate."
apple,3dsvv9,ex-apple,3,Sun Jul 19 04:56:09 2015 UTC,I'm hoping on the heart rate tracking being a better indicator of calories burned than the traditional method of time and distance. I probably would have gotten the Apple Watch on day one if the feature was available.
apple,3dsvv9,1st_thing_on_my_mind,5,Sun Jul 19 06:02:33 2015 UTC,I'm a little confused. Which feature are you talking about? It already does track your heart rate.
apple,3dsvv9,ShawnMac86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:11:04 2015 UTC,I believe the heart monitor hardware still hasn't been opened up to third part developers. I'm still waiting for that feature to be brought into the Nike Running app.
apple,3dsvv9,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"Not directly, but it the Nike Running app can read heart rate data from HealthKit. Is the issue that the heart rate data needs to be live in the app? Sorry, I don’t use Nike Running so I’m not quite sure."
apple,3dsvv9,beckerola,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:48 2015 UTC,I think that's the issue here. I haven't been able to find much good information on this. It seems the heart rate monitor has yet to opened up to third parties. I can totally be wrong here but I think all that can currently be done with the heart rate monitor is tell you your current heart rate. Oh and I guess there's that stupid feature where you can send your heartbeat to another iPhone user. Why Apple made that a priority over some other features blows my mind.
apple,3dsvv9,kirklennon,4,Sun Jul 19 18:33:51 2015 UTC,HR is definitely a better indicator. And the watch can definitely do that on its own.
apple,3dsvv9,ekeen1,2,Sun Jul 19 14:29:49 2015 UTC,the HRM on the watch is very near accurate to a chest strap. Even in the pool. it uses the HR and age/weight to determine calorie burn just as most monitors do.

apple,3dsvv9,williagh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:40:19 2015 UTC,That doesn't look like anything I've seen before. I don't recognize it from HealthKit.

apple,3dsvv9,williagh,12,Sun Jul 19 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"I actually ran today with mine. /u/shibby3230 did a great job explaining, but you can't have offline storage for Spotify on the watch because they don't have a watch app. Yet.  Overall it's a nice thing to run with. A fantastic extension of your phone, with its own capabilities, like the heartrate sensor. But unlike the MS Band's, the heartrate sensor is one of the watch's only fitness features. A few downsides for the watch, too:   lack of GPS so no mapping without phone, but you can calibrate distance. kind of a hassle to mess with music or see past notifications or access any kind of glances or notification since you can't access them in the workout app. workouts can be a bit of a battery hog, but I guess you could turn off auto heartrate to save battery if you want to track any other type of fitness not in the workouts app, you have to get a third party app I'm not quite sure it knows I've stopped to walk"
apple,3dsvv9,WinterCharm,3,Sun Jul 19 04:45:39 2015 UTC,But offline storage does work with Apple Music then? I'm not too concerned with battery life. Ideally I would like to  use the watch for running and sleep monitoring. In my work life I have no cellular or wifi access so the other features are pretty much useless.
apple,3dsvv9,NEDM64,3,Sun Jul 19 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Press ""save for offline"" or whatever it says. And add it to a playlist you have synced with your watch."
apple,3dsvv9,WinterCharm,2,Sun Jul 19 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"As an owner of Apple Watch, it's no good for sleep monitoring. You're much better off with apps like Sleep Cycle Alarm on your iPhone. The watch doesn't have any built in functionality for sleep tracking. What was very disappointing for me, is that Health.app actually has Sleep Analysis option, but the Watch doesn't provide any data for it."
apple,3dsvv9,WinterCharm,2,Sun Jul 19 20:15:28 2015 UTC,That is disappointing. I think I assumed this would be one of the Watch's features. I must have watched the Health Kit keynote and assumed all of it was a precursor to the Apple Watch.
apple,3dsvv9,NEDM64,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:20 2015 UTC,Apple may add sleep tracking for it   Health.app has it because there are some very good sleep tracking apps in the App Store that do store that data there.

Here   can you store music directly on the watch?   up to 2GB offline storage (that can be Apple Music files or not), or all your music that your iPhone has, can access Apple Music.   Will my iPhone six simultaneously connect with an Apple Watch and Bluetooth headphones?   Yes   What I'm really looking for is a fitness watch that stores music offline, with heartrate monitoring that doesn't need to be accompanied by my phone.    Only one choice then   Do any decent smart watches on the market support offline music storage?   AFAIK, no."
apple,3dsvv9,chowderchow,2,Sun Jul 19 22:20:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm really surprised Spotify hasn't offered a decent smartwatch app with one of Apple's competitors. Looks like I'll be sticking with Apple and this may be the death nail for my Spotify account.
apple,3dsvv9,NEDM64,2,Sun Jul 19 22:49:28 2015 UTC,Why do you think the Apple Watch is limited to 2GB of offline storage? Why's Apple being so conservative?
apple,3dsvv9,williagh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"It only has eight gigs of memory.  It's also not primarily for listening to music in a controlled high-quality environment  Sound quality does not matter as much when you're running and moving around, because much of the detail is lost because the interfering sounds (footsteps, you moving) makes it impossible to hear the details. Thus, with lower bit rate files 2GB is enough."
apple,3dsvv9,NEDM64,3,Sun Jul 19 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, audio fidelity is overrated when running. I'm the same way with running headphones. I'll take a durable pair of headphones that sound ok over an expensive pair that goes to shit after 3 months. I must have gone through about 10 pairs of wired Bose sport headphones. Bose replaced them every time with no issue, but I grew tired of making the trip to the Bose store. I've had a pair of BlueAnt Pump Headphones now for about 9 months, they're very durable. You can even wear them in the shower. But the audio is mediocre, but good enough for running.  But I am curious if the 2GB limit is put there to prevent piracy. Like the same reason Apple Music isn't compatible with non iOS iPods."
apple,3dsvv9,TBoneTheOriginal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"How will you pirate music? Getting it off the apple watch is a bitch and a half, though.   Sure you can move music there... and keep listening to it... but that's about it."
apple,3dsvv9,SaneBRZ,2,Sun Jul 19 23:49:04 2015 UTC,I agree. I don't know if it's the record labels that are against it or what? This has been on going for years. When I originally signed up for Spotify I was excited that I could use it with my ipod nano. The desktop Spotify software allows you to mount your ipod but then is only capable of managing music onto your ipod that's already in your iTunes library. I never understood the point of this feature since I couldn't load any offline Spotify music. I think the labels have gotten more lenient but there's still some hurdles.
apple,3dsvv9,williagh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of ""think"", it's there.  Apple doesn't want you to run out of space because you have your device filled up with photos or music... I Think..."
apple,3dsvv9,SaneBRZ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry, should have been more clear. I was more curious about your opinion on the 2GB limit after having used the Apple Watch. Curious to know how much the OS uses."
apple,3dsvv9,williagh,5,Sun Jul 19 23:24:52 2015 UTC,"The hardware is fine and it has bags of potential. It is better to ask this question in a couple of months when the phone and watch update their OS's, which will greatly enhance 3rd party apps on the watch.  Currently it's ok as a fitness tracker and if you use Apple Music then you can get away with using it in the gym as a phone substitute as well.  For outdoor running it's terrible. The native app is too inaccurate for purpose. The 3rd party apps are too slow updating when your raise your wrist. Come back in a few months and it will be a different story entirely."
apple,3dsvv9,SaneBRZ,3,Sun Jul 19 13:40:27 2015 UTC,Thanks. This is the advice I'm looking for. I think I'll sit tight until and wait for the updates. But I think Apple is the one closest to having this all figured out. I've been researching other watches as well and was surprised by the lack of music features.
apple,3dsvv9,NEDM64,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's the best fitness tracker I have ever used, but it's still not quite where I'd like it to be :)  Here's how it stacks up to Garmin's dedicated running watch: https://twitter.com/hverlind/status/592249808972288000"

I've been running and working out before smartwatches came around, and having one really doesn't make all that much of a difference to me.   I still do most of my music listening from my phone and while it's nice to be able to switch tracks from my watch, the controls on the earphones work just as well. In my opinion, from a fitness standpoint it is completely useless.   Sure, heart rate and step counter information are nifty and all but there's really not much I'd do with that information but say ""Huh, that's cool."" Not to mention that the step counters in smartwatches are still very inaccurate at this point. A lot of features that come close to being useful require it to be paired to your phone, and if you're going running with your phone you might as well do away with the watch anyway.   Don't get me wrong, it's a great device but not all too useful if fitness is your thing.  EDIT: I have to clarify that this all is in my own opinion."
apple,3dsvv9,PairOfMonocles2,2,Sun Jul 19 12:24:41 2015 UTC,"I'm of the same opinion. I want to get a watch so I can leave my phone at home, I don't want to carry more hardware with me.

apple,3dtcis,hamsterkun,16,Sun Jul 19 06:53:09 2015 UTC,Almost certainly ( except they'll both be there in a single port ) Thunderbolt 3 is supposed to use the USB C connector  https://thunderbolttechnology.net/blog/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-does-it-all  The only question is whether it'll be in a MBP of 2015 or 2016 .
apple,3dtcis,AkeleHumTum,2,Sun Jul 19 07:35:12 2015 UTC,I'd say 2016 or rather 2017

apple,3dtcis,DondeEstaLaDiscoteca,8,Sun Jul 19 22:30:08 2015 UTC,"Given that Thunderbolt 3 which was recently validated by Intel uses the USB type C connector and that Apple has yet to incorporate the latest Intel processors which promise better battery life in their Macbook lineup, I'd venture that the next iteration of at least the Macbook Pro will incorporate both.  If we're really lucky Apple will turn all of the ports on the MacBook Pros into Type-C USB 3/Thunderbolt ports instead of 2x USB 3 and 2x TB3.   Anyhoo, my money is on 2016."
apple,3dtcis,dfmz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:27:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't know about the new thunderbolt 3. Given the transfer rate of the new thunderbolt, I hope Apple will replace all thunderbolt 2 and usb ports in 2016 macbook to thunderbolt 3!"
apple,3dtcis,ThePegasi,4,Sun Jul 19 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about TB3 is that it's both TB and USB 3.1 buses in a single connector. So instead of having, say, 2 TB ports and 3 USB ports, they could just have 4 or 5 TB3 ports which would support all devices."
apple,3dtcis,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:29:35 2015 UTC,I figure they would leave a few of the older ports around because otherwise all the adapters people would have to buy for their old gear.
apple,3dtcis,ThePegasi,4,Sun Jul 19 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"Well I think it depends on uptake. Bear in mind we're talking about the company that put one single USB C connector on the new MB. Of all OEMs, they're the one that push adoption of new standards (at least those in which they have a vested interest) with the most zeal.  I could easily see them simply standardising the new connector even on MBPs once TB3 comes out, though at the same time I wouldn't rule out maybe a single USB 3.1 A connector. No more than that, though."
apple,3dtcis,ikkei,0,Sun Jul 19 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'd retain a non-USB-C connector. 3 USB-C (remember, you can daisy chain TB) would be more than enough for most MBP users, Apple may slot 2 on each side (4 total) to be on the safe/user-friendly side.  iirc, USB 3.x to USB-C is just a matter of slot/plug shape, isn't it? If so, then it's just a matter of a physical adapter, there's no chip involved so it's bound to be just as easy-and-cheap as any DVI/HDMI or jack/RCA adapter. If not, then please ignore this comment."
apple,3dtcis,ThePegasi,4,Sun Jul 19 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"iirc, USB 3.x to USB-C is just a matter of slot/plug shape, isn't it?   I think you're conflating connectors and buses. USB 1, 1.1, 2, 3 and 3.1 are all buses, not connectors. The idea of converting 3.1 to C makes no sense. USB C is just a connector, and devices which have this connector will almost certainly be USB 3.1 compliant. The only exceptions are oddments like the Nokia N1 tablet which has a USB 2 over a USB C connector.  What you're describing is USB A (the normal, large connector we associate with the host device in a USB connection) to USB C adaptors. And yes it's just a physical conversion, you're absolutely right there. But people still object to having to buy such adaptors for the new rMB, and I suspect they would here too, especially since the rMBP is billed as a capable machine for professionals, or at least more intensive use, which includes high peripheral availability. Tbh this doesn't bother me too much, as is evident from the fact I'm typing this on a rMB, but it's been one of the biggest complaints about this device so far. And I think that, until USB C becomes standard enough for most peripherals to be using it, people will object to having to buy adaptors just to plug in a pen drive, hard drive, or something else. Even though it doesn't personally bug me too much (and I just bought the cheaper Chromebook USB C - A adaptor), I have to say I see their point. Even moreso with the rMBP.  But at the same time, I don't think Apple will see this as a big enough deal to actually include a dying port on a new model, and such people will essentially be told to buy an adaptor and deal with it until the transition is further along.   3 USB-C (remember, you can daisy chain TB) would be more than enough for most MBP users, Apple may slot 2 on each side (4 total) to be on the safe/user-friendly side.   Interesting point, as I was adding together the current number of TB and USB A ports, but when you put it like that what you're saying makes more sense. It'll partly depend on what they use for charging, and if they ditch magsafe (which they hopefully don't) and just use the peripheral ports for charging, that means they'll probably have 4 TB3 ports (which are a USB C connector). But perhaps 5 is a bit of an overestimation there, so fair point."
apple,3dtcis,originem_virtutis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:05 2015 UTC,Perhaps. But I don't see it happening within a year or two. Maybe they might ADD a type c USB but not a complete overhaul.

I'm inclined to think it would be less than one.  (Granted I'd expect at least one fake review from someone associated with the company.)  This isn't based on any evidence other than the fact that there are millions of apps that no one has nor ever will hear about.  There is a massive amount of competition in the App Store, and most don't have a chance. You really need to stand out if you want attention."

I can use the Go phone temporarily while I'm car shopping or whatever it is I am up to, then when I'm done, I let the minutes run out.

It's just such a massively difficult market to predict. Traditional watches are never going to to die, first off. Hell, most people who still wear wristwatches are doing it because they think watches are interesting and/or as a fashion statement. Smartwatches don't even touch that market. And I think what really kickstarted the smartwatch market were the more basic health tracking bands, which you'll notice have most certainly not disappeared. Maybe more rugged, simple devices are going to become ubiquitous, while fully-fledged smartphones fill a niche. Who knows? I sure as shit don't."

Your numbers are horribly skewed.   Minimum wage is like, $7.75/hr right now? $10/ hr is $400/ week gross, which is about 275.00 after taxes, health insurance if you're lucky enough, etc. So rent around here in a decent neighborhood on a studio apartment is ~$550. That leaves $550. Utilities suck up another $150. Now there's $400 left for food, transportation, clothing, and entertainment.

It's only normal to buy things that you wanted, and your parents didn't give to you. That's why you got a job.

The benchmarks they chose were previous products that may or may not live in similar classes as the watch.  I don't believe that the Apple Watch is selling more or less units then Apple anticipated.  I think they probably had a pretty good idea about how much demand they would see, certainly within a reasonable margin of error.  Which means they were willing to go into a market that they knew was not as big as their other products, for now.  And I give them credit for that.  They have established an interesting pattern of releasing products with the bare minimum features to gain a beachhead.  Look at where the original iPhone started and where it went.  How many people pointed out the lack of 3G, the lack of third party apps, background apps, copy/paste and all the other things Nokia had been doing for years?   Apple seems to follow a pretty clear recipe for disruptive innovation.  Find a beachhead market that's ""good enough"" to gain a foothold and expand out until you've evolved a product that does everything the competition does PLUS the stuff that only you do.  The iPhone was good enough to make a splash with people who were enamored with what it did and didn't care about what it didn't. (Like limited email capability) As the email improved, more and more Blackberry users came over.  Eventually Apple went with big screens and snagged a huge chunk of Android owners.  With each feature, they closed the gap with the competition while still offering the core things that made their loyal customer base happy.  I think the watch fits this bill.  It offers enough functionality to be interesting to millions of iPhone users.  I love mine even though it was accurately described as a remote control for the iPhone.  That works for me and I like it.  Eventually it will do other things, like have built in cell service, FaceTime cameras, and things that make it actually compete with the iPhone as a stand alone device.  Apple has figured out that it's very difficult to build the perfect product without seeing it in the wild.  So they release their beachhead version and evolve it.  I think it's a great strategy but it would be lost on pundits and click bait authors who can't really think past the next news cycle."

Apple would never have made a product like Google glass, but mainly because it looks dorky and goofy as hell, not because they can't innovate.   The screen is also horrendously small compared to the phone & would require beefier hardware. The watch is an auxiliary device, and FaceTime is one of the things that wouldn't transition well into that environment.

Writers on that site are paid by the click and claiming to have spotted a fatal flaw in one of the most successful companies in the world gets you a lot of clicks."
apple,3dqbeh,Paiste402,5,Sat Jul 18 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"It's a niche market, the Apple Watch has transcended more mainstream then any other typical smart watch.  These numbers mean absolutely one thing; Apple ran a successful initial advertising campaign.  I am sure they made there initial investment money back with the payback period method.  I am happy with my Apple Watch, because it's a step up from a Pebble.  People need to account Simpson's Paradox when looking into these sales numbers of other smart watch manufacturers and see that Apple blew them out of the water for generating sales upon release.    I think what hurt Apple sales wise was not having available units first hand, like supplying Apple Stores (I know they had boutiques but it was select locations).  There is a lot of impulse buyers in the locations where Apple Stores are placed.  Demographically Apple Stores are placed in high to medium socioeconomic areas.  I think having the try on appointments and availability to walk home with one that day would of created much more appeal.  Selling a traditional watch is all about the physical appeal and how it wears on that person.  I believe it was a disconnect for some potential Watch owners to come in for a fitting, then walk out empty handed.    Apple has a tight ship it comes to production and costs, where everything is generally ramped up for production pretty close to a ship date.  I think with this new watch and having to train employees on new procedures really put it behind, there was definitely some kinks in the ramp-up phase of production.     BTW I am no rich boy, I am a college student that is about to attend law school. All I have for my name is a steady paycheck and some stock shares."

Never mind that super cars are a small market to people with big money and just want a toy.

apple,3dqbeh,HollandGW215,18,Sun Jul 19 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"the Slice numbers that Wilson and others have been throwing around that surveyed only those customers that opt into their service.   I think the biggest thing Slice supporters are ignoring is that they are by necessity an extremely privacy-invading service, and that they're measuring the sales of a product by an extreme privacy-conscious company. A morality that is probably reflected in its users, especially those of their most trusted customers, who would be the far more likely early adopters. This alone makes Slice's data extremely inaccurate."

It's not a major selling point.  That said, I still don't see any evidence of a flop for the Watch. Looks to me like it's doing well enough as a first version. And I imagine next year's will be even more successful."
apple,3dqbeh,RedditV4,4,Sat Jul 18 14:57:50 2015 UTC,I'm glad Apple is making private part of the conversation though. It's about time somebody raised people's awareness of the issues at hand.
apple,3dqbeh,sobri909,0,Sat Jul 18 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"I like what they're doing. But I don't think the unsubtle jabs at Google are as warranted as many think. Google have a very different strategy on data collecting, but they still act very ethically.  Facebook have a much rougher history than Google when it comes to privacy ethics, for example. But Apple aren't in competition with Facebook, so that's not where the snark gets directed."
apple,3dqbeh,RedditV4,3,Sat Jul 18 17:23:48 2015 UTC,"No, data mining is inherently unethical. Treating humans as product to be sold is unethical. It happens in retail too, where Apple Pay plugs the issue to some degree.  Unfortunately, Apple's warning shots across the bow of Google are just puffery, their cloud services are piss poor and simply can't compete with Google's offerings. So it comes across as little more than political mud slinging on their part."

apple,3dqbeh,jmnugent,7,Sun Jul 19 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"Also   Slice only works in the USA, believe it or not, there are other countries, and the US represents about 30% of Apple's revenues (the American continents represent 36%) A watch is most often bought in stores, specially when you have various sizes and colors to chose, materials and bracelets. Apple has 266 stores for this in the US. Those don't get sniffed out by slice. At first, the AW was only available online, and now it's available in stores, so it is normal to sell less online (that's the only way they know). Even at their reported sales numbers, 3M so far, not including Christmas, which is much more important for watches than for phones or computers, is more than enough to not call a flop, since the top sellers in the total of 2014, didn't sell ⅓ of that."
apple,3dqbeh,mb862,7,Sat Jul 18 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"Also, Apple doesn't do low margins or loss leaders. 3 million devices sold at a minimum of $350 is still over a billion dollars of revenue. We can conservatively assume a 25% profit margin for the watch, so their ""flop"" is still at least 250 million dollars of profit at minimum to date.   In all likelihood, their sales numbers are higher, their price point average is definitely higher, and their margins are likely closer to 40%. I wouldn't be at all surprised if their v1 product that's only been on sale for a few months is a half billion dollars of profit already and over a billion dollars of profit by the time v2 rolls around.   You can only even pretend revenues and profits of that magnitude are a flop if you're comparing it to Apple and iPhones. Any other company would be lauded for creating a billion dollar product line on their first attempt."
apple,3dqbeh,jmnugent,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"How/why does it matter from-whom you got sales-data from,.. if it still reflects actual Watches SOLD.   This isn't a pre-order product where everyone is saying ""Yeah -- I'll buy one WHEN IT COMES OUT."" ---- it's an actual product.. that's actually available.. and has actually sold (ballpark) somewhere between 2million and 5million ALREADY. Actual concrete sales.   It's also still a 1st gen product,.. so No,.. it's probably not gonna sell as well as an iPhone or iPad,etc. But there's nothing wrong with that. With an average sale of somewhere in the $500 ballpark,.. and having sold (various estimates) between 2million and 5million).. Apple has made a pretty good chunk of cash on this already."
apple,3dqbeh,autonomousgerm,10,Sat Jul 18 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"if it still reflects actual Watches SOLD.   But that's my point, is that it doesn't.

That proportion is clearly not representative of the actual customers buying Watches."
apple,3dqbeh,mb862,5,Sat Jul 18 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"But the Slice extrapolation/estimates are pretty close to just about every other group making estimates.   http://fortune.com/2015/04/13/how-many-apple-watches-were-sold-worldwide-on-friday/ http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/16/8398579/apple-watch-sales-estimates   Those numbers aren't terribly unreasonable.

Give the thing a few iterations to tell for sure. The first iPhone is a paperweight compared with the current model. The first watch surely leaves something to be desired, but it's only through YEARS of R&D plus YEARS of customer feedback that they'll refine it."

Some people say it needs a SIM, but that's absurd, because nobody will be going to leave the phone at home, and instead of that, carry a device that only has a 1.5"" screen and no camera, and worst of all, doesn't let you make private calls (only speakerphone). Specially considering that putting 3G would consume much more battery just for that..."
apple,3dqbeh,paross,0,Sat Jul 18 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"Sustainable battery life. 18 hours max really translates to much less for someone who is a heavy user. I don't know many people who will buy something of this nature and not use it a lot. Better OS. Watch Kit 2.0 looks promising, but the APIs are really limited still. The watch being able to process instead of relying on the phone processing is a good start, but I think the processor itself had to be scaled way back to match the small form factor. Like it or not, people will compare the watch to the phone. It's smaller and has less room for the hardware necessary for the performance people have come to expect, but until it is closer it will seem like a second class citizen. Smaller form factor. Specifically depth. This is a THICK watch. It is as thick as the first iPhone. Apple needs to work some big time magic here and shrink the watch while improving the battery life. Better health options. Apple Watch was going to be a big time player in the health and wellness world. But Apple had to scrap some of the sensors in the watch for performance and battery reasons. My guess would be that future iterations will include said missing sensors, but this one does not.  Answering the question, ""Why"". They did a STELLAR job telling me why I need an iPhone. All they seem to say about the watch is that it is very personal. Steve Jobs identified three practical uses for iPhone. 1. It is a web browser. 2. It is an iPod. 3. It is a phone. It was that elementary. With Apple Watch we get, ""It's the most personal device we've ever created. You wear it on your body.""  SO WHAT? What does it do for my $600 that the phone doesn't already. This to me was one of their larger mistakes, one I hope they can correct with the Apple Watch 2.   So, is this device great? Sure, probably. But it leaves more for me to be desired.  There is someone pointing out a few things they personally feel is missing."

What this would do is allow Verizon/AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile to carry the watch. $400 might sound expensive to drop at once but what if you paid $20 a month instead?   It's similar to contract phones. Yeah $700 for a phone is expensive but once you break it down into your contract or monthly payments, it becomes easier to swallow.  I own the Space Gray Apple Watch which is the most expensive Sports version. A lot of people say they like my watch or want one but they just can't flat out afford it. I don't think I've heard anything regarding it being pointless or dumb, just price concerns.    In my opinion, is the Watch useful? Yeah, it's actually pretty nice. I find it incredibly convenient because honestly, I dislike having to stare at a large screen. Having a watch to stare at notifications to see if they're important or to quick reply is super handy. Using it as a watch also is nice as I used to pull out my phone for that.  Would I say it's worth the money? I'm not sure yet. I was actually thinking about getting the $1000+ model but for something limited now and potentially going to get a huge update in a second gen model I could not justify the price. $400+ though is I guess is a better price point. I still do understand why someone wouldn't want to plop down $400 on a notification/fitness device. Now that I've used the Watch, I couldn't imagine living without it so I don't regret getting it."

And average people don't wear watches anymore and are not going to be all that interested in something that doesn't do much more than taking your phone out of your pocket.   I think it would have behooved Apple to have spent more time on creating something that was as far apart from the traditional notion of what a watch is and more akin to some super crazy futuristic invention that's strapped to our wrists.   That's what they did with the iPhone... phones before that were for making phone calls and not much else... the iPhone changed that definition into more of a mobile computer that happens to make calls.

To them the iwatch is too complicated and they don't want to replace their Rolex with something that is just apple.  Iphone changed the game. The iwatch did not. Kind of did everything we all expected it to be. Too me, it was a bit conservative in what apple could do.  I like my watch because I don't wear other watches. I like it for working out and calories.

Fitness stuff - I get it. But addictive and earth shaking in the spirit of retail, I don't.   Notifications - I get it. Buzz and sales worthy, not so much.   Battery life if the huge killer for this device. Because it is not the dominant communication center like a phone, it will not become a habitual part of the body. The phone can be set aside or charged while still doing its thing. The limited watch battery drives this flaw-in-concept.   So, it is only an iPhone complimentary adjunct at best, at the VERY best.

As has been said - there is no killer app.   And theorize this........what could possibly be a killer app with the adjunct watch that would not be  killer with the phone, alone."

You're expecting the watch to be better. It isn't. However, it is faster. I do not think it is wise to underestimate a device that makes something you do slightly faster. It is the entire principle behind remotes, Siri, Google Now, microwaves, SSDs, any new Intel chip, automatic transmission, 4G, fast food, instant noodles, teabags and instant coffee."

apple,3dvoo7,mikeytd,4,Sun Jul 19 22:35:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they're putting thought into it judging by the VR and AR patents that we periodically see coming out of Cupertino, but they haven't specifically addressed it in any of their products as of yet.  For smartphone VR, however, I think that what matters at this point is graphics power, resolution, and the accelerometers / gyroscopes, and the iPhone isn't exactly a slouch on any of those things.  Google Cardboard does work with the iPhone now and I think there some apps for it on the app store beyond Google's demo app so it's already possible to use for VR that way.  I think Apple may end up being a bit resistant to VR in general; VR's whole thing is that it takes over your whole reality, while Apple generally believes that technology should just blend into the background and be as unobtrusive as possible.  VR is sort of the anti-Apple-Watch in this sense.  I could see them being more amenable to HoloLens-style AR, tech that enhances your reality rather than replacing it, once the tech can be made sufficiently physically unobtrusive."

Once it's been polished and works great Apple will probably latch on a few years after that. Which is good for Apple users as it will hopefully work without flaws at that point
apple,3dvoo7,IfUHadAZuneIHateYou,2,Sun Jul 19 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely not gimmicky at all.

In this new endeavour, I expect to see much trial and error from many a company before Apple dives into it as they usually do for big rollouts: elegantly, with an already-mature product on day one, from a usability perspective. We're years of research and real-world data before Apple considers marketing it. But internally, as research? You can bet they already have some Occulus-like design functioning."

apple,3dqr8m,IAteTheTigerOhMyGosh,47,Sat Jul 18 15:27:17 2015 UTC,My thoughts are either it was delayed because: 1 - They are going back to giving away an iPod. 2 - It's just going to be a shortened promotion. 3 - Something to do with apple music being bundled in too.
apple,3dqr8m,IAmA5starman,27,Sat Jul 18 15:38:44 2015 UTC,Apple Music should be free for 1 year with the purchase of any new iPhone. That could be a huge selling point for anyone on the fence  $120 value FREE! Plus having a customer use the service for a year might make them dependent on it. After using Spotify for 2-3 months I couldn't be without it. I wonder what it would really cost Apple to subsidize all these subs. I'm sure they could work something out with the record companies and artists to pay them a bit less like they worked it out with Taylor Swift
apple,3dqr8m,WhatsUpBras,-37,Sat Jul 18 17:07:13 2015 UTC,What? Apple doesn't give anything for free. Only if they screw up...
apple,3dqr8m,NEDM64,21,Sat Jul 18 18:19:01 2015 UTC,Were you not aware of the 3 free months of apple music that they have given to everyone?

They have more than enough money in the bank etc. and they aren't legally or morally obligated to keep doing a Back to School promo just cause you want them to.

apple,3dqr8m,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"Well technically, a ""Debbie Downer"" is really just a slang for pessimist, someone who points out the undesirable, but indeed very real possible, outcome in a situation. Your point was fair, but him pointing out pessimism isn't exactly a bad thing.  Franky, I just feel bad for people named Debbie, since now their name is forever associated with pessimism.

August is more appropriate, as schools don't start until late August or early September (usually after Labor Day if they start in September)."

If I had been smarter, I'd have taken that money and invested in a kickass Mac.   Perhaps that's why Apple is delaying the promotion? Opportune moment after everyone's funds are in order?"
apple,3dqr8m,mrevergood,4,Sat Jul 18 17:55:30 2015 UTC,Many colleges in the U.S. start in the third week of August. Waiting until a few days before this seems like it's outside people's decision making window.

The annual Back-To-School program was a huge push for students to jump in and buy their new Mac right there from their campus.  That said, freshmen would most commonly buy their Mac when their parents came along with them (since mom and dad have the credit card). The only time that mom and dad come to college with their kid? Freshmen orientation.  When is freshmen orientation? End of May through beginning of July. All these kids this year got screwed. (Or, they didn't buy a Mac because the incentive to do from previous years has been MIA.)"
