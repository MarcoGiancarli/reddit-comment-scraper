SourceFed,3doww8,stachldrat,10,Sat Jul 18 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"Shift in talents, mainly. A lot of the old hosts were actively trying to get better at improv comedy. Some of them even joined improv groups during their time at SF. The ""yes, and..."" mentality of the old hosts took front and center. You can see that even now, when Joe popped back up for a TableTalk.   The new hosts are not as driven by improv comedy. They favor writing-heavy comedy, where they've had the time to think over and edit the jokes as they see fit. This may be in part because some of them are not as comfortable with improv comedy (I know Bree admitted this out loud on a #BarelyBored video back when), but either way it's just a style choice between comedic personalities.   I guess the best example that's mainstream would be Late Night talk shows. Craig Ferguson (recently departed) ran a show that was about 80% improv comedy. Conan O'Brian runs a show that is almost entirely written comedy. Jimmy Fallon prefers sketch comedy, which is a unique blend of writing and improv. Seth Meyers runs a show which leans heavily on dry wit, which while also a writing-heavy style, is extremely different than Conan's style.   Everyone has their strengths and preferences. The current SF crew just don't favor (either out of preference or skill) improv. It could stay this way, or it could change drastically in the future. We'll just have to see."

I can understand if he continues to point it out, because it is something that continues to bother him. But I also understand that it is annoying that he keeps bringing it up. Having said that, it's even more annoying that people would rather him not say anything about racism simply because it makes them feel uncomfortable. But I decided I would choose my battles."
SourceFed,3dqzza,charityamis,4,Mon Jul 20 15:29:59 2015 UTC,"So, this is a complicated issue. Personally, I have no idea what DJ was trying to infer, if anything, by his comments in SHRoundUp, but the idea that MARVEL has a lot of racist undertones in it is not that uncommon.   I've known many people over the years who are avid comic book fans and who believe that MARVEL, DC, and well, just about any company that has ties back to the Golden Era maintain a lot of inherently racist material. They still read the comic books, but they have no probably saying that the people who wrote the stories were essentially racists, sexists, etc.  The fact of the matter is, yes, some material in comics has an undertone of one form of hate/bias or another, if for no other reason than the way the world was at the time or the way someone was raised. These things should be acknowledged, of course, but those who go out of their road to point out the injustices every single time they see something are, in my opinion, annoying. This is mainly because if you start looking for injustice, you'll end up seeing things that don't exist.   Case in point, a few months back, people began hating on DC again for this Batgirl cover, because it was a tribute back to The Killing Joke. The problem was that Batgirl is one of few female heroes with her own comic, and the cover referenced a story line (one I should mention that is one of the seminal works of DC) where Batgirl was abused, mentally and physically, and quite possibly raped. They thought that, regardless of the fact that The Killing Joke was one of the most impactful story lines DC has ever released and well worth a nod to the artists and writers that created it, the cover was insensitive and hurt the credibility of all female heroes.   Why would I bring up this instance of possibly sexism and misogyny? Well, because at the same time, MARVEL had been (and still is) making its A.K.A. Jessica Jones series, which they wouldn't shut up about, especially after casting David Tennant as the Purple Man. Here's the thing, the history of the Purple Man and Jessica Jones is that he gets inside her head, and controls her, turns her into his personal play thing. He eventually uses this to send her after Daredevil, but in the meantime, there are heavy indications of sexual abuse. And yet... No outrage. This was a story where rape was a real and undeniable thing. It is a corner stone in the development of Jessica Jones' character. You could almost call it her origin story. It's not just a one off thing that will be gone in a week. It's not even a thing where the sexual abuse was merely left as a maybe/maybe not part of the story. And... no outrage.  Similarly, and slightly outside of the comic book universe, Doctor Who series 8 had an episode called Kill the Moon. The basic story is, it's the first time humanity is faced with alien life that the Doctor is not going to save them from. They have to make a choice as to kill it or let it live. The alien life is... inside an egg, the moon. While reviews were mixed (as with most Doctor Who episodes), there was a huge uproar from some fans saying that the story wasn't anything to do with violence or war or any of that. It was all about abortion and women's rights, because Moffat is a misogynist. Once again, I quite believe that it was overlooking the plot points to find something offensive.   All in all, everyone has views that are not popular. Some good, unprejudiced people still want the Confederate flag to fly in South Carolina. Some extremely kind-hearted people still think the best way to deal with foreign affairs is to bomb the hell out of everything. Some who spend every day fighting for equal rights for women believe that a girl who wears a tight shirt and little skirt can only be doing so in an attempt to sexualize herself.  The world is tricky. We have to acknowledge the problems and contradictions that exist within society, but we have to be conscious of those issues we choose to ""fix,"" and how we decide to go about fixing them. In my experience, yelling at the top of your lungs at every little thing that offends you is the quickest way for people to stop caring about what you think. I kind of like Sun Tzu's attitude, ""To fight and conquer in all our battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting."""

I'm going to paraphrase what I've said in the past about titles like these. They're not for us. The titles are not what SourceFed fans look for. We look for the content because we know the people who will be giving it to us. The titles are for the people that don't know that. ""Adults do Long Division"" is a very accessible title. It creates an impulse to click; a bait, if you will. It's something that, should the video be objectively interesting or marketable, social outlets will use. ""These adults are given a simple task, you won't BELIEVE what happens"" is a basic abstraction from it.   In short, the titles aren't for you, the content is. Watch that, forget about the title."

SourceFed,3d8v6e,technid,3,Tue Jul 14 22:37:04 2015 UTC,"Who says I'm not dealing? I'm glad SourceFed was brave enough to move into new areas, doesn't mean I have to think the area they've gone to is good. I'm still subscribed, I still watch a large portion of their content, I just don't watch what doesn't interest me.   I mean, we're already in SFv3(or 4, depends on what constitutes a version change for some), so we should all be well used to change.   I think what annoys me is that Comm Comm was dropped not using their normal metric. Comm Comm's views were consistent and good, on both channels. But it was put by the wayside to make way for new content that ultimately didn't replace it, not meet its own requirements. So the SF Metric was applied (low views = bye bye), and Barely Bored, Deep Dive, and for a brief period SHRU, went away.   There's a distinct difference between those that ""want old SourceFed back""(I think the technical term is ""childish idiots""), and people who want good SourceFed back. I am willing to bet, that should they bring back Comm Comm, its views would consistently surpass what Barely Bored or Deep Dive achieved."
SourceFed,3d8v6e,StuartM96,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:59:42 2015 UTC,"That's strange because if you go back to the final few Comment Commentaries a lot of them are pulling in 10,000 less views than most of their normal videos.

Certain people who allow for autographs charge for not only signings or pictures, but just appearances and meeting.   It sometimes leaves you feeling unfulfilled, sometimes it's  awesome. Maybe just consider your biggest names, and move forward from there. Either way, you're gonna have a great time. Cons are lots of fun, especially if its something you enjoy, because you're with a big, extended family.  Hope that helps!"

Sidenote: What do they do at these shows? Do they just talk to each other on stage and take questions?

It is pretty much just a live Q&A but they stick around after the show to meet and have photo ops with everyone. If you pay more, you have your photo op guaranteed before the show and in some cases, you get to play ninja with other members of the Nation (and Phil has been known to participate).  I know that it doesn't sound like much but if you have the opportunity to go to a DeFranco Does show...I HIGHLY recommend it. Also, depending on what city you're in, there may be other unannounced special guests in the crowd."

I find Wil's videos to be repetitive in delivery and sometimes in jokes, I would like it if he changed his bit up a bit. I didn't like Brie to begin with but I think she (and her Lieberman partnership) to be the best thing on Sourcefed at the moment. I watch sourcefed for their videos, now.  With the main channel, it's mainly the fan interaction I am missing, the channel has evolved into entertainment rather than news, I think thats a shame (I really enjoyed Joe's science videos) but understand why, but I never did really understand why they stopped/didn't properly replace CommComm. Now, I don't understand why they still ask questions if there is no outlet for them to respond.  On Nerd, it's just too weird. I like all the Nerd hosts, but Sam/Steve together really I can't do. Also the focus on Nerd news isn't what I signed up for. It was for the games (board and video) and being an innovative, fun channel. They sucked the soul right out of it. Which was fine(ish) as long as SPF took some of that but it didn't.  As for both channels, the ads have become really intrusive.  As I say, I haven't unsubbed but for me, those would be the reasons why I would."
