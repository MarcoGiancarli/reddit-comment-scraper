Here is a story, published in The National Herald (Greek newspaper in the US), about a man who was involved with St. Anthony's.

OrthodoxChristianity,3dy6pt,AwwShucksGuys,4,Mon Jul 20 14:30:49 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question is almost certainly no - God's essence cannot become an energy (though the energies express the essence).  The essence/energy distinction came about primarily to help understand two different questions.  The first is: How do we know about God (since he is infinite and utterly different from anything we know in creation)?  The second is: How can we participate in God (become ""deified"") while remaining distinct from God (i.e., without becoming one of the Trinity, or simply being absorbed)?  In the first case, we can guard the absolute transcendence of God by saying that, although we never know what God is in essence, we know him in the way that he reveals himself to us.  So we can really say that God exists, that he is Good, that he loves us, etc., and when we do so we are not circumscribing the essence, or saying that we fully understand it, but making true claims about the way that God reveals himself to us.  (This is true at some level even among human beings - though we think we may know a lot about someone by the way they interact with us, there is always a mysterious otherness, an infinite depth ""behind the eyes"" that always seems out of reach.)  In the second case, we can say that we become one with God by being united to the divine energies.  If we became one with God's essence, then we would have to have become God himself.  We never become God essentially, but we rather take on some of the properties of God (though all have the divine image, only the saints have the divine likeness), and through our willing cooperation, we become aspects of God-as-he-reveals-himself-to-be."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dy6pt,Jeremiah05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"Okay I think you cleared up quite a bit of my confusion. However can you expound a little on where the Son fits into this. If I understand the concept of essence correctly. We can never know what God is in essence and thus Moses can't see God only his energy (burning bush, God flying over, etc.) however people could see Christ and to some extent knew how the humans of Him felt (feeling abandoned, being hungry, etc.)"
OrthodoxChristianity,3dy6pt,Jeremiah05,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:25 2015 UTC,"The incarnation makes an already tricky subject even trickier! The fundamental thing to keep in mind about Christ to avoid heresy is that there is ONE person with TWO natures.  However, not everything we can say about the PERSON applies equally to both NATURES.  For example, we can say that Christ is passible (i.e., capable of death), but we cannot therefore say that the divine nature is passible, for Christ had two natures and he (the divine-human person Christ) was passible in virtue of his having a human nature.  Likewise, the disciples saw Christ, who is God, but they saw him in virtue of his having taken on a human nature (including, obviously, a body).  The divine nature is still not visible/graspable by human thought (though again, just as the divine energies express the divine essence, so the divine Logos reveals God to us)."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dy6pt,Jeremiah05,2,Mon Jul 20 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Perhaps another thing that will clear up some confusion - it doesn't really make sense to speak of the essence or the energies becoming incarnate.  Those notions are both too abstract in a sense - in addition to the essence and the energies in God, there are the hypostases, that is, the divine Persons (who are the specific manifestations of the essence (finding the right language is tricky here)).  In Christ, neither the divine essence nor the divine energies as such become incarnate, but a divine Person, the eternal Son of God."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dy6pt,Jeremiah05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"So to be divine, the divine Person would possess God's essence? But that essence would not be visible to the Apostles and others since essence is abstract."

He basically says that church and state have never coexisted well, that when the state supported the church, it has ended up damaging the church, and even persecuting the saints within the church.  He stops well short of advocating anarchy though.  I don't personally see how anarchy is compatible with Christianity outside an extreme Protestant perspective."

In my parish, there was a common timeline for everyone. There was a class that ran the full church year. We were then made catechumens at the beginning of Lent and chrismated (or baptized) on Holy Saturday.  So from the time I began attending to chrismation was about a year."

But once you do, you'll realize there's really nothing to be nervous about.  After I finally talked to the priest, he told me there was a class for inquirers. I also met with him a couple times before it began to discuss Orthodoxy and he gave me some reading.   At some point before Lent those of us in the inquirer's class each had a long talk with the priest and decided whether to go ahead and become catachumens. There was zero pressure to do it."

After maybe a month I started crossing myself in the Orthodox manner.  I was too self conscious to venerate the icons for a couple of months, and it took a lot longer than that before I actually felt comfortable doing it.  After maybe 3 months, the priest sent me an email asking whether I wanted to officially become a catechumen and I replied yes.  To my surprise, the blessed me as a catechumen the very next Sunday after the service.  That was maybe 9 months ago.  I'm probably going to get baptized sometime in the next month or so, although I hope I have more warning than I did when I became a catechumen!"

My whole process from first inquiry to baptism (I had previously been baptized by a group suspect in their Trinitarianism) took about a year, across two parishes because I moved."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,sfmess,2,Mon Jul 20 11:35:10 2015 UTC,"I go to a super small mission parish in Alaska. The first weekend we had a priest (which happened to be my second weekend attending Orthodox liturgies luckily), I just aproached our priest after Vespers, once everyone had finished confessions.   I introduced myself, told him I was a Catholic interested in converting,  and asked how and when to cross myself, and how to properly venerate the icons. I got a excellent conversation out of it, got to know our priest, and learned a ton.  The very next day I started crossing myself during my first divine liturgy.  If you're at all stressed or worried about it, I definitely encourage you just to talk to your priest. :) ...and sure, you'll screw up a few times once you start to cross yourself, but no one will really worry too much about it."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,thechivster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:24:38 2015 UTC,Random but how is Orthodoxy in Alaska!? I've always been fascinated by the mix of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Aleutian culture :)
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,sfmess,2,Sun Jul 19 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"It's definitely different. Down south in the lower 48 it's much more of an immigrant phenomenon. Up here, it's hard to explain, but Orthodoxy is almost a part of the landscape.  It's definitely considered the traditional faith for many of the coastal aboriginal tribes and has incorporated into their culture in varying degrees depending on the tribe. In Juneau for example, an area which had minimal Russian influence, the local Tlingit (koloch) elders had a vision of St. Nicholas and went, along with some Serbian miners, to the bishop in Sitka to ask for a mission to be set up.  The liturgies incorporate the local language as well. In Juneau the Trisagion is sung first in English, then Slavonic,  then Tlingit, same with the Our Father, and other prayers. The cathedral in Sitka incorporates Aleut and Tlingit into the liturgies as well."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,thechivster,2,Mon Jul 20 08:19:27 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Are all the Aleuts Orthodox or different Christian denominations? That's beautiful honestly :) It's like Orthodoxy keeps the culture alive!
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,sfmess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:06:50 2015 UTC,"Orthodoxy keeps the culture alive is a very good way to put it! =)  After the Alaskan purchase, the Territorial government divided Alaska up into various districts with schools administered by a given protestant church for that particular district. The stated object of these schools was ""Americanize"" the natives, namely, to disconnect them from their culture, their language, and, if they had it, their Orthodox faith. The Orthodox clergy fought this to the best of their abilities. A lot of conversions occurred after the Alaskan Purchase because the natives were impressed how the Orthodox fought to defend their culture, even in areas with minimal Russian contact.  Would that they were all Orthodox! For the most part from my experience, if the natives are Christian, they're Orthodox. The rest usually fall into a mishmash of atheism/agnosticism/neo-pagan revival, followed by a minuscule amount adhering to whichever Protestant church ran the schools in the area. There are exceptions of course, but for the coastal natives, this is generally how it is."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,Raptor-Llama,2,Wed Jul 22 06:14:43 2015 UTC,"After the first service, I googled how to properly cross myself, and since then I did it. For maybe a month I never venerated the icons or went up to kiss the priest's cross at the end, but then I started doing that. Then I was bowing, and then lent came and I was doing prostrations and everything.  I still don't light the candle, and when the icon in the center is missing or obscured sometimes I freak out and just skip venerating the icons then. Hopefully I'll start lighting candles by the time I'm chrismated."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,keromaru,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"I was raised Catholic, and was Episcopalian for 7 years before I started attending, so the sign of the cross was no big deal.  I just had to adjust to the switch from left-to-right to right-to-left.  And I attended off and on most of last year, attended very regularly starting Christmas.  What pushed me over the edge was the one-two punch of a visit from the Metropolitan and my first  Pascha.  A few weeks later I told the priest I wanted to be Orthodox.  Now I'm taking a class."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,RelytDraw21,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:20 2015 UTC,"I started basically on my first visit. But this is mostly because a previous pastor of mine used to make the sign of the cross at the benediction. And surprisingly, even years before even knowing what the Orthodox Church was, I had been crossing myself correctly!! So it was pretty natural for me, but I feel like I'd be in the minority here"
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,Moonpi314,2,Sun Jul 19 22:04:38 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, I remember being super self-conscious about crossing myself as well. Well, I grew up Catholic, so I was used to doing the sign of the cross, but I remember being self-conscious about doing it right to left in the Orthodox way. I didn't know if it was offensive to be doing it that way when I was just an inquirer and not an official catechumen. So I kind of just didn't do any while at liturgy, because I also didn't want to do it left to right, lol. I am actually not sure when I started - same with venerating icons.  I guess what I am trying to say is don't worry. Everything will happen in time. For me I believe I became a catechumen in the fall and then chrismated that  follwing spring before Easter (so like 6-8 months?). But, I had been an inquirer for years before that and was pretty ""well-read"" on a lot of Orthodoxy...like a lot of converts do. During college I went a few times, but I didn't really have a car and it was far away and I was nervous about the whole thing. I went a little bit more after college, but it wasn't until I moved to a new city and found a church I really loved and fully made the commitment to convert that it happened ""fast."" The process itself was pretty much, become an official catechumen, partake in the Church, and I also attended the ""catechumen"" classes (which were open to the whole church) about the faith and the Church. Orthodox churches are pretty tight-knit - just cause there aren't that many of us! - so when I went, the priest knew I was new. I talked to him after during coffee hour, he introduced me to like-aged people, and then I kind of just got involved.   If you have any questions feel free to ask."

But I knew it was right to left and I knew it was with three fingers together, but I was doing it like this on my first visit:   http://i.imgur.com/gaLqEja.jpg  I've been extremely blessed and I was privileged to have weekly meetings with my parish priest for catechism. This went on for about a year. I became a catechumen about two months after attending frequently, Holy Week was the last straw for me. I was like ""This is the Church. Make me a catechumen please.""   So basically I inquired for about two months, and was a catechumen for about a year, then I was baptized and chrismated on Pascha."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,SnarkleSparkle,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:22 2015 UTC,"I started crossing myself I'd guess after a month or two, but for some reason I really had to work up my courage to venerate icons or the cross. Then, about 4-5 months into attending regularly, after liturgy one day the kids went to the front for something and my son (4 at the time) went up with them. They were right up there so they venerated the cross first and he went up and kissed it like he had been doing it all his life. My husband and I instantly teared up seeing him do that- I was so excited and so proud of him! After that, I decided to follow his example and do what I had been too nervous to do. Sometimes you really do have to become like little children. ;) I would say, do what you're comfortable with, but if you want to cross yourself or kiss the cross and you're scared- just go for it!   Anyway, we started going in the summertime, just before a catechism class started up in early fall. We became catechumens right before Great Lent and were received just before Pascha. So all in all, just under a year."
OrthodoxChristianity,3duwf5,Shadow_Wanderer,2,Mon Jul 20 00:35:02 2015 UTC,I started to cross after a few months visiting. That wasn't too hard for me.

I became a Catechumen in January of 2015. And then at the Paschal vigil of 2015 I was chrismated. :)

I had a much harder time to allow myself to open up and lifting my hands in reciting the Lords Prayer.   My scary newbie story to chuckle at when I first started visiting my work schedule was crazy so I could make the Saturday vesper service but rarely the Sunday Liturgy. One Saturday after service as we walked up to venerate the cross the Priest leaned forward and asked if I could stay a bit. I sat on a front pew with my mind racing ""What did I do?"" Turns out he just said ""I've been noticing you and wanted to invite you to our Sunday service"". Whew!!!    Also, most churches are welcoming but some I guess because of ethnic differences can seem standoffish.

Maybe my third service I started. During a Vespers, my priest invited me at the end, saying, ""You're welcome to venerate the icons if you want."" I didn't that day, but it definitely put me at ease. Another Vespers (for Pentecost) there was a part when we venerated an icon, ate bread, and had a cross put on our foreheads with oil. I didn't know if I could join, but again the priest looked over to me and said I was welcome, so I did. Not long after, I was venerating the Cross and the Gospels, and it was only a few weeks later I was kissing and bowing before the icons.  It was definitely just a self-consciousness problem, not something I had considered idolatry or anything. I became Christian like 3 years ago, and I was never really indoctrinated into the Evangelical fear of doing anything remotely dogmatic or ""religious,"" so it made joining the Orthodox Church a lot easier."

Heresy was one of the reasons why the Church established and enunciated its doctrine in a very clear and unequivocal way. However, the dogmas decreed by the Councils that opposed heresy are not the only ones promulgated and taught by the Church. The doctrinal system of the Church contains both these dogmas and all the other doctrines that the Church always proclaimed as being part of the message of salvation that she addresses to the world."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dtveb,justsaynotoheresy,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"Specifically, the First Council of Nicaea (325) and the Council of Constantinople (360) were the two councils which together declared  the Trinity to be dogma."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dse8n,durdyg,13,Sun Jul 19 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"so, believe it or not, dating in the Orthodox world is no different than dating anywhere else in Christianity. I'd say it's even more lax with an emphasis in honesty. What I mean by lax is, I remember Protestant circles I was involved in before that were so about the man and the woman's roles within the relationship it was nearly all they talked about! Just with anything in Orthodoxy, a lot of stuff is none of anyone else's business but yours and the Priest's, so there's no ""the man must lead, and the woman must submit"" silliness.   She's a person. You're a person. God made her unique, and you too, so get to know her and be like Christ is to His bridegroom, utterly humble and loving to no end. Don't worry about ""leading"", especially since she's been in the faith way longer than you have. sounds like she would lead you a lot too. I think it's especially when you worry about your roles, that you mess up the natural flow of how to embody them, because you stop listening to the other person, and start trying to follow a stereotype."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dse8n,whole-hearted,2,Sun Jul 19 01:08:40 2015 UTC,"Right on. I've realized that, only I'm worrying about when heavy subjects come about. I know there are somethings we disagree about already (which can be good), only I'm not sure how to handle it. Some things are black and white, you know, and I don't know if or how I should convey that or if she should be subject to change her mind on those things."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dse8n,whole-hearted,3,Sun Jul 19 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"hm...well, you're in a transition right now. i'd say if anyone's mind is changing, it's yours. being a Catechumen is like being steeped. The Orthodox Church is very deep, and the process of becoming Orthodox in heart and mind is a quiet, internal process that takes time and dedicated seeking. It's kinda like waiting for a splinter to push itself out of you. You may have lots of splinters you never knew you had. Don't jump to conclusions just yet about what you believe and what you don't. This is one reason it's hard to start dating while you're in this transition period. You're not fully settled in what you believe yet. If you were, you'd be Chrismated!   I'd suggest keep talking to your priest about those bigger subjects. And, especially with the girl, listen and learn her. Maybe she holds those beliefs for a reason you don't know much about yet, cuz you don't know her much yet. Don't worry about 'uniting your mind' with hers yet. And who knows! Maybe having those kind of big conversations could be good for both of you. Just don't go into it with the mind of ""if I'm right, I have to convince her, and if she's right, I'll have to change."" You're still so early in your relationship with her (even as a friend) and with the Church. Relationships aren't black and white like that.  EDIT* Wait, so you're not a catechumen?"

We only see each other at Church, and only have chance to talk at coffee hour. Sometimes, her family doesn't even stay. I have her number and we text from time to time. I don't want to get too heavy via texts, and I don't necessarily feel comfortable discussing romance at coffee hour. I would have been inclined to start revealing more of my feelings on a friendly date...hence one of my problems. I may just cool off a bit and see how I feel. Maybe she'll strike up communication with me and I'll have a better feel about where she's at."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dse8n,kosmickoyote,2,Sun Jul 19 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"ah. i see. that sounds hard. it's easy for our minds to jump to 'how can i make this work' when we're excited, even if the practicality of it is that your relationship with her isn't there yet. I'd say, cool off with the decisions of 'now I will pursue her more' and 'now i will back off and wait'. Like I told the other guy asking dating advice, relationships are a dance. You can't just decide you're gonna go left if you're partner isn't also willing. And just because you step on her toes, or mess up doesn't mean you gotta stop dancing. Relationships are all around you. You have them as acquaintances, friends, and more. If your spiritual goal is to love everyone, you have to learn that loving, in the outward form of it, is an act of being present and being interested. If she's not willing to go a certain way, that doesn't mean you're not still dancing. She's still your friend/acquaintance. Have patience."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dse8n,_immortal,2,Sun Jul 19 03:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think it is the same as dating anywhere else. You said you have asked her a couple of times.

Also, this fascination with dating a cradle Orthodox is something you need to move past as you are limiting yourself and the person for you may be two pews away but a convert.   You didn't mention ethnicity but it can play a role."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dse8n,_immortal,4,Sun Jul 19 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"How obvious were you? ""Suggested"" is vague.   ""Busy doing something else"" sounds like she's not interested and a typical conflict-avoider, so she's trying to ""give you hints""/""let you down easy.""  That last part is weird. In fact, all of this is weird. Why don't you tell her all of this? Sit down and have an honest conversation with her.  ""Hey, I'm interested in you and would like to get to know you better. Would you like to go out on a date with me?""  And if she keeps blowing you off, then just take it as a signal that she's not interested. Let her figure out what it is she wants."

We seem to have sorted out one of your problems but this remains. It is also one where I am not at all clear what you mean. OK you have opinions, she has opinions, maybe you agree, maybe you don't now what? Some things are natural to talk about, so those will come up.

Maybe it's just my own bias talking, but this business about enforcing ""roles"" like 'the man must lead' (and the corollary that 'the woman must follow') makes me a little uncomfortable. Having some Evangelical-ish background, I understand where it comes from, but it seems to me that there's an easily crossable line in there going from leading to controlling, and that's a problem."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dse8n,CATHOLIC_EXTREMIST,2,Sun Jul 19 12:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, three things:  1) There is a world of difference between ""I can't, but I'm free next week"" and ""Maybe another time."" The first one is a logistical issue. The second one is a no. Invite her to a group thing in a month or so, but probably stop asking her on dates. Most people don't play hard to get. If they do, don't encourage them. Just stop asking.  2) You are a person, not a role. She is a person, not a role. When you get married, there is infinite flexibility in what your lives can look like as long as you are both being loving, honest, and generous. I know one soon-to-be-priest who's a way better housekeeper and cook than his wife, so he does the cooking and cleaning and she works full time. I know priests who've been stay-at-home dads. I know wives who've brought home the bacon so their husbands can write or study. I know wives who balance the checkbooks, have the primary vote in major decisions, and take the lead in family prayer time. It's what they need in their relationships, and often it's not about what they want but what they can offer to their family. All of these couples are working towards their salvation in a church-approved way. Sacrifice is the name of the game.  3) My priest told us (in premarital counseling) that the Protestant understanding of leadership and submission is backwards. They tend to think of a hierarchy: Christ at the top, then the apostles, then the pastors, then the people. It's not, it's an upside-down pyramid. Christ at the bottom. The apostles lean on Christ. The bishops lean on the apostles. The priests lean on the bishops. The people lean on the priests. Wives get to lean on their husbands for support. It isn't about control andâdepending on your individual strengths and needsâit may not even look like steering the ship. It's more about service and martyrdom than anything else."

I know my grandmother only finished through sixth grade, and can barely read and write. She's been Orthodox for, you know, 9 decades (although she definitely espouses some yiayologies :) ).  Most people throughout history have not been literate. That doesn't mean that they were not Orthodox.

I will admit to being a bit sarcastic when I wrote it, mainly because some of the commentary just seems silly to me.

For example, the hymnography always talks about the three hypostases of the Trinity. The poetic hymns donât explain what a hypostasis is, but if you were to read the Dialectica of St. John of Damascus, for example, then you would have a better understanding.  Thereâs a right way and a wrong way of using the Fathers. If youâre using the Fathers more as a club to beat other people with, then youâre doing it wrong."

OrthodoxChristianity,3dqwyh,Atarka_,6,Sun Jul 19 22:10:49 2015 UTC,"An observation of mine from conversations with my orthodox friends is related to this idea. If Sola Scriptura carries with it epistemological problems, then in what sense can those problems be said to vanish when reading the fathers? Who interprets the Fathers, is it the ecumenical councils? Local Presbyters deciding how to interpret and implement the councils seems to struggle with the same problems as Sola Scriptura, namely prooftexting as a means to establish what ""orthodox christianity"" truly is."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dqwyh,asdamick,5,Sat Jul 18 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"This is a great question and very quickly gets into the weeds, because what precisely is mean by sola scriptura will lead to different epistemological problems, some of which are resolved by recourse to a more traditional hermeneutic, but some of which are objections to a traditionali hermeneutic and are resolved outside of that framework. I mean, there's always the pyrrhonian skeptic viewpoint to answer.   I would definitely say that if you just replace a naive sola scriptura which treats the Bible as descending from the sky and one's readings of it in your own tradition are simply the plain meaning of it and not acknowledging the fact that you're in an interpretive tradition, if you just replace that with the Fathers descending from the sky etc etc etc, you're not getting around any of the problems, just kicking the can down the road."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dqwyh,Atarka_,2,Sat Jul 18 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"The way that I try to look at the Fathers isn't as original sources unto themselves, but as guides to the rest of the scriptures.

OrthodoxChristianity,3dqwyh,_immortal,2,Sat Jul 18 18:18:51 2015 UTC,I don't think this should be a controversial claim to be honest.

OrthodoxChristianity,3dqwyh,speudebradeos,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:03 2015 UTC,I have the feeling that some of  people on both sides of the argument are talking past each other more than anything else or not reading charitably as you said. The worry about placing Saints as too low or somehow going against tradition seems to assume that the claim is that they are not focusing on the role Saints have in participating in God's energies (as in the Greek word energia and the concept of coextensive relation and active predication or expression of a property) through their actions and that participation as a source of their role in tradition. It seems they are not though and you have to misread or misinterpret to make that claim .  At the same time the other group seems to have some people who think that people are placing Saints as on the same level of God and not as expressing the energies of God but expressing some special property by themselves. The first group is not claiming that Saints are on the same level of God or their actions are on their own.

Here's a question, though: It is often said that we are to read Scripture through the Fathers. Now, if, as you say, authenticity is proven through Scripture, then do we still need to read the Fathers for that purpose?"
OrthodoxChristianity,3dqwyh,speudebradeos,3,Sat Jul 18 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting sola scriptura, and I'm explicit about that.  My point is simply that quoting Scripture more often than the Fathers is a rather patristic thing to do.  As to what is ""often said"" (by whom?), does that mean that one should not have access to the Scripture without first reading a patristic commentary?  If so, we had been redesign all our church services.  I very much agree that the Fathers are important in terms of understanding the Scripture, but I do not believe it is correct to make reading them a sine qua non for Orthodoxy.  I would say that understanding the Scripture comes through living life in the Church, which may well include significant exposure to the Fathers but, for most Christians, has actually not included that."

I don't know about you, but when I hear pipe organs, the last thing I'm thinking is ""dang, this sounds just like that crazy rave/disco thing."" In fact, the pipe organ is almost exclusively associated with the Church now.  I mean, they sound pretty ugly if done wrong, but they started in the West prior to the schism. Some say the West was gradually building up heresies and innovations, but I don't think the pipe organ can be counted in the leagues of papal supremacy.   De-Hellenization   Doesn't this sound eerily like the Judaizers Paul so passionately fought against, trying to impose their particular culture on all of Christendom? Yes, Greek Philosophy has some stuff that can be seen as a sort of anticipation of Christianity, but so can many other philosophies- The seeds of the Logos are in all of creation.  To me it looks like the only issue here that has any real concern is, if it was an accurate description, ecumenism, but still I really don't think the ecumenism they describe exists within Orthodoxy. I don't see some rush to disregard Tradition and create some religious syncretism thing. Maybe there's a few like that, but I don't see them. I just see people with the will and desire to see one Church engaging in a loving dialogue and trying to see if the other traditions are on the same page as us, and if they aren't, seeing how we can get them there. I haven't seen any Orthodox say that we're all the same or anything like that. I've seen it on the Protestant side, but that's irrelevant."

I believe it is a real miracle personally, but I haven't experienced it myself. It's not that I believe that it couldn't be faked, of course anything could be faked, but there is just too many people who go there every year and come back saying it was a miracle for something to not actually be happening over there.

Do you believe in the immaculate conception?   Not as stated by modern Catholic dogma, but there are some lesser things we agree with.   And what about Marian apparitions?   The Orthodox traditionally have a few of their own in the calendar, like October 1st is the feast of the protection of the Mother of God, where her miraculous intercessions saved the city from invaders.

OrthodoxChristianity,3do9pn,greyandlate,9,Fri Jul 17 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"The Roman Catholic reason for the immaculate conception of Mary is to protect Jesus Christ from the taint of original sin by providing a mother free from original sin. (But if Mary could be conceived without original sin, why is this second degree of separation even necessary?) But from the Orthodox point of view, it is essential that Jesus Christ have exactly the same human nature as you or I, in order to save our nature. So the immaculate conception is unnecessary, either for Christ or Mary.  Another reason that the immaculate conception does not make sense, is that it suggests that Mary's virtuous life is no big deal, since she was born that way. It suggests that Mary is an exception, rather than a model that we can emulate since she was 'made of the same stuff' as you or me."
OrthodoxChristianity,3do9pn,Liempt,3,Sat Jul 18 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"But can any of us do even the smallest good without grace from God - and isn't that what Mary is about?

Christ had to be born subject to the curse of death, in order to defeat death. He received that aspect of the fallen human nature from his earthly Mother, the Theotokos."
OrthodoxChristianity,3do9pn,giziti,3,Sat Jul 18 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"We believe the Mother of God was without sin, but Orthodox theologians have a slightly different understanding of original sin and may therefore quibble with the idea of immaculate conception, as it is the precise nature of the Catholic doctrine of original sin that requires it."
OrthodoxChristianity,3do9pn,likesdarkgreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm Catholic as well, but I'm more interested in the Orthodox view of sin, or original sin if there is at all a sense of it, in the context of Mary as the Mother of God. In other words, how does the Orthodox view of sin affect its theology around Mary?"
OrthodoxChristianity,3do9pn,ki4clz,-3,Sat Jul 18 04:57:48 2015 UTC,"Sin-less... not really...  Freed from sin... more likely... (but so are all of us, through Christ's sacrifice)  Less inclined to sin... surely...  In the Orthodox tradition, sin is not considered to be a normal and natural part of human being and life. To be human and to be a sinner is contradictory. [1 Jn 3:4-10]   so for The Theotokos to have an ""immaculate conception"" is really unnecessary... She (like us) is made in Gods image and therefore the concept of her being born into sin is contradictory to God's creation in the first place... so the idea that The Theotokos needed to be sin-less in order for Christ to be birthed free of sin is moot and rather odd frankly  Not to sin is the goal of human life. But in fact all people do/are capable of sin. It is for this reason that the possibility to be freed from sin and to overcome sin comes through the saving work of Christ, who forgives the sins of the world. [1 Jn 1:8-2:6]  The word fall indicates a movement down and away from an original high and lofty state....  The word stain reveals that there was once an original purity that has been defiled....  The word transgression means a movement against that which is primarily right...  The word guilt reveals prior innocence...   The words estrangement and alienation indicate that one was first âat home,â living in a sound and wholesome condition...   The word deviation means that one has gone off his original way...  The Prodigal HAD his inheritance THEN wastes it...  So you see we are not in sin, we choose to sin..."

It is noteworthy that the documented drafted at that time was certainly influenced by its time. It is not accidental that the document focused on the problem of general disarmament. Today it has to be decided whether the Council should take up a document stamped with so apparent an impact of out-of-date ideological concepts or a new document should be prepared. At the same time, some provisions of the draft document can well be used because the Christian understanding of peace, the dignity of the personality, human freedom and the national issue will always be relevant.

No one would have expected this text to cause such heated discussions among the participants.  As it turned out, the acute divergences were on the subject regarding the rights of sexual minorities. The Metropolitan of Pergamum euphemistically called them âother minoritiesâ which, in his opinion, should be protected from any kind of discrimination and injustice.  âWe have no right to humble and victimize the image of God,â said â according to reliable sources â the 84 years old theology professor, while addressing his âheartlessâ colleagues. âLet us ask ourselves if we need to consider homosexuals scapegoats who deserve to suffer persecution. And if we donât want to establish that these people must be protected, it means that we want to be punish and imprison them.â  Thus the Metropolitan by trying to assume the creed of those who support anti-racism, in fact he supported the anti-Orthodox bill passed by the Greek parliament under pressure of the European Union.  We remember that this bill was the subject of criticism from His Eminence Metropolitan Seraphim of Piraeus and from several other church leaders worthy of respect and with great spiritual authority, that represent the healthy part of Greek society.  But the endeavors to incorporate in the text of the Holy Synod the claim for respect of âminorities of other natureâ and the guarantee to âexpress freely according to their principlesâ, has not been supported by the majority.  Then another âtheologyâ professor, dean of the Orthodox Theological Institute in Chambery, Vlaslios Feidas, in aim to help the Metropolitan Ioannis, stressed:  âThere are sexual minorities, but they are just as we, members of the Orthodox Church. They also participate in the church life. They are sinners, but we are all sinners. The state recognizes them, as respectable members of society, therefore we, in turn, must not ignore them. Sexual sins are under no circumstance the grievous, so we must face the GL community not by conviction, but with love and respect.â  Among the participants there were very few at first to share this position. Conversely, the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church, lead by Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev, absolutely disagreed. This position of respect for homosexual communities and their protection against persecution, would neither be endorsed by the Patriarchate of Antioch, nor by Metropolitan Basil in Syria, where Christians suffer severe persecution because of their faith, nor by Metropolitan of Montenegro Amfilohios, who courageously resisted the âGay Pride Festivalâ in the capital city of his country, nor by the other hierarchs.  The 7 hours intense psychological coercion practiced by the Chairman of the Committee on the participants who did not let go the subject, resulted in a compromise amendment that âsexual minorities should not be discriminated against, and this will not imply that others share their opinions and principles.â  All Greek hierarchies including Metropolitan Ignatius of Demetriates voted this amendment, to our great sorrow and shame. Bishop Ignatius alleged that in Greece âthe supporters of Nazi ideologyâ is attacking the sexual minorities.  The amendment was also voted by the Metropolitan Chrysostomos of Messina, Bishop George of Paphos (Cyprus), Archbishop Aristarchus of Constantia (Patriarchate of Jerusalem) and the Metropolitan Sergei of Good Hope (the Patriarchate of Alexandria).  The compromise of shame was strongly opposed by Metropolitans Hilarion, Basil and Amfilohios (mentioned above), but also by the hierarchs representing Serbian, Bulgarian, Georgian and Romanian Orthodox Churches.  All these hierarchs, to their honor, have not changed their position and because of them, the awaited revision of Orthodox theology to protect homosexuals has not been accomplished. Thanks to their firm opposition, the revised text will not be submitted to Great Synod next year."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dmt08,justsaynotoheresy,3,Fri Jul 17 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"This can't be the reason for the ROC's rejection of the document, since the article clearly implied no language about homosexuality was added."

While some might find that harsh, I think it will actually provide pastors more freedom to minister to homosexuals.

Obviously quoting Protestants is fine, but it feels a bit odd when the heresy propagated isn't addressed, but is left to stand.

Fr. Gregory Jensen February 4, 2015 at 1:30 PM  To the observation about straw man arguments let me add the author's preference for making process comments rather than substantive comments. He describes social dynamics instead of offering actual examples of what he does--and doesn't--mean by fundamentalism.  This is rhetorical device borrowed from psychotherapy. In that context, describing people's behavior can often be very helpful in bring to light what is often the conflict between intention and action. In a therapeutic context and in the hands of a technically skilled and ethical therapist, this can serve to help a person changed fixed and unhealthy patterns of thought, speak and action. But make no mistake, the GOAL of process comments is to break down a person's self-image.  Process comments create critical distance by fostering doubt of what was hitherto unquestioned. Applying process comments to the dogmatic or moral tradition of the Church will, I'm afraid, have the same consequence--it will foster disbelief, or at least mistrust, in the tradition.  Make no mistake, there are those in the Church who would like to see us move away from the tradition of the Church in favor of the tradition of secularism and moral progressivism. No matter how well meaning the author, process comments like what we see in this (and other recent) blog posts are simply not in the service of the Gospel.  Once again, an official website has been used to promote an message contrary to the faith."

Marriage is not for the express purpose of producing children, although we should desire to have children, as they are a blessing from God. Marriage is for mutual theosis.

Then I'll think about it some more, maybe I can recall some quote or some words that have been passed to me, that I can pass along, that might bring comfort to the person who sent me something. Then, I'll type up a response, usually a shortened version of the prayer I said for them, and pass it along to them. Then in the evenings, if time permits. I open up these threads, and pray over all the requests again, during my evening prayer time. So, I am not typing things out and believing that it is prayer. I think you are misunderstanding me, and very well could imply I need to change my wording. For assuredly, I am not trying to encourage people to wish for evil or sinful things. What I am trying to encourage is for people to feel like they can repent of anything. Some people trap themselves in a corner and tell themselves other shouldn't pray for them, for they view themselves as evil.

Perhaps a bit of re-wording would come off differently and less like a ""reddit prayer"".  It is definitely a case of misunderstanding though.  Forgive me again. Definitely a misunderstanding here.  I wonder if a weekly post titled something like ""Weekly prayer request thread"" with a text along the lines of ""Post your fears, your pains, your suffering and your worries.  No one is too sinful for prayer, and no one will judge your struggles.""  Something like that would be a little clearer, I think.   And maybe other people could upvote the requests after they have prayed about them.  This would let the person know that they are, in fact, being prayed for, but the people doing to praying would be less tempted to boast about praying for others like leaving a comment might.

You should generally not be required to be rebaptized, but there are some silly people. Generally, it should take about a year to become Orthodox.

The Orthodox Church does not have a developed âJust Warâ theory. Traditionally, soldiers who have killed in battle were penanced, showing that war was not necessarily an absolute good, but more like something that is tolerated for the sake of the defense of the nation.   I have been Baptized, but not confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church, would I need to be re-baptized(assuming not), or since the baptism is Trinitarian in nature, would it be considered valid?   It depends on the jurisdiction, ask the priest.   How long would it take for me to receive Chrismation after inquiry?   Depends on the priest. It is better not to rush.   I've been reading 'The Orthodox Church' by Timothy Ware, and Way of the Pilgrim, and I happened upon a reference to Hesachasym, and I was curious if this is a practice reserved for monastics, or is it practiced by the laity as well?   Hesychasm, defined as the higher levels of contemplative prayer, is practiced mainly in monasteries, because of the conducive environment of the monastery. However, it is not restricted to monks, but beginners in the faith need to work on the lower levels of the spiritual life, basic things such as the virtues (and, perhaps, even more basic things like social graces and politeness).   Last question, would I be in for a big culture shock from a traditional Roman Catholic mass to a Greek Orthodox Mass?

It's hard to address your concern without addressing some of what you said.  If you're atheist, the concept of sin is totally arbitrary. Therefore, even if you dislike your father's approach, you can't take the high ground without aligning yourself with a high ground.  On the flip side, if your father is drilling the principles of Christianity into you and your sister while simultaneously despising or dismissing those outside the faith, there is a MAJOR disconnect: ""If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love, I am like a ringing gong or a clanging cymbal."" PLEASE realize that what your father is forcing on you isn't Christian faith. It's a scholastic rulebook devoid of Christ's love.  I urge you to try and explore who Jesus Christ actually is and what it means to love. I think you're already on the right track in seeing your father's pride for what it is, but don't be led into the pit of irreligious nihilism by that.  That said, I converted to Orthodoxy from a Protestant background. My parents to this day are upset about it. I am fine with that because as important as they are, Truth is more important.

On the flip side, now that I'm a parent, I'm much more sympathetic to my mom's reaction than I was when I went through the ordeal. You (general you) raise your children teaching them what you sincerely believe to be true, and when they choose for themselves as everyone must, you hope they choose what you've chosen. Why wouldn't you? You believe it's the truth.  Anyway! I don't think quoting scripture to him is going to be helpful. You can tell him that you appreciate the values he has raised you with, but there's no telling how it will go. All you can do is be honest, and try to be patient with him if he reacts badly.

But even more importantly who can say what they will be like in the future, 10 years from now? Or 20 years from now? This is why it is a good idea not to burn any bridges, and not to make any definitive statements about who and what you are today. You didn't always know you would feel the way you do today, and you don't know how you will feel in the future. It is more accurate to say ""this is the way you feel today"", that is a truthful statement, and your father should respect your feelings.

Either way, honesty typically leads to more honesty. It starts an avalanche towards Truth.

You're clearly an adult, and some parents need extreme situations to humble them to see they are not in control of anyone but themselves. If they hate that, that's their own problem, and God is merciful if they want out of hatred.  As people have commented on here already, don't stop seeking Truth. I get you're satisfied with being away from the 'faith' you were raised in, but don't stop looking for understanding of this world: why you do what you do, and what love, selflessness, life, and death are.

OrthodoxChristianity,3dbvad,silouan,6,Wed Jul 15 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"Re: ""Economy""   Our love for those outside of the Church, and our acknowledgement of the working of God outside the Church, cannot change His commandment to us, which is to go and to baptize.  Now, if there are circumstances where, out of economy, the Church says âin this case we will receive by chrismation,â for circumstances specific to this person and not as a global ruleâalright. It is within the purview of the hierarchy to exercise this grace, this economy.    This rather contradicts his earlier statement:   Clearly, from the canonical point of view, there is a straightforward pattern in the canons of the Church for different types of reception, based on the circumstances through which they come to the Churchâthere are certain conditions in which baptism is absolutely required, there are certain conditions in which chrismation may be performed, a baptism having already been performed, etc. There are responses to apostasy, to schism, etc. The canonical tradition is clear.   If economy means an exception to the canons (a meaning which is actually not what is supported in the canons themselves, which often use economy to refer both to strictness and leniency), then how can it be ""economy"" to follow the letter of the canons in chrismating certain converts?  The canons don't say ""baptize everyone, but you can make some exceptions.""  They instead say (in essence) ""baptize everyone who has not truly been baptized.""  If all people who have not received baptism within the canonical boundaries of Orthodoxy are not truly baptized, you can't use ""economy"" to say that they don't have to be baptized.  But the canons themselves assume that some people baptized outside those boundaries are in fact truly baptized, else they would insist on baptism for everyone, no matter what."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dbvad,asdamick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure establishing a practice as locally normal or locally acceptable makes it any less an economia.   Maybe you've already read the letter of St Basil to Amphilochius, Bishop of Iconium, about how to receive into communion with the Church converts who have received a form of baptism outside the Church.   The Cathari are schismatics... because the origin of separation arose through schism, and those who had apostatized from the Church had no longer on them the grace of the Holy Spirit, for it ceased to be imparted when the continuity was broken...  They who were broken off had become laymen, and, because they are no longer able to confer on others that grace of the Holy Spirit from which they themselves are fallen away, they had no authority either to baptize or to ordain. And therefore those who were from time to time baptized by them, were ordered, as though baptized by laymen, to come to the church to be purified by the Churchâs true baptism. Nevertheless, since it has seemed to some of those of Asia that, for the sake of management of the majority, their baptism should be accepted, let it be accepted.    First he says that the Cathars have no Holy Spirit to give, so they can have no baptism or priesthood, so they have always been received by true baptism. But then he adds that if this is a problem, then the Church should  accept the Cathars' ""baptism.""   Then he describes:   the iniquitous action of the Encratites; who, in order to shut themselves out from being received back by the Church have endeavoured for the future to anticipate readmission by a peculiar baptism of their own... My opinion, therefore, is that nothing being distinctly laid down concerning them, it is our duty to reject their baptism, and that in the case of any one who has received baptism from them, we should, on his coming to the church, baptize him. If, however, there is any likelihood of this being detrimental to general discipline, we must fall back upon custom, and follow the fathers who have ordered what course we are to pursue. For I am under some apprehension lest, in our wish to discourage them from baptizing, we may, through the severity of our decision, be a hindrance to those who are being saved.   On every ground let it be enjoined that those who come to us from their baptism be anointed in the presence of the faithful, and only on these terms approach the mysteries.    Again, he ays the Encratites' ""baptism"" is intentionally not a baptism into the Church and ""it is our duty to reject their baptism."" But, again, even though the Encratites have intentionally not baptized anyone into the Church, if baptizing them causes trouble, then simply chrismate them!  Basil clearly has a lot of faith in the grace of God to make people communicants of the Orthodox Church despite converts' never having received a true baptism.  Then he adds as a footnote:   I am aware that I have received into episcopal rank Izois and Saturninus from the Encratite following. I am precluded therefore from separating from the Church those who have been united to their company, inasmuch as, through my acceptance of the bishops, I have promulgated a kind of canon of communion with them.   On one hand he echoes St Cyprian that there are no sacraments outside the Church; then by economia he receives bishops in their rank from a group that had no authority to ordain them in the first place. Wouldnt that be scandalous today! Imagine receiving Anglican bishops, as bishops, into the Orthodox Church. Basil is willing to ""bind and loose"" and admit people to Communion and to the clergy based on what will doscourage or encourage converts; but his exercise of episcopal authority in economia doesn't confuse him about the fact that Cathars and Encratites simply are not yet baptized and on princple their ""sacraments"" should be rejected.  This letter stands out to me because it's personal correspondence. He can speak freely because he isn't establishing canons or writing ex cathedra; he's advising his friend Bishop Amphilochius regarding his own approach to the question.  When Baptist baptize ""in the name of the Father and the Son and teh Holy Spirit"" but do so intentionally not perfoming any sacrament (that was certainly the case in my experience) and then they want to be received into the Church then Basil's thoughts on the Encratites seem very relevant. And when Lutherans, who have no apostolic succession, want to enter the Church, then it's worth looking at Basil's response to the gnostic Cathars (who were much farther from Christian faith than any Lutheran I know of.)"

I believe I mentioned this to Jesse, the interviewer, earlier and didn't get a satisfactory response, but he continues on in this line of questioning (he is alluding to Archbishop Lazar), but it seems to me the argument is that brains exhibit sexual dimorphism and the brains of transgender individuals seem to exhibit some of the opposite features - so the question isn't a sort of mind-body Gnosticism, since it is aspects of the physical body itself that are conflicting. These are both empirical and bioethical questions and hardly so readily dismissed as ""Gnosticism"" - as Archimandrite Irenei notes that bioethical issues are new."

OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,Spazm0deus,11,Wed Jul 15 15:03:47 2015 UTC,The first rule of fasting rule is not to talk about your fasting rule.
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,aletheia,3,Wed Jul 15 21:57:02 2015 UTC,"That's not true...Orthodox Christians talk about fasting all the time to each other.  He's not asking if you have sinned and the priest has given you a special epitimia.  In that case, yes, you dont go around sharing that.  But he's not asking that...nor is he asking so that he may brag over you and neither should you brag about what you're doing.  Here's an example of good and bad answer to his question:  Good = ""Traditionally in the Church we do this......"" Bad = ""I do this and this makes me better than you....""  He's looking for clarification/edification not your weekly confession."
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,WARLORD_MWO,2,Thu Jul 16 03:13:58 2015 UTC,"So someone notices you fasting and asks you about it do you run away screaming ""I'm not allowed to talk About it!""?"
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,aletheia,3,Thu Jul 16 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"I don't go into specifics of my rule, or what rules I may happen to be neglecting/bending at that moment. My actual discipline is between me and my priest. A few close confidants may know a fair amount when it is particularly edifying, or if we find ourselves in a situation where we're eating together often. For example, boyfriends/girlfriends/husbands/wives/roommates.  When people notice that I'm eating vegetarian/vegan, I don't make a big deal of it. I accept the friendly jabs that come my way. A couple of days ago I asked at a catered event if there were any vegetarian options. They said ""No"" and I took the meaty sandwich. The only explanation I gave is that I'm ""not an ethical vegetarian, so don't feel bad"" and went about my day.  Lent is slightly different insofar as it's more likely that others may pick up that my diet has changed. Particularly when the fast is over and they see me go back to a less restrictive diet. I'll answer generic questions about fasting if they come up, but I don't go into specifics if I can avoid it."
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,aletheia,3,Thu Jul 16 12:57:56 2015 UTC,So which do you think is more prideful?   Talking about your fasting or talking about how you don't talk about your fasting?
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,aletheia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"I don't see why either is inherently prideful, much less one more than the other."
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,Prof_Acorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:53:44 2015 UTC,Well it's my understanding that I  do not talk about fasting because i  do not want to become proud of my fasting.  So whether I'm proud of myself for fasting or for not talking about my fasting it is the same trap.
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,thephotoman,2,Thu Jul 16 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"I look more at asking about someone else's fasting rule as being akin to asking for their medical history. It's no one's business except the person, their doctor, and the people they trust.  Certainly pride is crouching at the door here and it is perhaps worth mentioning, but I don't see it as any more or less risky than pride waiting for us in other contexts where we may brag or feel ashamed."
OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,candlesandfish,6,Thu Jul 16 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"From what I understand we do not choose our own fasting guidelines, but work with a priest in determining how much of the prescribed fasting rules will challenge us but actually be attainable. The goal, of course, is no animal products, oil, or wine, but this level of fasting is too difficult for many people, so it's a pastoral issue.  When sharing what we fast, it's likely that whoever is doing more will likely feel proud because of it, and whoever is doing less will likely feel like they aren't really fasting because of it. All the while we don't know where people are at in the journey the way a priest would in determining if we can follow the prescription or not."

OrthodoxChristianity,3ddz9d,LuluThePanda,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"Orthodox fasting rules are NOT personal.  Fasting rules are VERY prescriptive in the Canons.  That means no meat, dairy, olive oil, fish, shellfish and sexual relations during fast days.  There are certain fast days that fish, shellfish and oil is permitted (Feast days during a fast).  However there are very strict oikinomia that is made by the priest due to allergies, illness, etc..  @ Spazm0deus - It is important to know that generally Orthodox Christians are hesitant to share our fasting practices because of fear.  Fear that we may fall into the sin of pride/vanity (The parable of the Publican and the Pharisee).  In addition ""fasting"" is not just fasting from food.  A person may be fasting from other things as well, namely sexual relations with their wife/husband and are not permitted to share.  Having said that, rather than posting, ""We dont share our fasting rules.""  People should never have posted in the first place."

OrthodoxChristianity,3dc80i,river_of_peace,2,Wed Jul 15 07:03:16 2015 UTC,"This is also something I was confused about at first, maybe I'm still confused who knows, but from what I understand there is the Jesus prayer which is just simply repeating the words ""Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me"" or some variation of that. Anyone can do such a prayer.   But then there is the type of the Jesus prayer as practised in a monastery as part of an entire lifestyle regime. This would be dangerous for someone to try to do on their own without the guidance of a spiritual father."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dc80i,WARLORD_MWO,3,Wed Jul 15 23:12:33 2015 UTC,"Having been a novice at an Orthodox monastery I can tell you that they are one and the same.  At the monastery we were taught that the Jesus Prayer serves many purposes (for both a monk and as a layperson).  The first is to focus the mind.  When a person says (in their head) ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me"" the mind is forced to focus on the words you are trying to say and becomes less apt to wander into sinful thoughts.  The second purpose is to cleanse the soul.  After much practice (under the guidance of a spiritual father) a layperson and the monk will be able to move the focus of the prayer being said in their head to the prayer being said in their heart.  That is the goal: To say the Jesus Prayer within the heart.  This is not an easy task as it requires an immense amount of UNDISTRACTED focus on the prayer.  The only difference between a layperson and a monk is the distraction factor.  Monks have no CORPREAL distraction only INCORPREAL (the demons).  Whereas a layperson has many corpreal (kids, job etc...) distractions AND incorpreal (demons) to contend with.  So the prayer and how it should be prayed are the same for both the monk and the layperson.  We had MANY, MANY lay people come to the monastery to learn how to pray the Jesus Prayer, and they were taught exactly the same way the monks were.  TLDR: Monks and lay people are taught exactly the same way.  The only difference is monks have less distraction than laypeople which allows the monks to spiritually excel much quicker."
OrthodoxChristianity,3dc80i,river_of_peace,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:43:18 2015 UTC,I can tell you that they are one and the same   Maybe at the initiate level.
OrthodoxChristianity,3dc80i,WARLORD_MWO,4,Thu Jul 16 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"You're correct...as a monk deepens his communion with God and the soul is purified by the prayer, the Jesus prayer becomes a fiery sword a monk wields to fend off demonic attacks.  Additionally, once the prayer is brought into the heart, a person is then able to truly understand when King David said: ""How sweet are Thy words, yea sweeter than honey to my mouth"" (Psalm 119).  This is very difficult to achieve as a layperson.  In many ways a monk far surpasses what a layperson can possibley achieve, most especially with the Jesus Prayer.    But the monk and the layperson are both taught the same fundamentals regarding the prayer (focus, concentration-recall, thought-blocking and proper breathing).  Those are the fundamentals.  You sit in a relatively comfortable chair (not too comfortable or you'll fall asleep) in a room with the lights off.  You close your eyes.  The prayer rope is held in the left hand (so that the right hand is free to make the Sign of the Cross if needed).  As a person breathes in through their nose you say to in your mind ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God"".  Then you breathe out through your nose and you say in your mind ""have mercy on me.""  Then you keep doing that over and over with each passing knot.  When thoughts come into the mind (which they most certainly will) you make the Sign of the Cross and recall your concentration to the words of the prayer.  If lights, or voices, or images come to mind these are DEMONIC distractions.  Our Lord Jesus Christ and his heavenly hosts would not want to distract you from His beautiful prayer, that is how you know ALL distractions are demonic.  I cannot emphasize enough: You MUST have a spiritual father guiding you.  It is VERY easy for a person to fall into prelest if they are not properly trained.  There are countless stories of how demons have presented themselves as angels of light praising the person how wonderful and holy they are.  That they have achieved so much holiness in such a short time....This is where the spiritual father comes in to remind you that you're just a lowly monk/layperson who is unworthy to even look upon the icon of Christ, let alone be visited by one of His angels.  Humility, patience, etc...is what the spiritual father is there to help you with =)"
OrthodoxChristianity,3dc80i,river_of_peace,2,Thu Jul 16 03:03:08 2015 UTC,Well said. There is of course variations between different approaches but that sounds generally true.

The people that the label is usually thrown at are Elder Ephraim of Arizona and his followers as well as a few corners of ROCOR.  These groups are more strict in their applications of the canons of the church than the people throwing the label around prefer.  I also find it interesting that the people that use the label ""fundamentalist"" are almost invariably both Greek and American.  I'm not really sure what to make of it."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,thephotoman,3,Tue Jul 14 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"Well, when American, Greek, and Russian groups start to disagree on things, I have to wonder how much is Orthodoxy being discussed and how much is cultural overtones being imported into the American religious landscape.   Weather it's diasporic parishes resulting from immigration or whatever, the truth of the matter is that Orthodoxy should spread from mission work with ONE BISHOP PER REGION.  The jurisdictional issues in America should not be happening. Period. We need an established American Orthodox Church with proper jurisdiction. Everything else is merely convoluting the situation. ROCOR and GOCOG and AOCOA and whatever else should back away and allow the OCA to function autonomously as it should."

And all parties to the conversation seemed to agree that the Church needs no unthoughtful and reactionary permissiveness, just as it needs no unthoughtful and reactionary strictness.    Both are quite empty, and abdications of the responsibility to truly understand the Faith and engage in the process of translation that's necessary for any sort of evangelical effort."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,thephotoman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:15 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, it does.  There is also a trend in some circles to get a little lost in the rules, particularly morality (which is easy to get lost in).  That would also be a kind of fundamentalism, though I'd suggest that the key for those people is pastoral guidance to ensure they get a stronger balance of what the faith is about.  But my issue is that ""fundamentalism"" still gets thrown about as a derogatory label too often, and within an Orthodox context, it's nigh meaningless.  At least in Protestantism, you have a few books by self-confessed fundamentalists that actually attempt to lay out what Protestant fundamentalism is (and ultimately, it's an ecumenical reductionist movement with a more literalist interpretation of Scripture)."

Orthodoxy has not made that question its own."" If we're discussing something, Orthodox Christian to Orthodox Christian, then it is a question we as a community have decided to tackle."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,kadmij,2,Tue Jul 14 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"Well, it's reacting by rejecting the present in favor of a constructed past."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,giziti,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, though that word has a specifically political implication and while there is some overlap (unfortunately) I don't want to imply a link."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,speudebradeos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:19:56 2015 UTC,Sure. I don't mean to imply a  link.
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,Moonpi314,3,Tue Jul 14 18:23:41 2015 UTC,"I recall there being a discussion here when the blogs in question were first published, but I wonder what people think about the conversation on AFR."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,williamofgellone,5,Tue Jul 14 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"Earlier in the year one of Kevin's guests, Dr George E Demacopolous, wrote on the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese blog that through the increasing expansion of 'Orthodox fundamentalism' in ordinary parishes, ""the entire Orthodox Church is at risk of being hijacked by extremists"". Father John Whiteford, ROCOR priest and blogger wrote a robust rebuttal to this article. On this episode of Ancient Faith Today Kevin discusses with his guests their views of 'Orthodox fundamentalism': what it is, whether it truly exists and what impact it is having on the Orthodox Church today."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,justsaynotoheresy,2,Tue Jul 14 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"Another Demacopoulos statement that was problematic, he stressed that we should be looking at Christianity in the light of today's philosophers.  Let's compare that to Paul's letter to the Galatians, where in 4:3 he compares our state of childishness when in bondage under the elements of the world.  The note in the Orthodox Study Bible says that the elements of the world are the philosophies and traditions developed by humanity without regard to God, and references Col 2:8.  Colossians 2:8   Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ.   The Orthodox Study Bible specifically notes that principles of the world refers to several things, including    (4) human traditions opposed to God's tradition.   Emphasis above was in the original and not added by me.    Came up in this morning's reading and seemed appropriate to add here."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,speudebradeos,4,Wed Jul 15 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"I can't recall when this was, perhaps during his commentary on the Cappadocian Fathers?  I took Professor D to be saying that we need to understand Christianity in light of current thought if we're to have any hope of explaining the Faith to people who subscribe to current thought.  That's why St Basil needed to have a classical education, and use Hellenistic philosophical language, to communicate the Gospel to his contemporaries.    And that's why we need to have at least some understanding of Nietszsche and Hiedegger and Hume and Freud and etc if we're going to be able to present the Gospel to our contemporaries in ways they can understand.  I think this is pretty central to his take on fundamentalism."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,earlgrhaay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, there are a handful of Orthodox who scorn the present and long for an idealized bygone era, or take the view that everything that needs saying has already been said.  But that's a red herring.  Most everyone agrees that new situations may require the Church to apply tradition in new ways.  The real issues are what is the tradition and how to apply it.  However, ""Orthodox sola scriptura"" is not the answer.  Patristic writing is like Scripture -- without the context of Tradition, it's all mental rock polishing.  Examples include ""same sex marriage in the early church,"" or whatever latest incarnation of feminist theology cryptically laying the groundwork for female ordination, or Protestants citing Church fathers to condemn incense burning."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,speudebradeos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:38 2015 UTC,"This was really interesting to listen to and I thought Prof. Demacopoulos made a great case for a living, breathing tradition. Holy Tradition, with all of its squabbles, disagreements, and, ultimately, the guidance of the Holy Spirit, is what we are still participating in today. There was no point at which all theological questions were settled.  I'm having a hard time articulating exactly where Prof. Demacopoulos and Fr. Whiteford disagree, though, when you get right down to it. Anyone want to take a shot at articulating that?  There were a few points of engagement I would note:   On certain outdated canons, Prof. Demacopoulos would revise them, while for Fr. Whiteford it is enough to re-interpret them, leaving the text as it is. Prof. Demacopoulos makes the point that St. Gregory the Theologian rejected the Second Ecumenical Council; the implication being that the Fathers disagreed quite a lot and so it is not beyond us to question them on certain issues. Fr. Whiteford's response was that in this particular instance, the Church's doctrine simply became more precise, but did not change. Prof. Demacopoulos brings up the Volos conference, which drew seemingly ridiculous accusations of heresy. Fr. Whiteford responds that, although there was ""nuance"", there were certain ""red flags"" that ""set people off.""   Taken as a whole, it does seem as though Prof. Demacopoulos is advocating more of a ""participation"" approach to Tradition, while Fr. Whiteford is advocating more of a ""protection"" approach. The reaction to modernity is therefore different. Prof. Demacopoulos would have us engage, while Fr. Whiteford, though he does not disparage engagement, per se, admits that he does see Christianity as ""under siege.""  Those are my impressions, but please correct me if I've misread the debate.  EDIT: clarity"
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,kadmij,2,Tue Jul 14 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"Yes! It seems Fr. Whiteford thinks the church is more 'under siege' now than it has been in the past, while Prof. Demacopoulos thinks the church is in no more danger now than it has been in the past. The dangers are just different. Although I may have misread as well."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,Pinkfish_411,8,Tue Jul 14 21:49:58 2015 UTC,"The assumption that ""code words"" are being used or that your interlocutors do not mean what they say or are not engaging honestly makes constructive discussion impossible, don't you think?"
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,giziti,5,Tue Jul 14 18:20:47 2015 UTC,He seemed quite forthright about his answers to the questions posed to him.
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,speudebradeos,4,Tue Jul 14 18:49:18 2015 UTC,Being a bishop does not preclude the possibility that one is also a fool.
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,Pinkfish_411,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"I listened to it and drifted in and out so I missed where a bishop was called a fool (at least, in so many words). Did you catch it? It was probably in one of two places - there was some bishop that Whiteford pointed out was an Old Calendarist bishop (so it wouldn't count, not being a real seated bishop) or the Greek metropolitan who has an allergic reaction to the theological conference - in which case your assessment may hold."
OrthodoxChristianity,3d9254,OntologicalAbsurdity,2,Tue Jul 14 21:02:05 2015 UTC,It was the Greek metropolitan.
