WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,FoxtrotZero,4,Tue Jul 21 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously. Didn't the Navy recently publish a goal for the next few years on how many ships they want? It was in the realm of 200."
WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,ruperthackedmyphone,5,Tue Jul 21 14:41:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's called Future Navy 2025 and in a nutshell it is looking at how the Navy will operate in 10 years. This includes all the hardware such as QEC and T26 but more specifically, the people and support to operate this new kit. Not sure how well known this is but the Navy are seriously struggling for manpower in some branches. The figure of 200 ships seems a bit high as our current fleet is 79. I don't imagine that number will ever rise above 100 again as we are growing more integrated with NATO services.    Edit: removed a word"

I think I read somewhere that the Navy has a seriously low re-enlistment rate, and all signs point to ""there's a lot of really gruelling manual labor involved"" as the main reason.  There's a lot of what would be ""down time"", but there's a lot of things required to keep a ship functioning properly, and I guess people get tired of scraping paint and barnacles.

Potent against whom and for what strategic reason?     Am Canadian and i think we are embarrassingly at the other end of the spectrum, but at the end of the day the USN is just so overwhelming that I struggle to see much value other than reasonable capability to assert sovereignty (more of an issue in Canada given size and disputed arctic claims) and various missions that don't really involve confronting other surface combatants (eg, supporting humanitarian missions, interdiction patrols, and securing supply for land missions)."
WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,snusmumrikan,7,Tue Jul 21 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"Because that's a viewpoint rooted in the relatively safe and predictable current naval situation.    Reasonable capacity to assert sovereignty   What does this mean, scaring away Spanish boats from Gibraltar? You never get a second chance at being prepared for a major conflict, and the idea that Britain doesn't need to maintain its ability to protect and project its interests across the oceans is very short sighted.   You only have to go back 30 years to see how quickly that kind of thinking came close to being ruinous. HMS Invincible was almost sold to Australia, labeled superfluous and wasteful for the Royal Navy, with the sale agreed by the MoD. 2 weeks later Invincible was an integral part of the Falklands task force that Britain only just managed to scrape together. The US was nowhere to be seen because of their own continental obligations.  Even more recently, if someone had said to you 5 years ago 'Russia is going to invade Ukraine with tanks and no one will do anything about it' you'd probably have told them they didn't have a clue about what they were saying.   With the US focusing on the Pacific theatre and grumbling about EU allies taking the piss by relying on them for all defense spending (only 5 other nato members met their defense obligations last year), I can't imagine a situation where a strong navy is not beneficial to Britain. The risk of not having one is too high.  Edit: spelling"
WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,ChornWork2,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"the idea that Britain doesn't need to maintain its ability to protect and project its interests across the oceans is very short sighted.   It's an allocation of finite resources... is the british navy better suited to be centered around two STOVL carriers, or would 3-4 Juan Carlos give more flexibility and capability, while saving some coin for land/air forces.  What navy is Britain going to fight where the USN doesn't have skin in the game?  Like Argentina, perhaps the UK is fine with less of a navy than it had in the 80s...   Even more recently, if someone had said to you 5 years ago 'Russia is going to invade Ukraine with tanks and no one will do anything about it' you'd probably have told them they didn't have a clue about what they were saying.   No where did I suggest cutting spending, I was questioning the strategy behind allocation of spending... if you are worried about a confrontation with Russia, EU nations don't need to be spending on naval power IMHO.   I can't imagine a situation where a strong navy is not beneficial to Britain   Sure, but its a question of priority. IMHO dollars spend on land and air forces are more likely to be relevant.  Sure the UK is a special consideration as an island, but is the Falklands really the type of conflict you expect to be fighting in the future?"
WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,snusmumrikan,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"but how important do you think having a 'potent' RN is? Potent against whom and for what strategic reason?    That doesn't align with proposing 4 Juan Carlos style ships. The cost for which would be prohibitive. Building a bigger carrier isn't much more expensive (the systems and sensors are expensive, not the steel of making a bigger carrier) yet gives the opportunity for more marines, more planes, more helicopters and an overall increase in sortie rate. Smaller carriers are more expensive for the capability we would get, and slower. We would also have to build, maintain and crew more than double the amount of supporting & resupply vessels for a lower ability to project force. The UK doesn't have the submarine or destroyer numbers for that many carrier groups, we can just about handle 2.   The RN has been sadly maligned over more than a decade of land warfare. The RAF has had the benefit of sympathetic ears in Whitehall, and the Army has received most of what it needs because of the constant action it has been seeing, and rightly so.    but is the Falklands really the type of conflict you expect to be fighting in the future?   We didn't expect to be fighting it in 1980. Most studies state that it would be incredibly difficult for Argentina to occupy those islands again, but if they did, it would be almost impossible for the UK to win them back again. We need a potent RN for its capability as well as its deterrent. Again my point is that you don't get a second chance at being able to respond to a major conflict. We will likely spend the next 10 years fighting COIN conflicts in the middle east (which will benefit hugely from having the QE class parked off the coast), but it would be foolish to plan the maximum capability of our forces at that level."
WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,ChornWork2,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"I said 3-4 for a reason, depending on spending elsewhere.  But the QECs build cost is apparently GBP6.2bn compared to EUR462mm for a Juan Carlos... assuming wikipedia's numbers are correct, the 2 QECs cost the same as 19 JCs.  Lower projected force?  For what role... different force projection b/c amphibious capability.  And more flexible b/c else have one carrier in one place versus 2 smaller vessels.  I like navy ships b/c i think they are cool and interesting, and the history of naval warfare is awesome.  I just doubt it will be as relevant going forward.  Argentina, like many countries, basically doesn't have a navy anymore.  If you're worried about keeping the falklands, you don't need carriers, you need 500 british marines vacationing there at any given time... and maybe a half dozen f35s.  EDIT: and on the fleet strength point, totally agree you can't support 4 carriers, and that is not what i proposed.  Rather than concept of 2 carrier battle groups you have 3-4 smaller task forces that aren't necessarily expected to operate around the globe independently.  US ESGs don't have same support group as US CBGs."
WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,the_leander,4,Tue Jul 21 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"But the QECs build cost is apparently GBP6.2bn compared to EUR462mm for a Juan Carlos... assuming wikipedia's numbers are correct, the 2 QECs cost the same as 19 JCs.   That number includes all the upgrades needed to our ports and building facilities in order to assemble the vessels.   You're also failing to take into account the cost of manning not only the carriers, the cost of building, manning and maintaining all the extra vessels in the supply chain (which would be ruinous on it's own) or the fact you'd need around a half dozen of them to match the air wing of one QE.   Sure, you could be in more places at once. But you couldn't afford to operate enough vessels of the JC class in order to make up the shortfall VS QE.    If you're worried about keeping the falklands, you don't need carriers, you need 500 british marines vacationing there at any given time... and maybe a half dozen f35s.   The Falklands is but one area of concern and having a ready to roll carrier strike force is a damned useful deterrent.   Rather than concept of 2 carrier battle groups you have 3-4 smaller task forces that aren't necessarily expected to operate around the globe independently.   Except with the US looking to back up it's allies in the Pacific, we cannot expect to have that backup since the rest of the European navies combined top out at around what the current Royal Navy has now.

That said, at least to date the role our men and women have played seem to have held in relatively reasonable regard by allied nations due to their character, capability and resolve.  Our warships are junk (and now without support vessels are worthless independent of allied vessels)  We're borrowing tanks to make deployments, not sure our LAVs are fit for deployment in an environment with an enemy with real AT capabilities, I'm not aware how we'd intend to defend them versus aircraft, and our artillery is all towed... so completely dependent on our allies unless deploying against undeveloped world  Air force is relying on the F35... beyond that programs problems, there's still the question of whether it is actually reasonably suited to the needs of the RCAF..."

If it's the first then I agree but I wouldn't agree with the second :   Our warships are junk   They're not junk...or at least they weren't. They were fairly capable ships that enforced our sovereignty and aided our allies in their more combat oriented missions. They kinda suck today because they're old as fuck. Which is why I think you brought it up in reference to procurement. New ships should have been hitting the waters 5-6 years ago not when some of our warships are literally falling apart.   We're borrowing tanks   Well that one is more difficult to argue for because I see DOD's reasoning behind doing it the way they did. We were originally going to buy Strykers from the Americans but then Afghanistan happened and we deployed with the Army we had. In the early days of deployment the Leopard C2 ( aka Leopard 1A5CAN) proved to be invaluable for supporting infantry moreso than the LAV's. In light of this the Forces recommended that DOD stop pursuing the Stryker and instead explore their options for a new MBT. DOD decided on Leopard 2's. Since we couldn't wait on a shipment of new Leopards we just borrowed/bought surplus tanks from the Dutch.   LAV's against proper AT weopons   To be fair they're not meant to be in those kind of situations. Obviously ambushes happen but still. They're like an APC/IFV hybrid, they get infantry where they need to be and support from a short to mid distance away. They're designed to protect themselves against small arms fire and not much else.    F-35   Well there's a whole can of worms. IMO the F-35 will be the most capable and versatile strike fighter in the world but from a procurement pov it sucks,  well at least for Canada. Harper has lied and misrepresented the price and any concerns regarding the program. We're only getting approx 40 planes, we might get even less. The F-35 might not be what the RCAF is looking for in a strike fighter and they're not getting what they asked in regards to the specific refuelling probe they wanted. I get DOD really wants this plane but at least be upfront about it and make sure it caters to RCAF's needs.  And while we're railing on our procurement strategy in recent years let's talk about the Cyclone. This mother fuckin helicopter was supposed to be in service a couple years ago and we haven't received a single one that is mission ready. The thing that makes it worse is that  DOD keeps calling it an off the shelf product when it asked for a helicopter they just had designed.   And the motherfucking artic patrol boats. Sure they're capable but why, when you're acquiring a slightly modified version of a Norwegian vessel, does it cost more than it did for the Norwegians. And when I say more I mean close to triple.

WarshipPorn,3e1v7a,reviverevival,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think we have a structural problem with our naval procurement. We need to have a sustainable 30/35 year old cycle so we can keep our yards in continuously in business. The way we have it now is we build ships for 20 years, then we lay off all the yard workers and shutter the facilities which, requires massive reinvestment every time we suddenly realize uh-oh, our ships are reaching the end of their lives. As for the F-35, my opinion is that it will one day be a very capable jet. But its strengths are tailored for day 1 strike, and I don't think that is something that fits Canada's mission profile. I'd rather get some passable F-18E/Fs and put the savings towards P-8s or something, but that's not a ""sexy"" thing to sell."

Agree, but not only old but concept is dated IMHO. Fleet composition doesn't make sense -- IMHO we should more arctic and support, less blue water patrol   because I see DOD's reasoning behind doing it the way they did   Sure, understand how they have had to react, but always reacting b/c never prepared...   To be fair they're not meant to be in those kind of situations   Sure, but they're glorified armored trucks... decent for peace keeping, but we lack any IFV capability to fight in a modern threat environment   IMO the F-35 will be the most capable and versatile strike fighter in the world    Clearly the commonality approach for the F35 meant that it was designed as a STOVL and then re-engineered for a land-based and carrier-based aircraft... inherently compromised design.  What air superiority fighter is single-engined?  I don't know enough to weigh the cost-benefit analysis of the F35A versus european/hornet alternatives, but inherently every buyer of the F35 is subsidizing the Marines' (and brits i guess) desire for STOVL... particularly when the arctic is figured-in, the reliability and range compromise shouldn't be ignored.  The fact that we're down to buying 40 aircraft is ridiculous... that in itself is a failure.   And while we're railing on our procurement strategy in recent years let's talk about the Cyclone   I...

[26 Dec 00] I stumbled across your forum last week, and if I can be any help let me know. I am the son of the current owner of the PLAINVIEW, which is located in Chinook, Washington. The boat is partially scrapped, but only the rear half of the house was removed, along with the exhaust cowlings and some of the deck gear. In my opinion it will never run under its own power again; getting it to that point would be an extreme labor of love. I think this would have been the case when my father purchased it, but even more so now.   My father's original intent for the vessel was salmon processing in the Bristol Bay Alaska fishery, but due to falling salmon prices that never happened. It was indeed in the movie ""Short Circuit"" as I saw mentioned in the forum. It was moored in Astoria, Oregon for many years until my father sold his boatbuilding shop there. It was then moved to its current location 2.4 miles East of the Astoria Bridge on the Washington side of the river. The scrapping project was begun in 1996 and lasted about two months. It was halted due to a drop in aluminum prices and has never been resumed.   I am not sure of my father's plans on this matter, he is busy with a new business venture for a new rudder design, so I believe it is on semi-permanent hold. Feel free to check out the website regarding his business ""Deflector Marine Rudder"" at www.deflectorrudder.com. He does not wish to be contacted regarding the PLAINVIEW however, so please address comments to me.  Now it sits, serving mainly as a tourist attraction. We can't seem to keep the ""No Trespassing"" signs up, and I personally had to chase many people off of it when I lived at home. In my opinion, if someone was really interested in making it useful again as a hydrofoil, it could be used as an educational exhibit vessel. It would not be too difficult to make it appear to be in running condition... much easier than actually making it ever run again. It definitely has drawing power, but I don't know if even that is enough.   I hope this answers questions you might have had.

It appears that the destroyers are opening for public visits while at dock.  The Murasame-class (1994) destroyers are the third generation destroyers of the JMSDF, introduced in order to gradually phase out the aging Asagiri-class destroyers from the 1980s. The class is the first to introduce stealth capability to the JMSDF with a low RADAR cross section design, and it is complemented with a significantly improved C4I system as well as other electronics. Armaments are also improved from its predecessor, with a new 16-cell Mk 41 VLS for ASROC installed on the front deck and a 8-cell Mk 48 VLS for SSM  & ESSM installed amidship between the smokestacks."

I wasn't up for creating an album about submarine design, because those always take forever, so I thought adding new photos and updating descriptions would be fairly easy.  I thought it would only take me an hour or so, but I ended up adding 71 new photos and completely re-writing it.  So much for a quick project, but it was fun looking at all these photos together.  As always, I'll link to this playlist for a soundtrack to go along with viewing the album.  Also, RES does not preserve formatting in imgur, so there are some cases where I have two paragraphs in the imgur album that get smooshed into one giant paragraph on RES."

Out of curiousity though, where would you say Russian submarine technology is heading in the future (were we to ignore the major economic hurdles)?"
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,ArturTanreall,4,Mon Jul 20 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say where they are going because the design bureaus don't put out a great deal about their future plans.  Some diagrams are available, but they're not particularly detailed.  I would say that you should expect continued innovation in hydrodynamics and unorthodox shapes (pretty vague, I know)."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,ArturTanreall,2,Mon Jul 20 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting nonetheless! I remember you posting somewhere before about Russia's way of finding subs via satellite (can't remember if it was via magnetic or hydrodynamic disturbances). Think that'll come into the designs as well, or would that take a back seat given the USN's reticence (at least as far as I've seen so far) towards the concept?"
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,irishjihad,3,Mon Jul 20 19:34:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they'll keep developing it further.  I think the US is perhaps beginning to wake up to the idea.  I read an article about how the head of nuclear propulsion keeps a model of the Severodvinsk on his desk, which is a good sign."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,2skicomrade,9,Mon Jul 20 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"/u/Vepr157, I think you're understating your own ability to do research, summarize and create informative pieces of documentation.  This is a very well researched and put together  history of a very technical but utterly relevant issue. People in most naval engineering classes would love to read about this.    I think you should consider monetizing your work through ad revenue. You have a dedicated following in /r/WarshipPorn and I am sure the potential to do so in many other places, reddit or otherwise.   If imgur can do it, so can you."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,ripperljohn,14,Mon Jul 20 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you saying that.  I am being monetarily compensated by editing a book or two of a naval historian, and I got paid for my Proceedings article, but I would feel uneasy somehow monetizing this stuff.  When I was younger, I would have loved to know all the information I know now, and I'm not sure I really would want to pay for it unless it was in a book.  So basically all of this stuff might get turned into a book one day (will have to ask my naval historian friend how feasible this is), but until then I don't really have any plans to monetize in some way."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,DingleberryDouchebag,4,Mon Jul 20 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"Very well documented album! Shouldn't the borei have the same emergency thruster as a 971 since it uses most of his propulsion line?  On the alrosa, why is the pumpjet so long? It probably has a stator before the rotor to allow for the shaft of the rudder and aft diving plane?"
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,Carjunkie599,5,Mon Jul 20 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"The Boreis do have the same thrusters as the Boreis and probably the Yasens, but I only have that single photo of the Akula's.  Alrosa's pumpjet has two rotors, which is probably why it's so large."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,ZenMasterFlash,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see the logic of having two rotors in a pumpjet, isn't it asking for mechanical trouble? On the picture describing the two sets of rotor, I see the rotor behind the stator and two screws on the right that would not fit inside a pumpjet."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,Witacha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, they do look different than the one in the previous photo.  The object behind the stator is a hub of some sort and doesn't have any blades.  However, those two propellers seem more like ship screws, probably from other ships near Alrosa."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,oversizedhat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:38 2015 UTC,"Those propellers are definitely not for that pumpjet.  Pumpjet rotors are more like what you see in the previous photo.  I'm surprised they are not more curved like a turbine blade, but I guess their job is a bit different as they are more for propelling water at a higher speed versus the compression (water being MOSTLY incompressible) forces in a turbine made for gases."

WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,cumminslover007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"The angle definitely contributes to the wonky-looking blades.  It is possible that the screws are damaged, but to my eye they look too consistent.  The blade design is very complex, so I don't know exactly why they would be shaped like that."
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,veller666,2,Tue Jul 21 00:37:25 2015 UTC,I think I see one blade that is bent more sharply than the others (look on the tips of the left screw). This leads me to think those screws were damaged
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,SevenandForty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely possible, but it's very hard to tell the true curvature of a screw just by looking at it because the appearance changes so drastically with angle."

Is the technology that different among soviet/american/british engineering teams that they really needed to worry about a propeller design being stolen, or is it just over-paranoia?"
WarshipPorn,3dy7jb,JimDandy_ToTheRescue,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"For a long time, the Soviets probably didn't know about the advanced screws the US Navy was making in the 1960s, so they did want to keep it secret.  There was a lot of exchange between the British and the US in terms of propulsor design (the Brits told us how to build pumpjets and we probably told them how to build skewback screws)."

That is, tumblehome is where the waterline crossection is wider than that of the main deck.   X-bows, on the other hand, do not have such a feature. This, for example, shows you how the waterline area is narrower than the main deck, as would be the case in conventional hulls. The feature is in how the waterline and main deck are ""connected""."

The Turks ceased fire when he signaled his surrender and so his crew was able to destroy documents and equipment before opening the seacocks to sink the submarine.

WarshipPorn,3dvf2r,dziban303,19,Sun Jul 19 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, one of those 16 inch turrets with all the machinery weighed more than a destroyer? That is insane."
WarshipPorn,3dvf2r,kjg1228,5,Sun Jul 19 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"Close, but I don't think they're quite there.  Per wiki the turrets are around 267,000 lbs, while WW2 destroyers seem to all be around 2000+ tons, or 400,000 lbs +  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16%22/50_caliber_Mark_7_gun https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:World_War_II_destroyers_of_the_United_States"
WarshipPorn,3dvf2r,gnartung,6,Mon Jul 20 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"The description in the photo says ""machinery"". I'm not really sure if that's exclusively the rifles and the turret or the entire firing operation and if it is fully loaded it wouldn't surprise me if it was 2,000 tons.   Again, I'm just speculating. I have no idea about this kind of stuff.  Edit: a word"
WarshipPorn,3dvf2r,kjg1228,4,Mon Jul 20 01:09:38 2015 UTC,"It really just depends on the class of destroyer.  A leftover from WWI, like the USS Chew, the gun weighed more.  A mid 30s build, like the USS Hull, probably very similar.  A later class, like the USS Gearing, new during WWII would have weighed more than the gun.  Either way the main batteries were heavy as shit."
WarshipPorn,3dvf2r,rhit06,3,Mon Jul 20 01:14:28 2015 UTC,"I prefer Navweaps as a source for naval guns.   Each turret weighed between 1,701-1,708 tons.  A Gleaves class DD weighed 1,630 tons (wiki)."

As I was staring at this photo in the magazine, I could swear there were seven tugs (one next to the farthest tug) and not six as the caption said , and I almost went with a Seven Dwarfs joke in the title. But I realized that I'd been looking at the photo for about half an hour straight and was starting to see things that weren't there, so I trusted the caption after all.  This reminds me, I should post this to /r/tuglife"
WarshipPorn,3dx12p,Hemispherical,2,Mon Jul 20 06:13:13 2015 UTC,I always wondered: is there any specific reason for violentry throwing a ship into the ocean instead of letting it slide in slowly?
WarshipPorn,3dx12p,Komb_at,4,Mon Jul 20 08:47:18 2015 UTC,Sliding in bow first has damaged ships in the past. This way the force is distributed over a wider area.   Or at least that's what I've read.
WarshipPorn,3dx12p,Counterflak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:53:52 2015 UTC,Probably just the way the shipyard is organized and the relatively small size of the freedom class
WarshipPorn,3dx12p,JRoch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:41 2015 UTC,"The side launch is fairly standard at river shipyards and for smaller ships. The issue with the stern launch is that the ship gathers a lot of momentum, and you have to stop it somehow; usually that means slowing it down over time with tugs or dropping anchors immediately, etc. With the side launch, it slides in, rocks a few times, and settles down (the length of the hull under water isn't designed to travel horizontally, so it stops quicker than the pointed stern will).   As far as ""violently,"" a moderate storm at sea is going to be much more violent than this."

WarshipPorn,3duzs1,zoutesnaak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:05:29 2015 UTC,So its attached to a wire all the time? I'd imagine this greatly decreases its range. Is this because you only use torpedoes on visible targets anyway?
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,rhyswilliams999,21,Sun Jul 19 19:55:05 2015 UTC,"considering the TOW 2 missle system is wire guided and has a range of 4.5km, the range on the larger/heavier F21 will be longer. It would be able to support a very long cable. Fire optic wire cannot be jammed or intercepted, unlike radio or laser guidance, also water would hinder other means of guidance."
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,zoutesnaak,4,Sun Jul 19 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"Ah oké cool, thanks!"
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,just_an_ordinary_guy,4,Sun Jul 19 21:49:03 2015 UTC,"I can't remember exactly how long the guidance wire is on the Mk 48 ADCAP, and it's range (and probably the length of guidance wire it carries) is classified, but suffice to say that it is a number of miles of relatively thin wire.  I would suspect that this will be the case of the F21.  Now, the Mk48 ADCAP is an internal combustion engine and not electric, so I don't know how this affects range.  I would be willing to bet that the amount of guidance wire is pretty close to the range of the torpedo.  Also, I would be willing to bet that it can go well over the horizon."
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,Xorondras,10,Mon Jul 20 05:37:30 2015 UTC,Most if not all torpedoes are wire guided.
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,large_butt,4,Sun Jul 19 22:17:18 2015 UTC,"While true, it's also unnecessary (albeit useful) to guide them all the way to their target. They can go active and hunt on their own."
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,Xorondras,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:28 2015 UTC,I guess the boats sensors are less prone to countermeasures than the torpedoe's
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,yer_momma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:11:58 2015 UTC,Once they go active on their own doesn't your own sub and other friendlys become potential targets?
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,snusmumrikan,2,Mon Jul 20 07:32:15 2015 UTC,"Well they get sent quite a distance before they become active and are hopefully pointing in the direction of the enemy, and not the sub that fired the torpedo."
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,SlapchopRock,5,Mon Jul 20 09:56:12 2015 UTC,"Crazy, I had no idea.  I guess there's no good way to make a countermeasure that consistently cuts that wire at enough range (I assume there is a backup system anyways)  Edit: ah, duh.  They don't know its coming in time to do that kind of thing effectively anyways."
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,gijose41,11,Sun Jul 19 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"As countermeasures, the Russians have developed super-cavitating rocket torpedo that can cut the wire of a torpedo.   However, the torpedoes can also operate off of a active/passive sonar."
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,Corsair438_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:00 2015 UTC,What happens to the wire post boom?
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,jschooltiger,5,Mon Jul 20 02:21:51 2015 UTC,It sinks.
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,just_an_ordinary_guy,4,Mon Jul 20 02:43:34 2015 UTC,The torpedo tube door will cut the wire as it shuts and the stuff outside of the ship will sink.
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,TheRighteousTyrant,7,Mon Jul 20 05:38:39 2015 UTC,Is this because you only use torpedoes on visible targets anyway?   Not since WW2 has this been true.
WarshipPorn,3duzs1,Brentg7,3,Sun Jul 19 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"Its used to maneuver the torpedo close to the enemy before activating, so the torpedo's own tracking devices(sonar,ect..) can  finish the job. It helps hide where the sub launching it is also, by letting the torpedo's momentum from being launched move it away from the attacking sub, before  firing up the screws."

WarshipPorn,3duuju,gentlemangin,2,Mon Jul 20 07:24:54 2015 UTC,"Seems like they're about double the displacement of the current French SSNs, and nearly 20 meters longer and a meter or so wider.  EDIT:  It seems like in this added displacement, it will be able to carry 6 more torpedos and/or missiles and carry commandos.  Not sure what else.  It talks about being able to stay at sea for 70 days vs 45 days, but the crew compliment is slightly smaller, so it seems that is a bigger factor than added dry and cold storage."
WarshipPorn,3du2oe,Kytescall,5,Sun Jul 19 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"Photographer's page  One of several ROVs used by the JMSDF minesweeper fleet. This particular one is equipped with an imaging sonar and a low light television camera. It has detachable cutters for severing the mooring lines of mooring mines (the cutters are attached to the line, then the ROV retreats to a safe distance before remotely cutting it), and an explosive for detonating bottom mines (pictured here between the skids, although it is almost certainly a training bomb).  There are two variants, the S-7•1 which is carried by the Uwagima-class minesweeper, and the S-7•2, which is carried by the Yaeyama-class. The only difference that I know of is that the '•2' has the cutters but the older '•1' variant doesn't."

WarshipPorn,3dt70o,Hemispherical,3,Sun Jul 19 05:33:43 2015 UTC,"Sacramento is considered a benchmark in West Coast shipbuilding. The ship and two of her sister ships, Seattle (AOE-3) and Detroit (AOE-4), are the largest ships ever built on the West Coast as of 2005. Only Iowa-class battleships and aircraft carriers have greater displacements than Sacramento.  The ship's main engines came from the never-completed battleship Kentucky (BB-66), and delivered in excess of 100,000 shaft horsepower (75 MW) to two 23-foot (7 m) screws weighing 19.25 tons each, the largest on any ship in the Navy.  Sacramento was the fastest AOE (fast combat support ship) ever. The Sacramento routinely went head-to-head in speed runs and won against the west coast's AOE's, including the Camden (AOE-2) and the Rainier (AOE-7). Sacramento also beat the fastest of the east coast AOE's, including the Detroit (AOE-4) and the Arctic (AOE-8) in head-to-head competition.

In Europe, the Western Front is massively hyped, but that only lasted for a little under a year, and Germany was already going to lose anyway. Make no mistake, between the Western Front, the North African campaign, island-hopping in the Pacific, and the Japanese invasion of China and SE Asia(massively under-hyped IMO), the real war was between the Nazis and Bolsheviks. Just look at this map: http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/ww2-loss.htm As a more serious note, I'm not underplaying the role of America in WWII. Tbh, America's biggest contribution was the Lend-Lease Act(and cash-and-carry before that) and without it, the early years of WWII could have played out much different. But just know that WWII was an ideological clash of two different kinds of nationalism. Not religion, not freedom, but nationalism."

That banner in the sky; Beneath it rung the battle shout, And burst the cannon's roar;-- The meteor of the ocean air Shall sweep the clouds no more.    Her deck, once red with heroes' blood, Where knelt the vanquished foe, When winds were hurrying o'er the flood, And waves were white below, No more shall feel the victor's tread, Or know the conquered knee;-- The harpies of the shore shall pluck The eagle of the sea!    Oh, better that her shattered hulk Should sink beneath the wave; Her thunders shook the mighty deep, And there should be her grave; Nail to the mast her holy flag, Set every threadbare sail, And give her to the god of storms, The lightning and the gale!'"

In the 70's and 80's the Navy started taking restoring Constitution seriously and made an effort to identify sources of the same oak used during her construction and harvest/cure it for future use.  Funny thing is  they say the only original pieces left from her original construction are in the keel.  So yes, they have the right wood to fix her correctly now, soo much in fact that we have started sending some to the British to help with Victory as she is in really poor shape compared to Constitution."

WarshipPorn,3dmpa9,2skicomrade,6,Fri Jul 17 15:02:00 2015 UTC,They do and they were (allegedly) used a lot against Sweden during the cold war and possibly in the confirmed violation around Stockholm last year.
WarshipPorn,3dmpa9,Zpiritual,7,Fri Jul 17 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"They couldn't have been used last year, because both submarines of this type were decommissioned and scrapped in the 1990s... makes me wonder what type of sub the Russian allegedly used, as the only two kilos of the Baltic fleet were both in harbor/undergoing repair work at the time."
WarshipPorn,3dmpa9,2skicomrade,6,Fri Jul 17 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the type of submarine in a more general sense than this class specifically.   It couldn't have been a kilo anyway, a kilo is way to big to be able to hide that far inside the archipelago. It was some offspring to this class, possibly even smaller still. I remember there was some research into what class it could've been in the media last year and this type of sub is apparently highly classified and not much is known about them, how many there are still in service etc."
WarshipPorn,3dmpa9,Zpiritual,2,Fri Jul 17 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"Must be something pretty secret, because there are no conventional mini-subs similar to these left in Russian service.  Maybe one of the mini-nuke boats from the Northern Fleet made the trip?  The only other possibility that comes to mind are their several types of rescue submarines.  But all of theses have specific surface ships to carry them, and none of those were in the Baltic at the time"
WarshipPorn,3dmpa9,2skicomrade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"Speaking of ships to carry them, there was a Russian owned oil tanker standing virtually still for several days on international water just outside Stockholm.

One of the reasons that the Piranhas were retired was that the Russian Navy didn't think they were necessary (besides a lack of funding, being too big and difficult to use).    Just to throw out another (probably unlikely) idea, but Poland has three very small Kobben class submarines in service."

WarshipPorn,3dmdjs,nomoredarkness,14,Fri Jul 17 14:41:16 2015 UTC,i think the technical term for that many carriers is a shit load.
WarshipPorn,3dmdjs,DirkMcDougal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:52:30 2015 UTC,Agreed.
WarshipPorn,3dmdjs,DirkMcDougal,8,Sat Jul 18 00:17:42 2015 UTC,Near as I can tell there were 13 Essex that were actually completed and engaged in combat before the end of the war. Add to that Saratoga and Enterprise and by the end of the war the USN had 15 large fleet carriers operating in the Pacific.  So 21 Allied CV's. I CBA to count all the light and escort carriers.
WarshipPorn,3dmdjs,cv5cv6,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:58 2015 UTC,Probably not all operational at the same time though: Franklin was put out of the war in March 1945 and Enterprise was badly damaged in May 1945.
WarshipPorn,3dmdjs,ewanc9,2,Fri Jul 17 22:08:57 2015 UTC,True enough. Just trying to answer his question.

WarshipPorn,3dm1ke,sverdrupian,2,Fri Jul 17 10:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why the RNs 2 Echo-class survey ships are not considered survey vessels. The RN states ""HMS Scott is the Royal Navy’s only ocean survey vessel."" here"
WarshipPorn,3dm1ke,savannah_dude,5,Fri Jul 17 12:11:49 2015 UTC,I would guess it is just due to the sonar capabilities. Scott has a large sonar (hence why it is so much bigger than the echo class) and can map 150 square kilometres of ocean per hour. The smaller sonars of the echo class probably makes them less practical for surveying large areas and deep water.
WarshipPorn,3dm1ke,breakneckterror,2,Fri Jul 17 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"That's a really good question and I don't know the answer (which means I probably shouldn't of added that factoid to the title since I can't explain). Perhaps it would make sense if they referred to it a the only ocean-class vessel because as you point out the Echo-class ships also function as survey vessels.  For civilian research vessels the US has started demarcating ships as global-class, ocean-class, region-class, and coastal-class."
WarshipPorn,3dm1ke,Hopper1010,2,Fri Jul 17 12:27:09 2015 UTC,Looks good! What exactly does it survey?
WarshipPorn,3dm1ke,hugged_at_gunpoint,3,Fri Jul 17 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"Traditionally survey vessels mapped out water depths, coastlines, harbors, anchorages, etc...  In modern times their activities have expanded to include measurement of the properties of the water column itself (temperature, salinity, turbidity) - the detailed properties of the ocean realm which are crucial for submarine warfare.  I would guess that surveying the magnetic properties of the seafloor might also be handy if you operate a fleet of submarines."

WarshipPorn,3djo2x,WarLorax,6,Thu Jul 16 22:50:55 2015 UTC,Theoretically. So many of the shots we see have most of their hornets on the bow and they're probably all chained down so how long do you suppose it would take to get them shuffled off to clear at least one catapult?
WarshipPorn,3djo2x,JRoch,10,Fri Jul 17 04:22:35 2015 UTC,"It had 4 catapults, so I am sure they would use the one farthest from the island for a clear takeoff and could move the aircraft around afterwards before time for landing."
WarshipPorn,3djo2x,Hemispherical,5,Thu Jul 16 21:49:34 2015 UTC,They could have used cats three and four while moving them off the stern so they could land later

WarshipPorn,3djo2x,Ravage123,20,Thu Jul 16 23:50:26 2015 UTC,"In case you're curious as to why: they both shared the same radars - the first operational phased-array radars that was the predecessor of the SPY-1 used in AEGIS ships later. Called SCANFAR, they consisted of two separate antenna, the AN/SPS-32 and -33, the rectangle and square, respectively. They were used for surveillance of the airspace and tracking the targets. The original plan was to have only one antenna do both of those, in addition to being the guidance radar for anti-ship missiles: however, this was much too ambitious for the early 1960s."

WarshipPorn,3dk94z,Timmyc62,11,Fri Jul 17 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"Just in case they want to put STOVL aircraft on board, like the F-35B. However, the Navy recently revealed that it's highly unlikely going to go forth with that option, as it would cost to much to add all the additional repair and handling facilities to the ships in order to accommodate the jets.  Also worth noting that these ships are based on the same design as the Spanish Juan Carlos I, which is equipped to operate Harrier STOVL aircraft."
WarshipPorn,3dk94z,SamTheGeek,2,Fri Jul 17 00:58:43 2015 UTC,ETA until they cross-deck some F-35Bs?   I think the answer depends more on how aggressively the PLA-N begins to push its carrier(s) into blue water.

WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,teemoore,13,Thu Jul 16 14:33:24 2015 UTC,I am always surprised how close to the shores of belligerent nations in WWII that submarines would strike. Knowing that US ships were sunk not far off of the US coast by German U-boats was a big surprise to me when I learned it. I imagine the Japanese would feel the same way about this kind of thing.
WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,CupBeEmpty,14,Thu Jul 16 16:44:12 2015 UTC,Probably a big surprise for the skipper of the Nautilus as well considering how shitty the torps were in the early part of the war.
WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,Porkgazam,10,Thu Jul 16 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am curious why they were so bad? I honestly know nothing about it other than what I learned from Attack Sub 688."
WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,CupBeEmpty,14,Thu Jul 16 17:23:09 2015 UTC,The torps the USN used were Mark 14s. They usually ran deeper than what they were set at. This is because when they were tested they had water in place of an explosive warhead. Explosives are denser and heavier so when it was fired as a warshot the torp would run deeper than calibrated usually going under the keel of a Japanese ship.  The magnetic detonator would prematurely fire. This is because the earth has different magnetic fields. The magnetic field where the torp detonators were tested is different than where the war was occurring.  The torps instead of running hot straight and normal just run in circles which caused at least one or two subs to sink themselves.
WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,Porkgazam,8,Thu Jul 16 17:43:19 2015 UTC,at least one or two subs to sink themselves.   I had no idea.  I wonder what the problem was with the magnetic field. Was it a problem with declination or just variances in the strength of the magnetic field?
WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,CupBeEmpty,5,Thu Jul 16 17:53:01 2015 UTC,Variances in the strength of the magnetic field in different areas of the Pacific.

WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,Abu_Abdullah,9,Thu Jul 16 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"The well-documented failures section is great:   On 24 December 1941, Commander Tyrell D. Jacobs in Sargo fired a total of eight torpedoes at two different ships, with no results, and had become very frustrated; when two additional merchantmen came in view, he took extra pains to get it right, pursuing for fifty-seven minutes[24] and making certain TDC bearings matched perfectly before firing two torpedoes at each ship, at an average of 1,000 yd (910 m), very close range. All missed.[25] A few days after he discovered the torpedoes were running too deep, and corrected the problem,[26] Jacobs detected a big, slow tanker. Again, his approach was meticulous, firing one torpedo at a close 1,200 yd (1,100 m). It missed. Exasperated, Jacobs broke radio silence, openly questioning the Mark 14's reliability.[27]"

I understand that larger and slower ships like cargo ships and stationary ships were the typical targets for subs to sink but for a sub to torpedo a fast moving destroyer is kind of difficult to comprehend. How could the sub catch a destroyer and then conveniently position itself to fire torpedoes at it?
WarshipPorn,3dhxqy,Mrprocrastinaut,7,Thu Jul 16 18:21:34 2015 UTC,"Lay in wait, get in close, fire a spread, and ships are pretty big targets. It'll be harder to hit a destroyer than a slower, larger merchant ship, but it's hardly impossible."

In 1921, the Royal Navy scrapped dozens of its capital ships. Everything made between 1907-1910, making the Royal Navy very weak. To combat this designs were drawn up for new capital ships (battleships and battlecruisers). These being the Nelson and G3 designs with plans to build four at a time.  This massive increase in firepower (these ships would've outmatched anything on the high seas) pissed of the Americans and Japanese something rotten. So they called a meeting with the idea to disarm and prevent a ""future war programme"". On the 12th Nov 1921, delegated from; Great Britain, American, Japan, France and Italy were invited.  At the meeting Britain conceeded more than any other nation and a treaty was signed limiting ship tonnage (total) , replacement tonnage and maximum ship tonnage. Great Britain was allowed 22 ships (580,450 tons), America 18 ships (500,650 tons), Japan had 10 ships (301,320 tons). The maximum replacement was 525,000 for the US and Great Britain, and 350,000 tons for Japan. Italy had 10 ships (182,800 tons) and France also had 10 ships (221,700 tons). All other capital ships were to be scrapped, sold or decomissioned. Each nation was permitted to lay down new tonnage in 1927,1929 and 1931.  Each nation was also allowed a replacement tonnage of 175,000 with no single ships being allowed to exceed 35,000 tons, or armed with greater than 16"" guns, or exceed 20 years of age. Great Britain was allowed to finish Nelson and Rodney as Colorado, Maryland, West Virginia, Nagato and Mutsu were under construction with 16"" guns.  The treaty was signed on 6th February 1922. Thus ended Great Britain's naval supremacy.  edit: Spelling"

The designs were actually the N3 (Battleships, 18"" guns) and G3 (Battlecruiser, 16"" guns).  The Nelson design didn't come about until after the treaty, which limited the tonnage to 35,000. As the G3 design was a 48,000ton design they were clearly over the limit. So the design was modified into the Nelsons. The Nelsons were nick-named 'cherry tree ships' because their design from the G3s had been 'cut down' by the treaty."

Guess a carrier doesn't move far in 15-20min, but still a good 10-15km.  And presumably the jam would be from aircraft, not the carrier or ships themselves."

If the high trajectory missile is shot down, another will rise to take its place.   And not necessarily, the chances of a prowler being in the air at any given time are slim.

Hard for me to see how the Admiral Kuznetsov could launch missiles at a US carrier group without being noticed (if it could survive long enough to get in range at all)... during the missiles' 15-20min flight time, I'm sure they'd have no problem getting a Growler or two in the air.  If the ship-based jamming is hurting, not helping, my guess is they have the carrier go dark."

It stems from glorious 90s when Russia was the country was in complete shambles, military funding was non-existant and the huge used-to-be-soviet navy was the quickest deteriorating military branch.  Right now Navy can't just pull out the carrier for a complete refit and modernization for multiple of reasons. Lack of shipyards\equipment is one of them as Severodvinsk is preoccupied with Nakhimov. Then there are Leader-class destroyers which production is announced to start around 2019, which is about the time Nakhimov should be commissioned so I see no time frame in which Kuznetsov can be brought to a more adequate state.  Imho, it is considered more as a ship that allows to preserve cadres and knowledge on how to operate vehicles of such class than anything else. Although the current airwing may perform CAP it most likely won't be used in any expeditionary operations any time soon."

WarshipPorn,3deh40,meanwhileinjapan,6,Wed Jul 15 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"No, she and Scharnhorst had clipper bows which were almost straight up and down when viewed from the side.  They got swamped easily so they were given bows that angled forward much more rakishly in an attempt to help.  It didn't however and they had very wet decks."

WarshipPorn,3deh40,sleeves1991,2,Thu Jul 16 09:59:45 2015 UTC,IIRC Gneisenau did take some damage at sea and her forwardmost turret almost never functioned at 100% due to her low freeboard.
WarshipPorn,3deh40,rtwpsom2,2,Thu Jul 16 13:23:31 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they were battle cruisers. Important given the size of their guns which was smaller.
WarshipPorn,3deh40,manualLurking,6,Wed Jul 15 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"According to the Washington Treaty she was a battleship.  The title she was given by the Germans was Schlachtshif, which was the same as the Bismark class."
WarshipPorn,3deh40,rtwpsom2,7,Wed Jul 15 23:30:35 2015 UTC,'Battlecruiser' generally refers to a capital warship that sacrifices armour for firepower and speed.  Originally intended for chasing and killing enemy cruisers.  Please reexamine your understanding of the term 'Battlecruiser'
WarshipPorn,3deh40,savannah_dude,3,Thu Jul 16 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the Germans did intend these ships to be Battlecruisers or at least function in that capacity, like chasing down cruisers or merchant ships. The reason that the ships only had 11 inch guns is  the they were limited to that caliber by treaty and a change in philosophy by the Germans in that 11 inch guns were sufficient to take on British cruisers. The pocket “Battleship” was constructed along the same lines, anything fast enough to keep up could be out gunned and anything that could out gun them could not keep up. Yet no one really thought of  these ships as battleships at the time of their operation."
WarshipPorn,3deh40,bsurfn2day,0,Fri Jul 17 18:28:08 2015 UTC,"If how they were intend to be used matters in classification, the Bismarck-class were to act a commerce raiders.  Were they battlecruisers too? I'd say that the Deutschland-class 'pocket battleships' were slow heavy cruisers that could be run down and clubbed like a baby seal by a battlecruiser such as the Renown-class or Hood.  The Dunkerque-class was also a bit faster."
WarshipPorn,3deh40,savannah_dude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"No Idea why you're being downvoted, you are correct, battlecruisers were essentially cruisers with battleship guns. They were faster than battleships but had much less armour."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,spike,2,Wed Jul 15 19:36:33 2015 UTC,"I always wondered what, if any impact this vessel would have had on the War...."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,billus580,7,Wed Jul 15 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"Not much. The Kriegsmarine did not have a comprehensive naval vision of how to use carriers, the way the Japanese and Americans did. This carrier was essentially a stand-alone craft intended for reconnaissance and/or commerce raiding, with heavy guns to engage enemy surface ships. There was no conception of a ""carrier task force"" with a protective screen, and in any case, by the time the war started, the Germans did not have the naval resources to deploy one. In addition, the Luftwaffe was not keen on helping the Kriegsmarine with aircraft suitable for carrier warfare, and there was no experienced base of carrier pilots to draw on. By the time the High Command realized how carrier warfare would play out (the Japanese experience in the Pacific in 1941~42) it was much too late to change plans or even build up a fleet of carriers. The original target of Plan Z was for 4 carriers by 1948. Two were started, and only one (the Graf Zeppelin) was even partially finished."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,billus580,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"Such a shame this carrier wasn't completed, even to see how a desperate Germany would have used it in the last months of the war..."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,beachedwhale1945,0,Wed Jul 15 20:58:50 2015 UTC,"Can't use a carrier without airplanes, and in the last months of the war there were no airplanes left to spare, let alone any carrier-ready planes."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,beachedwhale1945,9,Wed Jul 15 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"Germany had plenty of aircraft at wars end. In 1944 they produced 39,800 aircraft, more than any other nation except the United States (96,318). In the first 4 months of 1945, they built ~8,000 aircraft despite the Allies dropping 380,113 tonnes of bombs. What they lacked were trained pilots and especially fuel. Without fuel the aircraft were regularly captured without having ever seeing combat."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,NightMgr,4,Wed Jul 15 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"But they had no aircraft suitable for carriers. Folding wings, arrestor gear, etc.. Plus training for carrier pilots is even more difficult than regular pilots."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,beachedwhale1945,5,Thu Jul 16 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"12xFi 167A-1s, <48xBf 109T-1s, and some Ju 87C-1s were completed, all carrier capable. Further aircraft were cancelled with the carrier, including Ju 87Es and Me 155s. Had the Germans continued work on the carrier they would have had aircraft for it. Their usefulness, however, is debatable, as the Ju 87 was a flying target without fighter support, and the Bf 109 was barely capable against modern aircraft."
WarshipPorn,3df1v6,davratta,2,Thu Jul 16 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"I would also think the narrow wheelbase on the Bf 109 would also make those landings quite difficult.  As I understood it, it was hard enough on a tarmac."
WarshipPorn,3deld8,BrownBoyBrownies,6,Wed Jul 15 17:43:58 2015 UTC,Have we ever seen the Kongo class next to an Arleigh Burke class destroyer?
WarshipPorn,3deld8,Blue387,8,Wed Jul 15 21:43:03 2015 UTC,"Well, here's an Atago-class next to an Arleigh Burke-class.  The Burke is more squat; the Kongo and Atago are taller because they have an extra deck or two for a CIC, since they are supposed to act as flagships.  The mast is very different, the Atago having a much narrower one. The Kongo's mast is different, a non-stealthy lattice mast, but just as narrow.  The location and type of various radars and antennas are pretty different, such as the ECM antennas (on top of the main superstructure, directly above the bridge wings in the Atago, vs directly to the side of the SPY-1 radars in the Burke)."
WarshipPorn,3deld8,Kytescall,2,Thu Jul 16 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"Do you know why the Burkes aren't taller, or if the Atagos and Kongos are stable in high sea states? I know that some Japanese destroyers have different mast designs to enable them to function in northern seas. However, putting a radar higher like that increases your radar horizon, so I would expect that any ship would put the radar as high as practical. This would indicate that the Kongos and Atagos might be less stable than Burkes, as they have a higher CoG and the same hullform. Is there another reason why the radars on the Burkes are not higher up?"
WarshipPorn,3deld8,misunderstandgap,5,Thu Jul 16 05:22:06 2015 UTC,"As I said, the Kongo and Atago classes are taller because they have an extra deck or two, to fulfill a role that the Burkes don't (fleet command). I don't know how stable they are in high seas, but I imagine they're stable enough. The Sea of Japan and the Pacific have some very rough waters. I don't imagine they'd proceed with the design (much less return to it in the Atago-class) if they had serious stability problems."

WarshipPorn,3dddmd,124876720,24,Wed Jul 15 11:43:22 2015 UTC,"The torpedo ram was an interesting turn of the century concept, involving a low-profile vessel with torpedoes and a giant ram, the aim of which was to close with the enemy battle fleet, launch torpedos and them ram some n00bs.  There were some interesting design features - the bridge could split into two rafts if the vessel was disabled, and the keel could be jettisoned to improve bouyancy.      The RN did not, in the end, develop the concept, largely because new quick-firing and quick-traversing defensive armament for battleships had taken Polyphemus's attack profile from ""extremely dangerous"" to ""suicide mission"".    However, Polyphemus's fame did not die with her class.  H.G Wells's seminal War of the Worlds describes the sacrifice of a fictional Royal Navy torpedo ram, with the much better name of HMS Thunder Child, which rams and destroys a Martian walker and thus buying time for civilians to be evacuated.   Spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the torpedo ram, Thunder Child, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping.  [...]  A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the Martian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a great body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the Thunder Child sounded through the reek, going off one after the other, and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer, ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a smack to matchwood.   You can read the rest of her exploits here."

They do the river scene, but no ship comes to the rescue of the refugees.  Imagine if, instead, an old big gun, heavily armored ship (I’m thinking either Wisconsin or Salem as semi-plausible candidates) came barreling down the Hudson, guns blazing.    The shells splash pointlessly off the shields, but she keeps coming.  The walkers fire, taking big chunks out of the old girl.  A turret goes flying off in a massive explosion, but she keeps coming.  Quick cut to the bridge citadel.  Flames are roaring outside the ports.  The walker is barely visible straight ahead through the smoke.  The Captain orders ramming speed and the telegraph clicks, just as another beam from the walkers obliterates the bridge.  The walkers keep firing, but the engines are just buried too deeply and there isn’t enough time.  Nobody is at the helm anymore, but Big Whiskey or Sally Mae knows where to go.  She keeps coming.  Suddenly, she hits the shield.  Plates and frame peel away and crumple.  But there are still tens of thousands of tons of steel behind the ruined bow.  She keeps driving forward until, just as the fire reaches her magazines, she smashes into the legs of the walker.  The machine, immensely fragile once its shield is breached, crumples across the remnants of B turret.  It lays there for just a second and then both ship and Martian are obliterated in a massive explosion.  Now, why on earth was such an awesome scene not in the film?!"

WarshipPorn,3d9lk8,RadomirPutnik,3,Tue Jul 14 22:46:59 2015 UTC,"The nasty yellow is the launch phase. No specific purpose to the color, just the chemical reaction, once is goes into boost it turns white then as it goes into cruise/terminal it will dissipate. SM-2 are solid fuel so it smokes the whole way. Turbofan missiles like Tomahawk or most anti-ship cruise missiles will have a solid propellant booster which will create a lot of smoke. The booster is then jettisoned (usually) and the turbofan (jet engine) takes over and there will be no smoke. Once in cruise phase they are incredibly hard to see visually."

WarshipPorn,3d7lh2,trk2,5,Tue Jul 14 15:42:08 2015 UTC,I paid for below deck tour of the Missouri at Pearl Harbor in December 2001.

WarshipPorn,3d7lh2,beachedwhale1945,3,Tue Jul 14 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"No. The largest naval guns in service top out around 150mm. Most navies have main guns around 127mm, destroyer caliber guns. The Iowas have 9x406mm main guns and 12x127mm guns.   Only 9 battleships currently exist, all as museums. The pre-dreadnought Mikasa is well over 100 years old. Texas just passed her 100th birthday. They have 305 and 356mm guns respectively. All other battleships, Alabama, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin have 9x406mm guns. Iowa and Wisconsin could theoretically be recommissioned in a matter of months, but I cannot imagine a likely scenario where modern ships would not be superior.   The Kirov class is often called battlecruisers, but their main armament is a variety of missiles. One is in service and another under rebuild. The remaining two would take years to activate."

WarshipPorn,3d7gao,autowikibot,2,Tue Jul 14 02:50:00 2015 UTC,"Algerine-class minesweeper:       The Algerine class was a class of minesweepers of the Royal Navy and the Commonwealth. 110 ships of the class were launched between 1942 and 1944 and served in World War II.  They were designed as small vessels that could serve in several roles, not just as minesweepers; in practice the desperate shortage of convoy escorts in the Battle of the Atlantic meant that they served mainly in that role; twelve Algerines of the Royal Canadian Navy consequently never had minesweeping gear fitted.  After the war, a number continued in service as patrol boats, survey ships, and training ships. Some were sold to other navies or into merchant service. At least one - HMS Pickle (commanded by Lt. Cmdr. Hallifax and, later, Lt. Cmdr, Collins) - was still engaged in minesweeping duties in British waters as late as 1955. At least one Algerine is still in service with the Royal Thai Navy: HTMS Phosampton (ex-HMS Minstrel).

WarshipPorn,3d4be2,ExNusquam,2,Mon Jul 13 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"That's probably because there were limited scenarios where the French would engage in nuclear combat on their own.

They've already cut out the reactor compartment, but need to install a model in its place and give the old sub a good refurbishment.  Its not in the best shape.

First, there is no photograph or written record I can find showing independent traverse. One may exist, but I've seen dozens of pictures with all four guns locked together.   Second, there is no evidence of an additional traversing mechanism. On every naval turret I have seen (which is not many, to be fair), the traversing gears are beneath the visible turret in the upper portion of the barbette. This would put the gears inside the larger turret, and for large turrets, you would have substantial gears (the normal twin mounts on the Virginia's weighed 151 tons). This would reduce the room inside the main turret, causing additional problems."

They're just much, much slower and no longer amphibious. It'd be effectively a mobility kill but pretty easy to fix.  Second it's a surprisingly difficult thing to damage. Shockwaves won't do anything. Individual bullet's will leave tiny, bullet sized holes. An anti-ship missile would blow the whole thing apart anyway so who cares."

The type of layered construction of the warheads were generically referred to as Beehive rounds.  The Sanshiki anti-aircraft shell was designed for several gun calibers, including the 46 cm (18.1-inch) guns of the Yamato-class battleships.  The 46 cm (18.1 in) Sanshiki Model 13 round weighed 2,998 lb and was filled with 900 incendiary tubes and 600 steel stays. The round was equipped with a delay fuze set before firing that detonated the shell at the set altitude; on explosion, the steel stays and the incendiary tubes were ejected in a 20-degree cone forward, with the shell fragments from the explosion itself further increasing the amount of debris. The incendiary tubes ignited about a half-second later and burned for five seconds with 16-foot (5 meters) long flames.  Each of the incendiary tubes was a 90 mm long, 25 mm diameter hollow steel cylinder, filled with rubber thermite (phosphorus, vulcanized rubber, natural rubber, stearic acid, sulphur and barium nitrate) and ignited through holes on both sides. The rounds were similar to conventional shells, except for their wood-filled ogive and several layers of assembled fragments.

Second consideration: what is the purpose of your armed forces?   In Peru's case, the most likely enemy will be a regional/neighboring country (Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, etc) or a foreign power. But when thinking about a foreign power (lets say China), it is important to realize the US will step in at that point. We have defense agreements with many South American nations. So now you've established the ideal enemy of your nation, you need to determine the best strategy to counter that nation's armed forces. In South America, there is a lack of sophisticated technology in missile and naval forces. Few countries possess a substantial submarine fleet and few possess a sophisticated missile force. But what they all have is robust ground forces backed up by a solid air force.

WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,savannah_dude,11,Sun Jul 12 13:54:00 2015 UTC,What's the state of this ship now? Is it maintained and used or do they just keep it around in order to have a big ship as flagship?
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,Zpiritual,9,Sun Jul 12 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, is still maintained and crewed as the fleet flagship which in my opinion should have been the fate of the Missouri."
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,BcookieOmonsterB,14,Sun Jul 12 18:02:44 2015 UTC,"But...why the Missouri? the Almirante Grau is the largest and most powerful ship in the Peruvian Navy, whereas an Iowa class BB isn't particularly large or powerful for the USN. Additionally, the Missouri was decommissioned well before the Iowa or Wisconsin, so if it had to be a BB those latter two make more sense."
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,misunderstandgap,6,Sun Jul 12 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"Mostly because she's the most well known because of her part in the surrender of Japan in ww2.  The Iowa class itself is the strongest battleship the US ever produced seeing as how the Montana's got cancelled, and is itself much more powerful than almirante grau in terms of armament and armor.   The Missouri was the last Iowa to maintain commission ( until 92 whereas the others were 91) mostly because she was seen as a sign of American naval might."
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,BcookieOmonsterB,6,Sun Jul 12 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it wasn't because Missouri was the only ship deployed in Desert Storm?  I understand that a BB is stronger than a CA; I don't see how that's relevant. If Peru owned the Missouri she would certainly be the flagship; if the USN owned the Almirante Grau she would almost certainly be decommissioned.  I made a mistake--the other two ships were put in the fleet reserve, able to be recommissioned, but they were in fact decommissioned first.  It's not clear to me why the USN would need a flagship. There currently isn't a single flagship, so it's not clear what you want the Missouri to do, exactly."
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,misunderstandgap,7,Sun Jul 12 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"The US Navy has a ceremonial flagship the USS Constitution, but she can't hope to keep up with a modern fleet. Whereas the USS Missouri could easily get an admiralty refit and take up the slack as an actual active duty flagship.  Edit She was also not the only Iowa recalled during the runup leading to the gulf war. Wisconsin, Iowa, New Jersey, and Missouri were all recalled."
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,BcookieOmonsterB,9,Sun Jul 12 19:58:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're talking about a ceremonial flagship, not an actual fleet flagship, like the Blue Ridge class or whatever CVN is deployed at the time. Yeah, that would be neat.   Do you have any source that the USS Constitution is currently designated as a flagship?"
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,misunderstandgap,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"It's a navy issuance that they can host foreign dignitaries and are to be treated as a flagship, it's also the way they justify its commission.   And yes I mean as a ceremonial flagship but active duty and 100% seaworthy. I don't like the idea of having a national flagship that can't be taken out of port for treaty signing and shows of power. At this point the Missouri is capable of returning to service with relatively little effort and still be capable of defending itself on a modern battlefield unlike the constitution. It would be nice to have a ship that encompasses our naval victories to use as a mobile show of American military power. Yes carriers are very powerful and capable ships but their not quite as awe/fear inspiring as a ship capable of shooting objects the weight of a vw bug 9 at a time."
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,BcookieOmonsterB,2,Mon Jul 13 02:06:09 2015 UTC,"Many people in the US would not be happy with a flagship named after a single state. It's seems rather excluding, especially considering that Missouri is landlocked."
WarshipPorn,3d0hr9,cessna209,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:45:00 2015 UTC,Well I can't say I enjoy the navy naming scheme either but that's her name. It doesn't seem fair that some of our carriers are named after presidents not everyone liked but it happened.

WarshipPorn,3d0g99,Corinthian82,4,Mon Jul 13 10:41:51 2015 UTC,"The RN went absolutely nuts for anti-flash protection in turrets, hoists and magazines after WWI, so it's reasonable to suppose that had Tiger been kept she would have been modernised to remove that vulnerabitly.   Speaking of modernisation, I wonder if she could have been readily up gunned to 15"" and whether such a plan was ever studied."
WarshipPorn,3d0g99,DrRedOrDead,3,Mon Jul 13 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"I have some books at my disposal giving a complete history of every British battleship ever made, I'll consult them. Gimme a few mins. I'll edit this post.  edit: After consulting ""British Battleships 1919-1945 Revised Edition: R. A. Burt"" and ""British Battleships 'Warrior' 1860 to 'Vanguard' 1950; A History of Design, Construction and Armament; New & Revised Editions: Oscar Parkes""....  (That was a mouthful)  Assuming the the UK did not sign the various Naval treaties (which is why the Tiger was scrapped, and the reason the Royal Navy was ill equiped, for WWII and lost much of its power, which it hasn't recovered from even to this day) and the Tiger was not scrapped. There would have been no upgrading of her guns. This is due to the fact that the ship is essentially designed around her guns, to improve to 15"" would've required such a massive overhaul that it would've been easier to build a larger ship. A change in weight (affects sea capability, speed, weight, turning speed, armour, magazine storage, cordite storage, blowback, etc) from increasing caliber would've required a complete redesign.  At that time, a battleship/battlecruiser lifetime was considered 20 years. The limitations imposed by various naval treaties resulted in the re-design of the the QE class (think Warspite), had the treaties not been in place these ships would've likely been scrapped and new designs built. These ships were built using lessons learnt from before WWI, the new ships would use lessons learnt in WWI to improve our ship design (ammo stowage and handling for example. The lack of an armoured bridge because admirals and captains didn't use them preferring the better visibility of the unarmoured bridge and the fact that hits there were very unlikely).  Incidentally, this designing a ship around her guns is even more evident in the KGV class and her 14"" guns. At the time you would order your guns, then build the battleship. The KGV class has 14"" guns because we had already ordered them and delaying to upgrade to 15"" or 16"" guns would've resulted in her class coming online a year later than planned (1942-1943), which the Admiralty was certain we would be at war. To quote Oscar Parkes:  ""It was essential that guns and mountings should be ordered in June 1936 if the ships were not to be delayed - and yet we did not relish an armament of 14"" when both the U.S and Japan favoured the 16"". Ultimately the time factor decided things. The sense of tension with Germany was rising so fast that it seemed probably that by 1940 - which was the earliest date the first two ships could be finished - we should be at war. A change to the 16"" would mean at least a year's delay; most of our skilled draughtsmen had gone, and it had not been possible with those available to turn out designs for both 14"" and 16"" mountings. True we already had 15"" designs, but on 35,000 tons, a 14"" armament allowed for a better balanced design.""  Indeed all large battleships (The Lion class with her 16"" guns) were cancelled shortly after their hulls we're laid down in order to build ships that could be completed within two years. Vanguard was only constructed as a one off class as when Courageous and Glorious were converted to aircraft carriers, there were 8 x 15"" left over that could be used.  tl:dr ; It would've been nigh impossible for the guns to be upgraded due to a number or reasons. Had the Tiger not been scrapped (i.e had the Washington Naval treaty not been signed) it would've been scrapped anyway and replaced with a more modern ship."

WarshipPorn,3d0lbi,Kytescall,16,Sun Jul 12 14:34:09 2015 UTC,"JMSDF ambitions for a carrier goes back a long time. From the very outset in the early 1950s, the JMSDF considered plans to acquire or lease light carriers from the USN.   This present concept was one of two being considered in the early '60s. The first was the CVH-a, 23,000t vessel that carried 18 HSS-2 (SH-3 Sea King) ASW helicopters and six S-2 Tracker fixed-wing ASW aircraft. The other, the CVH-b, was significantly smaller but was still to carry 18 HSS-2s.  In the 1970s, they considered building a light carrier that could eventually operate Harrier aircraft, assigning funds to study the concept. Work related to this eventually resulted in the Haruna-class helicopter destroyer, which in its early concepts was a through-deck vessel.  But for political and financial reasons carrier-related ambitions remained unrealized, until they got a foot in that door with the Osumi-class dock landing ships commissioned in the late '90s, being the first JMSDF flat tops, although despite appearances they have no hangars and do not carry their own wing of aircraft. The reason they look like carriers is thought to be to make the idea of carriers more politically viable through precedent.  Sure enough, the much more carrier-like Hyuga-class and the Izumo-class helicopter destroyers have entered service. In addition, there is a new amphibious warfare vessel being considered to replace the Osumi-class, which unlike its predecessor will have hangars with the ability to operate helicopters and V-22 Ospreys.  It seems to be increasingly possible that the JMSDF, perhaps when it's time to replace the Hyuga-class, will field something like a true carrier."
WarshipPorn,3d0lbi,Krases,7,Sun Jul 12 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"It seems to be increasingly possible that the JMSDF, perhaps when it's time to replace the Hyuga-class, will field something like a true carrier.   With the US doing its Asian pivot, its possible that the political climate will exist in which Japan is able to field its own carrier battle group.  The US would like that, as an extra carrier battle group would be really handy."

WarshipPorn,3cwslu,base935,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:55:42 2015 UTC,"John Anthony Walker:       John Anthony Walker, Jr. (July 28, 1937 – August 28, 2014) was a United States Navy Chief Warrant Officer and communications specialist convicted of spying for the Soviet Union from 1968 to 1985.   In late 1985, Walker made a plea bargain with federal prosecutors, which required him to testify against his co-conspirator, former senior chief petty officer Jerry Whitworth, and provide full details of his espionage activities. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to a lesser sentence for Walker's son, former Seaman Michael Walker, who was also involved in the spy ring.  During his time as a Soviet spy, Walker helped the Soviets decipher more than one million encrypted naval messages,  organizing a spy operation that The New York Times reported in 1987 “is sometimes described as the most damaging Soviet spy ring in history.”   After Walker's arrest, Caspar Weinberger, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense, concluded that the Soviet Union made significant gains in naval warfare attributable to Walker's spying. Weinberger stated that the information Walker gave Moscow allowed the Soviets ""access to weapons and sensor data and naval tactics, terrorist threats, and surface, submarine, and airborne training, readiness and tactics.""  John Lehman, United States Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration, stated in an interview that Walker's activities enabled the Soviets to know where U.S. submarines were at all times. Lehman said the Walker espionage would have resulted in huge loss of American lives in the event of war.

WarshipPorn,3cwslu,Ferrarity_Mk2,4,Sat Jul 11 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"Enigma Machines had various versions. Before WW2 they were commercially available and there were customers in the UK. Every so often the Wehrmacht and Kriegsmarine would upgrade their Enigmas, and when this happened codebreakers would have to start again, though the Italian Navy was still using very old machines.  The Poles had broken the basic Enigmas since the early 30s, and handed over their research and decoding machines to the allies before the invasion.

WarshipPorn,3cuous,KIAA0319,2,Sat Jul 11 07:33:26 2015 UTC,"The observation periscope is usually larger and has more features.  The periscope head is also bigger, which makes it less ideal for being stealthy."

WarshipPorn,3cuous,hankjmoody,3,Sat Jul 11 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"Well it's certainly easier to take and display images that come directly from the photonics mast compared with a regular periscope.  There might be some benefits, like a broader spectrum of light that you can look at, but the big advantage is that the photonics mast does not penetrate the hull.  Hull penetrations are weak spots in the hull and need to be specially dealt with, adding to the cost of the submarine.  This is why the Block III Virginias have the LAB array instead of a traditional sonar sphere.  The old sphere had lots of hull penetrations, making it more expensive and harder to build.  I imaging photonics masts are actually significantly cheaper for this reason, as well as the greatly reduced maintenance and lack of complicated optics."

The designation is a bit arbitrary as all the submarines in the class got quieter with every overhaul and no two boats are identical, even within the same sub-class.  I know this is an Improved Akula I, or potentially Vepr' or Gepard (Akula II and Akula II Improved/Akula III respectively), because the Radian radar mast only has one parabolic reflector.  The earlier boats had two and it was called the MRKP-58 instead of the 59.  It could be either Vepr' or Gepard, but it's more likely an Akula I Improved since there are more of them."

WarshipPorn,3ctkme,Pete3,3,Sat Jul 11 13:29:55 2015 UTC,"Once Luis Baez (RIP) had the expansion joints put in because the commandant wanted square windows, the 378's could handle anything.  The were the best American ships of the time structurally speaking, hands down.  The Navy studied for year the helicopter landing deck design before they finally accepted that lighter design worked just as good as their heavier design.  I sailed on the Hamilton from Curtis Bay, down the Bay to Boston on an 8 day cruise and it was one of the supreme moments of my life."

WarshipPorn,3ctkme,gergh37,3,Fri Jul 10 19:04:26 2015 UTC,Fascinating - I've never seen a stern like that before. It's like a big fishing trawler. Does the ability to close the stern doors have some practical advantage or is it more of a cosmetic thing?  I guess I would sleep better knowing that pirates couldn't sneak up that ramp at night.
WarshipPorn,3ctkme,sverdrupian,6,Fri Jul 10 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"General safety. If someone falls out of the boat after loading into the ramp or if the hoist fails and the boat drops back down, it's an extra safety measure.   I would also guess the stern wake would flood that area after a quick stop. If they're moving full speed ahead to close a gap during a go fast interdiction, then suddenly slow to deploy the small boat, that area is going to flood."

WarshipPorn,3cpltd,Taliesintroll,5,Thu Jul 9 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"Pictures like this, carrier + escorting DDGs, occasionally make me wonder what it'd look like if they were defending from a missile barrage. Like of each ship as launching two or three missiles at a time what would that look like? A modern version of a carrier surrounded by exploding flak."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,gelinrefira,11,Thu Jul 9 21:29:54 2015 UTC,"IIRC, I read the engagement rules on protecting a carrier group. for one thing, engaging an opponent at sea is often a very complicated affair that require a lot of coordination and sometimes luck.  First an opponent must be able to find the carrier group. This might seem harder than it looks, since most people assume that just because an aircraft carrier is huge and its escorts numerous, it will be easy to find them. But the open ocean is huge and trying to find a carrier group which has near unlimited range (fleet either has a dedicated oiler or the carrier can basically fuel other ships, the carrier itself has unlimited range) performing evasive maneuvers is pretty hard. Even the best search radar can have about a maximum range of 100 nm at the limit of the curvature of the Earth, and that is not a lot if you are trying to find a fleet in the middle of an ocean millions of sq km wide. Air search radar usually have longer range because it can search beyond the horizon but we are trying to find ships.  So radar coverage by an aggressor is the first problem they have to solve to even engage a carrier fleet. If you can't find your opponent, you cant engage them.  Usually, the first line of defense is patrolling airborne early warning (AEW) and fighters. The AEW increase the range that the fleet can see for hundreds of kilometers further than any ship radar can do. Any aggressor will have to somehow sneak past this radar screen to even target the fleet, assuming they even know where it is. So it is very hard to surprise a carrier group. Usually any ship(s) trying to shadow a carrier group would have been detected long before its ASM can come into range.   Some of the longest range supersonic ASM, the ones that can even have chance to penetrate the defenses has less than 300 km range. Any ship operating in an aggressive manner within this range would have been flagged by the AEW and everyone will be on high alert. To carry enough missiles to saturate the defense of the patrolling fighters air-air missiles and the escorting air defense destroyers and cruisers will require a lot of opposing destroyers. If the Chinese or Russian suddenly start shadowing a carrier group with 5 destroyers or more, that will already be a huge incident. More fighters will be likely be scrambled and the air around the carrier could be saturated with fighters ready to launch their own ASM at the aggressors should even something is amiss. All escorts themselves will be on high alert.  Assuming that someone got crazy and a fleet of destroyers are shadowing the fleet suddenly without warning start using their targeting radar and swarm fire all their ASM missiles. The first line will be the fighters own air to air missiles, followed by all the escorts  antimissile missiles at mid range, then at short range CIWS weapons. It is calculated that a single Burke's saturation is about 12 ASMs like BrahMos. A typical carrier group will have at least 1 Tico crusier, 2 to 3 Burkes, which means that to saturate the escorts' mid range missile defense, the aggressor probably need to fire about 48 to 60 ASM. That is a lot of fucking missiles. Suffice to say, it is not easy to attack a carrier group."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,ewanc9,2,Thu Jul 9 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"""Even the best search radar can have about a maximum range of 100 nm at the limit of the curvature of the Earth"", I assume you don't mean nanometres?"
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,gelinrefira,2,Sat Jul 11 01:30:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, nautical miles."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,ewanc9,2,Sat Jul 11 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating the range a bit there, sure the signal attenuates but refraction should carry the signal well beyond a 100nm, no idea how much this affects accuracy , but I sill feel like the range would be greater. Reflection, sorry, wrong word."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,FreeUsernameInBox,2,Sat Jul 11 01:42:56 2015 UTC,"For a horizon target, the Type 45 has a longer detection range than the BURKE class, because its radar is higher. That was a deliberate design decision, and is why the Sampson radar is a two-faced rotating array rather than a 4-faced fixed one. The USN cheats and puts a second radar at 25,000 feet and 200 knots to solve the horizon issue.  Odd atmospheric conditions can carry the signal further, but require specialised radars to do so reliably and aren't accurate enough for anything more than early warning."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,ewanc9,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:10:29 2015 UTC,"well they already stretch beyond the visible horizon anyway, my point was that the signal will bounce off the ionosphere to some extent and not just fuck off into space."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,gelinrefira,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"It is possible. I was just quoting the range on the SPY-1, which is about 100 nm for surface ships searching, it can search up to 250 nm for air targets. Newer, more powerful radar might have longer range and better resolution, still, I don't think it is much improvement."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,ewanc9,2,Sat Jul 11 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yeh, just wondered, it's probably not the sort of info that's just released, and if it is, I wonder if it's accurate."
WarshipPorn,3cpltd,gelinrefira,2,Sat Jul 11 02:12:37 2015 UTC,Well the radar system has been around for a while and it's just physics so it is more like an open secret. Plus many other countries have developed similar radar systems as the SPY-1 AEGIS so it is not that other countries have no information about the limitations of the radar.

WarshipPorn,3comnl,NoahtheRed,9,Thu Jul 9 20:33:17 2015 UTC,The Italians had some good war machines but lacked the effective command and logistics to effectively employ them in battle in any meaning full way.
WarshipPorn,3comnl,goooooller,5,Thu Jul 9 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"I can accept that statement.  Considering that, despite the extensive rebuilds of the Cavours, these were the first large warships designed and built in Italy since the end of the Great War, they weren't as bad as they could have been.  Especially considering the financial situation the Italians were in."
WarshipPorn,3comnl,sw04ca,6,Fri Jul 10 02:24:40 2015 UTC,Such a beautiful ship. What made her sub par compared to her contenders?
WarshipPorn,3comnl,Jonosurf75,6,Thu Jul 9 19:05:33 2015 UTC,lack of effective AA defense is the one that sticks in my mind.

WarshipPorn,3comnl,trk2,9,Thu Jul 9 21:22:50 2015 UTC,Not really but the design of Italian AA was awful.
WarshipPorn,3comnl,goooooller,2,Thu Jul 9 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how we're defining ""before the war"", but the AA suite of the North Carolina class was arguably pretty good for the time."
WarshipPorn,3comnl,broadgauge53,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"North Carolina-class battleship:       The __North Carolina* class_ was a class of two fast battleships, North Carolina and Washington, built for the United States Navy in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The navy was originally uncertain whether the ships should be fast enough to counter the Japanese Kongō class, which was believed by the United States to be capable of 26 knots (30 mph; 48 km/h), or should sacrifice speed for additional firepower and armor. The Second London Naval Treaty's requirement that all capital ships have a standard displacement of under 35,000 long tons (35,560 metric tons) prevented the desired objectives from being fully realized within its limits, and the navy considered over fifty designs before one was chosen.
