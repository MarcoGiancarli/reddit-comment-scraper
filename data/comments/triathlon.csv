My favorite part is the community--I swear, it's like ALL triathletes are nice. They will answer questions, cheer you on, and just be super nice and friendly. It doesn't matter how fast or slow you are; the group is just freakishly happy."

I have lots of questions, and most importantly, from experience, I have noticed being on a team makes everyone do better. I hope to get cheered on, and I hope to cheer on others. I'm always that weird guy that will cheer on random people running in the park. Maybe it won't be so weird at the super sprint.."

In fact, I'll be riding the South part of the lakepath in just a little bit.  I feel like a kid on the bike.  It's hard to describe in words..  I smile just thinking about it.  I love biking!!  I have knocked out about 11 marathons and do enjoy running, but need the cycling to balance things out.  I get bored running, to be honest.    Swimming..  Bleh.  As /u/MaIngallsisaracist stated, the community is amazing!  My wife and I are both members of the Chicago Triathlon Club and highly recommend it!  I have been incredibly busy, so haven't had much time this year for much of the social-side of it.  But it's fantastic and a great group!  I suggest going to the next monthly meeting.  It's on August 5th at the Goose Island on Clybourn.  It's an incredibly friendly group who are also good motivators to keep going!  Anyway, welcome to the sport and I hope the first race goes excellent!!!!"

I also love running, but it gets old really quick. So I am excited that it's in the middle of the two activities.  I would really like to go to that meeting. I have been meaning to get more involved in communities in Chicago, but when you're in College, all of your friends are too stoned to do anything besides get more stoned.  Anyway, thanks for the motivation, I can't wait for the race!"
triathlon,3e44k0,yellowsnocone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:26:13 2015 UTC,"Did my first try when I was 14 I think...?  It was a sprint, and I was an athletic kid, and my grandparents saw an ad for one and thought it was cool, told my parents about it, and next thing I knew I was in the water as the youngest contestant wearing a speedo whilst everyone around me had on all sorts of fancy tri gear.  Their reason was that I ""had too much energy"" and since they had a friend who was about my size into cycling, they borrowed an old Bianchi from him and thew me in.  Ended up winning my age group (I was the only one....) and running around a 1:15:00.    As far as my favorite part of being a triathlete, I love both the challenge and the people.  Haven't done a full IM yet (that'll come next summer, ideally) though half's are fun.  The people at all events I've been to though are some of the friendliest I've met, probably out of mutual respect because these races are NOT easy by any means (even sprints can suck if you push yourself to it).    All being said, good luck with your first, and good luck!  Oh, and after you finish you'll begin to notice a few symptoms, such as deciding your bike needs ""just one more upgrade"", or ""one more pair of shoes won't hurt..."", and ""is a race a week for two months ok?"".  Don't worry too much though, just give in to the cravings and soon you'll be in the same boat as many of us, getting up at 4:30 to ride before school and work, and finishing the day with a swim/run and yoga.  Cheers!"

triathlon,3e2q4j,nebboh,6,Tue Jul 21 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned it comes down to personal preference and many times your stomachs ability to handle what you feed it. Luckily I have an iron stomach so on the run I just use what is out on the course knowing that it'll be fine. The best advice someone ever gave to me for nutrition on long course is to make it as simple as possible. I was asking him about what to have in my bottles, how many gels to take, how much fluid I need, what kind of solid foods to have and he just stopped me there. He recommended that I try what he does (obviously with testing before a race) to make a highly concentrated bottle of nutrition (I had ~900 calories in one bottle) and let that be the fuel for the bike. Each 24oz bottle would last me 3 hours and the other cage had water as did by aero bar bottle. At each station I would refill by aero bottle with the bottle in the back and swap out for a new water bottle at the aid station. The only thing I added was I would have 1/3 of a clif bar every hour just to throw some solid food in there because there is no worse feeling than being hungry out there.   As for brands, I like Infinit. For 70.3 and up I use the Go Far mixture. I'd put a total of three servings in one bottle along with the powder from endurolytes and take down 8oz every hour. Tastes pretty good but you'll definitely want plenty of water to wash it down because it gets a little thick with that much powder in one bottle."
triathlon,3e2q4j,dabear04,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice!  Like you said, it's easy to read all this information and think about how many gels/fluids/solids you think you need.  The 70.3 I'm doing in Oct says it will have 3 bottle exchange stations on the bike (about every 13 miles) with the 2nd station having HEED instead of water.  The run portion will have stations every 1.5 miles with HEED/other fuel at every other station."
triathlon,3e2q4j,dabear04,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good set up for the bike. For the run most races I've done have stations every mile but I think I'd approach this similarly. At every station I would take down Heed/Gatorade/Infinit (whatever they had there) and then every third station I take down a gel. if they were 1.5 miles apart then I would maybe do every other depending on the length and how I was feeling but practice your runs like you will race. If you plan on using what's on the course, take a bottle with you on your long runs and just drink every 1.5 miles to simulate the race."
triathlon,3e2q4j,Jennyvs1011,3,Tue Jul 21 17:47:28 2015 UTC,I have three bottle holders on bike.... I use them all...2 water 1 nutrition and grab more  bottles of water at bike aid stations.  I usually eat a pb&j sandwich (or 2 for full IM) on the bike but for last 15-20 miles stick only to gels. Thing is..  Nutrition is very personal.  Some people only use liquid.... Some use all gels....  Gotta play around with it in training to see what works best.  For the run... I carry nothing.  I rely on aid stations only.  I do not like having anything in my hands and fuel belts bounce too much for my liking.
triathlon,3e2q4j,reopye_Fe,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"Why do you need 3 bottles? I would've thought 2 would be enough, assuming you're filling up regularly at aid stations. an extra bottle is just extra weight."
triathlon,3e2q4j,dabear04,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"I always kept an extra water on the off chance something went wrong. I'd rather add the extra weight (pretty insignificant) for the off chance one of my bottles goes flying and breaks. Shouldn't happen for my aero cage but it has definitely come loose before. Also, I've done races where there was only a station every 22 miles and it was pretty hilly. I aimed for ~24oz of water every hour so I was usually refilling before I made it to the station.   This is only for 70.3 or longer. Oly or shorter it's usually just one bottle depending on what is out on the course."
triathlon,3e2q4j,Jennyvs1011,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:22 2015 UTC,One bottle is a disposable......  And that's the one I replace at aid stations.....  I'm really not worried about the extra weight... I'm a 6 hr half finisher and that is nowhere near good enuf for podium...  Say I take with me what I think I'll need to complete
triathlon,3e2q4j,Suckat3,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"70.3 athlete responding.  I have a Profile Design BTA bottle up front with 3 scoops of Heed. Another bottle of water behind the saddle in a gorilla cage zip tied to the seat. I'll also go through Gu or chews; no set number, just every 30-60 minutes and/or if hungry. One or two salt tabs if it's hot out. BTA is handy; behind the saddle is aero. Rear bottle I don't reach for frequently, only when I need it for flushing after peeing on the bike, which I try to time with refilling the BTA bottle with the remainder.  On the run, I've packed along a fuel belt at races where the nutrition wasn't something I was experienced with. Favorite combo there is Coke and water, common on many courses so I've rarely had to carry my own. Red Bull is also nice.  I've been experimenting this season with keeping solid food to a minimum on race morning. Definitely none during the race. Powerade and Gatorade don't agree with me near the run, so I don't go for them while racing or training (but will to pre-fuel or after a long workout).  What does this mean for you? Not a damn thing, I'm afraid. What works for me was arrived at after months of trial and error, and it's still an evolving process. The best thing to do is to keep it simple and cheap while experimenting. The pointless thing to do is to overthink it."
triathlon,3e2q4j,TriathlonNerd,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"Coach/Retail shop owner here:  First, you need to figure out what works for you.  The necessary calories can be solid, gel, gummy, liquid... just as long as you've tested it and it works for you.  During your training you'll want to experiment with timing and amounts to get your nutrition plan dialed in.  I always suggest weighing yourself before and after your long workouts.  Keep track of how many calories you had per hour, how much water, salt tabs, temperature, how much weight you lost and how you felt.  You'll end up with a spreadsheet of data that will help you plan.  Once you know what you need, then you can figure out how much you need to carry and where.  Generally, most of the athletes I see will keep a bento box on their frame for solid or semi-solid nutrition.  A between-the-arm bottle for water.  And either frame or behind the saddle mounted cages if they do liquid nutrition  For my clients: I want them carrying whatever they need when they train, but only what's necessary when they race.  I'm not a huge fan of liquid nutrition.  It takes up a lot of real estate; both on the bike and in your stomach.  Gels and the like are lighter weight and simple.  I'll have them test what will be offered on the course.  If they like it, they only need to carry 1 gel and 1 bottle of water.  Then grab what they need at each aid station.  If the product that works for them is different, they'll carry it from the start and just use their single aero bottle and refill at each aid station."
triathlon,3e2q4j,Eskir00,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"I did my first 70.3 5 weeks a go and nutrition was one of the things I was most concerned about. On the bike I had one bottle with electrolyte tablets. At the aid stations I binned that old bottle and picked up 2 news bottles, one with sports drink and one with water. I nailed these and replenished at the next station.   I set an alarm on my watch which beeped every 15 minutes to remind me to eat and drink. I'm not a fan of gels, so I had a bento bag with shot blocks, flapjack and veggie colin caterpillars (sweets you get from M&S), kind of a veggie alternative to jelly babies. I grabbed half a banana at each station as well.   On the run I had nothing, only because I knew that they had aid stations on every mile. I'd eaten enough on the bike to keep my going, but during transition I had a handful of sweets and a small packet of salted nuts.   On the run I alternated between sports drink, water and coke and between bananas and gels.   If I were racing somewhere that didn't have this many aid stations,I would recommend buying a hydration belt. Fill yourself up at every aid station and top your bottles up as well. You should also have enough room for shotblocks or dextrose. If you take gels, it's a great idea to fill a bottle with as many as you can and dilute it with some water and add a pinch of salt. Saves you having to mess about with sticky gel wrappers etc.   Sorry for waffling :)  Oh, one last thing! One the bike stations, STOP and take the bottles from the marshalls. The number of people I saw trying to grab bottles at top speed, only to knock them out of the marshalls hands was stupid. The rider didn't get their fluids and marshalls had to sprint on to the roads to pick up rogue bottles.   Walk every aid station as well. I was given this advice at briefing and I cannot tell you what a difference it makes. Walk and make sure you get your fluids and nutrition before setting off on your run again."
triathlon,3e2q4j,reopye_Fe,2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"What type of equipment (belts, water bottles, pouches) is essential for these races?   It depends on your nutrition strategy, but in general two water bottles and a means of transporting your own nutrition on the bike are essential (either taping to your top tube, putting in jersey pockets or having a top tube bag). Aid stations are usually far more frequent on the run so if you're using course nutrition you can potentially run with nothing. If you've got your own specific strategy then you may need a running bottle belt or a tri-top with pockets for gels.   Any specific brands you can recommend?   Ask a hundred different triathletes and you'll get a hundred different answers. Personally I train with High5 because they put a lot of effort into justifying the science behind their formulae, it's affordable, and my triathlon team (and my old university club) get a lot of freebies from them.  At the end of the day it's whatever works for you - I met one Ironman whose nutrition strategy was to eat half a giant baguette in T1, eat the other half at the midway point of the bike, and take on coke and flapjack on the run. Not the most efficient mechanism, but he wasn't going for podium spots and just doing it for a laugh.   What has worked well for you?   When I first started out, I worked on a bottle of Energy Source an hour, supplemented with 3 gels an hour (one caffeinated) and the occasional solid when needed (a Clif bar or half a banana). Now, I race entirely on liquids - concentrated High5 on the bike, isogels on the run. Many people will struggle to not consume solids in the 8-17 hours that an Ironman takes but I've trained myself to not need them. It makes nutrition much easier and saves time at aid stations.  At the end of the day, your nutrition strategy doesn't matter as long as:  1) You're getting enough electrolytes and calories (preferably a mix glucose, fructose and other carbs) and  2) You've practiced it extensively in the months leading up to the race.   I'm also curious to know how many bottles you may have on your bike, or what you have with you on your run.   I have one bottle cage behind my saddle and an aerobottle between my tribars. The aerobottle contains a concentrated mix of Energy Source which I top up with water from aid stations (stored in the saddle bottle). I take 3-4 isogels an hour on the run, and don't need to stop for water (assuming I hydrate well on the bike)."
triathlon,3e2q4j,Triafweet,2,Tue Jul 21 21:03:31 2015 UTC,"I myself CANNOT take gels. After all the half marathons and other sporting events, I recently took a few and puked at around 10k on a 15k run.  Not sure what to alternate between, I enjoy bricks but I will continue to experiment"
triathlon,3e2q4j,triit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm blessed with a pretty hearty stomach... But I also deliberately train by eating and drinking pretty much anything I can get my hands on.  That includes alternating between gels and bars and gummies, caffeine or not, etc.  I pick up samples at race expos or in race goodie bags just to try.  If the race publishes what brand they're using on course, I will pick up some singles of that just to make sure it doesn't disagree with me but I won't necessarily train exclusively on it.  I have found certain things that work (salty rather than sweet electrolyte drinks, accel gels with protein on long bikes, Roctane gels on the run, etc.) so I will make sure to start with those but pick up whatever else is on course.  Only GI problems I've ever had were on my first 50k that was unexpectedly hot and aid stations were not well stocked."

triathlon,3e3bts,Suckat3,0,Wed Jul 22 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"Non-athletes are not allowed in the transition area, likely due to liability, keeping them out of the way of the race, and maintaining some measure of security over all the stuff in there. Or some combination.  Wetsuit goes on the bike rack to start drying. Makes it easier to pack out at the end of the race if it isn't crumpled and soggy.  Shoes–if you practiced the flying mount, and race rules allow, mount them on the bike ahead of time. Otherwise put them in the transition area beneath your bike; put them on when you get there, head to the mount line, and get on the bike.  Clothes–What wardrobe change(s) are you anticipating? Doing none would save time, but if that's not possible it'll be similar; get to your transition, pick up whatever clothes you need on the bike or on the towel you have laid out with the rest of your stuff. Put them on. Go. Don't overthink it.  Google image/video ""transition area setup"" if you want to see how others have done it. And have fun!"

Only do this if the racks are uncrowded. At at least 80% of my races, the racks are way too crowded. A wetsuit that is on the rack where my bike needs to go is going to get flung.  Instead, fold your wetsuit in half and put it behind your running shoes. This way, it doesn't get smushed or in anyones way."
triathlon,3e3bts,Suckat3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose I could have added if space allows to clarify, but I've considered the transition area, once set up prior to the race with everyone racked, to be an indicator of available space and a small stake of real estate.

At the end of the race, your wetsuit, kit, shoes, etc are going to be a disgusting mess.  You need to go home & clean it anyway.

My body is a dirty liar, it always wants to stop and have a beer instead of cycling or running as fast as I can. I use data I have captured in training to push my performance in a race.   Some people have the opposite problem, on race day they feel like they can go out twice as fast as they did in training. As my coach says, you don't go to sleep a 8:00/mi runner and wake up a 6:00/mi runner. Those people need data to keep them from blowing up in the first half of a race.  Don't let the data rule you, but use it to make informed decisions and guide you to your optimal race."

She has a bike-mounted Garmin, mainly so she can pre-program and navigate century rides. The Garmin comes along during races since it's already on the bike, but her only metric throughout is a simple stopwatch.  For the life of me, I think it's crazy. But then again, she KQ'd and went last year, shortly before qualifying for 70.3 Worlds where she'll compete next month. KQ, Kona, and the qualifying 70.3 race were all before the Garmin, with just a Timex Ironman stopwatch.  I'm still baffled by it because I love my data, but for some people they just don't have that drive for data."

triathlon,3e1jog,RDMvb6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"Start with a sprint tri- it'll ease you into the swim and it's short enough that you usually don't need a wetsuit. Wetsuits are made to last a LONG time, so don't freak out at the cost. I paid $400 for mine and love it. You can rent wetsuits as well if you aren't sure it's something you'll stick with. Not all tris allow wetsuits- it depends on the water temperatures- it can get quite hot wearing one while sprinting in warm water!  I've swam competitively and in open water my whole life, and I've used my speedo vanquishers ($15) my entire career. Just get a pair that are tinted dark so the sun isn't too bright! For the swim, as long as you can see the nearest buoy in the water, you're fine. The hardest part for you will be the swim. Get in as many yards as possible and do at LEAST five swims in open water- it's a very different experience from either pools or floating and playing around in a lake.    Others here are more knowledgable about the other stuff, so I'll let them talk about that :)"

Get goggles with prescription lenses (http://www.swimoutlet.com/guides/how-to-choose-prescription-goggles/) and get swimming lessons. You will feel better in water within 2-3 weeks. Trust me - my girlfriend just started swimming, and she is improving with the speed of light - at the begining she was not able to swim 25m freestyle - now she swims 100m. :)"

If you're biking and moving in to a run, you have to ""finish"" your bike, and start a new ""run"" on the watch.  It's annoying. No open water swim support.  There are hacks (you can use ""freestyle"" mode), but it's a definite shortcoming.  This is probably why there is no true multisport mode."

It's big flaws are the no true multisport mode and the open water as other have mentioned. But outside of that it's usability and setup are really great to get the data out of it as you want and for individual sport training!  So the value is great, just not the best in the business"

I really want to go sub-5 on 8/15, and my splits for my first race in June were as follows:  Swim: 35 min Bike: 2 hrs 29 minutes Run: 2 hrs 3 min Transitions: 8 minutes (long run to T1)   My run really suffered due to hills and a lack of solid nutrition on the bike.  I PR'd in the half marathon at 1:34:50 in April (not during a triathlon), and know I can get the half down to 1:45-50.  I also plan on shaving some time during transitions and the swim because I swam at a pretty relaxed pace in the race."

I did some pretty nice Mountains on my bike, and this improved my cycling a lot.  In the PR race, I held an average of 201 Watts, which now is moderate ride for me. Besides that, I did everything else I was doing for past seasons - a lot of low intensity running, and swimming intervals - building my base, and some strenght.   How do I want to cut 22 minutes? I just raced 1/4 IM (yes, in my countries this distance is actually popular). I've cycled 45km at 245 Watts, and my time was 1:08 for the cycling part. I've improved in swimming as well (I think because I've switched from 25m to 50m swimming pool). My Swimming leg in this race was 12:20. Runningwise, I ran 40'. That was total of 2:05 for distance of 1/4 IM.  I think I am able to hold little less watts on bike - 220-230, and still run at 1:25 in HIM. This would shave around 15' on bike,  7' on running. :)"

Also found a group in my town that does a really fast (22-23 mph+) 30 mile ride twice a week. Very excited to join them regularly and fight to stay with the lead pack.

I competed in the NJ State Sprint as a warmup for my half-ironman this Sat, which is a tune-up for IMMD in October.  I wasn't really sure where my training was, but I ended up winning my age group and finishing just outside of the top ten overall (a tad disappointing...), but decent pacing for my first of the season."

I think it is somewhat specific but I can show you a few examples.  One, I use a pair of hand weights, hold them straight out in front, and then pull them in towards your sides, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades behind out.  Do 2 sets of 15.  Sky punches, just lay on your back with a hand weight in one hand, arm fully extended upwards.  Push the weight upwards lifting the shoulder blade.  Do 2 sets of 15 on each side.  I have been doing mostly upper body with her so far but I will be getting into lower body soon.  Seems to help as I have been having some upper body muscle issues and these exercises have been helping, more so than chiro it seems."

triathlon,3dxjbr,cjl4959,2,Mon Jul 20 12:36:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on how injured you are to be honest...I had a raging IT band problem and I needed to take three months off and start from scratch.  Was able to keep endurance via cycling and swimming.  Rest, stretching, foam rolling, ibuprofen, rest, and hip exercises can all help.  Of those, foam rolling and stretching are a must, and the hip exercises can help to prevent future issues.  I find the pigeon pose to be a very helpful stretch.  Since it's been several days, you have to feel it out right now.  it's possible it was just a short term thing.  Try going for a light one-mile run and see how it goes.  if, at any point, you start to feel the onset of pain, stop and walk back.  Rest is extremely important right now and, while it sucks to take a week or two off, two weeks off now is better than three months or more."

triathlon,3dtxnj,Suckat3,2,Sun Jul 19 14:08:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Like I said, I took it for a ride the wednesday before the race and it seemed okay.  It was strange because it was almost like as the bike became more broken in, the problem developed.  Kinda like the 25mm tires barely fit at first then due to break in after just a couple miles, they started rubbing.  But my new 23 tires have a lot of clearance.  Also not sure what you mean by wrenching.  I can change a tire and stuff but I just assumed that the bike shop provided the correct size.  Won't make that mistake again."

triathlon,3dtxnj,pihb,2,Sun Jul 19 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"A good rule of thumb is to put at least 100 miles on any new bike before using it for events. this allows for you to truly test it out with turning, braking, rubbing, flats, positions adjustments, etc. It also allows for your cables to stretch so you can take it back to the LBS to get re-tensioned so you don't have hiccups during gear changes."

He was one of the early adopters of bikes with non-traditional frames, but he's relatively unknown outside Europe/UK so his brand wouldn't have the cachet of say ""Lemond"" if there was still a Lemond brand."

triathlon,3dus33,ohyeahitsme4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:53 2015 UTC,I posted this in a previous discussion about tires on velo  GP4000s almost mythical status makes everyone overlook the fact that they're actually very mediocre tires. The sidewall issue is a massive flaw and enough for me to never ride them anymore. They don't actually have great feel either. A large amount of the love for them is mostly newish riders who start reading about them and end a parroting everything that is written all over the net.  Already looking through the comments everyone is saying GP4000's 25mm... 25mm tires on narrow rims are awful. Even 23mm GP4000's are massive tires. If you have narrow rims get some 21 or 22mm Specialized S-Works Turbo or Zipp Tangents. Latex tubes are going to make the largest difference. You will actually notice an improvement with this set up. GP4000's are shit.

It was a mostly down-river swim in the sprint and it was my fastest swim ever - but it was tricky getting back to shore - you had to kind of aim at a point upstream from it or you end up going in a big arc, swimming farther than you had to.  All my other swims have been in lakes and I think I generally prefer them.  There's just less flotsam in the lakes compared to rivers.  But you're right; the down-river swim was great!  It got choppy due to a big boat passing in the channel, so after taking a big breath of water, I switched to kind of a breast-stroke and just bobbed along all the way back.  The funny thing is, with all the other running events they do at Sauvie Island, I've wondered why there isn't a triathlon out there.  Turns out this event was just across the river from Sauvie Island, at Frenchman's Bar in Vancouver.  I hope you can come back out to Oregon sometime for a triathlon - we have some great ones!"

triathlon,3dqcsy,Professor226,12,Sat Jul 18 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"Novice:  Triathlon is a ""hobby"". Brand new to the sport (1-2 seasons maximum), races on a road bike/commuter bike/mountain bike, most likely races sprint/olympic distance if they have any sense. Spends most of their time shitposting on /r/triathlon, asking questions like ""Can I swim in cycling gear?"" and ""I can't swim and I don't know how to ride a bike, can I train to Ironman in 8 weeks?"". The vets of /r/triathlon answer your questions patiently as we've all been there before.  Intermediate:  Triathlon is a ""lifestyle"". Symptoms include: owning more than one bike for training/racing, using precious vacation time for training camps, having a coach, training up to 6 days a week, etc. At this point you might be embarking in longer distance such as Ironman, and can normally bash out a 5:30 or a sub-13. The podium for your age group is definitely not in reach yet, however. Your training may be a bit more structured - where before you simply went out for a training run or ride, now you think more about intervals, fartleks and training zones.  Advanced:  Triathlon is a way of life. Your entire world revolves around what training you're doing on a particular day. Unfortunately, that includes dating, which means that unless you are going out with someone who is equally driven and passionate about something similar, you're probably single. Your racing bike is worth more than your car, and is probably serviced more often. Your obsession with data is driven to the limit and you talk pretty much only in acronyms - FTP, V Dot, CSS, VO2 Max...  You're at the stage where you are likely to get onto the podium for your AG, depending on who turns up. You can enter any individual event (such as a 10km run, an open water swim race etc) and you are likely to finish in the top 10% of the field. And that's fair enough, considering you probably train somewhere between 10-20 hours a week depending on intensity. And yes, you probably shave your legs and piss on the bike."

Thinking over the triathletes I know personally, there are two I would rate as advanced. Both are good at the sport, having raced national and world events in their respective disciplines. But the thing I value most is the breadth of their journey; thousands of hours, thousands of race miles and exponentially more logged in training, and a lot of knowledge accumulated in that time. There's an attitude, a sense of comfort, and wisdom there–not that what they say is gospel, but that it's borne out of experience rather than naiveté or parroting SlowTwitch articles. They're not afraid of ego, or to be wrong, but are pretty damn confident in themselves and their time-tested approaches.  Speed is nice. It matters, it wins races. But there are plenty of people who come in with raw talent and no sense of strategy, or they burn out or fade away with injuries too soon. To me part of being advanced is training and racing smart and in the context of longevity.  Intermediate, I guess a season or two. I'm not new anymore, but I'm years away from advanced.  Your post doesn't say how long you'd expect a person to hold those paces, but to play along for fun my last open 10k was at a 7:15/mile pace (4:30/km, maybe the very definition of intermediate?). 5:09 PR 70.3, 271 FTP."

I've never done an Oly, and my first full is coming is still 9 months away, so I don't have a complete picture to share across all distances.  The only 70.3 I've done so far this season, the HM pace was 8:03/mile  (5:00/km). Granted, that course also had 1,657 ft/505m elevation gain.   No sprints this season, and the only one I did last year was off-road for the run. 8:18 pace.  I have Timberman coming up next month, then IM 70.3 AZ in October. Depending on conditions, I'm hoping for a 7:30-7:45 pace on the run. Losing weight has also helped. I've gone mostly vegetarian this season and shed about 7 lbs. Less to carry around the course and it's also helped improve power/weight on the bike too."

triathlon,3dq64t,Suckat3,2,Sat Jul 18 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"I had a similar decision to make and ended up going with an aero road bike (Cervelo S5). I put on some aerobars and adjust the position a bit, and it turns into a pretty nice bike for triathlons.   There are slight disadvantages in both situations but overall I think the S5 hit a perfect sweet spot. You won't get the lightest bike for your road rides, and it's not quite as aero as a purpose built tri bike."
triathlon,3dq64t,Hipstoreus_Maximus,2,Sat Jul 18 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"How serious are you about triathlon? I would say that since you already have a road bike, get a tri bike. You wil get more out of it for your races than with an upgraded road bike."
triathlon,3dq64t,asad137,2,Sat Jul 18 15:46:36 2015 UTC,I've a carbon road bike with aero bars. It's a nice in-betweener since I'm still an intermediate triathlete according to this thread. The bike and bars are fitted and have been great for training purposes.     I would get a TT bike if I get to a point where I start shaving my legs for faster times.
triathlon,3dq64t,yellowsnocone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"Depends. Are you comfortable in an aero position? Getting a tri bike could improve your speed and save your legs for the run, but it won't do much if you find yourself on the hoods the whole time. If you're fairly flexible and have decent neck/back health, I say go for it. There's a lot of new tech coming out now and prices seem to be dropping on 3+ year old bikes, so you'll probably get a good deal if you go used."

triathlon,3dpci8,heelflipp900,3,Sat Jul 18 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"Is the swim in open water?  If so, than it's pretty different than swimming in a pool. There's people around you, you can't see the bottom, you'll be kicked at least once maybe knocking your goggles off, you need to sight to figure out what the shape of the course is too! This can be kind of avoided by staying to the back of the pack..but then you may not be happy with your result. A general rule of thumb is being able to swim double the open water swim distance than you can swim in the pool.   Honestly I think it's doable if you can practice once or twice in the water, try to sight and get used to being in dark water."
triathlon,3dpci8,heelflipp900,5,Sat Jul 18 06:21:22 2015 UTC,"We've both grown up at the beach, swimming and body surfing and what not, so the ocean is ok with us.

triathlon,3dpci8,grandzooby,3,Sat Jul 18 06:31:57 2015 UTC,"I said the same thing but then I got freaked out when I was 500m out into the lake and couldn't see or float down and touch the bottom and couldn't see the shore after getting kicked in the face and lost my goggles... ;). I've found that everyone has a different reaction though, so I'm just erring on the side of caution.   Yes! They have to have markers! The shape of the swim course should be on the website.  Cool, be careful though.. Once you get bitten by the bug you've just spend $1500+ on gear!  Also for the swim you can wear something like jammers or thicker compression shorts (modesty isn't a huge issue, just use common sense). Then put on a pair of running shorts / athletic shorts on top for the rest of the race. Bike shorts if you have them are also a good option with no need for running shorts."

Since it's an ocean swim, I'll guess the shape of the swim is a box, as in you swim 200m, swim lateral 100m, then swim back 200m. They should have these large triangular yellow buoys for use.  On the website they say its about 68F water temperature. For comparison most lap pools are 75-80 (where I'm from at least). So wetsuits are not really necessary at this temperature (I wouldn't wear one at least) However.. if you are not experienced with swimming in open water, I'd suggest getting one. The security you get because you can just float in the water with it on can easily quell any fears. Plus they make you swim faster!  E: Cool! After a quick google search found this for the swim portion:   Sarah Turner Over Does anyone have any specifics about the swim portion? Is it a 1 buoy out-and-back? Two buoys? Is the entry and exit in the same spot? Is the swim south-to-north or north-to-south? Any info would be appreciated.

triathlon,3dpci8,grandzooby,2,Sat Jul 18 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"We should probably get wetsuits, right?   Buying one will probably set you back about $300, but many tri-shops will rent them for a lot less.  One in town here lets you apply your rental fees to a purchase if you decide to buy after.  Are you stationed at Camp Pendleton?  When I was in the army, the base had an office that had athletic and outdoor equipment to check out.  I have no idea if this included wetsuits.  If you're in school, many universities have a similar office where you can cheaply rent outdoor gear."

There's no real need to shave past anything being covered by your Tri kit, but I usually shave or trim down my chest and back for aesthetics.

I do arms, legs, chest, and back. Pits I hit a few times per year with an electric trimmer. Under the tri shorts, just go with personal preference. I have taken the bush down with shaving in the past and it hasn't been a problem keeping up 10+ hour training weeks or during races.   On the arms, I do it for consistency. Aero gains from arm shaving are negligible. Some will tell you biker's wisdom dictates that road rash is less injurious and it's easier to debride hairless skin."

I had knee surgery last December and those surgical razors leave a very sharp line.  So even after it had grown in a bit, it looked like the jungle that normally goes from my ankles all the way up looked like they had been clear-cut around the knee.    This looked really funny when I wore shorts, so I took a set of clippers, put on a 5 or 6 on there and trimmed up the whole leg to kind of match the knee area - then did the other leg to match.  It was easy to blend it all together that way.  Maybe a close trim like that might achieve what you're after.  Until I drop another 50 pounds and I'm in the top 5 shooting for top 3, I won't bother with performance enhancing things like shaving for a race."

triathlon,3dpbf8,Suckat3,2,Sat Jul 18 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"I've found that even just compared to running-only events, the people in triathlons tend to be friendlier.  I'm one of those guys who will cheer the other athletes on as we pass (say on an out-and-back, or if they just flat out pass me) and the response is typically positive... lots of smiles and many returned hoots and claps.  When I've done that on running-only events (it's just my nature!), I tend to get annoyed looks or the runner is startled out of listening to their headphones.  Doing triathlons has definitely taken some of the joy out of doing 5ks and such.  But I have such a blast at tris that it's worth it.  All that said, I try not to do too much of my cheering for the obviously more elite athletes - they don't seem to care for it or just don't respond.  But when one wooshes past me (on bike or run - say when they're doing a 2-loop olympic when I'm on a 1-loop sprint), I sometimes will yell out something like, ""wow!  way to go!"" - it IS impressive.  I can't see their faces at that point, so I have no idea how they respond... except for one guy today who waved his hand a bit."

I go into T1, grab my stuff and run to the tent, and then what? Can I leave right from the tent to go bike or do I have to go back to my spot in T1?  I'm just trying to get a feel for how long it will take me to do this whole thing."
triathlon,3dmj0a,lordrashmi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't done LP but this is how it works at every Ironman I have water. First, you won't actually have anything at your bike besides the bike. All your gear will be in two separate bags, a bike bag and a run bag. You will check these in the day before when you check in your bike (but can access them race morning as well).  You will run out of the water, run through all the bags laid out on the ground in order and grab yours. You then run to the change tent and do what you need to do and put all your stuff back in your bag. Hand the bag to a volunteer or drop it at the tent exit and run to your bike.  Looks like LP doesn't have a map of transition up but checkout the map for canada, specifically the part labeled ""Gear Bags"" in the lower left: http://www.ironman.com/~/media/59395569f4a2454286effea86adbf73e/2015%20ironman%20canada%20swim%20course%20web.pdf"

triathlon,3dmj0a,birddogguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:52:58 2015 UTC,You will also get 2 special needs bags: one for the bike and one for the run.  You can put anything you might want in the special needs bags and can access it about half way through the bike and run.  But whatever you don't use from the special needs bags gets thrown away.  You don't get those back like you do with your bike gear and run gear bags.  They're will be a lot more about this in your packet.
triathlon,3dmj0a,crm115,3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"Nudity is allowed in the changing tents at full Ironmans.  The no public nudity means you just have to wait to get into the tent before you start to strip.  This is only the case in full Ironmans, half Ironmans don't have changing tents which is why you haven't seen it before.  So you are correct that you will see a bunch of bare asses in the changing room.  There are also volunteers in the tent that are very attentive so try not to get weirded out when a dude comes up to you wearing rubber gloves asking if you need any assistance.

My T1 at IMCDA was 4 minutes and my T2 was 2 minutes and that included changing into bike shorts after the swim and changing into tri shorts for the run. I probably only added a minute since I had to head into the tent anyway to get my helmet, shoes, glasses, etc. out of my bag and then head to my bike. I never changed in my 70.3s, but 112 miles on a bike is a long way and the extra comfort of bike shorts is great."
triathlon,3dmj0a,freeze4576,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:16:04 2015 UTC,"Well it is highly recommended to get tri shorts or a one piece tri suit. I estimate it would cost you at least 5 minutes to get your bike shorts and find a tent and change even if that is allowed, versus zero for not changing."
triathlon,3dmj0a,kevinmcf,9,Fri Jul 17 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"For short course sure. For an ironman, the extra minute to change into proper bike shorts for a more comfortable ride is worth it for me."
triathlon,3dmj0a,crm115,5,Fri Jul 17 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The advice here does not apply to an Ironman.  In an Ironman you have to grab your transition bag and go through the changing tent.  Since you will be changing to get into your bike shoes anyway, the time penalty to put remove your speedo and put on bike shorts is 30 seconds at the absolute worst.  Unless you are expecting to podium, changing is absolutely worth it."

triathlon,3doafj,thergoat,4,Fri Jul 17 22:10:34 2015 UTC,"I followed this plan to start when I was 19 (last year, lol). I think it does a good job of putting in some tough work but also working up to the longer distances. I didn't always pay attention to the intervals, as I didn't start out with a HR monitor, so just take the time, and if it is a tough workout, run/bike hard. The best part about this plan is the multitude of swim workouts. I couldn't swim a full length a year and a half ago, and now I am looking at a sub-1:10 swim at IMLP this year.   Other advice, become a student of the sport and really learn it. Hopefully after a few months of training you will realize that you don't need an ""internet"" plan and will either start planning your weeks by yourself or if you have the money, get a coach. There are so many resources online.   Use Strava for the bike. Get a Garmin if you can for the run. Track the swim however you want. Set up an excel spreadsheet for your overall training log so that you can track what you want. If you want me to send you mine from last year so that you can get an idea of what that would look like, let me know.   Consistency beats big workouts every day, as does taking care of your body. In order to push your body during workouts you need to treat it like a baby all other times!   Most of all, good luck. A lot of people start this journey and end up settling for something smaller. If you can follow it through, you will be a different person. Not because you are an ""Ironman"" but because of all the training it took and the journeys you took by yourself and with others. 140.6 is the distance that defines this sport, but it's the 1000's of miles of training that define the people who do the sport."

Some come with laces that can be pulled and clipped already on them for a faster T2 but you can add these laces on any shoe really. Some also are much thinner, breathable material to drain water but unless it's raining your feet should be relatively dry by the run segment. In the end you get what works best for you. I've been using Mizuno for 10 years now (since high school track, not that old here) but have recently been looking into some on cloudracers because they have a smaller drop than my current shoes.

triathlon,3dkj4b,Lizabetanne,5,Fri Jul 17 00:34:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly the only time I don't need to breathe every stroke is during open water practice or in a pool. In the race when the water is churning with 50 other people beside me, I mostly breathe every stroke, only getting to every three when it thins out and my adrenaline calms down. I do make sure to alternate sides every ten strokes to balance my neck twisting (I like to feel even). Definitely no shame in frequent breathing!  One tip I read online that has helped me is to look up to the blue sky when breathing. It breaks up the murk for me which ultimately calms me down. I also direct my thoughts to counting strokes in different combinations because a busy brain has less room for the panic to seep in.  Sighting is also helpful so that you know there's a turn or an end coming soon.  Mostly practice is the best thing you can do though. The more you're in it, the more normal it becomes. If you have a wave start, I would make sure you get experience in a group.

Begin by lying on your back and floating for a little bit and focus on calm steady breathing, then rotate and float on your stomach with your head underwater and just breathe slowly. Do this so you don't have a sudden heart rate spike and you can keep control of your breathing, it's worth doing this the morning of your race as well. When you do start the race, just take your time and walk in to the water, keep your heart calm and that will make it easy to breathe.   When swimming start slow and just think about your breathing, pick a pace that seems very slow until your breathing calms down then you can start picking up the speed. Make sure you have a steady exhale underwater and you are not holding your breath.    Don't worry about the thing in the lake, he's only there Tuesday afternoons."
triathlon,3dkj4b,thefranster,2,Fri Jul 17 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"During a race you are surrounded by other athletes. You'll be following other feet and watching swimmers to the left and right. The Thing from Below is much scarier when you're swimming alone.  Breathing every stroke is perfectly normal in open water, even if you breathe 1in4 in the swimming pool.  Swim a bit before the start if you can (warming up.) I'm always a bit nervous at the start, and then there's people cajoling for room. It's much less stressful if your body is already used to the water temperature."

Aside from my 10 minute trial the day before the race- that was my only exposure. I found that after about 15 minutes I got over it. Everything about practice is true. It's a mental game- look around you, nobody is getting pulled in. I found that having people around was wildly assuring- so you can also bank on that."

I do this and it: a) distracts me from thoughts such as ""what's swimming below"" b) regulates my breathing (probably because of a))  You'll get used to it with practice.  On race day try to position yourself at the edge of the crowd--the outside edge if you're swimming a loop--so that you have enough space if you need it. Getting jostled in the crowd can add substantially to the stress."

triathlon,3dl0m6,pehrk,5,Fri Jul 17 03:10:57 2015 UTC,For $800 you should be able to find a decent used entry level bike and maybe some upgrades. You'll get the most bang for the buck buying something newer especially if you grab a triathlon bike used. Check around Craigslist or local shops for a deal. I would continue to save because you will likely end up spending an extra $200 on other items you need (pedals shoes aerobars etc). In the meantime clean your damn bike. You will probably need a new chain or just take it to a mechanic for a service. If you can't find or save enough for a newer  bike by your race that will do just fine. It's fun passing someone on an expensive bike using a bike like that.
triathlon,3dl0m6,TheBigBadOx,2,Fri Jul 17 03:38:05 2015 UTC,Agreed clean the bike and pass some dentists. Then if you like racing upgrade
triathlon,3dl0m6,fourcoffee,2,Fri Jul 17 11:21:22 2015 UTC,"800$ will give you a pretty decent bike. However, you might want to look into getting some other tri gear that will give you a speed boost (if you don't have it already), then you can decide if you want to buy a new bike later:   well fitted trisuit really helps aerodynamics. Your body provides most of the  air resistance, so that is the part to work on. Pedals and bike shoes specifically made for triathlon, so you can do a flying start. Bike shoes supposedly gives you a more efficient pedal stroke, but I have seen experiments with no noticeable difference. At the very least it  helps with sprinting, and keeps your foot in place. When I started using em I thought it was a significant upgrade. Vented aero helmet. Apparently, helmet choice is really important  https://youtu.be/_p8SdRRe1fo . Unfortunately its hard to know which one is  right for you without going to a windtunnel. So according to  bikeradar, the bontrager ballista is both really  aero (on their test setup) and cheap.   If you do end up wanting to upgrade your current bike, I think some clip on  aerobars and a new seat will do you good :), and they will likely run you about 200$."

I had to ride my bike with tennis shoes today on flat road and my feet came off several times because I am so used to also pulling up.   Also- definitely change that saddle, take the lock off, add 1 or 2 water bottle hostlers, and perhaps a saddle bag with equipment to change a tire after taking it to the bike shop for cleaning/maintenance."

Used is a good option (check craigslist, local bike exchange groups, eBay, local bike stores, etc). Your bike definitely needs service. Either look up some how to videos on basic bicycle maintenance or take it to your local bike shop and have them do a full overhaul. Probably a new chain, clean the cassette and chainrings, check bearings, etc. How is your fit on your bike?

triathlon,3dlbsc,chinesedoorbell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:00:13 2015 UTC,I seem to remember the optimal caffeine intake at around 200mg beforehand. If you're taking preworkout aim for somewhere around that number and do it in training to see how you go. Just remember that caffeine tolerance makes a difference and someone who loads up on caffeine everyday will notice less benefit than just taking it on raceday. FWIW I have around 200mg before training and find a massive difference in performance when I don't have it.

It was so much fun I did it a few more times :-)  The volunteer captain had done it for most of the history, and had great stories and insights.    For the most part, the finishers fall into three groups.  The early finishers are generally OK, usually just pissed off that they didn't hit their goal (lots of Type-A's in this group).   Didn't care so much to catch them, as they didn't want help and were just grumpy.   Helped if i told them I was their guide through the finish line area, then they accepted the help.  Next bunch through are those who raced hard, but either beyond their abilities, or had made some error on fueling/hydration or other strategy.  This is the group that needs the wheelchairs, and will lean on you heavily.  From this group, you learn all the interesting ways to get an IV for rehydration (best line ""I feel fine, but the world seems like its closing in on me..."").  Pukers are in this group too.  Last, are the ones that raced within their ability, executed properly, and are just giddy happy to have finished.  They are awesome.  I have also done an aid station on the run.

Definitely a wetsuit day, but if you haven't trained in the neoprene hat and booties, I wouldn't be overly concerned about adding them to your ensemble. Keep an eye on morning wind.  It can get choppy fast. Give yourself plenty of time to walk from transition to swim start.  It's not super close, and there were people running over when it came close to start time.   Bike   If you're used to riding Wisconsin back roads, it's really not that bumpy.  It's a pretty standard mix of anything you'll encounter here.  If you're not used to it, it may be bumpy. The last ~5 miles or so have some of the worst bumps (big cracks with elevation differences between slabs of concrete).  Be prepared to try to stay comfortable in the saddle so you don't throw off the run in the last 20 min. Just be aware of potholes.  If you're a slower rider, be careful moving left quickly to dodge them.  If you're a faster rider, be aware that people riding to your left may be suddenly coming over to avoid a crater.   Run   There is no scenic view of the zoo as advertised. Similar to the bike, don't expect much shade.  On the plus side, the community seems to come out with hoses and sprinklers for cooling."
triathlon,3dia6n,myekename,4,Thu Jul 16 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"That first turn on the swim happens almost immediately (~100yds).  Your entire wave will be trying to hit that corner tight which makes for the most jumbled swim experience I've ever had in a tri.  So position yourself accordingly - if you're a weak swimmer, stay back and to the left.  The only hill on the course is a short but steep one out of transition so leave your bike in a very easy gear in transition.  The course is incredibly boring.  There is nothing to look at except for small segments of the run near transition.  So prepare yourself to stay mentally strong.  The back half of the run course (once it move away from the shore) gets very congested if you're in a later wave.  I don't really have any advice here.  Just be prepared for it.  Downtown Racine is (I'm sorry if I offend any locals) a shithole not a terribly great place to spend an evening.

triathlon,3dfvnw,sharpfork,3,Thu Jul 16 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"Chlorine does bad things to wetsuits, though I'm not sure whether one or two practice swims would be enough to do any damage. You can always practice with a pull buoy instead to approximate a wetsuit's buoyancy."
triathlon,3dfvnw,not_a_big_fan_of_GOT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:39:17 2015 UTC,I was curious about this a few months back before my first tri of the season. I had purchased a wetsuit in the offseason and wasn't going to get a chance to try it our in the open water before. 2XU says on their website that prolonged exposure to chlorine is not covered. A swim to get acclimated would certainly not be considered 'prolonged'. Still be sure to rinse it off well after getting out of the pool.
triathlon,3dfvnw,Quarter103,2,Thu Jul 16 20:48:01 2015 UTC,"I would say the damage to your wetsuit from one quick pool swim, especially if you rinse it off right after, will be negligible.  Worth it to get a feel for swimming with one before race day."
triathlon,3dfvnw,TriHack,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"yes, never wear a wetsuit in a pool- you don't need it temperature wise- and the distance is never usually long enough to justify the time taken to get out it before you jump on the bike...."
triathlon,3dfvnw,n0luck13,2,Thu Jul 16 07:34:08 2015 UTC,Thanks isn't enough. I would never have though of any of that until it was way too late.
triathlon,3dfvnw,Frenchmasterflex,2,Thu Jul 16 02:01:32 2015 UTC,"Great post! I only swim in open water at the moment and I totally love it now. At first, not having walls or something to grab onto was a little nerve racking but a few swims in you quickly realise it's just perception. If you trained well it's just a matter of staying calm and going out."

triathlon,3dfvnw,FourteenThousand,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:34:49 2015 UTC,"Slipping it down to your waist before being in transition sounds like nudity to me! :P  As a complete newbie to the triathlon, do transition areas have private changing curtains or something?   I've swam in open water in lakes and the ocean plenty of times. But never as a part of a competition. I imagine the excess of other people around would make this much different.   Thanks for sharing this post. I don't currently have any real triathlon plans, but getting into doing triathlons is one of my longer term lifetime goals."
triathlon,3dfvnw,grandzooby,6,Thu Jul 16 01:53:03 2015 UTC,"I think only full-distance events tend to have gender-separate changing tents.  Also it's common to wear your race kit under your wetsuit, so as you strip it off, you're ready to go and don't have to put anything on.  Often it's hard to pull clothes on when you're wet.  The excess of people isn't that bad.  If it's something that might bother you, just start at the back of your wave where it's less crowded.  It will only cost you a few seconds.  Triathlons are fun and I recommend just getting out there and doing them!"

triathlon,3di4n4,drseamus,4,Thu Jul 16 13:36:09 2015 UTC,"A swim in bib shorts? Cycling bib shorts?! Ew. That would feel like wearing a full nappy coming out of the swim.  If you're doing a full change, you can wear a pair of speedos or trunks surely?"
triathlon,3di4n4,reopye_Fe,2,Thu Jul 16 13:45:22 2015 UTC,That is my current plan.  I figured i'd try swimming in bibs for the hell of it just to see how bad it is.
triathlon,3di4n4,reopye_Fe,6,Thu Jul 16 13:58:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, but I still don't understand why you wouldn't just wear proper swimming attire for the swim and then change into dry cycling bib shorts for the bike. The chamois on those bib shorts is going to fill with water and slow you down."
triathlon,3di4n4,reopye_Fe,-3,Thu Jul 16 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"Where do you think the wet bibs would slow me down, on the swim or the bike? I'm pretty sure you're wrong on both, but I'm curious."
triathlon,3di4n4,reopye_Fe,9,Thu Jul 16 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"I think you'll be slowed down by:   The bib shorts filling with water on the swim and causing drag, and possibly disrupting your kick. Trying to run through T1 with what constitutes a massive water diaper. The extra water weight on the bike.   The bib shorts will take forever to dry, which can cause complications when cycling and aggravate any chafing issues you might have. At the very least it'll be very uncomfortable for 112 miles.  Either wear a pair of tri-specific tri shorts for the swim and bike (designed to be quick drying and with a thinner chamois that doesn't get in the way while swimming) or wear clothing specific to the individual events."
triathlon,3di4n4,Pope_Troy_McClure_II,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:53:15 2015 UTC,"No additional drag inside a wetsuit, buoyancy is also unaffected.   I don't really kick much on the swim, just for stabilization, won't be an issue.   If I do get slowed down on the run but it's less than a full change, which is pretty guaranteed, then it's still a net gain.   Sitting on the pad will make the water squish out."
triathlon,3di4n4,moosejock,6,Thu Jul 16 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really kick much on the swim   ...what?  There's clearly very little I can say to convince you that swimming in cycling gear is probably a bad idea, but here is my parting advice in case anyone else reading this thread feels like doing the same thing as you. Feel free to ignore it.   If you're changing between the 3 events, wear the clothes best suited to the individual events. If you're not changing between the 3 events, invest in a good quality 1- or 2-piece tri-suit and practice using it for all 3 events individually."
triathlon,3di4n4,critercat,2,Thu Jul 16 15:10:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. Wearing cycling bibs to swim would be like wearing running shorts for the 112 mile ride. It makes no sense.
triathlon,3di4n4,five_year_plan,2,Thu Jul 16 17:11:02 2015 UTC,Tri bib shorts! https://www.desotosport.com/product/RTB1  I have a pair and love them!
triathlon,3di4n4,ConvertsToMetric,3,Thu Jul 16 15:55:28 2015 UTC,If you are taking the time to do a full change then you should just wear the best possible attire for the swim and then change into the best attire for the bike. Easy.
triathlon,3di4n4,pihb,2,Thu Jul 16 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"Guessing you are a guy, but regardless I will give my two cents worth (I am a woman). I did my full in bikini bottoms, sports bra and tri top under wetsuit. Then changed into bike shorts for the bike and tri shorts for the run. I only ever changed my bottoms. I have done all my 70.3s without changing anything and never had any issues but for 112 miles I wanted to be sure I was comfortable."

triathlon,3di4n4,TunaBoo,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Why full change after swim? My 1 piece tri suit works perfect on the bike, not sure I would gain anything in either place with the swim (and would clearly lose 2-3 mins changing)."
triathlon,3di4n4,TunaBoo,3,Thu Jul 16 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you fully grasp the difference between how long you're on the bike for IM.  2-3 minutes of changing to be more comfortable for 5+ hours on a bike is worth it to most people.  I'm glad you love your one piece, but it's sort of silly to suggest that there is no benefit to the added comfort in such a long race."
triathlon,3di4n4,TunaBoo,2,Thu Jul 16 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"I claim if you can't wear your one piece for 5 hours, you may want to shop around and find a better one ;)  (Maybe new saddle too)  I have nothing against a two piece either, better for potty breaks and for women with different tops vs bottoms..   but a full change is pretty newb if you can avoid it, why not?"

I enjoy my days more often after a swim in the morning and feel even better following it up with a run or bike (prefer trail running over cycling anyday).  I think people in general try to make endurance endeavors more poetic than they are, I attribute this to NBC's early coverage of Kona."

I know how selfish I am when I bring up the conversation with my SO and say...""Hey, I'd like to do another IM"" There's no doubting that but she also understands where im coming from.

I certainly enjoy feeling better, I've lost a lot of weight and built a lot of fitness.  Nothing crazy though, I haven't overcome a disease, or morbid obesity, or have had some terrible tragedy in my life.  I probably wouldn't make a good age-grouper feature for an inspirational IM video.  I just want to put myself on a path of being better than before, and to keep that graph's slope moving in the ""better"" direction.  I'm not competing against anyone else, just myself.  Oh, and just remembered this point, which may be unusual for some:  I do triathlon because it only involves ME.  Everything else in my life involves dealing with people, and I've chosen to keep triathlon as a solo activity.  I typically don't train with anyone else, I don't travel with anyone else, no coordination with others, and I don't socialize with other triathletes.  Weird?  Not for me, it's quite refreshing.  Is this holding me back? Maybe.  I could probably learn a few things from a community or club.  I'll probably get a coach one of these seasons, so that may change this mindset a little.  Do I consider myself a loner or anti-social? Not really, it's just how I've decided to shape this hobby for myself."

I probably wouldn't recommend slowing your stroke down b/c most people have a stroke rate on the slow side anyway from over-gliding.

triathlon,3ddein,gardinermatt,3,Wed Jul 15 11:54:34 2015 UTC,"Alright folks, story time. Mine isn't so much intense as it is a total fuck up on my end. While training for my first full I was on a recovery week so I decided to take my 45 min run though some of the trails near my work. I've run in there many times but I figured I'd go exploring a little bit on a new trail. I went out and was just following the trails and not really paying attention and before I knew it my watch was giving me the ""halfway point"" alarm. I turned back around and started heading back. Now a 45 minute run for me is anywhere from 5.5-6 miles depending on the day and it was ~1 mile to the beginning of the trail. I continue running and after 2.5 miles I started getting a little suspicious that I fucked up somewhere since I wasn't back to the main trail yet. I kept going just to be sure and in hopes to find a trail map but I didn't at that point. I turned around and found a ""Y"" in the trail so I figured this must have been what I missed and just went down the other trail assuming it was correct. This was apparently also wrong because after another 1 mile or so I found a trail map and discovered that I had managed to circle around a small lake without realizing it and would have to circle all the way back around (another 4 miles).... or.... I could try to cut through this little area that seemed to cut across to the trail. There was no trail but the map legend did not show any water so I figured ""why not"". Now, if you learn something today from me let it be this. If there is a wide open space on the map legend with no trails (and no water) then there is probably a reason for that. I finally get to the area and discover that it is basically a swamp with tall grass and muck. Some may run through it but in NC in the heat of summer I'm not fucking with snakes and whatever else is lurking in there. So, here I am at a loss of what to do so I start running along the marsh in the general direction of the trail (worst part is that I could see the damn trail right there). Luckily I found a narrow section that was dryer and shorter grass so I took advantage. I got back on the main trail and made my way back to where I started and after 11 miles I was finally back.    Luckily I was ~2/3 of the way through the training program so I had built up some pretty good endurance and I was a runner before hand so this didn't kill me too much but needless to say I took the next morning session off. The worst part is that since I was expecting a short session I took no nutrition with me and I like to simulate race day sometimes so I didn't take my phone with me so no GPS. Funny thing I discovered this weekend (after getting lost running in Berlin this last weekend) is that my Garmin 310XT has a feature that will direct you back to where you started. Would have been really nice to know at the time. I hope you all enjoy the story about my idiocracy and learn some valuable lessons about how exploring and not paying attention don't mix well."

If your just out there to complete in a reasonable time then you should be ok to recover in time. I'm usually back to normal after about a week after a half. I personally would like to have the one on July 2nd as a tune up since it is a little closer to the full and maybe go a little closer to race pace to simulate nutrition and strategy.
triathlon,3ddz7h,dabear04,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on using them as 'tune up races' mainly.  If I'd enter the one on July the 2nd, then a PR would be in mind. Both courses are quite fast with flat bike courses and ditto running, so a new record should be possible."

When I am hungry, I eat peanuts - all kinds of them.   The key to my diet is tons of vegetables. This is the only way I can function properly. Besides that, every day I take vitamins and fish oil.

triathlon,3dcwva,hoges,2,Wed Jul 15 11:06:00 2015 UTC,"I think diets are so subjective to the person the their intensity of training.     For years I tried to follow a strict diet intake of calories intake to maintain energy and weight.  However, I alway found myself tired and taking naps before I went for run/ride/swim.    This year I tried something a little different.  I followed more of a paleo diet, but I wasn't strict about it.  I ate eggs and bacon even morning knowing I needed fat to loose fat and to sustain energy.  I cut all grains, but raised my veggie intake to make sure I took in enough carbs.   Lunch and dinner I eat half a chicken breast with my veggies.  Snacks were 4% Greek plain yogurt with a table spoon of local organic honey, nuts, nuts, and nuts, A banana and a grapefruit.    I never paid attention to my caloric intake, just what my belly told me and ate until I was content.  Of course I had cheat days!  So far following this lifestyle I have lost 15 pounds, ran a 30 minute marathon PR (3:18) had my best international tri race every, I ride 60-70 miles at a 23 mph average, and I never feel the need to take naps.  Last year was just the opposite when I was trying to follow diets I found online or what people suggested.    So I guess what am trying to say is, there is no need to follow someone's diet.  Just eat what your body needs, make sure it is clean and eat until you're content.  Your body will do the rest."

triathlon,3d9ah8,critercat,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"This is something I've been thinking about for a few months now. Here are all of the things I consider:   $$$ - Usually you pay for what you get, but you need to feel comfortable with the cost. Less money equals less interaction. USAT has three levels of coaching. To become a level 1 coach it just takes a long weekend at a USAT seminar (from what I remember a few years back). Level 2 requires experience and additional credentials and Level 3 even more so. But again, higher level of coaching usually equal more cost. Do you need more focus on swimming, cycling, or running? Make sure your coach has credentials in those individual sports as well. Were they (or are they still) a high level athlete themselves? As you said, you're not looking just to finish, you're looking to be competitive. Your coach doesn't necessarily need to have that experience, but it sure can help. Do they have any additional credentials, such as being a registered dietician/nutritionist?   I would choose 2-3 people that you think would be a good fit for you and set up an interview. Remember, you are hiring them. Ask them about their coaching philosophy, experiences with other athletes, etc. The interaction of coach/athlete personalities can be the difference between success and failure. At the end you want to be confidant with your decision."

triathlon,3d9ah8,shmenosity,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"Do you guys have any recommendations about how to find a good coach?   Depends on your needs; for example, personal interaction precludes a long distance coaching relationship. Or, real life school/work prevents a strict relationship with a taskmaster type approach to coaching.  Depends on your finances. If you only have $150 in the monthly budget then there's no point at looking at detailed nutrition plans with frequent one on one sessions since it probably won't happen.  Once you have a general idea what you want, use Google and word of mouth to see what's out there. If you have personal relationships that will allow for a frank discussion, talk to the athletes on local teams to see what they get from their coaching relationships, and what they like and dislike.  Example for me: I train alone, and like it that way. I don't need motivation from a coach and readily supply my own. I knew I didn't want to spend more than $125/month or so. I did some looking around and found out that a college acquaintance with an advanced degree in sports medicine and USAT certification was coaching. He offered me a good intro rate in my budget. Our relationship allows me to continue directing my needs, which I like: I can say say ""Hey, I'd like to do more hill work for that next race,"" or ask questions like ""Longer term, what can we do to get me ready for a hot-weather IM next season?"" What some might view as a downside, which I don't mind, is that I'm on my own for things like personal swim instruction and it's on me to seek out clinics or personal lessons."
triathlon,3d9ah8,Suckat3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"It really does depend on what you need exactly, worth joining a club, in the UK coaches can be level 1,2 or 3 and most 3s will be happy to take you on as a personal training type thing although don't expect to get it for free!  If you are elsewhere I'm sure it will be the same. If you can't find a coach find someone who is really into all aspects of the sport and ask to train with them :)"
triathlon,3d9ah8,ejm2610,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"The first thing to consider is what you need/want the coach to do?  This begins to set your expectations and can help drive both who you select and what to expect. For instance, do you simply want the accountability, oversight, guidance and structure from the coach?   Or do you want weekly conversation, in-person or Video analysis, detailed nutrition planes, etc.  then that is something else.   Going about finding a good coach takes a couple of steps. First ask your local triathlon friends who they use.  Second, ask your local bike shop if the can recommend a few.  Lastly, you can search on training Peaks for coaches in your area.    Local vs on-line doesn't make much difference if they are good.  The downside to remote coaching is that you don't get that in-person meetings.  But with technology, a lot of that can be resolved.    The key is to interview a few coaches before making a decision.   It amazes me how little this actually occurs.  Key questions to ask:  --how long have you been coaching --what motivated you to become a coach --how many clients do you coach? How many is too many for you? --do you have a business/coaching mentor? --what other coaches influence your style? --whats the greatest book/conference you have read/attended that influenced you as a coach? --what do you do to keep up with trends, research and changes in the sport? --do you compete at a high level? (I am curious where coaching ranks in their priority list)  These are tough questions.  Your typical hobby coach who just wants to make some money will struggle with these.  Your established, knowledgeable coach will have sound answers to all these.    Source:  I am a full-time tri coach."
triathlon,3d9ah8,BucknChange,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I prefer finding coaches in my local area.  Once that is done, the best way is to meet them.  See if their coaching styles align with your goals.  Do you need to be pushed?  Do you need nutritional tips?  Different coaches will have different expertise and different styles.  It's always been easier for me to understand who they are as a coach with a face to face meeting."

triathlon,3d9dv3,twosplits,5,Tue Jul 14 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right, but a big question would be, is what is your run pace? Once you start to get over the 2:30 time (7:30/mile for 20 miles) for a long run you're starting to potentially hurt your other workouts during the week due to giving so much to your long run.  The Hanson-Brooks elite marathoning team doesn't go over 16 miles for the most part in their marathon build up (they do go up to the 22-24 a few times but it's not the standard 20 miler/week you see many elite marathoners do). To compensate they do run more miles throughout the week and the theory is that they are doing the 16 miles on such tired legs that it's the equivalent to running the last 16 of a marathon."
triathlon,3d9dv3,Pope_Troy_McClure_II,3,Tue Jul 14 15:10:36 2015 UTC,When I go on long runs like that I stay in Zone 3 and I hover between 10:30-11:00 min/mile. Shorter stuff is faster for me.
triathlon,3d9dv3,Pope_Troy_McClure_II,5,Tue Jul 14 15:56:30 2015 UTC,Then I would consider staying around 16 miles for the majority of your block with one or two build ups to 20-22 range. 16 miles at 10min/mile pace is 2:40.
triathlon,3d9dv3,hoges,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:02:30 2015 UTC,23 miles at 11 min a mile has you out there for over 4 hours! That's a huge amount of time on feet and recovery you're going to need. Without meaning to be rude if your long run pace is 11min/mile your more than likely going to be walking a large portion of you IM marathon anyway. Keep it shorter with a slightly higher intensity and gauge how you recover from some 15 mil runs. I see no benefit in a 4+ hour death march physically or mentally.

triathlon,3d9dv3,HL87,-5,Sat Jul 18 06:25:59 2015 UTC,Running more than 90 minutes in training you are unlikely to see any benefit. Realistically you will be doing more damage to your body than you need to resulting in a higher chance of picking up injury.
triathlon,3d9dv3,Pope_Troy_McClure_II,7,Tue Jul 14 16:09:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with that. At 90 minutes is where you start to get the affects of long runs, but stopping at 90 minutes is too short. Even at 6min/mile pace you're not preparing your body for the pounding of a marathon on pavement with just 90 minutes.  2-2.5 hours really is the recommended time. Jack Daniels (running coach) structures his weekly long runs for his top marathoners at 20 miles or 2.5 hours, whichever comes first. Even for his 5/10k training, it's still 2hrs for a long run."
triathlon,3d9dv3,freeze4576,3,Tue Jul 14 16:24:41 2015 UTC,Well that's just absurd. At 8 min/mi this would mean you don't even run half the distance of the race before doing it. Running longer absolutely does improve your running endurance.
triathlon,3d9dv3,Suckat3,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"8:00 pace for 90 minutes = 11.25 miles. So, that's running a marathon with having only covered 43% of the distance in training. After the swim/bike. Curious to see the thinking of /u/HL87 behind this, but at first glance I agree that it's a bit off."
triathlon,3d9dv3,BucknChange,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"There is no debate that running farther/longer will add to your endurance.  But it all comes at a cost...recovery.  There are some theories out there that you shouldn't run more than 90'.  The key here is frequency and volume.  As referenced, top programs limit the long run.   It is all highly individual. To the OP, no way i would have you running 50 mpw at that pace.  That's nearly 10 hours of running a week.  When are you swimming and biking?   That is overkill for your level."
triathlon,3d8pdg,DPTFit,3,Tue Jul 14 11:13:21 2015 UTC,"That's a lot to try for one year. I was trying to think of a way to get it all to work together, but that 3 months off to lift make it tough.  It comes down to needing to prioritize your races. List all of your desired races for the next year in chronological order and choose 1-2 A races, a few B races, and the rest C races.   Here is how I would do it if I were you (Note: I live in FL so our running season is different than most places in the US). I'm not listing any 'C' races because they are really just fun, training events. Throw them in where it makes sense.  February to April:  Focus- base building, mostly run focused  March - 10k - 'B' Race  April - Half marathon - 'A' Race  Take an easy week off and then on to the next cycle.  May to August:  Focus- Triathlon training, more focus to swim/bike, run is strength oriented (tempos, keeping in a ~10 mile long run).  July - Sprint triathlon - 'B' Race  August - Olympic triathlon - 'A' Race  Take an easy week off and then on to the next cycle.  September to November:  Focus - Speed oriented running. Fast intervals.  October - 10k - 'B' Race  November - 5k - 'A' Race  This still doesn't give you 3 whole months to dedicate to lifting, but it's realistically the only way to meld all of these together. Hope this helps."
triathlon,3d8pdg,Pope_Troy_McClure_II,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:30:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I am sometimes I bit rigid and overly structured in life. Maybe I should not try to hit each type of race every year and rather vary it year after year. Maybe keep a tri (or even aquabike, never done one or a duathlon) to maintain each discipline year round, but can maintain running fitness with halfs, down to 5Ks and don't have to attempt to peak numerous times. I really like your template and have saved it. If I was to take out some of the races from my yearly plan I can shorten this down, allowing for a few extra months either weight training or just more ""off-season"" conditioning.  Also I live in Florida, so super applicable to me. Random question, do you swim in a full wetsuit still? I don't have a wetsuit and debating which style to get, if any."
triathlon,3d8pdg,Pope_Troy_McClure_II,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:06:44 2015 UTC,The general rule of thumb is to wear a wetsuit when it's legal to do so. You're able to swim faster and are safer with the neoprene's buoyancy.  You'll be able to wear one in most March/April races and maybe then again in October/November depending on where you are at in the state.
triathlon,3d8pdg,dabear04,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:29 2015 UTC,Weight lifting isn't necessarily a bad thing for tri as long as you do it properly. Obviously if you can be lean and strong without the extra 20 lbs of muscle then you will be faster. You've already discovered that you can still be fast in the shorter runs while training for the longer ones but unfortunately it is damn near impossible to be your very best at all of them at the same time. Luckily all the ones you mentioned are similar distances so you can be close to best compared to if you were shooting for 5K PR and a HIM.   My only additional advice from personal experience is to continue to cross train strength and high intensity workouts if you plan on competing in mud runs. I used to be all in on them and decided to do my first HIM and my performance in mud runs took a huge hit. I had better endurance overall but without the heavy lifting and properly training the fast twitch muscles I was slower overall and took longer to recover after each race.
triathlon,3d8pdg,FrickinFracker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:19:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I agree, resistance training in general is very beneficial for any endurance athlete.

triathlon,3d7ad9,MOAB1,8,Tue Jul 14 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"Can't comment on the training alone since I only train with others about 1-2% of the time.  As for the bike, live up to it. Get on that thing and ride the shit out of it. Rack up miles, turn those cranks, and enjoy becoming the kind of triathlete who's ""worthy"" (whatever that means in your head) of having that steed."
triathlon,3d7ad9,Suckat3,5,Tue Jul 14 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"Well first of all 19.6mph is a fairly impressive bike speed for an oly on a road bike, even in the hardest age groups (youngish male). But anyway the slower you are the more you benefit from aerodynamics."
triathlon,3d7ad9,freeze4576,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"I know what you're trying to say (slow riders ride longer, so any help will help them for a longer period), but it's not true that aerodynamics are more beneficial for longer times at slower speeds compared to shorter times at faster speeds. Wind resistance increases exponentially with speed (so riding twice as fast can result in 3-4x the resistance)."
triathlon,3d7ad9,Bamboo_Fighter,4,Wed Jul 15 02:30:25 2015 UTC,That's why you got the bike man! to go faster!   Wait till you sit on it and blow your previous speed to dust and how happy you are for getting it.   I'm in my first year and every time I sit on my bike I'm happy I got that one instead of cheeping out. At least on this one I have room to grow.
triathlon,3d7ad9,Frenchmasterflex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:21:45 2015 UTC,Same here! Having a nice bike (though mine is comparatively cheap) makes me feel like I have to push myself harder to avoid looking like the slow guy who bought the fast bike.

There's a difference between being the guy who wants to get faster, buys the right bike and works hard, and the guy who buys the bike but is all bravado and no work. If you put in the work, you can be confident in that. Besides, there will always be someone faster who you're intimidated to train with.  When that bike gets there, enjoy it. You deserve it."

He was riding in the aerobars and not leaving near enough room to hit the brakes is something were to happen."
triathlon,3d7ad9,boobooaboo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:14:43 2015 UTC,"I understand how not leaving room would be an issue, but what's wrong with using the aerobars? Isn't that good practice?"
triathlon,3d7ad9,missmichellepole,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:54 2015 UTC,"It's great practice - by yourself. Can you brake from the aerobars? If you can, go for it. (As far as I know, this feature doesn't exist). Plus, if you do wreck, those bars are going to absolutely mangle someone - worse than a normal roadie.   In group rides, there are often a lot of surges and stops or slowdowns for road furniture. So ride on the tops so you can brake. But unless you have Di2 and can shift from the tops, you aren't going to have fun trying to mash big gears when you slow down for furniture and have to catch back up.   Tl;dr,  aerobars are dangerous in groups. use road bikes."
triathlon,3d7ad9,boobooaboo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:44:47 2015 UTC,Yep! Already participate in the occasional group ride and I'm aware of this rule. Isn't it also the rationale behind draft legal and nondraft legal racing?

triathlon,3d7j8s,cookmybook,7,Tue Jul 14 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"I hope you've trained for that last 0.3. It's a doozie.   Anyway, I would cut the intensity immediately. I would do zone 2 bikes & runs 3x this week and cut one maybe two of them out for next week. Still swimming a regular schedule but without intensity.   Maybe 1 to 2hr bikes with 30 min runs after during the week and just a bit longer this weekend. Again, not over zone 2.   I have no credibility to offer you as a coach or anything, but there's my opinion. Good luck in lake placid. I'll be there visiting family on Friday and hope to swim the course."
triathlon,3d7j8s,bankofreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:38 2015 UTC,This seems correct to me. You're not going to gain anything in fitness over the two weeks. Keep everything at an easy and aerobic pace.
triathlon,3d7j8s,gardinermatt,3,Tue Jul 14 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"Hay's in the barn for fitness, so no worries about trying to gain more.  Since your swim technique could use work, this is a great time to focus on that.  And while this will be confusing since it runs directly counter to what /u/bankofreddit suggests, I up my intensity, maintain frequency, and slightly reduce volume. This comes in the form of easier zone 2 workouts with short high intensity intervals thrown in, more frequently that at other phases of training. No point in base training relative to gains that won't matter in a race 2 weeks out. YMMV, do as you feel is best or your coach or favorite book recommends, etc etc.  Where I'm coming from (included because context of a poster informs the post): 70.3 athlete, 5:09 PB, coached.   Have fun, and good luck!"

Might be worth checking.   Keep your head up :). Sure its a bummer but we all get a mechanical failure once in a while. Next time you'll be out and prepared again.

triathlon,3d4ge9,CambridgeRunner,10,Mon Jul 13 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"I've fixed a lot of flats in my day.   Get a pair of latex (or alt if you're allergic) gloves and run your hand along the length of the inside of your tire.  Did it catch?  If not run your hand back along the length of your tire, but in the opposite direction?  Did the glove catch on anything?  If not your tire is probably fine.  Anything that would puncture an innertube would catch on a latex glove.    Take a look at your tire.  Are there any spots where it's worn through?  I had a series of flats one race and it was driving me insane until I realised I had gone threadbare and no rubber was protecting my innertube.   With the latex glove, run your hand on the inside edges of your rim in both directions.  If you still haven't found anything look at your rim tape.  Does it still cover all your spoke holes?  Run your glove along it, any catches?    If you're still looking for what's causing your flats, take a look at where the spoke nipples connect to the spokes.  Do you have any noticeable rim damage (cracks, pulled through spokes)?  Are any of your spokes loose?  At this point, if you've done these things, they've all been negative and you're still getting flats, I suggest burning the rim in a ceremonial fire, and buying a new rim.  Note, I say gloves because I always have a pair in my seat bag and I'd rather rip them up than rip up my hands.  As a bonus, if I have a mechanical and have to wipe my nose, I don't look like cycling Hitler."

Interesting thing I discovered was that the first flat (I kept the tube), was on a seal near the valve.    The second flat was an actual puncture/gash (about 3mm) on the other side from the valve.  So it was definitely two different areas that gave trouble.    I don't know if that's good or bad.    P.S.  Your ceremonial fire made me laugh out loud in the middle of the price club.

triathlon,3d4ge9,OnlyFactsNoContext,4,Fri Jul 17 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"Also, practice your flat changing!  Just keep changing tire + tube over and over till you can do it in 2-3 minutes. In a real race, you would be DQed for having someone help change your tire.  Not a big deal for your first race, but it's a good skill to learn.  (Actually can help your safety on long training rides in no-mans land, as getting a flat 20 miles away from a gas station with no cell signal and unable to change flats is bad)"

triathlon,3d59kw,n0luck13,4,Mon Jul 13 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"You have a chicken/egg conundrum, with the silver lining that there's a clearer answer here.  You could get by doing the stationary or spin bike for a while if you knew how to replicate the feel of 1) a properly sized road bike and 2) that bike's approximate resistance on the road. You can't really get there without doing the bike first, and even then there would be quite a few caveats to training this way.  My best advice: Take the leap, get a bike. Do it cheaply by grabbing an old used one off of craigslist for $100-200. Go to a local shop to see if they'll give you the basics of how to ride. On the off chance you happen to be 5'8"" or taller, located in MA, and willing to pick it up, I have an old steel 10 speed and a trainer you could have. Rear wheel on the bike needs to be trued, and the resistance dial on the trainer is broken (I used a pliers to adjust it until replacing it). This was the steel horse that got my through my first triathlon. Yours for the taking."

triathlon,3d59kw,aePrime,4,Mon Jul 13 22:38:58 2015 UTC,"I dislike stationary bikes. They're often not sized correctly, have the wrong geometry, and are seemingly not made for cyclists at all. Most triathletes put their bikes on trainers or rollers if they're going to be indoors, but this is obviously not an option for you at the moment.  What I recommend you do is to try a spin class. The bikes are usually better, the class is more entertaining than watching some muted talk show in the gym, and if you have a good instructor, you'll get a really good workout."
triathlon,3d59kw,fuerzadcon,2,Mon Jul 13 18:47:41 2015 UTC,I used a spin bike at the gym (on my own not in a class) throughout the winter before I bought my first road bike in the spring.   How much a training plan will demand for you depends on what distance race you are training for. Before I did my first sprint the longest I ever road a bike for was one hour.

(If you haven't ever ridden a bike, like running and swimming it is a skill that you must learn then practice.)  If money isn't an issue, it would be a good idea to get a bike fitting before you purchase your bike. It will help you buy the right size and then fit it afterwards. I am a huge fan of having your fitting done by someone who isn't trying to sell you anything (mine was done by a physical therapist).  If money is an issue, i would recommend that you take a spin class or two. Before the class starts the instructor will generally ask if anyone needs help setting up their bike...accept this.  If after the class, the bike feels reasonably good. Measure distance from the middle where the pedal arm (crank) goes into the bike (bottom bracket) and the bottom of the seat.  Subtract 4-5 cm... and this will be a reasonable starting point for bike size.  *The measure from the center of the bottom bracket to the top tube (the tube that is between your legs) is referred to the stack... this is the first measurement that you look at in fitting a bike. *   The other is the reach which is how far away the handlebars are from the bottom bracket   see stack and reach primerfor more info  edit-- formatting"

With times like that you would be finishing near the top of most sprint events in all likelihood.  Do you have any idea what the average age of people in the 1sts and 2nds teams is? I doubt there are any freshers at all, unless they are triathlon prodigies. You may find some cross-country runners or established swimmers who can hit one of those times, but achieving both is a tall order.  What university is it out of interest?"

triathlon,3d4atv,_uksz,3,Mon Jul 13 12:17:16 2015 UTC,Clincher. 100%.   I have tubular race wheels and while they ride and handle fantastic changing the tubes is just a serious pain. A clincher with good tires (Continental GP4000 or attack/force) and latex tubes are going to be just as fast and handle / ride very close to tubulars.  And if you have a flat you can just change the tube and be back on the road.  If you race IM or HIM distance you will want to carry a spare and a spare tubular is HUGE.
triathlon,3d4atv,lordrashmi,3,Mon Jul 13 13:29:48 2015 UTC,Clincher is the way to go if you want to be self sufficient. In many cases most athletes have to be their own mechanic especially out on long rides. Nowadays I think the advantage of tubular tires compared to clinchers is very minimal.

triathlon,3d5rr3,red_steel,4,Mon Jul 13 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"Practice it before race day! On my long days and race day I eat a full meal 3 hours before (much to my fiance's chagrin as I get up at 4am to eat and then go back to bed). The night before I soak steel cut oats with a little milk and a hand full of frozen berries, plus banana and peanut butter on a tortilla.    Sip water until race starts.  20-30 minutes before take 1 gel.  T1 - quick gel, or sip from multi-hour bottle Bike - 1 bottle water/hour  + 2 servings Perpetuem (multi-hour bottle) + 2-3 gels. More from an aid station if I feel like I need it.  Run - gel every 30-40 minutes, water from every aid station   As you're pretty close only use what has worked for you in training. Stick with what you know and practice it before race day."
triathlon,3d5rr3,moosejock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"Edit: Intended as a new reply to OP and not a response to /u/moosejock.  It took me months to crack the code on what works for me, especially around the run. Taking my advice probably has about a 20% likelihood of working for you, so buyer beware.   1) What are good things to eat during the triathlon   For me, Heed, Gu, and Gu Chomps. Flat Coke or Red Bull during the run. Although I've left the chomps by the wayside this season since it's hard to breath, stuff my face, and chew while on the bike.  What didn't work for me was Gatorade, Powerade, and Clif Bars. I'll still use these before or after long training sessions, but not during.  The best triathlete I know (AG qualified for both Kona and Worlds last year) swears by potatoes on the bike.   2) When do you like to eat (transitions? on the bike?)   Gu 15 minutes before the swim. On the bike. During the run. In a triathlon, I don't do anything standing still that can be done while moving, so no eating in transition. Eating a gel in 15 seconds in transition when I can do it while running is like getting free speed that I don't have to train for. So why leave it on the table?  3) Does anyone eat pre-race if the race starts 7am?  Definitely! In the past I've done solid foods that I knew were fine. This season I'm experimenting with sticking with liquids. About 3 hours before the race, I'll wake up and have a cup of coffee to get my nervous gurr on, followed by 2x Ensure Actives, a banana, and a sugar free Red Bull. Maybe a Clif Bar if I'm still hungry, and then drink to thirst leading up to the race."
triathlon,3d5rr3,Suckat3,3,Mon Jul 13 20:45:39 2015 UTC,In my experience if you ask 20 people this question you will get 20 different answers and that it because you have to find out what works best for you. What works for me might have you shitting in the woods half way through the bike.  But here is what I do... 1. Eat/drink what you train with. For a 70.3 you should be doing training rides that test your nutrition plan for race day. For the most part I try to train with what is on the course for the race. My nutrition during race consists on Gatorade Endurance and AccelGel.  2. On the bike I get in 250-300 calories per hour. I have an AccelGel every half hour and hydrate with about 20-24 ounces of water and Gatorade Endurance every hour (throughout the hour). On the run i take water and an electrolyte drink at every aid station and gu or chews about every 4 miles.  3. Pre race I always eat some form of breakfast. Usually a bagel with peanut butter or oatmeal and definitely coffee. Pre race while at the race site I stay hydrated by sipping on Nuun and then eat a Cliff bar about 20-30 minutes before start time.   It is important to have a plan! Good luck!

triathlon,3d4c3v,syklenaut,3,Mon Jul 13 12:44:43 2015 UTC,"What do you consider ""somewhat affordable""?  There are various left leg only options but I'm recommending my friend try the Powertap C1 when they are released (later this month I believe).  Reasons:    Dual leg Established, reputable company Affordable(ish) at $799 if you have compatible chain rings already. If not you have to add that into the cost.   If you want just left leg power you can get down to $399 I believe. As /u/syklenaut  said, DC Rainmaker is your friend...  And yes, anything ant+ will work with your 920xt. The only thing I'd avoid is Rotor Power meters. They are Ant+ but mine works rather poorly with my 910 and 920. Great with my 510 though."

The problem with that is that there's not a tonne of science on what those power results will mean.  Cycleops was one of the first to do power, with the power tap.  There's currently a tonne of these available for cheap because people who train with power want Vector pedals as they think L/R power is cool.  There's also the issue of whether or not you need power, and whether $500-2000 would be better spent on a coach, wheels, gruppo, etc."

triathlon,3d2cpj,missmichellepole,2,Mon Jul 13 13:24:59 2015 UTC,"Look up Kiefer's safer swimmer. It's a little orange buoy you strap around your waist. I wear that and then swim with my dad who also trains for open water races and we go about 30 feet out from shore and then follow the shoreline along the lake. The buoy is for boat visibility, not for floating.  I do a minimum of ten open water swims before any race, going about 1/2 race distance up to the full deal. The reason I insist on open water swimming, and doing so in a way such as following the shoreline instead of going between docks (a better plan than not getting in a lake at all though!) is because in a pool you have walls to rest on. Even just doing a turn is giving you a little break from the stroke. That's a big piece to get used to, and why many college swimmers struggle with open water swimming and triathlon swims.   The other reason I insist on so many open water practices is because pools don't have waves- lakes do. So what is a normal breath in a pool may get you a face full of water in a lake. The strategy for this is that I don't let out all of my air before a breath in open water, so if I need to go two more strokes before a good breath, I can. The other wave factor is with your pull. In a pool, you're just focusing on moving forward. In a lake, you're also stabilizing yourself and hurdling over the waves. All of this doesn't so much need formal teaching (in my experience) but just getting out there a few times and working it out yourself.  PS I'm located in the Cities, message me if you want to get together for a practice or want more advice!!"

My advice? Skip the coaching for now and join a few local triathlon clubs. There are countless Full Ironman training programs online that you can use as a guide, and any tri club will be full of established athletes that will be more than happy to lend a hand, free of charge (as long as you buy them a drink in the post-ride pub trip)."

triathlon,3d1u70,chipsbk,3,Sun Jul 12 21:01:31 2015 UTC,Hey there I did the NYC Tri last year! It's a great race.   The swim is super easy. They say if you put a basket of chips in at start it'll float to the swim exit in 30 minutes.   I swim a 1500m swim in ~24-25 minutes in a pool. In OWS it's around 28 minutes. I knew the swim would be easy so swam relatively easy to save some energy for the rest of the race. I swam it in ~18min. So expect to be around 20min. Of course YMMV.   Any other questions feel free to ask!  PS: Try not to drink the water... It's also got a slight tinge of saltiness :p
triathlon,3d1u70,heelflipp900,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:38:33 2015 UTC,Thank you SO much! I will definitely do my best to stay away from drinking the hudson - HA!   I actually do have another question in regards to the Tri-Suit. I just purchased one to wear on Sunday. Are these mandatory for each component of the race? Would it be possible to wear it for the swim and then put on another shirt for the bike and the run?   Thanks again for your help!
triathlon,3d1u70,heelflipp900,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"No problem!  That's fine. I'm not sure why you want to, but you can throw another shirt on top of whatever you're wearing for the swim. There were a few people I saw threw on a tech shirt over their tri suit. If you're worried about being cold, you usually dry pretty quickly on the bike after the swim due to the wind.   If you're talking about completely changing, as in taking off your tri-suit top and throwing a shirt (biking jersey?) on that's cool too. It will probably take a decent amount of time though. Of course common modesty should be taken into account.  Another hint: Take the beginning of the bike slowly. Getting out of the park and onto the highway is tough with a nice hill right out of the gate along with some technical turns."

triathlon,3d0wll,oscaralphakilo,2,Sun Jul 12 21:49:00 2015 UTC,"Wetsuits are better than not having one, the buoyancy will mean you spend less effort swimming. They are also better at cutting through the water than your skin/hair which will save effort.  It's better to have the clip-in cycle shoes/pedals than just have running shoes, although if you have a hybrid/mountain bike and not a road bike I would just use running trainers.

Flight: Use google to search for flights, but budget for maybe $300 roundtrip(?).  Car: If renting a car, budget around $300 for the week by the time you put gas in it.

Its not going to hurt your fitness at this point and you can use the time to get ahead on sleep and eat some recovery food. Race day is the easiest part of the IM journey.

triathlon,3cyw6k,dabear04,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:40:33 2015 UTC,"Do you do any cross training? I agree with /u/dabear04 that you may need a day off. If you already have rest days scheduled/planned, I strongly recommend cross training of some sort once per week. In triathlon, I think we get so focused on our three sports and think that those three are close enough to a cross train that we're okay, but we forget about the mental side that we also need to train. For myself, I do dance classes- I still get a workout and cardio, but I can let loose and lose myself in a completely different way.   If dance isn't your deal, I also recommend yoga, weight lifting, group fitness classes, extra long walk with the dog- anything that keeps you active but gives you a mental break from training!!   Also, meditation can be great. I believe there is a sub for it here, otherwise youtube can be a decent resource if you screen them first.  I find when I'm training for a tri or dance or anything, I get so stressed and nervous that I lose sight of why I'm doing it--- not to win the whole race, but because I love it! Meditation helps me to refocus on that.   I hope some of these things work for you, I'm sure you'll be awesome!!"

I'd rather spend time not running, biking and swimming with family and friends.  2)  10-12 hours a week is a lot.  Adding more for the sake of doing weights seems like an invitation for injury.  It's far more difficult to injure yourself doing bodyweight workouts, like running, plyos, biking and swimming.  3)  I chose this sport to be outside in the summers.  Taking sunlight hours and burning them at the gym seems like a way to start hating triathlons in my opinion.  That being said, I swim and lift in the winter, and ride a lot less."
triathlon,3csxkp,OnlyFactsNoContext,2,Fri Jul 10 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Good points, for sure. And, triathlon typically carries less chance of injury than either of the three sports on their own simply because the same amount of time is shared between all three, rather than say 10-12 hours just running.   I would counter that weight training or resistance training really need not be that much of a time commitment though, and that the return on investment is worth it to prevent or manage certain injuries like swimmer's shoulder or runner's knee.  I am confident you see that side of it and are more than aware of the benefits of a strength training routine, but am simply putting it out there for everyone. After falling and separating my shoulder last December skiing, I really wish I had put some more time into strengthening that joint if only to avoid the ""what if..?"" over the following months!"
triathlon,3csxkp,Ceceilo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:12:57 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree, I totally feel you with the sentiment of not wanting to be indoors when the sun is shining, but I am finding I can do less volume especially with rides and runs and get better performances by implementing strength work. I used to do workouts like 3 x 20 reps of the usual things; now I do 3 x 4-6 reps notice much better results for less time."
triathlon,3csxkp,kerrynq,3,Sat Jul 11 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"I want to start strength training. Especially as a woman, strength training is important for bone mass and overall health. But its frustrating to figure out how hard to push myself so that I get a workout without destroying myself for my workouts the next day. I always opt out of strength training to save myself for the rides/run/swims."
triathlon,3csxkp,Technicolor-Panda,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:54 2015 UTC,In my experience women get the most benefits from strength work as typically they come from a lower base. So you will quickly notice any gains made.  Also the other advantage is most women tend not do strength work- so you really notice you start to fly past the other girls up the hills and when everyone is fatiguing at the end
triathlon,3csxkp,augustburnsfed,3,Sat Jul 11 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"I generally do strength training twice per week but if I am running out of time it is the first workout to be axed. I find squats in particular seem to help me with hills on the bike.  Lately I have been doing 1 day heavy: lateral pull downs, bench presses, squats, calf raises, lateral raises, triceps kickbacks, biceps curls, legs presses, and abs. Sometimes I add in a few other things. I usually do 2 sets of 12 and don't go horribly heavy.  On the second day I have been taking a BodyPump class lately. It is an hour long muscular endurance class.  I find that the added strength seems to help with injury prevention. I believe the theory is that it stabilizes your joints and helps with bone strength as well."
triathlon,3csxkp,rotosound,2,Sat Jul 11 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same boat. I have been seeing an increase in efficiency on my aero position and run as well as increase in speed. I also try to do at least three days of strength training. Usually I'll do my cardio early early in the morning, eat breakfast, wait another hour or so and then hit the gym. Items my body recover enough I feel like and it's been working for me."
triathlon,3csxkp,ZenTriBrett,2,Sat Jul 11 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"I've been doing Stronglifts 5x5 for a while. I typically lift 3 times per week, usually at night after wife and kids are asleep.  I'll increase to 4 times per week if my next ""A"" race is more than a few months away and during the winter.  Then cut back on the weights as race day gets closer.  I've found running related injuries have decreased  significantly, despite my overall running volume and intensity increasing. I used to get recurrent hip adductor strains and hamstring strains. The squat work and deadlifts in Stronglifts has basically put an end to those.  That alone is enough to keep me lifting.  Tendonitis in my shoulders due to my crappy freestyle form is better.  Short of a crash, I rarely have andy cycling injuries, but I feel like the strength training has helped me get into and maintain a more aero position on my tri bike.  Overall I feel like it's been a huge help to me with no ill effects.  Not that it matters, but my quads and calf muscles have never looked better ;-)"

triathlon,3csxkp,conjunctionjunction1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:25:11 2015 UTC,During triathlon season I limit my strength training. I do work on core strength 1-2 days a week and then 1 day a week I may do an upper body strength training workout. My rationale is based on recovery time. I feel like with 9-13 hours of weekly triathlon workouts my body needs all the time it can get to recover. I don't feel adding significant strength training would allow enough recovery time for my body

triathlon,3csp23,hockeystimpy99,4,Fri Jul 10 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"For your first suit go for an entry level and save your money. You will gain wet suit experience this way. If you stick with the sport and want to graduate to a more expensive suit you will know what you are looking for. Then you can rent something and evaluate it with a more experience pov.  If you are swimming in relatively warm conditions you can save a great deal of money going for a sleeveless suit. I would do this if you are a better swimmer as there is less flotation in those types of suits. I have a cheap suit (aquasphere pursuit) and have never bothered to upgrade it. I have done Olympic and sprints plus training in fairly cold conditions (ontario, canada) and it did the trick for me."

I'm not an extremely fast swimmer, so this was a better choice for me than a thinner suit that wouldn't offer the buoyancy."
triathlon,3csp23,Crona149,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:27:28 2015 UTC,"I follow the /r/BuyItForLife advice, which is when starting a hobby, buy cheap gear. That's because (a) you might not stick with the hobby, and (b) picking out the best gear for you generally requires experience anyway.  So I recommend an Xterra entry-level suit (the Volt, I think) and wear that for the rest of this season. I expect that like most online retailers, you can exchange if the first one you order doesn't fit.   Next year, if you're still into triathlons, you should know what features you prefer in sufficient detail to wisely pick something more expensive, plus you probably will have stabilized on body weight."

triathlon,3cmshg,kmk644,7,Thu Jul 9 03:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yes! I did it back in 2012. Back then, it was held in 3rd week of August. They've changed it because of the heat - and they are totally right about it. So, here are my opinions about the race:  -Swimming: we were swimming in the river - little bit of swimming against the current of the water, and the rest with the current. The current was very little, so it has very small effect on you swimming. We were swimming without wet suits, because of the weather - I have no idea whats the wet suit policy at the moment. The start is very early, so make sure you get plenty of sleep. Also, the swim start is pretty unique - you just jump in the water, one-by-one, so if you want to be one of the first ones to jump in the water, make sure you show up 45' prior to the pro start - no kidding.   T1:  After you get out of water, you will have around 200-300yrd to your bike. The transition is pretty standard I would say - bags, tents, etc.   Bike course:  I don't know if they've changed something to the bike course, but when I was doing my IM, the course had 2-3 short uphill. Besides that, it is flat, and has one really cool part, where all of the 'cheerleading' families gather - I can't remember the name of the city, but you bike through it twice. The road conditions were pretty good - cannot recall any bad roads.   T2: same as T1 :)  Running: Now, this is my favourite part. Louisville makes such a great cheering job. This was by far my favourite running course because of amount of people who just relax on the street and cheer! There are 2 loops, through the downtown, and to suburbs. You literally run by the biggest buildings in the city, and after 5 miles you run by somebodies house :) Really cool experience. There are drinking/food points every mile, so make sure you dont eat TO MUCH! :)  Expo: Really good expo. Tons of stores that give you really good discounts. If you have chance, sign up for massage - this will do god to your muscles. Also, I recommend staying in the official IM hotel. Its really good way to meet new people.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask them! I highly recommend Louisville, and I can't wait to come back there. This was my first and only IM, and every since then, I am training for 70.3's. I did pretty well as for 3 months of training - 6:30 (my first 70.3)/13:45 (Louisville). Now I am racing at 4:30 for 70.3, so really cant wait to test myself on the Louisville course :)  Cheers! Sorry for grammar mistakes, but Im Polish :)  TLDR:  Swimming: unique start, one-by-one, check wetsuit policy. Bike: couple of short uphills, the rest is flat. Running: amazing."
triathlon,3cmshg,_uksz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:17:51 2015 UTC,check wetsuit policy   I believe it is contingent on the temp of the water. Now that it's moved to Oct the water temp is estimated to be wet suit legal (I forget what the exact temp it has to be though)
triathlon,3cmshg,mojomagic66,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:19:14 2015 UTC,What was your nutrition plan?
triathlon,3cmshg,_uksz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:47:12 2015 UTC,"Good question. If I remember right, I had one gel after the swimming part. I was hydrating a lot! I took 2 bottles of water/iso at each station of cycling, and I had total of like 9 gels on the cycling part (I was going for 1 each 40'-50').At the marathon I was totally exhausted, so I just ate 'what felt right'. I didnt felt good after all of that sugar, so I used some of the pretzels and chicken broth. On top of gels. :)"
triathlon,3cmshg,CheesyConey,3,Thu Jul 9 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"I did Louisville last year and can tell you that the move to October is definitely going to make your life much easier.  The swim isn't too bad, with about 2/3 of it with the current.  The first 1/3 is against the current, but for most of that you have Towhead Island blocking most of it.  There is a small portion where you're against the current without the island as a buffer, and this is where lots of people started having a tough time, so be prepared to gut it out and get around that turn buoy.  On the plus side, the October race means you'll probably get to use a wetsuit (it'll at least be in the gray area), so that makes life easier.  The bike course is sneaky tough.  There is an out and back that has a pretty decent sized down-up hill (think a V shape instead of an A shape), but that comes early enough that you should be fresh and have no trouble with it.  The rest of the course is rollers, so you won't get to settle in your aerobars like you would in an IM like Florida or Maryland.  Overall there's about 5,000 ft of climbing on the course, so not terrible, but by no means something to ignore.  Road conditions were pretty good last year, with a few potholes on the out and back section (this is where I saw the most flats).  This is where my account will probably be less useful as I spent 2 hours in the Med-Tent in T2 with heat exhaustion (the heat index of 115 last year was no bueno).  What I can tell you is that the volunteers are the best and will do everything in their power to make this the experience of a lifetime.  The run course is phenomenally flat, and will be much less daunting with cooler October weather.  If you want to read a more detailed account of my experience last year, you can find that here.  Best of luck this year!  Just let me know if you have any questions!"
triathlon,3cmshg,CheesyConey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:45:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for responding. What did you do as far as in-race nutrition? Did you have a set plan or did you just consume what felt right at the time?
triathlon,3cmshg,CheesyConey,2,Thu Jul 9 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"A gel every 40 minutes on the bike and 750 mL of electrolyte drink every hour.  Another 500 mL of water every hour (I sweat a lot) as well.  Then I had salt sticks in case of emergency, as well as a Clif bar and some applesauce packets in my special needs bag.  I'm testing out some new stuff for this year, namely Uncrustables, to see if I can't get more solid food into my stomach on the bike.  By the time I got out on the run course all hell had broken loose, so I was just kind of going with what I felt.  Lots of pretzels and grapes in the beginning, and then as i got into the second lap I started drinking flat Coke.  Just as a warning though, once you start drinking the Coke you have to keep drinking it or you'll crash, so it should really only be a last resort IMHO."

triathlon,3cmshg,mojomagic66,2,Fri Jul 10 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"I don't really have any advice for you, except that it looks like a fun race.  My best friend lives in Louisville and it's a big deal in the city.  I was actually registered to go this year but a bike-van crash has changed my plans this season and I had to withdraw.  I'm still thinking of heading out to volunteer (and make sure I can sign up for 2016!), so maybe I'll see you there.  Historically the water temps around early October are in the 60s, so it should be comfortable with a wet suit.  I drove the bike course with my friend and there are definitely some serious hills in it (to me, anyway)... after heading out of town for about 10 miles, then it climbs up then it goes in and out of this valley at different points.  The run seems mostly flat and heads out of downtown and does 2 loops up and down Southern Parkway.  It's lined with big trees, but I don't know if the actual run route has you running in their shade.  My friend says lots of people living along the route like to go out and drink and cheer the athletes along.  Friends who have done multiple IMs have said the finish for Louisville is one of the best and most vibrant.  Good luck!"

triathlon,3ck2rb,Davy_Dee,23,Wed Jul 8 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"I'm very self conscious about this because I don't wanna be THAT GUY who always talks about his training and races. However, I would argue that since this sport has became such a big part of my life all my friends only know me now as 'the guy who trains for tri's all day every day,"" so when I see them at parties and they want to catch up with me that's pretty much the only thing they ask about."
triathlon,3ck2rb,JeffJWille,9,Wed Jul 8 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"Ha! I was just thinking the same thing... damn I'm that guy. If I don't talk about my training I have nothing else to talk about, I train all morning, work all day, train in the afternoon then cuddle with my wife in front of the TV for an hour then go to bed... it's not a bad life but it's not particularly interesting."
triathlon,3ck2rb,mojomagic66,8,Wed Jul 8 18:25:11 2015 UTC,I think it might be worst for people doing full distance. There's just no room for anything else.
triathlon,3ck2rb,megagreg,2,Wed Jul 8 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even before I started training for IMLou I've always known I could do a half w/out training so I didn't see the point in paying $350+ for only a half. Plus if your long runs are only maybe 10 miles at most and your long rides say maybe 60-70 that leaves a lot of extra time in the day to do other shit... but when you're running 14-16 mile runs and 100+ mile rides you really don't have much time or energy to do anything else."

What triggered me to do one is someone suggesting I do it before I have kids, and I'm impressed that you're able to manage both. Were you already into long distances when you had kids, or did you start training afterwards? I've noticed recently that it's a lot easier to maintain training gains than to acquire them. I'm hoping that will translate into still being able to race hard when I have some little ones in a couple years."
triathlon,3ck2rb,megagreg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:18:22 2015 UTC,"i pretty much put everything off until the youngest was 6.  i did odd and off cycling but any serious training i put off until they no longer really needed me.  course that meant first kid at 34 and last one at 41 meant i did my first IM at 50 (actually 51 maybe?).  :)  for me, family is much more important."

I don't have to talk about my training, but if people want to talk to me then let's be honest, that's the only thing in my life besides work and my girlfriend. I wake up at 5am everyday, workout before work, work 8-5 and then workout until 8pm. Eat and then be in bed around 10 to do it all over again. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but when someone asks me what I did last night or over the weekend then my training is pretty much the only honest answer i can give."

I'll probably just sign up for another or just start bike racing more since I hate running. PM me if you wanna train via strava! Good luck in Lou!"

You can easily click on a state and sort by date range and triathlon. You can also search within a specific county with the advanced search, or try googling some relatively large cities along with the website name and that should let you view all events in some radius from that city.

I highly recommend Beach2Battleship half if it's not too far for you. I did the full last year and lived it and I've hear the half is even more enjoyable. If you want a cheap challenging one you can check out the finish strong half iron from FS series. These are both NC races but I live in raleigh so its kinda all I know"

I don't make much money to begin with, and for me to spend 2000 USD on an ENTRY level tri bike is insane. Luckily that is just a ""one-time"" cost. Most half distances here are 300-400 USD and the full distance is twice that if you want to race Challenge or Ironman. Then you have to find a hotel. And you also have to pay the USAT one-day fee. After it's all said and done, it's a lot of money. I just did Challenge Atlantic City and luckily I was able to stay with a friend at Bally's free of charge because he's just a really nice guy. Ugh... it's an expensive sport. But it's also the most rewarding ;)"
triathlon,3cjfr8,HurleyBurger,3,Wed Jul 8 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"The annoying thing is it doesn't have to be this way. My first tri was an olympic and it cost something like £90 (~$130) to enter. I had the cheapest wetsuit, did the bike segment on my battered old touring bike, and they had a free campground for competitors. It was in many ways a much nicer event because so many 'ordinary' people were doing it along with the pros. It's a shame they never did it again really, it was such a nice weekend. Festival of Sport 2012 for anyone who's interested."
triathlon,3cjfr8,mojomagic66,3,Wed Jul 8 17:47:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly the price is comparable if you look at it as 3 separate events. I'm not sure what an open water swim registration would be but we can be generous and say $50usd then we'll be generous again and say $100 for the marathon and $200 for a century ride. That puts us at $450 then we could add the cost for the backpack, hat, and medal (idk maybe $80). Then you have the logistics of essentially taking over an entire city (large city at that) the Police department gets paid to direct traffic... you have t-shirts for hundreds of volunteers. Water stops, aide stations, medical stations... The cost is pretty astronomical if you're comparing it to other endurance sports like a marathon but if you really break it down it seems fair to me...   That being said I'm racing on credit at this point."

triathlon,3cjfr8,pack_of_wolves,3,Wed Jul 8 11:41:10 2015 UTC,"A long distance triathlon is expensive to organize. A dwindling number of participants is usually the reason an organisation decides to pay 100 000 euro or so fee to become part of the challenge or ironman brand. If you look carefully, you will find local full tri's here and there in Europe. The license thing is for insurance reasons and has not much to do with the organization. Would camping be an option for you?"
triathlon,3cjfr8,anothertriathlete,5,Wed Jul 8 12:57:15 2015 UTC,Camping is the current plan. There doesn't seem to be much available in terms of campgrounds but I bet there would be one that could squeeze my little 2-man tent into a corner somewhere if I just show up.

triathlon,3cjfr8,mojomagic66,-2,Wed Jul 8 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I was being slightly sarcastic, but under many state laws homeowners have the right to 'defend' themselves, and typically won't be prosecuted for shooting someone.  So even if it's rare, it DOES happen, legally, whereas it's the opposite in Sweden."
triathlon,3cjfr8,anothertriathlete,3,Wed Jul 8 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"Nope not even close.  In general, property owners cannot use deadly force to protect property. But property owners may be able to shoot at trespassers in self-defense if they fear great bodily harm or death.  The law gives property owners the right to defend themselves with a reasonable response. That means any force used against a trespasser must usually be proportionate to harm that is reasonably perceived.  tl;dr: You would get prosecuted for shooting an athlete who attempted to camp in your woods."

triathlon,3cjfr8,TunaBoo,3,Wed Jul 8 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"Do you train on closed roads and marked water ways?  DIY is really not that hard to organize. It obviously won't have the bells and whistles of banners and blow up finish lines and water buoys, but there is great satisfaction in just getting out there and doing your own thing. Find a few friends or training partners to join along with you for either part or the whole thing.   I have quite a few running friends that organize their own marathons regularly. They get together for dinner the night before, then go out and drive their planned ""race"" route and tape water bottles to stop signs or hide some snacks in some bushes as aid stations. Either that or they plan the route to pass someone's house where they'll place a stocked cooler. Our local fire station allows them to keep water bottles there as well so that's usually a regular spot on their route.   The hardest part for DIY tri is the swimming portion, but that's where your creativity comes into play. Usually start at a pool and swim a bunch of laps. We're lucky here in Minnesota in that we have so many lakes to choose from, but many in the metro area don't allow open swimming outside of the marked beaches. Find a friend with a canoe and hijack a rural lake somewhere and have them canoe alongside of you for support. Obviously don't swim alone."

I really do not have much advice to give you for motivation other than, grin and bear it.  This time pay the additional fees and compete, because the event is what it is all about.  Yes, the hoops suck and the hidden fees make the event less than pleasurable. Stick it to em.  Finish the race, go for broke, then never do another one of their events again.

If you need one, it's 175:- for a day.  Glad I got the email, I forgot to renew my race license. :o   As for Kalmar and hotels. Yeah it sucks. 2 years ago, I stayed 45m out at my gf's parent's friend's place. This year, I booked my hotel the Sunday after the 2014 race and am staying for only 1650:-/night (3 nights). It's expensive, but IM Canada was the same prices and procedures, IM Copenhagen was the same prices and procedures...  Is this your first Ironman event?"
triathlon,3cjfr8,Suckat3,-2,Mon Jul 13 16:07:17 2015 UTC,Sounds like you waited to the last minuet to book housing knowing that you couldn't commute home. In the U.S. We have to have a usat membership to race. Sounds like nothing out of the ordinary.

triathlon,3cjfr8,Suckat3,0,Wed Jul 8 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"Today Ironman send me a mail (conveniently just after the last point at which I can withdraw or transfer) saying I must be a member of a Swedish triathlon club in order to be able to race, I must also have a race license. That's another 1000kr + 320kr on top of the race fee (4500kr).    Won't a USAT license be enough? Requiring a sport license in order to race is normal in Europe.  I'd be surprised if the race organizers didn't mention it though...   Anyone else ever feel like this? Any advice or motivation for me?   Sounds like you didn't take all the costs into account before signing up. In long distance tri you almost always have to book a hotel the night before the race, you have transportation costs...  The bad news is: you'll have to pay for it all now that you've signed up.  The good news is: you don't need the WTC or big organizations to race. Find local tris, find friends willing to share transport and/or accomodation."

triathlon,3clrqj,Treehousebrickpotato,2,Wed Jul 8 22:10:34 2015 UTC,I have had a few different brands. Each of them required me to go for a few mile run while making adjustments. Usually by the end of the run I am feeling good. The first time I did this it took 2 or 3 runs. I got better with practice of course ;)

I've got myself some elastic laces and I found that it's easy to over tighten them and when you do it sometimes (depending on the trainers) causes the lace hoops toward the front of the shoe (toe end) to get over tight. It's like it actually builds and builds, getting tighter every time you pop them on quick. So every so often I have to fully open up the shoe before putting them on and it feels much more comfortable.  If that's of no help, maybe this video on how to use the extra holes on your shoes might?  video  Anyways, best of luck to you!"

I'm still dialing in my nutrition strategy. I used the Portman Calculator to find a baseline calories/hour. I know more or less what kinds of fuel agree with me.   I just need to nail down exactly what, when and how much I take in for race day. Curious to know others' experiences."
triathlon,3cicch,arsenalrule,2,Wed Jul 8 11:26:44 2015 UTC,"Figuring out my nutrition was a big stressor.  I read a lot.  Most everything says to not take on too much,  that's when the gastric distress starts.  I think I have a pretty solid stomach and not too much upsets it. Hammer Nutrition has a quite extensive and in depth knowledge base on their website -  and I really like their products.   The notion of having a bit of protein along with the carbs for fuel was different than just using sugars but seems to work.   I filled a regular bike bottle with multiple portions of the sustain powder.  It's thick but it drew lines on the bottle that divided into 3 sections so I knew how much to take over each hour.   Try and keep it simple,  write it down and go over numerous times so that it's not a challenge to remember your plan during the race."

triathlon,3ck0o9,mojomagic66,5,Wed Jul 8 14:46:09 2015 UTC,Tri shoes are not much of an advantage for a full. Ironman branded races don't let non-pros put shoes on their bikes. Tri shoes are generally more breathable and dry quickly when Gatorade or another yellow liquid makes it's way down your legs mid-race.
triathlon,3ck0o9,Triiiathlete,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"I think it varies by race. Timberman was g2g with flying mounts last year, and nothing prohibits it in this year's athlete guide either."
triathlon,3ck0o9,Suckat3,2,Wed Jul 8 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"IMTX this year allowed flying mounts as well. However I only did it due to how muddy Transition was. I ran barefoot out of T1 to the pavement, rinsed feet for 5 seconds in a kiddy pool and jumped on the bike.  If it had not been muddy I would have just put them on in the changing tent."

triathlon,3ck0o9,lordrashmi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"I knew mounting was OK at 70.3 distance. I kept my shoes on my bike for Timberman as well. I thought flying mounts were prohibited at all IM-branded fulls, but it looks like I was mistaken."
triathlon,3ck0o9,Triiiathlete,2,Wed Jul 8 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"TL; DR: It depends.   Are they worth the investment for a full?   Investments are dictated by goals. If your goal is to finish the race, they're probably not a worthy investment. If your goal is to Kona qualify, PR, or achieve a certain time at the edge of your abilities, looking for speed that can be bought rather than earned through training starts to matter. When you start to get into this category, there's a lot of items that might come in before tri shoes; wheels, aero helmet, tri-suit, quick laces, number belts, and aero hydration systems, for a few examples.   If you're at the point where that inventory is happening, then a pair of tri shoes should probably be on your list, accompanied by ample practice with flying mounts/dismounts before race day."
triathlon,3ck0o9,Suckat3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:44:01 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, the only advantage that Tri-Shoes give the wearer compared to standard cycling shoes is that it makes transitions much faster (they have a loop for rubber bands, tightened and adjusted easily etc).  I don't own a pair of Tri-Shoes and I've been racing for years. It is on my list of things to invest in this year though, to save some time in T1/T2."

A lot of times creaking is salt built up in the seat tube or stem. A thorough cleaning and greasing usually takes it away. Although one time for me it was a dirty worn out Bottom Bracket that needed to be replaced.   Excellent work to stick with it after all those bike issues.

triathlon,3cfq1x,Mal_Adjusted,2,Tue Jul 7 17:26:20 2015 UTC,I actually picked up the vector pro from this year and I would assume they have similar fits based off of what I tried on and their size guide located here: http://www.xterrawetsuits.com/pages/size-guide  I'm 6 foot and 185 lbs. i went with the large sized suit based on the guide. I have somewhat large thighs and the suit is a bit snug in that area. The chest is just a bit loose but has never bothered me.  If that kind of tightness were on my shoulders it would limit my movement and be an issue.  The suit is very buoyant and the first couple of open water swims immediately made me realize that I wasn't going to drown during my tri. I did put a deep gash in the suit on the back of my calf by putting it on like an idiot.   Otherwise I am happy with my purchase. And would recommend it. You also need to search for xterra wetsuits coupons. You should be able to find 60% off.

It is backordered in my size.  My tri here in a couple weeks will probably not be wet suit legal, but I am targeting some more this fall that should be.  Now I just gotta decide if I want the vortex and wait a couple weeks or the vector for a little more money and have it in the case my tri on 7/18 ends up being wetsuit legal.  Thanks again!  Want gold or something?  I would honestly send you some money for a 6 pack or beer or something because this is the first time a online coupon code has actually worked for me."

triathlon,3cfq1x,Voisi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:29:33 2015 UTC,Check the different lines of Xterra suits. With the coupon code they're generally within a $20 of each other.

I don't think it's uncommon in triathlon, even though longer/leaner body types seem to typify those that are active and successful in the sport.  I didn't have any problems buying from Xterra for my first wetsuit; the sizing was proper for their charts. If you have any lingering doubt after reviewing their size charts, consider shooting them an email or giving a call with your measurements and asking the company directly. Worst case, most wet suit companies have good return policies for sizing."
